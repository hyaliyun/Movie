Early years  Carlos di Sarli was born at 511 Buenos Aires street (now Yrigoyen) in the city of Bah√≠a Blanca, located in Southern Argentina. He was the eighth child of the Italian immigrant Miguel Di Sarli, the owner of a gunsmith store, and Serafina Russomano, daughter of the tenor singer Tito Russomano. Baptized as Cayetano di Sarli in accordance with the solid Catholic tradition of his parents, he later changed his name to Carlos. Music played an important role in the family: Carlos' older brother Domingo was a teacher at the Williams music conservatory in Bah√≠a Blanca, Nicolas, another older child, became a famous baritone, and Carlos' younger brother, Roque, turned into a pianist. Carlos received training in classical music in the conservatory where his brother was teaching. In 1916, working in his father's store, he suffered an accident that cost him an eye and which forced him to wear glasses for the rest of his life. Once recovered from the accident, 13-year-old Carlos joined a company of traveling musicians, touring various provinces and playing popular music including tangos. Then he moved to Santa Rosa in the La Pampa province where a friend of his father, another Italian immigrant by the name of Mario Manara, owned a cinema and a club. He played piano there for two years, accompanying silent movies and performing early tango songs at the club. In 1919, he returned to Bah√≠a Blanca and set up his first orchestra, playing at the Cafe Express on the corner of Zelarrayan and Buenos Aires streets, and in Cafe Moka, on O'Higgins street. The orchestra also did tours in the provinces La Pampa, C√≥rdoba, Mendoza, San Juan and Salta. In 1923, Carlos and his younger brother Roque moved to Buenos Aires.  Active years as a musician  There, with the help of Alberico Spatola, the composer of the tango El trece and the director of the Buenos Aires police orchestra, he was able to join the band of Anselmo Aieta. In early 1924, Carlos joined an orchestra directed by the violin player Juan Pedro Castillo, and later, the trio of Alejandro Scarpino (the composer of Canaro en Paris). He accompanied the actress and singer Olinda Boz√°n on her recordings for the Electra label and worked as part of a sextet in the cabaret Chantecler. Thanks to a recommendation from Jos√© P√©cora, a violin player, he joined Osvaldo Fresedo's orchestra in 1926 and played at the opening night of the F√©nix theater in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of Flores. Fresedo became an important influence on di Sarli's music as well as a good friend. The tango Viejo milonguero, which di Sarli composed around 1927-28 was dedicated to Fresedo. It was around the same time that Juan \\"Pacho\\" Maglio and Jos√© Mar√≠a Rizzutti recorded the tango Meditaci√≥n which di Sarli had composed around 1919 but never recorded himself. In late 1927 he started to set up his own sextet or orchestra tipica (Jos√© P√©cora and David Abramsky on violin, C√©sar Ginzo and Tito Land√≥ on bandone√≥n and Adolfo Kraus on bass), directing it from behind the piano that he himself played. With the orchestra, di Sarli played live in clubs as well as radio shows in Radio Cultura and recorded for the label RCA Victor. In addition to instrumentals, he recorded with the vocalists Santiago Devincenzi (who later changed his last name to Devin), Ernesto Fam√° and Fernando D√≠az. These singers were hired only to sing the short verses (\\"estribillos\\") during the performances and were not constant members of his orchestra, unlike the musicians. Between November 26, 1928 and August 14, 1931, he recorded 48 tracks including the tangos T.B.C. by Edgardo Donato, Maldita by Antonio Rodio and Celedonio Flores, and the Eduardo Arolas compositions La guitarrita and Una noche de garufa. In 1930, during a performance in the caf√© El Germinal, di Sarli had an argument with one of the caf√©'s owners who did not understand that he wore dark glasses on stage for medical reasons because of his accident at age 13. Di Sarli promptly moved with his orchestra to Bah√≠a Blanca, where he performed at the La Central club. In 1932, Antonio Rodr√≠guez Lesende joined the orchestra as a singer. In 1934, for unclear reasons, di Sarli left the orchestra and moved to Rosario in Santa Fe province where he joined a small band with the bandone√≥n player Juan Cambareri, the violin player Alberto Saikievich and the singer Roberto Pieri. His sextet continued to play without him, later changing its name to Orquesta Novel due to their performances at the club Novelty. At the request of the orchestra's members in 1935, di Sarli rejoined the band temporarily to replace the pianist Ricardo Canataro who was ill at the time. In late 1938, di Sarli reorganized his orchestra and in January 1939 debuted in Radio El Mundo. His orchestra consisted of Roberto Guisado, √Ångel Goicoechea and Adolfo P√©rez on violin, Roberto Gianitelli, Domingo S√°nchez and Roberto Mititieri on bandone√≥n and Domingo Capurro on bass. The singer was Ignacio Murillo, soon to be replaced by Roberto Rufino who was 16 years old at the time. On December 11, 1939, they recorded for RCA Victor the tangos Coraz√≥n (composed by di Sarli, with Hector Marco's lyrics) and Retirao by Carlos Posadas. He stayed with this recording label until 1949, when he withdrew from tango for commercial reasons. In November 1951, he returned to the label Music Hall until April 1953 recording 84 tracks with the vocals of Mario Pomar and Oscar Serpa. From June 1954 until 1958 he returned to the RCA Victor label, leaving that year for Philips to record his last 14 tracks with Horacio Casares and Jorge Dur√°n.  Last orchestra lineup  Since 1958, in addition to Di Sarli on the piano, the orchestra included the violinists Roberto Guisado, Elvino Vardaro, A. Rouco, Szymsia Bajour, Carlos Arnaiz, Juan Schiaffino, C. Gonz√°lez and A. Rossi; the bandone√≥n players F. Verdi, Jos√© Libertella, Juli√°n Plaza, A. Marcucci y D. S√°nchez; A. Sciarretta on bass and the singers Horacio Casares and Jorge Dur√°n. Di Sarli, already seriously ill, gave his last performance on March 8, 1959, in the club Podest√° de Lan√∫s, finishing with a performance of Bah√≠a Blanca, his own composition dedicated to his hometown.  His vocalists  During the sextet years, his singers (in chronological order) were Santiago Devin (cenzi), Ernesto Fam√°, Fernando D√≠az, Antonio Rodr√≠guez Lesende, Roberto Arrieta and Ignacio Murillo. In his later years, larger orchestra Murillo was followed by Roberto Rufino, then Antonio Rodr√≠guez Lesende, Agust√≠n Volpe, Carlos Acu√±a, Alberto Podest√°, again Roberto Rufino, then again Alberto Podest√°, Osvaldo Cabrera, Roberto Rufino for a third time, Alberto Podest√° for a third time, Jorge Dur√°n, Ra√∫l Rosales, Alberto Podest√° for the fourth time, Osvaldo Cord√≥, Oscar Serpa, Mario Pomar, again Oscar Serpa, Argentino Ledesma, Rodolfo Gal√©, Roberto Florio, and finally Jorge Dur√°n again and Horacio Casares.  Di Sarli's musical style  In the beginning, his music had a simple structure, but over time it matured into a more lyrical, richer, playful and more subtle style which remained popular with tango dancers as it continued to have a clear dancing beat. This clean comp√°s made him a favorite of beginning social tango dancers, while more advanced ones could enjoy the complexity and variations of his music. Because of this, di Sarli's orchestra was among the most popular ones during Carnival balls of his age and can still be heard at milongas in Buenos Aires and around the world today. Di Sarli moved beyond the style of the guardia vieja of tango and Julio de Caro's avant-garde, preferring to forge his own style without concession to the fashions of the day. While being influenced by Fresedo early on, he soon established his own way. A talented piano player, he directed his orchestra from behind his own instrument. His recordings do not feature significant instrumental solos; the bandone√≥ns at times carry the melody but essentially play a rhythmical, milonguero role. Only the violins stand out, playing a short solo or a counterpoint melody. He recorded many tracks more than once over the years, often with different singers. Di Sarli's creativity was mostly limited to the left hand piano part, filling in, modulating and accenting his delicate and elegant dancing beat. His reputation for musical elegance got him his nickname El Se√±or del Tango (The gentleman of tango).

The University of W√ºrzburg is one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in Germany, having been founded in 1402. The university initially had a brief run and was closed in 1415. It was reopened in 1582 on the initiative of Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn. Today, the university is named for Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn and Maximilian Joseph. The University of W√ºrzburg is part of the U15 group of research-intensive German universities. The university is also a member of the Coimbra Group. Name Neue Universit√§t main building, built in 1896 Its official name is Julius-Maximilians-Universit√§t W√ºrzburg (or \\"Julius- Maximilian University of W√ºrzburg\\") but it is commonly referred to as the University of W√ºrzburg. This name is taken from Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn, Prince-Bishop of W√ºrzburg, who reestablished the university in 1582, and Prince Elector Maximilian Joseph, the prince under whom secularization occurred at the start of the 19th century. The university‚Äôs central administration, foreign student office, and several research institutes are located within the area of the old town, while the new liberal arts campus, with its modern library, overlooks the city from the east. The university today enrolls approximately 29,000 students, out of which more than 1,000 come from other countries. History Establishment in 1402 Old University, drawing from the 17th or 18th century Although the university was first founded in 1402, it was short-lived. This was attributed to the lack of financial security and the instability of the age. Johannes Trithemius, well- known humanist and learned abbot of the Scottish monastery of St. Jacob, held the then dissolute student lifestyle responsible for the premature decline of the city's first university. In the Annales Hirsaugiensis Chronologia Mystica of 1506 he cites bathing, love, brawling, gambling, inebriation, squabbling, and general pandemonium as \\"greatly impeding the academic achievement in W√ºrzburg\\". Evidence of this is provided by the fatal stabbing of the university's first chancellor, Johann Zantfurt, in 1413, by a scholar's unruly assistant, or famulus, evidently the result of these very influences. Despite Egloffstein's thwarted first attempt at founding a university, the city still boasts one of the oldest universities in the German-speaking world, almost on a par with Prague (1348), Vienna (1365), Heidelberg (1386), Cologne (1388), and Erfurt (1392). 1582‚Äì1945 A university in W√ºrzburg was refounded more than 150 years later. A \\"second founding\\" by Prince Bishop Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn (1545‚Äì1617) in 1582 offered the institution guaranteed autonomous self-government. The university was fiercely Roman Catholic and initially considered a \\"bastion of Catholicism in the face of Protestantism\\", words also used in the university charter which prevented all non-Catholics from graduating from or receiving tenure at the Alma Julia. Echter intended it as a tool of Counter-Reformation. Over a century would pass before the university opened its doors to non-Catholics, in keeping with the spirit of Enlightenment encouraged by Prince Bishop Friedrich Karl von Sch√∂nborn's newly formulated students' charter of 1734. The resultant increase in religious tolerance even enabled the summoning and subsequent appointment of the famous physician, Karl Kaspar von Siebold, under Sch√∂nborn's successor, Adam Friedrich von Seinsheim. Shortly after his arrival in 1769, Protestant medical students were permitted to study for their doctorates at the university. W√ºrzburg's increasing secularisation as a bishopric and its eventual surrender to Bavarian rule at the beginning of the 19th century resulted in the loss of the university's Roman Catholic character. The end of the city's status as a Grand Duchy under Ferdinand of Toscana in 1814 heralded the Alma Julia's ideological transition to the non-denominational establishment which endures to this day. This new inclusiveness towards professors and students alike was instrumental in the resultant upturn in all areas of research and education in the 19th century. Since then, the university has borne the name of its second and most influential founder, officially known as the Julius-Maximilians-Universit√§t of Bavaria. The many medical accomplishments associated with the university from the mid- to late-19th century were inextricably linked with achievements in the affiliated field of natural science, notably by Schwab, the eminent botanist, Semper, the zoologist, Wislicenus, the celebrated chemist and Boveri, the biologist. Their progress culminated in the discovery of x-rays by physicist Wilhelm Conrad R√∂ntgen, first winner of the Nobel Prize for Physics, in 1895. R√∂ntgen's discovery, which he dubbed a \\"new kind of ray\\", is regarded as the university's greatest intellectual achievement, and, simultaneously, a scientific development of huge global import. R√∂ntgen's successors, namely Wilhelm Wien, Johannes Stark and the chemists Emil Fischer and Eduard Buchner, also number among the succession of Nobel Prize winners to lecture at the university, a tradition which endures in the modern-day example of Klaus von Klitzing. 1945 to today After World War II, the free state of Bavaria invested a fortune in the rebuilding and renovation of the university buildings, which had been severely damaged by Allied bombing. Restoration of Echter's \\"Old University\\", current home to the faculty of law, continues today. The eventual rebuilding of the Neubaukirche (\\"Neubau Church\\"), also affiliated to the legal faculty and almost razed to the ground in 1945, marked the end of the city's extensive reconstruction process. In 1970 it was decided that the church, one of the most important examples of 16th century vaulted architecture in southern Germany, should fulfill a dual function as a place of worship and as the university banquet, assembly, and concert hall. Echter's heart, removed for safekeeping during the war, has once again found its place in the church he designed, fulfilling a request made during his lifetime.

He developed dramatic arrangements that retained strong elements of the walking beat of salon tango but also heralded the development of concert-style tango music. His father, Don Adolfo Pugliese, pushed him to work harder; his mother, Aurelia Terragno, often whispered to her son while he was practicing, al Colon (to the Colon), referring to Buenos Aires\` famous Colon Theater, where only the country\`s finest artists play. His other brothers Adolfo Vincente and Alberto Roque were violinists. In 1918 he left primary school to work as a print graphic artist. His father finally convinced him to take classes with the teacher Antonio D'Agostino, at the Conservatorio Odeon. Some of his music, mostly since the 1950s, is used for theatrical dance performances. In Buenos Aires, Pugliese is often played later in the evening when the dancers want to dance more slowly, impressionistically and intimately. Pugliese is a great choice for slower tango dance music, but the arrangements can be a bit more rhythmically challenging than those played by other orchestras. He wrote his first tango, Recuerdo, or Memory, in 1924, when he was 19. Two years later, when it was finally recorded, it became a classic. 'La yumba' (1946) is another famous and most popular Pugliese's tangos compositions. Pugliese was outspoken in his political opinions. His communist sympathies, though never violent, at times earned him the hostility of those in power. Populist President Juan Per√≥n is said to have had labor union heavies once intimidate Pugliese by locking him in a sinking boat, rescuing him at the last minute; though the alleged 1949 incident has never been proven (Pugliese, likewise, seldom spoke of it publicly), the day Pres. Per√≥n awarded the great pianist the Order of May (Argentina's highest civilian award), he embraced Pugliese, saying: \\"Thank you, maestro, for forgiving\\".Clar√≠n, 26 July 1995. Pugliese reportedly responded, \\"Forgive what?\\" Pugliese was a man of integrity and humility. He spent years in jail due to his beliefs. The government also restricted his recordings to 10 per year. As a communist, he organised his orchestra as a collective paid his orchestra by their contribution, and earned their loyalty. Quite rare, his core orchestra members (Osvaldo Ruggiero 1st bandoneon, Enrique Camerano 1st violin, Julio Carrasco and Oscar Herrero 2nd violins, Alcides Rossi on double bass) stayed with him nearly 30 years (1939-1968). He was a member of the Communist Party starting in 1936. He also managed to help create \\"Sociedad de Musicos y Artistas Afines\\" to increase job stability and wages for musicians. He was married two times, to Mar√≠a Concepci√≥n Florio ‚ÄúCholi‚Äù (in 1936) and to Lydia Elman (1970). His first wife died in 1971, and he had one daughter, Lucia Delma \\"Beba\\" Pugliese, from the marriage. She was born in 1939, and was also a pianist in her own right. In 1939 he formed his orchestra as a cooperative and made his debut at Cafe National (Av. Corrientes 980 - \\"Cathedral of Tango\\") on the 11th of August, 1939. The orchestra toured the former Soviet Union in 1959 (eighty cities in three months -- sometimes playing two or three shows a day) and also China (twenty- eight cities in another month), Chile (1990), Mexico, Columbia (1980), Peru, Cuba (1984, 1988, 1992), Japan (1965, 135 shows in five months; 1979, 1989), the U.S. (stopping in Chicago in 1979), the Middle East, France (1984), Portugal, Spain (1985; 1988 playing in Madrid, at Teatro Alb√©niz with the singer Joan Manuel Serrat, and Barcelona), Belgium, The Netherlands (with Piazzolla in Amsterdam, 29th of June 1989), Finland and almost all South and Central American countries: Uruguay (1987, Teatro Sol√≠s de Montevideo). For his work the maestro received high cultural distinctions, including from the Argentine, French and Cuban governments. In 1961, he wrote Milonga Para Fidel to show his support for the Cuban revolution. When he was in jail, he still wrote arrangements and the orchestra still performed, and placed a red carnation on the keyboard of the piano in his honor. The 1960s government of the late General Juan Carlos Ongana (who had a deep fear of Peronists and communists alike) simply banned Pugliese from radio broadcasts and public places. At age 80, he was allowed on the 12th of December 1985 to give a concert in Teatro Colon, in Buenos Aires. He received 5 standing ovations. With characteristic humility he said: ‚ÄúThe truth is...it‚Äôs a night of the people, of the masses, lovers of our genre, our beloved genre, tango.‚Äù The ceremony was led by Luis Brandoni and Hector Larrea. The orchestra's members that night were: Roberto Alvarez, Alejandro Previniano, Fabio Lapinta (bandoneons), Osvaldo Montermi, Fernando Rodriguez, Diego Lerenderi, Gabriel Rivas (violins), Merei Brain (Viola), Emil Cartolosa (double bass) and Osvaldo Pugliese (piano).

It was established in 1920 and also has facilities at Rauma, Pori, Kevo and Salo. The university is a member of the Coimbra Group. History The Royal Academy of Turku The first university to be established in Turku was The Royal Academy of Turku, in 1640, which was transferred to the new Capital, Helsinki, after the Great Fire of Turku in 1827. Three famous Finns began their studies in Turku in 1822. These were Johan Vilhelm Snellman, Elias L√∂nnrot, and Johan Ludvig Runeberg who have a statue on University Hill. Another reminder of the Royal Academy is the Old Academy Building near the University's campus. The University of Turku The grand opening of the University of Turku in 1922. On the left is , the first rector of the university The modern University of Turku was founded in 1920. The Finnish intelligentsia wanted a purely Finnish university, the first of its kind in Finland. 22,040 people contributed to the fund-raising campaign. Newly gained independence and the campaign are reflected in the motto of the University about a free people's gift to free science. To honour the memory of these donors, the University has named its specially created liqueur \\"22 040\\". Developed by the University's own food chemists, the liqueur does homage to some of the distinctive fruits of the Finnish landscape: the cloudberry, the rowan and the sea buckthorn. The first premises of the University of Turku were in the centre of the city, by the market square. In the 1950s a new campus was built on (Russian Hill ‚Äì now known as University Hill). In the 1960s the University started to expand rapidly, a process that still continues. The University was made a public institution in 1974. Since 1995 the University of Turku has been a member of the Coimbra Group. In January 2010, the Turku School of Economics merged with the University of Turku, forming a seventh faculty of the university.

Established in 1290 in Lisbon, it went through a number of relocations until it was moved permanently to its current city in 1537, being one of the oldest universities in continuous operation in the world, the oldest university of Portugal, and one of the country's largest museums of higher education and research institutions. The university is organized into eight different faculties according to a wide range of fields, granting academic bachelor's (licenciado), master's (mestre) and doctorate (doutor) degrees in nearly all major fields of knowledge, such as arts, engineering, humanities, mathematics, natural sciences, social sciences, medicine, sports and technologies. It is a founding member of the Coimbra Group, a group of leading European research universities, whose inaugural meeting it hosted. The University of Coimbra has over 20,000 students, and hosts one of the largest communities of international students in Portugal, arguably being the most cosmopolitan Portuguese university.International Students and Researchers On 22 June 2013, UNESCO added the university to its World Heritage List.World Heritage Centre History King Denis I of Portugal ratified the Studium Generale in Portugal in 1290. Statue of King Denis, in Coimbra The university was founded, or ratified, in 1290 by King Dinis, having begun its existence in Lisbon with the name Studium Generale (Estudo Geral). Scientiae thesaurus mirabilis, the royal charter announcing the institution of the University was dated 1 March of that year, although efforts had been made at least since 1288 to create this first University in Portugal; it is thus the second oldest of such establishments in the Iberian Peninsula. The Papal confirmation was also given in 1290 (on 9 August of that year), during the Papacy of the Pope Nicholas IV. In accordance with the Papal Bull, all the \\"licit\\" Faculties, with the exception of that of Theology, could be established. Thus the Faculties of Arts, Law, Canon Law and Medicine were the first to be created. It was, however, not to remain in Lisbon for long. In 1308, likely due to problems of emancipation from the Church (relations between the latter and the political power being somewhat strained at the time) and conflicts between the inhabitants of the city and the students, the University moved to Coimbra. This town already had old traditions in education, being home to the highly successful school of the Monastery of Santa Cruz. The university was then established on the site known as \\"Estudos Velhos\\", which corresponds roughly to the area where the Main Library now stands. In 1338, during the reign of Afonso IV, it was once again transferred to Lisbon, from whence it returned in 1354, this time to the centre of the town which was then in full expansion. In 1377, during the reign of King Fernando, it was transferred yet again to Lisbon, where it would remain for over a century and a half. The authorization for a Faculty of Theology probably dates from this period ‚Äì around 1380. In 1537, during the reign of Jo√£o III, the university moved definitively to Coimbra, where it was installed in the Alca√ßova Palace which was subsequently purchased from the Royal Family in 1597.https://www.uc.pt/en/informacaopara/visit/paco/greathall, The Royal Palace The university institution, including all the books from its library, were moved from Lisbon to Coimbra. Teachers were not guaranteed a position at the new location and many did not move; in fact, most of the new faculty were previously with the University of Salamanca. For the most part, the curriculum was retained. At the same time, university colleges were created (abolished in the 19th century), a restructuring of the curricula was undertaken and new teachers, both Portuguese and foreign, were admitted. King John III of Portugal made Coimbra the definite home of the university. In the 18th century, the Marquis of Pombal, Minister of the kingdom, made radical reforms in the University, especially regarding the teaching of sciences, in accordance to his Enlightenment and anticlerical creed. During many decades it was the only university in Portugal, since its foundation in 1290 until 1559 (a university in √âvora operated between 1559 and 1759), and again between 1759 and 1911 (University of Lisbon and University of Porto were created in 1911). The long history and past predominance of the University of Coimbra made it an important focus of influence in Portugal, not only educational, but also political and social. Initial steps towards some convergence of European higher education systems were taken with the signature of the Sorbonne declaration by the Ministers in charge of higher education in France, Italy, the United Kingdom and Germany, in 1998, and later, in 1999, with the signature of the Bologna declaration. The Bologna process, aimed at creating a European Higher Education Area by implementing a comparable degree structure, common quality assurance standards and by promoting the mobility of students and faculty members, was a major revolution in Europe's higher education. Globalization, technological change and increased international competition for scarce high-skilled labor highlighted the importance of making European higher education institutions attractive and competitive worldwide. A more integrated European Higher Education Market enhanced competition between European universities‚Äîa necessary condition for producing leading-edge innovations and for catching up with the US economy. In Portugal, the University of Coimbra decided to defer the adoption of the new Bologna Process model from 2006 to 2007/2008 (with exceptions authorized for a few programs on which a national consensus for change had been reached among institutions) in order to make the transition maintaining the highest standards of quality and academic integrity. Only in the 2008/2009 school year did the entire university fully adopt the new programs within its 8 faculties. Organisation Some of the University buildings, September 2019 Its governance is assured by the Rector, the Senate and the University Assembly, the last responsible for the election of the Rector and the Senate. The Rector has the main responsibility for the strategic direction and the overall administration of the university, together with the Senate and assisted by the Administrative Council. The university is divided into eight different faculties (Letters, Law, Medicine, Sciences & Technology, Pharmacy, Economics, Psychology & Education Sciences and Sports Sciences & Physical Education), comprising about 25,000 students. The Faculty of Sciences and Technology (FCTUC) is the largest by number of professors and students, awards the highest number of academic degrees, and manages more classrooms and research units than any other in the UC. Both the National Legal Medicine Institute, an organization under direct supervision of the Portuguese Ministry of the Justice, which provides forensic science services to the police forces and government agencies of Portugal, and the University of Coimbra's teaching hospital, HUC (Hospitais da Universidade de Coimbra), a university hospital known as a centre of research with a broad range of clinical services and medical specialties, are managed by the Faculty of Medicine (FMUC). Joanine Library. The university harbours a huge central library (University of Coimbra General Library), botanical gardens (Botanical Garden of the University of Coimbra), stadiums and other sports facilities (Est√°dio Universit√°rio de Coimbra sports complex and Campo de Santa Cruz stadium), an astronomical observatory, a publishing house, a private chapel (S√£o Miguel Chapel), a theatre (Teatro Acad√©mico de Gil Vicente), and many support facilities such as dining halls and studying rooms. In addition, the university manages several museums and other cultural organizations, including a science museum (Science Museum of the University of Coimbra), a museum of sacred art (Sacred Art Museum of the University of Coimbra), and an academic museum (Academic Museum of the University of Coimbra). A mosaic of the University's seal in front of the main gate. The university has five main campuses or other sites: * P√≥lo I (the monumental ancient university core centre, with the main library and administration services, as well as faculties of law, medicine, letters, psychology, and natural sciences ‚Äì active since the early university times before the 16th century, with major expansions in the 18th century and from the 1940s to the 1960s, during Estado Novo) * P√≥lo II (engineering, sciences & technology ‚Äì built during the 1990s and 2000s) * P√≥lo III (medicine, pharmacy & the university hospital ‚Äì built in the 1980s with major expansions in the 2000s) * Faculdade de Economia (economics, social sciences ‚Äì founded in the 1970s) * Faculdade de Ci√™ncias do Desporto e Educa√ß√£o F√≠sica (sports sciences ‚Äì founded in the late 1990s in the university sports complex) Students The students' union of the university logo Coimbra University, students in robes, for the first week of classes (2019) Students are represented by the students' union Associa√ß√£o Acad√©mica de Coimbra (AAC). Formed on 3 November 1887, it is the oldest university students' union in Portugal, with a long history of struggle against unpopular state policies, forming notable politicians and intellectuals along the way. It also harbours a very dynamic associative life, with its numerous sports and cultural sections, as well as a number of other autonomous organizations. It is an important structure of extracurricular formation of the University of Coimbra's students and a major institution of the city itself. The AAC develops activities such as theatre, cinema, radio and television broadcast, music, choral singing, journalism or philately, as well as rowing, athletics and many other sports. Every student, and occasionally some non-students, are entitled to belong to these sections. Culture, sports and traditions The university's academic traditions and institutions color the life of the city. The old \\"Republics\\" (autonomous students' residences) remain, as well as some traditional festivities, most notably the \\"Queima das Fitas\\" (a celebration of graduation's end, symbolized by the burning of the ribbons with the colors of each of the eight faculties), the \\"Festa das Latas\\" (a homecoming), the frequent use of traditional attire, the \\"Fado de Coimbra\\" (Coimbra's fado, now sung in organized shows rather than the traditional street serenades), and the academic ceremonies (namely the conferring of doctorate degrees). The University's Queima das Fitas Parade. The official colors of the Faculties of the University of Coimbra are: * Faculty of Law: Red * Faculty of Medicine: Yellow * Faculty of Humanities: Dark Blue * Faculty of Sciences & Technology: Light Blue * Faculty of Pharmacy: Purple * Faculty of Economics: Red and White * Faculty of Psychology & Education Sciences: Orange * Faculty of Sports Sciences & Physical Education: Brown These colors are used in the institutional seal and other symbols of each faculty, in the university ceremonies conferring doctorate degrees, and are also used by the students in their ribbons related with the academic traditions (see Queima das Fitas (The Burning of the Ribbons)). The color of the university seal and of the Rector's office, representing the entire institution as a whole, is dark green. The flag of the University of Coimbra (white flag with the dark green seal in the middle) is always erected, over the top of the old university tower, on 1 March, which is the day of the university, being an occasion for a week of debates, conferences, workshops, and special events related with multiple aspects of the institution. S√£o Miguel Chapel. The Praxe is a body of ritual and custom founded upon ancient traditions and it is a controversial part of Coimbra's academic life to which no university student is indifferent. Part of the attraction of Coimbra's academic life, aside from its recognized excellence is that it is more Praxe, having unique rituals that set it apart from other institutions and give its students a special sense of participation in academic rituals that developed hundreds of years ago. Though these rituals are seen as crude and violent by some, they remain an important reference in the academic experience of the students for others. The rules of the Praxe are contained in a book (The Code of Academic Praxe, by a committee of older students of the AAC ‚Äì Associa√ß√£o Acad√©mica de Coimbra), which prescribes appropriate student behavior for activities like drafting, evaluation, groups or bands and the Burning of the Ribbons rituals. Even inside the AAC, Coimbra's student organisation, there are anti-Praxe groups and people who advocate for more thorough reforms in traditional rituals. The Freshman (1st yr.) period (the lowest category in the Praxe hierarchy) is, for many students, a time of good and lasting memories of never to be repeated events. One of the most visible and distinctive traditions is the use of the academic costume of the University of Coimbra, a black suit and cape worn on special occasions by the students, which was adopted by other Portuguese universities and is actually used by students of almost all higher education institutions in the city and across the country. Praxis almost disappeared in the years after the 25 de Abril revolution of 1974. Timidly it was reinstated in the 1980s. However the significance of the traditional academic attire changed substantially. In earlier centuries it was common practice for a student to wear if for the length of his studies. Students occasionally slept in it when consumption of wine frustrated their efforts to reach home. The cape would get to the end of studies, heavily cut by friends and particularly with a deep cut for each girlfriend. Today the academic attire is a ceremonial dress to use in formal students ceremonial. It is also somewhat expensive, and not the practical dress of time past. A student who had been enrolled more than the years of his course was a \\"veteran\\". In the past, when University enrollment was a matter of social class, some students would accumulate quite a number of enrollments. The individual who had the most was Dux Veteranorum, a notable figure in the student scene at the University. In the middle 1980s for instance, the Dux Veteranorum had more than 20 enrollments in Law School but had graduated in only 2 or 3 courses. This tradition is disappearing as the University is putting constraints in the number of years a student can enroll. Most student costs are supported with public money and it is no longer found acceptable that some individuals burden finances to extend their stays without graduating. However, with the increasing tuition fees a student has to pay to attend the university and the attraction of new types of mature students (almost always as part-time or evening class students) like employees, businessmen, parents, and pensioners, many departments make a substantial profit from every additional student enrolled in courses, with benefits for the university's gross tuition revenue and without loss of educational quality (teacher per student, computer per student, classroom size per student, etc.). The University's Palace Gate. The sports sections of the AAC play a significant role in Coimbra's sport life, often being the city's main representative in that area. They include rugby, handball, basketball, baseball, martial arts, athletics, gymnastic or swimming, among others. Just as with the cultural sections, every student, including professional or semi- professional athletes, may belong to them. The city's main football club, usually known as \\"Acad√©mica\\" or \\"Briosa\\", is in formal terms an autonomous organism of the AAC and is called AAC-OAF, but in practical terms it is an independent club, only loosely connected to its mother institution. It is a relatively important team, especially as regards to its huge number of followers nationwide, and plays in the top Portuguese football leagues, having been the first winner in history of the Portuguese Football Cup, in 1939. Recep√ß√£o ao Caloiro In Portugal, the homecoming is known as Recep√ß√£o ao Caloiro (The Freshman's Reception). It includes numerous events and traditions born in the 19th century in the University of Coimbra. It is defined as a welcome to the new students, the freshmen (caloiros), and takes place at the beginning of the academic year in Portuguese university towns. In every classic public university of Portugal the homecoming is celebrated yearly. The events are followed in varying degrees by other less traditional or smaller institutions. A street parade of students, concerts, and sports events are always organized for the freshmen's reception. The street parade organized in several major Portuguese universities is known as Latada, and its name comes from the tradition of tying tin cans to the freshmen's legs (the word lata is tin can in Portuguese). Festa das Latas from \\"Manual do Caloiro\\" (The freshman's handbook) of the Associa√ß√£o Acad√©mica de Coimbra, website of the IX Congresso Ib√©rico de Parasitologia (9th Iberian Congress of Parasitology) of the Faculty of Farmacy of the University of Coimbra =History= \\"The Freshman's Reception\\" (Recep√ß√£o ao Caloiro, the Portuguese name for university homecoming) goes back to the 19th century when the law students of the University of Coimbra felt the need to express their joy at finishing the school year in as loud a way as possible, using everything at their disposal that would make noise, namely tin cans, which is the original root of \\"The Tin Can Parade\\". =Coimbra= The University's Grand Examination Room. In Coimbra, where the oldest Portuguese university was founded in the Middle Ages, the Recep√ß√£o ao Caloiro (The Freshman's Reception) week, includes the Festa das Latas (The Tin Can Festival). The Tin Can Festival's name comes from the tradition of tying tin cans to the freshmen's legs for the parade (The Tin Can Parade) which is known as Latada. The events are organized by the students' union of the University of Coimbra, the Associa√ß√£o Acad√©mica de Coimbra, and takes place during the fall. It is an important part of the praxe acad√©mica (student praxis) in Coimbra, followed by the city population as an ancient cultural manifestation and local tradition, and has become a tourist attraction for a number of visitors every year. Events A statue of King Jo√£o III, who based the University permanently in Coimbra. The highlight of this homecoming, which now takes place at the beginning of the academic year (October/November) is the special parade known as the Latada. After marching through the streets of the city the new students are baptized in the Mondego River thus entering into the Coimbra academic fraternity. The second- year students are awarded their Grelos (a small ribbon). The Grelo is a small, woollen ribbon with the color(s) of the student's faculty, that is attached to a student's briefcase. Before this, the students must have visited the Dom Pedro V market during the morning, where they must get a turnip to sustain the Caloiros during the day's festivities. Besides the tin cans they have tied to their legs, the new students wear all kinds of costumes made up according to the creativity and imagination of their godmothers or godfathers, who are older students. They also carry placards with ironic criticisms alluding to certain teachers, the educational system, national events and leaders. The homecoming includes the \\"Tin Can Festival\\" week, with concerts and several other cultural events and sports activities beyond the parade, which always happens on a Tuesday. These include the historical night-time student fado serenade which happens in the stairs of the Old Cathedral of Coimbra to a crowd of thousands of students and other spectators, every year during the celebrations. Queima das Fitas One of the main squares Coimbra's Queima das Fitas (Burning of the Ribbons), the oldest and most famous in the country, is organized by a students' commission formed by members of the students' union of the University of Coimbra, the Associa√ß√£o Acad√©mica de Coimbra. Celebrating the end of graduation courses, symbolized by the ritual burning of the ribbons representing each faculty, it takes place at the second semester (first weekend of May), being among the biggest student festivities in Europe. It lasts for 8 days, one for each Faculty: Letters, Law, Medicine, Sciences & Technology, Pharmacy, Economics, Psychology & Education Sciences and Sports Sciences & Physical Education. During this period, a series of concerts and performances are held, turning Coimbra in a lively and vibrant city. Students Lore Stories passed along over generations of students, the University folklore is plentiful. One student usually asked his father for money, stating \\"Rent 20, Food 30\\". One day he asked \\"Rent 20, Food 30, Hammering 20, Fixing of the hammer and medication 40.\\" Another student had oral examinations at Law School. Unresponsive to the simplest of questions, the professor already impatient, turned to the bailiff and asked \\"Bring in a stack of hay\\" to which the student very quickly added \\"And I'll have a glass of water please.\\" The University's Joanine Library, founded in 1717 The years of dictatorship were gruesome. Apart from the students that got 7 years in prison for toasting to freedom which led directly to the foundation of Amnesty International in 1961, in 1968 students would spend the whole night greasing streets and sidewalks with soap so the mounted police would have a hard time chasing them down to break a demonstration. It is said that a student dared a policeman to get his shoes and feet wet chasing after a cigarette lighter, thrown in the duck pond, while he had the license for it in his pocket. In those days one needed a permit to own a cigarette lighter, as imposed by Salazar to protect the matches industry. Other items are plain local knowledge: * \\"Black it is, Chicken made it\\" (a pun on a children's charade, \\"White it is, chicken hatched it\\", to which the answer is \\"the egg\\")‚Äîit happens that the gates of the Botanical Garden are black, and were made by a person named Chicken (Galinha). * Bet you can't climb the Monumental Stairs, two steps at a time, as there are 125 steps in 5 installments of 25 steps each. Freshmen on first day of classes may have rough stuff to go through. In the escalator of the Mathematics Department it is common to see them buying season tickets to take the ride all year round, and at least once, as urban myth has it, a poster announcing \\"Flight Insurance For This Elevator, At Sale in The Lobby\\", was inquired about by the newcomers. Business incubator and science park The Instituto Pedro Nunes (IPN), founded by the University of Coimbra, is a business incubator and an innovation and technology transfer center of the university, working for the business and applied research communities. The Coimbra iParque is a science park which has among its several founders and associates the University of Coimbra. Notable startup companies born from the University of Coimbra include ISA, Critical Software, Crioestaminal, Ciberbit and Feedzai . Academics Reputation University of Coimbra's reputation in teaching and research is testified by independent external rankings and reports. According to The Times Higher Education Supplement (2007 QS World University Rankings, by QS ‚Äì Quacquarelli Symonds), the University of Coimbra is ranked number 3 among the universities in the Portuguese-speaking countries (behind the University of S√£o Paulo and the University of Campinas), and ranked 318 in the overall world rank. It was ranked number one among the universities of the Portuguese-speaking countries in 2006.Information for international students and researchers, University of Coimbra It is now ranked number one in Portugal, number 3 among the universities in the Portuguese-speaking countries, and number 394 in the world (234 in Natural Sciences, 260 in Engineering & IT, 282 in Social Sciences, 290 in Arts & Humanities, 325 in Life Sciences).QS World University Rankings 2011/12 In addition, it has students from 70 different nationalities; almost 10% of its students are foreigners, being among Portugal's most international universities. Allegorical figures of the University. The University of Coimbra is among the major science and technology hubs for applied and fundamental research in Portugal. One of the most powerful supercomputers in Portugal belongs to the University of Coimbra and is managed by the Laboratory for Advanced Computing of the Department of Physics at the University of Coimbra.Laborat√≥rio de Computa√ß√£o Avan√ßada Built in the mid 2000s, the supercomputer was called Milipeia, using 528 processors and 1000 GB of memory. Its capacity has been expanded since then. The main tasks of the university's supercomputer include modeling and calculus in molecular biology, genetics, particle physics, astrophysics, mathematics, engineering, geophysics, condensed matter physics, etc. Besides University of Coimbra's researchers, other Portuguese scientific community members are allowed to work with Milipeia. Coimbra: Super computador ¬´Milipeia¬ª dispon√≠vel em Dezembro , in Di√°rio Digital (24 October 2006) Organisation and length of courses Courtyard of the old Faculty of Pharmacy School year calendar starts in October and finishes in July. In 2004, it was among the first universities in Portugal limiting the time for degree completion. The degree programmes have a specified minimum and maximum time for completion. The time limit is 6 years from the date of first enrolment for the 4 years degrees, and 8 years from the date of first enrolment for 6 years degrees (i.e. Medicine). After that, students have to pay the entire costs of their courses. The tuition fee for undergraduate degrees was ‚Ç¨356/year in 2002/2003. It was increased to ‚Ç¨880/year in 2004/2005 and to ‚Ç¨901,23/year in 2005/2006, the maximum fee allowed to state universities by law. Even with the time limit and the increased tuition fees, the university has had a high number of applicants every year. Like other universities in Portugal, and unlike the polytechnical institutes and many private universities, the university does not have special classes for workers or night classes. Overcrowded classrooms have been frequent in some disciplines at the Faculties of Science and Technology, Law, and Economics. In those occasions, students may stand during the classes or even stay outside the classroom. These faculties have the highest abandon rate and the biggest average time for degree completion. New buildings, campus expansion and modernized infrastructures since the late 1990s and the 2000s, have solved almost all these problems. Admission University's botanical garden Admission is strictly merit-based, and the university has several departments which are known for higher-than-average selectiveness. Numerus clausus is applied to select among competing applicants. To programmes such as medicine, pharmacy, biomedical engineering, and architecture, admission is an extraordinarily difficult process, and demand a minimum grade point average from high school plus the entrance exams, that usually ranges from 170 to 200 (out of 200). Acceptance rates may vary significantly from faculty to faculty or from department to department. Foreign applicants usually make up more than 10 percent of the applicant pool, and are considered individually by the merits achieved in their respective state of origin or through bilateral protocols between the governments of Portugal and foreign governments. There are also a number of other extraordinary admission processes for older people (admission for candidates older than 23 years old), sportsmen, degree owners from other institutions, students from other institutions (academic transfer), former students (readmission), etc., which are subject to specific standards and regulations set by each department or faculty. Notable alumni and students Many Portuguese historical figures and renowned personalities noted for their activity in fields ranging from politics to culture to the sciences, attended the University of Coimbra as students or lecturers. The long list of personalities includes Lu√≠s Vaz de Cam√µes, considered Portugal's greatest poet, the only Portuguese Nobel Prize in Medicine Egas Moniz, Portuguese dictator Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar who was the founder and leader of the regime that presided over the last period of the Portuguese Empire from 1933 to 1974, Aristides de Sousa Mendes, consul-general in Bordeaux, who in June 1940 defied Salazar‚Äôs regime to issue tens of thousands of visas to fleeing Jewish and other refugees, subsequently stripped of his position and 12 years after his death recognized by Israel as one of the Righteous Among the Nations, the first diplomat honored, or famous 16th century mathematicians like Pedro Nunes, who is considered one of the greatest Portuguese mathematicians ever, and the German Christopher Clavius, who was the main architect of the modern Gregorian calendar.

Canaro was born in San Jos√© de Mayo, Uruguay, in 1888. His parents were Italian immigrants, and later, when he was less than 10 years old, they emigrated to Buenos Aires, Argentina in the late nineteenth century. As a young man he found work in a factory, where an empty oil can, in his skilled hands, became his first violin. Performing in seedy bars initially, he ultimately forged a career that spanned many decades, and his orchestra was one of the most recorded. His introduction to the tango came by orquesta t√≠pica leader Vicente Greco in 1908, and in 1912 he composed \\"Pinta brava\\" (\\"Fierce Look\\"). Canaro composed the music for the 1915 Argentine classic film Nobleza gaucha. He later was romantically attached to Argentine actress and tango vocalist Ada Falc√≥n, but the relationship, which began in the early 1920s, grew apart a decade later. Canaro and his orchestra, c.1930. In 1920 Canaro discovered Azucena Maizani, who rapidly developed into a major tango star.Karush p.102 Canaro was active in the cause of intellectual property rights from 1918 onwards, and was instrumental in the establishment of the Argentine Society of Composers and Songwriters (SADAIC), in 1935, purchasing the downtown Buenos Aires lot where its headquarters were built. He performed in Paris with his orchestra in 1925, and a success among local audiences, he remained in Europe for a decade. Becoming a naturalized Argentine citizen in 1940, much of his recorded music is in the classic salon style of that decade, but he is also considered a member of the old guard, and some of his later recordings contributed to the transition to concert tango. Canaro's orchestra became a fixture on Argentine radio during the 1940s and early 1950s, though for many contemporary dancers and listeners, his early golden age recordings remained the best in their genre. Canaro authored his memoirs, Mis 50 a√±os con el tango (My Fifty Years with the Tango) in 1956, but later developed Paget's disease, and was forced to retire. He died in Buenos Aires in 1964.

Founding of the town during Ostsiedlung  Probably in the second half of the 13th century the town was founded near Wo≈Çowo and partially on the soil of the second village.Weczerka, p.570 Wo≈Ç√≥w received Magdeburg town rights about 1285 at the time of German Ostsiedlung in the region; a Vogt is mentioned in 1288. At that time Wo≈Ç√≥w belonged to the Duchy of G≈Çog√≥w, after 1312 to the Duchy of Ole≈õnica. With the duchy it came under the suzerainty of Bohemia in 1328. From 1473 dates the oldest known seal of the town, which already shows an ox, as do all later seals. Wo≈Ç√≥w was ruled by local Polish dukes until 1492, and soon after, in 1495, it came into the possession of the Czech Podiebrad family, then in 1517 it came into the hands the Hungarian magnate Johann Thurz√≥, before returning to Piast rule in 1523, by passing to the Duchy of Legnica. It remained there until the Piast dukes of Legnica-Brzeg-Wo≈Ç√≥w died out in 1675. As a result of the Thirty Years' War, the town's population fell by half. Wo≈Ç√≥w (as Wohlau) around 1750 The Protestant Reformation was introduced to the town in 1522 by duke Frederick II. After the extinction of the local Piasts the duchy passed to the House of Habsburg, which opposed the Protestant denomination in the town, as part of the Counter-Reformation. In 1682 the town's parish church was closed and given to the Catholics. According to the Treaty of Altranst√§dt the church however was already returned to the Protestants in 1707 and stayed Protestant until 1945. The small Catholic minority in return received a Josephinian curacy.Weczerka, p.571 In 1742 Wo≈Ç√≥w was annexed by Prussia. The duchy was divided into two districts and the town became county seat of one of the districts. The structure of the town was, until 1700, defined by craft, especially clothiers. As the seat of a duchy and a district administrative function however became more and more important. The industrialization played only a minor role and mostly affected smaller companies of the timber industry. In 1781 the city suffered a fire. The town was part of Germany from 1871 to 1945. In January 1945 - just before town was taken by the Red Army - the Wehrmacht evacuated the German population westwards. After Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II, the town became part of Poland. The totality of the town's previous population was expelled. In 1962, the town was site of the Wo≈Ç√≥w bank robbery, one of the largest bank robberies in Poland.

Troilo was a bandoneon player, composer, arranger, and bandleader in Argentina. His orquesta t√≠pica was among the most popular with social dancers during the golden age of tango (1940-1955), but he changed to a concert sound by the late 1950s. Troilo's orchestra is best known for its instrumentals, though he also recorded with many well-known vocalists such as Roberto Goyeneche, Edmundo Rivero and . His rhythmic instrumentals and the recordings he made with vocalist Francisco Fiorentino from 1941 to 1943, known as milongas, were some of the favourites in tango salons. The renowned bandoneonist Astor Piazzolla played in and arranged for Troilo's orquesta t√≠pica during the period of 1939‚Äì1944.  Biography  An√≠bal Troilo was born on July 11, 1914, to Felisa Bagnoli and An√≠bal Troilo, in the well-known barrio of Abasto. His father nicknamed him \\"Pichuco\\", an alteration of the Neapolitan \\"picciuso\\", meaning \\"weepy\\", or \\"crybaby\\". He had one brother and one sister. During his childhood, Troilo listened to the bandoneon in the bars of his neighbourhood. At the age of 10, he convinced his mother to buy him his first bandoneon. Troilo kept the instrument and played it for the rest of his life. When he was 11, in 1925, Pichuco played his first performance in a bar. At the age of 14, he formed his first quintet. He studied until his third year of high school at Escuela Superior de Comercio Carlos Pellegrini, one of the most prestigious high schools in Argentina and the whole of Latin America. In December 1930, Troilo was hired to be part of the famous Vardaro-Pugliese sextet of violinist Elvino Vardaro, pianist Osvaldo Pugliese, violinist Alfredo Gobbi, bandoneon player Miguel Jurado (later replaced by Ciriaco Ortiz), and double bass player Luis Addesso. Following this, Troilo played in numerous orchestras, including those of Juan \\"Pacho\\" Maglio, Julio de Caro, Juan d'Arienzo, Angel D'Agostino, and Juan Carlos Cobi√°n. With his own orchestra, (whose members varied greatly), he played almost continuously, both live and in the studio, until 1975, the year of his death. From 1953 until the mid-60s, Troilo also played with guitarist Roberto Grela as a duo, which later became the Troilo-Grela Quartet. In 1968, having distanced himself from Grela, he formed his own ensemble, the An√≠bal Troilo Quartet, which additionally consisted of Ubaldo de L√≠o on electric guitar, Osvaldo Berlingieri on piano, and Rafael del Bagno on double bass. Berlingieri was later replaced by Jos√© Col√°ngelo, who also played in the An√≠bal Troilo Orchestra during its final years. In addition to this, Troilo recorded two songs (\\"El motivo\\" and \\"Volver\\") as a bandoneon duo with Astor Piazzolla. An√≠bal Troilo (in the centre, with bandoneon). From left to right: Osvaldo Fresedo, Jos√© Razzano, Francisco Canaro and Enrique Santos Disc√©polo, in 1944. The death of Troilo's best friend, the poet Homero Manzi (1907-1951), caused him to go into a deep depression that lasted for more than a year. In the poet's memory, he composed the tango Responso. The \\"Supreme Bandone√≥n of Buenos Aires\\" died on May 18, 1975, at the Italian Hospital of Buenos Aires, from a stroke and subsequent cardiac arrest; he is buried in the \\"Rinc√≥n de los Notables\\" (Famous corner) of the La Chacarita cemetery, next to Agust√≠n Magaldi and Roberto Goyeneche.  Bandone√≥n Day  In 2005, the National Congress of Argentina declared July 11 (Troilo's birthday) National Bandone√≥n Day, to commemorate one of the nation's most celebrated musicians.

The Aeiparthenos (Ever Virgin) title is widely used in Eastern Orthodox liturgy, and icons show her with three stars, on shoulders and forehead, symbolising her threefold virginity. The perpetual virginity of Mary is the doctrine that Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ, was a virgin ante partum, in partu, et post partum - before, during and after the birth of Christ. It is one of the four Marian dogmas of the Catholic Church, and is held also by the Eastern Orthodox Churches in Eastern Christianity and by some Lutherans and Anglicans in Western Christianity. There is no biblical basis for Mary's perpetual virginity. The belief arose at the end of the 2nd century in ascetic circles who believed that sex and marriage were symptoms of original sin, and was affirmed as orthodoxy during the 4th century debates between supporters of virginity on the one hand and Christian marriage on the other. Those debates centred on the question of whether scripture did or did not indicate that Mary had other children, for the Pauline epistles, the four canonical gospels, and the Acts of the Apostles, all mention the brothers (adelphoi) of Jesus; the scriptural evidence is not absolutely conclusive, but Thomas Aquinas said that although reason could not prove Mary's perpetual virginity it must be accepted because it was \\"fitting\\" that Jesus as the only-begotten son of God should also be the only-begotten son of Mary. The doctrine was established at the Council of Ephesus in 431 and the Lateran Council of 649 emphasised its threefold character before, during, and after the birth of Christ, but the lack of scriptural support led to it being largely abandoned by most Protestants following the Reformation.  Doctrine  Image of Mary depicting her nursing the Infant Jesus. 3rd century, Catacomb of Priscilla, Rome. The perpetual virginity of Mary is one of the four Marian dogmas of the Catholic Church, meaning that it is held to be a truth divinely revealed, the denial of which is heresy. (The other three are her role as Theotokos (meaning mother of God), her Immaculate Conception, and her bodily assumption into heaven). It declares her virginity before, during and after the birth of Jesus, or in the definition formulated by Pope Martin I at the Lateran Council of 649: > The blessed ever-virginal and immaculate Mary conceived, without seed, by > the Holy Spirit, and without loss of integrity brought him forth, and after > his birth preserved her virginity inviolate. Western Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches both recognise Mary as Aeiparthenos, meaning \\"ever-virgin\\". Thomas Aquinas said that reason could not prove this, but that it must be accepted because it was \\"fitting\\", for as Jesus was the only-begotten son of God, so he should also be the only-begotten son of Mary, as a second and purely human conception would disrespect the sacred state of her holy womb. The 2nd century Gospel of James has a similar message, describing how the hand of the midwife who attempted to test the holy mother's integrity by inserting her finger into Mary's vagina burst into flames and withered. The church teaches that her virginity before the birth is revealed by scripture and affirmed in the Apostles' Creed, which states that Jesus was \\"conceived of the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary\\"; Pope Martin's definition of her virginity at the moment of birth means that this caused no physical injury to her virginal seal, which is both symbol and part of her perfect virginity of body and soul; while the final aspect affirms that Mary continued as a virgin to the end of her Earthly life, having no physical relations with her husband nor bearing any further children. Symbolically, the perpetual virginity of Mary signifies a new creation and a fresh start in salvation history. It has been stated and argued repeatedly, most recently by the Second Vatican Council: > This union of the mother with the Son in the work of salvation is made > manifest from the time of Christ's virginal conception ‚Ä¶ then also at the > birth of Our Lord, who did not diminish his mother's virginal integrity but > sanctified it... (Lumen Gentium, No.57)  History  The midwife tests Mary's virginity following the birth of Christ, as recounted in the Gospel of James  Origins: 2nd century The exact origin of the tradition of Mary's perpetual virginity is unknown; her ante-partum virginity is attested in the Gospel of Matthew and in the Gospel of Luke, but there is no biblical basis for her virginity during and after the birth. Mary's virginity, pre or post natal, seems to have attracted little theological attention prior to the end of the 2nd century, Ignatius of Antioch (c.35-108), for example, discussing it only to argue for the reality of Jesus's human birth against the docetic heretics who denied him any humanity. The idea of Mary's perpetual virginity first appears in a late 2nd century text called the Gospel of James (or Protoevangelium of James), \\"the ultimate source of almost all later Marian doctrine.\\" In this story Mary remains a life-long virgin, Joseph is an old man who marries her without physical desire, and the brothers of Jesus are explained as Joseph's sons by an earlier marriage. The birth takes place in a cave near Bethlehem, and the new-born Jesus simply appears from a cloud and a blinding light and takes his mother's breast; two midwives are present outside the cave, one unnamed who believes, the other, Salome, who demands to touch the physical organs of the holy mother: > The midwife came out of the cave [in which the birth took place], and Salome > met her. And she said to her: \\"Salome, Salome, I have I have a new sight to > tell you; a virgin has brought forth, a thing which her nature does not > allow.\\" And Salome said: \\"As the Lord my God lives, unless I put (forward) > my finger and test her condition, I will not believe that a virgin has > brought forth.\\" And Salome went in and made ready to test her condition. And > she cried out saying: \\"I have tempted the living God...\\" (The > Protoevangelium of Gospel of James, 19:3-20, quoted in Brown, 1978). Salome's hand withers, but she prays to God for forgiveness and an angel appears and tells her to touch the Christ-child again, whereupon her hand is restored; the episode performs the same function as \\"doubting Thomas\\" in the Gospel of John. James possibly derives from a sect called the Encratites, whose founder Tatian taught that sex and marriage were symptoms of original sin; its context was the growth of asceticism with its emphasis on celibacy, the monks seeing all sexual activity as tainted by sin. It was widely distributed and seems to have formed the basis of the stories of Mary in the Quran.  3rd-4th century establishment of orthodoxy  By the early 4th century the spread of monasticism had promoted celibacy as the ideal Christian state, and a moral hierarchy was established with marriage occupying the third rank below life-long virginity and widowhood. Around 380 Helvidius objected to the devaluation of marriage inherent in this view and argued that the two states, of virginity and marriage, were equal; but his contemporary Jerome, realising that this would lead to the Mother of God occupying a place in heaven lower than virgins and widows, defended her perpetual virginity in his immensely influential Against Helvidius, issued c.383. Helvidius soon faded from the scene, but in the early 380s the monk Jovinian wrote that if Jesus did not undergo a normal human birth then he himself was not human, which was the teaching of the heresy known as Manichaeism. Jerome wrote against Jovinian but failed to mention this aspect of his teaching, and most commentators believe that he did not find it offensive. The only important Christian intellectual to defend Mary's virginity in partu was Ambrose, Archbishop of Milan, who was the chief target of the charge of Manicheism. For Ambrose, both the physical birth of Jesus by Mary and the baptismal birthing of Christians by the Church had to be totally virginal, even in partu, in order to cancel the stain of original sin, of which the pains of labor are the physical sign. It was due to Ambrose that virginitas in partu came to be included consistently in the thinking of subsequent theologians. Jovinian's view was rejected at a Synod of Milan held under Ambrose's presidency in 390, after which Mary's perpetual virginity was established as the only orthodox view. The Council of Ephesus in 431 established a full general consensus on the subject, in 553 the Second Council of Constantinople gave her the title Aeiparthenons, meaning Perpetual Virgin, and at the Lateran Council of 649 Pope Martin I emphasised its threefold character, before, during, and after the birth of Christ.  Protestant Reformation  The Protestant Reformation rejected the sanctity of virginity, and as a result marriage and parenthood were extolled, Mary and Joseph were seen as a normal married couple, and sexual abstinence was no longer regarded as a virtue. It also brought the idea of the Bible as the fundamental source of authority regarding God's word (sola scriptura), and the reformers noted that while holy scripture explicitly required belief in the virgin birth, it only permitted acceptance of perpetual virginity. But despite the lack of a clear biblical basis for the doctrine, it was supported by Martin Luther (who included it in the Smalcald Articles, a Lutheran confession of faith written in 1537) as well as by Huldrych Zwingli, John Calvin, and later John Wesley, the co-founder of Methodism. This was because these moderate reformers were under pressure from others more radical than themselves who held Jesus to have been no more than a prophet: Mary's perpetual virginity thus became a guarantee of the Incarnation, despite its shaky scriptural foundations. Notwithstanding this early acceptance by the reformers, modern Protestants, apart from some Lutherans and Anglo-Catholics, have largely rejected the perpetual virginity and it has rarely appeared explicitly in confessions or doctrinal statements.  Arguments and evidence  The Church Fathers in an 11th-century depiction from Kyiv The New Testament explicitly affirms Mary's virginity only prior to the conception of Jesus. The problem facing theologians wishing to maintain her perpetual virginity is that the Pauline epistles, the four canonical gospels, and the Acts of the Apostles, all mention the brothers (adelphoi) of Jesus, with Mark and Matthew recording their names and Mark adding unnamed sisters. names James, Joses, Judas, Simon; has Joseph for Joses, the latter being an abbreviated form of the former, and reverses the order of the last two; Mark 6:3 and refer to unnamed sisters; Luke, John and Acts all mention brothers also. See Bauckham (2015) in bibliography, pages 6-9. The Gospel of James resolved the problem by turning the adelphoi into Joseph's children by an earlier marriage; this is still the view of the Orthodox Christian churches, but Jerome, believing that Joseph, like Mary, must have been a life-long virgin, said that they were the sons of a different Mary entirely, a kinswoman of the Virgin - a modern variation is that the second Mary, mentioned in as the wife of Clopas, was not a kinswoman of Mary's but that Clopas was Joseph's brother. Further scriptural difficulties were added by , which calls Jesus the \\"first-born\\" son of Mary, and Matthew 1:25, which adds that Joseph did not \\"know\\" (have sex with) his wife \\"until she had brought forth her firstborn son.\\" Helvidius argued that first-born implies later births, and that the word \\"until\\" left open the way to sexual relations after the birth; Jerome, replying that even an only son will be a first-born, and that \\"until\\" did not have the meaning Helvidius construed for it, painted a repulsive word-portrait of Joseph having intercourse with a blood-stained and exhausted Mary immediately after she has given birth - the implication, in his view, of Helvidius's arguments. Opinions on the quality of Jerome's rebuttal range from the view that it was masterful and well-argued to thin, rhetorical and sometimes tasteless. Two other 4th century Fathers, Gregory of Nyssa and Augustine, advanced a further argument by reading as a vow of perpetual virginity on Mary's part; the idea, first introduced in the Gospel of James, has little scholarly support today. Nevertheless, this argument, and those advanced by Jerome and Ambrose, were put forward by Pope John Paul II in his catechesis of August 28, 1996, as the four facts supporting the Church's ongoing faith in Mary's perpetual virginity: > ...[T]here are no reasons for thinking that the will to remain a virgin, > which Mary expressed at the moment of the Annunciation (cf. Luke 1:34) was > then changed. Moreover, the immediate meaning of the words \\"Woman, behold > your son!\\" \\"Behold your mother\\" (John 19:26), which Jesus addressed from the > Cross to Mary and his favorite disciple, imply that Mary had no other > children. ...[T]he word \\"firstborn\\" literally means \\"a child not preceded by > another\\", and, in itself, makes no reference to the existence of other > children. ...The phrase \\"brothers of Jesus\\" indicates \\"the children\\" of a > Mary who was a disciple of Christ (cf.

In their view, this would bypass nation-states, corporate oligopolies, ideological NGOs, cults and mafias. One of its most prolific proponents is the British political thinker David Held. In the last decade, Held published a dozen books regarding the spread of democracy from territorially defined nation states to a system of global governance that encapsulates the entire world. For some, democratic mundialisation (from the French term mundialisation) is a variant of democratic globalisation stressing the need for the direct election of world leaders and members of global institutions by citizens worldwide; for others, it is just another name for democratic globalisation. These proponents state that democratic globalisation's purpose is to: * Expand globalisation and make people closer and more united. This expansion should differ from economic globalization and \\"make people closer, more united and protected\\" because of a variety of opinions and proposals it is still unclear what this would mean in practice and how it could be realized. * Have it reach all fields of activity and knowledge, including governmental and economic, since the economic one is crucial to develop the well-being of world citizens. * Give world citizens democratic access and a say in those global activities. For example, presidential voting for United Nations Secretary-General by citizens and direct election of members of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly. Supporters of the democratic globalization movement draw a distinction between their movement and the one most popularly known as the anti-globalization movement, claiming that their movement avoids ideological agenda about economics and social matters. Democratic globalization supporters state that the choice of political orientations should be left to the world citizens via their participation in world democratic institutions. Some proponents in the anti-globalization movement do not necessarily disagree with this position. For example, George Monbiot, normally associated with the anti-globalization movement (who prefers the term global justice movement), has proposed in his work Age of Consent similar democratic reforms of most major global institutions, suggesting direct democratic elections of such bodies and a form of world government.  Background  Democratic globalization supports the extension of political democratization to economic and financial globalization. It is based upon an idea that free international transactions benefit the global society as a whole. They believe in financially open economies, where the government and central bank must be transparent in order to retain the confidence of the markets, since transparency spells doom for autocratic regimes. They promote democracy that makes leaders more accountable to the citizenry through the removal of restrictions on such transactions.  Social movements  The democratic globalization movement started to get public attention when New York Times reported its demonstration to contest a World Trade Organization (WTO) in Seattle, Washington, November 1999. This gathering was to criticize unfair trade and undemocratic globalization of the WTO, World Bank, World Economic Forum (WEF), the International Monetary Fund. Its primary tactics were public rallies, street theater and civil disobedience. Democratic globalization, proponents claim, would be reached by creating democratic global institutions and changing international organizations (which are currently intergovernmental institutions controlled by the nation-states), into global ones controlled by world citizens. The movement suggests to do it gradually by building a limited number of democratic global institutions in charge of a few crucial fields of common interest. Its long-term goal is that these institutions federate later into a full-fledged democratic world government. Global democracy Thus, it supports the International Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, that would allow for participation of member nations' legislators and, eventually, direct election of United Nations (UN) parliament members by citizens worldwide. Difference to anti-globalization Some supporters of the democratic globalization movement draw a distinction between their movement and the one most popularly known as the 'anti-globalization' movement, claiming that their movement avoids ideological agenda about economics and social matters although, in practice, it is often difficult to distinguish between the two camps. Democratic globalization supporters state that the choice of political orientations should be left to the world citizens, via their participation in world democratic institutions and direct vote for world presidents (see presidentialism). Some supporters of the \\"anti- globalization movement\\" do not necessarily disagree with this position. For example, George Monbiot, normally associated with the anti-globalization movement (who prefers the term Global Justice Movement) in his work Age of Consent has proposed similar democratic reforms of most major global institutions, suggesting direct democratic elections of such bodies by citizens, and suggests a form of \\"federal world government\\".

Its long- term goal is that these institutions federate later into a full-fledged democratic world government.

It is the first film in the Sleepaway Camp franchise, and tells the story of a young girl sent to a summer camp that becomes the site of a series of murders shortly after her arrival. It stars Felissa Rose, Katherine Kamhi, Paul DeAngelo, and Mike Kellin in his last screen appearance. Released during the genre's heyday, the film is known for its infamous twist ending. Since its release, it has become a cult film. It was followed by three sequels, Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers (1988), Sleepaway Camp III: Teenage Wasteland (1989), and Return to Sleepaway Camp (2008). Plot In 1975, John Baker and his partner Lenny take John's children Angela and Peter on a boating trip near Camp Arawak. Angela and Peter prank their father by capsizing their boat. They attempt to swim ashore where Lenny is waiting for them, but camp counselor Mary Anna recklessly strikes John and one of his children with her speedboat, killing them both. Eight years later, Angela now lives with her eccentric aunt, Dr. Martha Thomas, and Martha's son Ricky. Aunt Martha sends Angela to Camp Arawak for the first time, along with Ricky, who had attended the camp before. Angela's introverted nature makes her a target for ridicule and bullying, mostly from her bunkmate Judy and their counselor Meg. Angela's other counselor Susie and the camp's head counselor Ronnie do what they can to help. The cook, Artie, attempts to molest Angela, but Ricky catches him, and Ricky and Angela run out. Later, an unseen figure causes Artie to knock over a pot of boiling water and scald himself. Camp owner Mel Costic calls it an accident. When campers Kenny and Mike mock Angela, Ricky and his friend Paul fight them. Paul befriends Angela. When Kenny drowns, his death is ruled accidental at Mel's insistence, although Ronnie and police officer Frank express doubt. Paul asks Angela to attend a film with him. After campers Billy and Mike throw water balloons at Angela, Billy is stung to death when someone traps him in a bathroom stall and drops a hive in it. Mel suspects a killer is in the camp. Angela and Paul's relationship is strained when Paul kisses her. Angela has a flashback to when she and her sibling witnessed their father in bed with Lenny. Angela recoils from Paul's advances and runs away. Judy seduces Paul, and Angela finds them kissing. Paul attempts to explain himself to Angela at the lake but Judy and Meg shoo him away and throw Angela into the water. After Ricky rescues Angela, children fling sand at them. Ricky comforts Angela and swears revenge on her aggressors. Meg is stabbed to death in the shower while getting ready to meet Mel. At the camp social, Paul apologizes to Angela and she asks him to meet her at the waterfront later. Mel finds Meg's body and is convinced that Ricky is the killer. The children who threw sand at Angela and Ricky are camping in the woods with their counselor Eddie when two of them ask him to take them back to the main camp. He returns to find the four remaining children hacked to death with his hatchet. Back at the camp, the killer enters Judy's cabin and murders her, raping her with a hot curling iron while smothering her with a pillow. The camp is thrown into a panic. Thinking Ricky is the killer, Mel beats him mercilessly, only to be shot in the throat with an arrow by the real killer. Frank is called and searches with the counselors for the missing campers. Paul is at the beach with Angela, who suggests they go skinny dipping. Frank discovers Ricky unconscious but alive. Ronnie and Susie find Angela sitting on the beach and humming, with Paul, whose head appears to be resting on her lap as she strokes his hair. A flashback shows Aunt Martha welcoming the survivor of the boat accident into her home. It is revealed that the real Angela is the child who died in the accident, while Aunt Martha took custody of the surviving Peter, reasoning that since she already has a son and always wanted a little girl, that she should raise Peter as Angela instead. Back in the present, \\"Angela\\" leaps to their feet holding a hunting knife, allowing Paul's severed head to fall on the ground. Shocked, Ronnie exclaims, \\"How can it be?

In interviews, screenwriter and director, Robert Hiltzik, has said that he attended that camp as a child. The movie was filmed in 5 weeks starting in September 1982 and ending in October of that year on a budget of $350,000. The film had been storyboarded but after the first day of filming, the movie was already behind schedule. So, the storyboards could not be used and were thrown out. The trees, with their leaves turning, belie the summer setting of the movie. Unlike many of its contemporaries, which had adults portraying youth, the cast of Sleepaway Camp was primarily made up of adolescent actors. Release Sleepaway Camp had a limited regional release on November 18, 1983. According to the American Film Institute, it had its premiere in Los Angeles the following spring on May 25, 1984. The August 1984 Box review reported that the first week box-office gross at fifteen Los Angeles, California theaters was $90,000. Critical response =Contemporaneous= On release, the film was frequently compared to Friday the 13th due to their shared settings and whodunit plot structure. A review in The Courier-Journal characterized the film as a \\"Low- budget slasher in the Friday the 13th mold, with teen-age mayhem at a summer camp.\\" In the Chula Vista Star-News, the film was deemed \\"a tasteless picture about mysterious murders at a summer youth camp that obscenely blends beheadings, stabbings, pubescent impulses, homosexuality, and transvestism with a cast of junior high school actors.\\" The News-Press called it \\"A shockingly good slasher film, if you use the relatively fine first Friday the 13th as a measuring stick... it's just another crazed killer stalking nubile summer campers. But, this time, there are some truly creative killings and interesting plot twists.\\" =Modern= On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Sleepaway Camp holds a 78% approval rating based on 23 reviews, with an average rating of 6.42/10. The consensus reads: \\"Sleepaway Camp is a standard teen slasher elevated by occasional moments of John Waters- esque weirdness and a twisted ending.‚Äù The website Bloody Disgusting gave the film a positive review, praising Felissa Rose's performance and the film's twist ending calling it \\"one of the most shocking seen since, possibly, Hitchcock's Psycho\\". AllMovie wrote in its review on the film, \\"While most of the gender-bending story's sexual confusion is ultimately half-baked\\", \\"Sleepaway Camp is distinctive enough to warrant required viewing for genre enthusiasts.\\" Over the years, the film has gained a cult following from fans of the slasher genre and garnered critical reappraisal. Film scholar Bart≈Çomiej Paszylk called the film \\"an exceptionally bad movie but a very good slasher.\\" Commenting on the performances in the film, film scholar Thomas Sipos wrote: \\"[the film] feels odd due to its contrasting acting styles. Most of the cast performs in a naturalistic manner, whereas Desiree Gould's performance as Aunt Martha is strikingly stylistic: broadly overplayed to the point of caricature.\\" In his book The Pleasure and Pain of Cult Horror Films: An Historical Survey (2009), Paszylk characterized Sleepaway Camp as \\"elevat[ing] the kids to the position of the movie's mass protagonist and becomes a tricky metaphor of the unspeakable pains and anxieties of growing up.\\" He further commented on the film's conclusion: \\"The epiphanous ending brings Sleepaway Camp further away from the likes of Friday the 13th and closer to such 1980s 'slashers with a twist' as Happy Birthday to Me (1981) and April Fool's Day (1986); but Hiltzik's movie goes even further than that: in this case the denouement doesn't just add a new dimension to everything we saw up to this point, but it pushes its way deep into our minds and stays with us forever.\\" The film was featured on episode 48 of the podcast How Did This Get Made?, where hosts Paul Scheer, Jason Mantzoukas, June Diane Raphael and guest host Zack Pearlman struggled to decipher the film's opening moments, due to the ambiguous relationships established at the beginning of the film. Scheer later recalled that it had been most fan-requested film \\"by a landslide.\\" Home media Anchor Bay Entertainment released Sleepaway Camp on DVD on August 8, 2000. Anchor Bay reissued this disc as part of a four-disc set entitled the Sleepaway Camp Survival Kit on August 20, 2002, which also contained the film's two sequels, as well as a bonus disc featuring footage from the unfinished third sequel. This boxed set, which featured a medical red cross on the front cover, was discontinued in late 2002 after the Red Cross filed a complaint against Anchor Bay, who subsequently redesigned the box art to remove the cross logo. In 2005, the Canadian-based Legacy Entertainment released a region-free budget DVD release of the film. However, unlike the original VHS release, this release contains numerous edits to the film to either shorten violence or certain moments like dialogue. Scream Factory released the film in a collector's edition Blu-ray set on May 27, 2014. This release contains a 2K scan of the original camera negative, and this release also has the film in its original uncut version, unlike the DVD released by Anchor Bay. Related works In the late 1980s, Hiltzik sold the rights to the successive Sleepaway Camp films, after which Michael A. Simpson directed two sequels, Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers (1988) and Sleepaway Camp III: Teenage Wasteland (1989). In them, Angela (now played by Bruce Springsteen's younger sister, Pamela Springsteen) resurfaces at a nearby summer camp, but this time masquerading as a counselor after a sex reassignment surgery. Much like at the previous camp, she gleefully tortures and kills anyone who misbehaves or annoys her. These films had more of a satirical comic tone than the original. Another sequel, Sleepaway Camp IV: The Survivor, directed by Jim Markovic, was partially filmed in the early 1990s but left incompleted. In 2002 the unfinished footage was released and made available as an exclusive fourth disc in Anchor Bay/Starz Entertainment's Sleepaway Camp DVD boxed set. In 2012 the film was completed using archival footage from the first three films and released on DVD and Amazon Video on Demand. A fifth film, Return to Sleepaway Camp, was completed in 2003 and initially struggled to have its visual effects completed. It was directed by Robert Hiltzik, the director of the original 1983 film. According to Fangoria, the digital effects were redone from 2006 to 2008. The film was released in 2008. The purportedly final film in the Sleepaway Camp series, titled Sleepaway Camp Reunion, was also announced to be in the works. Distribution had been arranged via Magnolia Pictures. Creator Robert Hiltzik, who recovered the rights to the franchise, has stated that he would make the film if his budget was met. However, Hiltzik and Return To Sleepaway Camp producer Jeff Hayes later announced themselves as having started work on a reboot that would retain the key characters and elements of the original film with additional storyline elements and a dose of modernizing. As of Summer 2014, Hiltzik was reportedly tweaking the script. In addition, Michael Simpson, the director of Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers and Sleepaway Camp III: Teenage Wasteland, wrote a script for a further film called Sleepaway Camp: Berserk. A documentary film on the series, entitled Angela: The Official Sleepaway Camp Documentary, is currently in pre- production, with Felissa Rose as executive producer.

Originated by Elissa Leeds in 1976, she was portrayed by Julia Barr from 1976 to 1981 and from 1982 to 2006. Harriet Hall temporarily played the role in 1981. Barr made a special appearance as Brooke on January 5, 2010, as part of the series' 40th anniversary, and returned on February 23, 2010, for a three-month stint until April 23, 2010. She later returned for the show's final week on ABC on September 16, 2011. She returned as Brooke on the Prospect Park's continuation of All My Children. Barr earned eight Daytime Emmy Award nominations for the role, and won twice in 1990 and 1998 for Best Supporting Actress. Storylines Arriving in Pine Valley In 1976, Brooke English arrived on the doorstep of Phoebe Tyler, her aunt, as a wild teenager who was struggling to find her true love. She moved into the Tyler Mansion and started dating Dan Kennicott. She also continued to see her old boyfriend, the dangerous Benny Sago. She pitted the two men against each other, and they fought for her affections. She was out of control, so much so that Phoebe nearly shipped her home. Benny had tried to blackmail Phoebe into letting Brooke stay. Brooke vs. Erica Brooke soon stopped caring about Dan and Benny and fell for Tom Cudahy. He was also being pursued by Erica Kane, and the two women's longstanding rivalry was born. Erica managed to win Tom's heart and he married her. Brooke returned to her relationship with Dan, where she was the mistress, as he was seeing Devon Shepherd. Phoebe, faking paralysis, caught Dan and Brooke in a compromising situation, and threatened to throw out Brooke again. This was offset when Brooke found out about Phoebe's fake paralysis and blackmailed her into keeping her in the Tyler Mansion. Dan eventually broke up with Devon and wanted to try a relationship with Brooke again. Brooke, however, soon started sleeping with Erica's half brother Mark Dalton. Mark made it clear that the relationship was only about sex. Dan discovered the relationship and left town. Brooke, still trying to find the right man, began an affair with (and manager of singer Kelly Cole) Eddie Dorrance. He ended up raping her. When he was killed, Brooke learned that was pregnant with his child. She chose to terminate the pregnancy. Brooke and Tom began to have an affair, as Tom had separated from Erica. When Erica returned from California as an unsuccessful actress, she convinced Tom to give their marriage another try. Her lies finally caused Tom to divorce her and propose to Brooke. The two married. Motherhood Brooke had slightly grown out of her teenage rebellious phase, and took a job as a reporter. She made the discovery that her mother, Peg English, was the leader of an international drug cartel known as The Cobra. It was yet to be revealed that Brooke was adopted. her father and Phoebe's brother died and Peg was sent to prison. Before she could reveal who Brooke's real mother was, she was killed. This compounded onto the problem of Tom's drinking. He and Erica, Brooke's archrival, had an affair the night before Erica was to marry Adam Chandler. This is while Brooke was pregnant with her and Tom's child. Brooke was helped through the pregnancy by Mark, and gave birth to a daughter, Laura Cudahy. Brooke had become a rising TV anchorwoman, but ran into problems with this. She exposed a municipal scandal and refused to reveal her source, and was sent to prison. When she got out of prison, there was an assassination attempt on her and Mark's lives at a party. Erica's fianc√©, Mike Roy, took the bullet instead of Brooke & Mark. After a while, Brooke's busy schedule led to her break up with Mark. She briefly dated Giles St. Clair, a stuntman. But his lifestyle was too wild and interfered with her role as Laura's mother. She also learned that her biological mother was a homeless woman named Jane Dorbin. Brooke tracked her down and the two built a relationship. Brooke met one of Erica's exes, the wealthy Adam Chandler. The two fell in love. Brooke married Adam quickly. Their happiness was very short-lived when Brooke's beloved daughter, Laura, was killed by a drunk driver. It is an event that stayed with Brooke for the rest of her life, as she continued to mourn the loss of her pride and joy. When Brooke discovered that she could not bear any more children, Adam began to get anxious to have an heir to the Chandler fortune. He hired Dixie Cooney, the niece of Palmer Cortlandt, his bitter business rival, to be a nanny. He began to have an affair with her. She soon gave birth to his son, JR Chandler. The affair cost him his marriage to Brooke. They divorced, and Brooke began to work closely with Dixie's true love, Tad Martin. Tad and Dixie married after Dixie's brief marriage with Adam ended, but the marriage between Tad and Dixie also soon ended. When Tad and Dixie separated, he and Brooke had a brief affair. Tad was soon \\"killed\\" on a blown up bridge, fighting with Billy Clyde Tuggle. Soon after, Brooke discovered, much to her surprise, that she was pregnant! She told everyone that her pregnancy was because of artificial insemination to protect Dixie, after Tad had reconciled with her before he \\"died\\". She then told the citizens of Pine Valley that she was pregnant with his best friend and former husband, Tom Cudahy's child. Tom and Brooke led everyone to believe this which discouraged any thoughts that the baby might be Tad's because Brooke did not want to cause any more pain to Dixie. Brooke in the early 90s While Brooke was pregnant, she began to rely on Jackson Montgomery, another one of Erica's old flames. The two grew close in friendship. Brooke nearly lost her baby when she and Jack were hit by Arlene Vaughan, who was driving drunk at the time. Despite having to be cut out of her car, Brooke gave birth to a healthy baby boy, James Edward Martin, whom she called Jamie. Her miracle child has become Brooke's pride and joy, following the death of Laura. Erica began to figure out a way to win Jack back. She prodded Brooke until Brooke saw that Jack still cared deeply for Erica. Brooke also went public with the fact that Jamie was Tad's son. Brooke continued to raise Jamie. She began to see Edmund Grey, whose hot and cold behaviour left her angry and his obsession with discovering his lineage and birthright strained the ties between them. Brooke experienced a jolt when Tad returned to Pine Valley in 1993. Tad wanted to become a good father to Jamie, and married Brooke. Once again, Tad's love with Dixie would not be denied and they started to have another affair. Tad lied to Brooke about his whereabouts. Edmund knew the truth, and wanting to win back Brooke, he told her about Tad's affair in hopes of breaking up Brooke's marriage. Brooke vowed to stay with Tad. She became pregnant again, but tragedy would strike when it was discovered the pregnancy was ectopic. The termination of the pregnancy was necessary to save Brooke's life. Shortly after, Brooke realized that Tad would never love her the same way he loved Dixie, so she ended their marriage. Brooke continued to have a cordial friendship with Tad, as Tad became Jamie's father. Brooke began to focus on her career and raising her son. Adopting Laura Brooke was chosen as Pine Valley's Woman of the Year. At the ceremony, Laura Kirk, a homeless teen, publicly accused Brooke of not doing enough to help the cause of the homeless. Brooke vowed to do more. She began to work closely with Laura, and they developed a bond. Adam Chandler wanted Brooke back, but she was still reeling from their previous marriage, which ended when he had an affair with Dixie. She stayed away from him and guarded herself. Adam and Liza Colby put together a scheme for Brooke to return to Adam and for Tad to return to Liza. Brooke realized that she didn't love Adam enough to put up with him. Brooke met and fell for Pierce Riley in 1996. He lived in the woods with Laura and Janet Green, an ex-con. When Pierce and Brooke began to date, Janet attempted to steal Brooke's identity as she also had feelings for Pierce. Her scheme didn't work. Brooke also brought Laura to her home and adopted her as her second daughter. However, Brooke wanted to devote more time to Jamie and Laura, so she broke up with Pierce. He left for New Mexico, but returned a few months later. Things began heating up between him and Brooke, and they became engaged. But Pierce was a troubled man who was suffering from disturbing flashbacks that included gunshots and a woman from Pierce's past. He painfully confessed to Brooke that he may have shot the woman in the flashbacks. She urged him to seek help and gave her support while he underwent psychological therapy. Undergoing hypnosis, Pierce remembered that he fell in love with the woman in his flashbacks, Christina, in Central America. They had a daughter named Amelia. He also remembered being forced to shoot either Christina or Amelia by a soldier. The soldier pulled the trigger of the gun in Pierce's hands, shooting Christina. Pierce suffered a breakdown due to the memory, and Brooke vowed to look for Amelia. No one knew that Christina was still alive. She survived the gunshot wounds and spent two decades in a Central American jail. When Brooke began looking for Amelia, the captors released Christina, who headed to Pine Valley under the name \\"Diana Martinez\\" to tell her story to the world-renowned reporter Brooke English. She didn't know that Brooke was in love with Pierce. When the truth was exposed, Pierce had to choose between Brooke and Christina. Pierce soon left Pine Valley with Christina, devastating Brooke. Standing trial for murder Brooke devoted her time to her work. She was nominated for an award in New York. On the way home to Pine Valley, her plane crashed. Everyone aboard was killed except for Brooke, Edmund, his daughter Maddie Grey and another man. Brooke tried to save the life of Edmund's wife, Maria Santos Grey, but Maria made Brooke save Maddie's life instead. The plane went over the cliff and into the water. Maria's body was never found and was presumed dead, much to Edmund's sadness. While searching for the truth behind the plane crash, she met a man that would help her through the ordeal, as he was the fourth survivor, Jim Thomasen. Jim had trailed Brooke from New York, because he knew that she was a wealthy woman and had just adopted Laura. Laura and Jim had a past in New York. Jim took pornographic pictures of Laura when she was younger. Laura had posed for the pictures for money to help take care of her sick mother, Terry Kirk. Laura discovered that the photos remained on the Internet. Brooke teamed with Jim to find out about why the plane crashed. Jim was with her every step of the way, and they learned that the plane's crash was attributed to faulty turbine blades and that Adam Chandler was behind it. Soon after, Luara was kidnapped by a drug addict named Ricky, who had posed in the pictures with Laura. He, unknown to Brooke, was hired by Jim. Brooke would find the pictures thanks to a tip-off and receive a ransom note demanding that the police were not to be notified about Laura's disappearance. She obeyed and told Jim she would drop the money herself. Jim \\"saved\\" Laura, became a hero in Brooke's eyes. Though she told Brooke that she knew Ricky, the former didn't tell her mother that Jim had been the photographer after declaring a truce with him to keep it a secret between themselves. Wanting Brooke for herself, Jim told Laura that she should move to Boston where no one would know her. Laura would leave Pine Valley after the New Year's in 1998. Brooke was soon notified that there was new evidence in the plane crash. It was a luggage fragment that contained explosives. Despite Jim's warning to leave it alone, Brooke wouldn't let it rest. While in Jim's apartment, she went through his closet trying to find something and stumbled across the same style luggage found in the wreckage. She confronted him, and he explained it with lies. Brooke hired Mateo Santos to do undercover work and find out as much as he could about Jim. The truth about Jim shocked Brooke. She arranged a meeting with him at the Chandler Gallery. She showed him the photos of Laura that he had taken. Jim promised that if she called the police, he would take the same type of photos of Jamie. This drove Brooke over the edge and she took out a gun, shooting Jim several times in the back. Scared about the murder charges and convinced that she wouldn't win the trial, Brooke went on the run with Jamie. Finally, Tad convinced her to return to Pine Valley and stand trial. Thanks to Tad's secret maneuvering, Brooke was able to get an acquittal of murder. However, the event still haunted Brooke. Brooke in the 2000s Laura would soon leave Pine Valley to study in China. Brooke began to date Dimitri Marick, again another former love of Erica. Erica succeeded in quickly ending the relationship. After that Brooke began to refocus on her career and raising Jamie. In early 2000, Brooke began to work at the community centre, working herself to the bone. Reverend Eliot Freeman soon found that this was for the guilt she felt about her real daughter Laura's death years before. It came to the surface when Arlene Vaughan was drunk and crashed her car into a telephone pole that broke through the community centre's wall. Eliot comforted and consulted Brooke about the pain that she was still holding for her daughter's death. However, Brooke was unaware that Eliot had a secret he was keeping from her, his real identity. Before \\"finding God,\\" Eliot went by another name, Josh Waleski. He was the man who had killed her daughter. Eliot was eventually forced into telling Brooke that he was the man who had taken her daughter from him. Brooke erupted in a fury and lashed out at Eliot for having lied to her for months. More importantly, Brooke was left to question herself for allowing herself to fall in love with the man who had killed her daughter. Eliot decided to leave town to help Brooke heal. Before Eliot left for good, Brooke finally found a way to forgive Eliot. The next year, Brooke's adopted daughter Laura suffered an Ecstasy overdose. It aggravated a pre-existing heart condition. The only surgeon that could perform the risky operation was Dr. David Hayward, who was in prison. Brooke was helped by of all people, Erica, in order to free David. Laura survived the surgery but still needed a heart transplant. That spring, Brooke begged Leo du Pres to pretend to be interested in the dying Laura in order to give Laura motivation to fight for her life. At first, Leo refused. But he soon grew closer with Laura. He seemed to really care for Laura and wanted to see her fully recover. Laura's condition would soon worsen, and Brooke paid a married couple to donate the heart of their dead nephew. On June 18, 2001, Leo proposed to Laura, and she accepted. They married two days later in her hospital room with Brooke, with friends and hospital staff in attendance. Laura's health continued to worsen and the only way to save her life was for a heart transplant. Laura eventually received a heart transplant from Gillian Andrassy, who died after she was shot. In early 2002, Brooke convinced an unwinding Laura to seek out professional help. Soon, Brooke began to suspect that Maria Santos Grey was still alive. She had seen a painting of Wildwind, the estate in Pine Valley that belonged to the Grey family, drawn by a Maureen Gorman. Brooke was convinced that Maureen Gorman was an alive Maria. She and Tad traveled to Nevada to find Maureen. When Brooke saw Maureen and realized it was indeed the long thought dead Maria, she fainted. Later that night, Tad went to find Maria, but saw a different girl and assumed that was who Brooke saw. He tried to convince Brooke that she just \\"thought\\" she saw Maria. Brooke and Edmund finally married. At their wedding, Maddie saw Maria and followed her. She burst into the chapel moments later, announcing that she had been with her mother. This was just after the marriage ceremony was complete and Brooke and Edmund were officially married. Brooke finally admitted that she knew Maria was really alive, causing Edmund to find Maria. Their marriage was annulled, but Brooke continued to help Edmund reunite with Maria. Following this, Brooke began an affair with Adam Chandler. Brooke told Adam that she would only continue the affair if it remained a secret. But soon Brooke realized that others knew about it, and she quickly ended the relationship. Brooke began to rebuild her friendship with Edmund, after all of her deception. But she also began to worry about Jamie. Unknown to anyone, Jamie had slept with newcomer Babe Carey, the night before it was announced that Babe had married Jamie's former stepbrother JR (Adam Jr.) in San Diego weeks before. Both had been drunk, but Babe still took Jamie's virginity. Babe soon became pregnant, and Brooke worried that Jamie might be the father. When it was revealed that the father of Babe's daughter, Bess, was indeed JR and not Jamie, Brooke was relieved. However, it was then figured out that Bess was really Miranda Montgomery, the newborn daughter of Bianca. Brooke's world was rocked when Edmund was killed in the Wildwind barn one night. Brooke had to tell Maria that she was the executor of Edmund's estate, and had more control over Maria's children and the Wildwind estate than Maria. The two women remained at odds, until they found a way to co-exist for the sake of Maria's children. When her Aunt Phoebe died, Brooke was inconsolable. She soon found out that Phoebe had left everything to Jamie provided he dumped Babe. Jamie had a tough time letting go of Babe but eventually did. Jamie would later start a relationship with the recently returned Amanda Dillon, but after Amanda's unstable mother Janet wreaked havoc on Pine Valley, Brooke welcomed a devastated Amanda into her home as if she were her daughter. Eventually, Jamie and Amanda stopped seeing each other. Over the last couple of months in Pine Valley, Brooke remained in the background, focusing on raising Jamie and Amanda. She also became a stepping stone in the renewed relationship of Erica and Jack. While the two were separated, Erica invited her first husband Jeff Martin to Thanksgiving dinner, while Jack invited her bitter rival, Brooke. Brooke quickly realized that Jack didn't love her like Erica. Quietly, Brooke left Pine Valley at the tail end of 2006. However, Brooke reappeared in the All My Children 40th anniversary special four years later and on February 23, 2010, she returned until departing again exactly two months later. In that short period of time, Brooke and her ex-husband Adam Chandler went off into the sunset together in a particularly romantic happy ending. Exit in 2006 In 2006, Barr was taken off contract and was asked to remain with the show on a recurring basis, but she declined the offer. The producers then decided not to recast the role after her departure. For many years prior, Brooke had floundered in the background. Her last major story was her interrupted marriage to Edmund Grey which occurred in 2002. Despite 30 years of service to All My Children, at that time neither Barr nor Brooke received any formal farewell; the character simply vanished, and was then mentioned only infrequently. When she left, Barr said, \\"I am so proud to have been a part of a show that was once a television icon.\\" Return in 2010 and 2011 Barr eventually returned in 2010, first with the All My Children 40th anniversary special in January, and then for a two-month stint from February to April during which time Brooke takes over as editor-in-chief of Tempo, is involved in a terrible car accident, and falls in love, all of which culminate with Brooke and her former husband Adam Chandler, reuniting and officially leaving town together. Adam and Brooke returned to Pine Valley for the final episodes of the series in September 2011. They initially return to help a very troubled JR. Still a couple, Brooke is there with Adam when he discovers Stuart is alive and purchases the Chandler Mansion as a present for Adam with the inheritance money from her Aunt Phoebe after it is sold away from the family. The final scenes of the show take place in the Chandler mansion on September 23, 2011 during which Adam proposes to Brooke and she accepts. Return in 2013 Brooke is the first character to be seen in the reboot of the show. Adam re-proposes to Brooke, claiming she is the only woman he has ever truly loved, and she then accepts his proposal. She and Adam are the guardians of Adam's grandson, AJ Chandler as his dad, JR has been in a coma for five years. She has an assistant, Celia Fitzgerald, who volunteers with her at the Miranda Center. Brooke also agrees to take over as Head of Chandler Enterprises, because Adam is travelling so much and spends much of her time helping Adam to rebuild the company that JR ruined before he was shot.

He is best known by the general public for the book What is Mathematics?, co-written with Herbert Robbins. Life and career Courant was born in Lublinitz, in the Prussian Province of Silesia. His parents were Siegmund Courant and Martha Courant n√©e Freund of Oels. Edith Stein was Richard's cousin on the paternal side. During his youth his parents moved often, including to Glatz, then to Breslau and in 1905 to Berlin. He stayed in Breslau and entered the university there, then continued his studies at the University of Z√ºrich and the University of G√∂ttingen. He became David Hilbert's assistant in G√∂ttingen and obtained his doctorate there in 1910. He was obliged to serve in World War I, but was wounded shortly after enlisting and therefore dismissed from the military. Courant left the University of M√ºnster in 1921 to take over Erich Heckes position at the University of G√∂ttingen. There he founded the Mathematical Institute, which he headed as director from 1928 until 1933. Courant left Germany in 1933, earlier than many Jewish escapees. He did not lose his position due to being Jewish, as his previous service as a front-line soldier exempted him; however, his public membership in the social-democratic left was reason enough (for the Nazis) for dismissal. In 1936, after one year at Cambridge, Courant accepted a professorship at New York University in New York City. There he founded an institute for graduate studies in applied mathematics. The Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences (as it was renamed in 1964) is now one of the most respected research centers in applied mathematics. Courant and David Hilbert authored the influential textbook Methoden der mathematischen Physik, which, with its revised editions, is still current and widely used since its publication in 1924. With Herbert Robbins he coauthored a popular overview of higher mathematics, intended for the general public, titled What is Mathematics?. With Fritz John he also coauthored the two-volume work Introduction to Calculus and Analysis, first published in 1965. Courant's name is also attached to the finite element method, with his numerical treatment of the plain torsion problem for multiply-connected domains, published in 1943. This method is now one of the ways to solve partial differential equations numerically. Courant is a namesake of the Courant‚ÄìFriedrichs‚ÄìLewy condition and the Courant minimax principle. Courant died of a stroke in New Rochelle, New York on January 27, 1972.NY Times Obituary \\"Dr. Richard Courant Dies at 84; Influential Mathematics Scholar; Organizer and Ex. Direcgor of Institute at N.Y.U. Aided Research and Teaching\\" Perspective on mathematics Commenting upon his analysis of experimental results from in-laboratory soap film formations, Courant believed that the existence of a physical solution does not obviate mathematical proof. Here is a quote from Courant on his mathematical perspective: Personal life In 1912 Courant married Nelly Neumann, who had earned her doctorate at Breslau in synthetic geometry in 1909. They lived together in G√∂ttingen until they were divorced in 1916. She was later murdered by the Nazis in 1942 for being Jewish. In 1919 Courant married Nerina (Nina) Runge (1891‚Äì1991), a daughter of the G√∂ttingen professor for Applied Mathematics, Carl Runge (of Runge‚ÄìKutta fame). Richard and Nerina had four children: Ernest, a particle physicist and innovator in particle accelerators; Gertrude (1922‚Äì2014), a PhD biologist and wife of the mathematician J√ºrgen Moser (1928‚Äì1999); Hans, a physicist who participated in the Manhattan Project; and Leonore (known as \\"Lori,\\" 1928‚Äì2015), a professional violist and wife of the mathematician Jerome Berkowitz (1928‚Äì1998) and subsequently wife of mathematician Peter Lax until her death.

Hiltzik did not know that his film had gained such a devoted following over the years, until he was contacted in March 2000 by Sleepawaycampmovies.com's Jeff Hayes, who arranged for him to record a commentary for the film's Anchor Bay Entertainment DVD. After a number of sequels directed and written by others, Hiltzik returned to write and direct a 2003 sequel, Return to Sleepaway Camp. He decided that this newest chapter would ignore the storylines of the other sequels, saying that he wanted to pick up where the original film had ended. The production was stopped for some time (according to Fangoria.com, the digital effects were being redone) before being released in 2008 as a direct-to-video sequel. Hiltzik has directed only these two films. External links * 1957 births Living people American people of Polish descent Horror film directors Maurice A.

No lives on her were lost, thanks to heroic rescue efforts, in blizzard conditions. However, another ship sank, en route to the scene, the Margate lugger Victory which was lost along with her crew. The Belle was constructed in 1853, under the ownership of J. P. Whitney and Co. of New Orleans. Her common routes were New Orleans to Liverpool and Le Havre, carrying wheat on the outbound run. A barque of 1,150 tons burden with a crew of 23, she was on a voyage from New York to London, with a cargo of wheat, flour, and linseed cake, when as a result of an unusually heavy gale had to put into Kingsgate, Kent. She anchored 3/4 of a mile from the shore, however by 6 am she was riding heavily, the sea occasionally breaking completely over her. The storm was so ferocious that the main and mizzen masts were cut away by the crew at 6.30am. The Margate lugger Victory, along with the Ocean, and the Eclipse attempted a rescue and possible salvage. The Victory was lost along with her crew at 11.30 am. The storm raged all day and local lifeboats were not able to launch. The Belle parted from her anchors at midnight, and was driven onto the rocks beneath nearby cliffs, at Foreness Point. The crew lashed themselves to the one remaining mast and were spotted from the beach at dawn. Two lifeboats, the Mary White and the Culmer White made three trips to rescue them. The lifeboats and crew were from Broadstairs and Margate. The Mary White had to be hauled and dragged two miles over fields of snow to bring it to a place from which it could be launched. Captain Tateand and his crew from the Northern Belle were all saved. The return of the Mary White from the wreck of the Northern Belle with seven of the crew On 15 January 1857 (Thursday) the Illustrated Times of London advertised that they would print five engravings of the tragedy and portraits of the crew the following Saturday. It was reported on 22 January, in a letter to the London Evening Standard, that the ship and cargo were still on the reef, in good condition, and were salvageable. News of the disaster was broadcast world- wide, as far as the Sydney Morning Herald who picked up the story from the New York Times. A benefit by \\"gentlemen amateurs\\" was held at the St James's Theatre, in London, on 7 February. On 23 February 1857 3,340 barrels of damaged American flour, part of the cargo, was auctioned off at the New Corn Exchange Coffee House, Mark Lane, London. On 2 March, another 450 barrels of damaged American flour and 20 barrels of damaged Linseed cake was auctioned at the coffee house. The rescued crew are taken to The Captain Digby The Times reported on 5 March that the vessel was a shipping hazard and all her cargo had been salvaged except forty to fifty logs of mahogany. It was thought that only two barrels of dynamite would be required to destroy the wreck. The Liverpool Echo pointed out on 9 March 1857 that the wreck in foggy weather was an obstacle to navigation, \\"A few days ago a ship had a narrow escape by striking it.\\" In April 1857, the U.S. president Franklin Pierce had 21 silver medals struck and issued an award of ¬£270 sterling for sharing amongst the rescuers, ¬£10‚Äì¬£30 per man. The London Morning Chronicle of 9 October 1857 reported that the wreck was to be raised, and that chains had been fitted with a view of floating her with the aid of buoys at the next spring tides. Some Whitstable people had bought the hull for ¬£260. Attempts to raise the Belle on 21 November 1857 were unsuccessful despite successfully raising the stern out of the water with the help of four pontoons. One of the chains around the hull broke during the process, aborting the attempt. The masts disappeared from view in early December, and a green buoy marked wreck was put in place 10 fathoms eastward from the stern. In June 1858 Canterbury Town Council, put on display a piece of the wreck taken from the recently raised hull, which was completely riddled with Teredo worm. A Margate beer shop was named the Northern Belle in 1858. The crew of the Mary White in their life-boat are drawn through Broadstairs on 6 January 1857. Legacy The tragedy inspired several literary works including novels and poetry. Charles Mackay published a poem \\"Northern Belle ‚Äì a tribute to the brave\\", in February 1857. Edwin Arnold wrote \\"The Wreck of the Northern Belle\\" with the proceeds to go to representatives of the Victory crew.

The car-free movement is a broad, informal, emergent network of individuals and organizations, including social activists, urban planners, transportation engineers and others, brought together by a shared belief that large and/or high-speed motorized vehicles (cars, trucks, tractor units, motorcycles, etc.)Car free movement opposing not only cars but many motorized vehicles are too dominant in most modern cities. The goal of the movement is to create places where motorized vehicle use is greatly reduced or eliminated, by converting road and parking space to other public uses and rebuilding compact urban environments where most destinations are within easy reach by other means, including walking, cycling, public transport, personal transporters, and mobility as a service.  Context  A quadracycle parked on a Canadian urban street between cars Before the twentieth century, cities and towns were normally compact, containing narrow streets busy with human activity. In the early twentieth century, many of these settlements were adapted to accommodate the car with wider roads, more car parking spaces, and lower population densities, with space between urban buildings reserved for automotive use. Lower population densities meant urban sprawl with longer distances between places. The low cost of use brought traffic congestion which made older transport unattractive or impractical, and created the conditions for more traffic and sprawl; the car system was \\"increasingly able to 'drive' out competitors, such as feet, bikes, buses and trains\\". This process led to changes in urban form and living patterns that offered little opportunity for people without a car. Some governments have responded with policies and regulations aimed at reversing auto dependency by increasing urban densities, encouraging mixed use development and infill, reducing space allocated to private cars, increasing walkability, supporting cycling and other alternative vehicles similar in size and speed, and public transport. Globally, urban planning is evolving in an effort to increase public transport and non-motorized transport modal shares and shift away from private transport oriented development. Cities like Hong Kong developed a highly integrated public transportation system which effectively reduced the use of private transport.Step out of your cars to embrace your cities  Cities Now In contrast with private automotive travel, car sharing, where people can easily rent a car for a few hours rather than own one, is emerging as an increasingly important element for urban transportation. Urban design Passenger Capacity of different Transport Modes Road Space Requirements Proponents of the car-free movement focus on both sustainable and public transport (bus, tram, etc.) options and on urban design, zoning, school placement policies, urban agriculture, telecommuting options, and housing developments that create proximity or access so that long-distance transportation becomes less of a requirement of daily life. New urbanism is an American urban design movement that arose in the early 1980s. Its goal has been to reform all aspects of real estate development and urban planning, from urban retrofits to suburban infill. New urbanist neighborhoods are designed to contain a diverse range of housing and jobs, and to be walkable. Other, more auto-oriented cities are also making incremental changes to provide transportation alternatives through Complete streets improvements. World Squares for all is a scheme to remove much of the traffic from major squares in London, including Trafalgar Square and Parliament Square. Car-free cities are, as the name implies, entire cities (or at least the inner parts thereof) which have been made entirely car-free. Car-free zones are areas of a city or town where the use of cars is prohibited or greatly restricted. To make the car-free zones/cities, (movable and/or stationary) traffic bollards and other barriers are often used to deny car access. Living streets and complete streets prioritize the needs of users of the street as a whole over those of car drivers. They are designed to be shared by pedestrians, playing children, bicyclists, and low-speed motor vehicles. The ring road around Amsterdam (shown in red). At exits of ring roads such as this, distribution centers can be set up. Distribution centers allow easy restocking of supermarkets, outlet stores, restaurants, and more in city centers. They rely on tractor units to unload their cargo in the suburban distribution center. The products are then placed in a small truck (sometimes electrically poweredCity depot employing a few electric trucks ), freight bicycle, or other vehicle to bridge the last mile to the destination in the city center. Besides offering advantages to the population (increased safety due to truck drivers having less blind spots, reduced noise/traffic, reduced tailpipe emissions, and more), it also offers financial advantage for the companies, as tractor units require a lot of time to bridge this last mile (they lack agility and consume much fuel in congested streets). The method above however still doesn't reduce car use inside non- car-free city centers (customers often use cars to fetch their groceries or appliances from city stores, since they have so much storage space). This problem is solved by means of online food ordering systems, which allow customers to order online, and then have it delivered to their doorstep by the supermarket or store itself, through bicycle couriers (using freight bicycles), electric delivery robots and delivery vans.DoorDash and Walmart join forcesSainsbury's trials UK's first cargo bike Delivery vans allow to take along more cargo and deliver to several customers on a same trip. These food ordering systems could provide for a smooth transition for those cities that wish to become car-free as it can reduce both personal car use and personal car demand in cities. At the outskirts of towns, between the exits of the rings roads, and the car-free zones in the city center themselves, additional car parking lots can be added, generally in the form of underground car parks (to avoid it taking up surface space).Plan to make Brussels car-free includes new underground parking spaces Careful placement of these car-parking lots is needed though, ensuring that they are made far enough from the city centers (and closer to the ring roads) to avoid them attracting more cars to the city center. In some instances, near these car parking lots, Park and ride public transport (i.e. bus) stops are foreseen, or bicycle-sharing systems are present. Community bicycle programs provide bicycles within an urban environment for short term use. The first successful scheme was in the 1960s in Amsterdam and can now be found in many other cities with 20,000 bicycles introduced to Paris in 2007 in the V√©lib' scheme. Dockless bike share systems have recently appeared in the United States and provide more convenience for people wanting to rent a bike for a short time period. Advocacy groups The Campaign for Better Transport (formerly known as Transport2000) was formed in 1972 in Britain to challenge proposed cuts in the British rail network and since then has promoted public transport. Car Free Walks is a UK-based website encouraging walkers to use public transport to reach the start and end of walks, rather than using a car. Activism groups Road protests in the United Kingdom rose to prominence in the early 1990s in response to a major road building program both in urban communities and also rural areas. Reclaim the Streets, a movement formed in 1991 in London, \\"invaded\\" major roads, highway or freeway to stage parties. While this may obstruct the regular users of these spaces such as car drivers and public bus riders, the philosophy of RTS is that it is vehicle traffic, not pedestrians, who are causing the obstruction, and that by occupying the road they are in fact opening up public space. In Flanders, the organization Fietsersbond has called upon the government to ban tractor units in city centers.Fietsersbond vraagt overheid tot verbieden van grote trucks\\"Fietsersbond\\" or \\"cyclist union\\" in Flanders Critical Mass rides emerged in 1992 in San Francisco where cyclists take to the streets en masse to dominate the traffic, using the slogan \\"we are traffic.\\" The ride was founded with the idea of drawing attention to how unfriendly the city was to bicyclists. The movement has grown to include events in major metropolitan cities around the world. The World Naked Bike Ride was born in 2001 in Spain with the first naked bike rides, which then emerged as the WNBR in 2004 a concept which rapidly spread through collaborations with many different activist groups and individuals around the world to promote bicycle transportation, renewable energy, recreation, walkable communities, and environmentally responsible, sustainable living. Parking Days started in 2005 when REBAR, a collaborative group of creators, designers and activists based in San Francisco, transformed a metered parking spot into a small park complete with turf, seating, and shade and by 2007 there were 180 parks in 27 cities around the world. Official events Car Free Days are official events with the common goal of taking a fair number of cars off the streets of a city or some target area or neighborhood for all or part of a day, in order to give the people who live and work there a chance to consider how their city might look and work with significantly fewer cars. The first events were organized in Reykjav√≠k (Iceland), Bath (UK) and La Rochelle (France) in 1995. Jakarta, Indonesia is one such city that hosts weekly Car- Free days. Ciclov√≠a is a similar event in many cities that places a large emphasis on cycling as an alternative to auto travel. The event originated in Bogot√°, Colombia in 1974. Now, Bogot√° holds weekly ciclov√≠as that turn the streets into giant car-free celebrations complete with stages set up in city parks with aerobics instructors, yoga teachers, and musicians leading people through various performances. The event has inspired similar celebrations globally. In town, without my car! is an EU campaign and day every autumn (Northern Hemisphere) for an increased use of vehicles other than the car. It has since spread beyond the EU, and in 2004 more than 40 countries participated. World Urbanism Day was founded in 1949 in Buenos Aires and is celebrated in more than 30 countries on four continents each November 8. Towards Car-free Cities is the annual conference of the World Car-free Network and provides a focal point for diverse aspects of the emerging global car-free movement. The conference has been held in major cities around the world, including Portland, Oregon, United States in 2008 (its first time in North America), and has also been in Istanbul, Turkey; Bogota, Colombia; Budapest, Hungary; Berlin, Germany; Prague, Czech Republic; Timi»ôoara, Romania; and Lyon, France. The conference series attempts to bridge the gap between many of the diverse people and organizations interested in reducing urban dependence on the automobile. Transportation Alternative's Annual Commuter Race pits a bicyclist against both a subway rider and a cab rider in a race from Queens to Manhattan. The Fifth Annual Commuter race took place in May 2009, where bicyclist Rachel Myers beat straphanger Dan Hendrick and cab rider Willie Thompson to make it the fifth year the contestant on the bicycle won. Myers took the 2009 title with a time of 20 minutes and 15 seconds to make the 4.2 mile trek from Sunnyside, Queens to Columbus Circle in Manhattan. Hendrick showed up 15 minutes later off the subway and Thompson arrived via cab nearly a half-hour after that. Transportation Alternatives is a group that \\"seeks to change New York City's transportation priorities to encourage and increase non-polluting, quiet, city-friendly travel and decrease‚Äînot ban‚Äîprivate car use. [They] seek a rational transportation system based on a 'Green Transportation Hierarchy,' which gives preference to modes of travel based on their benefits and costs to society. To achieve its goals, T.A. works in five areas: Bicycling, Walking and Traffic Calming, Car-Free Parks, Safe Streets and Sensible Transportation.\\" The 2009 Commuter Race came on the heels of a Times Square traffic ban in NYC that drew national media attention. Car-free development Definitions and types There are many areas of the world where people have always lived without cars, because no road access is possible, or none has been provided. In developed countries these include islands and some historic neighborhoods or settlements, the largest example being the canal city of Venice. The term carfree development implies a physical change ‚Äì either new building or changes to an existing built area. Melia et al. (2010)Melia, S., Barton, H. and Parkhurst, G. (2010) Carfree, Low Car ‚Äì What's the Difference? World Transport Policy & Practice 16 (2), 24-32. define car-free development as follows: Car-free developments are residential or mixed use developments which: * Normally provide a traffic-free immediate environment, and: * Offer no parking or limited parking separated from the residence, and: * Are designed to enable residents to live without owning a car. This definition (which they distinguish from the more common \\"low car development\\") is based mainly on experience in Northwestern Europe, where the movement for car-free development began. Within this definition three types are identified: * Vauban model * Limited Access model * Pedestrian zones with residential population =Vauban= Vauban, Freiburg, Germany is according to this definition, the largest car-free development in Europe, with over 5,000 residents. Whether it can be considered car-free is open to debate: many local people prefer the term \\"stellplatzfrei\\" ‚Äì literally \\"free from parking spaces\\" to describe the traffic management system there. Vehicles are allowed down the residential streets at walking pace to pick up and deliver but not to park, although there are frequent infractions. Residents of the stellplatzfrei areas must sign an annual declaration stating whether they own a car or not. Car owners must purchase a place in one of the multi-storey car parks on the periphery, run by a council-owned company. The cost of these spaces ‚Äì ‚Ç¨17,500 in 2006, plus a monthly fee ‚Äì acts as a disincentive to car ownership. =Limited access type= The more common form of car free development involves some sort of physical barrier, which prevents motor vehicles from penetrating into a car-free center. Melia et al. describe this as the \\"Limited Access\\" type. In some cases such as Stellwerk 60 in Cologne, there is a removable barrier, controlled by a residents' organizations. In others cases, such as in Waterwijk, vehicular access is only available from the exterior. =Pedestrian zones= Whereas the first two models apply to newly built car free developments, most pedestrianized areas have been retro-fitted. Pedestrian zones may be considered car-free developments where they include a significant population and a low rate of vehicle ownership per household. The largest example in Europe is Groningen, Netherlands which had a city centre population of 16,500 in 2008.  Benefits and problems  Reduction in one's carbon footprint for various actions Several studies have been done on European car free developments. The most comprehensive was conducted in 2000 by Jan Scheurer.Scheurer, J. (2001) Urban Ecology, Innovations in Housing Policy and the Future of Cities: Towards Sustainability in Neighbourhood CommunitiesThesis (PhD), Murdoch University Institute of Sustainable Transport. Other more recent studies have been made of specific car-free areas such as Vienna's Florisdorf car-free development.Ornetzeder, M., Hertwich, E.G., Hubacek, K., Korytarova, K. and Haas, W. (2008) The environmental effect of car-free housing: A case in Vienna. Ecological Economics 65 (3), 516-530. The main benefits found for car free developments (summarized in Melia et al. 2010) found in the various studies are: * very low levels of car use, resulting in much less traffic on surrounding roads * high rates of walking and cycling * more independent movement and active play amongst children * less land taken for parking and roads ‚Äì more available for green or social space The main problems related to parking management. Where parking is not controlled in the surrounding area, this often results in complaints from neighbors about overspill parking.

He was created in 1965 by writer Bob Haney and artist Ramona Fradon. Metamorpho is a founding member of the Outsiders, and has also joined multiple incarnations of the Justice League. The character has been moderately popular since his introduction in 1965. Originally adventurer Rex Mason, he is converted into a man made of a shifting mass of chemicals after being cursed by an ancient artifact that he has retrieved. Publication history Metamorpho's creator, Bob Haney, had seen success with DC Comics in 1972 with the titles Metal Men and Doom Patrol, featuring bands of superheroes exhibiting fantastic powers. Under the editorial management of George Kashdan, Haney was asked to capitalize on these titles' popularity with a similar character. Metamorpho, the Element Man, debuted in The Brave and the Bold #57 (January 1972). As first conceived, Metamorpho was a parody of the fantastic characters that populated comic books in the 1960s. Artist Ramona Fradon was coaxed out of maternity retirement to illustrate Metamorpho's first appearances. The popularity of Metamorpho's appearances in The Brave and the Bold led to a 17-issue ongoing series between 1965 and 1968. Metamorpho also appeared during this time in two issues of Justice League of America (#42 and #44) and became the second superhero to decline an invitation to join that organization (Adam Strange being the first), though he did become a reservist, eventually being called in during a Justice League/Justice Society crossover to help find and rescue the Seven Soldiers of Victory. Metamorpho appears on the cover of Aquaman #30 as one of the pallbearers (along with Batman, Hawkman, and Superman) at the \\"Sea King's Funeral\\". Metamorpho also appears in a series of backup stories in Action Comics #413‚Äì418 and World's Finest Comics #218‚Äì220 and #229. In 1975, Metamorpho appeared in 1st Issue Special #3, a brief anthology series consisting of one-shots. That issue was written by Bob Haney and illustrated by Ramona Fradon, Metamorpho's creators. Haney and Fradon had met at the 1974 San Diego Comic-Con, and while reminiscing, it emerged that both of them regarded Metamorpho as one of the features they'd most enjoyed working on, leading them to ask DC if they could do one more Metamorpho story together. Fradon later commented: \\"I think we both felt that Metamorpho was our baby. I never had an experience like I had working with Bob Haney on Metamorpho. It was like our minds were in perfect synch ... it was one of those wonderful collaborations that doesn't happen very often\\". After becoming a charter member of the Outsiders in 1983, and member of the European branch of the Justice League International, Metamorpho received his own four-issue mini-series in 1993. In 2005, DC Comics reprinted Metamorpho's early The Brave and the Bold appearances and the entirety of the 1965 series as one of the company's volumes of Showcase Presents. In 2007, Dan Jurgens launched the six- issue series Metamorpho: Year One. As part of a Wednesday Comics, Neil Gaiman wrote a 12-page Metamorpho story that Mike Allred illustrated. In 2016 he starred in a new comic book series titled DC's Legends of Tomorrow. Fictional character biography Rex Mason is an adventurer who is hired by Stagg Enterprises CEO, Simon Stagg, to retrieve a rare Egyptian artifact, the Orb of Ra. Shortly after hiring him, Simon Stagg learns that Mason has been dating his daughter, Sapphire Stagg. This and other incidents begin to fuel in Stagg a dislike for Mason that ultimately leads to a plot to kill him. In an Egyptian pyramid, Rex Mason is knocked unconscious by Simon's brutish bodyguard Java and is eventually exposed to a radioactive meteorite from which the Orb of Ra was fashioned. A tremendous flare-up of its radiation transforms Mason into Metamorpho, the Element Man. He gains the ability to shapeshift and change himself into any element or combination of elements found in the human body. It is also established in his origin story in The Brave & The Bold #57 that Metamorpho is virtually invulnerable in his inert (untransformed) state, when Stagg, afraid that Rex is going to kill him, shoots him point-blank without effect. The Orb of Ra, however, has the same effect on Rex that kryptonite has on Superman. Thus Stagg continues to control Metamorpho using the Orb. Later, it is revealed that Mason is but one of many metamorphae. They were created by the sun god Ra, using the meteorite, to serve as warriors in his battle against the god Apep, \\"the serpent who never dies\\". Metamorpho, unlike most super-humanoids described in DC Comics, cannot assume a normal, fully human appearance, being no longer composed of flesh, blood and bone. As such, he regards his metamorphic powers as a disease and seeks a cure for his condition. Because he considers himself a freak and wishes only to be restored to his former human state, he rejects an offer of membership from the Justice League of America in JLA #42. Green Lantern attempts to change him back using his power ring, but due to a \\"yellow\\" component of the meteorite radiation, is unable to make him normal again. Metamorpho briefly has a crimefighting partner named Urania \\"Rainie\\" Blackwell, a woman who deliberately exposed herself to the Orb to gain its powers. She calls herself Element Girl (nicknamed \\"the Chemical Doll\\") and works with him on a number of cases. Issues #16‚Äì17 were intended to show a new direction for the series, with Sapphire marrying a man named Wally Bannister and Metamorpho joining a mysterious Mr. Shadow to deal with an immortal queen. Bent on world conquest, the queen (an exact lookalike of Sapphire) marries Metamorpho. She later steps outside her mystic city and instantly ages 2,000 years. When Wally Bannister is murdered by Algon (a metamorph who has lived for centuries in a depowered state), Metamorpho is framed. Instead of coming to his defense against the false accusations, Metamorpho's colleague Mr. Shadow comes forth as an enemy. It is revealed that Mr. Shadow was attempting to enslave Metamorpho all along. Metamorpho is tried and convicted by a jury of rabble and is then executed by absolute zero, the first of what will become a series of multiple if temporary deaths. Element Girl revives Metamorpho, and Algon, the real murderer, is killed by molten lava minerals in an attempt to regain his burned-out powers. It is later learned that Mr. Bannister's murder was actually engineered by the villainous Prosecutor, who is then killed by an insectoid villain in a cocoon. At this point, issue #17 ends, and the story is never continued. Metamorpho reappears years later in The Brave and the Bold #101 (April‚ÄìMay 1972). It is revealed that Metamorpho had spent the period after the end of his own series immersed in a painful chemical bath concocted by Stagg in an attempt to cure his condition. Stagg retrieves him from this \\"cure\\" too early because he needs Mason to save his endangered daughter Sapphire. Metamorpho stars in a new backup series beginning in Action #413 (June 1972). There is no reference in this revival series to the events or characters of his previous two issues. Urania Blackwell, unreferenced since the end of the regular series, is later revealed to have ended her partnership with Metamorpho when her unrequited attraction to him became too much for her. Blackwell's powers are removed at her own request by Ra, resulting in her death; the episode, in Neil Gaiman's Sandman, involves Death. Death mentions Algon's death in passing, trying to convince Blackwell that she will not live forever. Outsiders Metamorpho spends some time working with the Outsiders. While in the despotically ruled nation Mozombia, Metamorpho is subdued and disassembled. The tyrant's forces keep him inert with a constant application of radiation. He is freed by Katana's indestructible sword, which had been latched onto a live electrical wire. While leaving Mozombia, the Outsiders' plane is shot down by the Bad Samaritan. Metamorpho and the others spend some time stranded on a deserted island, simply too far away from land to rescue themselves. Metamorpho perishes for the second time during the Millennium event. Doctor Jace, the scientific adviser to the Outsiders, has decided that life with the more logical Manhunters is preferable and she betrays the team; they fight back, but Metamorpho has been brainwashed into assisting Jace. He is killed in the resulting battle. He is again revived during the Invasion miniseries, when a gene-bomb set off by invading aliens affects his biomass. Justice League Metamorpho spends some time with the Justice League, including Justice League Europe. During this period he encounters Sapphire Stagg again. He becomes involved in a battle with the Metal Men, who have been tricked by Simon Stagg. His League friends, Rocket Red and Animal Man, are at the site of the battle, but are being detained by Java. At the conclusion of the battle, Metamorpho learns he had a son with Sapphire, but the baby boy's touch harms all but Sapphire and Metamorpho. When Java holds the baby, his arms melt. Metamorpho hands the baby over to Simon, who immediately fears he will be affected like Java was moments before and die. However, something in his genetic structure protects him, just as it did with Sasphire. Simon's stance softens and everyone is set free. Doc Magnus, the leader of the Metal Men, offers his services in creating new arms for Java. On the way home, Metamorpho's friends are puzzled as to how he knew Simon would be unaffected by the child. Metamorpho indicates that he hoped the baby would kill Simon. Later, Metamorpho has a romantic relationship with Crimson Fox, which is cut short by her apparent murder. His personal investigation of the incident uncovers multiple layers of lies and deceit. During his time with the team, while fighting the planet-smashing aliens called The Family, Metamorpho is hit by a powerful energy blast that destroys his body. He quickly re-forms in a totally different look. He will sport this new look until his next demise. Third death and return When the Hyperclan attacked the Justice League of America's orbiting base, destroying it, Metamorpho protects three of his teammates, Nuklon, Obsidian, and the original Icemaiden, in a giant, fluid filled ball. The intent is for them to survive reentry into Earth's atmosphere. The three make it, injured but alive, but Metamorpho does not. He is buried with solemn honors. He is temporarily resurrected by the wish- granting Id (fundamentally flawed because the wisher, his son Joey, only wished for him to be back rather than to be alive).

Powers and abilities Metamorpho can transmute his body to any of a wide variety of elemental compounds and form it to his will. Originally, he was limited to the elements which occur naturally in the human body. Over time, this limitation seems to have disappeared. He can alter the shapes and consistencies of these elements and combine them to form complex compounds. Rex can assume forms of gas, liquid or solid states. Metamorpho can also shape parts and portions of his body instead of the whole. He can form such complex shapes as a tank and a bicycle and such simple forms as a cloud or a spring. The nature of Rex's body provides him with natural body armor, offering damage resistance from blunt attacks and energy attacks.

First appearing in 1983, Katana is a samurai warrior whose skill with a sword allows her to fight for justice as a superheroine. Her tragic backstory includes the death of her husband, Maseo, whose soul becomes trapped in her blade, the Soultaker. Katana has been featured in various DC Comics superhero teams, including the Justice League and the Birds of Prey, but is most commonly associated with the team known as the Outsiders, a team of heroes hand-picked by Batman to act as his personal black ops team, handling riskier missions. In the 2010s, DC began to feature the character much more extensively in media adaptations of its comic books, including a recurring role in the animated series Batman: The Brave and the Bold and then a starring role in the series Beware the Batman. The character was adapted for live action in 2014, portrayed by Rila Fukushima during the third and fourth seasons of Arrow and returned in the final season. The character made her feature film debut in the 2016 film Suicide Squad, portrayed by actress Karen Fukuhara, which is part of the DC Extended Universe. The character has also been featured in direct-to-video animated movies and a number of DC Comics video games. Publication history Katana first appeared in The Brave and the Bold #200 (cover-dated July 1983) and was created by writer Mike W. Barr and artist Jim Aparo. In February 2013, Katana received her own series written by Ann Nocenti and with art by Alex Sanchez. This book is considered by DC as part of the \\"Fourth Wave\\" of New 52 titles. Katana lasted for ten issues. The final issue was released on December 11, 2013.Ching, Albert (October 15, 2013). \\"'Superman Unchained' Skips January; 'Vibe,' 'Katana' Ending\\". Comic Book Resources. Fictional character biography Becoming Katana was an average Japanese girl, save for her proficiency in the martial arts, a trait encouraged by her parents.Batman and the Outsiders #12 (July 1984), pp. 9‚Äì15. Reprinted in Showcase Presents: Batman and the Outsiders, Vol. 1 (DC Comics, Sept. 2007, , pp. 319‚Äì325). Two brothers‚ÄîMaseo and Takeo Yamashiro‚Äîboth proclaimed their love for her. While she liked both, she chose Maseo as her husband. Takeo \\"did not take this well\\" and refused to attend the couple's wedding. Maseo disowned his brother, who had joined the Yakuza and taken their mark of a large dragon tattoo across his chest. Tatsu and Maseo, mourning the deaths of Tatsu's parents, started a family of their own. Tatsu gave birth to twins, Yuki and Reiko. Meanwhile, Takeo rose through the Yakuza's ranks and indulged his \\"exotic tastes\\" for ancient weapons. He was presented with a pair of matching swords by General Karnz (later henchman to Baron Bedlam), one of which Takeo favored for its mystical properties. Takeo spent days preparing himself before taking both swords to the Yamashiro residence, demanding his brother duel for the \\"prize\\" of Tatsu. During the course of the struggle, a fire was started, and‚Äîwhile Maseo was distracted by his children‚ÄîTakeo killed his brother with the sword which would become known as \\"Soultaker\\". Tatsu arose just in time to see her husband die and engaged Takeo, gaining the upper hand and disarming him. Attempting to save her children, she heard her husband's voice coming from the sword, telling her they were already lost. Escaping with her life, Tatsu began training as a samurai under a master called Tadashi. After much time she graduated from his tutorship and left for America where she intended to use her talents to fight for justice. She took the codename Katana after the sword that she wielded, possessed for some time by the soul of her husband. Katana's classic appearance Becoming an Outsider Eventually Tatsu journeyed to Markovia, a small Baltic state, where she had tracked down Karnz, and she was successful in killing him, inadvertently implicating Black Lightning (coincidentally there with Batman) in her crime.Batman and the Outsiders #1 (August 1983), pp. 13‚Äì15. Attempting to rectify the misunderstanding by freeing Black Lightning, she encountered a young girl who was named Halo.Batman and the Outsiders #2 (Sept. 1983), pp. 5‚Äì6. The two joined up to rescue Black Lightning, Batman (himself captured due to a blunder by Halo), and Bruce Wayne's employee Lucius Fox from their captor, Baron Bedlam. Batman was himself in Markovia to rescue Lucius Fox, and having sought‚Äîand failed to gain‚Äîthe help of the Justice League of America, had resigned his membership in the Justice League. Inspired by the teamwork he encountered between Black Lightning, Katana, Halo, Geo-Force (Prince Brion of Markovia), and Metamorpho (also coincidentally present), Batman decided to form the Outsiders.Batman and the Outsiders #2 (Sept. 1983), p. 24. The team managed to end the Baron's tyranny in Markovia and moved to Gotham City, where they set up their headquarters (a former penthouse of Bruce Wayne, secretly the Batman). Tatsu became Halo's guardian and the two moved into the penthouse. At the same time, Takeo was still at large and had followed Tatsu to Gotham City. He attacked her and Halo at their home, overpowered Tatsu and switched swords with her. He left for Tokyo with Tatsu on his tail. The Outsiders followed Tatsu and offered to help her, despite her desire to leave them out of it. Takeo took the sword to his master, the godfather of the Yakuza, known only as the Oyabun. Performing a specific ritual, the Oyabun and Takeo called forth the souls that inhabited the sword and gave them corporeal form.Batman and the Outsiders #11 (June 1984), pp. 20‚Äì23. Among them were legendary mercenaries and assassins, but also Maseo, who was now a slave to the Oyabun. Katana‚Äî and the Outsiders‚Äî had to fight them all, but she was ultimately able to reclaim the Soultaker from Maseo. She was forced to kill her husband, and then took the opportunity to kill Takeo, finally putting some of her ghosts to rest. Maseo and those killed a second time by the Soultaker passed on to their eternal rewards, leaving Takeo trapped in the sword in his place. At one point the Outsiders split from Batman's leadership and took up residence in Markovia where they were funded by the Markovian crown (Geo-Force is a prince of the royal family). They became the official agents of Markovia and moved to the city of Los Angeles where they made their headquarters in the Markovian embassy, while retaining another secret HQ just off the shore. Although Tatsu had left her past behind, the Oyabun returned in her life and sent a tengu after her, with which he captured her. This mischievous spirit possessed her, and the Obayun was able to use her as an assassin. Her teammates in the Outsiders Halo and Looker were able to save her using other tengu and the tengu leader, who aided them in battle.Adventures of the Outsiders #34 (June 1986) Family debt After a while, the team disbanded after various tragic events surrounding Geo-Force's parents and Markovia. Nonetheless the Outsiders were forced to defend Markovia against the Manhunters, but during the fight Halo was knocked into a coma, saving Katana's life. Bounded by giri-ninjo (a debt of honor even unto death), Tatsu left the team so she could tend to Halo's wounds. During that time however, she was approached by a family member of her husband, who wished her to accompany the Suicide Squad on a mission to destroy a large hoard of weapons that was about to be sold to the Yakuza. She declined on the basis of her giri-ninjo, although she was willing to help if the need was truly desperate. That family member was later killed, and she went after the killer, the Daichi-Doku's Oyabun (of which her relative was a member), who did not wish to see the weapons destroyed and tried to stop the Suicide Squad. During that adventure, she saved the life of Bronze Tiger and Manhunter (Mark Shaw), making them honor-bound to her by giri-ninjo. Mark Shaw then assisted her in taking down the Daichi-Doku's Oyabun. The Oyabun committed ritual suicide and Katana stood by as his \\"second\\", ready to help with a blade strike so he could keep his honor. Returning to the Outsiders Eventually though the Outsiders re- formed and returned to Markovia. Instead of a peaceful reunion however, the team became trapped in a web of public relations that branded them outlaws. Although the charges were dropped eventually, the team was fractured. Halo died from an assassin's blast but was reborn in a new body, which put an immense strain on Tatsu's relationship with Halo. Katana joined a team with Geo-Force and Technocrat, taking the lead. She develops a mild romantic relationship with Joey Hong, an Asian associate of Guy Gardner.\\"Guy Gardner: Warrior\\" Vol 1. #39 (Feb. 1996) During a lone mission, her old mentor Tadashi sends Lady Shiva to claim Katana's Soultaker sword. Shiva confronted Katana, who was battling a gang of drug dealers. Katana slew many of them, but refused to kill the youngest member, something Shiva insulted her for. Shiva, renowned as the world's greatest assassin and fighter, killed Katana with her own sword. Katana returned to life after a trial by combat within her sword, which included confronting many of the souls of the people she had killed. Afterwards, she found her old mentor and took his life. The two splinter teams eventually reunited to take on more supernatural threats focused around the new team member Sebastian Faust. Katana and her friends suffered through the mental and physical tortures that Faust's father, Felix, put them through. Halo eventually freed them by destroying several of Felix's items of power. Soon after, the group broke apart. After disbanding, Tatsu kept her association with her old allies among the Outsiders (such as Black Lightning, Geo-Force, and Halo), and although they did not operate as an official team, they were always together during major crises. Her close ties to Batman also saw her fighting by his side, several times, notably during the Imperiex crisis and the Day of Judgment incident when Hell invaded Earth. The main battle against the villain, the rogue angel Asmodel, with the power of the Spectre, took place in New York. Katana personally protected Madame Xanadu who guarded the rest of Asmodel's power with a mystical shield. Katana's protection of Xanadu was assisted by Doctor Occult, Phantom Stranger, and Alan Scott. Later, Katana assisted Batman when he and Superman were declared outlaws. Katana was also called upon by Black Canary, together with other female mercenaries, in order to rescue Oracle from Senator Pullman. After Oracle was saved, Katana received a card, together with the promise of a favor if required. Katana later returned to assist Oracle in issue #108 alongside dozens of other agents. Katana as she appeared with the Outsiders in 2009 New Outsiders Later Katana joined a new team of Outsiders after assisting them in defeating a more powerful Sabbac. That team consisted of all new members, with the exception of Metamorpho who rejoined the team after Shift's demise. In Outsiders #42, Katana dons a new costume, as she felt it inappropriate to wear a costume based on Japan's flag, since the country had revoked her citizenship due to her membership with the controversial team. Later, Katana summons Sabbac to destroy Dr. Sivana's base with his Hellfire. Katana remains an active member of the Outsiders following the 2006 \\"One Year Later\\" continuity jump. Initially, the team is led by Nightwing, but later leadership transfers to Batman. Batman decides to 'test' Katana and the rest of the initial team, in order to design a better team. Katana is Batman's first official recruit. \\"Blackest Night\\" While escorting Killer Croc to incarceration, the Outsiders' vehicle is demolished by Maseo, Yuki, and Reiko, who have all been revived as Black Lanterns. Katana, believing that she has been reunited with her lost family, lets her guard down, but is saved from death by her teammates. Realising the truth, she draws her sword, preparing to fight her undead husband.Outsiders vol. 4, #24 When Katana stabs Maseo, Soultaker reveals to her the Black Lanterns' full intentions. Her attacks soon prove to be completely ineffectual against Maseo, who is instead destroyed by an outpouring of light from Halo, who also destroyed Katana's undead children.Outsiders vol. 4, #25. DC Comics. New 52 The events of the 2011 \\"Flashpoint\\" storyline led to The New 52, a relaunch of all of DC Comics' monthly books, and a reboot to the DC Universe in-story continuity.

DC Comics. and suggests that Katana take her place full-time on the team. Katana joins Black Canary and Starling as the third member of the Birds of Prey. Katana is described as a lethal fighter who has spent the last year waging war on the Yakuza clan that is responsible for the death of her husband. She is rumored to be mentally unstable due to her belief that her husband's soul, whom she often converses with in Japanese, resides in her sword.Birds of Prey (vol. 3) #2 After a number of adventures with the Birds of Prey, Katana leaves the group in order to keep an eye on a cult of assassins known as the Daggers.Birds of Prey (vol. 3) #15. DC Comics. She later accepts membership in Amanda Waller's new Justice League of America in exchange for information on her husband's murderers.Justice League of America (vol. 3) #1. DC Comics. When DC launched Justice League of America, they also launched the solo series Katana, focusing on Tatsu's abiding mission to track down her husband's killer. The series lasted 10 issues. After this, Katana made an appearance in Green Arrow #27 (2014), where she is told by the mysterious blind man Magus that the death of her husband relates to the Outsiders, the society formed of various weapon clans and connected to Green Arrow's new origin story. The Soultaker is worked into the Green Arrow mythology as the totem of the Sword Clan, which has parallels in the Fist, Mask, Shield, Axe, Arrow, and Spear Clans. Representatives from each of these clans make up the Outsiders, a secret society dedicated towards ending global corruption, but which is itself largely corrupt. Katana joins the Outsiders. In Green Arrow: Futures End #1 (2014), set five years later in one possible future, Tatsu is shown to still be a member of the Outsiders, which has developed a grudging relationship with Green Arrow, who rejected leadership of the Arrow Clan in the main Green Arrow series five years before. DC Rebirth Katana is being regularly featured in the Suicide Squad monthly-title, she is hired by Amanda Waller to work as a Co-captain of the Squad, led by Rick Flag, she is also present at the Justice League vs Suicide Squad event Later Became a member of Batman's Outsiders. Powers, abilities, and weapons Katana is a highly proficient hand-to-hand combatant and swordswoman, having studied martial arts as a child and later being trained by the samurai Tadashi. From her time with the Outsiders and Batman, she has also developed strong tactical skills. Katana's Soultaker sword, along with its non-powered twin, was forged in the 14th century by Muramasa, whose swords were said to be cursed and make those who were evil commit evil acts. It sometimes takes the souls of those it kills, storing them inside the sword, where they can engage in limited communication with whoever wields it. These souls and spirits can be freely reborn/reincarnated by the means of a sacred ritual, under which they serve their summoner, even if it is against their will. Its cutting edge is sharp enough to rend the Dilustel skin of Captain Atom and Major Force.Superman/Batman vol. 1 #4 In The New 52, the Soultaker is established as being the 'Sword Totem' of the Outsiders, meaning like the other totems, it supposedly bestows immortality and enlightenment upon its wielder, although some like Green Arrow are skeptical of the literal truths of these statements. In addition to the Soultaker, Katana often carries additional weaponry into battle.

Named after US President Abraham Lincoln, it is the city's largest public park and stretches for seven miles (11 km) from Grand Avenue (500 N) on the southOhio Street Beach to near Ardmore Avenue (5800 N) on the north, just north of the Lake Shore Drive terminus at Hollywood Avenue.Osterman Beach Several museums and a zoo are located between North Avenue (1600 N) and Diversey Parkway (2800 N) in the eponymous neighborhood. Further to the north, the park is characterized by parkland, beaches, recreational areas, nature reserves, and harbors. To the south, there is a more narrow strip of beaches east of Lake Shore Drive, almost to downtown. With 20 million visitors per year, Lincoln Park is the second-most-visited city park in the United States, behind Central Park. p. 25. The park's recreational facilities include baseball/softball fields, basketball courts, beach volleyball courts, cricket pitches, football/soccer fields, a golf course, lacrosse fields, rugby pitches, tennis courts, volleyball courts, field houses, a target archery field, a skate park, and a driving range. The park also features several harbors with boating facilities, as well as public beaches for swimming. There are landscaped gardens, public art, bird refuges, a zoo, the Lincoln Park Conservatory, the Chicago History Museum, the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum, the Alfred Caldwell Lily Pool, and a theater on the lake with regular outdoor performances held during the summer. History Couch Mausoleum in Lincoln Park, October 2013. This mausoleum is the only standing remnant of the cemetery that existed in part of Lincoln Park in the 19th century. Image from Harper's Weekly of people escaping the Great Chicago Fire by fleeing to the cemetery in Lincoln Park A concert in Lincoln Park circa 1907 In 1860, Lake Park (earlier, Cemetery Park), the precursor of today's park, was established by the city on the lands just to the north of the city's burial ground. Five years later, on June 12, 1865, the park was renamed to honor the recently assassinated President Abraham Lincoln. Added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994, part of the oldest section of today's Lincoln Park near North Avenue began its existence as the City Cemetery in 1843. This was subdivided into a Potter's Field, Catholic cemetery, Jewish cemetery, and the general City Cemetery. These cemeteries were the only cemeteries in the Chicago area until 1859. In 1852, David Kennison, who is said to have been born in 1736, died and was buried in City Cemetery. Another notable burial in the cemetery was Chicago Mayor James Curtiss, whose body was lost when the cemetery was added to the park. Throughout the late 1850s, there was discussion of closing the cemetery or abandoning it because of health concerns. In fall 1858, Dr. John H. Rauch MD suggested that the burial grounds were a health risk, which \\"might serve extremely well for plantations of grove and forest trees\\" that would be \\"useful and ornamental to the city.\\" The idea was dropped during the Civil War, but revived by Dr. Rauch after the war ended.William K. Beatty (1991) \\"John H. Rauch - Public Health, Parks and Politics\\" Proceedings of the Institute of Medicine of Chicago Vol. 44 pp. 97‚Äì118 By 1864, the city council had decided to add all the cemetery lands north of North Avenue to the park by relocating the graves. The cemetery sections south of North Avenue were also relocated but this land was left for residential development. To this day, the Couch mausoleum can still be seen as the most visible reminder of the history as a cemetery, standing amidst trees, behind the Chicago History Museum. Ira Couch, who is interred in the tomb, was one of Chicago's earliest innkeepers, opening the Tremont House in 1835. Couch is believed to not be the only person interred in the old burial ground in Lincoln Park. A plaque placed nearby states that \\"the remains of six Couch family members and one family friend are in the tomb.\\" Partially due to the destruction of the Chicago Fire of burial markers, it was difficult to remove many of the remains. As recently as 1998, construction in the park has revealed more bodies left over from the nineteenth century. Another large and notable group of graves relocated from the site of today's Lincoln Park were those of approximately 4,000 Confederate prisoners of war who died at Camp Douglas. Many prisoners perished between 1862 and 1865 as a result of the poor condition they were in when taken on the battlefield, or of disease and privation existing at the Federal prison. Although the camp was located south of downtown Chicago, near the stockyards, the remains were originally interred at the site of today's Lincoln Park. Today, their gravesites may be found at Oak Woods Cemetery in the southern part of Chicago. A one-acre (4,000 m¬≤) mass grave and a monument erected by Southerners and Chicago friends in 1895 memorializes these Southerners whose earthly remnants remain in the North. Author George Levy believes that remains of many of the Confederate prisoners are still to be found beneath what are currently baseball fields, the former site of the potter's field. An estimated 35,000 people total were buried in the park. From the 1860s through the 1950s the park expanded south and then north along seven miles (11 km) of Chicago's Lakefront. (See reference notes 1, 2 and 3). The establishment of public parkland along all of Chicago's Lakefront was a central tenet of the 1909 Burnham Plan for the development of Chicago. From 1912 until 1991, the park contained the Lincoln Park Gun Club. Another aspect of park history were the Young Lords Lincoln Park neighborhood sit ins and take-overs of institutions under the leadership of Jose Cha Cha Jimenez, protesting the displacement of Latinos by Mayor Richard J. Daley's urban renewal policies. Anti-Vietnam War protesters in Lincoln Park during the 1968 Democratic National Convention. The band MC5 can be seen playing It was also the scene of violent events that took place during the 1968 Democratic National Convention. These events transpired around the convention center, Grant Park, Old Town, and the park. Zoo, conservatory and museums Lincoln Park Zoo Nature Boardwalk Zoo Lincoln Park is well known for the Lincoln Park Zoo, a free zoo that is open year-round. Lincoln Park Zoo is home to a wide variety of animals. It includes big cats, penguins, gorillas, reptiles, monkeys, and other species totaling to nearly 1,250 animals. Two sections of Lincoln Park Zoo have been set aside for children. The partially indoor Pritzker Family Children's Zoo includes habitats of various North American wildlife. The Farm-in-the-Zoo is a working reproduction of a Midwestern farm containing horses and livestock such as pigs, cows, and sheep. At the Farm-in-the-Zoo, children can feed and interact with the animals and view live demonstrations of farm work such as the milking of cows. In 2010, the Zoo transformed the South Pond, to create a wildlife marsh habitat, with a Nature Boardwalk. Conservatory Lincoln Park Conservatory The Lincoln Park Conservatory offers year-round displays of plants from many different climates around the world. Today's conservatory was built in stages from 1890 to 1895. It consists of a vestibule, four display halls and fifteen propagating and growing houses. The vestibule and Palm House were built and opened to the public in 1892 and contain giant palms and rubber trees, including a 15 m (50 ft) fiddle-leaf rubber tree planted in 1891. In the Palm House, one can also find Garden Figure, a sculpture by Frederick Hibbard. The Fern Room or Fernery was opened in 1895. It contains plants of the forest floor, primarily a vast collection of ferns. The Tropical Room was originally called the stove house. Opened in 1895, it contained an assortment of tropical plants suspended from bark-covered walls. It is now called the Orchid Room and has a collection of approximately 25,000 natural species. The Display House is used for seasonal flower and plant exhibits. A docent program run by the Chicago Park District and Lincoln Park Conservancy provides free tours of the Conservatory and its outdoor gardens from 1-4 p.m. on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays and from 9 to Noon on Saturdays. Lily Pool The Alfred Caldwell Lily Pool in Lincoln Park is a National Historic Landmark listing. Located on Fullerton Parkway between Stockton and Cannon Drives, the Alfred Caldwell Lily Pool is an historic example of Prairie School landscape architecture. The Lily Pool was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and as a National Historic Landmark on February 17, 2006. The Lily Pool had originally been built to cultivate tropical water lilies in 1889. In the 1930s, the Works Progress Administration hired landscape architect Alfred Caldwell to redesign the pool in the Prairie School style.Mark Rosenthal, et al., Ark in the Park (University of Illinois, 2003) p. 66. From 1998 to 2002, the Lily Pool underwent an extensive restoration by the Lincoln Park Conservancy and the Chicago Park District, which earned the site its historic designations, and renamed the site after Alfred Caldwell. The Lily Pool is open seasonally from mid-April to mid-November from 7:30 a.m. to the earlier of dusk or 7:30 p.m. every day. A docent program run by the Chicago Park District and Lincoln Park Conservancy offers free tours from 1-4 p.m. on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and from 9 - Noon on Saturdays during operating season. Nature Museum Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum‚ÄìChicago Academy of Sciences, south wing, with tallgrass prairie overlook First established in 1857, the Chicago Academy of Sciences opened its most recent facility, the Nature Museum, in 1999. The Academy's previous museum building, the Matthew Laflin Memorial Building, was the Park District's first museum in the parks. The museum's exhibits include displays about the ecological history of the Illinois region, a live butterfly house, and a green home demonstration.Donna Vickroy. \\"Notebaert Nature Museum evolves\\". Daily Southtown. October 1, 2004. The butterfly house features over 200 species of exotic butterflies. The museum also offers educational programs for adults and children. History Museum Located at Clark Street and North Avenue, the Chicago History Museum (formerly the Chicago Historical Society) is dedicated to Chicago's human history. Perhaps among its most well-known possessions are Abraham Lincoln's deathbed and several furniture pieces from the room where he died in the Petersen House in Washington, D.C., as well as clothing he and wife Mary Todd Lincoln wore the evening of his assassination.Ted Knutson. \\"Believe it or not, museum collections tell a story\\". Chicago Tribune. July 27, 1984. LF16. The museum also houses Chicago's most important collection of materials related to local history from the Great Chicago Fire to the Young Lords in Lincoln Park. In addition to the exhibits, the museum continues to house an extensive research library which includes books and other published materials, manuscripts, paintings, sculptures, and photos. Recreational areas A postcard of the park circa 1900 View of Chicago from the South Pond bridge in July 2018 Facilities Lincoln Park runs from north to south through five Chicago community areas: Edgewater, Uptown, Lake View, Lincoln Park, and Near North. Along its seven-mile (11 km) stretch, Lincoln Park has many specialized spaces for recreational activities. The Park contains playgrounds; basketball, beach volleyball, tennis, volleyball courts, boating facilities; beaches; swimming; field and beach houses; running and bike paths; playing fields and pitches; archery, baseball, cricket, football, lacrosse, rugby, soccer, softball; a golf course; a driving range; skate park, and areas for horseback riding. Near Montrose Point is Cricket Hill, one of few sledding hills available in Chicago parks. Beaches There are seven public beaches for swimming, sunbathing, and beach volleyball along the park's 7-mile shoreline that are guarded during the summer months. The beaches from north to south are, Thorndale, Hollywood, and Foster in Edgewater; Montrose in Uptown; North Avenue in Lincoln Park; and Oak Street and Ohio in Near North. The first City of Chicago public beach, North Avenue Beach, opened in Lincoln Park in 1895. Golf The Waveland Avenue Golf Course (now Sydney R. Marovitz Golf Course) in the Uptown and Lakeview, Chicago neighborhoods section of the park provides a lakeside setting for the game. () Known for its challenging narrow fairways, it offers nine tees on a par-36 course. Further south, inland of Lakeshore Drive, is a driving range and miniature golf course. Boating There are three harbors in the Park providing marina and docking facilities for boaters: north to south, they are Montrose in Uptown, Lakeview's Belmont Harbor, and Diversey Harbor in the Lakeview and the Lincoln Park Neighborhoods. Montrose Harbor provides 630 dock facilities and is home to the Chicago Corinthian Yacht Club. Belmont Harbor provides 730 moorings, a fuel dock and a ship store.Belmont Harbor Information The Chicago Yacht Club has a Belmont station and the Belmont Yacht Club is located here. Diversey Harbor has 714 moorings and the Diversey Yacht Club provides a fueling dock.Diversey Harbor Information There is also a public launch at Diversey and the park also has rowing, sculling, and crewing channels. Chicago Lakefront Trail The Chicago Lakefront Trail (abbreviated as LFT) is an 18-mile multi-use path in Chicago along the coast of Lake Michigan. It is popular with cyclists and joggers. It is designed to promote bicycle commuting. From north to south, it runs through Lincoln Park, Grant Park, Burnham Park and Jackson Park.Chicago Park District Lakefront Trail Map COMFORTING A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY AT LINCOLN PARK OUTING - NARA - 551934.jpgPeople in Lincoln Park in 1973 LINCOLN PARK PLAYGROUND - NARA - 547188.jpgA playground in Lincoln Park in 1973 Fullerton ave Feb 2 2011 storm kids playing in the park.JPGChildren playing in Lincoln Park during a 2011 snowstorm 2006-06-03 3020x1700 chicago montrose harbor.jpgMontrose Harbor and other harbors provide marina and docking facilities Waveland Golf Course.JPGFirst tee at Waveland Golf Course Oak Street Beach Chicago.jpgOak Street Beach Wildlife North Pond Beaver in North Pond in 2014 The North Pond Nature Sanctuary (), located between Fullerton, Diversey, Stockton and Cannon, is a ten-acre pond that has become an important wildlife area. Historically the site was a dune, then a dumping ground, and an ornamental pond; it was converted in 1999-2000 into a natural area with a littoral zone that greatly improved the water quality by re-establishing native Midwestern ecology. The upland restoration of prairie, savanna, and woodland plants has included only top quality native species such as little bluestem, sky-blue aster, nodding wild onion, side-oats grama, butterfly weed, purple prairie clover, rough blazing star, wild quinine, prairie phlox, coneflowers, false dragonhead, northern prairie dropseed, showy goldenrod, rattlesnake master, shooting star, and wild bergamot. The North Pond Nature Sanctuary is notable as the site where Mayor Richard M. Daley and the US Fish and Wildlife Service signed an Urban Conservation Treaty for Migratory Birds in April 2004, making the city eligible for federal funds to restore habitat for the lakefront migratory pathway for birds. Restoration with native plants has drawn a great diversity of wildlife to this urban pond including many species of birds, turtles, frogs, and even a few beavers. Great blue herons, black-crowned night herons, green herons, mallards, wood ducks, song sparrows and woodpeckers can regularly be spotted at the North Pond Nature Sanctuary.

First landscaped and constructed with limited public access in the 1920s, under the leadership of the Chicago Academy of Sciences, its spring is supplied with city water to mimic a natural lake marsh environment, with attendant forest and meadow environments. Most of its area is entirely fenced around to preserve the habitat from human encroachment. Instead, a nature trail and a viewing platform are at its surrounding perimeter. During the 1940s, its Park District caretakers lost funding and the site was padlocked. In 1968, the entire site was almost bulldozed for golf course development but its Lake View neighbors, including Bill Jarvis, led a successful campaign to save and restore it. Today it hosts more than 150 species of birds, including six species of herons, like the black crowned night heron; wood ducks; woodcock; hawks; yellow-billed cuckoos; hummingbirds; thrushes; vireos; 34 species of warblers; and 18 native species of sparrows. In addition, small mammals such as rabbit, opossum, raccoon, and occasionally fox and coyote make their home there. In the Uptown neighborhood (4400 N; ), there is the Montrose Point Bird Sanctuary (including \\"The Magic Hedge\\"). During the Cold War, Montrose point, which juts out into Lake Michigan, was used by the United States Army as a Nike missile base. The Army camouflaged their missile launchers and barracks behind honeysuckle hedges. When the Army left in the 1970s, bird watchers noticed how the honeysuckle attracted birds. They successfully lobbied the park district for a new preserve. After extensive replanting, the site supports woodland, tall prairie, and lake dune habitat that annually attracts tens of thousands of migratory birds of more than 300 different species. Public art Lincoln Park is known for its statuary, being referred to as \\"Chicago's outdoor Statuary Hall\\" by WBEZ. Abraham Lincoln: The Man is a famous standing Lincoln statue in Lincoln Park by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, the same sculptor who created Abraham Lincoln: The Head of State in Grant Park. Replicas of Lincoln Park's Standing Lincoln can be found at Lincoln's tomb, Springfield and in Parliament Square, London. The statue is located at Dearborn Street and North Avenue. It was fully restored in 1989 by the Lincoln Park Conservancy's Adopt-A-Monument Program, and 8,200 square feet of formal gardens were added in front of the monument. The only other person immortalized by statues in both Grant and Lincoln parks is Alexander Hamilton; the statue of Hamilton was sculpted by John Angel. Just as there is an Abraham Lincoln statue in Grant Park, there is a massive memorial to Ulysses S. Grant in Lincoln Park overlooking Cannon Drive. The sculpture was created in 1891 by Louis Rebisso. The statue of Hans Christian Andersen by Johannes Gelert (1896) on Stockton Drive near Webster Avenue provides a tribute to the Danish storyteller. The Eugene Field Memorial (1922) designed by Edward McCartan remembers the Chicago Daily News columnist and poet who wrote \\"Little Boy Blue\\" and \\"Winken, Blinken, and Nod.\\" William Ordway Partridge's statue of William Shakespeare (1894) provides a third great story- teller in Lincoln Park. This seated Shakespeare includes a lap for children to climb onto. A bust of Sir Georg Solti, a conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, was also situated in the Lincoln Park Conservatory's formal garden until its relocation to Grant Park in 2006. Statues honoring the German poets Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller can also be found in Lincoln Park. The large Goethe statue is located near Diversey Parkway and Stockton Drive. The smaller Schiller statue is located near the western entrance to the zoo. Cyrus Edwin Dallin's 1890 A Signal of Peace is exhibited at the park. At Addison Street stands a totem pole depicting Kwanusila the Thunderbird. A statue of John Peter Altgeld (1915), the nineteenth-century Illinois Governor who pardoned the men convicted in the Haymarket affair bombing, can be seen just south of Diversey. This statue was created by Gutzon Borglum and unveiled on September 6 (Labor Day), 1915. Borglum went on to create the Mount Rushmore National Memorial.

It lies in the constellation Canes Venatici, and was the first galaxy to be classified as a spiral galaxy. Its distance is estimated to be 23 million light-years away from Earth. The galaxy and its companion, NGC 5195, are easily observed by amateur astronomers, and the two galaxies may be seen with binoculars. The Whirlpool Galaxy has been extensively observed by professional astronomers, who study it to understand galaxy structure (particularly structure associated with the spiral arms) and galaxy interactions. Discovery Lord Rosse in 1845 What later became known as the Whirlpool Galaxy was discovered on October 13, 1773, by Charles Messier while hunting for objects that could confuse comet hunters, and was designated in Messier's catalogue as M51. Its companion galaxy, NGC 5195, was discovered in 1781 by Pierre M√©chain, although it was not known whether it was interacting or merely another galaxy passing at a distance. In 1845, William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, employing a reflecting telescope at Birr Castle, Ireland, found that the Whirlpool possessed a spiral structure, the first \\"nebula\\" to be known to have one.Rosse revealed the spiral structure of Whirlpool galaxy (M51) at the 1845 meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Rosse's illustration of M51 was reproduced in J.P. Nichol's book of 1846. Rosse's illustration of the Whirlpool galaxy appears on the plate that immediately precedes p. 23. These \\"spiral nebulae\\" were not recognized as galaxies until Edwin Hubble was able to observe Cepheid variables in some of these spiral nebulae, which provided evidence that they were so far away that they must be entirely separate galaxies even though they are seen close together. The advent of radio astronomy and subsequent radio images of M51 unequivocally demonstrated that the Whirlpool and its companion galaxy are indeed interacting. Sometimes the designation M51 is used to refer to the pair of galaxies, in which case the individual galaxies may be referred to as M51a (NGC 5194) and M51b (NGC 5195). Visual appearance The image of the Whirlpool Galaxy in visible light (left) and infrared light (right) Located within the constellation Canes Venatici, M51 is found by following the easternmost star of the Big Dipper, Eta Ursae Majoris, and going 3.5¬∞ southwest. Its declination is +47¬∞, making it a circumpolar for observers located above 43¬∞N latitude; it reaches high altitudes throughout the northern hemisphere making it an accessible object from the early hours in winter through the end of spring season, after which observation is hindered in lower latitudes. M51 is visible through binoculars under dark sky conditions, and it can be resolved in detail with modern amateur telescopes. When seen through a 100 mm telescope the basic outlines of M51 (limited to 5√ó6') and its companion are visible. Under dark skies, and with a moderate eyepiece through a 150 mm telescope, M51's intrinsic spiral structure can be detected. With larger (>300 mm) instruments under dark sky conditions, the various spiral bands are apparent with HII regions visible, and M51 can be seen to be attached to M51B. As is usual for galaxies, the true extent of its structure can only be gathered from inspecting photographs; long exposures reveal a large nebula extending beyond the visible circular appearance. In 1984, thanks to the high- speed detector‚Äîthe so-called image-photon-counting- IPCS‚Äîsystem‚Äîdeveloped jointly by the CNRS Laboratoire d'Astronomie Spatiald (L.A.S.- CNRS) and the Observatoire de Haute Provence (O.H.P.) along with the particularly nice seeing offered by the Canada-France-Hawaii-Telescope (C.F.H.T.) 3.60m Cassegrain focus at Mauna Kea summit in Hawaii, Hua et al. detected the double component of the very nucleus of the Whirlpool galaxy (article in Astrophysical Letters and Communications, 1987, vol. 25, pp. 187‚Äì204). In January 2005 the Hubble Heritage Project constructed a 11477 √ó 7965-pixel composite image (shown in the infobox above) of M51 using Hubble's ACS instrument. The image highlights the galaxy's spiral arms, and shows detail into some of the structures inside the arms. Whirlpool Galaxy ‚Äì Observed in Various Light Properties Whirlpool Galaxy lies 23 million light-years from Earth and has an estimated diameter of 76,000 light-years. Overall the galaxy is about 43% the size of the Milky Way. Its mass is estimated to be 160 billion solar masses. or around 10.3% of the mass of Milky Way Galaxy. A black hole, once thought to be surrounded by a ring of dust, but now believed to be partially occluded by dust instead, exists at the heart of the spiral. A pair of ionization cones extend from the active galactic nucleus. Spiral structure The pronounced spiral structure of the Whirlpool Galaxy is believed to be the result of the close interaction between it and its companion galaxy NGC 5195, which may have passed through the main disk of M51 about 500 to 600 million years ago. In this proposed scenario, NGC 5195 came from behind M51 through the disk towards the observer and made another disk crossing as recently as 50 to 100 million years ago until it is where we observe it to be now, slightly behind M51. Star formation The central region of M51 appears to be undergoing a period of enhanced star formation. The present efficiency of star formation, defined as the ratio of mass of new stars to the mass of star-forming gas, is only ~1%, quite comparable to the global value for the Milky Way and other galaxies. It is estimated that the current high rate of star formation can last no more than another 100 million years or so. Transient events Three supernovae have been observed in the Whirlpool Galaxy: In 1994, SN 1994I was observed in the Whirlpool Galaxy. It was classified as type Ic, indicating that its progenitor star was very massive and had already shed much of its mass, and its brightness peaked at apparent magnitude 12.91. In June 2005 the type II supernova SN 2005cs was observed in the Whirlpool Galaxy, peaking at apparent magnitude 14. On 31 May 2011 a type II supernova was detected in the Whirlpool Galaxy, peaking at magnitude 12.1. This supernova, designated SN 2011dh, showed a spectrum much bluer than average, with P Cygni profiles, which indicate rapidly expanding material, in its hydrogen-Balmer lines. The progenitor was probably a yellow supergiant and not a red or blue supergiant, which are thought to be the most common supernova progenitors. On 22 January 2019, a supernova impostor, designated AT2019abn, was discovered in Messier 51. The transient was later identified as a luminous red nova. The progenitor star was detected in archival Spitzer Space Telescope infrared images. No object could be seen at the position of the transient in archival Hubble images, indicating that the progenitor star was heavily obstructed by interstellar dust. 2019abn peaked at magnitude 17, reaching an intrinsic brightness of M_{r}=-14.9. Planet candidate In September 2020, the detection of a candidate exoplanet, named M51-ULS-1b, orbiting the high-mass X-ray binary M51-ULS-1 in this galaxy was announced. If confirmed, it would be the first known instance of an extragalactic planet, a planet outside the Milky Way Galaxy. The planet was detected by eclipses of the X-ray source (XRS), which consists of a stellar remnant (either a neutron star or a black hole) and a massive star, likely a B-type supergiant. The planet would be slightly smaller than Saturn and orbit at a distance of some tens of astronomical units. Companion NGC 5195 (also known as Messier 51b or M51b) is a dwarf galaxy that is interacting with the Whirlpool Galaxy (also known as M51a or NGC 5194). Both galaxies are located approximately 25 million light-years away in the constellation Canes Venatici. Together, the two galaxies are one of the most widely studied interacting galaxy pairs. Galaxy group information The Whirlpool Galaxy is the brightest galaxy in the M51 Group, a small group of galaxies that also includes M63 (the Sunflower Galaxy), NGC 5023, and NGC 5229. This small group may actually be a subclump at the southeast end of a large, elongated group that includes the M101 Group and the NGC 5866 Group, although most group identification methods and catalogs identify the three groups as separate entities.

Created by Eugene Jarvis and Larry DeMar, it is a sequel to Defender which was released earlier in the year. It was the first of only three productions from Vid Kidz, an independent development house formed by Jarvis and DeMar. This sequel adds new ships to the alien fleet, including Firebombers, Yllabian Space Guppies, Dynamos, Phreds, Big Reds, Munchies and Space Hums. The Defender ship is now equipped with an Inviso cloaking device, which renders the ship invulnerable when activated, but has a limited charge. A Stargate transports the ship to any humanoid in trouble. There are two special stages: the Yllabian Dogfight, first appearing at wave 5 and recurring every 10 waves; and the Firebomber Showdown, first appearing at wave 10 and also recurring every 10 waves.  Legal issues  The Defender II name was used in some home releases, due to legal issues (according to the bonus material for Midway Arcade Treasures, Williams wanted to \\"make sure they could own the trademark\\" on the Defender name). The name Defender II has been used on many home ports and game compilation appearances, but not in arcades. The Atari 2600 port was originally sold as Stargate, but was renamed to Defender II for a later re- release. Gameplay The player flies a small spaceship above a scrolling, mountainous landscape which wraps around, so flying constantly in one direction will eventually return to the starting point. The player's ship flies in front of the landscape and does not contact it. The terrain is inhabited by a small number of humanoids. Enemy ships fly overhead. The goal is to destroy the enemies to prevent the humans from being captured. The player is armed with a beam-like weapon which can be fired rapidly in a long horizontal line ahead of the spaceship, and also has a limited supply of smart bombs, which can destroy every enemy on the screen. The player also has a limited supply of \\"Inviso\\" cloaking energy, which makes the ship invisible, and able to destroy any ships it comes in contact with. At the top of the screen is a mini-map, which displays the positions of all aliens and humans on the landscape. Aliens The aliens in Stargate. Most of the names of the new types are inside jokes. There are fifteen types of aliens: *Lander - The primary enemy on every level. Landers teleport into the level in staggered waves, and attempt to capture humanoids by descending upon them and dragging them into the air; if they make it to the top of the screen with a human, the two fuse together into a more dangerous Mutant. Landers can fire projectiles at the player. *Mutant - A mutated Lander. Mutants home in on the player at constant speed, firing projectiles. They move erratically, making them difficult to shoot. *Baiter - A flat, iridescent spacecraft that teleports in if the player is taking too long to complete a level. Homes in on the player and attempts to match their speed, whilst firing accurate projectiles. A difficult opponent due to its unbeatable speed and tiny horizontal cross- section, which makes it very hard to shoot. *Bomber - A box-shaped alien that lays stationary mines in the air. *Pod - A star-like alien that bursts into a number of Swarmers when shot. *Swarmer - A tiny teardrop-shaped alien that moves very quickly in an undulating fashion. Difficult to shoot. *Firebomber - A rotating variation on the Bomber, which shoots high speed Fireballs at the player. *Yllabian Space Guppie - An undulating attacker, which attacks in swarms and homes in on the ship. *Phreds and Big Reds - Square aliens which look like they are constantly opening and closing their mouths. Similar to the Firebombers, they launch tiny versions of themselves called Munchies. *Dynamos - Diamond shaped ships composed of clusters of Space Hums, which periodically break off to attack the ship independently. Once all aliens (except Fireballs, Space Hums, Baiters, Phreds, Big Reds and Munchies) are destroyed, the player progresses to the next level. Humanoids The game starts with ten Humanoids inhabiting the planet. Landers will attempt to capture and fuse with them during play. To rescue a Humanoid from capture, the player must kill the Lander holding it while it is in the air, causing the Humanoid to drop. At low height Humanoids can survive the drop on their own, but if the Lander is killed at too high an altitude, the player must catch the Humanoid with their ship and return him to the ground, otherwise he will not survive the drop. A player's ship can carry as many Humanoids as are alive on that level. The Humanoids can be killed by the player's weapon just as easily as the aliens can, so careful aim is required when firing near them. If all Humanoids are killed, the entire planet explodes, leaving the player in empty space. This also has the unfortunate effect of turning every Lander into a Mutant, making the player's job very difficult. Every time the player completes 5 waves of enemies (i.e. at wave 6, 11, 16 and so forth), the planet (and all its 10 Humanoids) is restored. Scoring As well as the points gained by killing aliens, scores are also awarded for the following: *Humanoid falling back to the ground without dying: 250 points *Catching a falling humanoid: 500, 1000, 1,500, and 2,000 points, depending on number of humanoids carried at the time. *Returning a humanoid to the ground: 500 points *Humanoid surviving the level: 100 points per humanoid for 1st wave, 200 per humanoid on 2nd wave up to a maximum of 500 points from 5th wave onwards *End-of-wave humanoid bonus: If all enemies are destroyed and a humanoid is falling to the ground, the player receives a 2,000 point bonus if the ship is positioned at ground level directly under the humanoid so as to simultaneously catch the humanoid and place it back on the ground. If the player simply catches the humanoid in mid- air while above the ground, the wave ends with the player only receiving the 500 points for catching the humanoid. By default, the player receives an extra life, smart bomb, and Inviso energy every 10,000 points. This amount can be overridden when the machine is in maintenance mode. As in Defender, at 9,990,000, the same bonuses are given per enemy destroyed. Controls The control system of Stargate expands on that of the Defender arcade game. It has a joystick to move up and down, a 'Reverse' button to toggle the player's horizontal direction, and a 'Thrust' button to move in that direction. There is also a Fire button for shooting, a button to activate a smart bomb, a button to turn on the Inviso cloaking device, and a hyperspace button which teleports the player to a random position in the level, at a risk of either exploding upon rematerialization, or materializing onto an enemy or enemy projectile. The Stargate A central feature of the gamefield is the Stargate itself, represented by a series of concentric rectangles. The operation of the Stargate depends on the current game conditions. If a Lander is in the process of abducting a Humanoid, flying into the Stargate will teleport the ship to where the Humanoid is under attack. If more than one Humanoid is being captured, the ship will be taken to the Lander that is closest to the top of the screen. If a Humanoid is being captured while a Humanoid is falling to the ground, the ship will be taken to the Humanoid that is falling to the ground. Otherwise, entering the Stargate will teleport the ship to the opposite side of the planet. If the ship is carrying at least four humanoids, entering the Stargate will \\"warp\\" the game ahead a number of levels. This allows more advanced players to skip the easier lower levels and also get a great number of points, extra lives, smart bombs and inviso energy. Warping is only allowed in the first 10 levels and can be avoided (if desired) by flying into the Stargate in reverse so a player can instead continue in the current level. Inside jokes Stargate adds several new enemies to the lineup originally introduced in Defender. The names of most of the new creations are based on inside jokes. The alien race that is fought is known as the \\"Irata\\", being the name of Williams competitor Atari spelled backwards. One of the other new enemies is also named after a competitor, \\"Yllabian Space Guppies\\"; Bally Midway was a major competitor with Williams in both the video game and pinball markets. Another new enemy is the \\"Dynamo,\\" which breaks into several small \\"Space Hums\\"; this is in homage to the song Dinah-Moe Humm by Frank Zappa. Three new arrivals, \\"Phreds\\", \\"Big Reds\\", and \\"Munchies\\", vaguely resemble Pac-Man, a game released in the U.S. by Bally. The Immortals on the High Scores page has factory defaults that are demonstrative of various information. The #1 high score is held by the fictitious \\"Phred Williams\\" with 102181 points, indicative of the game's release date of October 21, 1981. The #2 and #3 high scores are held by \\"VID\\" and \\"KID\\" respectively, the Vid Kidz software development studio. The #6 high score is held by \\"LED\\", Vid Kidz co- founder Lawrence E. DeMar. The #9 high score is held by \\"EPJ\\", Vid Kidz co- founder Eugene Jarvis. Spot #13 is held by \\"SSR\\", pinball designer Steve Ritchie, who had helped with Defender. Other Immortal scores include other developers on the project, such as \\"SAM\\" at #7 for Sam Dicker, and \\"PGD\\" at #12 for Paul Dussault. Ports Ports of Stargate were being developed for the Atari 5200 console and the Atari 8-bit family of computers by Atari, Inc. programmer Steve Baker in 1984. The game was also ported to the Commodore 64, Apple II, and IBM PC. The Family Computer port developed by HAL (renamed Star Gate, later named Defender II for US release) seems to be related to their Millipede (renamed Milli-Pede, later named back to Millipede for US release) and Joust ports, as well as Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!, all of which were released around the same time. In particular; the title jingle for Milli- Pede/Star Gate/Joust are almost identical, the music played when Star Gate begins is a longer version of the opponent entrance music within Punch-Out!!, and the music played during Star Gate's intermission screen between waves is the same as the screen after a loss in Punch-Out!!. Legacy In July 2000, Midway licensed Defender II, along with other Williams Electronics games, to Shockwave for use in an online applet to demonstrate the power of the Shockwave web content platform, entitled Shockwave Arcade Collection. The conversion was created by Digital Eclipse. It is currently not freely available to be played within the shockwave web applet. As Defender II, the game is included in the 2012 compilation Midway Arcade Origins. In popular culture A Stargate machine is featured in the 3rd-season episode \\"Arcade\\" of the TV comedy series NewsRadio, in which it was referred to as \\"Stargate Defender\\". Eugene Jarvis, the game's creator, had a cameo role on the episode as \\"Delivery Guy #3\\".NewsRadio 3rd season DVD commentary for the episode \\"Arcade\\", and the ending credits of the episode itself (also on the DVD). Stargate and its predecessor Defender are featured as plot points in the podcast Rabbits. Stargate also appeared in the 1983 movie Strange Invaders.

However he began his naval career in Portugal as Jo√£o Dias de Solis, where he became a pilot in the Portuguese India Armadas. After leaving his home in Lisbon and the ship that he was going to sail as Pilot, in the same day of departure of the fleet (ship captained by Afonso de Albuquerque, in the 1506 armada of Trist√£o da Cunha, to India), accused of the death of his wife, he served as a privateer in French fleets for a short time, before serving, later, the Spanish Crown.Medina, Jos√© Toribio: Juan D√≠az de Sol√≠s.

It was laid out in the 1630s under the initiative of the speculative builder and contractor William Newton, \\"the first in a long series of entrepreneurs who took a hand in developing London\\", as Sir Nikolaus Pevsner observes.Pevsner, London: The Cities of London and Westminster, vol. I (The Buildings of England), (1957) 1962:55. The original plan for \\"laying out and planting\\" these fields, drawn by the hand of Inigo Jones, was said still to be seen in Lord Pembroke's collection at Wilton House in the 19th century,\\"Lincoln's Inn Fields\\", Old and New London: Volume 3 (1878), pp. 44‚Äì50. Retrieved 16 July 2010. but its location is now unknown.It is not mentioned in the modern literature on Inigo Jones. The grounds, which had remained private property, were acquired by London County Council in 1895. The square is today managed by the London Borough of Camden and forms part of the southern boundary of that borough with the City of Westminster. Lincoln's Inn Fields takes its name from the adjacent Lincoln's Inn, of which the private gardens are separated from the Fields by a perimeter wall and a large gatehouse. The grassed area in the centre of the Fields contains a court for tennis and netball, and a bandstand. It was previously used for corporate events, which are no longer permitted. Cricket and other sports are thought to have been played here in the 18th century. Charles Booth, Life and Labour of the People in London: red areas are \\"middle-class, well-to-do\\"; blue areas are \\"Intermittent or casual earnings\\", and black areas are the \\"lowest class...occasional labourers, street sellers, loafers, criminals and semi- criminals\\". History Lindsey House, 59‚Äì60 Lincoln's Inn Fields Lincoln's Inn was situated in the county of Middlesex. Up to the 17th century cattle were grazed upon the fields, which were part of the Holborn grassland named Pursefield and belonged to St Giles Hospital. In the report of excavations of 64 Lincoln's Inn Fields,Brederova, Barbora, \\"Post-Medieval urbanisation in Holborn: excavations at 64 Lincoln's Inn Fields, WC2\\". London Archaeologist, spring 2019, pp. 224‚Äì229 it is noted that one Katherine Smyth, the owner of the White Hart Inn on Drury Lane, leased the land from 1520. It then reverted to the Crown, and was used as pasture and occasionally for an execution. The use of the pastures meant that turnstiles were placed around the square to enable pedestrians to enter without the animals escaping. Shops and other businesses developed along these footpaths, and some of these alleys still exist ‚Äì the Great and Little Turnstile.. Schemes for redevelopment of the fields by Inigo Jones and Charles Cornwallis in 1613 and 1618 were unsuccessful. William Newton gained permission, however, to erect 32 houses in what became known as Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1638 for an annual fee of ¬£5 6s 8d. However, the building license was only given if the central area remained an outdoor space open to the public. Quarry pits were discovered in the excavations at No. 64 (see above), probably for building materials, in particular, gravel. In the fill of one was a fragment of a 'fuddling cup', a drinking vessel which made it deliberately difficult to drink from without spillage. When originally laid out, Lincoln's Inn Fields was part of fashionable London. The completion of the houses that surrounded it proceeded at a leisurely pace, interrupted by the English Civil War. In 1659 James Cooper, Robert Henley, and Francis Finch and other owners of \\"certain parcels of ground in the fields, commonly called Lincoln's Inn Fields\\", were exempted from all forfeitures and penalties which they might incur in regard to any new buildings they might erect on three sides of the same fields, previously to 1 October in that year, provided that they paid for the public service one year's full value for every such house within one month of its erection; and provided that they should convey the \\"residue of the said fields\\" to the Society of Lincoln's Inn, for laying the same into walks for common use and benefit, whereby the annoyances which formerly have been in the same fields will be taken away, and passengers there for the future better secured.\\"Charles Knight, History of London, quoted in Survey of London The oldest building from this early period is Lindsey House, 59‚Äì60 Lincoln's Inn Fields, which was built in 1640 and has been attributed to Inigo Jones.Colen Campbell reported this tradition in Vitruvius Britannicus, I, p. 5, and illustrated it in plates 49, 50.

Retrieved 22 May 2008. Newcastle House in 1754 Another seventeenth-century survival is now 66 Lincoln's Inn Fields, which was built for Lord Powis and known as Powis House. The charter of the Bank of England was sealed there on 27 July 1694. It was in 1705 acquired by the Duke of Newcastle (whereupon it became known as Newcastle House) who had it remodelled by Sir John Vanbrugh (following earlier work by Christopher Wren after a fire in 1684). It remains substantially in its form of 1700, although a remodelling in 1930 by Edwin Lutyens gives it a curiously pastiche appearance. As London fashion moved west, Lincoln's Inn Fields was left to rich lawyers who were attracted by its proximity to the Inns of Court. In this way the former Newcastle House became in 1790 the premises of the firm of solicitors Farrer & Co, which is still there: their clients include Queen Elizabeth II. The Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre was located in the Fields from 1661 to 1848, when it was demolished. This, originally called the Duke's Theatre, was created by converting Lisle's Tennis Court in 1695. The theatre presented the first paid public performances of Purcell's Dido and Aeneas in 1700, John Gay's The Beggar's Opera in January 1728, and Handel's final two operas in 1740 and 1741. Lincoln's Inn Fields was the site, in 1683, of the public beheading of Lord William Russell, son of the first Duke of Bedford, following his implication in the Rye House Plot for the attempted assassination of King Charles II. The executioner was Jack Ketch, who made such a poor job of it that four axe blows were required before the head was separated from the body; after the first stroke, Russell looked up and said to him \\"You dog, did I give you 10 guineas to use me so inhumanely?\\". Sometime after 1735 the Fields were enclosed within an iron railing, on account of the then Master of the Rolls, Sir Joseph Jekyll, being ridden over by a horse. An alternative version of the story claims that Jekyll was attacked for his support of an Act of Parliament raising the price of gin. From 1750 to 1992, the solicitors Frere Cholmeley were in premises on the north side of Lincoln's Inn Fields, after which their buildings were taken over by a leading set of commercial barristers' chambers, known as Essex Court Chambers after their own former premises at 4 Essex Court in the Temple. Essex Court Chambers now occupy five buildings, nos. 24‚Äì28 Lincoln's Inn Fields. Other barristers' chambers have since then also set up in Lincoln's Inn Fields, but solicitors' firms still outnumber them there. 57‚Äì58 Lincoln's Inn Fields In Charles Dickens' novel Bleak House, the sinister solicitor to the aristocracy, Mr Tulkinghorn, has his offices in Lincoln's Inn Fields, and one of its most dramatic scenes is set there. The description of his building corresponds most closely to Lindsey House. After a spell of being occupied by a firm of patent agents, Lindsey House has become home to the leading civil liberties barristers' chambers, Garden Court Chambers, together with the neighbouring building at 57‚Äì58, which includes some features designed by Sir John Soane, including a geometric staircase.Garden Court Chambers The London School of Economics and Political Science moved onto the square in 2003, taking the leasehold of 50 Lincoln's Inn Fields, on the corner of Sardinia Street. At the end of 2008, a new ¬£71 million state-of-the-art building housing the LSE's Departments of Law and Management (54 Lincoln's Inn Fields) was opened by the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh. Since then it has taken ownership of Sardinia House (2009), the former Land Registry building at 32 Lincoln's Inn Fields (2010), 44 Lincoln's Inn Fields (previously the home of Cancer Research), 5 Lincoln's Inn Fields (2016) and Nuffield House (2017), to expand to seven its portfolio of buildings on the square. Notable premises The former premises of the Land Registry at number 32 Aside from Lindsey House and Powis House, the north side of the square features Sir John Soane's Museum, home of the architect, at numbers 12, 13 and 14. On the same side, at number 7, is Thomas More Chambers, led by Geoffrey Cox QC MP.Thomas More Chambers Organisations with premises on the south side of the square include the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) and the Royal College of Surgeons (including the Hunterian Museum, in which are exhibited the intriguing medical collections of John Hunter). There is a blue plaque marking the home of the surgeon William Marsden at number 65. On the west side the Royal College of Radiologists has premises at 63 Lincoln's Inn Fields, and the London School of Economics and Political Science owns a number of buildings. Aside from the Royal College of Surgeons, the School will then own the entire south side of the square. There is a statue by Barry Flanagan, an abstract called Camdonian, in the north-east corner of the square. Also located at 67‚Äì69 is the Centre for Commercial Law Studies, the commercial law research and teaching centre of Queen Mary, University of London. Homelessness During the 1980s Lincoln's Inn Fields attracted many homeless people, who slept there overnight. In 1992, they were cleared out and fences were raised, and since the re-opening of Lincoln's Inn Fields with its new railings in 1993, gates have been locked every night at dusk.History of Lincoln's Inn Fields ‚Äì Camden Council During the 2008 Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Muslims attended the Fields at sunset to feed the homeless.Sarfraz Manzoor: How Muslim flashmobs can feed homeless people  The Guardian Nearest stations The nearest London Underground stations are Holborn, Chancery Lane and Temple References Further reading * Chancellor, Edwin Beresford, The Romance of Lincoln's Inn Fields, London: Richards, 1932 (2nd edition). * Plantamura, Carol, The Opera Lover's Guide to Europe, New York: Citadel Press, 1996. *Lincoln's Inn Fields, Old and New London: Volume 3 (1878), pp. 44‚Äì50. * Manzoor, Sarfraz. \\"How Muslim flashmobs can feed homeless people\\", The Guardian, 22 September 2008.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as an infielder from to , most notably as a member of the New York Mets, with whom he played in the 2000 World Series and was selected as a member of the National League All-Star team. Alfonzo's 29.7 wins above replacement (WAR) as a Met place him as the seventh most valuable player in franchise history. Alfonzo also played for the San Francisco Giants, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, the Toronto Blue Jays and Navegantes del Magallanes from the LVBP. After his major league career, he played in the Liga Mexicana de Beisbol in 2008 for the Tigres de Quintana Roo then, played for one season in the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) with the Yomiuri Giants in . When his playing career ended, Alfonzo became a coach and later, the manager of the Brooklyn Cyclones. In 2020, Alfonzo was inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame. Early life Alfonzo was raised in Soapire, Venezuela by Mercedes Porfiria, a preschool teacher, and Edgar Alfonzo, Sr., a truck driver. Alfonzo's older brother, Edgar, Jr., taught him to play baseball. Edgar signed with the California Angels in 1985 when he was 18 years old and Alfonzo was 11. Edgar sent his baseball paychecks back home so that their father did not have to spend time away from Alfonzo and the rest of the family driving a truck. Playing career New York Mets Alfonzo was signed by the Mets as an undrafted free agent in . That year he joined the Gulf Coast League Mets. The following season Alfonzo moved up and split time with the short season \\"A\\" Pittsfield Mets of the New York‚ÄìPenn League and Class \\"A\\" Florida State League St. Lucie Mets in . Alfonzo returned to St. Lucie the next season and played for them in . In , he was promoted to the Binghamton Mets of the Class \\"AA\\" Eastern League, and led the team in home runs and RBI. Alfonzo made his Major League debut on April 26, 1995. At the beginning, he was a semi- regular fielder, splitting time at second base, shortstop, and third base with several others. During his rookie season, Alfonzo spent most of his time at third base while accumulating a .310 batting average after the mid-season break. In and , he started regularly on third. After the 1998 season, the Mets signed third baseman Robin Ventura, and Alfonzo was forced to move to second base. While he was upset about the move at first, he became one of the best defensive second baseman in the league from ‚Äì. Alfonzo was part of the infield considered to be among the best infields in MLB history on a cover of Sports Illustrated, along with Rey Ord√≥√±ez, Robin Ventura, and John Olerud.Sports Illustrated Before the season, the Mets signed the aging Roberto Alomar, and despite Alfonzo's tremendous offensive and defensive contributions during the previous three seasons, he was forced to move back to third base. He remained strong defensively; however, he struggled on offense, and the Mets decided not to re-sign him. Alfonzo with the Mets on May 30, 1999 Alfonzo had his first opportunity to display his clutch hitting ability to a nationwide audience in the 1999 playoffs. After finishing in a tie with the Cincinnati Reds for the National League Wild Card, the Mets played a one-game playoff to decide who would go on to the division series. In his first at bat of the game, Alfonzo hit a two-run home run over the center field fence, providing the Mets with all the offense they would need as Al Leiter threw a complete game shutout. On the very next night, the Mets played the Arizona Diamondbacks in the first game of the Division Series. Facing the feared Randy Johnson, Alfonzo again homered in his first at bat of the game, this time launching a two-run shot to center field. In the ninth inning of the same game, with the score deadlocked at 4‚Äì4, Alfonzo launched a grand slam down the left field line to help seal the victory for the Mets. In , playing against the San Francisco Giants in the Division Series, Alfonzo hit a two-run homer in the ninth inning of game two, which would prove to be of immense importance as J. T. Snow launched a three- run homer in the bottom half of the inning to tie the game. The Mets would eventually win the game 5‚Äì4 in ten innings. In game three of the series, with the Mets trailing 2‚Äì1 in the bottom of the eighth inning, the Giants brought in their dominant closer Robb Nen, who had not blown a save since the All-Star break. Alfonzo responded by lining a ball down the left field line for a double to drive in Lenny Harris. Benny Agbayani would later homer in the thirteenth inning to win the game for New York. Alfonzo then batted .444 against the Cardinals in the NLCS, but batted just .143 in the World Series against the New York Yankees. Alfonzo's knack for clutch hitting had endeared him to many Met fans, who still consider him one of the all-time Met greats. Coming off two excellent seasons in which he batted .304 and .324, Alfonzo had every reason to expect a big year in 2001. He had his best power numbers in 1999 (27 home runs, 108 RBI, 41 doubles) and 2000 (25, 94, 40), and at 27, he was at an age in which many hitters have their best season. However, Alfonzo suffered from a variety of injuries, including sore right hand, knee, thigh and a back injury from years before, costing him playing time and lowering his stats to a .243 average, 17 HR and 49 RBI in 2001. He finished with a .308 average, 16 HR, and 56 RBI. He was signed by the San Francisco Giants as a free agent in the off-season. San Francisco Giants In , Alfonzo struggled for most of the first half for the Giants. He was hitting .216 with 27 RBI at mid-season, but he hit .306 with 54 RBI the rest of the way, and performed well against the Florida Marlins in the National League Division Series, when he hit .529 (9-for-17) with five RBI. He had the lowest range factor among Major League third basemen (2.46). Alfonzo enjoyed a slight career renaissance in hitting for his career average, although with reduced power numbers. But his career continued its downward trend in 2005 due to age, nagging injuries, and reduced playing time in favor of Pedro Feliz. Los Angeles Angels The Los Angeles Angels acquired Alfonzo in exchange for Steve Finley. As a member of the Angels, Alfonzo's playing time further decreased in favor of younger players. After hitting .100 for the season in late May, the Angels released Alfonzo, whose agent had gone public in demands for a trade for lack of playing time, on May 20. Toronto Blue Jays On May 26, 2006, Edgardo signed a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays and was soon called up to Toronto to help the Jays' injury- and error- riddled middle infield. He was released on June 12, after appearing in only 12 games for Toronto. Bridgeport Bluefish In July 2006, Alfonzo signed a contract with the Bridgeport Bluefish of the independent Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. Mets, second tenure After appearing in a small number of games with the Bluefish, Alfonzo's contract was purchased by the Mets on July 15, 2006. Alfonzo reported to the then-Mets Triple-A affiliate Norfolk Tides with hopes of making it back to New York. Long Island Ducks In February , Alfonzo returned to the ALPB, signing with the Long Island Ducks. Texas Rangers and Mexican Leagues On December 14, 2007, Alfonzo signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Texas Rangers. After getting reassigned to minor league camp, Alfonzo was released before the season on March 27, 2008 and signed with the Tigres de Quintana Roo in Liga Mexicana de Beisbol. On June 9, 2008, Alfonzo signed with the Long Island Ducks. Yomiuri Giants In February , Alfonzo signed a one-year contract with the Yomiuri Giants of Japan's Central League.Former Mets All-Star Alfonzo signs with Giants in Japan He was released by the Giants on December 2, 2009. Newark Bears In 2010 Alfonzo signed a contract with the Newark Bears, reuniting him with his former Mets teammate Armando Ben√≠tez. Charlotte Knights In 2012, the Chicago White Sox signed Alfonzo and assigned him to the Charlotte Knights. Coaching career Alfonzo began serving as the Bench Coach for the Brooklyn Cyclones in 2014 under Tom Gamboa. He originally coached home games and select road games in 2014, before coaching all games in 2015 and 2016. In addition to that role, he served as a roving instructor with the Mets. On January 5, 2017, they Cyclones announced that Alfonzo replaced Gamboa, who had retired from baseball.Happy Days Return! \\"Fonzie\\" To Manage Cyclones in 2017 - BrooklynCyclones.com Alfonzo led the Brooklyn Cyclones to a New York - Penn League Championship victory on September 10, 2019. This occurred 18 years to the day since the Cyclones won a championship game. The 2001 Brooklyn Cyclones were managed by his brother, Edgar Alfonzo. On October 17, 2019, the Mets informed Alfonzo that his contract to manage the Cyclones would not be renewed.Edgardo Alfonzo Will Not Return As Brooklyn Cyclones Manager Personal life Alfonzo's older brother, Edgar, played in the minor leagues for 12 seasons. He has managed the Kingsport Mets, Brooklyn Cyclones, Savannah Sand Gnats and St. Lucie Mets. Another brother, Roberto, also played in 70 minor league games in the Mets farm system in 1993‚Äì94. A nephew, Giovanny, was selected in the 21st round of the 2015 MLB Draft by the Miami Marlins. Another nephew, Edgar, Jr., also played minor league baseball.

Tibbon (, ), was a Jewish philosopher and doctor who lived and worked in Provence, later part of France. He was born about 1150 in Lunel (Languedoc), and died about 1230 in Marseilles. He is best known for his translations of Jewish rabbinic literature from Arabic to Hebrew. Biography He received a Jewish education in rabbinic literature from his father Judah ben Saul ibn Tibbon. Other teachers in Lunel taught him about medicine, Arabic and the secular knowledge of his age. Samuel ibn Tibbon married and had children, including a son, Moses ibn Tibbon, who also translated works from Arabic to Hebrew. Later in his life, he lived in several cities of southern France (1199 in B√©ziers, and 1204 in Arles). He traveled to Barcelona, Toledo, and Alexandria (1210‚Äì1213). Finally he settled in Marseilles. After his death, his body was transported to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and he is buried in Tiberias. Original writings In 1213, while returning from Alexandria, Samuel ibn Tibbon wrote on shipboard Biur meha-Millot ha-Zarot, an explanation of the philosophical terms of Guide for the Perplexed by Maimonides. When finishing his Hebrew translation of the Guide (originally written in Arabic), Samuel wrote an alphabetical glossary of the foreign words that he had used in his translation. In the introduction to the glossary, he divided these words into five classes: # Words taken mainly from the Arabic; # Rare words occurring in the Mishnah and in the Gemara; # Hebrew verbs and adjectives derived from substantives by analogy with the Arabic; # Homonyms, used with special meanings; and # Words to which new meanings were given by analogy with the Arabic. He gives also a list of corrections which he desired to be made in the copies of his translation of the Guide. The glossary gives not only a short explanation of each word and its origin, but also in many cases a scientific definition with examples. Samuel wrote a commentary on the whole Bible, but only the following portions are known: * Ma'amar Yikkawu ha-Mayim, a philosophical treatise in twenty-two chapters on Gen. i. 9. It deals with physical and metaphysical subjects, interpreting in an allegoric-philosophical manner the Bible verses cited by the author. At the end of the treatise, the author says that he wrote it in response to the propagation of philosophy among Gentiles and the ignorance of his coreligionists in philosophical matters. * A philosophical commentary on Ecclesiastes, quoted by Samuel in the foregoing work (p. 175), and of which several manuscripts are extant. * A commentary on the Song of Solomon. Quotations from this work are found in his commentary on Ecclesiastes; in Neubauer, \\"Cat. Bodl. Hebr. MSS.\\" No. 1649, 2, fol. 21; and in his son's commentary on the Song of Solomon. These make it evident that Samuel wrote this commentary, but its full contents are unknown. Samuel ibn Tibbon was an enthusiastic adherent of Maimonides and his allegorical interpretation of the Bible. He held that many Bible narratives are to be considered simply as parables (meshalim) and the religious laws as guides (hanhagot) to a higher, spiritual life. While such statements were not unusual in his age, adherents of the literal interpretation of the Bible, the anti-Maimonidean party (see Maimonides for more details), created strong opposition to the work. Translations Samuel's reputation is based not on his original writings, but on his translations, especially that of Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed in 1204. (An image of his work may be seen online at the World Digital Library.) (The Hebrew translation is Moreh Nevukhim). Opponents of Maimonides used a satirical title: Nevukhat ha-Morim, or \\"Perplexity of the Rebellious\\". Before finishing this difficult work, Samuel consulted Maimonides several times by letter regarding some difficult passages. Maimonides responded sometimes in Arabic; his letters were later translated into Hebrew, perhaps by Samuel. He praised the translator's ability and acknowledged his command of Arabic, a skill he found surprising in France. Maimonides gave some general rules for translation from the Arabic into Hebrew, and explained passages questioned by Samuel by writing in Hebrew. Samuel ibn Tibbon's translation is preceded by an introduction. He said that he wrote the translation because the Jewish scholars of Lunel had asked for it. As aids in his work, he used the Hebrew translation by his father (whom he calls \\"the Father of the Translators\\"), works on the Arabic language, and the Arabic writings in his own library. Samuel also prepared an index of the Biblical verses quoted in the Moreh. A new, modern edition of ibn Tibbon's translation was published in 2019 by Feldheim Publishers. Punctuation and paragraph breaks were added, as well as translation of difficult words at the bottom of the page. There is also an extended introduction, many new indexes and other additions. Characteristics of his works The distinction of Samuel's translation is its accuracy and faithfulness to the original. Some critics have been concerned that he introduced a number of Arabic words into Hebrew, and, by analogy with the Arabic, he gives to certain Hebrew words meanings different from the accepted ones. But generally the scope and success of his work are not questioned. Especially admirable is the skill with which he reproduces in Hebrew the abstract ideas of Maimonides, as Hebrew is essentially a language of a people expressing concrete ideas. When the struggle between the Maimonists and anti-Maimonists arose, Samuel was reproached for contributing to the spread of the ideas of Maimonides. His chief critic was Judah al-Fakhkhar. Samuel translated the following works of Maimonides: # A treatise on Resurrection under the Hebrew title \\"Iggeret\\" or \\"Ma'amar Tehhiyath ha-Metim\\"; # Mishnah commentary on Pirkei Avoth, including the psychological introduction, entitled \\"Shemonah Perakim\\" (the Eight Chapters); # Maimonides' \\"Thirteen articles of faith\\" (originally part of his Mishnah commentary on tractate Sanhedrin, 10th chapter) # A letter to his pupil Joseph ibn 'A·∏≥nin, Samuel also translated the following works of other Arabic authors: # 'Ali ibn Ridwan's commentary on the Ars Parva of Galen (according to Paris MS. 1114), finished in 1199 in B√©ziersSteinschneider, \\"Hebraeische Uebersetzung\\" p. 734 # Three smaller treatises of Averroes, under the title \\"Sheloshah Ma'amarim\\" (edited by J. Herez, with German translation: \\"Drei Abhandlungen √ºber die Conjunction des Separaten Intellects mit den Menschen von Averroes, aus dem Arabischen Uebersetzt von Samuel ibn Tibbon,\\" Berlin, 1869). Samuel translated these three treatises both as an appendix to his commentary on Ecclesiastes (see above) and separately (Steinschneider, ibid p. 199). # Yahya ibn al-Batriq's Arabic translation of Aristotle's Meteora, under the title \\"Otot ha-Shamayim\\" (also quoted under the title \\"Otot 'Elyonot\\"), translated on a voyage from Alexandria, between the two islands Lampedusa and Pantellaria. It is extant in several manuscripts. The preface and the beginning of the text have been printed by Filipowski (c. 1860) as a specimen. Samuel made this retranslation, at the request of Joseph ben Israel of Toledo, working from a single and bad Arabic translation of Batriq (Steinschneider, ibid p. 132.).

Often, the names Marine Drive and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Road are used interchangeably to refer to this 3.9km stretch. The road and promenade were constructed by late philanthropist Bhagojisheth Keer and Pallonji Mistry. It is a 'C'-shaped six-lane concrete road along the coast of a natural bay. At the northern end of Marine Drive is Girgaon Chowpatty and the adjacent road along links Nariman Point at southern tip to Babulnath and Malabar Hill at northern tip. Marine Drive is situated on reclaimed land facing west-south- west. Marine Drive is also known as the Queen's Necklace because, when viewed at night from an elevated point anywhere along the drive, the street lights resemble a string of pearls in a necklace. Marine Drive in evening. Marine Drive from Malabar Hill. The official name for this road, though rarely used, is Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Road. The promenade is lined with palm trees. At the northern end of Marine Drive is Chowpatty Beach. This is a popular beach famed for its Bhel Puri (local fast food). Many restaurants also line this stretch of the road. Further down this road lies Walkeshwar, a wealthy neighborhood of the city, also home to the Governor of Maharashtra. Most of the buildings erected by wealthy Parsis were constructed in an art deco style, which was popular in the 1920s and 1930s. Among the earliest art deco buildings on Marine Drive were the Kapur Mahal, Zaver Mahal and Keval Mahal, built between 1937 and 1939 for a total cost of 1 million rupees. Real estate prices along the Esplanade are high. Many hotels dot the drive, most prominent among them being the 5-star Oberoi (formerly the Oberoi Hilton Tower however reverted to the original name as of early 2008), The Intercontinental, Hotel Marine Plaza, Sea Green Hotel and a few other smaller hotels. Marine Drive is the preferred connecting road between the central business district located at Nariman Point and the rest of the city. Many Sports Clubs are also situated along the stretch of Marine Drive, including members-only clubs like the Cricket Club of India, adjoining the Brabourne Stadium, and Garware Club House, adjacent to the famous Wankhede Stadium, as well as others like the Mumbai Police Gymkhana, P. J. Hindu Gymkhana and Islam Gymkhana. Former singing superstar of the 1950s Suraiya lived in a building on the stretch known as 'Krishna Mahal' in the ground-floor apartment (as a tenant of Shah family) from 1940s until her death on 31 January 2004. The house was first taken on rent by her mother, Mumtaz Begum. Many other film stars, such as Nargis and Raj Kapoor, lived nearby in the 1940s and 50s. In 2012, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai announced that the entire road would be resurfaced, 72 years after it was originally laid.

He is currently the bullpen coach for the Washington Nationals. He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball from 1997 to 2013, appearing for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Colorado Rockies, Milwaukee Brewers, Atlanta Braves, Minnesota Twins, Chicago Cubs, San Diego Padres, New York Mets, Arizona Diamondbacks, Toronto Blue Jays, and Seattle Mariners. He later served as quality assurance coach for the Cubs. Although a light-hitting player, he was regarded as one of the best defensive catchers in Major League Baseball. Professional career Blanco began his professional baseball career in 1989 when, he was signed by the Los Angeles Dodgers as an amateur free agent. He didn't begin to play as a catcher until . After 7 years in the minor leagues, he finally blossomed in when he hit for a .313 batting average in 91 games for the Albuquerque Dukes of the Pacific Coast League. At the age of 25, Blanco made his major league debut with the Dodgers on July 25, 1997. He returned to play for Albuquerque in and was granted free agency in October of that year. In December 1998, Blanco signed a contract to play for the Colorado Rockies and won the starting catcher's role for the 1999 season. Hitting for a .232 batting average, he embellished his defensive credentials by leading National League catchers with 39 baserunners caught stealing. In December 1999, he was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers as part of a three-team trade. Blanco caught the majority of the Brewers' games in 2000, posting a .236 batting average with 7 home runs, 31 runs batted in. He led National League catchers with a 58.2% baserunners caught stealing percentage, the highest percentage since when Bob Boone also had a 58.2% success rate. His batting average fell to .210 in the 2001 season and, in March 2002, he was traded to the Atlanta Braves for Paul Bako and Jos√© Cabrera. While Blanco served as a reserve catcher with the Braves working behind Javy Lopez, he also became known as Greg Maddux' personal catcher, a role he inherited from fellow Venezuelan catcher, Eddie P√©rez. Although he only produced 22 runs batted in, he had 5 game-winning RBIs and provided solid defense, helping the Braves win the National League Eastern Division title. Blanco was the starting catcher for the Braves in Game 3 of the 2002 National League Division Series and was a late-inning replacement in Game 5 as the Braves were defeated by the San Francisco Giants. In January , Blanco signed a $1.3 million, one-year contract with the Braves. Blanco reacts after striking out in 2009, during his tenure with the San Diego Padres. The Braves repeated as Eastern Division champions in 2003 however, Blanco's batting average dropped to .199 and he was left off the post-season roster in favor of catcher Johnny Estrada as, the Braves lost to the Chicago Cubs in the 2003 National League Division Series. When the Braves assigned him to the Triple-A Richmond Braves at the end of the season, Blanco opted for free agency and, in December 2003, he signed a one-year, $750,000 contract to play for the Minnesota Twins. Blanco became a valuable member of the Twins when rookie catcher Joe Mauer was injured early in the 2004 season. He was credited for helping the Twins pitching staff with his game-calling skills, guiding them to the lowest team earned run average in the league. Twins pitcher, Johan Santana, gave Blanco credit for helping him win the American League Cy Young Award. He caught the majority of the Twins' games helping them to clinch the American League Central division title. Blanco posted career-highs with 10 home runs and 37 runs batted in, while leading the American League catchers with a 49.2% caught stealing percentage. He started all four games of the 2004 American League Division Series, hitting 1 home run along with a .250 batting average as the Twins lost to the New York Yankees. After failing to reach a contract agreement with the Twins after the season, Blanco opted for free agency again and, in December 2004 he signed a two-year, $2.7 million contract to play for the Chicago Cubs. He worked as a back up catcher to Michael Barrett although, many of the Cubs pitchers preferred pitching to Blanco as his 2005 catcher's earned run average of 3.58 was almost 1 run lower than the 4.45 average posted by Barrett. In the 2006 Caribbean Series, Blanco had a walk off double off the top of the opposing shortstop's head in the championship game to give the Leones del Caracas the series championship win over the Tigres del Licey. In the 2006 major league season, he hit for a .266 batting average with a career-high 37 runs batted in and, in November, signed a two-year contract for $5.25 million to remain with the Cubs. Blanco appeared in only 22 games for the Cubs in 2007, missing two months of the season due to a herniated disc. The Cubs went on to win the National League Central division although, Blanco did not appear in any post- season games. In 2008, Blanco hit a career-high .292 while serving as back up and mentor to rookie catcher Geovany Soto, who went on to win the National League Rookie of the Year Award. After the 2008 season, Blanco's option was declined making him a free agent. In January 2009, he signed a $750,000, one- year contract to play for the San Diego Padres. During the 2009 season, he was a pinch-hitter, late-inning defensive replacement, and a mentor for Padres starting catcher Nick Hundley. Blanco signed a one-year, 1.5 million dollar contract with the New York Mets on December 3, 2009. On May 8, 2010, Blanco hit a walk-off home run to help the Mets defeat the San Francisco Giants 5‚Äì4. Blanco signed a one-year contract on December 15, 2010 with the Arizona Diamondbacks. He played in 37 games, hitting .250 and was re-signed following the season. He played in 21 games in the 2012 season. Blanco signed a non- guaranteed contract on January 11, 2013 with the Toronto Blue Jays. Blanco made the opening day roster for Toronto as the batterymate to recently acquired 2012 NL Cy Young winner R.A. Dickey. Blanco and Dickey previously played together for the New York Mets during the 2010 season, and Dickey had said Blanco was \\"the best [Dickey's] had seen at catching the knuckleball\\". Blanco was designated for assignment on June 7, 2013, and released on June 10. He batted .184 with the Blue Jays in 15 games played, with no home runs or RBI. Blanco was signed by the Seattle Mariners on June 14, 2013 to be a mentor to Mike Zunino. In Blanco's first game with the Mariners on June 15 (against the Oakland Athletics), he hit a grand slam down the left field line. On July 25, Zunino broke his left hand, and Blanco began splitting the catching duties with recently signed Humberto Quintero. On August 1, 2013, Blanco hit his second grand slam since becoming a Mariner. This one also down the left field line, against the Boston Red Sox starting pitcher Ryan Dempster which gave the Mariners a 7-1 lead, but the bullpen allowed seven runs in the final two innings in an 8-7 loss. In 35 games with the Mariners, Blanco hit .125/.215/.240 with 3 HR and 14 RBI, while throwing out 6 of 16 would-be base stealers. He played in his final major league game on September 23, 2013 at the age of 41. He was designated for assignment on October 8, 2013 after the Mariners claimed outfield prospect Travis Witherspoon off waivers from the Los Angeles Angels. He elected free agency the next day. Career statistics In a sixteen-year major league career, Blanco played in 971 games, accumulating 615 hits in 2,761 at bats for a .223 career batting average along with 72 home runs, 298 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .288. Blanco's .994 career fielding percentage ranks 27th all-time among major league catchers. Although he was a light-hitter, Blanco had an extended major league career due to the value of his excellent defensive abilities. He has credited former catcher Mike Scioscia, who was the catching coordinator during his time with the Dodgers, with helping him develop his catching skills. Coaching Blanco signed a minor-league contract, with an invitation to spring training, with the Arizona Diamondbacks on December 13, 2013. He was released on March 31, 2014, and immediately re-joined the Diamondbacks as a coach. On November 22, 2014, Blanco was hired by the Chicago Cubs to be their quality assurance coach. He won the 2016 World Series with the Cubs as a coach. After three seasons as a Chicago coach, Blanco joined former Cubs bench coach Dave Martinez on the staff of the Washington Nationals as the team's bullpen coach. His hiring was announced November 15, 2017.

Originally the seat of the Anglican Church of Hawaii, it is now the home of the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Hawaii. It is affiliated with St. Andrew's Schools, which consists of the main girls' K-12 school, the coeducational Queen Emma Preschool and a boys' preparatory school (elementary). History Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma, his queen consort, were devout members of the Church of England led by their good friend Queen Victoria. At their request, Thomas Nettleship Staley was appointed bishop in 1862. Inspired to build a place of worship in the Anglican tradition, Kamehameha IV commissioned the construction of what would later become the Cathedral of Saint Andrew. However, the king died on the feast day of Saint Andrew in 1863 before ground-breaking. Kamehameha V, the king's brother, took over the project and laid the cornerstone in honor of his predecessor on March 5, 1867. The cathedral was designed by the London architects William Slater and R. H. Carpenter, and the building process was overseen by their chief assistant Benjamin Ingelow. The Cathedral of Saint Andrew was built in the French Gothic architectural style, shipped in several pre-fabricated pieces from England. The western facade has a window of hand-blown stained glass that reaches from the floor to the eaves, depicting the European explorers that visited the Hawaiian islands. There are only three other cathedrals in the Hawaiian Islands -- Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace, Saints Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox Cathedral of the Pacific of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America and the Co-Cathedral of Saint Theresa of the Child Jesus of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu. It is located on Queen Emma Street, between Beretania Street and Queen Emma Square. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Oahu on July 2, 1973 as site 73000663.

Variable-argument macros were introduced in 1999 in the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (C99) revision of the C language standard, and in 2011 in ISO/IEC 14882:2011 (C++11) revision of the C++ language standard.Working draft changes for C99 preprocessor synchronization ‚Äì http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2004/n1653.htm Support for variadic macros with no arguments was added in C++20.  Declaration syntax  The declaration syntax is similar to that of variadic functions: a sequence of three full stops \\"\\" is used to indicate that one or more arguments must be passed. During macro expansion each occurrence of the special identifier in the macro replacement list is replaced by the passed arguments. No means is provided to access individual arguments in the variable argument list, nor to find out how many were passed. However, macros can be written to count the number of arguments that have been passed. Both the C99 and C++11 standards require at least one argument, but since C++20 this limitation has been lifted through the functional macro. The macro is replaced by its argument when arguments are present, and omitted otherwise. Common compilers also permit passing zero arguments before this addition, however.Variadic Macros ‚Äì Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)Variadic Macros (C++)  Support  Several compilers support variable-argument macros when compiling C and C++ code: the GNU Compiler Collection 3.0, Clang (all versions),Clang source code change that mentions __VA_ARGS__ support (2006-07-29), note that Clang was open- sourced in 2007. http://llvm.org/viewvc/llvm- project?view=revision&revision;=38770 Visual Studio 2005, C++Builder 2006, and Oracle Solaris Studio (formerly Sun Studio) Forte Developer 6 update 2 (C++ version 5.3).Sun Studio feature comparison ‚Äì http://developers.sun.com/sunstudio/support/CCcompare.html GCC also supports such macros when compiling Objective-C. Support for the macro to support zero arguments has been added in GNU Compiler Collection 8, Clang 6, but notably not Visual Studio 2017.  Example  If a \`printf\`-like function were desired, which would take the file and line number from which it was called as arguments, the following solution applies. // Our implemented function void realdbgprintf (const char *SourceFilename, int SourceLineno, const char *CFormatString, ...); // Due to limitations of the variadic macro support in C++11 the following // straightforward solution can fail and should thus be avoided: // // #define dbgprintf(cformat, ...) \\\\ // realdbgprintf (__FILE__, __LINE__, cformat, __VA_ARGS__) // // The reason is that // // dbgprintf(\\"Hallo\\") // // gets expanded to // // realdbgprintf (__FILE__, __LINE__, \\"Hallo\\", ) // // where the comma before the closing brace will result in a syntax error. // // GNU C++ supports a non-portable extension which solves this. // // #define dbgprintf(cformat, ...) \\\\ // realdbgprintf (__FILE__, __LINE__, cformat, ##__VA_ARGS__) // // C++20 eventually supports the following syntax. // // #define dbgprintf(cformat, ...) \\\\ // realdbgprintf (__FILE__, __LINE__, cformat __VA_OPT__(,) __VA_ARGS__) // // By using the 'cformat' string as part of the variadic arguments we can // circumvent the abovementioned incompatibilities. This is tricky but // portable. #define dbgprintf(...) realdbgprintf (__FILE__, __LINE__, __VA_ARGS__) could then be called as dbgprintf (\\"Hello, world\\"); which expands to realdbgprintf (__FILE__, __LINE__, \\"Hello, world\\"); Another example is dbgprintf(\\"%d + %d = %d\\", 2, 2, 5); which expands to realdbgprintf(__FILE__, __LINE__, \\"%d + %d = %d\\", 2, 2, 5); Without variadic macros, writing wrappers to \`printf\` is not directly possible. The standard workaround is to use the stdargs functionality of C/C++, and have the function call \`vprintf\` instead.  Trailing comma  There is a portability issue with generating a trailing comma with empty args for variadic macros in C99. Some compilers (e.g., Visual Studio) will silently eliminate the trailing comma. Other compilers (e.g.: GCC) support putting in front of . # define MYLOG(FormatLiteral, ...) fprintf (stderr, \\"%s(%u): \\" FormatLiteral \\" \\", __FILE__, __LINE__, __VA_ARGS__) The following application works MYLOG(\\"Too many balloons %u\\", 42); which expands to fprintf (stderr, \\"%s(%u): \\" \\"Too many balloons %u\\" \\" \\", __FILE__, __LINE__, 42); which is equivalent to fprintf (stderr, \\"%s(%u): Too many balloons %u \\", __FILE__, __LINE__, 42); But look at this application: MYLOG(\\"Attention!\\"); which expands to fprintf (stderr, \\"%s(%u): \\" \\"Attention!\\" \\" \\", __FILE__, __LINE__, ); which generates a syntax error with GCC. GCC supports the following (non-portable) extension: # define MYLOG(FormatLiteral, ...) fprintf (stderr, \\"%s(%u): \\" FormatLiteral \\" \\", __FILE__, __LINE__, ##__VA_ARGS__) which removes the trailing comma when is empty.  Alternatives  Before the existence of variable-arguments in C99, it was quite common to use doubly nested parentheses to exploit the variable number of arguments that could be supplied to the function: # define dbgprintf(x) realdbgprintf x could then be called as: dbgprintf ((\\"Hello, world %d\\", 27)); which expands to: realdbgprintf (\\"Hello, world %d\\", 27);  References   See also  * Variadic function * Variadic template C (programming language) C++ ja:ÂèØÂ§âÈï∑ÂºïÊï∞ ","title":"Variadic macro"},{"id":"715386","text":"Location of the Chechen Republic in Russia Location of the Republic of Ingushetia in Russia Sunzhunsky District is the name of several administrative and municipal districts in Russia: *Sunzhensky District, Chechen Republic, an administrative and municipal district of the Chechen Republic *Sunzhensky District, Republic of Ingushetia, an administrative and municipal district of the Republic of Ingushetia See also *Sunzhensky (disambiguation) References ","title":"Sunzhensky District"},{"id":"715395","text":"Location of Amur Oblast in Russia Location of Tambov Oblast in Russia Tambovsky District is the name of several administrative and municipal districts in Russia: *Tambovsky District, Amur Oblast, an administrative and municipal district of Amur Oblast *Tambovsky District, Tambov Oblast, an administrative and municipal district of Tambov Oblast See also *Tambovsky (disambiguation) References ","title":"Tambovsky District"},{"id":"715396","title":"Alan Cunningham"},{"id":"715400","text":"Roger Leandro Cede√±o (born August 16, 1974) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball outfielder.

Career Signed by the Los Angeles Dodgers as an undrafted amateur free agent in , Cede√±o made his major league debut in . Cede√±o was slated to be the heir apparent to veteran Dodger All-Star outfielder Brett Butler. However, after four seasons of mediocre play with the Dodgers, he was traded to the New York Mets on December 1, 1998 in a deal in which the Dodgers obtained Todd Hundley. In the 1999 season, Cede√±o broke a Mets record by stealing 66 bases in a season (later broken by Jose Reyes). Besides his 66 stolen bases, Cede√±o would bat .313, have an on-base percentage of .396, and a slugging percentage of .408. These would all turn out to be career bests. Following the season, on December 11 the Mets traded Cede√±o to the Houston Astros as part of a deal to obtain Mike Hampton. In May 2000, Cede√±o broke his hand sliding headfirst into first base and would spend three months on the disabled list.Astros not letting headfirst dives slide in minors Following the season, Cede√±o would be involved in a December trade for the third consecutive year, this time going to the Detroit Tigers in a six player deal. 2001 would see Cede√±o bat .293 and steal 55 bases, although he led the American League by being caught stealing 15 times. That winter would be the fourth year in a row he changed teams, returning to the Mets via free agency. The next three seasons would show further declines in Cede√±o's stolen bases, 25 in 2002, 14 in 2003 and just 5 in 2004, while hitting in the .260s all three years. He was traded before the 2004 season to the St. Louis Cardinals for Wilson Delgado. Following a 2005 season that saw just 61 plate appearances, Cede√±o was released by the Cardinals.

He was son of Samuel ibn Tibbon, and father of the Judah ibn Tibbon who was prominent in the Maimonidean controversy that took place at Montpellier. * Judah ben Moses ibn Tibbon :A rabbi in Montpellier; he took part in the dispute between the followers and the opponents of Maimonides. He induced his relative Jacob ben Machir ibn Tibbon to support the Maimonidean party by pointing out that the anti-Maimonideans were the opponents of his grandfather Samuel ibn Tibbon and his grandfather's son-in-law, Jacob ben Abba Mari ben Samson ben Anatoli. In consequence of this, Jacob ben Machir ibn Tibbon protested against the reading of Solomon ben Adret's letter to the community of Montpellier, which nevertheless took place in the synagogue of that city on the following day, a Sabbath, in the month of Elul, 1304.

The monument's encircling bank and ditch are visible behind it. The Aubrey holes are a ring of fifty-six (56) chalk pits at Stonehenge, named after the seventeenth-century antiquarian John Aubrey. They date to the earliest phases of Stonehenge in the late fourth and early third millennium BC. Despite decades of argument and analysis, their purpose is still unknown, although an astronomical role has often been suggested. Whilst visiting the monument in 1666, Aubrey noticed five circular cavities in the ground and noted them in his records. These features were ignored or not seen by the later antiquarians to investigate the site, and it was not until the 1920s during the work carried out by Colonel William Hawley that Hawley's assistant Robert Newall identified a ring of pits he named in honour of Aubrey and his early survey. The depressions seen by Aubrey himself are more likely to have been different features from those that now bear his name. Mike Pitts in a 1981 article in Nature pointed out that the holes had been backfilled thousands of years before Aubrey visited the site.Pitts, M. W. (5 March 1981). \\"Stones, Pits and Stonehenge\\". Nature 290: 46‚Äì47. The presence of later cremation burials and sarsen stone chips in the holes' upper fills supports this. That none of the other antiquarians who visited the site noticed any such holes implies that they were not permanent features either. Pitts argues that they were more likely to be the cavities left by features that had recently been removed. He has suggested that perhaps further megaliths stood at Stonehenge which occupied these other holes and are now lost. The Aubrey holes themselves Twenty-five of the holes were excavated by Hawley in 1920 and seven more in 1924. In 1950 Stuart Piggott and Richard Atkinson dug two more Aubrey Holes which brought the total excavated to thirty-five, including one that Richard Colt Hoare may have encountered whilst digging beneath the fallen Slaughter Stone in the early nineteenth century. It was found that the pits were an average of 0.76m deep and 1.06m in diameter. Twenty-five of the pits contained later cremation burials inserted into their upper fills along with long bone pins which may have secured leather or cloth bags used to hold the remains. Their presence makes Stonehenge Britain's oldest cremation cemetery. Plan of Stonehenge 1 with the Aubrey holes shown as white circles. After Cleal et al. The pits appear to have been refilled with the freshly excavated chalk rubble soon after being dug as no weathering has been noted on the chalk sides of the pits. They may also have been dug out and refilled numerous times. The holes are in an accurate, 271.6m circumference circle, distributed around the edge of the area enclosed by Stonehenge's earth bank, with a standard deviation in their positioning of 0.4m. The circle they describe is around 5m inside the monument's bank. Twenty-one of the holes remain unexcavated and no reliable dating material has been recovered from the other thirty-five. The only available carbon date from the holes comes from charcoal in one of the later cremations. It gives the broad range of 2919‚Äì1519 cal BC. That sarsen stone chips have only been found in the upper fills of the excavated pits implies that the digging of the holes predates the megalithic phases of Stonehenge. From this stratigraphic evidence it is therefore likely that the holes were dug during the first phase of the monument, Stonehenge 1 (around 3100 BC) and were then reused for burials during Stonehenge 2 in successive centuries. By the time the standing stones of Stonehenge 3 were erected (around 2600 BC), the holes had fallen out of use. The positions of the holes are today marked at the Stonehenge site by white discs laid in the ground surface. Archaeologists number them 1 to 56 counting clockwise from the later Slaughter Stone at the eastern side of the north east entrance. Hawley reburied the human cremations he found, placing them in the backfilled hole number 7. These remains were re-excavated in August 2008 as part of the Stonehenge Riverside Project. A plaque dating from the 1935 reburial was uncovered at the site. The project was detailed in an episode of the PBS TV series Nova around the same time.https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/secrets-stonehenge.html Theories about the holes Many interpretations prefer an astronomical explanation for the purpose of the holes although this is by no means proved. It was thought that when the Aubrey holes were first dug, the only standing feature at Stonehenge was the Heelstone, which marked the point of the midsummer sunrise, viewed from the centre of the henge. The Heel Stone is now attributed to Stonehenge 3 and was therefore not contemporary with the holes. It has been suggested that the Aubrey holes were originally intended to be postholes containing timbers or stones but this is uncertain. Analogous timber circles at sites such as Woodhenge have influenced this interpretation; the positioning of the Aubrey Hole circle relative to the earth bank and ditch at Stonehenge is reproduced at similar sites with rings of timber postholes. That the holes appear to have been filled soon after excavation and then possibly redug does not exclude the possibility that they held timber posts which were replaced intermittently. No evidence of postpipes has been recovered with the holes although modern archaeological excavation techniques have not been applied to the pits. If the putative timbers were purposefully removed when they fell out of use, then even this evidence would be difficult to spot however. The lack of full documentation from the early Stonehenge digs in the twentieth century and the disturbance caused by the insertion of the later cremations during Stonehenge 2 have also added to the uncertainty over the function of the holes. In a survey of twentieth-century excavations at Stonehenge, English Heritage's Stonehenge in its landscape, archaeologist Karen Walker collated and studied the surviving records from all the earlier work on the holes and concluded that \\"Although the evidence is inconclusive, and will no doubt be the subject of continued debate, the authors are inclined to support the view that the Aubrey Holes held posts, which were removed, rather than burnt in situ or left to decay.\\"Cleal, R. M. J., Walker, K. E. & Montague, R., Stonehenge in its landscape. p107 (English Heritage, London, 1995) In August 2008, further excavation of Aubrey Hole 7 by Mike Parker- Pearson, Mike Pitts and Julian Richards led the archaeologists to suggest that the 56 holes held Welsh bluestones, since they are too shallow to be postholes. In fact the holes are identical in width, depth, and shape to the bluestones located elsewhere in Stonehenge.Mike Parker, Pearson, Stonehenge A New Understanding: Solving the Mysteries of the Greatest Stone Age Monument, p. 183 They are confident that the Aubrey holes belong to Stonehenge's initial phase of construction. Professor Parker-Pearson said: \\"It's very exciting that we have evidence for stones right from its beginnings around 3000 BC. That's almost 500 years earlier than anyone had thought.\\" Archaeoastronomy and the Aubrey Holes The astronomical readings of the holes are largely a product of the interpretation of them as being simple pits without any structural features. This approach has required finding an explanation which tends towards the theory that the holes were repeatedly dug, filled and redug and excludes possibilities relating to any possible timber posts standing in them. The theory that they may have been used to hold temporary markers for use in astronomical observations gained credence in the 1960s. An early attempt to analyse the positions of the Aubrey holes was undertaken by Gerald Hawkins a professor of astronomy at Boston University in the 1960s using an IBM 7090 computer. In his book Stonehenge Decoded, Hawkins argued that the various features at the Stonehenge monument were arranged in such a way to predict a variety of astronomical events. He believed that the key to the holes' purpose was the lunar eclipse, which occurs on average about once a year on a 346.62 day cycle. Lunar eclipses are not always visible as the moon may be below the horizon as it moves across the sky, but over 18 to 19 years (18.61 years to be precise) the date and position of a visible eclipse will return to its beginning point on the horizon again. As the motion of the moon's orbit also causes it to work its way across the sky on an 18.61 year cycle in what is known as the journey between major and minor standstill and back, the theory that this period was both measurable and useful to Neolithic peoples seemed attractive. Lunar movements may have had calendrical significance to early peoples, especially farmers who would have benefited from the division of the year into periods which indicated the best times for planting. 18.61 is not a whole number and so it cannot be used to predict an eclipse without precision equipment, using only crude marker stones or timber posts in a circle instead. Hawkins' theory was that three 18.61 year cycles multiply out to 55.83, which is much closer to an integer and therefore easier to mark using 56 holes. Hawkins argued that the Aubrey Holes were used to keep track of this long time period and could accurately predict the recurrence of a lunar eclipse on the same azimuth, that which aligned with the Heel Stone, every 56 years. Going further, by placing marker stones at the ninth, eighteenth, twenty-eighth, thirty-seventh, forty-sixth and fifty sixth holes, Hawkins deduced that other intermediate lunar eclipses could also be predicted. More recent examination, notably by Richard Atkinson, has proved Hawkins largely wrong, as it is now established that the different features at the monument that he tried to incorporate into many of his alignment theories were in use at different times and could not have worked alone, the lateness of the installation of the Heel Stone being the final nail in the coffin. Furthermore, the 56-year period is not in fact a reliable method of predicting eclipses and it is now accepted that they never repeat their date and position over three consecutive 18.61 year-long lunar cycles. Hawkins' theories also required strict observance of the phases of the moon which further complicated predictions using his model. In 1966 Sir Fred Hoyle examined the arguments in favour of an astronomical purpose for the holes and concluded that the 28 day lunar cycle could still have been indicated by moving a marker stone representing the moon anticlockwise by two holes every day, ending up with 56 holes in total. By moving another marker anticlockwise two holes every 13 days, which represented the Sun, an annual journey around the circle could also be made. Two further marker stones would also have had to be moved round 3 holes per year to represent the points where the moon (or rather its marker) crossed the Sun marker's path. Hoyle proved that this could have been used to produce a much more reliable method of predicting eclipses as whenever the moon and sun markers are directly opposite each other and the other two stones occupy those same opposing points, an eclipse can be guaranteed. This also has the additional benefit of not needing any standing stones to be present at the site. On astronomical symbolism several analysts from Gerald Hawkins to Anthony Johnson have noted that Plutarch reported that Typhon / Seth in Egyptian and Greek myth was identified as the shadow of the Earth which covers the Moon during lunar eclipses. Plutarch further records that the Pythagoreans symbolically associated Typhon with a polygon of 56 sides, hence the connection of 56 to lunar eclipses is explicit, at least for the Hellenistic era. Although less complex and romantic than Hawkins' 'stone age calculator' such a technique is certainly feasible if only in theory. Much more elaborate predictive practices have also been suggested for the holes although all these methods, including Hoyle's, require a high level of astronomical awareness and a grasp of some very abstract concepts including knowing where and when to first position the stones around the circle. It has also been pointed out by R. Colton and R. L. Martin that simpler methods exist, based on observing the position of each moonrise, which would have worked just as well and which would not require moving numerous markers amongst 56 holes. This diminishes the astronomical significance of the number of the Aubrey Holes and their circular arrangement and tends to suggest that any astronomical purpose for the site may have been no more than symbolic. According to the astrologers Bruno and Louise Huber the Aubrey holes were an astronomical abacus to mark the positions and calculate the movement of lunar nodes. Extra-astronomical interpretations Mike Pitts has asserted that the Aubrey Holes did in fact originally hold timbers and compares the site at this stage to Woodhenge, The Sanctuary and other Neolithic timber circles. Such a view contradicts the archaeo-astronomical view of the holes as being a unique predictive device. In fact, early Stonehenge may have been barely different from the other Neolithic timber circles of the British Isles which had varying numbers of postholes and orientations and could therefore not have been used for in island-wide eclipse predicting. The interpretation of such timber circles is unclear, although parallels were drawn with Native American totem poles by Stuart Piggott in a 1946 BBC radio lecture. A 50 cm high carved wooden figure found in the Thames Marshes in 1912 and carbon dated to 2460‚Äì1980 BCE has been used rather tenuously to support the theory of carved wooden posts serving a more terrestrial purpose. Another possible explanation for the holes, suggested by Richard Atkinson, is that they were excavated in turn in some unknown ritual involving a procession around the inside of the monument. Others have pointed out the significance of the 28 day human menstrual cycle and argued that the holes may have been fertility indicators. Alexander Thom calculated that the circle of holes had been laid out in a circumference of 131 of his megalithic rods although this number has no known significance. A recent CAD study of the holes has shown that a 56 sided polygon can be generated by the simple use of square and circle geometry. Aubrey Burl also notes that the azimuth of the Heel Stone, beyond the Aubrey Circle, marks the midpoint in the swing of the Moon between major and minor standstill points, at 51.3 degrees. The true purpose of the holes may never be known, although future excavation of the remaining twenty-four using modern archaeological techniques will certainly provide more information.

It is by far the largest species of spruce and the fifth-largest conifer in the world (behind giant sequoia, coast redwood, kauri, and western redcedar); and the third-tallest conifer species (after coast redwood and coast Douglas fir). The Sitka spruce is one of the few species documented to exceed 300 ft (90 m) in height. Its name is derived from the community of Sitka in southeast Alaska, where it is prevalent. Its range hugs the western coast of Canada and the US, continuing south into northernmost California. Description Foliage, mature seed cone, and (center) old pollen cone The bark is thin and scaly, flaking off in small, circular plates across. The crown is broad conic in young trees, becoming cylindric in older trees; old trees may not have branches lower than . The shoots are very pale buff-brown, almost white, and glabrous (hairless), but with prominent pulvini. The leaves are stiff, sharp, and needle-like, 15‚Äì25 mm long, flattened in cross-section, dark glaucous blue-green above with two or three thin lines of stomata, and blue-white below with two dense bands of stomata. The cones are pendulous, slender cylindrical, long and broad when closed, opening to broad. They have thin, flexible scales long; the bracts just above the scales are the longest of any spruce, occasionally just exserted and visible on the closed cones. They are green or reddish, maturing pale brown 5‚Äì7 months after pollination. The seeds are black, long, with a slender, long pale brown wing. Size More than a century of logging has left only a remnant of the spruce forest. The largest trees were cut long before careful measurements could be made. Trees over tall may still be seen in Pacific Rim National Park and Carmanah Walbran Provincial Park on Vancouver Island, British Columbia (the Carmanah Giant, at tall, is the tallest tree in Canada), and in Olympic National Park, Washington and Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park, California (United States); two at the last site are just over 96 m tall. The Queets Spruce is the largest in the world with a trunk volume of , a height of , and a dbh. It is located near the Queets River in Olympic National Park, about from the Pacific Ocean. Another specimen, from Klootchy Creek Park, Oregon, was previously recorded to be the largest with a circumference of and height of . Age Sitka spruce is a long-lived tree, with individuals over 700 years old known. Because it grows rapidly under favorable conditions, large size may not indicate exceptional age. The Queets Spruce has been estimated to be only 350 to 450 years old, but adds more than a cubic meter of wood each year. Root system Living in an extremely wet climate, the Sitka spruce has a shallow root system with long lateral roots and few branchings. Fire danger Despite the prevalence of Sitka spruce in cool, wet climates, its thin bark and shallow root system make it susceptible to fire damage. Taxonomy DNA analysis has shown that only P. breweriana has a more basal position than Sitka spruce to the rest of the spruce. The other 33 species of spruce are more derived, which suggests that Picea originated in North America. Distribution and habitat Sitka spruce forest in the Olympic Mountains, Washington Sitka spruce is native to the west coast of North America, with its northwestern limit on Kenai Peninsula, Alaska, and its southeastern limit near Fort Bragg in northern California. It is closely associated with the temperate rain forests and is found within a few kilometers of the coast in the southern portion of its range. North of Oregon, its range extends inland along river floodplains, but nowhere does its range extend more than from the Pacific Ocean and its inlets. Sitka spruce has been introduced to Europe as a lumber tree, and was first planted there in the 19th century. Sitka spruce plantations have become a dominant forest type in Great Britain and Ireland, making up 25% of forest cover in the former and 52% in the latter. Sitka spruce woodland is also present in France and Denmark, and the plant was introduced to Iceland and Norway in the early 20th century. Uses End grain on P. sitchensis plank Sitka spruce is of major importance in forestry for timber and paper production. Outside its native range, it is particularly valued for its fast growth on poor soils and exposed sites where few other trees can prosper; in ideal conditions, young trees may grow per year. It is naturalized in some parts of Ireland and Great Britain, where it was introduced in 1831 by David Douglas, and New Zealand, though not so extensively as to be considered invasive. Sitka spruce is also planted extensively in Denmark, Norway, and Iceland. In Norway, Sitka spruce was introduced in the early 1900s. An estimated have been planted in Norway, mainly along the coast from Vest-Agder in the south to Troms in the north. It is more tolerant to wind and saline ocean air, and grows faster than the native Norway spruce. But in Norway, the Sitka spruce is now considered an invasive species, and effort to get rid of it is being made. Sitka spruce is used widely in piano, harp, violin, and guitar manufacture, as its high strength-to-weight ratio and regular, knot-free rings make it an excellent conductor of sound. For these reasons, the wood is also an important material for sailboat spars, and aircraft wing spars (including flying models). The Wright brothers' Flyer was built using Sitka spruce, as were many aircraft before World War II; during that war, aircraft such as the British Mosquito used it as a substitute for strategically important aluminium. Newly grown tips of Sitka spruce branches are used to flavor spruce beer and are boiled to make syrup. The root bark of Sitka spruce trees is used in Native Alaskan basket-weaving designs.  Culture  Kiidk'yaas in 1984 A unique specimen with golden foliage that used to grow on Haida Gwaii, known as Kiidk'yaas or \\"The Golden Spruce\\", is sacred to the Haida Native American people. It was illegally felled in 1997 by Grant Hadwin, although saplings grown from cuttings can now be found near its original site.  Chemistry  The stilbene glucosides astringin, isorhapontin, and piceid can be found in the bark of the Sitka spruce. Sitka spruce trees with burls, Olympic National Forest, Washington Burls In the Olympic National Forest in Washington, Sitka spruce trees near the ocean sometimes develop burls. According to a guidebook entitled Olympic Peninsula, \\"Damage to the tip or the bud of a Sitka spruce causes the growth cells to divide more rapidly than normal to form this swelling or burl. Even though the burls may look menacing, they do not affect the overall tree growth.\\"  See also  * List of tallest trees References External links * Picea sitchensis - information, genetic conservation units and related resources.

It is Colombia's 4th busiest airport in passenger volume, with 5,600,000 people using the airport in 2016. It is the third largest airport in Colombia in terms of area and construction. The airport often serves as the alternate airport for Bogot√° - El Dorado Int'l Airport and other Colombian airports. Alfonso Bonilla Airport lies in the center of the wide and fertile Cauca River valley, which runs north - south between the Western and Central Colombian Andes ranges. It is approximately 5 hours flight from Santiago de Chile, 50 minutes from Quito, Ecuador, and about 3 hours 18 minutes from Miami airport. The airport has one 3.000m long runway, equipped with the following navigation aids: primary radar, secondary radar, ILS, ALS, PAPI, RVR, runway centerline lights, threshold lights, and taxiway lights. The airport has SEI IXSecurity measures protection. The Cali non- directional beacon (Ident: AS) is located off the Runway 02 approach threshold. The Cali VOR-DME (Ident: CLO) is located off the Runway 02 threshold.Cali NDBCali VOR Alfonso Bonilla airport is notable for being one of the very few secondary airports in Latin America that operates 24 hours a day. This is made possible not only by the year-round stable, consistent meteorological conditions but also because it is away from both Cali and Palmira. That distance frees it from any environmental/noise restrictions, allowing aircraft to take off and land at any time of day. Alfonso Bonilla Arag√≥n International Airport has non-stop flights to the United States, Spain, Ecuador, Panama and Peru. History On April 21, 1921 Ferruccio Guicciardi flew his Italian-made Macchi-Hanriot HD-1, (named \\"Telegraph I\\") from Guayaquil, Ecuador, to Cali, with stops in Quito and Pasto, Colombia. This was the first aircraft ever to land in Cali. He claimed the $9,500 peso prize offered by the Department of Valle and the Cali City Council to the first pilot who landed in the city. This event marked the birth of aviation activity in the capital of Valle del Cauca. SCADTA Following the war with Peru in 1932, President Enrique Olaya Herrera sought the help of SCADTA engineers and pilots to find a suitable site for an airport capable of providing air support to military operations. After evaluating several alternatives, the German pilot Herbert Boy chose an area called \\"El Guabito\\" because of its location, proximity to the city and an extension of Juanchito Antioquia Avenue. After leveling the land with bulldozers a fledgling Air Force Base and Air National Guard station were built and operations began on September 21, 1933. Eventually, the number of airlines operating from the airport grew to include TACA de Colombia and VIARCO SAETA along with the already established SCADTA Panagra. However, Panagra began looking for a suitable place for an airport in order to link South America with Panama through Cali, as well as its domestic flights operated by Avianca. To this end they acquired land in the municipality of Candelaria, 18 miles from the center of Cali. On April 17, 1947 the modern facilities at \\"Calipuerto\\" were inaugurated. The airport passed to the Colombian state in the 1950s and was subsequently taken over by the Civil Aeronautics Department in 1968. In 1946, the company VIARCO valle, under the management of Ricardo A. Deeb, implemented an expansion policy including the construction of its own airport in Cali. The airport would be open to all airlines in the country except Avianca. In November 1946, the Aviation Authority requested an inspection of the new \\"El Limonnar\\" airport, located in the Pasoancho area of the city. In early 1947, the works were completed at the airport, which was put in service equipped with the most modern facilities and equipment at that time. LANSA and other smaller companies also moved operations to this airport from the military airport at El Guabito, later renamed the Marco Fidel Suarez AFB. El Limonar was closed in 1954 following a merger between LANSA and Avianca and the subsequent transfer of operations to Calipuerto. The city of Cali, like Bogota, at that time had three active airports in operation. When the new Palmaseca Airport opened the old Calipuerto buildings and runways were adapted and expanded to house Cavasa, an agricultural and food products distribution centre. Palmaseca International Airport The history of the new airport is directly linked to the 1971 Pan American Games, which were held in Cali. The infrastructure required to host an event of this magnitude made both the local and national government agencies broaden their horizons and commit to building the long- awaited and much needed facility. The Civil Aeronautics Agency had already purchased a large plot of land from Hacienda Palmaseca in the neighbouring town of Palmira. The project was beset by operational and financial difficulties, and the central government had to inject a further US$35 million in order to complete the physical construction and meet international aviation safety standards. Furthermore, new roads linking the airport to the industrial city of Yumbo and the main Cali - Palmira highway were also built as part of the project. Palmaseca International Airport was inaugurated on July 24, 1971 during the government of President Misael Pastrana Borrero. It had 3000m long runway, taxiways, parking apron, and a main terminal building for domestic and international flights. The terminal was equipped with airline service counters, restaurants, shops, a small hotel and even a nondenominational prayer chapel for nervous passengers. Although some critics initially claimed it was unnecessarily large and expensive for the city's needs at the time, air operations and passenger numbers quickly grew, justifying the size and cost of the project. The electronic, communications and safety equipment at the airport was recognized when it was designated as the alternate for Bogot√°'s El Dorado Int'l. Airport. In June 1989 local authorities renamed the airport in honour of \\"Alfonso Bonilla Arag√≥n\\", a local civic leader and journalist who played a prominent role in the approval and construction of the airport. This decision proved highly unpopular with the people of Cali, and there were serious efforts made to reverse the decision. Even the Business Guilds and the Cali Chamber of Commerce formally requested that the government intercede and force the Civil Aeronautics Agency to change the name back to \\"Palmaseca\\".Escobar, Jaime. Aviacol.net Reform and Privatisation At the beginning of 1982, √Ålvaro Uribe V√©lez, Director of Civil Aeronautics, made the decision to decentralize the management of two important international airports: Palmaseca in Cali and Olaya Herrera in Medell√≠n. Palmaseca would be administered by a mixed economy company, proposed by the Permanent Business Committee of Valle del Cauca and the Cali Chamber of Commerce. The entity that would have to abide by the rules of public establishments would be 90% economically backed by state capital and 10% by private capital. The shareholders included Empresas P√∫blicas de Cali, Palmira, Cortuvalle, C.V.C and Corporaci√≥n Financiera del Transporte. This decentralization was never carried out and only years later the privatization process began In the mid-1980s, part of the international terminal satellite collapsed, causing many criticisms of the design and construction firms of the building. In 1986 Civil Aeronautics had to assume the reconstruction of the international terminal satellite, together with the reinforcement in the rest of the structure. The md 1980's saw the construction of the cargo terminal, the general aviation area and a new airport fire station. In mid-1989 the main runway was repaved, which had deteriorated along 700 meters of the 3000 total meters in length. The general aviation area was also built, which unfortunately soon became a clandestine center for drug trafficking operations. For this reason the Aeroclub del Pacifico decided to acquire a large plot of land near the Free Trade Zone, adjacent to the header 1‚Äì9 to build its new facilities with direct access to the taxiway. Years later the National Museum of Transport was built in that area, which is well worth visiting.

History  An early image of Pacific Union College's campus overlooking the Napa Valley Pacific Union College has had a total of twenty-three presidents. The first eight of these served while the school was still in Healdsburg. In 1983, Malcolm Maxwell became the first alumnus to lead PUC, serving for a record 18 years. Bob Cushman, the current president, took office in July 2017 after serving as the academic dean at Walla Walla University. Pacific Union College was founded as Healdsburg Academy in 1882 in Healdsburg, California in northern Sonoma County. It was renamed Healdsburg College in 1899. Sidney Brownsberger was its first President. It is the twelfth oldest institution of higher education in the state of California, and the second founded by the Adventist Church, the first west of the Mississippi River.Utt, W.

In 1933, Pacific Union College became the first higher educational institution affiliated with the Adventist Church to achieve regional accreditation when it was awarded accreditation by the Northwest Association of Secondary and Higher Schools. The year before, PUC had become the first school to receive denominational accreditation. Pacific Union College also was the first Adventist school to form international affiliations; it affiliated with what is now Avondale College in Australia in 1954. In 2006 the faculty, administration and Board of Trustees underscored PUC's commitment to undergraduate education by making a formal decision to remain a college and not change its name to university, as other small private colleges had done. This decision was based on the institution's commitment to quality liberal arts undergraduate teaching.\\"Our ninety-seven teaching faculty members are dedicated to undergraduate teaching and to quality academic programs, a dedication that was reaffirmed in the 2005-06 school year, when the president initiated a campus-wide debate on the question of whether PUC should give in to pressures to call ourselves a university, like many similar institutions. With near unanimity, the entire community‚Äîfrom the chair of the board of trustees to first-year students‚Äîsoundly declared its determination to remain (in spite of all temptations‚Ä¶) a college.\\"PUC Institutional (Re-accreditation) Proposal May 2007, p.1.

In the summer of 2006, PUC's Board of Trustees announced its intention to enlarge its endowment through the sale and development of a portion of its land holdings into an ecovillage. The initial plans called for 591 homes and improvements to local businesses and shops. In response to community input, the number of units proposed was later reduced by 200, to 391. The plan was abandoned in October 2010. In early 2014, there was a controversy when a long-time department chair announced his resignation in response to president Heather Knight, preparing to remove a 26-year, tenured professor in his department for \\"lectures on sex that administrators said clashed with church teachings.\\"Wilson, Robin (2 February 2013). Clash Over Professor's Lectures on Sex Tests Academic Freedom at Religious College. Chronicle of Higher Education. Her actions were viewed as a reinterpretation of the school's policy on academic freedom which were previously interpreted to allow variations from church teachings. Knight withdrew her threat to fire the professor but \\"doubled down\\" on her reinterpretation of academic freedom despite a major outcry from faculty, students and alumni. Academic Dean Nancy Lecourt stated that the conflict originated from tension between the school's commitment to promote the church and professors' freedom to teach, stating, \\"How do we get students thinking? We poke at them, we introduce them to new ideas, and we ask difficult questions... But how do we get them thinking without losing their faith?\\" Following the school's re-evaluation of academic freedom, a professor, Greg Schneider, stated, \\"This damages the fabric [of the school's academic focus], and it's going to take some reweaving.\\" Schneider, who had taught at PUC for 37 years, planned to retire soon and asked, rhetorically, \\"Can I still, with my whole being, communicate to my students that this is where you ought to be?\\" In June 2014, the College received a $2.4 million unrestricted donation from a local resident. It was described as the single largest cash gift in the college's history.

Adults burrow and hide under the roots of large trees, and can be found a considerable distance inland. As with other terrestrial crabs, they use modified gills to breathe air. Their shells help maintain the humidity necessary for gas exchange to function. Caribbean hermit crabs are both herbivorous and scavengers. In the wild, C. clypeatus feeds on animal and plant remains, overripe fruit, and faeces of other animals, including the Mona ground iguana, Cyclura stejnegeri. The West Indian top snail (Cittarium pica) shell is often used for its home, and the hermit crab can use its larger claw to cover the aperture of the shell for protection against predators. As with other species of hermit crabs, C. clypeatus may engage in \\"shell fights\\" and can emit a chirping noise when stressed. Typically, the Caribbean hermit crab's left claw is larger in size than its right claw and is purple in color. Female land hermit crabs release fertilized eggs into the ocean. The spawning (called \\"washing\\" in the English-speaking Caribbean) occurs on certain nights, usually around August. This species is one of the two land hermit crabs commonly sold in the United States as pets, the other being the Ecuadorian hermit crab. C. clypeatus has been confirmed to live as long as 12 years, and some crab owners have claimed to have crabs live up to 40 years.

They are usually much deeper than they are wide although truncation may not make this apparent. Although the remains of the timber may survive most postholes are mainly recognisable as circular patches of darker earth when viewed in plan. Archaeologists can use their presence to plot the layout of former structures as the holes may define its corners and sides. Construction using postholes is known as earthfast or post in ground construction. Parts of a posthole Although a very common structure, and one of the most basic found in archaeology, correct interpretation relies on being able to tell the often subtle differences that distinguish the parts of the posthole. The components of an archaeological posthole are listed in order of creation and, in ideal circumstances, the reverse order of their excavation. ;Posthole cut The cut that formed the hole. It is cut from the ground surface level at time of construction. The sides of the hole may be distorted by later pressure on the post (as in the left hand example of the image), or later disturbance. Only careful excavation will be able to distinguish between the original cut profile and any later distortion. The cut needs to be distinguished from the fill in any detailed stratigraphic analysis, in the same way that any pit fill has to post-date the cutting of the pit, even if by minutes. ;Dug up soil Soil excavated from the hole, usually sitting in a pile next to the hole ready for backfilling. Ideal sequence will be that the dug up soil will have material dug through first at the bottom of the pile, with material from deeper down on top of the pile. In optimal situations, the location of dug up soil can be detected adjacent to filled postholes, especially where subsoil differs markedly from the surface material. ;Post Normally a round or squared timber placed in the hole. Sometimes a stone may be set in the hole below the post to prevent the post sinking in soft ground or sticks and stones to keep the post properly aligned until it is filled. Many cultures charred their posts to slow down rate of decay in situ. This is sometimes mistaken for burning in situ. Posts may, in modern times, be soaked in creosote or other decay inhibitors or termite preventatives. The post may survive as an element or have decayed (a postpipe), or been removed. Even if decayed there should be a dark organic stain that matches the original dimensions and extent of the post. ;Posthole fill / Post packing The dug up soil goes back in the hole once the post is in place. Sometimes structural needs require that the hole is also packed with rocks or smaller sticks to keep the post in desired position. Ideally dug out material returns to the pit in its original stratigraphic order but inevitably mixing occurs so that ground layers and posthole layers are distinguishable. Logically not all of the contents of the hole will fit back once the post is emplaced, so remaining soil may be left in a pile or scattered. ;Postpipe or post mould The decayed buried section of the post that remains in situ. Some archaeologists prefer pipe where it is predominantly still organic material and mould where this has been replaced by sediment. ;Post void Where a pipe has been removed. This may be uncovered as a cavity, although this is rare and usually a combination of slumping of posthole fill and inwashed deposits fill the position of the post, which is usually termed post mould. ;Posthole This is the generic term for all of the archaeological evidence contained within the cut, particularly when seen in plan view, including any artefacts that have been introduced during the cutting and filling sequence. Procedure for excavating a posthole To excavate a posthole a series of steps must be taken. First, the postholes are sprayed with water to prevent them from drying out and to make the edges show up more clearly. The postholes then are measured to see where the widest point is (about halfway through). One half of the post hole and part of the surrounding soil is dug out in a rectangular shape until the bottom of the post hole is visible on the wall of the intact half. This wall is the profile wall of the post hole. The post hole is then measured of its width and height and the profile wall is drawn, with important features like rocks or bones being marked. Interpretation of postholes Postholes are different from stake holes in that the cut is dug for the post rather than created by the driving in of the stake. This means there is some voided space that has to be filled in once the post is in place. This material is post packing and is one of the main ways of differentiating postholes from stake holes in plan. The shape and structure of the contexts within a posthole can also shed light on past activity. If a post was purposely removed, then the action of rocking it back and forth leaves tell-tale evidence in the profile of the posthole which archaeologists can recognise. A post may have rotted in place leaving a postpipe or still be surviving (See the section in Fig 1). Archaeologists can use their presence to plot the layout of former structures as the holes may define its corners and sides. Postholes may also be dug on alignments of backfilled ditches where boundaries have been upgraded from simple ditch enclosures into structural ones. Dangers of posthole interpretation The relative frequency of postholes as a feature in most eras combined with a lack of good information on the phasing of postholes, which often occurs onsite due to horizontal truncation or a failure to spot postholes at the level they were cut from, can lead to a clutter of postholes that invites imaginative interpretations. The human mind seems quite capable of creating patterns and the temptation to see structures that are not there or tenuous at best is quite strong. It is considered good practice that supporting evidence from multiple sources on site like the perceived structures alignments with other features onsite should be taken into account before any hard interpretation is made as to whether postholes with no stratigraphic relationship to each other are truly associated.

The island is an open nature reserve managed by the Supporters of Tiritiri Matangi Incorporated, under the supervision of the Department of Conservation and is noted for its bird life, including takahƒì, North Island k≈çkako and kiwi. It attracts between 30,000 and 32,000 visitors a year, the latter figure being the maximum allowed by the Auckland Conservation Management Strategy. The name, MƒÅori for \\"tossed by the wind\\", is often popularly shortened to Tiritiri. MƒÅori mythology considers the island to be a float of an ancestral fishing net.  History   Human use  The first people to settle on the island were MƒÅori of the Kawerau iwi. Later, members of the NgƒÅti PƒÅoa moved to the island, like the Kawerau partly for shark fishing until about 1700, when the Kawerau regained control and remained until forced to retreat to Waikato in 1821 when Hongi Hika attacked from the north. There were two pƒÅ, Tiritiri Matangi PƒÅ and Papakura PƒÅ. European (PƒÅkehƒÅ) settlers arrived in the early 19th century. In 1841 NgƒÅti PƒÅoa sold the land to the crown as part of the Mahurangi Block. When the Kawerau returned, friction ensued as both peoples had a claim to the island. In 1867 the MƒÅori Land Court awarded title to the Crown. A lighthouse was constructed near the southern end in 1864, and remains in operation. In 1956, a xenon light source was fitted to the lighthouse, creating the most powerful light-beam achieved at the time by a New Zealand lighthouse. It had an output of 11 million candle-power and a range of 58 nautical miles, making it one of the most powerful lights in the world; most lights shone for 27 nautical miles.http://www.maritimenz.govt.nz/about/what-we-do/history-of- MNZ/timeline.asp#800_AD The island was farmed from the mid 1800s to 1971, when the lease expired. Management was then vested in the Hauraki Gulf Maritime Park Board.  Regeneration and sanctuary  The island was chosen as a unique and protected place to provide a public window for rare New Zealand native birds on the edge of a large city and it also lacked introduced predators such as mustelids which were present on the mainland. At that time, although the island was devoid of suitable habitat and food sources, the hope was that native forest would regenerate naturally. It became apparent that natural afforestation was happening very slowly because a forest can only grow at its margins, and the island was covered mostly with dense grass and bracken fern. A plan was formulated to establish a nursery to collect cuttings and seed in order to expand the small pockets of forest habitat that were left in some of the valleys. Pohutukawa was chosen as the main tree as it would eventually provide perches and roosts for birds who would then excrete the seed of the fruits that they had been eating, which would then germinate around the pohutukawa. Forest on Tiritiri Matangi The next intervention was eradication in 1993 of the Polynesian rat, known to MƒÅori as kiore, which was destroying seedlings and competing with birds for food. The kiore were killed by an aerial drop of poisoned bait, which was controversial due to its lack of planning and the effect on other wildlife. For instance, 90% of pukeko on the island were killed.Armstrong, Doug (1999). Tiritiri Matangi Island Restoration Programme - Kiore eradication. Massey University. Archived via WebCite on 21 April 2011. Eighty-seven species of birds have been observed on or near the island. Eleven native species have been translocated to the island as part of the ongoing restoration project.Tiritiri Matangi Ecosystem Restoration (from the Department of Conservation website) These are red-crowned parakeet (kƒÅkƒÅriki, Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae), North Island saddleback (tƒ´eke, Philesturnus rufusater), brown teal (pƒÅteke, Anas chlorotis), whitehead (p≈çpokotea, Mohoua albicilla), takahƒì (Porphyrio hochstetteri), little spotted kiwi (Apteryx owenii), stitchbird (hihi, Notiomystis cincta), North Island k≈çkako (Callaeas wilsoni), fernbird (mƒÅtƒÅtƒÅ, Poodytes punctatus), North Island tomtit (miromiro, Petroica macrocephala toitoi), and rifleman (titipounamu, Acanthisitta chloris). Non-avian translocations include 60 tuatara in 2003, Duvaucel's gecko in 2006 and a large insect wetapunga in 2011. Non-native species still present include the Australian brown quail. The success of the conservation project encouraged the creation of a number of similar projects around the Gulf, such as on Motuihe, Motuora and Motutapu. The closest land on the tip of the Whangaparaoa Peninsula, Shakespear Regional Park has recently (2011) also become a mammalian pest-free fenced sanctuary, increasing immigration of the birds on Tiritiri to the nearby mainland. Tiritiri Matangi wharf and ferry, day-trip passengers have just disembarked A ferry service runs from Auckland Ferry Terminal and Gulf Harbour, and guided tours are available. It is a popular destination for daytrippers, with trips often fully booked, attracting some 30,000 visitors annually, who enjoy an intensity of birdsong rarely heard on the mainland.

He previously played college football for Morgan State University. After being selected with the 321st pick in the 1953 NFL Draft, he appeared in 162 games for the Giants, missing only four games in a 13-year career. In his prime, between 1956 and 1963, he helped lead the Giants to six division championships and the 1956 NFL Championship Game. He was selected as a first-team All-NFL player eight consecutive years and was also selected to play in the Pro Bowl nine times. After retiring as a player, Brown remained with the Giants as an assistant coach and later as a scout. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1974, was named to the NFL's 75th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1994 and was named to the NFL's 100th Anniversary All-Time Team in 2019. He was also included on the NFL's 1950s All-Decade Team and The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players. Early years Brown was born in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 1932. Brown recalled his youth as follows: > I was always a big boy. When I was 6, my mother put me in school and I took > a test. I must have passed it because they put me in third grade. No first > grade and no second grade. That meant I graduated from high school when I > was 15 and from college at 19. When I played my first game for the Giants, > in 1953, I was still 19. He attended Jefferson High School, the African American high school in Charlottesville. He played trombone in the school's band, having been forbidden to play football after his older brother was injured playing the sport and died. The school's football coach, Robert W. Smith, ultimately persuaded the 180-pound Brown recruited him to play football, though he did so initially without his father's knowledge. Coach Smith said, \\"The band director almost wanted to fight me for him. He said that 'Rosey' would be a great trumpet player, and I said he'd be a great blocker. I just couldn't see a 210 pound kid playing the trumpet.\\" Morgan State After graduating from high school, Brown attended Morgan State College, a historically black college in Baltimore, on a scholarship to play for the Morgan State Bears football team under head coach Edward P. Hurt. He was selected as an All-Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association player in both 1951 and 1952, and was a co-captain of the 1952 Morgan State team that compiled a 5-4 record. 2012 Morgan State Media Guide, p. 94. In December 1952, he was selected by the Pittsburgh Courier as a first-team offensive tackle on its 1952 All-America team. The Courier cited Brown's ability to open holes for Morgan State's backs and quoted Morgan State coach Hurt saying, \\"It is my considered opinion that Roosevelt Brown is the best tackle developed at Morgan State in recent years. He has weight, speed and aggressiveness. If some pro team doesn't pick him, it will be missing a bet.\\" Player for the New York Giants Signing and rookie season In January 1953, the New York Giants selected Brown in the 27th round (321st overall pick) of the 1953 NFL Draft. The Giants drafted Brown after seeing him featured in the Pittsburgh Courier's All-American team. Brown signed a one-year contract for $3,500 on March 25, 1953. Having been picked as the 321st player in the draft, he is considered \\"one of the biggest steals in draft history.\\" As a rookie, Brown appeared in all 12 games for a Giants team that compiled a 3‚Äì9 record during the 1953 season. In October 1953, sports writer Earl Wright wrote of Brown: \\"He is built like a museum statue ‚Äì slender hips and broad shoulders. But he is no statue on the field. He surprised the Giants by outrunning Arnie Weinmeister, New York's fleet defensive tackle, in windsprints.\\" Brown also gained attention as a rookie for his style, wearing \\"fancy street clothing\\" and regularly sporting a mustache, derby hat and umbrella. 1954 and 1955 seasons Brown again started all 12 games for the 1954 and 1955 Giants teams that compiled records of 7‚Äì5 and 6‚Äì5‚Äì1. The Giants teams during these years was overwhelmingly white, and Brown spent most of his time with Emlen Tunnell, the other African-American starter on the team. The two were roommates in New York. On the road, team owner Wellington Mara arranged for the two to stay in private homes with black families rather than staying in the hotels with the white players. Brown later recalled that segregation had its benefits: > [W]e loved it! Hell, we didn't have curfews like the others had. We could do > just about anything we wanted to do and didn't have any coaches to check on > us. We could drink beer in our rooms, have people in, party it up. We had > the best deal. It made me kind of angry when segregation ended and we had to > stay with the white boys. 1956 NFL championship In 1956, the Giants compiled an 8‚Äì3‚Äì1 record and won the 1956 NFL Championship Game. Brown played a key role for the Giants' championship team, blocking for the team's backs Frank Gifford (819 rushing yards), Alex Webster (694 rushing yards), and Mel Triplett (515 rushing yards). Sports writer Murray Olderman wrote: \\"The New York Giants have football's greatest ground threat, and Roosevelt Brown, an ultra-fast 245-pounder, is an integral part of it.\\" Gifford, the NFL's Most Valuable Player in 1956, later said: \\"I wouldn't be in the Hall of Fame if it weren't for him. ... The longest run of my career was on a pitchout against Washington. Rosie made a block at the line of scrimmage. I cut it up, and then I'm running downfield and I look up and I see No. 79 in front of me, and he wiped out another guy.\\" At the end of the 1956 season, Brown was unanimously selected as a first-team All-NFL player by the Associated Press (AP), United Press (UP), NEA, The Sporting News, and New York Daily News. Brown was one of only two players to be chosen by all 28 AP voters as a first-team All-NFL player. He was also received the NFL's Lineman of the Year award. 1957 to 1965 seasons Brown remained a fixture in the Giants' offensive line through the 1965 season. In his prime, between 1956 and 1963, he helped lead the team to six division championships and one NFL championship. Brown was known primarily as an offensive tackle but also played on the Giants' kickoff, kickoff return, punt, punt return, and field goal attempt platoons. He was also known on defense as the \\"head 'traffic cop' on New York's last-ditch 'goal-line stand' platoon.\\" Brown was also known for his physique. A 1964 article in The New York Times noted: > His neck, shoulders and chest are massive. But the body tapers in a heroic > way. His waist and buttocks, in proportion to what's above, are small. Then > come the legs, similarly massive. ... A lady of certain artistic talent has > tried numerous times to capture Rosey Brown on her sketch pad. She has never > been satisfied with the results. 'I'm not worthy of the subject,' she has > said. 'I leave him to Michelangelo.' In November 1964, at age 32, Brown acknowledged that time was catching up with him: \\"You lose a step and you're done. You know how to do things, but you can't do them any more.\\" Brown lasted one more year, appearing in all 14 games for the 1965 Giants. In all, Brown appeared in 162 games for the Giants, missing only four games during his 13-year NFL career. Brown was selected as a first-team All-NFL player eight times during his NFL career: 1956 (AP, UPI, NEA, Sporting News); 1957 (AP, UPI, NEA, Sporting News); 1958 (AP, UPI, NEA, Sporting News); 1959 (AP, UPI, NEA, Sporting News); 1960 (UPI, Sporting News); 1961 (AP, UPI, NEA, Sporting News); 1962 (AP, UPI); and 1963 (UPI, NEA). He was also selected to play in the Pro Bowl nine times: 1955, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1962, 1964, and 1965. While playing with the Giants, Brown and his wife Thelma were residents of Teaneck, New Jersey, where they were neighbors of New York Yankees catcher Elston Howard. Coaching and scouting career In March 1966, Brown was hospitalized with phlebitis, calling into doubt his ability to continue his playing career. Brown participated in the Giants' summer camp, but on August 23, 1966, he announced his retirement as a player. The Giants announced at the same time that the team had hired Brown as an assistant coach. He became the Giants' assistant offensive line coach and was promoted to offensive line coach in 1969. He later worked as a scout for the Giants. As a player, coach and scout, his career with the Giants spanned more than 50 years. Honors and halls of fame Brown received numerous honors for his contributions to the sport. His honors include the following: * In August 1969, he was named to the NFL's 1950s All-Decade Team. * In 1974, he was inducted into the Morgan State University Hall of Fame.2012 Media Guide, p. 95. * In January 1975, Brown was named to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. * In April 1979, he was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame. * In August 1994, he was named to the National Football League 75th Anniversary All-Time Team selected by a 15-person panel of NFL and Pro Football Hall of Fame officials, former players, and media representatives. * In August 1999, Brown was ranked number 57 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players. * In 2010, he was included in the inaugural class of the New York Giants Ring of Honor. Family and death In June 2004, Brown suffered a heart attack while gardening and died at his home in the Columbus section of Mansfield Township, Burlington County, New Jersey, at age 71. He was survived by his wife, the former Linda Lock, two stepchildren, and two sisters.

P. Hobson, or Peter Hobson, is a Professor of Developmental Psychopathology at University College London known for his work on autism and experimental child psychology. His research leads him to conclusions concerning the origins of consciousness, summarized in a book for the general reader, The Cradle of Thought. The core of his analysis is that human minds are the outcome of a successful series of interactions between infant and caregiver(s). In this Hobson's research has built on foundations established by Colwyn Trevarthen from the mid-1970s onwards. Trevarthen identified distinct steps in pre- lingual infant development, Primary Intersubjectivity and Secondary Intersubjectivity, which endow the infant's developing mind/brain with the architecture necessary for the achievement of symbolic thought. Hobson throws further light on this basic claim by examining what occurs in cases where, for genetic or environmental reasons, infants are denied the opportunity to investigate intersubjective relationships. To achieve a rare vantage point on human development without unethical experimentation, Hobson examines cases of autism, Down syndrome, congenital blindness and extreme social deprivation (for which statistically significant numbers of orphans rescued from Nicolae Ceau≈üescu's Romanian orphanages were available). The obstacles each of these circumstances placed in the way of normal infant-caregiver interaction are finely examined. Hobson's argument constitutes a challenge to certain flavors of sociobiology and Evolutionary Psychology, in that it traces the conception of the human mind back to a 'cradle' of social interactions, without which consciousness in the full, human sense is unobtainable. On the other hand, Hobson demonstrates that a hard-wired emotional connection is crucial for an infant to start the process of intersubjective learning. The experience of having an emotion elicited by another human being, and eliciting emotional responses in others, is identified as the material out of which humans fashion their sense of self, other, object and symbol. Hobson's thesis is of growing interest in Philosophy of Mind and related disciplines. Edward Skidelsky suggests that Hobson fatally overlooks the fact that people with autism learn to speak (see External Links, below). Others have understood Hobson to be blaming parents for autism, a charge explicitly rejected in The Cradle of Thought.

The Chilean Army occupied the present-day Tacna Department during the War of the Pacific from 1885 to 1929 when it was reincorporated into Peruvian soil; today, it is known for being one of the most patriotic areas in the country. Geography The department of Tacna is bordered by the Pacific Ocean on the west, the department of Moquegua on the north, the department of Puno on the northeast, the Bolivian La Paz Department on the east, and the Arica- Parinacota Region of Chile on the south. The border between the Tacna Region and Chile is known as La L√≠nea de la Concordia. The region is located below the Titicaca plateau and has a diverse geography, including volcanoes, deserts, and mountainous zones, from which arise rivers that go over the punas and the plateaus, thus forming the hydrographical system of this zone. The region is small in size but has a significant mining and agriculture potential. It has various climates and diverse production. Climate This area has a large amount of sunshine year round due to its stable descending air and high pressure. According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Tacna has a desert climate, abbreviated \\"Bwh\\" on climate maps.Climate Summary for Tacna, Peru History Inca Trail (Qhapaq √ëan) and terraces in Tarata (Pacific Rim). Monument to the Battle of Tacna in the Alto de la Alianza, Cerro Intiorko in Tacna. Miculla Petroglyphs, in the district of Pach√≠a. Fountain in Tacna. Prehistoric era There is evidence of the presence of a very early culture that goes back more than 10 000 years. The archaeological investigations in the region have proved that a civilization dwelled in this zone in the Stone Age. The Toquepala Caves (7630 BC) and Abrigo de Caru (6240 BC) belong to this age. There are other sites such as Girata Complex, Mullini, and Que√±avichinca, where investigations have not been concluded. Spanish conquest The first groups of Spanish conquerors arrived in the region in 1535. These groups were formed by members of the Almagro expedition, organized to conquer Chile. During this time, the city of Tacna was called Villa San Pedro de Tacna. In 1615 and 1784 Tacna experienced violent earthquakes, and many towns were reduced to ruins. However, they were rebuilt by their people who decided to stay in the same place. 19th century Tacna has a seat of honor in the emancipation process. Since 1810, the local patriots, following the example of their Argentine neighbors, who had already declared their independence, started to conspire. In 1811, Francisco Antonio De Zela sent forth the first libertarian outcry in Tacna. Once the Peruvian independence was consummated, the heroism of this city was honored by promoting it to the rank of villa in 1823. On May 26, 1828, President Jos√© de La Mar promulgated a law given by Congress by which the city of Tacna was given the title of Ciudad Heroica (Heroic City). During the War of the Pacific against Chile, the tacne√±os placed themselves in the front line, offering their lives defending the nation. Chilean administration On May 26, 1880, after the Battle of Alto de la Alianza, the Chilean army occupied the Tacna province. Under the terms of the treaty, Chile was to occupy the provinces of Tacna and Arica for ten years, after which a plebiscite was to be held to determine the region's sovereignty. Tacna remained under Chilean control for 50 years, during which Chilean groups and authorities lead a campaign of Chilenization in an attempt to persuade the local population to abandon their Peruvian past and accept Chilean nationality. However, Peruvian nationalists ensured that the Chilean propaganda failed and the planned plebiscite was never held. Finally, in 1929, the Treaty of Lima was signed in which Chile kept Arica, while Peru reacquired Tacna and receiving $6 million indemnity and other concessions. Some of the important persons that lived in Tacna during the Chilean administration was Salvador Allende and his family; they lived eight years in the city. Salvador lived in Tacna since he was a baby, he arrived in 1908 and studied in the Tacna School (Liceo de Tacna). =Maritime dispute= On January 26, 2007, Peru‚Äôs government issued a protest against Chile‚Äôs demarcation of the coastal frontier the two countries share. Peruvian President Alan Garc√≠a recalled his ambassador to Chile, Hugo Otero, to Lima to consult about the controversy over the maritime boundary the two countries share. According to the Peruvian Foreign Ministry, the Chilean legislatures endorsed a plan regarding the Arica and Parinacota region which does not comply with the current, established demarcation of the border. Moreover, they allege that the proposed Chilean law includes an assertion of sovereignty over 19,000 square meters of land in Peru's Department of Tacna. According to the Peruvian Foreign Ministry, Chile had defined a new region \\"without respecting the Concordia demarcation.\\" The Peruvian government maintained that the dispute over the Chilean plan is part of an ongoing maritime dispute whereby Chile has tried to use the demarcation process to extend its maritime frontier. Over the past 50 years, Peru has maintained claims over roughly 40,000 square kilometers of ocean territory. The Chilean government has asserted that the region in dispute is not a coastal site named Concordia, but instead refers to boundary stone No. 1, which is located to the northeast and 200 meters inland.Peru protests against Chile's new definition of territory Xinhua People‚Äôs Daily online. (accessed January 27, 2007) Given that the proposed Chilean law does not recognize the borderline established by both nations in the 1929 agreement, Peru lodged diplomatic protests with Chile. In the complex territorial dispute, Chile is asserting the border near the Pacific Ocean to fit in the geographical parallel, which Lima asserts will cut off at least 19,000 squares meters of the Peruvian territory.Prensa Latina A possible border dispute was averted when the Chilean Constitutional Court ruled on January 26, 2007, unconstitutional legislation. Peru said, \\"could be seen as a move by Chile to encroach on its maritime territorial sovereignty.\\" While agreeing with the court's ruling, the Chilean government reiterated its stance that the maritime borders between the two nations were not in question and have been formally by the international community.Chilean court ruling averts looming border dispute with Peru ‚Äì International Herald Tribune Peruvian Foreign Minister Jose Garcia has expressed that his country may turn to the international court at The Hague but has said that the necessary documents for that action are not ready.‚ÄúPeru-Chile Sea Dispute May Go to The Hague‚Äù Lima, Jan 27, 2007 Prensa Latina (accessed Jan 28 2007) On January 28, 2007, Peru‚Äôs leading newspaper El Comercio reported that the President of the Cabinet of Ministers (Consejo de Ministros del Per√∫), Jorge del Castillo, expressed his grave concern over the pending maritime dispute with Chile.El Comercio /Politica/Lunes, 29 de enero de 2007 The maritime boundary between Chile and Peru as defined by the International Court of Justice on 27 January 2014. On January 27, 2014, in the final ruling of the International Court of Justice located in The Hague, Peru gained some maritime territory. The maritime boundary extends only to off of the coast. From that point, the new border runs in a southwesterly direction to a point that is equidistant from the coast of the two countries. Under the ruling, Chile lost control over part of its formerly claimed maritime territory and gave additional maritime territory to Peru. From the 27 January 2014 court press release: Political division Map of the Tacna region showing its provinces The Tacna Region is divided into four provinces (, singular: provincia), which are composed of 26 districts (distritos, singular: distrito). Provinces The provinces, with their capitals in parenthesis, are: * Candarave (Candarave) * Jorge Basadre (Locumba) * Tacna (Tacna) * Tarata (Tarata) Economy Tacna's primary income earner is copper mining. Agriculturally, Tacna produces 53.15% of the whole olive crop in Peru. It also produces maize, potatoes, wheat, cotton, oregano, alfalfa, and grapevine (for the production of wine and pisco). It also has a sizable herd of dairy cattle and lamb. In addition to mining and agriculture, fishing is also important, as Tacna's sea is abundant in fish resources. Local customs Typical dishes and beverages Tacna offers visitors colorful dishes exquisitely combined and abundantly served. The picante a la Tacne√±a and patazca Tacne√±a belong to this region. Corn and cheese, chicharrones with toasted corn, cuy, or guinea pig chactado, corn cake with peanuts and raisins, baked pork, grilled lamb, are also local specialties. To drink, Tacna has macerated Brussels apricot, frutilla or tumbo, and wines produced in the local vineyards. Festivities Carnivals.

Due to the region's location near the Equator it has a warm climate, with beaches that are considered among the finest in Peru. Despite its small area, the region contains a wide variety of ecosystems. It is the smallest department in Peru and its third least populous department after Moquegua and Madre de Dios, but it is also its third most densely populated department, after La Libertad and Lambayeque. The name \\"Tumbes\\" originates from either Tumpis, a group of native peoples from the area, the word tumbos, a species of Passiflora that used to abound in the area, or the name of the Tumba cacique, whose son founded and populated the area. Geography The Tumbes Region is bordered by the Ecuadorian provinces of El Oro and Loja on the east; Peru's Piura Region on the south; and by the Pacific Ocean on the north and west. Morphologically, four zones can be defined in the region: the delta of the Tumbes and Zarumilla rivers; an alluvial plain north of the Tumbes River, with dry, low-depth ravines; ancient terraces that have been strongly eroded in the M√°ncora area; and the Amotape mountain range in the east and south, ending at El Barco Mountain. The delta of the Tumbes river is shallow, and when the tide is low, little sandy keys show up, which get covered by mangrove vegetation. Despite its small area‚Äî it is the second-smallest region in Peru‚Äî Tumbes has a great variety of ecosystems: mangroves, Tumbes-Piura dry forests, the only coastal tropical forests in Peru, and a rich and warm sea. Around 50% of the region's territory is covered by three protected natural areas: the Manglares de Tumbes National Sanctuary (which is part of the Gulf of Guayaquil-Tumbes mangroves), the Cerros de Amotape National Park and the Tumbes Reserved Zone. Demographics Basically composed of a large mestizo population rooted in a mixture between the pre-Incan Tumpis and Tallanes tribes, Spanish, creoles, the African peoples, including mulatos or zambos, and a small Chinese community of mostly Cantonese ancestry. Population According to the 1993 Census, the Tumbes Region has a population of 155,521 inhabitants, 53% of which (82,426) are male and 47% (73,095) are female. , the Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica e Inform√°tica estimates the region's population to be 215,634. Languages The majority of the region's residents (98.3%) speak Spanish as their native tongue; other languages spoken are Quechua (0.4%), foreign languages (0.1%), Aymara (60 speakers, 0.0%), and other indigenous languages (0.1%). Immigration Immigrants from other regions make up 29.4% of the population; 0.2% of residents were born in a foreign country. The largest immigrant groups are from the regions of Piura (16.9% of the total population), Lambayeque (3.7%), and the Lima Province/Lima Region (2.8%). Age The population is spread out, with 49.4% under the age of 20, 10.7% from 20 to 24, 26.6% from 25 to 44, 9.7% from 45 to 64, and 3.5% who are 65 years of age or older. Education The literacy rate in the region is 90.4%. Secondary education has been completed by 31.8% of the population and 4.5% also have graduated from non-university higher education, while 2.3% have complete university studies. 45.9% only have attended primary education and 5.9% have not had any education. Political division Political map of the Tumbes region The region is divided into three provinces (, singular: provincia), which are composed of twelve districts (distritos, singular: distrito). The provinces, with their capitals in parenthesis, are: * Contralmirante Villar (Zorritos) * Tumbes (Tumbes) * Zarumilla (Zarumilla) History Tumbes cathedral. Tumbes was a populated region well before the Inca Empire. The first settlers were fishers and hunters. Most recent cultures that lived there have left evidence of the refinement in their ceramics, and huacas or ruins that still stand today. Tumbes was integrated into the Inca Empire during the reign of Sapa Inca Pachacuti. He introduced a new way of organizing the empire, but the task of integration continued during Tupac Inca Yupanqui's and Huayna Capac's reigns. He made it a key departure point for his campaign to conquer the Ca√±aris. The adventure of the Spanish Conquistadores had its beginning in Tumbes: at Puerto Pizarro Francisco Pizarro and his men landed in search of gold. The conquerors set off to the rest of the empire, founding cities and overpowering their people.Prescott, W.H., 2011, The History of the Conquest of Peru, Digireads.com Publishing, During colonial times, Tumbes was no more than a crossing point where soldiers and adventurers stopped momentarily to restock themselves, and continue traveling. Tumbes, however, gained permanent importance after Peru's independence; with Ecuador's long-standing territorial claims over the Loreto Region of Peru, Tumbes's closeness to the border exposed it as a resistance point in some episodes of the Ecuadorian‚ÄìPeruvian War. As part of the decentralization process in Peru, a referendum was held on October 30, 2005 to decide whether the region would merge with the regions of Piura and Lambayeque to create the new Northern Region (). However, voters in the region voted against the merge. Attractions Touristic sites The fact that Tumbes lies so close to the Equator has determined its landscape, which teems in plant life. The beaches of Tumbes and its warm sea are ideal for surfing and scuba diving. Its pure white sands, sun and warm weather all year long, and a sea ideal for water sports, make the beach of Punta Sal one of the finest on the Peruvian coast. North of the city of Tumbes lies Puerto Pizarro, the gateway to the National Mangroves Sanctuary. The mangroves have formed vast clumps of saltwater-tolerant coastal forests which have created a unique ecosystem linking the river and the sea. The mangroves are the breeding grounds for black scallops, which are served up in Tumbes' most famous dish, the black scallop ceviche. South of Tumbes lies Zorritos, the town which received its name from workers involved in drilling the first oilwell in the area, back in 1863. Not far from Zorritos lies the Bocap√°n beach, where visitors can swim in Hervideros, natural hot springs bubbling with iodized salts. Typical dishes and beverages The typical dishes of the Tumbesino cuisine are based on seafood‚Äî ceviche of black scallops, crab, or shrimps, or cebiche mixto‚Äî and Tumbiresas covered by yucca and banana balls broth with dominicos, meat, red peppers, eggs, olives, raisins, flour, coriander and other herbs. Other specialties include the shrimp omelette, chupe de cangrejos, and crabmeat omelette. A typical beverage in the region is the chinguirito, which is obtained by combining pipa (the milk of a soft coconut) with the famous grape brandy called pisco.

He later taught theology at the same university. His precocity was extraordinary; at three years of age he was able to read, and in his thirteenth year he composed Greek and Latin orations and delivered them in public. When he was about eighteen he went to the University of Copenhagen and afterwards studied at Rostock and Wittenberg. He then travelled through Germany, the Netherlands, England, France and Italy, and was received with marked respect at the different universities he visited. In 1613 he was chosen professor of medicine in the University of Copenhagen, and filled that office for eleven years, when, falling into a dangerous illness, he made a vow that if he should recover he would apply himself solely to the study of divinity. He fulfilled his vow by becoming professor of divinity at Copenhagen and canon of Roskilde. He died on 13 July 1629 at Sor√∏ in Zealand. His work, Anatomicae Institutiones Corporis Humani (1611) was for many years a standard textbook on the subject of anatomy. He was the first to describe the workings of the olfactory nerve. Of his sons, two, Thomas and Erasmus, were also noted scholars.

Biography Ptolemy was probably still alive c. 180. No other certain details are known about his life; Harnack's suggestion that he was identical with the Ptolemy spoken of by Justin Martyr is as yet unproved.Text. u. Untersuch. New. Ser. XIII, Anal. z. √§lt. Gesch. d. Chr. It is not known when Ptolemy became a disciple of Valentinius, but Valentinius was active in the Egyptian city of Alexandria and in Rome. Ptolemy was, with Heracleon, the principal writer of the Italian or Western school of Valentinian Gnosticism, which was active in Rome, Italy, and Southern Gaul. Works Epistle to Flora Ptolemy's works have reached us in an incomplete form in a fragment of an exegetical writing preserved by Iren√¶us;Adversus haereses I, viii, 5. as well as an epistle to Flora, a Christian lady not otherwise known to us. The epistle was found in the works of Epiphanius.H√¶r. XXXIII, 3-7 It was written in response to Flora's inquiry concerning the origin of the Ten Commandments contained of the Old Testament. Those laws, Ptolemy states, cannot be attributed to the Supreme God, nor to the devil; indeed, the set of laws does not even proceed from a single law- giver. A part of it is the work of an inferior god, analogous to the gnostic demiurge; the second part is attributable to Moses, and the third part to the elders of the Jewish people. This demiurge occupies a middle position between the Supreme God and the devil, and is the creator of the material universe; he is neither perfect nor the author of evil, but ought to be called 'just' and benevolent to the extent of his abilities. In his cosmogonic depiction of the universe, Ptolemy referred also to an extensive system of aeons that emanated from a monadic spiritual source. Thirty of these, he believed, ruled the higher world, the pleroma. This system became the basis of an exegesis which expounds the first Ogdoad of the Pleroma based on the prologue of John's gospel. In addition, Ptolemy subdivides the part of the Decalogue ascribed to the inferior god into three further sections: * The absolutely pure legislation of the Decalogue which was not destroyed but fulfilled by the Saviour. * The laws mixed with evil, including the right of retaliation, which were abolished by the Saviour because they were incompatible with His nature. * The section which is typical and symbolical of the higher world. This part of the Decalogue includes such precepts as circumcision and fasting and was raised by the saviour from a sensible to a spiritual plane. References * Elaine Pagels.

It was announced on 28 October 2003 and released in February 2004. The 6230 is business-styled but it does feature a VGA resolution digital camera, video camera, a music player and expandable memory.http://www.s21.com/nokia-6230.htm It is considered to be one of the loudest Nokia phones. Cingular Wireless was the primary GSM carrier that offered the Nokia 6230b in the United States. Other companies such as Cincinnati Bell, Simmetry Communications, Viaero Wireless and Telcel also offered this model. Features It features a 16-bit TFT color screen with a resolution of 128√ó128 pixels, a VGA camera that can record video clips in H.263 (SubQCIF) format at 128√ó96 pixels at 15 FPS, built-in Bluetooth wireless technology, FM radio (when a wired headset is attached to the Pop-Port interface to act as an antenna), and playback of 3GP video/audio at up to 30 FPS and MP3, AAC and AMR audio. It is also EGPRS (EDGE) capable of speeds up to 220 kbit/s. In addition, it has changeable Xpress-on covers available for purchase. It uses an Extended Li-Ion Battery of 850 mAh. The 6230 accepts MMC memory cards up to 4 GB in capacity formatted in FAT32 or FAT16 file systems (supported by later firmware releases) on which multimedia files and data can be stored. SD cards are not supported. It operates on either GSM 900/1800/1900 MHz (Nokia 6230 RH-12), or GSM 850/1800/1900 MHz (Nokia 6230b RH-28) for the North American market. It was the first non-smartphone with an expandable memory card slot and was usually supplied with a 32MB MMC Card. A black Nokia 6230 Nokia 6230i Nokia 6230i In early 2005 Nokia released an updated 6230i model (RM-72) which includes a 1.3-megapixel camera instead of a 0.3, 208√ó208 screen resolution (65,536 colours), a slightly larger display, a raised selection button in the midst of the scroll key, and a modern redesigned menu. It is also standard UMS (USB mass storage device class) compliant, i.e. no proprietary drivers are required to transfer data to and from the device's memory card. It weighs 99 g (including battery BL-5C) and the dimensions are 103 mm x 44 mm x 20 mm, 76 cc. The BL-5C battery that comes standard with it will last about 150‚Äì300 hours, depending on usage. This model was available only in GSM 900/1800/1900 MHz; Nokia did not release an 850 MHz version for the North American market. The next model in the 623x series is the 3G GSM/WCDMA Nokia 6233. Appearance The graphical user interface was overhauled, and many of the icons featured on the 6230i are the same as those now used uniformly across almost all new Nokia phones. Notably, the menu icons on the Nokia 6230i are animated, as opposed to the previous model which were static. The phone has seven built-in themes ('Basic', 'Circle', 'DotSpace', 'Dots2', 'Microdots', 'Waves', and 'Window'), and users can download more. In addition, users may customise the color of the borders, and the battery and signal bars. The operating system does run more slowly than on the 6230, possibly due to the increased processor drain of the higher resolution screen. Nokia also removed several options from menus, such as: brightness control, and the ability to automatically overwrite text messages in the Inbox/Sent Folders. These changes have brought widespread complaints. Security The phone can automatically lock after a set time, starting from five seconds of no activity. In addition to the auto-lock, users can lock with a 'keyguard', which prevents unauthorised use of the phone. The code it uses is the standard security code. If the user gets this code wrong three time, the phone is 'locked out', whereby no-one can gain access for ten minutes. Users can choose to protect their phone by enabling a PIN. When enabled, the phone will prompt users to type the PIN, and on success the phone will grant access. Users can also protect their SIM card, which is standard phone practice. Organization The Nokia 6230i has organizing software, such as: calendar, alarm clock, to-do list, notes, wallet. The 'Wallet' is a password protected area where users can store bank card details, tickets, receipts, and personal notes. Users can set different profiles within the 'Wallet', for example 'work' or 'personal', whereby different card details, for example, can be stored. There is an e-mail application, but it must be set up by the user's mobile phone network. Phone book Further to storing mobile numbers, users can add e-mail addresses, home-phone numbers, an image (shows when contact calls), PTT addresses, postal addresses, web addresses, notes, and user identification. Contacts can be put into groups, for example 'work colleagues' but such groups do not appear to be usable for text messaging. There is a Distribution List feature under Messages where users can send group SMS (Only available with the 6210). Users can add sixteen voice commands (also known as 'Voice tags'), whereby users can say a contact's name and the phone will automatically call that contact (only if the user individually sets a voice per person). Connectivity The Nokia 6230i is GPRS enabled. It features a GPRS Class 10 connectivity at up to 48 kbit/s. It is also EDGE enabled at Class 10 offering speeds up to 236.8 kbit/s. It also has an infrared port and is Bluetooth enabled, making it one of the few phones to feature both infrared and Bluetooth. Media A silver Nokia 6230 The Nokia 6230i features an integrated music player which can play MP3 and AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) format files. The music player has an inbuilt Graphic Equalizer and the ability to create and save custom equalizers. Up to seven different equalizer settings are available. The phone plays exceptionally high quality audio. The Music Players also includes the ability to play music via Bluetooth. It included the song \\"Strange Transmissions\\" by Norah Jones & The Peter Malick Group. It also includes a Media Player to play video files in 3GP formats. The video recording is done in 3GP format as well. The phone also includes a Radio (headset is required to be connected) in which 20 radio channels can be saved. Auto tuning of frequencies can be done automatically. The Nokia 6230i also features a Voice Recorder with up to 60 minutes of voice recording. Push to talk (PTT) The Nokia 6230i features Push to talk (PTT). Push to talk (PTT) functions as a two-way radio. The PTT option is available only if enabled by the service provider. Extra applications The phone also has a basic calculator, countdown timer, and a stopwatch, which has two settings: 'Split timing' and 'Lap timing', both allow users to save and name their times. It also includes integrated \\"Message counter\\" which counts the number of messages sent and received. Another application called \\"GPRS data counter\\" shows the data received and sent during each session and also for all sessions combined. \\"GPRS connection timer\\" registers the time for each session. The phone also supports speed dials, up to nine numbers can be assigned for speed dialing. Collection folder Users can download new applications (through WAP) which are stored in a folder named 'Collections'. However, Nokia included three applications. 'World clock II' allows users to view time zones across the world; the graphical user interface highlights the current time zone yellow, and allows users to navigate, left or right, across the world, showing the city at the centre of the time zone. 'Converter II' is an excellent application for converting anything from currencies, grams, pounds, and so forth. Through the 'Options', users can customise the conversions to suit their needs; this is especially useful when currencies alter in value. The final application is a translation tool ('Translator'). For example, if a search query is 'help', then the application will show five translations (English, French, German, Spanish, and Italian). The problem is that the phone is limited to 2 MB of applications regardless the size of the Multimedia Card or the internal memory. Bugs A few bugs have been reported with this phone: *When using a Bluetooth audio device together with voice tags, the ringing tone is always ascending, even when ascending is not selected. The only temporary solution is to reset the phone, although the problem comes back when using Bluetooth and voice tags again. This bug is still present in the latest firmware. *Sometimes, the display lights up for a few seconds and then goes out again. This happens when the phone battery depletes by one \\"bar\\", which may be seen as pointless as the lights coming on would increase drain on the battery. This was meant to be an early warning for low battery. *Sometimes, for no apparent reason, an image or video clip is copied. *In the music player, when selecting an entry in the playlist at a position higher than 255 the player has a wrap around bug and will play the entry 255 positions before the one selected. For example, if entry 260 is selected entry 5 will be played, if entry 300 is selected entry 45 will be played. This is caused by the music player using an unsigned 8-bit integer to store the selected track. This bug is present on the 6230, 6230i and early versions of the 6233. The work around is use the playlist to see the entry number, then go back to the currently playing entry and type in the number of the entry you want (jump to). *On newer firmware version of the 6230i, the camera is unable to process images that are bigger than 786 KB. This can be experienced when taking pictures at top quality setting in 1280x1024 mode of scenes with lots of fine details, like the leaves on a tree. You will sometimes get a message like \\"Unable to save\\" because the image processor in the camera module does not have enough memory to create the compressed JPEG file from the image sensor data. *While the 6230i is able to use a 4 GB MMC card (provided it is formatted with FAT16) it will fail to enter mass storage mode when a 4 GB MMC is present. *On older versions of the BL-5C battery, the internal chemicals would leak/react while charging for long periods of time. While this is rare, Nokia offered a free replacement. *When the phone is left on for extended periods, the ringer volume is set to low, regardless of the setting.

Nature and national parks The Jaguar inhabits all of Alto Paraguay's national parksAlto Paraguay contains a varied and large amount of natural resources, which is why this department is home to several national parks, each with different characteristics. The Defensores del Chaco National Park is the largest in the Paraguayan territory. The mentioned park is home to the hill Cerro Le√≥n, which is the highest point in the northern region of Paraguay. The dry surface is optimal for the growth of different kinds of cactus. Another park in this department, Parque Nacional R√≠o Negro, is located in an area with several small lakes and is home to most of the fauna in the department. Other national parks in Alto Paraguay are Parque Nacional Coronel Cabrera and Parque Nacional Chovoreca, which reside in dry regions. Agriculture, livestock and deforestation Sorghum harvest 2008, Linea 14, Agua Dulce Region Sugar cane, Linea 14, Agua Dulce Region Paraguay's largest reserves of undeveloped fertile virgin forest covered land and lowest land prices are found in Alto Paraguay; thus, agriculture and cattle farming are starting to make inroads. The fertility of the Chaco's deep sedimentary soils is generally high, except in the westernmost parts, where there are very sandy soils, and some seasonal wetlands in the eastern plain. Annual rainfall is sufficient in the east (around 1200mm), fair in the center (around 900mm) and scarce in the west (around 700mm). The most challenging aspect for farmers is the lack of decent roads and infrastructure. The advance of agriculture is inevitably at the expense of the area's native forest. During the two decades 1990 to 2010 Paraguay had one of the highest deforestation rates worldwide. The World Land Trust estimates deforestation in the Paraguay Chaco at over 200.000 hectare for 2008 alone The department's most important activity by far is cattle ranching, both extensive in the savannas of the east and intensive on the planted pastures of cleared land. Cultivation of sorghum, sugar cane and (in planning stage as of January 2009, for the arid west) jatropha are very recent developments.

Founded as an almshouse, the ancient sense of the word \\"hospital\\", it is a site located on Royal Hospital Road in Chelsea. It is an independent charity and relies partly upon donations to cover day-to-day running costs to provide care and accommodation for veterans. Residents are known as Chelsea Pensioners. Any man or woman who is over the age of 65 and served as a regular soldier may apply to become a resident, if they have found themselves in a time of need and are \\"of good character\\". They must not, however, have any dependent spouse or family, and former Officers must have served at least 12 years in the ranks before receiving a commission. The gardens of the Royal Hospital are Grade II listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. History The Royal Hospital on Stanford's map of central London 1897 King Charles II founded the Royal Hospital in 1682 as a retreat for veterans.Guidebook, p. 3 The provision of a hostel rather than the payment of pensions was inspired by Les Invalides in Paris. The site for the Royal Hospital was an area of Chelsea which held an incomplete building \\"Chelsey College\\", a theological college James I founded in 1609. Sir Stephen Fox (1627‚Äì1716), the inspiration behind the founding of the Hospital, and a generous benefactor. Portrait by John James Baker, collection of the Royal Hospital Chelsea The precursor to the foundation was the establishment in 1677 of pensions for \\"Reformed Officers (i.e. officers of disbanded regiments) and maimed soldiers\\". The main inspirational force behind the foundation of the Hospital was Sir Stephen Fox (1627‚Äì1716), Paymaster of the Forces and a trusted and able royal administrator of the King, and in 1681 Fox and the king initiated plans for a permanent hospital for disabled soldiers. Letters patent were issued on 22 December 1681 notifying the king's intention of building \\"an hospital for the relief of such land soldiers as are, or shall be, old, lame, or infirm in ye service of the crowne\\". For this purpose he appointed as \\"Receiver General and Treasurer of the moneys raised for the erection and maintenance of the hospital\\" Nicholas Johnson (d.1682), Fox's brother-in-law and successor as Paymaster of the Forces. The office of \\"Receiver or Paymaster and Treasurer\\" was held by all subsequent Paymaster of the Forces until the latter office was abolished in 1836.The Records of the War Office and Related Departments, 1660‚Äì1964 By Michael Roper, p.71 Fox himself, the \\"richest commoner in the three kingdoms\\", donated ¬£13,000 towards the new Hospital.Debrett's Genealogical Peerage of Great Britain and Ireland, 1847, p.422 The Royal Hospital opened its doors to the Chelsea Pensioners in 1692 for \\"the relief and succour\\" of veterans. Some of the first soldiers admitted included those injured at the Battle of Sedgemoor. Wren expanded his original design to add two additional quadrangles to the east and west of the central court; these were known respectively as the \\"Light Horse Court\\" and the \\"College Court\\".Guidebook, p. 4. Due to mismanagement by Lord Ranelagh, the Hospital Treasurer, the building was not completed until 1692. Sergeant William Hiseland, [1620‚Äì1732] an English Civil War cavalier and one of the first pensioners to be admitted to the Royal Hospital in London The Great Hall An anti-aircraft searchlight and crew 17 April 1940 Sir John Soane, who was clerk of works in the early part of the 19th century, designed and constructed a new infirmary building which was located to the west of the main building on the site of the current National Army Museum and was destroyed by bombing during the Second World War. It was replaced by a modern infirmary which was located to the east of the main building and opened by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 1961. The 1960s infirmary was demolished to make way for the Margaret Thatcher Infirmary which was designed by Sir Quinlan Terry and was completed in 2008, providing a state-of-the-art care home. The Chapel, Royal Hospital Chelsea (1681‚Äì91), by Christopher Wren In 2002, the Sovereign's Mace was presented to the hospital ‚Äì up until then, the hospital had had no colours or distinctive device ‚Äì the Mace is now carried at all the ceremonial events at the Hospital.Guidebook, p. 6. The Mace was designed by Charles Webb and Aubrey Bowden and was made by Master Goldsmith Norman Bassant. The bowl of the Mace is decorated with acorns and is surmounted by the St Edward's Crown. In March 2009, the first women in the Hospital's 317-year history were admitted as In-Pensioners. Winifred Phillips and Dorothy Hughes were the first. Phillips trained as a nurse and later joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service in 1948 before enlisting in the Women's Royal Army Corps in 1949 while serving in Egypt. After 22 years service she retired with the rank of Warrant Officer Class 2. Hughes had joined the British Army in 1941 aged 18, later working as part of 450 Heavy Anti Aircraft Battery in the London Division. In 1945 the Battery was deployed near Dover to defend against V1 flying bomb attacks. She retired with the rank of Sergeant. Clothing Chelsea Pensioners are entitled to come and go from the Royal Hospital as they please, and are permitted to wear civilian clothing wherever they travel. However, within the hospital, and in the surrounding area, pensioners are encouraged to wear a blue uniform (known fondly as \\"blues\\"). If they travel farther from the Royal Hospital they should wear the distinctive scarlet coats instead of the blue uniform. The scarlet coats are also worn for ceremonial occasions, accompanied by tricorne hats. (At other times a peaked shako is worn.) In uniform, the pensioners wear their medal ribbons and the insignia of rank they reached while serving in the military. They may also wear other insignia they earned during their service and many pensioners now wear parachute jump wings and even SAS jump wings. Contrary to popular belief, it is not illegal to impersonate a Chelsea pensioner; the myth probably dates from a ruling, repealed by the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 2008, regarding the fraud of taking an unearned pension. Founder's Day The Royal Hospital Founder's Day takes place close to 29 May each year ‚Äì the birthday of Charles II, and the date of his restoration as King in 1660. It is also known as Oak Apple Day, as it commemorates the escape of the future King following his defeat at the Battle of Worcester in 1651, when he hid in the Royal Oak to avoid capture by Parliamentary forces. On Founder's Day, in-pensioners of the Royal Hospital are reviewed by a member of the British Royal Family. Statue of King Charles II King Charles II in the Figure Court of the Royal Hospital Chelsea. The 7' 6\\" (229 cm) statue of King Charles II which stands in the central court (the Figure Court) of the Hospital was cast in copper alloy by Grinling Gibbons; it was originally gilded but was bronzed in 1787.Guidebook, p. 9 In 2002, the statue was regilded to celebrate Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee. Chapel The Hospital's chapel was designed by Sir Christopher Wren and is a fine and rare example of Wren's pure ecclesiastical work: it rises high and was completed in 1687. The chapel contains a fine painting of the Resurrection in the half dome of the apse, painted by Sebastiano Ricci and his nephew Marco (who assisted with the painting at the Royal Hospital) and dates from the end of Queen Anne's reign. The Chapel was consecrated in August 1691, and services were formerly held twice daily. Nowadays services are confined to Sunday mornings and special military occasions. Great Hall The Great Hall was also designed by Sir Christopher Wren and was originally intended as a dining hall, furnished with 16 long tables, one for each original Long Ward. It contains a large mural painting from around 1690, which depicts King Charles the second on horseback being crowned by the winged figure of Victory, with the Royal Hospital Buildings behind. Just before 1800 the pensioners started dining in the wards and the hall was then used for recreational purposes. It was here that the Duke of Wellington lay in state in 1852 and the table on which his coffin rested is just inside the entrance. The hall reverted to its original use as a dining hall in 1955.Guidebook, p. 10 State Apartments The heavily moulded ceiling displaying James II‚Äôs cypher is by John Grove, the wainscoting is by William Cleere and the fine lime-wood carving over the fireplace is by William Emmett. The room was completed between 1685 and 1688. It was fully roofed in 1685 days before Charles II died. Within the State Apartments is also an Ante-Chamber. Both the Council Chamber and Ante-Chamber can be hired for private functions and weddings. Margaret Thatcher Infirmary Margaret and Denis Thatcher, whose ashes were interred at the infirmary in 2013 and 2003 respectively The Margaret Thatcher Infirmary (MTI) houses around 100 Chelsea Pensioners. Opened in 2009 by the Prince of Wales it is a state-of-the-art care home that offers nursing and a GP surgery. The Matron is in charge of the infirmary and has a team including nurses, therapists and care staff. The MTI has a gym and a hydrotherapy pool for use by In-Pensioners. It has a range of activities pensioners can join, from pottery classes to poetry recitals. The infirmary received the Quality Hallmark Award at Beacon Status (the highest level possible) from the National Gold Standards Framework Centre in End of Life Care in 2015. Ceremonies The annual Ceremony of the Christmas Cheeses is based on a 300-year-old tradition which began in 1692, when the Royal Hospital Chelsea asked a local cheesemonger to provide in-pensioners with cheese to get them through the festive period. The Dairy Council is now in its 56th year of organising a special ceremony at the Hospital, where donations from cheesemongers from across the country are presented to the residents. A Chelsea Pensioner cuts the ceremonial cheese with a sword and the cheese is distributed among the pensioners around the Christmas period. Another annual tradition at the Royal Hospital is the Christmas Cake Ceremony, which commenced in 1949. It is a symbol of the enduring friendship between the UK and Australia and takes the form of a Christmas cake being presented to the Hospital from the Australian Returned and Services League, with each Australian state taking it in turns year by year. Again, a pensioner at the Royal Hospital cuts the cake with a sword. Public opening and events The on-site museum details the history and life of the Royal Hospital and its In- Pensioners, together with displays of artefacts, documents, medals, cap badges and uniforms. Recent additions include the Sovereign's Mace and Parade Chair. A large diorama depicts the Royal Hospital and Ranelagh Gardens as they appeared in 1742. Daily walking tours of the site and museum, led by Chelsea pensioners themselves, can be booked in advance. The South Grounds of the Royal Hospital are also used for large-scale public events including the world-famous Chelsea Flower Show, held by the Royal Horticultural Society. The show has been held in the grounds since 1913, and attracts around 165,000 visitors. Singora Cannon The Singora cannon next to the flagpole in the grounds of the Figure Court Prominently displayed in the grounds next to the flagpole is an inscribed cannon from Singora bearing the seal of Sultan Sulaiman Shah. The cannon was made in Singora around 1623, captured from the Sultanate of Singora by the Siamese in 1680, taken from the Siamese by the Burmese in the Burmese‚ÄìSiamese war of 1765‚Äì1767 and transported to Burma. In the third Anglo-Burmese War (1885‚Äì1887) the cannon was taken by the British and shipped back to England.Scrivener, R.S. (1981), \\"The Siamese Brass Cannon in the Figure Court of the Royal Hospital, Chelsea, London\\", Journal of the Siam Society 69: 169‚Äì170, ISSN 0857-7099. Organisation The hospital maintains a 'military-based culture which puts a premium on comradeship'. The in-pensioners are formed into three companies, each headed by a Captain of Invalids (an ex-Army officer responsible for the 'day to day welfare, management and administration' of the pensioners under his charge). There is also a Secretary who traditionally was responsible for paying the Army pensions, but today they look after the annual budget, staff, buildings and grounds. Further senior staff include the Physician & Surgeon, the Matron, the Quartermaster, the Chaplain and the Adjutant.Annual Report, 2011 A Board of Commissioners has governed the Royal Hospital since 1702. The ex-officio chairman of the board is HM Paymaster General (whose predecessor Sir Stephen Fox was instrumental in founding the Hospital in the seventeenth century). The purpose of the Board is 'to guide the development of The Royal Hospital, ensuring the care and well-being of the Chelsea Pensioners who live there and safeguarding the historic buildings and grounds, which it owns in trust'.Corporate Information Royal Hospital Chelsea.

Damian is mostly known in the progressive metal genre, as the lead singer of Headspace and (formerly) Threshold. He also sang and toured with bands and projects such as for Star One, Ayreon, Landmarq, Praying Mantis and with Rick Wakeman's English Rock Ensemble. As a solo artist he has released 5 solo albums, a DVD and a retrospective compilation album. 1990 ‚Äì 2000 Damian began recording music in 1991 with the band Landmarq. He featured on their debut album, Solitary Witness which was released in 1992, followed by a second album, Infinity Parade (1993) and The Vision Pit (1995). Damian sang on English prog metal band Threshold's debut album Wounded Land' (1993). In 1996, Damian would join up with Threshold again to record their third album Extinct Instinct'. Another successful European tour followed, after which Damian left the group. During that time Iron Maiden approached Damian to audition and considered him as a replacement for the departing Bruce Dickinson. In 1997, Wilson's first solo album Cosmas was released. This album was a departure from the heavy/progressive rock sound that his fans had been used to. In 1998, Wilson was one of the lead vocalists on Arjen Lucassen's Ayreon album Into the Electric Castle. From 1998 to 2000 he played the lead role of Jean Valjean in Cameron Mackintosh's touring production of Les Mis√©rables. He was asked to audition for the role after he tripped over the dog owned by an actor who knew his work, while running along the Thames. 2000 ‚Äì 2010 After the Les Mis√©rables tour Damian sang on the next three Ayreon albums The Dream Sequencer, Flight of the Migrator and Ayreonauts Only. His collaboration with Arjen Lucassen would result in three more Star One albums; Space Metal (2002), Live on Earth (2003) and Victims of the Modern Age (2010). In 2000 and 2001, Damian toured Europe and South America with Rick Wakeman as part of the English Rock Ensemble. This resulted in a Live DVD and an album Out There. After the tour with Rick Wakeman, Damian released his second solo album Disciple (2001) which was partially recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London. The recording session at Abbey Road was filmed and broadcast by the BBC. Damian toured his solo material with a full band under the name Damian Wilson Band. A second tour was planned, but Damian was hospitalized and the tour was cancelled. A studio session recording of the rehearsals for the tour was released on CD in 2002, Live in Rehearsal. In 2003 Damian's third official album Let‚Äôs Start A Commune was released. Together with Adam Wakeman Damian formed the progressive rock band Headspace. Mainly to keep in contact with each other between their busy touring schedules. An EP I Am was released in 2007 and they supported Ozzy Osbourne on his Black Rain tour in 2007. Just before the start of their Dead Reckoning tour, Threshold singer Andrew McDermott leaves the band. Having only a few days to learn the new Threshold material, Damian stepped in as lead vocalist for the tour. Reinstated as lead vocalist, for the first time since 1997, Damian continued to tour with the band. In 2009 Damian tours Europe with his Damian Wilson Band. This time he performs songs from the bands and projects he has been involved in as well as solo material. The tour is filmed and released in 2011 as 3DVD set including a live concert and tour documentary Cheers Lads; 20 Years Of Avoiding A Job. 2010 ‚Äì present Within Temptation guitarist Ruud Jolie, who also played guitar during the 2009 DWB tour, asks Damian to sing for his side project Maiden uniteD‚Äô; a collective of musicians that play rearranged acoustic version of Iron Maiden tracks. Damian and Anneke van Giersbergen sing on their first album Mind The Acoustic Pieces (2010). After a small club tour the project takes off and Damian finds himself playing venues and big festivals all over Europe. He records two more albums with the project Across The Seventh Sea (2012) and Remembrance (2015). In the same year as the Damian Wilson Band live DVD set is released, Damian also releases a 31-track retrospective double album, I Thought The World Was Listening 1997 ‚Äì 2011. This album featured remastered tracks from throughout Damian's solo career, re-recorded versions of songs and previously unreleased new material. The release of this album also marked the return to the stage as a solo artist. Damian has been playing select solo shows, mainly acoustic, through Europe since 2011. Damian's solo album Cosmas is re-released as a remastered edition in 2012. On the last of a series of solo shows he played the album in its entirety. Headspace signed a three-record deal with Inside Out Music and their debut album I Am Anonymous is released in 2012. It is a concept album in which Damian's lyrics are directed the listener. \\"This is about you and your relationship with humanity, ultimately the battles fought within the mind from child to man. Through Kubler Ross' model of impending death, with reference to war, the turmoil leads us to peace and acceptance... only then to swing straight back round to chaos\\". A second album was released in 2016; All That You Fear Is Gone. 2012 is also the year in which Threshold releases its first album since 1996 with Damian as lead vocalist, March Of Progress, followed by an extensive European club and festival tour. A second album, For The Journey, follows in 2014. The following tour is recorded and released as double live album European Journey in 2015. Threshold and Damian parted ways in 2017. In October 2015 Damian announced two new albums for 2016. Weir Keeper's Tale; an acoustic album with Adam Wakeman, which was released in January 2016, and a new solo album, his first in over a decade. \\"I‚Äôve never stopped writing songs so I have accumulated a lot since my last solo album. In June we have started recording in Dublin with some amazing musicians from all over Europe. We‚Äôre happy to say that we‚Äôve come a long way these last couple of months and the album is taking shape. I believe we‚Äôre creating something worthy of your expectations. The songs reflect on how our personal relationships are relevant to the bigger picture, even on a world level\\". The new album Built for Fighting was released 9 September 2016. The album contains 11 new original songs and a cover of Depeche Mode's Somebody Built for Fighting was mixed and mastered in Sweden by the Fascination Street duo Jens Bogren and Tony Lindgren, who have worked with acts such as Opeth, Devin Townsend and Headspace. The track \\"Thrill Me\\" was released as a single on 9 August and made the BBC Radio 2 playlist. On 4 August 2017, a new version of the song \\"Impossible\\" was released. The track was remixed by Dave Bascombe. The second album with Adam Wakeman, accompanied with a 22-date acoustic tour, was released in February 2018; The Sun Will Dance in Its Twilight Hour. After the tour they went into the studio for one day and tried to capture the onstage chemistry. They recorded everything and released it as a session album Stripped in January 2019. Damian announced he would be releasing a 5-track EP on his 50th birthday, 11 October 2019. The EP Thank You would be a return to a more classical approach of recording, just with piano and string orchestra.

The capital is Pedro Juan Caballero. The name comes from the name of a part of the Caaguaz√∫ Cordillera, \\"Amambai Mountains\\". Amambay is the name of a fern, typical of the forest in the region.  Districts  The department is divided in 5 districts: # Bella Vista # Capit√°n Bado # Karapa√≠ # Pedro Juan Caballero # Zanja Pyt√°  History  For a long time, the land was occupied by the natives of the region and suffered the attacks of the Bandeirantes that were looking for the Guaran√≠s, who were able to find refuge in the jungle of the area. After the Paraguayan War, vast expanses of land passed to the hands of foreign businessmen dedicated to exploiting yerba mate and lumber. Pedro Juan Caballero was found in 1893, and Bella Vista, in 1902. The department of Amambay was created in 1945 as the No. 10 department of the country. After some reorganization it was declared as the No. 13 department. The population in the area was consolidated with the establishment of rural colonies dedicated to agriculture and livestock industries. Pedro Juan Caballero, the capital of the department, is still known by its old name, Punta Por√°, used by the traveling merchants that transported yerba from Mato Grosso to Concepci√≥n.  Limits  Amambay is located in the north part of the Oriental Region of Paraguay. The exact geographic location is between the parallels 55¬∞ 28‚Ä≤ and 57¬∞ 00‚Ä≤ of West longitude and between meridians 22¬∞ 05‚Ä≤ and 23¬∞ 05‚Ä≤ of South latitude. The limits are: To the North: Brazil, from which is separated by the Apa River and Amambay Cordillera. To the South: Canindey√∫ Department To the East: Brazil, from which is separated by the Amambay Cordillera To the West: Concepci√≥n and San Pedro Departments  Climate  The average temperature is 21 ¬∞C; it reaches 35 ¬∞C in summer and drops to ‚àí1 ¬∞C in winter. The rainy months are January, February and March.  Orography and soil  In the territory are predominant, from north to south sandstone and rocks. Amambay is the highest of Paraguayan territories, it reaches 300 to 400 meters, and the Punta Por√° Hill reaches even 700 meters. The Amambay Cordillera serves as the natural limit with Brazil and from it parts the Serran√≠a Cerro Cor√°, Tacurupyt√°, Guas√∫, Alambique, Tuna and Tangar√≥. Some isolated hills are: Tranquerita, Tacuara, Ver√≥n Cu√© and Cuati√°.  Hydrography  The Apa River delimits the territory to the North, just as the Estrella Stream does with Brazil. The Aquidab√°n River and the streams Tapiracuai, Aquidab√°n-mi, Cabayu and Guaz√∫ are also in Amambay. The West of the department is bordered by the Ypan√© River and others such as Tutyt√≠, Aguaray Verde, Puente de la Tabla Puendy and Ypan√©-mi.  Natural environment  Cerro Muralla, \\"Wall Hill\\", in Amambay in the Cerro Cor√° National Park The entire department belongs to the Ecological Region of Amambay. The ecosystem has a great variety of fauna and flora. The richness natural resources in the region causes the department to be highly affected by deforestation. Some species of plants currently in danger of extinction include local palm tree species, karanday (Copernicia alba), array, Amambay fern, tr√©bol, yvyra paje, kai kygua, and local cedars. In addition, there are some animal species that are in danger too: agua‚Äôa sayju, jacar√© ita, and guasuti. The protected areas are: * Estrella Forest: 30.000 hectares * Pira‚Äôy Forest: 22.500 hectares * Guas√∫ Hill: 15.000 hectares * Saramb√≠ Hill: 15.000 hectares. Cerro Cor√° National Park was created by decree No. 20.698 on February 11, 1976, with a surface of 12.038 hectares. It is located in Pedro Juan Caballero's district.  Tourism  Pai Tavytera people in Amambay, 2012 Amambay is a department very favored by nature's beauty. Amambay Cordillera forms a chain of mountains: Cerro Cor√°, Tacur√Ω Pyt√°, Guas√∫ and Alambique. The most important hills are: Cerro Cor√°, located in the National Park, Acu√°, Lorito, Guas√∫, Muralle and Saramb√≠. In Cerro Cor√°, on the banks of Aquidab√°n Nigui River in 1870 an historic event took place: the death of Marshall Francisco Solano L√≥pez, in the Battle of Cerro Cor√°. In the National Park, there is a monument to him. In Cerro Guas√∫, Yasuk√° Ver√°, there are caverns and rests of human artifacts of archeological importance that date from 2.500 to 3.800 years ago. Tap√© Tuy√° is a road the remaining Paraguayan army took in the campaign of 1896‚Äì1870. The area was inhabited by colonies of natives of the Tup√≠ Guaran√≠ Family, the Pa√≠ Tavyter√° and Ava Guaran√≠. There is a hill in there that was considered to be a holy place by the Ava Guaran√≠. They thought it was the center of the earth, where the world was created and were born the first man and the first woman. In Pedro Juan Caballero, the beaches in the banks of Aquidab√°n River are places of great beauty and attract many visitors, just as do the commercial centers in the city. The beaches in Bella Vista are much visited by the tourists.  Economy  It is a territory of intense commerce because of its limitation with Brazil.

The first version of the character, Wally West, debuted in The Flash (vol. 1) #110 (1959). The character, along with others like the first Wonder Girl, Aqualad, and Speedy, was created in response to the success of Batman's young sidekick Robin. These young heroes would later be spun off into their own superhero team, the Teen Titans. As Kid Flash, Wally West made regular appearances in Flash related comic books and other DC Comics publications from 1959 through the mid-1980s until the character was reinvented as the new version of The Flash. Later, well after Wally West had made a name for himself as the new Flash, the character of Bart Allen, grandson of the second Flash Barry Allen, was brought into the past from his home in the future and served as the young hero Impulse. In 2003, with writer Geoff Johns' relaunch of a new Young justice volume, Bart donned the mantle of Kid Flash after being nearly killed by the assassin Deathstroke. As Kid Flash, Bart appeared in Teen Titans and The Flash (vol. 2) regularly until the Infinite Crisis event, where a disappearance of Wally West made Bart the fourth Flash. Apparently killed by the Rogues, Bart was resurrected in the 31st century by Legion of Super-Heroes member Brainiac 5 and retook the mantle of Kid Flash. Following a 2011 reboot, DC introduced a new interpretation of Wally West as its latest Kid Flash in 2014, who was later established as being the original Wally's younger cousin Wallace West. An amalgamation of Wally and Wallace West appears as the first live adaptation of Kid Flash in the Arrowverse, played by Keiynan Lonsdale. Fictional character biographies Wally West Wally West in his second Kid Flash costume, in The New Teen Titans # 31 (May, 1983). Art by George P√©rez. Outside of Iris West, Kid Flash was the first person to whom Flash revealed the secret of his double-identity (Flash #120, May, 1961). In that story, the two speedsters were inadvertently thrown 25 million years into the past, where they battled a race of golden humanoids. It was only the first of many time-trips for the pair, who teamed up next to try out Flash's Cosmic Treadmill.Flash #125, Dec. 1961 Shortly after meeting Flash's friend Elongated Man,Flash #130, Aug. 1962 Kid Flash received his own unique uniform. The Flash, who had been toying with a new design for Wally, was inspecting an alien mind over-matter machine when, in a burst of light, the new costume sprang from his mind and onto the body of his prot√©g√©.Flash #135, Mar. 1963 Since the new outfit exposed Wally's bright red hair, Flash provided his costume-storage ring with a special instant-dye spray with which he could easily change his hair color, as Wally, to brown.Flash #138, June, 1963 The boy speedster first met Robin and Aqualad in The Brave and the Bold #54 (June‚ÄìJuly, 1964), in an adventure that would predicate the formation of the Teen Titans shortly thereafter. Kid Flash remained a member in good standing of that team, though his participation limited his involvement in solo adventures considerably. At 18 Wally revealed his alter-ego to his parents Bob and Mary for the first time, chose his university (Taggart), and confided to the Flash his intentions to retire from superheroing upon graduation from college so that he might live a normal life. As it happened, he left his crime-fighting career behind even before that,New Teen Titans #39, Feb. 1984 when he retired from the third incarnation of the Teen Titans for personal reasons, including a desire to devote more time to studying, to his new girlfriend Frances Kane, and because, as a result of his changing metabolism, he was beginning to lose his powers. Kid Flash came out of retirement to fight in the Crisis on Infinite Earths, and was hit harder than anyone when the heroes found Flash's costume and ring and realized that their compatriot was dead. However, even though a blast from the Anti-Monitor reduced Wally's top speed to that of sound, it cured him of his metabolic malady. This, combined with the desire to honor his mentor and friend, caused Wally West to discard his Kid Flash identity and, instead, adopt the name and costume of Flash. However, after fully accepting that Barry was not returning, West removed a mental block, unlocking his true powers, making him faster than Barry Allen. He also acquired unique abilities such as sharing and stealing speed, and accessing the speed force itself, allowing time travel. When it was eventually discovered that Barry Allen was, in fact, alive, Wally took on his own version of the Flash costume, fighting alongside Barry Allen and his grandson, Bart Allen (Impulse or for a time Kid Flash). Bart Allen Bart as Kid Flash. Art by Mike McKone. Bart, the child from the future known as the hero Impulse, After Max Mercury disappeared in the timestream, Bart took up residence in Keystone City with Jay Garrick, the original Flash, and Jay's wife Joan. When a mysterious android from the future known as Indigo attacked the Titans and Young Justice, it resulted in the apparent deaths of Donna Troy and Omen. At Donna's funeral, Nightwing disbanded the Titans. The members of Young Justice, especially Wonder Girl, felt responsible for the tragic deaths.Titans/Young Justice: Graduation Day #1-3, 2003 This led Wonder Girl, Robin, Impulse and Superboy to form a new group of Teen Titans under the guidance of the more experienced Cyborg, Starfire and Beast Boy.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #1, July 2003 Despite Wally West's misgivings, Bart accepted an invitation to join the new Teen Titans.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #6, December 2003 Bart was later injured when Deathstroke put a shotgun to his leg. Thankfully, his accelerated healing enabled a handful of surgeons to replace his kneecap with an artificial one, and Bart was back on his feet in a matter of hours, but the effects of this encounter were much more than physical. Feeling unsure and tired of being underestimated, Bart went to the local public library and read every single book in the building. He retained that knowledge and balanced it with lack of experience. With a renewed sense of confidence, Bart left his impulsive rep behind and returned to the team as Kid Flash.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #4, October 2003 When Superboy-Prime ran amok during the Infinite Crisis, Kid Flash and the super-speedsters raced to stop his rampage. While running to subdue the deranged Teen of Steel, Wally West disappeared in a burst of lightning (later to return). Meanwhile, the speedsters' combined might defeated Superboy-Prime, but severed their connection to the Speed Force in the process. Bart returned to warn the heroes of Superboy-Prime's escape. But while mere moments had passed in the present, Bart returned from his time-bending journey four years older. Bart handed his grandfather's costume to Jay Garrick, claiming he used up all his speed powers during the final battle.Infinite Crisis #7, May 2006 Bart still had his powers, but faced with the guilt over Superboy-Prime's escape, he initially decided to retire his costume. He took a job as a factory worker in Keystone City, but soon realized he must use his abilities to protect innocents. Although Bart found new challenges in harnessing the speed force, he accepted his destiny as the latest Flash in the Allen family tradition. In his efforts to tame the speed force inside him, Bart turned to S.T.A.R. Labs intern, Valerie Perez, and their relationship quickly blossomed into a full-blown romance.The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive #1, June 2006 Once accepting the mantle of the Flash, Bart moved to Los Angeles, California and enrolled in the Police Academy. Robin asked him to join the Titans but Bart declined, saying he'd rather work towards membership in the Justice League of America. Shortly after resuming the mantle, Iris Allen warned Bart that if he fought the newly formed league of Rogues, he would not survive. Inertia, in a plan to steal the speed force energy for himself, manipulated the Rogues into battle with Bart. As a depowered Bart fought valiantly against the combined might of the Rogues, he saw the spectre of the Black Flash, and died as Iris Allen and Valerie Perez were left to mourn him.The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive #13, July 2007 Later on New Earth, during the Final Crisis story line, Superman was called to the thirty-first century to assist the Legion of Super- Heroes in fending off Superboy-Prime, who was thrown to the future in the aftermath of the destruction of Earth-51 and the Sinestro Corps War. Prime, raging about his minor place in history as a Superman rival, released the entire Legion of Super-Villains from the prison planet Takron-Galtos and waged war on Earth and the Legion. In response to this, Brainiac 5 summoned the Legions of Three Worlds (alternate earths) to combat Prime's forces. Revealing that the Legion had captured \\"living lightning\\" in the Legion's last trip to present Earth in The Lightning Saga, Brainiac 5 had Legionnaire XS run on the cosmic treadmill while the three Lightning Lads activated the \\"lightning rod\\" to release the living lightning. Although he tried to stop them, Superboy- Prime was unable to stop the lightning from being unleashed. A fully formed alive-and-well Bart Allen, in his Kid Flash uniform, appeared before him.Final Crisis: Legion of Three Worlds #3, Feb. 2009 When the New 52 universe began, the Kid Flash working with the Titans was known as Bart Allen. He ended up with a different backstory, and eventually was written out of the storyline. He was later replaced as Kid Flash by Wally's cousin, Wallace West.  Wallace West  Wallace West is the third Kid Flash of the main DC Comics Universe. He first appeared in The Flash Annual (Vol. 4) #3.

He was a brevet brigadier general in the Continental Army, the 20th and 24th Governor of Georgia, a U.S. Representative from Georgia, and the leading participant in the Patriot War of East Florida. Born in Augusta County in the Virginia Colony, Mathews was in early life a merchant and planter. As an officer in the colonial militia, he gained statewide fame for his role in the Battle of Point Pleasant of Dunmore's War. He was afterward elected to the House of Burgesses from Augusta County, but did not attend a session. On the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, he served as colonel of the 9th Virginia Regiment in the Continental Army. He and his entire regiment were captured on October 4, 1777 in the Battle of Germantown. Mathews spent the next four years as a prisoner of war, including two years on a British prison ship. He was brevetted brigadier general at the end of the war. After the war, Mathews moved to the state of Georgia and was quickly elected governor of the state. He served two nonconsecutive terms, voted to ratify the United States Constitution, and served in the 1st United States Congress. His second term as governor was overshadowed by his involvement in the Yazoo Land Fraud, which lead to his political downfall. Mathews relocated to the Mississippi Territory and in 1810 was sent as a secret agent by President James Madison to annex the Spanish territory of East Florida for the United States. Mathews was unable to claim the territory peacefully, so he created an insurrectionist force that captured Ferninanda Beach and Amelia Island and turned them over to the U.S. This act, now referred to as the Patriot War of East Florida, was denounced by Spain and its allies. Madison, under political pressure, disavowed Mathews' actions. The vagueness of Madison's instructions to Mathews have led to significant debate among historians as to whether Mathews acted outside of the purview of his mandate.  Early life  George Mathews was born on August 30, 1739, in Augusta County in the Virginia Colony to Ann (Archer) and John Mathews. His parents immigrated to America during the early years of the Scotch-Irish on 1717‚Äì1775.Waddell, p. 309 His father was an early and notable member of the Augusta County community, serving as a militia captain and de facto public officer.Waddell, p. 137, p. 309 The young George Mathews had ten siblings; six brothers and four sisters. He was \\"by far the crudest, most dynamic, energetic, colorful, and capable of the seven boys.\\"Herndon, p. 308 He may have been educated at the local Augusta Academy, although whatever schooling he obtained, he remained illiterate throughout his life.Herndon, p. 309 The young George Mathews played and explored in the woods around his father's farm,Patrick, p. 4 and quickly gained experience with frontier dangers from local Indian tribes, rebuffing raids from the Indians into the frontier settlement.Herndon, p. 309 On his father's death, Mathews was willed of farm landPatrick, p. 4 By the 1762, George and a brother, Sampson Mathews, had begun a mercantile enterprise in Staunton, Virginia, and soon had acquired extensive property along the western frontier as far west as the Greenbrier district. The brothers set up several outpost along this stretch, where they sold both frontier necessities and specialty goods, with their imports extending to Atlantic trade markets. The brothers additionally dealt in forced labor, mostly through contracts for convict servants from Ireland, but also African slaves.Herndon, p. 310 The brothers were among the \\"soul-drivers\\" in Virginia who bought convict servants wholesale from British transport ships at port, and traveled along established routes selling the convicts to farmers, planters, and others. Lodine-Chaffey suggests that the brothers' treatment of both convict servants and slaves was suspect, due to the frequency in which the servants and slaves escaped them; the brothers reported three slaves missing in 1769, and ten convicts missing in 1773. In total, their dealings in all ventures accounted for a \\"great share\\" of the trade in the region. The Mathews brothers were appointed trustees of Staunton in 1772. At this time, Staunton was an important trade center in the backcountry, and it along with other backcountry trade centers like Salisbury, North Carolina contributed significantly to economic expansion in the colonies, including the development of port cities like Baltimore, Maryland, Norfolk, Virginia, and Alexandria, Virginia. This mid-18th century economic boom has been cited a major origin of the American Revolution.Wood, p. 12‚Å†‚Äì16 Mathews took an increasingly active role civic affairs during this period. In Augusta County he served as a vestryman from 1763 to 1768, high sheriff from 1770 to 1771, and justice of the peace from 1769 to 1770 and 1773 to 1775. He was appointed a captain of militia in 1766.Herndon, p. 310‚Å†‚Äì311 Mathews first gained wider recognition for his role in the October 4, 1774, Battle of Point Pleasant. In the fall of 1774, Royal Governor Lord Dunmore assembled an invasion of Native American territory along the Ohio River, culling a thousand troops largely from the Virginia frontier. The Native Americans, under the Shawnee Chief Cornstalk, attacked Virginia militia, attempting to halt its advance into the Ohio Country. Rembert Patrick described the battle as \\"a typical Indian battle where every man found a tree, and military discipline in the English sense was unknown.\\"Patrick, p. 4 Mathews, dressed in a hunting shirt and moccasins, killed 9 Indians while sustaining no injuries.Patrick, p. 5 The tide of the battle turned when the militia enacted a flanking maneuver late in the day, initiating Cornstalk's retreat. Credit for this maneuver has typically been given either to Andrew Lewis or George Mathews.Herndon, p. 312 From his newfound celebrity, Mathews was elected to the House of Burgesses in 1775, though Governor Dunmore dissolved the assembly before it convened.Herndon, p. 314  American Revolutionary War  American forces lay siege during the Battle of Germantown Mathews eagerly sought a military commission on the outbreak of the Revolutionary War.Ebel On the creation of the 9th Virginia Regiment in the Continental Army in January 1776, he was commissioned lieutenant colonel. The regiment joined General George Washington's army in December 1776, in which it embarked on Washington's Philadelphia campaign. By February 1777, Mathews was promoted to colonel of the 9th Virginia Regiment.Herndon, p. 315 Mathews' regiment saw its first significant action during the September 11, 1777, Battle of Brandywine. The battle, fought between Washington's army and the British army of General Sir William Howe, was both the largest battle of the Revolution, with nearly 30,000 total belligerents, and the longest single-day battle of the war, with continuous fighting for 11 hours. The British defeated the Americans and forced them into a retreat that \\"nearly developed into a stampede.\\"Herndon, p. 316 Mathews' regiment was one of the last to leave the field of battle, causing some to credit him for saving the American army from rout.Herndon, p. 316 Following its victory, the British army set up camp in Germantown. On October 4, General Washington launched an attack on the British camp, initiating the Battle of Germantown. Mathews led a charge early in the day that resulted in the capture up to 100 British soldiers; however, as the day progressed Mathews penetrated so deeply into British lines that he became isolated from Washington's army and was engulfed by opposing troops. This resulted in the capture or death of his entire regiment,Herndon, p. 316‚Äì317 with Mathews claiming to have \\"bled from five wounds\\" during the ordeal.Patrick, p. 5 The given reasons for his capture vary; some claim he did not receive Washington's orders to retreat, while others claim his regiment became lost in the fog and smoke of battle.Herndon, p. 316‚Äì317 Nationally, he received acclaim and his reputation grew as a result of his daring.Herndon, p. 317 He spent much of the remaining revolution as a prisoner of war, first held at Philadelphia, and later on a prison ship anchored in New York harbor. The severity of Mathews' injuries caused a British surgeon to deem him \\"incurable.\\" Herndon, p. 317 Interior of By 1779, however, Mathews recovered was granted a limited parole and permitted to live in New York City. He wrote to Governor Thomas Jefferson and to the Continental Congress urging a prisoner exchange. Jefferson wrote to Mathews to explain his decision to leave him in New York City as a parolee and instead exchange for others still suffering in much worse conditions on the prison ships. Mathews turned his attention toward the improvement of living conditions for fellow prisoners of war, securing money and provisions for this aim from Congress and the State of Virginia.Herndon, p. 320 He was formally exchanged on December 5, 1781, at which point he was given command of the 3rd Virginia Regiment and went with Major General Nathaniel Greene into the southern theater, though he saw no further action in the war.Herndon, p. 320 Mathews was brevetted brigadier general at the end of the war; on September 30, 1783, Congress conferred a \\"general brevet\\" on the officers Continental Army, advancing all below the rank of major general by one rank.  Political career in Georgia During Mathews' military tour of the south, he had been impressed with the opportunities for political and financial gain on the Georgia frontier. When the 3rd Virginia Regiment was formally disbanded on January 1, 1783, he quickly petitioned the Georgia government for land, and received in Wilkes County.Herndon, p. 322 He liquidated his property and settled his business affairs in Virginia and headed to the new Georgia frontier. There he and his wife, Ann Polly Paul,Herndon, p. 309 built a log cabin in Goose Pond. They had eight children: John, Charles Lewis, George, William, Ann, Jane, Margaret, and Rebecca.Ebel His wife Ann Polly died a few years after their arrival to Georgia. Mathews briefly returned to Staunton, Virginia in 1790, where he married Margaret Reed, a widow. In 1793, Margaret went back to Virginia to visit friends and family, and when she later wrote to her husband to facilitate her return, he replied, \\"I didn't take you to Virginia, and I'm not going to trouble myself to go there and bring you back.\\" The two never reconciled, and the Georgia legislature granted a divorce on February 3, 1797.Herndon, p. 323 On the strength of his military reputation, Mathews quickly ascended to the top of Georgia state politics. He was appointed appointed a judge in Wilkes County, and a town commissioner for Washington, Georgia. Two years later, on January 2, 1787, he was elected a member of the Georgia General Assembly; three days after that, he was elected 20th governor of the state for a one-year term.Herndon, p. 322 Mathews' brief term as governor was a successful one; he attended the 1787 state convention in which he voted ratify the United States Constitution,Ebel and left with the state in a position of stability.Herndon, p. 324 He was then elected to the House of Representatives for the 1st United States Congress. His term in Congress has been called \\"lackluster,\\" owing in part to his 'frontier sensibilities' that were out of place in Congress.Herndon, p. 324 He was defeated for reelection in 1791, and launched a failed bid for the United States Senate the following year. However, by 1793, he had regained enough support to again be chosen the 24th governor of the state.Ebel His second administration was more tumultuous than his first. At this time, the State of Georgia struggled to defend its vast land claims in the western part of the state, and this led to notable controversies during Mathews' tenure.Lamplugh2 In February 1794, General Elijah Clarke, a popular veteran of the American Revolutionary War, illegally established the Trans-Oconee Republic as an independent state on western state hunting grounds reserved by the federal Treaty of New York (1790) for the Creek Indians.Floyd President Washington pressured Mathews to remove Clarke and his settlers from the Creek lands, but Mathews initially ignored the pressure, sympathizing with Clarke's aim and being aware of Clarke's local popularity as a hero of the Revolution. However, the tide of public opinion eventually changed,Floyd and in September, Mathews authorized 1200 Georgia militiamen, acting in conjunction with federal troops, to surround and isolate General Clarke's fortifications, leading to Clarke's surrender.FloydLamplugh, p. 64‚Äì68 The three areas that constituted the 1789 Yazoo land scandal. Mathews' involvement in the scandal lead to his political downfall. The Georgia legislature sought to relieve its burden of its unprotected western lands by encouraged purchase offers from private land speculators.Lamplugh2 When representatives from four private groups sought to buy 35 million acres extending to the Mississippi River at less than two cents per acre, Mathews initially rejected the proposal.EbelLamplugh2 However, the groups bribed many Georgia politicians to favor the bill, and this increased political pressure combined with waning popularity caused Mathews ultimately to accept and sign the Yazoo land bill.Ebel The public became outraged on learning the details of the bill, leading to protests to federal officials and Congressmen. Mathews, though he did not personally profit from the bill, became its public face.Herndon, p. 324 Jared Irwin and U.S. Senator James Jackson led the reform efforts. Irwin was elected governor of Georgia to replace Mathews, and on February 13, 1796, less than two months after taking office, he signed a bill nullifying the Yazoo Act.Lamplugh2 Mathews never again held a public office. He thought for a time about leaving the United States, and even wrote to George Washington asking for a character recommendation in preparation for his removal from the country, to which Washington obliged.Herndon, p. 324 However, in 1797, Mathews, who had by this time remarried again to Mary Carpenter, instead turned to the Mississippi Territory, where his wife owned property.Herndon, p. 326 Mathews again returned to land speculation, buying stock in a land company the claimant of extensive acreage in the territory. He also lobbied friends in Congress for a political appointment in the territory.Herndon, p. 325 In 1798, he was appointed the first governor of the Mississippi Territory by President John Adams. However, Secretary of War James McHenry objected to the appointment, citing Mathews' financial stake in the territory. When Adams withdrew the nomination, Mathews was reported to have responded: \\"Sir, if you had known me, you wouldn't have taken the nomination back; if you didn't know me, you should not have nominated me to such an important office.\\"Patrick, p. 7  Patriot War of East Florida  1806 John Cary map illustrates Spain's provinces of West Florida and East Florida. In November 1810, George Mathews learned from West Florida Governor Don Vicente Folch that Folch might be willing to peacefully transfer West Florida to the United States, on account of the weakening of the Spanish monarchy due to its involvement in the Napoleonic Wars.Cusick, p. 30 Mathews brought this to the attention to President James Madison, who wished to build on the expansionist policies of his predecessor, Thomas Jefferson. Madison, with ambitions raised, determined to annex both West and East Florida all at once.Cusick, p. 29 Madison and Mathews met in Washington D.C. in January 1811, to discuss strategy for carrying out the annexation. Madison gave Mathews \\"remarkably vague and general\\"Knott, p. 96 directions to incite a rebellion among Spanish subjects, if necessary, and in turn to accept any territories controlled by these rebel forces into the domain of the United States.Cusick, p. 29 Neither men took any notes about this meeting, with even the specific day of the meeting still unknown.Cusick, p. 30 Madison formally assigned Mathews and Indian agent John McKee as secret agents soon after, and they promptly headed south.Knott, p. 96Cusick, p. 30 Mathews and McKee created an intelligence network throughout East Florida, with Mathews writing to Secretary of State James Monroe frequently. Monroe in turn encouraged Mathews to continue so long as the opportunity remained realistic.Knott, p. 98 Over the weeks, however, Mathews would write many letters to Monroe that would receive no reply. Though unsettled, Mathews viewed this as an implicit endorsement of his plan, assuming the Madison administration was acting discreetly and desiring not to leave evidence of U.S. involvement.Knott, p. 99‚Äì100Cusick, p. 73 However, Madison historian J.C.A. Stagg suggests that the Madison administration followed an informal practice in which \\"silence implied not consent but its opposite.\\" This practice, which the administration did not explain, resulted in several misunderstandings with high-level officials throughout the Madison administration. Mathews became infected with malaria in the summer of 1811, and for weeks was beset to his house at St. Mary's, Georgia on the border of Georgia and Florida.Cusick, p. 57 Nevertheless, he wrote to Monroe in August 1811, stating his readiness to outfit a rebel force, and requesting supplies.Knott, p. 98 Mathews' plans were leaked to Spanish authorities late in the summer, and the Spanish government wrote to Monroe urging him to disavow Mathews' actions and place him in arrest. Monroe instead responded with justifications for American rights to East Florida, arguing \\"the United States should have seized on that country [East Florida] long ago\\" as collateral from unpaid debts from Spain to the U.S. He took the further step to publish this rationale in an official Madison administration newspaper.Cusick, p. 72‚Äì73 East Florida Patriot Flag, raised by the Patriot Army at Fernandina This confirmed to Mathews the Madison administration's support of his plans in lieu of direct correspondence, and additionally proved beneficial to his recruiting efforts. By the end of 1811, he had filled leadership positions for his rebellion with wealthy Spanish planters and businessmen.Cusick, p. 76 Still, he had not found enough local interest to fill out a fighting force. Mathews therefore turned to the recruitment of volunteers from Georgia to play the part of the his rebel Patriots.Knott, p. 100 By early 1812, Mathews' Patriots numbered about 125. To bolster his force, Mathews worked out a plan for 75 U.S. troops at the border to desert the U.S. army and enlist as Patriots, while Mathews would subsequently ensure their pardon and restoration to their prior military rank at the end of the mission.Cusick, p. 84 However, days before the Patriots were to cross into Florida, Major Jacint Laval‚ÄîMathews' housemate in St. Mary's -- discovered Mathews's plan to lure men of his division into desertion, and objected, raising alarm.Cusick, p. 86‚Äì87 Mathews then knew he did not have the numbers needed to take St. Augustine. Fearing his window for a surprise attack was closing, he turned his attention to the lightly guarded city of Fernandina on Amelia Island, just across the river from St. Mary's.Cusick, p. 91‚Äì92 He would take Fernandina, call in U.S. troops, and move to St. Augustine from there.Knott, p. 100 On the night of March 13, 1812, Mathews, with his Patriots and support from nine U.S. Navy gunboats, entered Florida, and quickly seized rural lands off the coast of Amelia Island. A rash of fighters defected to the Patriots, bringing their numbers to about 250, with about 59 being Spanish subjects.Cusick, p. 113 Mathews then began negotiations with Don Justo Lopez, commandant of the fort at Fernandina, for the surrender of the city. The Patriots gained control of Fernandina on March 16, without a shot fired.Patrick, p. 83‚Äì98 The Patriots raised a new flag of East Florida designed by a member of Mathews' staff, held the territory for 24 hours, and then turned it over to the United States.Cusick, p. 118 Mathews wrote to Madison of the mission's success, while also requesting additional U.S. military personnel in acknowledgment of the difficulty he had faced in galvanizing local support. Mathews also revealed to Madison his intention to similarly overthrow Spanish rule of the cities of Mobile and Pensacola in West Florida.Stagg, p. 292 The Madison administration's reaction By late 1811, James Madison had become convinced of the inevitability of war with Great Britain on the Canadian border (he would officially declare war with Britain in June 1812, setting off the War of 1812)).Cusick, p. 72 On learning of Mathews' request for further U.S. military support in Florida, as well as Spain's outrage towards the mission, Madison worried about the possibility of provoking Spain and its allies, the British, to join forces against the U.S.Knott, p. 102 Further, a scandal had broken in national newspapers about Madison's purchase of dirt on political opponents from a British secret agent in New England mere days before the news of Mathews' seizure of Fernandina broke in the papers.Cusick, p. 135‚Äì136 While Monroe in particular admitted \\"much cleverness\\" in Mathews's plan, and hoped to salvage his efforts, he and Madison agreed that the political costs of publicly supporting Mathews were at present were too high.Cusick, p. 138‚Äì139 Madison publicly repudiated Mathews, relieving him of duty on April 4, 1812.Knott, p. 102 Madison then assigned Georgia Governor David Mitchell as his new special agent in East Florida, tasked with keeping Mathews' Patriot army intact and preserving its military occupations.Knott, p. 102 Mitchell quickly informed East Florida Governor Juan Jos√© de Estrada that any attempt to drive out the Patriots would not be tolerated by the United States.Knott, p. 102 Mathews, furious with the Madison administration's repudiation, set off to Washington, D.C., where he'd \\"be damned if [he] didn't blow them all up.\\"Herndon, p. 328 However, on the way he suffered from a recurrent malarial fever and was forced to stop in Augusta, Georgia. He died there on his 73rd birthday, and is buried in Saint Paul's Church.Herndon, p. 328 Legacy and historical interpretations Historians have been divided over the legacy of the Patriot War of East Florida. Some conclude that Mathews overstepped his authority and deliberately departed from Madison's intentions,Stagg while others believe Mathews fulfilled Madison's intentions, and that Madison repudiated Mathews for political reasons.Owsley, p. 68Herndon, p. 327Cosick, p. 141 These differences in analysis are exacerbated by the fact that Madison and Mathews left no notes of their meeting to discuss the campaign.Cusick, p. 30 J.C.A. Stagg, in George Mathews and John McKee, Revolutionizing East Florida, Mobile, and Pensacola in 1812 (2007), states, \\"[i]t is now reasonably clear that the actions of Mathews and McKee in Florida and on the Gulf Coast between 1810 and 1812 departed far more from the policies of the [Madison] administration than they fairly reflected them,\\" and additionally deems the Patriot War, \\"an embarrassing and shameful moment in the history of early American foreign policy.\\" However, James G. Cusick, in The Other War of 1812 (2007), states, \\"[i]n truth, the administration's displeasure over an attack on East Florida rested on its timing and in the unfortunate publicity it received, not on the results.\\"Cusick, p. 141 G. Melvin Herndon draws a similar conclusion. In George Mathews, Frontier Patriot (1969), he states, \\"[i]t is generally agreed that Mathews was the victim of a vacillating administration whose dictates he had served faithfully according to his own lights. He succeeded too well; and, under pressure from several sources, President Madison and Secretary Monroe deemed it necessary to sacrifice Mathews to quell the criticism of their Florida policy. Similarly, Frank Owsley, in Filibusters and Expansionists: Jeffersonian Manifest Destiny, 1800-1821 states, \\"Mathews probably interpreted Madison's wishes accurately, and very likely had oral instructions from the government assuring him that his understanding of the orders was absolutely correct.\\" Paul Kruse, in A Secret Agent in East Florida: General George Mathews and the Patriot War (1952) observes that whatever Mathews' instructions, a letter from Mathews to Monroe, \\"written more than seven months before the invasion was actually attempted, fully disclosed General Mathews' revolutionary designs upon East Florida. Not to have checked the plan on such a notice made the government a party to them.\\" Stephen F. Knott, in Secret and Sanctioned: Covert Operations and the American Presidency (1996) states: \\"I believe Mathews' admission that he could not achieve the seizure of East Florida without additional overt American military support pushed the administration over the edge. Months of silent acquiescence by the Madison White House came to an end.\\"Knott, p. 101  Physical Appearance  Rembert Patrick describes his appearance during an 1811 meeting with James Madison as thus: :In one hand he held his old three-cornered cocked hat; he had on worn knee breeches, high-topped boots, and a shirt with little ruffles at the bosom and wrists. A sword, the symbol of his military valor, dangled at his side. He was short, thick-set, with stout muscular legs; he stood straight with his head thrown back, his red hair wind-blown, and his dark blue eyes framed by a weathered face.Patrick, p. 8 Memorials Several historical markers in the United States are dedicated to George Mathews. The Battle of Point Pleasant monument and memorial in Mason County, West Virginia lists him as a captain in the army of General Andrew Lewis. A marker stands at sight of his Georgia home, \\"Goose Pond\\", in Oglethorpe County, Georgia. Another marker, in Greene County, Georgia, stands at the sight of Fort Mathews, an outpost where Thomas Houghton wrote the report to George Mathews that lead to the fall of the Trans-Oconee Republic. A marker in Elbert County, Georgia acknowledges Mathews' role in settling of that county.

In the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model the following gauginos exist: * The gluino (symbol ) is the superpartner of the gluon, and hence carries color charge. * The gravitino (symbol ) is the supersymmetric partner of the graviton. * Three winos (symbol and WÕÇ3) are the superpartners of the W bosons of the SU(2)L gauge fields. * The bino is the superpartner of the U(1) gauge field corresponding to weak hypercharge.

As of 2017, no experimental evidence for Higgsinos has been reported.  Mass  If dark matter is composed only of Higgsinos, then the Higgsino mass is 1.1 TeV. On the other hand, if dark matter has multiple components, then the Higgsino mass depends on the relevant multiverse distribution functions, making the mass of the Higgsino lighter. ::mƒß ‚âà 1.1(Œ©ƒß/Œ©DM)¬Ω TeV  Footnotes  Supersymmetry Fermions Hypothetical elementary particles ","title":"Higgsino"},{"id":"715692","text":":For other people named Daniel Barringer, see Daniel Barringer (disambiguation). Daniel Barringer (May 25, 1860 ‚Äì November 30, 1929) was a geologist best known as the first person to prove the existence of an impact crater on the Earth, Meteor Crater in Arizona. The site has been renamed the Barringer Crater in his honor, which is the preferred name used in the scientific community. Also a small lunar crater on the far side of the Moon is named after him.  Early Life  Daniel Barringer, was the son of Daniel Moreau Barringer, a nephew of Confederate General Rufus Barringer and a cousin of Paul Brandon Barringer. He graduated from Princeton University in 1879 at the age of 19, and in 1882 graduated from the University of Pennsylvania's School of Law. He later studied geology and mineralogy at Harvard University and at the University of Virginia, respectively. In 1892, Barringer, along with his friend Richard A. F. Penrose, Jr., and others, purchased a gold and silver mine near Cochise, Arizona. Later, Barringer also discovered the Commonwealth Silver Mine in Pearce, Arizona. These mining ventures made him wealthy. Coon Mountain Crater In 1902 Barringer learned of the existence of a large (1.5 km in diameter) crater, located 35 miles east of Flagstaff, Arizona. The crater, known as Coon Mountain, had previously been studied by the geologist Grove Karl Gilbert in 1891. Gilbert had hypothesized that the crater must have been the result of either a gas explosion or a meteorite. After performing experiments in the crater, however, Gilbert's conclusion was that the crater could not be the result of an impact, and therefore could only be the result of an explosion. He concluded this despite the clear presence of thousands of small meteoritic particles in the vicinity of the crater. Upon hearing of the existence of the crater and the meteoritic iron, Barringer became convinced that the crater was of meteoritic origin. With both scientific and monetary aims in mind, Barringer created the \\"Standard Iron Company\\" in order to mine the crater for the iron that he assumed must be buried below its surface. The Standard Iron Company conducted drilling operations in and around the crater between 1903 and 1905, and concluded that the crater had indeed been caused by a violent impact. It was unable to find the meteorite, however.  Scientific results  In 1906, Barringer and his partner, the mathematician and physicist Benjamin C. Tilghman, presented their first papers to the U.S. Geological Survey outlining the evidence in support of the impact theory. The papers were published in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia.D.M. Barringer (1906). Coon Mountain and its Crater. Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Science of Philadelphia, 57:861-886. PDF By the late 1920s, Barringer had convinced most of the scientific community that his impact theory was correct. The theory has been further confirmed with new evidence since then, most notably by Eugene Shoemaker during the 1960s. The mining of the crater continued until 1929 without ever finding the ten-million ton meteorite that Barringer assumed must be hidden. By this point Barringer had spent over $600,000 with no iron profits to show for it, nearly bankrupting him. At this time the astronomer Forest Ray Moulton performed calculations on the energy expended by the meteorite on impact, and concluded that the meteorite had most likely vaporized when it landed.  Death  Barringer died of a heart attack on November 30, 1929, shortly after reading the very persuasive arguments that no iron was to be found. He was survived by his wife, Margaret Bennett, and eight children, who, with their descendants, formed the Barringer Crater Company[ , which owns the site to this day as a family business.

The capital is the city of Concepci√≥n.  History  Throughout history, this department has suffered a great amount of population instability, especially in the times of the colony, due to the advance of the Brazilian ‚Äúbandeirantes‚Äù through the east and the attacks of the Mbay√° ‚Äì Guaicur√∫ natives of Chaco, which, by then, were the lords of that region. During the later years of the colony, it was organized a great campaign to re-conquest the invaded territories with the intention of defending by populating the region and also with the important task of the Jesuit that founded the city of Bel√©n, of creating a Mission with the Mbay√° natives, in the year 1760. During the governments of Francia and L√≥pez, the populating process got stronger and the north area of Paraguay became a territory dedicated to cattle. Francia ordered the construction of the penal colony of Tevego in 1813 in the Concepci√≥n department. Once the Paraguayan War was over, Concepci√≥n united with Amambay, constituting a great territory for forestall and yerba plantations. In the Twentieth Century, Concepci√≥n was proclaimed to be the second most important city of the country and it became an active commercial center. Because of its bind with Mato Grosso it experienced important development during that time. In the year 1906, with the first plan to arrange the national territory, it was proclaimed the first department. Its limits were established with the decree 426 of 1973, as we know them nowadays.  Limits  Concepci√≥n is located in the central part of the oriental region of Paraguay, between the parallels 22¬∞00‚Ä≤ y 23¬∞30‚Ä≤ South and meridians 58¬∞00‚Ä≤ y 56¬∞06‚Ä≤ West. * To the North: The Federative Republic of Brazil, separated by the Apa River, from the mouth of the Paraguay River until the confluence with the Hermoso Stream. * To the South: San Pedro department, separated by the Ypan√© River from its confluence with the Guaz√∫ Stream until the mouth of the Paraguay River. * To the East: Amambay department, separated by a straight line that goes from the mouth of the Hermoso Stream with the Apa River to the beginning of the Chacalnica Stream and Negla, and the Aquidab√°n River to the confluence with the Guaz√∫ Stream. From this point another straight line to the confluence of the Ypan√©-mi and the Ypan√© rivers to their confluence with the Guaz√∫ Stream. * To the West: Presidente Hayes and Alto Paraguay departments, separated from them by the Paraguay River, between the mouths of the rivers Ypan√© and Apa.  Districts  The department is divided in 11 districts: # Azotey # Bel√©n # Concepci√≥n # Horqueta # Loreto # San Carlos # San L√°zaro # Yby Ya√∫ # Sargento Jos√© F√©lix L√≥pez # Paso Barreto # San Alfredo Note: The districts of Sargento Jos√© F√©lix L√≥pez, Paso Barreto and San Alfredo were created after the 2002 Census.  Climate  In summer, the temperature rises to 39¬∞ Celsius, and in winter, drops to 2 degrees Celsius. The media is 24 degrees Celsius. The rains can be about 1.324 mm. The rainiest months are November, December and January, and the dryer ones are June, July and August.  Orography and soil  The lands of this territory are of relatively elevation and even more close to the north and east frontiers, where they acquire the characteristic of true mountains. These are lands of calcareous origin, with a diversity of granite rocks and marble. The soil is very fertile. In the center and the north the land is a great territory for pasture, with woods and yerba fields. In the south, the lands are high, with little pendants and woods. To the north of the department, there is a succession of hills of low height; the elevations that are continuous form the Cordillera Quince Puntas, along with the mountain range of San Luis from north to south. The hills: Valle-mi, Medina, Pyta, Naranjahai, Itaip√∫ Guaz√∫ and Saramb√≠, destacate from others. Concepci√≥n's main church  Hydrography  The Paraguay river runs to the west of Concepci√≥n along with the minor rivers Apa, Aquidab√°n and Ypan√©, and the streams that bathe the territory are: Estrella, Sirena, Apam√≠, Primero, Quiensabe, Negla, Trementina, Chacalnica, Tapyangu√°, Pitanohaga, Guaz√∫, Mbui¬¥i, Ypanem√≠, Capiibary, Mboi Guaz√∫. The ports are: * Port Concepci√≥n * Port Vallem√≠ * Port Risso: it is mountain passes that produces lime, has rocky coasts, and have had several owners throughout history. There is an antique house built at the end of the 20th century, used to be a defense from the natives of Chaco, still stands in the place. * Port Fonciere: an important watch point over the Paraguay River. There is a house from the year 1927. * Por Max: port ‚ÄúTres Ollas‚Äù is nowadays a ganadero establishment, right in front of the Port Pinasco. * Port Arrecife: it has dangerous reefs. In time of bajada of the Paraguay River, it is ideal for fishing Dorado fish. * Port Abente: port of cattle ranches, previously called ‚ÄúPort Kemmerich‚Äù. It is near the Napeque Stream. * Port Pagani: today it is abandoned. * Port Negro: there are some cattle farms. * Port Algesa: for shipment of goods. * Port Antiguo: for passengers and shipment of goods. * Port Itapucum√≠: in front of the Port Pinasco. Here, the remains of the first lime factory of the country can be found, oldest even from the one in Vallem√≠. The administrative building of the factory works as a limestone quarry. There work lime ovens and shipments to Asunci√≥n are also made. There is an important watch tower over the Paraguay River and the Vallem√≠ area. * Port Itap√∫a: previously called ‚ÄúCalera Cu√©‚Äù. Located opposite Port Fonciere. It has lime ovens and shipping is made to all kind of places from there. Right in front there is an island with beautiful beaches. The population is mainly of working class; there are commercial businesses and a school built with limestone. * Port Guarati: is a famous limestone factory, about 10 km. from Port Itacu√°.  Nature and vegetation  Concepci√≥n is set in the ecological region of Aquidab√°n, a part of region of Amambay and another part in the region of the Central Forest. The deforestation is a big problem in this department because of the continuous advance of the human activity, creating a great shock to the natural resources of the region. One of the biggest problems is the uncontrolled hunting of animals in the area. Most of the forestall species are in extinction danger, as do the animals too. The ones that are in more risk of disappearing of the area are: the puma, yaguaret√©, gua‚Äôa pyt√° (red parrot), gua‚Äôa hovy (blue parrot), tuc√°n, tacua guaz√∫, mbo‚Äôi jagua, jacar√© overo and lobop√©. Some of the protected areas are: * The San Luis Mountain Range, with an extension of 70.000 hectares * Itapucum√≠, with an extension of 45.000 hectares * Estrella de Concepci√≥n, with an extension of 2.400 hectares * Laguna Negra, with an extension of 10 hectares, this area is in danger nowadays  Economy  In agriculture, the most important products are: cotton, sugar cane, maize, sesame seed, wheat and manioc. It is also important the production of locote, sweet potatoes, banana, pepper, t√°rtago, coffee, pineapple, grapefruit and ka‚Äôa he‚Äôe (a natural sweetener herb). The silviculture has diminished due to the massive deforestation in this region. The breeding of animals is the third production of the country, surpassed only by Presidente Hayes and San Pedro‚Äôs. The mortality rates for bovine cattle are relatively low. In Concepci√≥n is found the largest land of natural pasturing of the Oriental Region. There are also, porcine, ovine and goat cattle in important percentage. In Vallem√≠ is the Cement National Industry, which has 150 lime extractor plants by the Paraguay River. And near the Apa River quarries of marble are exploit. There are also other industries such as cold- storage plants, silos, mills and cotton gin industries.  Communication and services  The Paraguay River is the most important waterway, because is navigable most of the territory that coasts Concepci√≥n, almost 230 km. The Bioceanic Route cross through the department. The Route 5 \\"Gral. Bernandino Caballero\\" communicates with Pedro Juan Caballero and connects with Route 3 ‚ÄúGral. Elizardo Aquino‚Äù, that takes to Asunci√≥n. Another access to the department is through Pozo Colorado, a military depot, which connects with Route 9 ‚ÄúCarlos Antonio Lopez‚Äù, also known as \\"Transchaco Route\\", in the Paraguayan Chaco. There is 1.951 km of roads in the entire department; 720 km of them are paved and 146 km of pebbled roads, 362 interdepartmental roads cross it. The Mcal.

Cricket is the most popular and highest profile summer sport in New Zealand. New Zealand Cricket operates the New Zealand cricket team, organising Test tours and One-Day Internationals with other nations. It also organises domestic cricket in New Zealand, including the Plunket Shield first-class competition, the Ford Trophy domestic one-day competition and the Super Smash domestic Twenty20 competition David White is the Chief Executive Officer of New Zealand Cricket. Kane Williamson is the current Black Caps captain in all forms of the game, succeeding Brendon McCullum who retired in 2015. History On 27 December 1894, 12 delegates from around New Zealand met in Christchurch to form the New Zealand Cricket Council. Heathcote Williams was elected the inaugural president, and Charles Smith the secretary. The Council's aims were to promote and co-ordinate cricket in New Zealand and to organize international tours from and to New Zealand. Cricket development New Zealand Cricket has established High Performance Cricket training centre based at Lincoln University. It also operates a grassroots development programme for school children called 'MILO Kiwi Cricket'. John Wright, former NZ opening batsman, was appointed acting high performance manager for NZC in November 2007 before taking up the head coach position in December 2010. Former Australian Coach John Buchanan was appointed as NZC Director of Cricket in May 2011 as the architect of our new high performance programme. He will perform a number of key duties including the establishment of clear and consistent national coaching philosophies, implement a talent identification programme and oversee the Selection Panel. New Zealand has many private cricket academies. The Bracewell Cricket Academy based at Rathkeale College is one of the largest cricket academies, providing an Overseas Cricket Development Programme, a Pre- Season Coaching Camp and a Festival of Cricket. There are over 100,000 registered cricketers in New Zealand. By way of comparison, Australia and the UK have around 500,000 each. According to Mark O'Neill, New Zealand's batting coach from 2007‚Äì09, the competition at club level in NZ is nowhere near as intense as in Australia. > \\"In Sydney there are 20 first grade teams, each club has five grades.

It also organises domestic cricket in New Zealand, including the Plunket Shield first-class competition, the Ford Trophy domestic one-day competition and the Super Smash domestic Twenty20 competition. Teams New Zealand Cricket involves the following domestic teams: * Auckland Aces * Canterbury (known as Canterbury Kings for Twenty20) * Central Stags * Northern Districts (known as Knights for Twenty20) * Otago Volts * Wellington Firebirds Funding New Zealand Cricket derives most of its revenue from the sale of two types of broadcasting rights. # Broadcasting rights to home internationals. # A share of the broadcasting rights the ICC sells to its tournaments, such as the World Cup. Host nations pick up all the expenses of touring teams, but get sole access to all broadcast rights and gate receipts. In November 2007 it was announced that NZC had made a 5-year deal for the broadcasting rights to home internationals for NZ$65.4m with Sony Entertainment Television. The previous four-year deal between NZC and ESPN-Star was for only NZ$14.4m. Part of the 5-fold increase in value is due to the Indian team's tour of NZ in 2009. Immediately prior to the 2009 Indian tour of NZ the Sunday Star Times reported that \\"NZ Cricket hits $25m jackpot\\". The article claimed that NZ Cricket will get $1 million for each of the 22 days the Indians take the field and that NZ Cricket had insured against loss of income for the sale of TV rights due to bad weather. NZC boss Justin Vaughan also said that a tour by India generates \\"many times\\" more income than tours by Australia, South Africa and England and that the Indian tour was worth more to NZC than the payout from the Cricket World Cup, which was around $20m. The article also states that over the past two years, NZC's income has been around $30m, but this year (2009) Vaughan is hoping to get more than $40 million from broadcast rights, sponsorship and ticket sales. In 2007, the ICC sold the rights to broadcast the World Cup, the Champions Trophy and the ICC World Twenty20 to ESPN Star Sports until 2015 for US$1 billion. NZC will receive a slice of that. In November 2017, Star Sports acquired the broadcast and digital rights for New Zealand Cricket for all men's and women's international matches being organised in the country till April 2020 for the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.  Partnership with USA Cricket (2010)  On 19 December 2010, after months of negotiations, New Zealand Cricket announced it had signed a business deal with USACA which would see New Zealand play a certain number of games in the USA and also make its players available to participate in any Twenty20 leagues in the USA. A new company was created called Cricket Holdings America LLC. This new company will hold the rights to hold Twenty20 leagues within the United States. New Zealand Cricket chief Justin Vaughan said he was happy with the development because New Zealand was a small market and to exploit a market will allow New Zealand Cricket to secure its funding in the long-term and will also allow cricket to develop popularity as a game in the United States of America.

The capital is the city of Villarrica. It covers a surface of , with a population of 178,130 inhabitants (2002). One can arrive there by taking the Number 8 Blas Garay Road. It was founded on May 14, 1570, by Ruiz Diaz de Melgarejo.  History  Until circa the 19th century, the departmenti was called La Guayra or Guair√°, or also La Pineria (meaning \\"the Cury forests\\"); the region was under the jurisdiction of Cabildo de Asunci√≥n on the east of the Paraguay River until the line of the Tratado de Tordesillas. This place was also site of the first great Jesuit mission of Guayra, having the borders around the northern limits, the Paranapanema River, or according to other versions, the Tiete River, and the Iguazu River on the south. It used to be called Guayra o Guaira, a large territory that currently corresponds to the state of Parana. From the 16th to 18th centuries, the Spanish founded cities (Ontiveros, Ciudad Real del Guayra, Villa Rica del Espiritu Santo), and the Jesuits founded some reservations, also under the Spanish jurisdiction, such as San Ignacio Guazu, Santa Maria del Iguazu (which is today Foz do Iguacu) Pirapo, Loreto, etc. Such cities were devastated by the bandeirantes, and they had to migrate a great part of the population to the west of the Parana River (where Villa Rica was re founded-the current-day Villarica) or to the south of the Iguazu River (where San Ignacio was re founded-with the name of San Ignacio Mini and Loreto among others). The Guayra Waterfall (or Salto Canendiyu), called Salto das Sete Quedas by the Brazilians, on the Paran√° River, almost to the crossing with the parallel 24¬™S, was the natural navigation limit of the river. The current-day Paraguayan city called Salto del Guaira, and the Brazilian Guaira, indicate the approximate place where the beautiful and famous waterfalls are, covered by the waters of the Itaipu Dam since the 1980s. The Brazilian occupation of the Guair√° region was decided in 1870, at the end of the Paraguayan War, being later baptized with the name of Guaira, to the small department located in the center of the Eastern Region, in a territory which was not included in the original Guayra.  Location  The departament is in the central area of the Eastern Region, whose name comes from guai: boys and ra: place, and is one of the richest and most fertile departments of the country. Its border to the north is the department of Caaguazu, to the east Caaguazu and Caazapa, to the south Caazapa and to the west is the department of Paraguari. A branch of the Caaguaz√∫ hills enter into the department, going from East to West, receiving the name Monte Rosario. On the far west forms the Villarica or Ybytyruzu hills. The department has 17 districts. The last one, Doctor Bottrell, was created in 1983.  Districts  The department is divided in the following 18 districts: # Borja # Mauricio Jos√© Troche # Colonia Independencia # Coronel Mart√≠nez # Dr. Botrell # F√©lix P√©rez Cardozo # General Eugenio A. Garay # Itap√© # Iturbe # Jos√© Fassardi # Mbocayaty # Natalicio Talavera # √ëum√≠ # Paso Yobai # San Salvador # Villarrica # Yataity # Tebicuary  Geography  In the department there are three natural zones that are very well differentiated. The first zone, near the Villarica or Ybyturuzu, hills, there are high lands and forests that are woody with steep slopes. The second zone, the central west, has fertile lands. In the southwest part one can find the third zone, the most fertile and populated area. Its large plains are good for raising cattle. Besides the Ybyturuzu hills, we can also find the hills of Pelado, Polilla, Itape, Leon, Cerrito and Tres Kand√∫, with 848 m, the highest peak in the country. The Guaira is surrounded by the Tebicuary River and its tributaries, like the Tebicuari-mi with many streams such as the Yhaca Guazu, Yhaca-mi, Aguapety, Guazu, and Tacuaras. Also, the Pirapo-guazu River and the Pirapo-mi stream are found in the area. In other zones of the department, we can find the Bobo, Orory, Mita√¨, Caundy, Do√±a Juana and Paso Pindo streams.  Weather  The department has mild and good weather, with an average temperature of 21 degrees Celsius. In the summer, the maximum temperature is 38 degrees, and in the winter, the temperature goes down to 1 degree. It rains a lot during October and November. During the year, there is a total of 1,537 millimetres of rain.  Demography  Out of a total of 161,991 inhabitants, 47,300 lived in the areas, and 114,691 in rural areas.  History  The history of the department is intimately linked to the foundation and history of its main city, Villarrica. The city of Villarrica del Espiritu Santo was founded by Ruy Diaz de Melgarejo on May 14, 1570 in ancient Guaira, which today is in Brazilian territory. After being persecuted and the attacked by the Bandeirantes, the city suffered a migratory process which took people to seven different sites before finally being established in 1682 near the Ybyturuzu River, where it is currently located. The Franciscan missionaries helped with the process of consolidation, and in 1686 they founded a Guarani reservation in the Itape zone. In 1906, the 5th department was created, composed of Villarrica in addition to Itape, Hiaty, Mbocayaty and Yataity. During the 20th century, there was great exploitation of the forest as well as the Yerba mate in the zone, which is closely linked to the rich region of the Caaguaz√∫ Department. Villarrica became a very important urban center, as the train crossed from East to West through a great part of the department's territory, which contributed as a means of communication in the department's development.  Flag  The flag is divided in two horizontal zones of similar dimensions. The upper zone, a light blue, is related to the water and the sky; the lower zone, a red, symbolizes the grapes. The colors also reconfirm the range and category of the Catholic Church's supreme hierarchies.  Shield  The shield is divided into four parts, where there is a typical colonial-style house, and the zone's landscape, which includes the Ybyturuzu mountains, grapes and the sugar cane plant. There is also a book, with the Roman numerals corresponding to the department of Guaira. Also, one can see shapes referring to nature. In the center of the shield there is a butterfly, which is a reference to panambi. The bottom of the shield says \\"Tradition Culture\\".  Economy  Guair√° is a predominantly agricultural department. It is the country's most important sugar cane producer, with 41% of the national output; it is also the main producer of Paraguayan wine. Other crops include cotton, soybean, maize, vegetables and fruits. The indiscriminate felling of the forests has reduced the forest activity; nevertheless, the department possesses sawmills and factories for cabinet-making etc. The industrial activity is marked by vintners, herbal mills, alcohol distilleries, footwear industries, scale factories, dairy industries and tanneries.  Communication ways  The Departament contains the Number 8 Blas Garay Road, which starts in Coronel Oviedo from the Number 2 and 7 Roads, and is paved until Caazapa. From the √ëumi district there is another paved part that connects to San Juan Nepomuceno. It also has other paved roads: Villarica‚ÄìParaguari, through Felix Perez Cardozo and Coronel Martinez, Mbocayati-Independencia, with an extension of 50 km, and another way that connects the Number 7 Road through Natalicio Talavera, Troche and Colonia Blas Garay. Guaira also has aerial communication, telephones and telegraphs. There are many roads that cross the territory in all directions.  Education  From the founding of the city of Villarrica del Esp√≠ritu Santo, work on education began and hasn't stopped since. Starting in 1585, the Franciscans opened a convent in the city of Santa Barbara, and elementary and secondary schools were attached. In the 17th century, the Paraguay province had free courses in grammar, Philosophy and Sanctity in Asunci√≥n and Villarica, under the direction of the Franciscan, Dominican, Merced, and Jesuit priests. The first teaching center, sustained by the state of Villarica, dates back to 1859, and was named Escuela Patria. Nowadays, the superior education in the department is represented by Universidad Cat√≥lica \\"Nuestra Se√±ora de la Asunci√≥n,\\" and Universidad Nacional de Asunci√≥n in the north. In Guair√°, there are many schools and institutes, private as well as public, such as Colegio Nacional, Colegio Ortiz Guerrero, Colegio Tecnico Vocacional, Seminario Diocesano, Escuela Regional de Agricultura, Instituto Professional Femenino, Escuela de Artes and Oficios Pio XII. There are also various pre-school centers and Humanistic high schools, as well as Technical ones. Another educational entity is the Institute of Guaran√≠ Linguistics, Idelguap, which teaches the Guarani language, literature, and folklore. There is also, with similar goals, the Ateneo of Guaran√≠ Language and Culture and Guaran√≠ Roga.  Art and Culture  The main guaire√±a city, Villarrica, is considered the largest city in the department. Among the social, cultural and sports entities, there are \\"The Porvenir Guaire√±o,\\" \\" El Centro Espa√±ol,\\" \\"El Club de Leones,\\" \\" Instituto de Cultura Hisp√°nica,\\" \\"Teatro Municipal,\\" \\"Orquesta de C√°mara,\\" \\"Escuela Municipal de Danzas, Declamaci√≥n, Oratoria, Guitar,\\" \\"Asociaci√≥n de Productores de Ca√±a de Az√∫car,\\" \\"Liga Guaire√±a de F√∫tbol\\" y \\" Liga Guaire√±a de Basquetbol.\\" In 1970, the Socioeconomical Development Center of Guaira was created, formed by public and private entities, which supports the department's economic, social and cultural development. The Ybyturuzu Foundation, an environmental organization, attempts to spread consciousness throughout Guair√°'s population to keep, protect and defend the important ecosystem of the area. In the city there are a few radio stations, closed circuit television, cable TV and channel 8. In terms of their intangible culture, the guire√±os keep a repertoire of different popular myths and legends, such as pora, pombero, jasy jatere, kurupi, urutau, karau, and jakare, among others. Among the European traditions, they have the patronal parties, day of the cross, corridas de toros, horse races, and ri√±as de gallos.  Tourism  Guair√° has one of the most emblematic and representative cities of the Paraguayan culture: Villarica. In Villarica, nature is a friend and trusts the human beings who live there, or the ones who are attracted by its fame for being a paradise and who decide to wander about its geography, to know its history and to drink from its culture. One of the most widely visited places in the city is the Manuel Ortiz Guerrero Park, which before 1936 was known as Ycua Pyta. Here you can feel the soul of Villarica like no other place in the city. The calm nature of the place helps one to forget the activities of daily life. It is an ideal place for the soul and the body. The Manuel Oritz Guerrero Park is located in the northeast area of the city, between the Ybaroty and San Miguel neighborhoods. At the beginning of the 1960s a sculpture was made by Javier Baez Rolon to commemorate a Villariquean poet. On May 8, 1983, for the 50th anniversary of the poet's death, his ashes were moved to the park, fulfilling the citizens' dream. From that day on, under the shadow of a tree, the poet rests in peace in the land of his soul. His poetry still vibrates under the look of his beloved Ybytyruzu. Other cultural centers that one must visit are the Maestro Fermin Lopez Museum and the Library, where one can find the personal belongings of Natalicio Talavera, Fermin Lopez, and Manuel Ortiz, as well as weapons from the Chaco War, a collection of coins and Paraguayan bills, and arrows and axes made by the native peoples. In the museum one can see, among others, very old objects, old furniture, old machines, paintings, photographs, and different sacred art donated by the Church of Villarica. In the district of Itape there is a sacred place named the \\"Paso de la Virgen,\\" whose festival is celebrated on December 18. Its sanctuary on the side of the Tebicuary-mi River is visited by thousands of pilgrims during the year. Another tourist attraction is the Cristal Waterfalls, which are 43 meters high. Below the waterfalls there are many different colored fish, and a beautiful forest surrounding them. On the Tororo hill one can see runic inscriptions, said to be from the Vikings from the Pre-Columbian times. Lovers of the ao poi embroideries can enjoy beautiful samples in the Mbocayaty and Yataity districts.  Notable residents  Ruy D√≠az de Guzm√°n (1554‚Äì1629) Bold conqueror.

He learned to play the harp from anonymous older harpists from his region. His special quality of playing an instrument, together with his strong personality, gave him the chance to visit cultural centers in different countries: Argentina, Uruguay, Chile. He was considered the richest composer in Paraguay. He created 87 musical compositions, among them polcas, guaranias, songs, galopas, milongas, zambas, cuecas, boleros, tangos and chacareras.

Fried dough is also known as fry dough, fry bread (bannock), fried bread, doughboys, elephant ears, scones, pizza fritte, frying saucers, and bu√±uelos (in the case of smaller pieces). These foods are virtually identical to each other and some yeast dough versions of beignets, and recognizably different from other fried dough foods such as doughnuts or fritters. In Canadian cuisine, pieces of fried dough are sometimes called beaver tails. According to Bill Castleman, a writer of books on Canadian word origins, the name referred to quick-baked dough \\"especially in early 19th-century places where people might camp for one night and where there was no frying pan.\\"Russell Frank (1898) Explorations in the Far North University of Iowa. p. 39. In 1978, Pam and Grant Hooker of Ottawa, Ontario, founded the BeaverTails chain of restaurants specializing in the sale of fried dough pastries which are hand stretched to the shape of a beaver's tail. In Newfoundland, a province in Eastern Canada, fried dough is referred to as a \\"touton\\". A touton /Ààta ät…ôn is produced by frying bread dough on a pan with butter or the leftover fat from \\"scrunchions\\" (fried preserved pork) and served with dark molasses, maple syrup, or corn syrup. It is traditionally made from leftover bread dough and pan-fried, as opposed to deep-fried. A smaller Italian variant common in North America is the zeppole. Similar food is found in Europe, also typically from outdoor stands in fairs. For example, in Croatia, fried dough is known as langu≈°i, in Hungary as l√°ngos, in Austria as kiachl, in Germany as Kniek√ºchle while the oliebol is eaten in the Netherlands. In north Spain is typical of Carnival season and has a spiritual connection with it, just like 'rosc√≥n' in Christmas or 'arroz con leche' in Easter. A type of soft, fried dough ball frequently coated in sugar can be found in some Chinese restaurants in New York. These dough balls are referred to by any one of a number of names, including but not necessarily limited to \\"sugar biscuits\\", \\"Chinese doughnuts\\", or the simpler \\"fried bread\\". Turkic countries in Central Asia also have a similar food called Boortsog or Pi≈üi. Preparation Fried dough is made by deep-frying a portion of risen yeast dough. The dough acquires an irregular, bubbly appearance from being fried. The dough may then be sprinkled with a variety of toppings, such as granulated sugar, powdered sugar, cinnamon, fruit sauce, chocolate sauce, cheese, maple syrup, whipped cream, tomato sauce, garlic butter, lemon juice, honey, butter, nuts, or a combination of these.

The river flows from the Aarkanaal in Nieuwveen northwards to the IJ in Amsterdam.  Etymology  van Amstel from 1189 The name Amstel is derived from Amestelle, which is a compound of the words aam meaning water and stelle meaning solid, high, and dry ground. In the 12th century, the name was used for the area or gouw that is closed in by the rivers Amstel and Bullewijk and the bay IJ. The river Amstel was named after this area.G. van Berkel & K. Samplonius, \\"Amsterdam (Amsterdam, NH)\\" (in Dutch), Nederlandse plaatsnamen verklaard, 2018. Retrieved on 10 October 2020. Course  Source  The Amstel begins where the canal Aarkanaal and the river Drecht meet, just north of the village Nieuwveen in the province of South Holland. Here the river forms the border between the provinces of South Holland and North Holland and flows in northeastern direction.  Amstelland  Amstel near Nes aan de Amstel, between Uithoorn and Amstelveen The Amstel passes the hamlet Vrouwenakker and is then joined by the tributary river Kromme Mijdrecht. On the northern bank is the town Uithoorn and on the southern bank is the village Amstelhoek. Here the river forms the border between the provinces of Utrecht and North Holland. Further on, the river is joined by tributary river the Oude Waver. From here onwards, the river flows northward through the province of North Holland. The Amstel passes the village Nes aan de Amstel. On the western bank is the town Amstelveen, where there is a small island in the river named Amsteleiland, and on the eastern bank the town of Ouderkerk aan de Amstel, where the river is joined by the tributary river Bullewijk. After this the Amstel flows into the city of Amsterdam.  Amsterdam  Amstel near the Rembrandt Tower in Amsterdam In Amsterdam, the canals Duivendrechtsevaart and Weespertrekvaart are tributaries to the Amstel. There are several historical bridges crossing the river, among which are the Berlagebrug, Magere Brug, and Blauwbrug. In the city center, the river is connected to several city canals, which are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Amstel Hotel, Royal Theater Carr√©, Hermitage Amsterdam, city hall in the Stopera, and Allard Pierson Museum are located on the eastern bank of the river. The river is interrupted at Rokin that is partly filled up, Dam Square, and Damrak that is partly filled up. The city of Amsterdam took its name from the dam in the river Amstel.  Mouth  The original course continues with Damrak, after which it passes Stationseiland, an artificial island with Amsterdam Centraal station, and flows into the former bay IJ.  Cultural events  A nationally televised concert is held on the river every year on Liberation Day. The rowing races Head of the River Amstel and Heineken Roeivierkamp are held on the river annually.

Life He was born in about 1494, at Dudley Castle, Worcestershire, the eldest son and heir of Sir Edward Sutton, 2nd Baron Dudley and his wife Lady Cicely (Willoughby) Sutton. He was betrothed to Lady Cecily Grey (a daughter of Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset, by Cecily, his wife, suo jure Baroness Harington and Baroness Bonville) by 30 October 1501, whom he subsequently married. He was knighted 13 October 1513. He succeeded his father Edward Sutton, 2nd Baron Dudley as Baron Dudley in 1532 and immediately began to sell his patrimony, including half of Powis Castle. He was never summoned to Parliament. He acquired the nickname \\"Lord Quondam\\" (\\"Lord Has-been\\" or \\"Lord Formerly\\") when he allowed his estate, including the castle of Dudley, to fall into the possession of his cousin, John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland. The Duke resided at Dudley Castle and added new and magnificent structures to the old fortress. After Northumberland's execution, Dudley Castle was forfeited to the crown, and in 1555 was restored by Mary to Lord Quondam's eldest son, Edward Sutton, 4th Baron Dudley. Dugdale wrote: \\"It is reported by credible tradition of this John Lord Dudley, that being a man of weak understanding, whereby he had exposed himself to some wants, and so became entangled in the usurer‚Äôs bonds, John Dudley, then Viscount Lisle and Earl of Warwick (afterwards Duke of Northumberland), thirsting after Dudley Castle, the chief seat of the family, made those money merchants his instruments to work him out of it, which by some mortgage being at length effected, this poor lord became exposed to the charity of his friends for a subsistence, and spending the remainder of his life in visits amongst them, was commonly called the Lord Quondam.\\" There is much evidence in the Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII to suggest that Warwick and Cromwell between them colluded to entangle Lord Dudley before the fact, and did not simply take advantage of him afterwards, as suggested by Dugdale's sources. Family Lord Quondam had several brothers: Thomas, William, Arthur, Geoffery and George. Lord Dudley decided upon a city residence at Tothill Street in Westminster. He died in Middlesex and was buried on 18 September 1553 in St Margaret's, Westminster, London; his wife was buried there on 28 April 1554.J. G. Nichols, ed., Diary of Henry Machyn, Camden Society, (1848), p. 398. It is a perhaps not insignificant detail to add that his cousin and nemesis John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland was executed on 22 August the same year, 1553. His children included Edward, Captain Henry (Knt.), George, Margaret, Thomas, Dorothy, Elizabeth, and Robert.

History  The territory which forms this department is located in a valley formerly called \\"Yarigua'a\\" that was part of the mission of Jesuit priests in the era of colonization. Numerous villages existed in this area, whose inhabitants were influenced by priests and chaplains responsible for directing agricultural and livestock activities. Part of the territory was occupied also by the Dominican missionaries who were responsible for \\"Tavapy\\" with black people. At the end of the 16th century, the Franciscan missionaries founded the city of Yaguar√≥n with indigenous Guaran√≠. The development of the new population was consolidated in the 17th century and civilians took shape in the 18th century. Foundations followed on which today form part of this department. In 1725 Carapegu√° was founded, in 1733 Quiindy, 1766 saw the founding of Ybycu√≠, in 1769, Piray√∫ The current capital of the department, Paraguar√≠, was founded in 1775. Subsequently, Quyquyh√≥ was founded in 1776, Ybytim√≠ and Acahay in 1783 and was founded Caapuc√∫ in 1787. During the government of Don Carlos Antonio L√≥pez this territory benefited by the opening of railways in 1854. Once the Paraguayan War, the tracks reached Villarrica, which generated the founding of new cities like Cerro Le√≥n, Escobar, Sapucai and General Bernardino Caballero. Over time, people formed two lines, which were on the brink of the route and those who were along the railroad tracks. This situation contributed to the formation of two separate departments in 1906, Quiindy with the cities of Paraguar√≠ and routes that was formed by the towns of Carapegua, Tavapy, General Bernardino Caballero, Escobar, Yaguar√≥n, Piray√∫, Ypacara√≠ and Itaugu√°, the latter two belonging to the department at present Central. In 1945 the division policy changed, establishing the department of Paraguar√≠ IX as it is currently.

Economy  This department is rich in livestock production. Its inhabitants are principally engaged in raising cattle and pigs, on a smaller scale are breeding sheep, horses and goats. Poultry production also occupies an important place in production, are raised chickens, geese, turkeys and guineas. Agricultural production plays a less important and is geared primarily to supply its own inhabitants.

The privately held company was founded around 1969 by A. Neil Pappalardo, Morton E. Ruderman, Curtis W. Marble, Jerome H. Grossman, and Edward B. Roberts. History In 1969, Antonino Neil Pappalardo began development of the programming language MIIS. This was one of several proprietary implementations of MUMPS, a programming language which at the time had not been standardized. In July that year, Pappalardo and Morton E. Ruderman, Curtis W. Marble, Jerome H. Grossman and Edward B. Roberts founded the company, with a $500,000 investment from EG&G.; MIIS users and developers later influenced efforts toward MUMPS standardization during the early 1970s; the MUMPS standard was complete by 1974 and approved by 1977. Between 1971 and 1979, Pappalardo developed various other systems, but those associated with integrated health care information remained his primary focus. In 1982, Meditech adopted the then-new MAGIC programming language for its health care information systems. In 1994, the company adopted client/server, a second software platform. While client/server utilized the same programming language, MAGIC runs all code on a central server, and clients are in effect dumb terminals. Client/server executes the code on a user's PC, although all code remained centralized. Client-server supports only Microsoft Windows-based operating systems. Meditech announced its version 6.0 in 2006. In 2003, Howard Messing was named president, and in 2010 also became chief executive officer. After peaking in 2012 at almost $580 million, revenues fell to about $476 million by 2015. On January 29, 2020, Meditech announced the launch of Expanse Patient Care, a web-based application software that allows nurses and therapists to conduct administrative tasks through a mobile device.Meditech launches web-based EHR mobility tool for nurses, www.beckershospitalreview.com. Markets Meditech expanded from the United States and Canada into the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, and several other communities, including the Spanish- speaking world. Products and services Meditech offers software for health care organizations of various types and sizes. Some of the software modules include: health information management, revenue cycle, scanning and archiving, scheduling and referral management, emergency department management, cost accounting, data repository, general accounting, human resource planning, supply chain management, operating room management, patient discharge instructions, long term care, behavioral health, and home health.

To accommodate the convention and its set-up, the Houston Astros, the Major League Baseball team which played at the Astrodome, played 26 consecutive away games over 28 days, the longest Major League Baseball \\"road trip\\" since the Philadelphia Phillies played 27 away games in 28 days in 1944. Additionally, the National Football League's Houston Oilers would also be forced to play all their preseason games on the road. Overview The convention is notable in that it featured the last major address of the long political career of former President Ronald Reagan, Bush's predecessor. In his speech, Reagan told Americans that: > Whatever else history may say about me when I'm gone, I hope it will record > that I appealed to your best hopes, not your worst fears, to your confidence > rather than your doubts. My dream is that you will travel the road ahead > with liberty's lamp guiding your steps and opportunity's arm steadying your > way. My fondest hope for each one of you‚Äîand especially for the young people > here‚Äîis that you will love your country, not for her power or wealth, but > for her selflessness and her idealism. May each of you have the heart to > conceive, the understanding to direct, and the hand to execute works that > will make the world a little better for your having been here. Ronald Reagan addresses the delegates (excerpt) As the economy was in a recession and domestic affairs in general had dramatically decayed, the GOP lagged in the polls by double digits behind the Bill Clinton-Al Gore Democratic ticket after a successful Democratic Convention, and with Ross Perot temporarily out of the race, the Republican Party worked hard to rally its base of social conservatives. Pat Buchanan's opening night \\"Culture War\\" speech argued that a great battle of values was taking place in the United States. Republican National Committee chairman Rich Bond (referring to Democrats) claimed that \\"we are America, they are not America.\\" Marilyn Quayle dismissed Bill Clinton's claim to a new generation of leadership by saying, \\"Not everyone demonstrated, dropped out, took drugs, joined in the sexual revolution or dodged the draft.\\" Regarding Buchanan's speech, liberal humorist Molly Ivins quipped that it \\"probably sounded better in the original German.\\"New York Times, Feb 1, 2007 Molly Ivins, Columnist, Dies at 62 Twenty years after the convention, the New York Times wrote, \\"Supporters of Mr. Bush pointed to the tone of the convention as one of the reasons he lost re- election that November to Bill Clinton,\\"Negournay, Adam (August 29, 2012) \\"From the Fringe in 1992, Buchanan's Words Now Seem Mainstream.\\" New York Times. (Retrieved 8-29-12.) as it centered more on Reagan-era values and Bush's international credentials at a time that the main issue was the domestic crisis. The fact that the now-infamous \\"No new taxes\\" pledge had haunted the President for the last three years, the economy was barely mentioned. AIDS activist Mary Fisher, who has HIV, addressed the convention, making an eloquent plea for her cause. (She also addressed the 1996 RNC). Her 1992 speech was listed as #50 in American Rhetoric's Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century (listed by rank). During his acceptance speech, President Bush thanked former President Richard Nixon for his advice and contributions to the administration's foreign policy. This would be Nixon's last RNC, as he died in 1994. Aftermath The convention energized the Republican base, giving the Bush-Quayle ticket a bounce in the polls.The 1992 Campaign; Bush's Gains From Convention Nearly Evaporate in Latest Poll ‚Äì New York Times As the bounce faded, the race returned to a lopsided double-digit Clinton‚ÄìGore lead.The 1992 Campaign; The Race in Different Polls ‚Äì New York Times The race narrowed considerably, however, when Ross Perot rebooted his insurgent campaign.The 1992 Campaign: Poll; Poll Finds Hostility to Perot And No Basic Shift in Race ‚Äì New York Times The major parties have avoided hosting their conventions at baseball stadiums since then, now holding them in non sports venues (such as convention centers) and venues for teams whose seasons are not currently in play at the time of the convention.

The capital is the city of Villa Hayes. The department was named after U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes, who awarded the territory to Paraguay while arbitrating a boundary dispute between Paraguay and Argentina after the Paraguayan War.  Districts  The department is divided into eight districts: # Benjam√≠n Aceval # General Bruguez # Jos√© Falc√≥n # Nanawa (Puerto Elsa) # Puerto Pinasco # Teniente Esteban Mart√≠nez # Teniente Primero Manuel Irala Fern√°ndez # Villa Hayes # Pozo Colorado  History  In the colonial period, conflicts between settlers and native tribes resulted in the abandonment of towns and missions including Melod√≠a, Timb√≥ (Paraguay), Naranjajay, and Remolinos (Paraguay). Only Fort Borbon, today called Fort Olimpo, survived. Founded during the government of Joaqu√≠n Al√≥s y Br√∫, the garrison contained the southern advance of the Portuguese. French settlers tried but failed to settle the area, with the exception of Villa Occidental. After the Paraguayan War of 1864-1870, U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes arbitrated a boundary dispute between Argentina and Paraguay and ultimately awarded the territory to Paraguay in 1878. In gratitude, Paraguay renamed the department as \\"Presidente Hayes\\" and the capital as \\"Villa Hayes\\". In 1906, during the political division of Paraguay, the department was divided into two regions, Oriental and Occidental. The latter was divided in military headquarters that depended on the War and Marine Ministry. Important dates for this department include June 12 (Chaco Peace Day), September 29 (Boquer√≥n Victory Day) and November 12 (Laudo Hayes Firm Day). Geography  Borders  Located between parallels 22¬∞ 03‚Ä≤ and 25¬∞ 20‚Ä≤ of South latitude and the meridians 57¬∞ 15‚Ä≤ and 61¬∞ 00‚Ä≤ of longitude West. * To the North: Alto Paraguay department, from which is separated by the road of the railway from \\"km 160\\" to \\"km 20\\", from this point by an imaginary straight line until Paraguay River. * To the South: Formosa Province, Argentina, from which is separated by the Pilcomayo River, all the way from its flow into the Paraguay River to the San Lorenzo Mission. * To the East: the departments Concepci√≥n, San Pedro, Cordillera and Central; Presidente Hayes is separated from them by the Paraguay River, from its flow into the La Paz River until the Pilcomayo River. * To the West: Boquer√≥n department, separated by the road that connects the San Lorenzo Mission with the Forts Gral. D√≠az, Avalos S√°nchez, Zenteno, Dr. Gaspar Rodr√≠guez de Francia, Boquer√≥n, Isla Po√≠ and Casanillo, and from this point with an imaginary straight line until \\"km 160\\". Monumento de Benjam√≠n Aceval  Climate  The temperature reaches 44 ¬∞C in summer and drops to 0 ¬∞C in winter, the average temperature is 26 ¬∞C. The average amount of precipitation is between 900 and 1,200 millimeters annually.  Hydrography  The Paraguay River forms one border of the department. The tributary rivers Pilcomayo, San Carlos, Siete Puntas, Negro, Verde, Montelindo, Aguaray Guaz√∫, and Confuso also flow through the department but are not navigable for big ships. To the south lies the Pati√±o Swamp. The city of Villa Hayes floods frequently when the rivers overflow. The land elsewhere in the department is higher. View from Villa Hayes of a ship sailing on the Paraguay River  Environment  There are four ecosystems in the Chaco territory: the floodplain of the Paraguay River, Pozo Azul, Laguna Salada, and the Floodplain of the Pilcomayo River. The Pilcomayo River's deviation towards Argentina has produced several changes in the habits of the people; the drought causes the migration of the jacar√©s to most humid areas and spreads diseases. Endangered flora include timb√≥, samu'u, white and red quebracho, and karanday and endangered fauna include carpincho, jurumi, jacar√©, and tapir. The east has saline soil and the south has calcareous soil. The hills Confuso, Siete Cabezas and Galv√°n are small elevations.  Economy  Industry and business Presidente Hayes leads Paraguay in production of cattle, and is second in production of horses. The population is heavily involved in agriculture; the department is third place in production of sorghum. Cotton and sugarcane are also agricultural products of the area; Villa Hayes and Benjam√≠n Aceval are notable for production of sugarcane. In Villa Hayes are the sugar factory Censi and Pirota. Sawmills, ceramic factories and steel mills are also in the city. ACEPAR, Aceros del Paraguay, is an important iron and steel industry and is also located in Villa Hayes. In addition, in Villa Hayes is Astillero Chaco Paraguayo S.A., a specialising in the construction of launches for heavy loads, fuel and vegetable oil transportation. There is also soap and lime factories and an ESSO plant of fuel and lubricants. Puerto Falc√≥n trades heavily with Argentina and also sees a lot of tourism. Tinfunqu√© National Park is a major tourist attraction with an area of 280,000 hectares. The church of Villa Hayes  Transportation and services  The most important way of transportation is Route No. 9 \\"Carlos Antonio L√≥pez\\" also known as \\"Transchaco\\", which cross the Paraguay River through the Remanso Bridge and extends to Bolivia. The Route No. 12 \\"Vice Presidente S√°nchez\\" borders Pilcomayo River, but is not passable when raining. The road Pozo Colorado-Puerto Milirar reaches Concepci√≥n, crossing the Paraguay River through a bridge. The different roads that connect portions of the department have the inconvenience of being impassable during the rainy season. Paraguay River is the most used way to communicate with Puerto Pinasco. In Puerto Falc√≥n, is possible the communication with the Argentine city Clorinda through the San Ignacio de Loyola International Bridge. The cattle establishments use aerial ways. There are two FM radio stations, Radio Villa Hayes and Dyon. About 3,200 people count with phone service. There are 16,865 households in the department, 6,165 in the urban area, and 10,700 in the rural area. The percentage of which count with basic facilities are the following: * Electric power: 39.9% * Running water: 19.1% * Trash collection: 4.3%  Health and education  The region has 96 institutions of elementary education, 192 of basic education and 29 of high school education. There are 38 hospitals and health care centers.  See also  * List of high schools in Presidente Hayes * Paraguayan War * Rutherford B.

He was named FIFA's \\"Best Referee of the Year\\" six consecutive times and is widely considered to be the greatest football referee of all time.IFFHS: \\"All-Time World Referee Ranking\\" . Iffhs.de. Retrieved on 16 July 2015. Collina is still involved in football, as an unpaid consultant to the Italian Football Referees Association (AIA), as the Head of Referees for the Football Federation of Ukraine since 2010,Ukraine trying to revive Crimean champion football club, USA Today (19 June 2015) as a member of the UEFA Referees Committee, and as Chairman of the FIFA referees committee. Refereeing career Collina was born in Bologna and attended the University of Bologna, graduating with a degree in economics in 1984. During his teenage years, he played as a central defender for a local team, but was persuaded in 1977 to take a referee's course, where it was discovered that he had a particular aptitude for the job. Within three years he was officiating at the highest level of regional matches, while also completing his compulsory military service. In 1988, he progressed more rapidly than normal to the national third division, Serie C1 and Serie C2. After three seasons, he was promoted to officiating Serie B and Serie A matches. About this time, Collina contracted a severe form of alopecia, resulting in the permanent loss of all his facial hair, giving him his distinctive bald appearance and earning the nickname Kojak. In 1995, after he had officiated at 43 Serie A matches, he was placed on FIFA's Referees List. He was allocated five matches at the 1996 Olympic Games, including the final between Nigeria and Argentina. He refereed the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final between Bayern Munich and Manchester United; he cited this as his most memorable game because of the cheers at the end, which he described as a \\"lions' roar\\".Referee profile mentioning the \\"lion's roar\\", 1999: the Euro 2004 section of the 7M.CN website. In June 2002, Collina reached the pinnacle of his career, when he was chosen for the World Cup final, between Brazil and Germany. Prior to the game, Germany's Oliver Kahn told the Irish Times: \\"Collina is a world-class referee, there's no doubt about that, but he doesn't bring luck, does he?\\" Kahn was referring to two previous high-profile matches that Collina had refereed which involved Kahn: the aforementioned 1999 UEFA Champions League Final, a 2‚Äì1 defeat for Bayern; and Germany's 5‚Äì1 defeat against England in September 2001.World Cup 2002 News: Ireland.com (The Irish Times) (1 July 2002). Retrieved on 29 May 2007. Kahn's luck did not change in the final, and his team lost 2‚Äì0. He refereed the 2004 UEFA Cup Final between Valencia and Marseille. In February 2005, as he reached the mandatory retirement age, UEFA Euro 2004 was his last major international tournament. His last international match was Portugal ‚Äì Slovakia, for a 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifier at Est√°dio da Luz in Lisbon. The FIGC raised its mandatory retirement age to 46 in order to accommodate Collina for a further season. However, a dispute emerged between the federation and Collina early in August 2005, following his decision to sign a sponsorship deal with Opel (also advertising for Vauxhall Motors in the United Kingdom ‚Äì both are owned by General Motors). As Opel was also a sponsor of Serie A club A.C. Milan, the deal was seen as a conflict of interest, and Collina was not allowed to referee top flight matches in Italy. In response, Collina handed in his resignation, effectively ending his career. The Italian Referees Association then attempted to reject his resignation, but he persisted with his retirement. He did, however, referee the Soccer Aid matches for charity in May 2006 and September 2008. During the latter of these games, Collina was involved in an awkward fall and was stretchered off after 21 minutes of play. He also refereed the first half of the 2010 Soccer Aid match on 6 June. Collina's final competitive game was a Champions League qualifier between Everton and Villarreal on 24 August 2005. He announced his retirement soon after the game. Collina attracted the ire of Luciano Moggi, the Juventus executive and chief instigator of the 2006 Italian football scandal. Collina was one of the referees that Moggi attempted to have punished for decisions that were made against Juventus. In an intercepted phone call, Moggi claimed that Collina and his colleague Roberto Rosetti were too \\"objective\\" and should be \\"punished\\" for it.Roberto Rosetti. Worldreferee.com. Retrieved on 4 December 2011. As a result, he and Rosetti were two of the few referees that emerged unscathed from the scandal. In September 2005, his easily recognisable face (to followers of football) also led to his appearance in an advert for the Vauxhall Vectra, which aired during the 2006 World Cup in the United Kingdom. He also appeared in adverts, for MasterCard and Adidas during the 2006 World Cup. Although Collina is closely identified with football, his favourite sports club plays basketball. He is a lifelong supporter of Fortitudo Bologna, one of Europe's leading basketball clubs. On 25 January 2010, Collina participated in a special match for supporting victims of the earthquake in Haiti opposing \\"Friends of Zidane and Ronaldo\\" and the Benfica team in Lisbon. Collina has been head of referees for the Football Federation of Ukraine since 2010. His work in this position is criticised by national referees who disapprove of his lack of involvement in Ukrainian football (spending not more than two weeks per year in Ukraine) and possible tolerance towards corruption in the Ukrainian national football association.http://www.matchday.ua/blog/uvaga-uvaga/kollina-prikrivaye- korupciyu-svoyim-imenem-spovid-arbitra-249/ Personal life In 1988, Collina met his future wife Gianna in Versilia. After living together almost from their meeting, they moved to the coastal town of Viareggio. Since the wedding, the couple have had two daughters. In 2003, Collina published his autobiography, My Rules of the Game (Le Mie Regole del Gioco). In August 2005, after his retirement, he concentrated on his own business, as a financial advisor. Today he lives in Forte dei Marmi. Since he was the main referee of the Second Round match between Japan and Turkey at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, he became famous in Japan, and appeared in a television advert for frozen takoyaki products. He is also very popular in Turkey, as no Turkish team, national or club, lost a game with him in charge. ADWIN Communication & Marketing website (Japanese) retrieved 19 December 2009 In July 2002, he appeared in cartoon form in George Michael's video \\"Shoot the Dog\\". Collina was chosen as the cover figure for the Konami video games Pro Evolution Soccer 3 and Pro Evolution Soccer 4, appearing alongside compatriot Francesco Totti and Thierry Henry for the latter. This was unusual, as football games had come to almost exclusively feature only players and managers on their covers, and he did not feature in either game. In addition, he featured as an \\"unlockable\\" referee in the rival EA Sports game FIFA Football 2005, released shortly before Pro Evolution Soccer 4. In September 2005, Collina appeared in a television advert for the Vauxhall Vectra. In 2006, Collina appeared in another television advert, this time for MB Pivo, a beer brand in Serbia. He also appeared in an advert of a Turkish GSM operator, Aria, due to his popularity in Turkey.

The capital is the city of San Pedro de Ycuamandiy√∫.  History  During the 17th and 18th centuries there was even greater political and population instability than in Concepci√≥n. The Mbay√° and Payagua native tribes threatened all the area between the Ypan√© (in the north) and Manduvir√° (in the south) Rivers and the valley by the Jeju√≠ River. In 1660 the natives revolted in Arecaj√° against the postal parcel system, causing the disappearance of this town. To help regenerate this area, the Missions San Estanislao (1749), Villa del Rosario (1786) and San Pedro de Ycuamandiy√∫ (1786) were founded. The second department of the country, San Pedro, was created by law in 1906, and included the territories of Itacurub√≠ del Rosario, Santa Rosa del Aguaray, Tacuat√≠, Uni√≥n, Ygatimi and Curuguaty, as well as the area of Canindey√∫. Its limits were defined finally in 1973. In 1941, the Bruderhof, an Anabaptist group fleeing Nazi persecution, settled in the area of Rosario. They lived here for over 20 years, founding a hospital. They left for North America in 1966.

Its limits are: * To the North: the Ypan√© River, which separates San Pedro from Concepci√≥n. * To the South: the Manduvir√° River and Hondo Stream, which separates it from Cordillera; also the San Joaqu√≠n Cordillera, which separates it from Caaguaz√∫. * To the East: the Aguaray River, the limit with Amambay, and the rivers Jeju√≠ Guaz√∫, Curuguaty and Corrientes, which separates San Pedro from Canindey√∫. * To the West: the Paraguay River, natural limit with Presidente Hayes. It is the biggest department of the Oriental Region, and is mostly dedicated to agriculture, cattle and forestry.  Districts  The department is divided in 20 districts: # Antequera # Capiibary # Chor√© # General Aquino # General Resqu√≠n # Guayaib√≠ # Itacurub√≠ del Rosario # Lima # Nueva Germania # San Estanislao # San Pablo # San Pedro # Santa Rosa # Tacuat√≠ # Uni√≥n # 25 de Diciembre # Villa del Rosario # Yataity # Yrybucu√° # Liberaci√≥n  Climate  The climate is humid and rainy. The average temperature is 23 ¬∞C, the minimum in winter is 10 ¬∞C and the maximum in summer is 38 ¬∞C. The humidity is 70 to 80%, and the precipitation can reach 1,324 mm.  Orography and soil  The soil in San Pedro is sedimentary in the north, and with swamps, lagoons and valleys in the south. In the San Joaqu√≠n Mountains, natural limit with Caaguaz√∫, the hills: Curuz√∫, Coraz√≥n, Aguaray, Noviret√°, Guaviray and San Miguel outstand among others. The hill Cerro Dos de Oro, in Capiibary, is also an important landmark Half the territory of the department is apt for agriculture and cattle.  Hydrography  Yhaguy river The west side of the territory is nurtured by the Paraguay River. The rivers: Ypan√©, Jeju√≠ Guaz√∫, Aguaraymi, Aguaray Guaz√∫, Maduvir√° and Tacuat√≠ cross the entire department. The Corrientes River is by the east of the department. In San Pedro the swamps are abundant: Piripuc√∫, San Antonio, Yetyty, Tapiracuai, Peguah√≥, Mbutuy, Tobatiry and Aguaraymi. There are also the lagoons Vera and Blanca. The most important ports are: Milagro, Colorado, Santa Rosa, Tacur√∫ Pyt√°, Uno, Laurel, Jeju√≠, Mbopicu√°, Santa Elena and Uruguait√°.  Nature and Vegetation  This territory is located between two ecosystems: the Central Forest and the Central Littoral. Due to deforestation, the primary resource of the department, which is the forestall resource, is nowadays the most affected, all as a result of the human activity. Some plant species are in danger of extinction, such as: yvyra paje, cedar, nandyta, victoria cruziana. And among the animal species: the tucan guaz√∫ (big toucan), guazut√≠, jacar√© overo, mboi jagua and lobop√©. The protected areas are: part of the San Joaqu√≠n Mountains, Blanca Lagoon, and the Milagros and Puerto Rosario Swamps.  Economy  The most important economic activity is cattle farming, and a moderate exploit of agriculture and almost no industry. The region's most important products are: cotton, soy, sugar cane, tobacco, beans, corn, banana, wheat, manioc, sour and sweet oranges. It is considered the number one tobacco, orange and grapefruit producer in the country, and the second best in production of sugar cane. There is also cultivation of sorghum, tangerine, garlic and potatoes. San Pedro is the second best department in cattle and the first in production of poultry, such as turkey, goose and guinea fowl. The industries are: the cotton gin industry, yerba mills and distilleries of petit grain. In less proportion there are also sawmills and food industries such as coconut oil and starch producers. The sawmills have an important volume of production of different kinds of woods.  Communication and Services  A cart in Veinticinco de Diciembre San Pedro department San Pedro has well paved roads that travel through the department, link all the districts, and join to national routes ‚ÄúGral Elizardo Aquino‚Äù (Route 3), ‚ÄúDr. Blas Garay‚Äù (Route 8), ‚ÄúLas Residentas‚Äù (Route 10) and ‚ÄúJuana de Lara‚Äù (Route 11).

Biography Oliver is the first son of Rick Wakeman. His parents divorced when he was young. Solo He worked with Clive Nolan (of Arena) on two progressive rock concept albums, Jabberwocky (released 1999) and Hound of the Baskervilles. Tracy Hitchings appears on both albums, while Rick Wakeman (narrating) and Yes alumnus Peter Banks both appeared on Jabberwocky. Wakeman worked with Steve Howe for several years, (originally his father's bandmate in Yes and later as a bandmate when Oliver joined Yes himself). The two lived fairly close to each other in south-west England. Howe guested on Wakeman's solo album The 3 Ages of Magick, while Wakeman is on Howe's 2005 solo album Spectrum and contributed to Howe's recording of \\"Australia\\" for the US version of the Yes collection The Ultimate Yes: 35th Anniversary Collection. Wakeman wrote a CD inspired by his visits to and experiences on Lundy, a small island in the Bristol Channel which was released originally in 1997 and then again in 1999. He toured with Bob Catley in the UK and Europe and also guested on an Ayreon project The Human Equation in 2004. Wakeman replaced keyboardist Herb Schildt for the American progressive rock band Starcastle, known for their Yes-like sound, at RoSfest (Rites of Spring festival) 2007. During 2006 and 2007 Oliver took to the road with his band performing selections from his Mother's Ruin album as well as songs from his back catalogue. In late 2007 this show was filmed and recorded in Poland and subsequently released in 2008 as a CD/DVD package and single DVD titled Coming To Town. A single CD release appeared in 2009. Oliver has been nominated for the Classic Rock Society's 'Best Keyboard Player' award on many occasions and has won the award three times (2006, 2007 & 2008). He spent 2012 working with Gordon Giltrap on a new recording project titled Ravens & Lullabies which was released in 2013.Oliver Wakeman Website, news item from 28 January 2012. They toured together throughout September and October 2012 in preparation for the album's release. The tour continued throughout 2013, including a full band headline show at the Summer's End festival. Oliver & Gordon also appeared with singer Paul Manzi on Bob Harris' BBC Radio 2 show in June 2013. Oliver's The 3 Ages of Magick was re-released in 2013 with bonus material and an expanded booklet. Yes In 2008, the official Yes website announced that Oliver Wakeman would tour with Yes in the band's 40th anniversary tour. However, the tour was postponed due to the illness of Yes singer Jon Anderson. A revamped In the Present Tour featuring Steve Howe, Chris Squire and Alan White of Yes plus Oliver Wakeman and Canadian singer Beno√Æt David (filling in for Anderson) began in the fall of 2008, and continued into 2009. The second leg of the tour was cancelled after one date when Squire had to have an urgent leg operation on 11 February.YesWorld: In the Present Tour Wakeman after a show with Yes in Brazil, November 2010. The band returned to touring in summer 2009 and this continued through to summer 2010. They also signed to Frontiers Records, an Italian record company. Yes started work on an album, with Wakeman, in October/November 2010 followed by a tour of South America in November/December of that year. Though he worked with the band on the initial sessions for their first album in 10 years, Fly from Here, he was dismissed from Yes during recording. Wakeman stayed on for the Rite of Spring tour (March to early April 2011) and formally left following its completion. Asia and Drama era Yes keyboardist Geoff Downes, who replaced Wakeman for the rest of the album's sessions, was later announced as keyboardist for its upcoming summer tour. Some of Wakeman's contributions to Fly from Here nevertheless made it onto the released version of the album, and he was even credited as having co-written one track. He also appears on the Yes CD and DVD release In the Present ‚Äì Live from Lyon playing all of the keyboards. Oliver also appears in the documentary film which accompanies this release. In 2019, material Wakeman wrote and recorded with Yes was released as From a Page. Starcastle Oliver joined Starcastle for their April 2007 headlining performance at the Rites of Spring festival (ROSfest), an annual progressive rock festival in Pennsylvania. Strawbs In 2009, Wakeman joined Strawbs (another of his father's former bands) for their tours of Canada, the UK and Italy during 2009 and 2010. He recorded an album with the band, Dancing to the Devil's Beat which was released in 2009. In 2010 he appeared on the Strawbs 40th anniversary live double CD, Strawberry Fayre. Wakeman was not with the band for their late 2010 tour given his prior commitment to recording with Yes.

UKeU delivered courses over a learning environment developed by Sun Microsystems UK. It was set up with UK public funds under the auspices of the Higher Education Funding Council for England. It operated between 2000 and 2004 and was subsequently wound down having failed to deliver its targets.  Brief history  The UKeU was first proposed as a concept by David Blunkett, then Secretary of State for Education for the UK, in a speech in February 2000, as a vehicle to deliver the best of UK higher education in online fashion across the world. The Secretary of State instructed the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) to take the lead in putting this into practice. Many universities already offered their own online courses. The Scottish universities were not part of the UKeU. The idea behind the UKeU was that it would be a broker, an agent marketing online degrees and providing a technological platform to facilitate expansion. By late summer 2000, the key initial studies on business model, tools and markets had already been done and a shadow body, the e-University Steering Group had been established. By May 2001 many follow-up studies had been done and the operating company UK eUniversities Worldwide Limited had been incorporated; by summer 2001 an Interim Management Team had been appointed; and by October 2001 the Strategic Agreement had been signed by Sun Microsystems. By March 2002 a new chairman and CEO were in post and the Framework Agreement had been signed with Sun to commence development of the e-learning platform. Much of the cost of the UKeU was absorbed by the development of the technical platform and it was suggested that existing web- based learning platforms could have been used or adapted for use at a fraction of the cost. Sun Microsystems contributed \\"¬£3.5 million of professional services and hardware\\" rather than cash. The UkeU did not award its own degrees, instead contracting with universities to offer theirs. The company focused on infrastructure development, course development support, quality assurance, and marketing. The target audiences were primarily international graduate students who wished to study online rather than come to the UK By March 2003 two courses had been launched, from the Open University and Sheffield Hallam University, with many further courses following in autumn 2003 making a total of 15. By January 2004 some 25 courses were recruiting students. The first Annual Report of UKeU is no longer easy to find but there is a detailed analysis of it by OBHE still available at http://www.obhe.ac.uk/documents/2003/Articles/UK_eUniversity_annual_report_2002_03_what_more_does_it_tell_us_ Cancellation It became clear however, that HEFCE had been unhappy for some months, especially with the low student numbers and the lack of private finance, and had commissioned PA Consulting to carry out a Business Review of UKeU. PA reported finally to HEFCE in January 2004 and in late February 2004 HEFCE announced to the UKeU Board and to the world that they would \\"restructure\\" UKeU. Although it was not announced as such at the time, this restructuring led to a rapid decline in funds and confidence and UKeU closed as an operating entity in summer 2004. It was regarded as a failure having cost ¬£50 m and recruited only 900 students. These received some of the most expensive degrees in history at ¬£56,000 each. A highly critical [report https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmeduski/205/20502.htm] by the UK House of Commons Select committee on Education and Skills was published in March 2005. In an accompanying press release, Committee chairman, Barry Sheerman said: \\"UKeU was a terrible waste of public money. The senior executives failed to interest any private investors and showed an extraordinary over confidence in their ability to attract students to the scheme. Any private company which rewards underperformance of this scale would normally face severe criticism from its shareholders.\\" The ¬£2m-plus wage bill for 2002 to 2003 included chief executive John Beaumont's ¬£180,000 salary and performance-related bonus of ¬£44,914. UKeU's executive directors received ¬£100,000 in total bonuses during 2002/2003. HEFCE identified marketing, and inadequate market research in particular, as the key cause of the failure of UKeU. Based on an assumption that there was a huge unmet demand for internet based e-learning, too much trust was put on the PwC forecast of student numbers and the general atmosphere of enthusiasm surrounding the 'dot com boom' . UKeU did not undertake any market research despite spending ¬£4.2 million on sales and marketing. There was confusion in the branding and unique selling points of the online offerings. Mainstream UK higher education at the time relied heavily on emphasising the three elements of tradition, place, and quality. Marketing by UKeU that promised \\"the best of U.K. higher education with online convenience\\". The overall concept of a \\"UK e-University\\" lasted 4¬Ω years, while the company in its operational phase lasted just over two. Even by the standards of e-learning burn-outs, this was fast. Unlike in many cases in the public or quasi-public sector such as TechBC or Scottish Knowledge, there was no organisation that followed on from UKeU, even in a general sense. However, a number of small components of UKeU continued more or less unchanged as spin-offs, including the eChina Programme and the e-Learning Research Centre.

The book contains five previously published essays, many of which were significantly altered by Strauss from their original publication. The general theme of the book is the relationship between politics and philosophy. The thesis of the book is that many ancient and early modern political philosophers, in order to avoid persecution, hid their most heterodox ideas within their texts. Overview Strauss's general argument‚Äîrearticulated throughout his subsequent writings (most notably in The City and Man ‚Äì 1964)‚Äîis that prior to the 19th century, Western scholars commonly understood that philosophical writing is not at home in any polity, no matter how liberal. Insofar as it questions conventional wisdom at its roots, philosophy must guard itself especially against those readers who believe themselves authoritative, wise, and liberal defenders of the status quo. In questioning established opinions, or in investigating the principles of morality, philosophers of old found it necessary to convey their messages in an oblique manner. Their \\"art of writing\\" was the art of esoteric communication. This is all the more apparent in medieval times, when heterodox political thinkers wrote under the threat of the Inquisition or comparably intransigent tribunals. Strauss's argument is not that the medieval writers he studies reserved one exoteric meaning for the many (hoi polloi) and an esoteric or hidden one for the few (hoi aristoi, literally \\"the best\\") but rather that their writings' respective core meanings extended beyond and were irreducible to their texts' literal and/or historical dimension. Explicitly following Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's lead, Strauss indicates that medieval political philosophers, no less than their ancient counterparts, in writing, carefully adapted their wording to the dominant moral views of their time, lest their writings be condemned as heretical or unjust, not by \\"the many\\" (who did not read), but by those \\"few\\" whom the many regarded as the most righteous guardians of morality: precisely those few righteous personalities would be most inclined to persecute or ostracize anyone who is in the business of exposing the \\"noble\\" or \\"great lie\\" upon which stands or falls the authority of the few over the many. Strauss thus presents Maimonides \\"as a closet nonbeliever obfuscating his message for political reasons.\\"Michael Paley and Jacob J.

They are known for their hardiness and quiet temperament. The New Zealand government strictly controls the population to protect the habitat in which they live, which includes several endangered species of plants. The varying heritage gives the breed a wide range of heights, body patterns and colours. They are usually well-muscled, sure-footed and tough. Horses were first reported in the Kaimanawa Range in 1876, although the first horses had been brought into New Zealand in 1814. The feral herds grew as horses escaped and were released from sheep stations and cavalry bases. Members of the herd were recaptured by locals for use as riding horses, as well as being caught for their meat, hair and hides. The herd declined as large scale farming and forestry operations encroached on their ranges, and only around 174 horses were known to exist by 1979. The Kaimanawa herd was protected by the New Zealand government in 1981, and there were 1,576 horses in the herd by 1994. A small, mostly unmanaged population also exists on the Aupouri Peninsula at the northern tip of the North Island. Roundups have been carried out annually since 1993 to manage the size of the herd, removing around 2,800 horses altogether. The Kaimanawa population is listed as a herd of special genetic value by the United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organization, and several studies have been conducted on the herd dynamics and habits of the breed. History The first horses were introduced to New Zealand by Protestant missionary Reverend Samuel Marsden in December 1814, and wild horses were first reported in the Kaimanawa Range in central North Island of New Zealand in 1876. The Kaimanawa breed descended from domestic horses that were released in the late 19th century and early 20th century in the middle of the North Island around the Kaimanawa mountains. Between 1858 and 1875, Major George Gwavas Carlyon imported Exmoor ponies to Hawkes Bay (thought unlikely to be purebred Exmoor's). They were then later crossed with local stock to produce the Carlyon pony. These Carlyon ponies were later crossed with two Welsh stallions, Kinarth Caesar and Comet, imported by Sir Donald McLean, and a breed known as the Comet resulted. At some point during the 1870s, McLean released a Comet stallion and several mares on the Kaingaroa Plains and the bloodline apparently became part of the wild Kaimanawa population. Other horses were added to the bloodline through escapes and releases from local sheep stations and from cavalry units at Waiouru that were threatened with a strangles epidemic. It is also thought that in the 1960s Nicholas Koreneff released an Arabian stallion into the Argo Valley region. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, horses were harvested from the feral herds and used as riding and stock horses, as well as being used for their meat, hair and hides. Originally there were many herds that roamed land owned by the British Crown and the native MƒÅori, but many were eradicated with the intensification of large scale farming and forestry operations combined with increased mechanization that decreased the need for stock horses. Kaimanawa horses today have the highest amount of genetic similarity with the Thoroughbred and other Thoroughbred cross breeds. Pressure from land development and an encroaching human population reduced the range and the number of the Kaimanawa horses, and in 1979 it was found that only about 174 horses remained. Starting in 1981, the Kaimanawa population, range size, and herd movements began to be officially measured, and a protected area was formed for the breed in the Waiouru Military Training Area. Legislative protection was similar to the kiwi and other native species. There was a rapid increase in the herd size following the protection of the breed, and 1,576 horses were known to exist in the area by 1994. There is also a small population of horses on the Aupouri Peninsula at the northern tip of the North Island, which is mostly unmanaged by the New Zealand government. In 2008, the Kaimanawa herds were the focus of a novel called Kaimanawa Princess, by Dianne Haworth. Breed characteristics Many characteristics of the Comet type are said to be shown in the Kaimanawa horses today, although the varied gene input has produced a wide range of sizes, colours, and body types among the wild horses. The Kaimanawa breed varies widely in general appearance, with heights ranging between high. Any coat colour or pattern marking is acceptable. They are usually well-muscled. Their feral way of life has given them the ability to adapt quickly and live on very little, and they are usually sure-footed and tough. They have a medium-sized head in good proportion to their body, with wide variation in shape due to the different conformation of their ancestors. Kaimanawa horses have a short, deep neck with a thick throat area, straight shoulders, a deep girth, and a short to medium back. The hindquarters vary from sloping to well-rounded. The legs are long and well-muscled, with strong hooves, and hind hooves that are generally smaller than the front ones. All horses are considered to age a year on the first of August, regardless of their actual foaling date. Population control and study Owing to the increase in population after protective legislation was put into place, the Department of Conservation developed a management plan for the Kaimanawa herd in 1989 and 1990. A draft plan was made available to the public for comment in 1991, and the public made it clear that it objected to herd reduction through shooting from helicopters, and instead favoured the horses remaining alive after being removed from the herd. However, core animal welfare groups felt that shooting was the most humane option. Trial musters were conducted in 1993, 1994 and 1995, and were successful, although costly and with a limited demand for the captured horses. In 1994, a working party was established to look at the management of the Kaimanawa herd. They aimed to decide which organization was in charge of long term management, to ensure that the treatment of horses is humane, to preserve and control the best attributes of the herds, and to eliminate the impacts of the herds on other conservation priorities. Goals included ensuring the welfare of the horses, protecting natural ecosystems and features that the Kaimanawa herd may impact and keeping the herd at a sustainable level. Ecological objectives included ensuring that Kaimanawa horse does not adversely affect endangered, rare and biogeographically significant plants; ensuring that the herd does not further degrade the ecosystems in which it lives; and preventing the herd from spreading into the Kaimanawa Forest Park and the Tongariro National Park. Herd objectives included ensuring that the public was safe from roaming horses, while still allowing and improving public access to the herd and ensuring humane treatment of the horses; reducing conflict between the herd and other ecological values and land uses; and ensuring that the herd is contained to a population that is tolerated by the ecosystems in which they live while still maintaining a minimum effective population that is in general free ranging. The Department of Conservation has since 1993 carried out annual culls and muster of Kaimanawas to keep the herd population around a target level of 500 horses. The target will be reduced to 300 horses in stages starting in 2009. These horses are either taken directly to slaughter or are placed at holding farms for later slaughter or adoption by private homes. A main reason for the strict population control is to protect the habitat in which they live. This habitat includes 16 plant species listed as endangered, which the Kaimanawa may endanger further through trampling and overgrazing. These plants include herbs, grasses, sedges, flowers and mistletoes; among these are Deschampsia caespitosa (a very rare tussock grass), Peraxilla tetrapetala (a vulnerable mistletoe) and Libertia peregrinans (a possibly locally extinct sand iris). The 2009 culling of the population removed 230 horses from the herd, the largest culling since the beginning of the program, with homes found for 85% of the horses removed. Conservation of these horses is an important matter to the public, and between 1990 and 2003 the New Zealand Minister for Conservation received more public comments on the Kaimanawa horse than on any other subject. In this period, more than 1,400 requests for information and letters were received, with public interest peaking in 1996 and 1997. This was due to a program of population reduction by shooting scheduled to begin implementation in 1996; due to public opposition the shooting was cancelled and a large scale muster and adoption program began in 1997. In 1997, around 1,069 horses were removed from the range and adopted, reducing the main herd to around 500, and reducing their range to around 25,000 ha from around 70,000. Since 1993, a total of around 2,800 horses have been removed from the range. Only one injury resulting in the death of a horse is known to have occurred. The United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organization lists the Kaimanawa horses as a herd of special genetic value that can be compared with other groups of feral horses such as New Forest ponies, Assateague ponies, wild Mustangs, and with free-living zebras. Kaimanawas are of special value because of their low rate of interaction with humans. This lack of interaction may result in a herd with more wild and fewer domestic characteristics, which is of special interest to researchers. Between 1994 and 1997, students from Massey University studied a population of around 400 Kaimanawa horses to learn their habits and herd dynamics. A 2000 study found that although sometimes there are more than two stallions in Kaimanawa horse herds, only the two stallions highest in the herd hierarchy mate with the herd females. This differs from other feral horse herds, some of which have only one stallion that mates with mares, while others have several stallions that sire foals.

The Royal Hospital Chelsea is home to 300 retired British soldiers, male and female (the latter since 2009), and is located on Royal Hospital Road. Historically, the term \\"Chelsea Pensioner\\" applied more widely, referring to both In-Pensioners and Out-Pensioners who live elsewhere. In- and Out-Pensioners Sergeant William Hiseland, an English Civil War cavalier and one of the first pensioners to be admitted to the Royal Hospital in London The Royal Hospital was founded by King Charles II in 1682 as a retreat for veterans.Guidebook, p. 3 The provision of a hostel rather than the payment of pensions was inspired by Les Invalides in Paris. During the reign of King William III and Queen Mary II, the Royal Hospital was still under construction so they introduced a system for distribution of army pensions in 1689. The pension was to be made available to all former soldiers who had been injured in service, or who had served for more than 20 years. By the time the Royal Hospital was completed, there were more pensioners than places available in the Royal Hospital. Eligible ex-soldiers who could not be housed in the Hospital were termed Out- Pensioners, receiving their pension from the Royal Hospital but living outside it. In-Pensioners, by contrast, surrender their army pension and live within the Royal Hospital. A number of veterans were incorporated into the Corps of Invalids from 1688 to 1802, receiving the equivalent of the out-pension in exchange for performing garrison duty. In 1703 there were 51 Out-Pensioners. By 1815 this had risen to 36,757. The Royal Hospital remained responsible for distributing army pensions until 1955, following which the phrase \\"Out- Pensioner\\" became less common, and \\"Chelsea Pensioner\\" was used largely to refer to \\"In-Pensioners\\". Conditions for admission as an In-Pensioner To be eligible for admission as a Chelsea Pensioner a candidate must be a former soldier or non-commissioned officer of the British Army (including National Service) or a former officer of the British Army who served in the ranks for at least 12 years or was awarded a disablement pension while serving in the ranks. They must be over 65 years of age, be able to live independently on the Long Wards on arrival to the Royal Hospital Chelsea and be free of any financial obligation to support a spouse or family. Life of In-Pensioners A ward within the Royal Hospital Chelsea Applicants for the Royal Hospital Chelsea (RHC) are invited for a four-day stay during which they get a taste of what life is like for a Chelsea Pensioner. If they enjoy their stay and it is felt that they will fit in they are invited to become a Chelsea Pensioner. Upon arrival at the Royal Hospital, each In-Pensioner is measured up for their Blues (day-to-day uniform) and Scarlets (the famous uniform that they wear on parade). They are given their own room, or \\"berth\\" in a ward, and are allocated to a Company. Up until refurbishment works carried out in the 1950s, these rooms measured 6 x 6 feet. Work completed in 2015 has ensured that all In-Pensioner berths include en suite facilities, a writing desk, and natural light. On entry, In-Pensioners surrender their army pension, in return receiving board, lodging, clothing and full medical care. In-Pensioners also have their own club with a bar, lounges and restaurant; there are allotments for those who enjoy gardening and facilities for lawn bowls. If an In- Pensioner becomes unwell they are moved into the Infirmary, which is a care home with nursing and a G.P. medical centre. The Royal Hospital Burial Ground is at Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey. Admission of women Marjorie Cole, middle, one of many female Chelsea Pensioners at the Royal Hospital Until 2009, only male candidates were admitted. It was announced in 2007 that female ex-service personnel would be admitted on the completion of modernisation of the long wards.Women to join Chelsea pensioners BBC News 26 February 2007 In March 2009 the first women in the Hospital‚Äôs 317-year history were admitted as In-Pensioners: Dorothy Hughes (aged 85) and Winifred Phillips (aged 82). In- Pensioner Dorothy Hughes in 2013 Winifred Phillips (1926‚Äì2016) trained as a nurse and joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service in 1948 and enlisted in the Women's Royal Army Corps in 1949 while serving in Egypt. For the next 22 years she served in Singapore, Cyprus and Egypt reaching the rank of Warrant Officer Class 2. She wrote two books about becoming one of the first female Chelsea Pensioners: My Journey to Becoming the First Lady Chelsea Pensioner (2010), and Mum‚Äôs Army: Love and Adventure from the NAAFI to Civvy Street (2013).

In 1945 the Battery was deployed near Dover to defend against V-1 flying bomb attacks. She later worked with the Army Operational Research Group developing fuses in shells used against V-2 rockets and was discharged from the Army in 1946 with the rank of Sergeant.‚ÄòDorothy Hughes and Winifred Phillips become first female Chelsea Pensioners‚Äô The Times‚Äô‚Äô 13 March 2009'Now I feel just like Cinderella at the ball' Daily Telegraph‚Äô‚Äô 5 March 2009\\"Women joining Chelsea pensioners, BBC News, 12 March 2009 The records at Royal Hospital show that another woman, Christian Davies, was admitted to Chelsea Hospital circa 1717, and was awarded a pension for her service in the army and the wounds she received in the service of the King. She died in 1739 and was buried in the Royal Hospital Chelsea with full military honours. Clothing A Chelsea Pensioner in scarlet uniform. Chelsea Pensioners are entitled to come and go from the Royal Hospital as they please, and are permitted to wear civilian clothing wherever they travel. However, within the Hospital, and in the surrounding area, they are encouraged to wear a blue uniform. If they travel further from the Royal Hospital, they should wear the distinctive scarlet coats instead of the blue uniform. The scarlet coats are also worn for ceremonial occasions, accompanied by tricorne hats. At other times a peaked hat, known as a shako, is generally worn. In uniform, the pensioners wear their medal ribbons and the insignia of the rank they reached while serving in the armed forces. They may also wear other insignia they earned during their service and this has included parachute jump wings and SAS jump wings. Men In Scarlet album Seven Chelsea Pensioners at the Royal Hospital Chelsea released an album on 8 November 2010 in order to raise money for the Chelsea Pensioners' Appeal. Featuring Dame Vera Lynn, Katherine Jenkins, The Soldiers and Janey Cutler, the album is full of well known wartime songs and includes their traditional march, \\"The Old Brigade\\". Chelsea Football Club Nearby Chelsea Football Club has been affiliated with the Chelsea Pensioners for many years; the club's first nickname was the Pensioners and until the 1950s the club crest featured a Chelsea pensioner. Residents of the Hospital can be seen attending Chelsea's home games at Stamford Bridge. When Chelsea won the Premier League title in 2005, Chelsea Pensioners formed a guard of honour as the players and management came out for the trophy presentation. This was repeated when Chelsea won the title in 2010. In tribute to the trademark scarlet coats worn by the pensioners, Chelsea's kit for the 2010‚Äì11 season featured a red trim on the collars.

His autobiography was published as a book, The Terminal Man, in 2004. Early life Nasseri was born in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company settlement located in Masjed Soleiman, Iran. His father was an Iranian doctor working for the company. Nasseri stated that his mother was a nurse from Scotland working in the same place. He arrived in the United Kingdom in September 1973, to take a three-year course in Yugoslav studies at the University of Bradford.  Life in Terminal 1  Nasseri's residency site in Terminal 1 of Charles de Gaulle Airport. Nasseri alleges to have been expelled from Iran in 1977 for protests against the Shah and after a long battle, involving applications in several countries, was awarded refugee status by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Belgium. This allegedly permitted residence in many other European countries. However, this claim has been disputed, with investigations showing that Nasseri was never expelled from Iran. Having one British parent, he decided to settle in the UK in 1986, but en route there in 1988, his papers were lost when his briefcase was allegedly stolen (others indicate that Nasseri actually mailed his documents to Brussels while onboard a ferry to Britain, lying about them being stolen). Despite this setback, he boarded the plane for London but was promptly returned to France when he failed to present a passport to British immigration officials. He was initially arrested by the French, but then released as his entry to the airport was legal and he had no country of origin to be returned to; thus began his residency at Terminal 1. His case was later taken on by French human rights lawyer Christian Bourget. In 1992, a French court ruled that, having entered the country legally, he could not be expelled from the airport, but it could not grant him permission to enter France. Attempts were then made to have new documents issued from Belgium, but the authorities there would only do so if Nasseri presented himself in person. In 1995, the Belgian authorities granted permission for him to travel to Belgium, but only if he agreed to live there under supervision of a social worker. Nasseri refused this on the grounds of wanting to enter the UK as originally intended. Both France and Belgium offered Nasseri residency, but Nasseri refused to sign the papers as they listed him as being Iranian (he wanted it to be British) and did not show his preferred name, \\"Sir Alfred Mehran\\". His refusal to sign the documents was much to the frustration of his lawyer, Bourget. When contacted about Nasseri's situation, his family stated that they believed he was living the life he wanted. In 2003, Spielberg's DreamWorks production company paid US$250,000 to Nasseri for the rights to his story, but ultimately did not use his story in the subsequent film, The Terminal. Nasseri's stay at the airport ended in July 2006 when he was hospitalized and his sitting place dismantled. Towards the end of January 2007, he left the hospital and was looked after by the airport's branch of the French Red Cross; he was lodged for a few weeks in a hotel close to the airport. On 6 March 2007, he was transferred to an Emmaus charity reception-centre in Paris's 20th arrondissement. Since 2008, he has continued to live in a Paris shelter. During his 18-year-long stay at Terminal 1 in the Charles de Gaulle Airport, Nasseri had his luggage at his side and spent his time reading, writing in his diary or studying economics. He received food and newspapers from employees of the airport, visits from journalists eager to hear his story and letters of support.  Autobiography  In 2004 Nasseri's autobiography, The Terminal Man, was published. It was co-written by Nasseri with British author Andrew Donkin and was reviewed in The Sunday Times as being \\"profoundly disturbing and brilliant\\".  Documentaries and fictionalizations  Nasseri's story provided the inspiration for the 1994 French film Tomb√©s du ciel, starring Jean Rochefort, internationally released under the title Lost in Transit. The short story \\"The Fifteen-Year Layover\\", written by Michael Paterniti and published in GQ and The Best American Non-Required Reading, chronicles Nasseri's life. Alexis Kouros made a documentary about him, Waiting for Godot at De Gaulle (2000). Glen Luchford and Paul Berczeller made the Here to Where mockumentary (2001), also featuring Nasseri. Hamid Rahmanian and Melissa Hibbard made a documentary called Sir Alfred of Charles De Gaulle Airport (2001). Nasseri was reportedly the inspiration behind the character Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks), from the 2004 Steven Spielberg film The Terminal; however, neither publicity materials, nor the DVD \\"special features\\" nor the film's website mentions Nasseri's situation as an inspiration for the film. Despite this, in September 2003, The New York Times noted that Steven Spielberg had bought the rights to his life story as the basis for The Terminal. The Guardian indicates that Spielberg's DreamWorks production company paid US$250,000 to Nasseri for rights to his story and report that, as of 2004, he carried a poster advertising Spielberg's film draping his suitcase next to his bench. Nasseri was reportedly excited about The Terminal, but it was unlikely that he would ever have had a chance to see it in cinemas. Nasseri's story was also the inspiration for the contemporary opera Flight by British composer Jonathan Dove, which won the Helpmann Award at the Adelaide Festival Theatre in March 2006.

In the third century, it progressed to balloon warfare. Airplanes were put to use for war starting in 1911, initially for reconnaissance, and then for aerial combat to shoot down the recon planes. The use of planes for strategic bombing emerged during World War II. Also during World War II, Nazi Germany developed many missile and precision-guided munition systems, including the first cruise missile, the first short-range ballistic missile, the first guided surface-to-air missiles, and the first anti-ship missiles. Ballistic missiles became of key importance during the Cold War, were armed with nuclear warheads, and were stockpiled by the superpowers (U.S. and the U.S.S.R) to deter each other from using them. The first military use of satellites was for reconnaissance in the 1950s, and their use has progressed to worldwide communication and information systems that support globally distributed military users with intelligence from orbit.  Kite warfare  The earliest documented aerial warfare took place in ancient China, when a manned kite was set off to spy for military intelligence and communication.Buckley (1999), pp. 22‚Äì23  Balloon warfare   Balloon warfare in ancient China  In or around the second or third century, a prototype hot air balloon, the Kongming lantern, was invented in China, serving as a military communication station.Boyne (2003), p.370 Note, Boyne p.370 does not mention the Kongming lantern by name.  Balloon warfare in Europe  Some minor warfare use was made of balloons in the infancy of aeronautics. The first instance was by the French Aerostatic Corps at the Battle of Fleurus in 1794, who used a tethered balloon, L'entreprenant, to gain a vantage point.Cooksley (1997), p.6Boyne (2003), pp.380‚Äì381 Balloons had disadvantages. They could not fly in bad weather, fog, or high winds. They were at the mercy of the winds and were also very large targets. Note, Buckley p.24 doesn't mention the large size of balloons being a vulnerability. American Civil War Battle of Fair Oaks with one of Lowe's balloons in the background = Union Army Balloon Corps = Prof. Lowe ascending in Intrepid to observe the Battle of Fair Oaks The American Civil War was the first war to witness significant use of aeronautics in support of battle. Thaddeus Lowe made noteworthy contributions to the Union war effort using a fleet of balloons he createdGross (2002), p.13 In June 1861 professor Thaddeus S. C. Lowe left his work in the private sector and offered his services as an Aeronaut to President Lincoln, who took some interest in the idea of an air war. Lowe's demonstration of flying a balloon over Washington, DC, and transmitting a telegraph message to the ground was enough to have him introduced to the commanders of the topographical engineers; Boyne, (2003), p.392-4 initially it was thought balloons could be used for preparing better maps. Lowe's first action was a free flight observation of the Confederate positions at the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861.Boyne (2003), p.395 Lowe was called to Fort Corcoran and ascended in order to spot rebel encampments. Collier (1974), p.11 With flag signals he directed artillery fire on the rebels. Lowe and other balloonists formed the Union Army Balloon Corps. Lowe insisted on the strict use of tethered (as opposed to free) flight because of concern about being shot down over enemy lines and punished as spies. By attaining altitudes from to as much as 3¬Ω miles, an expansive view of the battle field and beyond could be had. As the Confederates retreated, the war turned into the Peninsular Campaign. Due to the heavy forests on the peninsula, the balloons were unable to follow on land so a coal barge was converted to operate the balloons. The balloons and their gas generators were loaded aboard and taken down the Potomac, where reconnaissance of the peninsula could continue. At the Battle of Fair Oaks, Lowe was able to view the enemy army advancing and sent a dispatch to have reserves sent. The balloon corps was later assigned to the engineers corps.Boyne (2003), p.398 By August 1863, the Union Army Balloon Corps was disbanded.Buckley (1999), p.24 =Confederate Army= The Confederate Army also made use of balloons, but they were gravely hampered by lack of supplies due to embargoes. They were forced to fashion their balloons from colored silk dress-making material, and their use was limited by the infrequent supply of gas in Richmond, Virginia. By the summer of 1863, all balloon reconnaissance of the American Civil War had ceased. Before World War I Italian dirigibles bomb Turkish positions on Libyan territory. The Italo-Turkish War was the first in history to feature aerial bombardment by airplanes and airships.Biddle, Rhetoric and Reality in Air Warfare, pg.19 The United States Navy had been interested in naval aviation since the turn of the 20th century. Buckley (1999), p.57 Collier (1974), pp.82,91 In August 1910 Jacob Earl Fickel did the first experimenting with Glenn Curtiss shooting a gun from an airplane. In 1910‚Äì1911, the Navy conducted experiments which proved the practicality of carrier-based aviation. On November 14, 1910, near Hampton Roads, Virginia, civilian pilot Eugene Ely took off from a wooden platform installed on the scout cruiser USS Birmingham (CL-2). He landed safely on shore a few minutes later. Ely proved several months later that it was also possible to land on a ship. On January 18, 1911, he landed on a platform attached to the American cruiser USS Pennsylvania (ACR-4) in San Francisco harbor.Boyne (2003), p.36 Note, San Francisco harbor is not mentioned in Boyne p.36 The first use of airplanes in an actual war occurred in the 1911 Italo-Turkish War with Italian Army Air Corps Bl√©riot XI and Nieuport IV monoplanes bombing a Turkish camp at Ain Zara, Libya.Buckley (1999), p.38 In the First Balkan War (1912) the Bulgarian Air Force bombed Turkish positions at Adrianople, while the Greek Aviation performed, over the Dardanelles, the first naval air co-operation mission in history.Hellenic Air Force History : Balkan Wars. Airplanes were also used by the United States Army against Pancho Villa. Buckley (1999), p.36Gross (2002), p.26 Air reconnaissance was carried out in both wars too. The air-dropped bomb was extensively used during the First Balkan War (including in the first night bombing on 7 November 1912), and subsequently used by the Imperial German Air Service during World War I.

Sopwith Camel In World War I both sides initially made use of tethered balloons and airplanes for observation purposes, both for information gathering and directing of artillery fire. Buckley (1999), pp.47,50 A desire to prevent enemy observation led to airplane pilots attacking other airplanes and balloons, initially with small arms carried in the cockpit.Buckley (1999), pp.50,51 The addition of deflector plates to the back of propellers by French pilot Roland Garros and designer Raymond Saulnier in the Morane-Saulnier monoplane was the first example of an aircraft able to fire through its propeller, permitting Garros to score three victories in April 1915. Dutch aircraft designer Anthony Fokker developed a successful gun synchronizer in 1915, Buckley (1999), pp.51,52 Boyne (2003), p.77Warplane p.1 resulting in German Leutnant Kurt Wintgens scoring the first known victory for a synchronized gun-equipped fighter aircraft, on July 1, 1915. The Allies quickly developed their own synchronization gears, leading to the birth of aerial combat, more commonly known as dogfighting. Tactics for dogfighting evolved by trial and error. The German ace Oswald Boelcke created eight essential rules of dogfighting, the Dicta Boelcke. Buckley (1999), p.52Boyne (2003), p.78 Both sides also made use of aircraft for bombing, strafing, maritime reconnaissance, antisubmarine warfare, and the dropping of propaganda. The German military made use of Zeppelins and, later on, bombers such as the Gotha, to drop bombs on Southern England.Buckley (1999), pp.59,60Boyne (2003), pp.109,111Warplane p.2 By the end of the war airplanes had become specialized into bombers, fighters, and observation (reconnaissance) aircraft. By 1916, aerial combat had already progressed to the point where dogfighting tactics based on such doctrines as the Dicta Boelcke allowed air supremacy to be achieved. During the course of the war, new designs led to air supremacy shifting back and forth between the Germans and Allies. Interwar period Between 1918 and 1939 aircraft technology developed very rapidly. In 1918 most aircraft were biplanes with wooden frames, canvas skins, wire rigging and air-cooled engines. Biplanes continued to be the mainstay of air forces around the world and were used extensively in conflicts such as the Spanish Civil War.Buckley (1999), p.86 Most industrial countries also created air forces separate from the army and navy. However, by 1939 military biplanes were in the process of being replaced with metal framed monoplanes, often with stressed skins and liquid-cooled engines. Top speeds had tripled; altitudes doubled; ranges and payloads of bombers increased enormously. Buckley (1999), pp.68,109\\"Warplane\\" p.2 Some theorists, especially in Britain, considered that aircraft would become the dominant military arm in the future. Buckley (1999), p.3 They imagined that a future war would be won entirely by the destruction of the enemy's military and industrial capability from the air.Boyne (2003), p.138,139,149 The Italian general Giulio Douhet, author of The Command of the Air, was a seminal theorist of this school, which has been associated with Stanley Baldwin's statement that \\"the bomber will always get through\\"; that is, regardless of air defences, sufficient raiders will survive to rain destruction on the enemy's cities.Buckley (1999), p.14,75 This led to what would later be called a strategy of deterrence and a \\"bomber gap\\", as nations measured air force power by number of bombers.Buckley (1999), p.111Note, \\"bomber gap\\" is not mentioned in Buckley p.111 Others, such as General Billy Mitchell in the United States, saw the potential of air power to augment the striking power of naval surface fleets.Buckley (1999), p.91 German and British pilots had experimented with aerial bombing of ships and air- dropped torpedoes during World War I with mixed results. The vulnerability of capital ships to aircraft was demonstrated on 21 July 1921 when a squadron of bombers commanded by General Mitchell sank the ex-German battleship SMS Ostfriesland with aerial bombs; although the Ostfriesland was stationary and defenseless during the exercise, its destruction demonstrated the potency of air planes against ships.Boyne (2003), p.145 It was during the Banana Wars, while fighting bandits, freedom fighters and insurgents in places like Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua that United States Marine Corps aviators began to experiment with air-ground tactics to support Marines on the ground. It was in Haiti that the Marines began to experiment with dive bombing and in Nicaragua where they began to perfect it. While other nations and services had tried variations of this technique, Marine aviators were the first to include it in their tactical doctrineCorum & Johnson, \\"Small Wars\\", p. 23-40. Germany was banned from possessing an air force by the terms of the World War I armistice.Boyne (2003), pp.88,123,152 The German military continued to train its soldiers as pilots clandestinely until Hitler was ready to openly defy the ban. This was done by forming the Deutscher Luftsportverband, a flying enthusiast's club, Referred to as Deutsche Luftfahrt-Verband in Boyne (2003) p.154. and training pilots as civilians, and some German pilots were even sent to the Soviet Union for secret training; a trained air force was thus ready as soon as the word was given. This was the beginning of the Luftwaffe. Boyne (2003), pp.154,155,157 Collier (1974), p.94 World War II Military aviation came into its own during the Second World War. The increased performance, range, and payload of contemporary aircraft meant that air power could move beyond the novelty applications of World War I, becoming a central striking force for all the combatant nations.For an overview see Overy (1981) Over the course of the war, several distinct roles emerged for the application of air power. Strategic bombing A baby, whose dead mother lay nearby, crying in the ruins of a Shanghai Railway Station bombed by the Japanese in August 1937. After it appeared in LIFE magazine on Oct. 4, 1937, 136 million people worldwide saw it in newsreels and newspapers.see LIFE Nov 9, 1942 p 144 Strategic bombing of civilian targets from the air was first proposed by the Italian theorist General Giulio Douhet. In his book The Command of the Air (1921), Douhet argued future military leaders could avoid falling into bloody World War I‚Äìstyle trench stalemates by using aviation to strike past the enemy's forces directly at their vulnerable civilian populations. Douhet believed such strikes would cause these populations to force their governments to surrender.Buckley (1999), p.75Cooksley (1997), p.259Boyne (2003), p.138-9 Douhet's ideas were paralleled by other military theorists who emerged from World War I, including Sir Hugh Trenchard in Britain.Buckley (1999), p.77Boyne (2003), p.124 In the interwar period, Britain and the United States became the most enthusiastic supporters of the strategic bombing theory, with each nation building specialized heavy bombers specifically for this task.Buckley (1999), p.77,156 ;Japanese strategic bombing Strategic bombing, mostly targeting large Chinese cities, was independently conducted during the Second Sino-Japanese war and World War II by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service and the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service. There were also air raids on Philippines and Australia, as well as the cities in Burma and Malaysia. The Navy and Army air services used tactical bombing against ships and military positions, as at Pearl Harbor. ;Luftwaffe In the early days of World War II, the Luftwaffe launched devastating air attacks against besieged cities. During the Battle of Britain, the Luftwaffe, frustrated in its attempts to gain air superiority, turned to bombing British cities. However, these raids did not have the effect predicted by prewar theorists.Buckley (1999), p.131Boyne (2003), p.224 ;Soviet Red Air Force Although the rapid industrialization the Soviet Union experienced in the 1930s had the potential to enable the Soviet Air Forces to be effective against the Luftwaffe, Stalin's purges left the organization weakened. However, when Germany invaded in June 1941, the size of the Soviet Air Forces allowed it to absorb horrendous casualties and still maintain capability. Buckley (1999), pp.120,132,133Boyne (2003), pp.164,221 Despite the near collapse of Soviet forces in 1941, they survived, as German forces outran their supply lines and the Americans and British provided Lend Lease assistance.Richard Overy, Why the Allies Won (1997) ch 3 Although strategic bombing requires that the enemy's industrial war capacity be neutralized, some Soviet factories were moved far out of reach of the Luftwaffe's bombers.Boyne (2003), pp.220,221 Because the Luftwaffe's resources were needed to support the German army, the Luftwaffe became overstretched, and even victorious battles degraded Germany's air force due to attrition.Buckley (1999), pp. 76,132‚Äì134,141 By 1943, the Soviets were able to produce considerably more airplanes than their German rivals; for example, at Kursk, the Soviets had twice the number of airplanes that the Luftwaffe had.Buckley (1999), p.134 Utilizing overwhelming numerical superiority, Soviet forces were able to drive the Germans out of Soviet territory and take the war to Germany. ;Allied air forces in Europe The British started a strategic bombing campaign in 1940 that was to last for the rest of the war. Early British bombers were all twin- engined designs, and the 1939 Battle of the Heligoland Bight had shown the vulnerability of bombers to fighter attack. Therefore, RAF Bomber Command turned to a policy of area bombing at night.Buckley (1999), pp.5,154,155,157 Later in the war pathfinder tactics, radio location, ground mapping radar, and very low-level bombing enabled specific targets to be attacked. Part of a USAAF stream of over 1,000 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers. When the USAAF arrived in England in 1942, the Americans were convinced they could carry out successful daylight raids. The U.S. Eighth Air Force was equipped with high- altitude four-engined designs.Buckley (1999), pp.122,158 The new bombers also featured a stronger defensive armament. Flying in daylight in large formations, U.S. doctrine held tactical formations of heavy bombers would be sufficient to gain air superiority without escort fighters.Boyne (2003), pp.235‚Äì6 The intended raids would hit hard on chokepoints in the German war economy such as oil refineries or ball bearing factories.Gross (2002), p.113Boyne (2003), p.243 The USAAF was compelled to change its doctrine since bombers alone, no matter how heavily armed, could not achieve air superiority against single-engined fighters. In a series of missions in 1943 that penetrated beyond the range of fighter cover, there were loss rates up to twenty percent.Buckley (1999), p.159Boyne (2003), p.244-5Gross (2002), p.114 The Allies lost 160,000 airmen and 33,700 planes during World War II,Kenneth K. Hatfield (2003). \\"Heartland heroes: remembering World War II.\\". p.91. and almost 68,000 U.S. airmen died.Robert Pitta, Gordon Rottman, Jeff Fannell (1993). \\"US Army Air Force (1)\\". Osprey Publishing. p.3. ;Air superiority During the Battle of Britain, many of the best Luftwaffe pilots had been forced to bail out over British soil, where they were captured.Buckley (1999), pp.130‚Äì1 As the quality of the Luftwaffe fighter arm decreased, the Americans introduced the long-range escort fighters, carrying drop tanks such as the North American P-51 Mustang.Buckley (1999), pp.148,160 Boyne (2003), p.237 Newer, inexperienced German pilots‚Äîflying potentially superior aircraft, gradually became less and less effective at thinning the late-war bomber streams.Buckley (1999), pp.160,161 Adding fighters to the daylight raids gave the bombers much-needed protection and greatly improved the impact of the strategic bombing effort.Buckley (1999), pp.149‚Äì151Gross (2002), pp.114‚Äì115 Over time, from 1942 to 1944, the Allies' air forces became stronger while the Luftwaffe weakened. During 1944, Germany's air force lost control of Germany's skies. As a result, nothing in Germany could be protected whether it was army units, factories, civilians in cities, or even the nation's capital. German soldiers and civilians began to be slaughtered in the thousands by aerial bombardment.Buckley (1999), pp.158‚Äì161,163 ;Effectiveness Strategic bombing by non-atomic means did not however win the war for the Allies, nor did it succeed in breaking the will to resist of the German (and Japanese) people.Buckley (1999), pp.164‚Äì166,193‚Äì194Gross (2002), pp.138,199 But in the words of the German armaments minister Albert Speer, it created \\"a second front in the air.\\" Speer succeeded in increasing the output of armaments right up to mid-1944 in spite of the bombing.Buckley (1999), p.165 Still, the war against the British and American bombers demanded enormous amounts of resources: antiaircraft guns, day and night fighters, radars, searchlights, manpower, ammunition, and fuel.Buckley (1999), p.166Gross (2002), p.137-8 On the Allied side, strategic bombing diverted material resources, equipment (such as radar) aircraft, and manpower away from the Battle of the Atlantic and Allied armies. As a result, German army groups in Russia, Italy, and France rarely saw friendly aircraft and constantly ran short of tanks, trucks, and anti-tank weapons. ;U.S. Bombing of Japan In June 1944, Boeing B-29 Superfortresses launched from China, bombed Japanese factories. From November 1944, increasingly intense raids were launched from bases closer to Japan. Tactics evolved from high-altitude to lower altitude attacks, largely removing most defensive guns and switching to incendiary bombs. These attacks devastated many Japanese cities. In August 1945, B-29 Superfortresses dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki while the Soviets invaded Manchuria. The Japanese then surrendered unconditionally, officially ending World War II. Tactical air support By contrast with the British strategists, the primary purpose of the Luftwaffe was to support the Army. This accounted for the presence of large numbers of medium bombers and dive bombers on strength and the scarcity of long-range heavy bombers. This 'flying artillery' greatly assisted in the successes of the German Army in the Battle of France (1940) .Boyne (2003), pp.207‚Äì8 Hitler determined air superiority was essential for the invasion of Britain. When this was not achieved in the Battle of Britain, the invasion was canceled, making this the first major battle whose outcome was determined primarily in the air. Boyne (2003), pp.215,224 The war in Russia forced the Luftwaffe to devote the majority of its resources to providing tactical air support for the beleaguered German army. In that role, the Luftwaffe used the Junkers Ju 87, Henschel Hs 123 and modified fighters such as Messerschmitt Bf 109s and Focke-Wulf Fw 190s. Buckley (1999), p.133 The Red Air Force was also primarily used in the tactical support role, and towards the end of the war was very effective in the support of the Red Army in its advance across Eastern Europe.Buckley (1999), pp.145‚Äì146 An aircraft of major importance to the Soviets was the Ilyushin Il-2 Sturmovik \\"flying artillery\\" which made life very difficult for panzer crews, and the Il-2 played an important part in the Soviet victory in one of the biggest tank battles in history at Kursk. Boyne (2003), p.223 Military transport and use of airborne troops Military transport was invaluable to all sides in maintaining supply and communications of ground troops, and was used on many notable occasions such as resupply of German troops in and around Stalingrad after Operation Uranus, and employment of airborne troops. Buckley (1999), p.6Boyne (2003), p.221Note, neither Buckley p.6 nor Boyne p.221 mention Operation Uranus. After the first trials in use of airborne troops by the Red Army displayed in the early 1930s many European nations and Japan also formed airborne troops, and these saw extensive service on in all theatres of the Second World War. However their effectiveness as shock troops employed to surprise enemy static troops proved to be of limited success. Most airborne troops served as light infantry by the end of the war despite attempts at massed use in the Western Theatre by US and Britain during Operation Market Garden. Naval aviation Mitsubishi A6M2 Zero fighter heads for Pearl Harbor Aircraft and the aircraft carrier first became important in naval battles in World War II. Carrier-based aircraft were specialized as dive bombers, torpedo bombers, and fighters. Surface-based aircraft such as the Consolidated PBY Catalina and Short Sunderland helped finding submarines and surface fleets. The aircraft carrier replaced the battleship as the most powerful naval offensive weapons system as battles between fleets were increasingly fought out of gun range by aircraft. The Yamato, the most powerful battleship ever built was first turned back by light escort carrier aircraft, and later sunk due to it lacking its own air cover. The US launched US Army Air Forces land-based bombers from United States Navy carriers in a raid against Tokyo. Smaller carriers were built in large numbers to escort slow cargo convoys or supplement fast carriers. Aircraft for observation or light raids were also carried by battleships and cruisers, while blimps were used to search for attack submarines. In the Battle of the Atlantic, aircraft carried by low-cost escort carriers were used for antisubmarine patrol, defense, and attack. At the start of the Pacific War in 1941, Japanese carrier-based aircraft sank several US battleships at Pearl Harbor and land- based aircraft sank two large British warships. Engagements between Japanese and American naval fleets were then conducted largely or entirely by aircraft including the battles of Coral Sea, Midway, Bismarck Sea and Philippine Sea.Boyne (2003), pp.227‚Äì8 Cold War Military aviation in the post-war years was dominated by the needs of the Cold War. The post-war years saw the almost total conversion of combat aircraft to jet power, which resulted in enormous increases in speeds and altitudes of aircraft.Gross (2002), p.151 Until the advent of the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile major powers relied on high-altitude bombers to deliver their newly developed nuclear deterrent and each country strove to develop the technology of bombers and the high- altitude fighters that could intercept them. The concept of air superiority began to play a heavy role in aircraft designs for both the United States and the Soviet Union. Boyne (2003), p.303 The Americans developed and made extensive use of the high-altitude observation aircraft for intelligence- gathering. The Lockheed U-2, and later the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird were developed in great secrecy. The U-2 at its time was expected to be invulnerable to defensive measures due to its extreme altitude capabilities. It therefore came as a shock when the Soviets downed one piloted by Gary Powers with a surface-to-air missile. Air combat was also transformed through increased use of air-to-air guided missiles with increased sophistication in guidance and increased range. In the 1970s and 1980s it became clear that speed and altitude was not enough to protect a bomber against air defences. The emphasis shifted therefore to maneuverable attack aircraft that could fly 'under the radar', at altitudes of a few hundred feet. Korean War MiG-15 shot down by a USAF North American F-86 Sabre over MiG Alley Over the course of the war, at least 16 USAF Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers were shot down by communist aircraft. The Korean War was best remembered for jet combat, but was one of the last major wars where propeller-powered fighters such as the North American P-51 Mustang, Vought F4U Corsair and aircraft carrier-based Hawker Sea Fury and Supermarine Seafire were used. Turbojet fighter aircraft such as Lockheed F-80 Shooting Stars, Republic F-84 Thunderjets and Grumman F9F Panthers came to dominate the skies, overwhelming North Korea's propeller- driven Yakovlev Yak-9s and Lavochkin La-9s. From 1950, North Koreans flew the Soviet-made MiG-15 jet fighters which introduced the near-sonic speeds of swept wings to air combat. Though an open secret during the war, the most formidable pilots today now admit that they were experienced Soviet Air Force pilots, a casus belli deliberately overlooked by the UN allied forces who suspected the use of Russians but were reluctant to engage in open war with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. At first, UN jet fighters, which also included Royal Australian Air Force Gloster Meteors, had some success, but straight winged jets were soon outclassed in daylight by the superior speed of the MiGs. At night, however, radar-equipped Marine Corps Douglas F3D Skynight night fighters claimed five MiG kills with no losses of their own,Grossnick, Roy A. and William J. Armstrong. United States Naval Aviation, 1910‚Äì1995. Annapolis, Maryland: Naval Historical Center, 1997. . and no B-29s under their escort were lost to enemy fighters. In December 1950, the U.S. Air Force rushed in their own swept-wing fighter, the North American F-86 Sabre. The MiG could fly higher, 50,000 vs. , offering a distinct advantage at the start of combat. In level flight, their maximum speeds were comparable at about . The MiG could climb better, while the Sabre could dive better with an all-flying tailplane. For weapons, the MiG carried two 23 mm and one 37 mm cannon, compared to the Sabre's six .50 (12.7 mm) caliber machine guns. The American .50 caliber machine guns, while not packing the same punch, carried many more rounds and were aimed with a more accurate radar-ranging gunsight. The U.S. pilots also had the advantage of G-suits, which were used for the first time in this war. Even after the Air Force introduced the advanced F-86, its pilots often struggled against the jets piloted by Soviet pilots, dubbed \\"honchos\\". The UN gradually gained air superiority over most of Korea that lasted until the end of the war. It was a decisive factor in helping the UN first advance into the north, and then resist the Chinese invasion of South Korea. After the war, the USAF claimed 792 MiG-15s and 108 additional aircraft shot down by Sabres for the loss of 78 Sabres. Later research reduced the total to 379 victories which is still higher than the 345 losses shown in USSR records. The Soviets claimed about 1,100 air-to-air victories and 335 combat MiG losses at that time. China's official losses were 231 planes shot down in air-to-air combat (mostly MiG-15s) and 168 other losses. The number of losses of the North Korean Air Force was not revealed. It is estimated that it lost about 200 aircraft in the first stage of the war, and another 70 aircraft after Chinese intervention. Soviet claims of 650 victories over the Sabres, and China's claims of another 211 F-86s, are considered to be exaggerated by the USAF. H-19 were used in the Korean war. The Korean war was the first time the helicopter was used extensively in a conflict. While helicopters such as the Sikorsky YR-4 were used in World War II, their use was rare, and Jeeps like the Willys MB were the main method of removing an injured soldier. In the Korean war helicopters like the Sikorsky H-19 partially took over in the non combat Medevac area. Indo-Pakistani Wars During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, both air forces engaged each other for the first time in full scale combat since independence. Both countries hold contradictory combat loss claims for the war and no neutral sources have verified them. The Pakistani Air Force (PAF) claimed 104 Indian Air Force (IAF) aircraft while losing only 19 in the process. India meanwhile claims they lost 35 aircraft while shooting down 73 Pakistani aircraft. During the war, the numerically larger IAF, was not able to achieve any air superiority over qualitatively superior Pakistan Air Force. By the time of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the Indian Air force had both the qualitative as well as numerical edge with large numbers of Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21s in service. The war began with Operation Chengiz Khan, Pakistan's December 3, 1971 pre-emptive strike on 11 Indian airbases. After the initial preemptive strike, the PAF adopted a defensive stance in response to the Indian retaliation. As the war progressed, the Indian Air Force continued to fight the PAF over conflict zones, but the number of sorties flown by the PAF gradually decreased day-by-day. The Indian Air Force flew 4,000 sorties while its counterpart, the PAF offered 3,300 in retaliation, partly because of shortages of non-Bengali technical personnel. The PAF succeeded to intervene during the Indian Navy's two raids on Pakistani naval port city of Karachi codenamed Operation Trident and Operation Python and was able to support its troops during Battle of Longewala. In the east, the Pakistan Air Forces No. 14 Sqn was destroyed, putting the only Dhaka airfield in East Pakistan out of commission and allowing in Indian air force to fly in the east. Vietnam War UH-1Ds during early \\"Air Cav\\" operations, 1966. The Republic of Vietnam Air Force (VNAF) was originally equipped with helicopters such as the Piasecki CH-21 and propeller powered aircraft such as the North American T-28 Trojan when jet aircraft were disallowed by treaty. As US involvement increased, most aircraft were flown by US forces. Large scale use of helicopters by the US Army in Vietnam led to a new class of airmobile troops, and the introduction of \\"Air Cavalry\\" in the U.S, culminating in extensive use of the Bell UH-1 Huey helicopter which would become a symbol of that war, Gross (2002), p.199UH-1 while the Sikorsky CH-54 Tarhe \\"Skycrane\\" and Boeing-Vertol CH-47 Chinook lifted heavier loads such as vehicles or artillery. Troops were able to land unexpectedly, strike, and leave again, and evacuate wounded.Gross (2002), p.201 The specialized AH-1 Cobra was developed from the Huey for escort and ground support duties, The later Soviet campaign in Afghanistan would also see widespread use of helicopters as part of the Air Assault brigades and regiments. US forces provided close support of ground force over South Vietnam, and strategic bombing of targets over North Vietnam. Many types flying close support or COIN (Counter Insurgency Warfare) missions were propeller powered types such as the Cessna O-1 Bird Dog and North American OV-10 Bronco FAC spotters, Douglas A-1 Skyraider, Douglas B-26 Invader, and Douglas AC-47 Spooky gunship. Fairchild C-123 Provider and Lockheed C-130 Hercules transports flew supplies into battlefields such as Khe Sanh. Boyne (2003), p.321 \\"Fast movers\\" included the supersonic North American F-100 Super Sabre, while the giant Boeing B-52 Stratofortress would be modified to unload a massive high explosive payload on enemy troop concentrations. Buckley (1999), p.215 The Lockheed AC-130 would become the ultimate gunship, Boyne (2003), p.319 while the AX specification to replace the Skyraider would evolve into the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II.Note, Gross p.225 does not mention the AX specification. USAF Republic F-105 Thunderchiefs flew the bulk of strike missions against North Vietnam in Operation Rolling Thunder, while carrier-based Douglas A-4 Skyhawks (which could \\"buddy-buddy\\" refuel) were flown by the Navy. That first campaign was marred by carefully measured regulations that prohibited attacks against SAM missile sites and fighter bases, and frequent bombing halts, and produced little in political results.Boyne (2003), p.327,329Note, Boyne does not mention A-4's in conjunction with Operation Rolling Thunder. Rolling Thunder saw the first combat use of electronic computers aboard PIRAZ ships to display comprehensive real-time aircraft position information for force commanders.Lockee, April 1969, p.143 Republic F-105D Thunderchief shoots down a MiG-17, 1967. Lessons learned were applied to the later Operation Linebacker which employed McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, B-52 Stratofortresses, swing-wing General Dynamics F-111 Aardvarks, LTV A-7 Corsair IIs and all-weather Grumman A-6 Intruders was more successful in bringing North Vietnam to the negotiating table after a massive ground invasion. North Vietnam effectively combined Soviet and Chinese anti-aircraft artillery, SA-2 guided missiles, and MiG fighters to create the most heavily defended airspace up to that time. Boyne (2003), p.336-7 Boyne (2003), p.338-9 US air strikes would combine the use of airborne radar platforms such as the Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star, Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers for air refueling, radar jamming aircraft and specialized \\"Wild Weasel\\" units to attack SAM missile sites. Boyne (2003), p.331 Gross (2002), p.216 Jolly Green Giant helicopter crews escorted by Douglas A-1 Skyraiders (\\"Sandy\\"s) would retrieve downed pilots over hostile territory.With the use of \\"smart\\" guided bombs late in the war, this would set the model for future US air operations. Experts were surprised when advanced F-105s were shot down in its first encounter against the elderly but nimble MiG-17. Dogfights were thought to be obsolete in the age of missiles, but pilots now needed maneuverability. The McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II was quickly tasked with protecting against MiGs, but lacked a built-in gun when missiles were still very unreliable. Gross (2002), p.213 Air combat training schools such as TOPGUN would improve kill ratios, but combat experience started programs that would produce agile air superiority fighters with guns such as the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle by the 1970s.Gross (2002), p.225 South Vietnam fell without US air support when faced with a massive assault in 1975. The VNAF Republic of Vietnam Air Force was never supplied with powerful fighters and bombers such as the F-4 Phantom and B-52 which could strike at North Vietnam. Middle East In the Six-Day War of 1967, the Israeli Air Force launched pre-emptive strikes which destroyed opposing Arab air forces on the ground. Boyne (2003), p.345-6 The Yom Kippur War of 1973 saw the Arab deployment of mobile 2K12 Kub (SA-6) missiles which proved effective against low-flying Israeli aircraft until they were neutralized by ground forces. Boyne (2003), p.348-9 Iran‚ÄìIraq War In the Iran‚ÄìIraq War (1980‚Äì1988), the use of aerial warfare was continuous. At the war's beginning Iraq attempted to destroy the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force by bombing its airfields but failed due to lack of pilot training and Iranian air base defenses.Tom Hooper and Farzad Bishop, Iran‚ÄìIraq War in the Air 1980‚Äì1988, Schiffer Military History, 2000. Falklands War (1982) During the six- week Falklands War British carrier-based British Aerospace Sea Harrier and Hawker Siddeley Harrier flew over 1500 sorties and Avro Vulcans flew long- range bombing missions. 21 Argentine fixed-aircraft were destroyed in the air by British Harriers and Sea Harriers. A further 18 Argentine fixed-wing aircraft were destroyed by British Surface to Air Missiles. 15 Argentine fixed-wing aircraft were destroyed on the ground and 14 were captured. Sixty eight Argentine fixed-wing aircraft were captured or destroyed by British Forces, representing 28% of the 240 fixed-wing aircraft the Argentinians had at the start of the war. When accidents and friendly fire are included, 31% of the total 240 fixed-wing aircraft were lost. Post Cold War U.S. Air Force fighters flying over a burning oil field during Operation Desert Storm. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 forced Western air forces to undergo a shift from the massive numbers felt to be necessary during the Cold War to smaller numbers of multi-role aircraft. The closure of several military bases overseas and the U.S. Base Realignment and Closure program have served to highlight the effectiveness of aircraft carriers in the absence of dedicated military or air force's bases, as the Falklands war and U.S. operations in the Persian Gulf have highlighted. The advent of precision-guided munitions have allowed for strikes at arbitrary surface targets once proper reconnaissance is performed (network-centric warfare). The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) has noted that sales of combat aircraft can have a destabilizing effect because of their ability to quickly strike neighboring countries, such as during Operation Orchard in 2007 when the Israelis unilaterally attacked Syria.Katz, Yaakov. \\"Israel, UAE, India lead world fighter jet buys.\\" Jerusalem Post, 14 November 2010 Gulf War (1991) The role of air power in modern warfare was dramatically demonstrated during the Gulf War in 1991. Air attacks were made on Iraqi command and control centers, communications facilities, supply depots, and reinforcement forces. Air superiority over Iraq was gained before major ground combat began.Boyne (2003), p.359,360 The initial strikes were composed of Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from ships, Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk stealth bombers with an armament of laser-guided bombs, and aircraft armed with anti-radar missiles. These first attacks destroyed the air defence network and allowed fighter- bombers to gain air superiority over the country. Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt IIs attacked Iraqi armored forces with Gatling guns and Maverick missiles, supporting the advance of US ground troops. Attack helicopters, fired laser guided Hellfire missiles and TOW missiles.Gross (2002), p.235 The allied air fleet also made use of AWACS aircraft and Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bombers.Gross (2002), p.226-7 The aerial strike force was made up of over 2,250 combat aircraft, which included 1,800 US aircraft, which fought against an Iraqi force of about 500 primarily composed of MiG-29 and Mirage F1 fighters. More than 88,000 combat missions had been flown by allied forces with over 88,000 tons of bombs dropped by the end of the fifth week. Kargil War (1999) On 11 May 1999, the Indian Air Force was called in to provide helicopters for close air support to the Indian Army at the height of the Kargil conflict with Pakistan. The first strikes were launched on the 26 May, when the Indian Air Force struck infiltrator positions with fighter aircraft and helicopter gunships. The initial strikes saw MiG-27s carrying out offensive sorties, with MiG-21s and MiG-29s providing fighter cover. The IAF also deployed radars and MiG-29 fighters to keep check on Pakistani military movements across the border. On 27 May, the IAF lost a MiG-21 to enemy action and a MiG-27 to mechanical failure. The following day, a Mi-17 was lost to SAMs while on an offensive sortie. These losses forced the IAF to withdraw helicopters from offensive roles. On 30 May, the IAF called into operation the Mirage 2000 which was deemed the best aircraft in the high-altitude conditions. Mirage 2000s not only had better defence equipment compared to the MiGs, but also gave IAF the ability to carry out aerial raids at night. Indian MiG-29s were used extensively during the 1999 Kargil War in Kashmir by the Indian Air Force to provide fighter escort for Mirage 2000s, which were attacking targets with laser-guided bombs. Kargil War finally came to end with a Decisive Indian Military and Diplomatic Victory. Iraq War (2003‚Äì2010) A USAF F-15E Strike Eagle launches heat decoys during a close-air-support mission over Afghanistan, 2008. During the 2003 invasion of Iraq led by US and British forces putatively to defeat the regime of Saddam Hussein, aerial warfare continued to be decisive. The US-British alliance began its air campaign on March 19 with limited nighttime bombing on the Iraqi capital of Baghdad. Several days later, intensive bombardment began. About 14,000 sorties were flown, and at a cost of $1 million each, 800 Tomahawk cruise missiles were fired at numerous targets in Iraq from March 19 until mid-April 2003. By this time Iraqi resistance had largely ended. Iraqi anti-aircraft weapons were unable to open fire on high-altitude US bombers such as the B-52 or stealth aircraft such as the B-2 bomber and the F-117A. US and British aircraft used radar-detecting devices and aerial reconnaissance to locate Iraqi anti- aircraft weapons. Bunker buster bombs, designed to penetrate and destroy underground bunkers, were dropped on Iraqi command and control centers. Iraqi ground forces could not seriously challenge the American ground forces because of their air supremacy. By mid-April 2003, US-British forces controlled all of Iraq's major cities and oil fields.  2006 Lebanon War  In the beginning of the 2006 Lebanon War, Israel utilized an intensive aerial campaign aimed to eliminate Hezbollah and destroy its military, as stated by Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert. It also aimed to return kidnapped Israeli soldiers. The campaign started by destroying Lebanese infrastructure and Hezbollah targets. This continued during the 33 days of the war. Taking into consideration the results of the 1991 and 2003 wars on Iraq and the 1999 war on the former Yugoslavia, the Israeli air force was unable to accomplish its objectives as completely. This partly results from the military doctrine that Hezbollah used in the war which proved effective. There have also been reports during the conflict that a Hezbollah-operated flying drone penetrated Israeli airspace, and returned to Lebanese territory. Hezbollah drone threatens Israel . NBC News.

Owned by Tribune Publishing, it circulates all throughout the three counties that comprise South Florida. It is the largest-circulation newspaper in the area. Nancy Meyer has held the position of publisher and Julie Anderson has held the position of editor-in- chief since February 2018. The newspaper was for many years branded as the Sun-Sentinel, with a hyphen, until a redesign and rebranding on August 17, 2008. The new look also removed the space between \\"Sun\\" and \\"Sentinel\\" in the newspaper's flag, but its name retained the space. Overview For many years, the Sun Sentinel targeted Broward County and provided only limited news coverage in Palm Beach County. However, in the late 1990s, it expanded its coverage to all of South Florida, including Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties, in the late 1990s. In the former area, The Miami Herald is its primary competition, while in the latter area, The Palm Beach Post is the chief competition. The Sun Sentinel emphasizes local news, through its Community News and Local sections. It has a daily circulation of 163,728 and a Sunday circulation of 228,906. The paper was awarded its first Pulitzer Prize in 2013, in the category of Public Service Journalism, for its investigative series about off-duty police officers who engage in regular reckless speeding. In 2019, the paper won another Pulitzer Prize for public service for its coverage of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, a school shooting in which 17 people died. The Pulitzer committee credited the Sun Sentinel \\"for exposing failings by school and law enforcement officials before and after the deadly shooting rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\\" The newspaper has also been a finalist for a Pulitzer 13 times, including for its 2005 coverage of Hurricane Wilma and an investigation into the Federal Emergency Management Agency's mismanagement of hurricane aid. (The latter investigation was featured in the PBS documentary series Expos√©: America's Investigative Reports in an episode entitled \\"Crisis Mismanagement\\".) It also produced a significant contribution to information graphics in the form of News Illustrated, a weekly full-page graphic that has received more than 30 international awards. The photography department has been a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize twice in the Spot News category. It was a finalist in 1982 for its coverage of a Haitian refugee boat disaster, and again in 1999 for its powerful coverage of Hurricane Mitch in Central America. The Sun Sentinel website has news video from two South Florida television stations: West Palm Beach's CBS affiliate WPEC and Miami and Fort Lauderdale CW affiliate WSFL-TV; it was a former sister station to the latter before Tribune's publishing and broadcasting interests were split. It also publishes a Spanish-language weekly, El Sentinel, as well as various community publications. History The Sun Sentinel traces its history to the 1910 founding of the Fort Lauderdale Weekly Herald, the first known newspaper in the Fort Lauderdale area, and the Everglades Breeze, a locally printed paper founded in 1911, which promoted itself as \\"Florida's great Farm, Truck and Fruit Growing paper.\\" In 1925, the Everglades Breeze was renamed the Sentinel. That same year, two Ohio publishers bought both the Sentinel and the Herald, consolidating the newspapers into a daily publication called the Daily News and Evening Sentinel. In 1926, Horace and Tom Stillwell purchased the paper. However, the devastation wrought by the 1926 Miami hurricane caused circulation to drop and, in 1929, Tom Stillwell sold the paper to the Gore Publishing Company, headed by R.H. Gore Sr. By 1945, circulation of the Daily News and Evening Sentinel had climbed to 10,000. In 1953, Gore Publishing changed the name of the paper to the Fort Lauderdale News and added a Sunday morning edition. In 1960, when the paper had a circulation of 60,000, Gore Publishing purchased the weekly Pompano Beach Sun and expanded it into a six- day morning paper, the Pompano Sun-Sentinel‚Äîthus reviving the \\"Sentinel\\" name it had discarded seven years earlier. In 1963, the Tribune Company acquired Gore Publishing. In the 1970s, the morning paper changed its name to the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel. In 1982, the two papers merged their editorial staffs. The two papers then merged into a single morning paper under the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel name. In 2000, after expanding its coverage, the paper changed its name to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. In 2001, the Sun-Sentinel opened a full-time foreign bureau in Havana, Cuba. Shared with the Tribune Co., their Havana newsroom was the only permanent presence of any South Florida newspaper at the time. In 2002, the Sun-Sentinel began publishing a Spanish weekly newspaper, El Sentinel. The newspaper is distributed free on Saturdays to Hispanic households in Broward and Palm Beach counties and is also available in racks in both counties. It is also available online at Elsentinel.com. In 2004, the paper won the Payne Award for Ethics in Journalism for its coverage of health and human services in the state. On August 17, 2008, the Sun Sentinel unveiled a redesigned layout, with larger graphics, more color, and a new large \\"S\\" logo. This is in tune with another Tribune newspaper (Orlando Sentinel), which redesigned its newspaper a few months previously, and created a brand synergy with Tribune sister operation and CW affiliate WSFL-TV (Channel 39), which relocated its operations to the Sun Sentinel offices in 2008 and adopted a logo matching the capital \\"S\\" in the new logo. Since 2011 to present day, the newspaper made significant updates to meld print media with modern media. These advances include: launching the pure-play entertainment website SouthFlorida.com and starting a video channel called SunSentinel Originals. As a result of their media integration, the newspaper was named one of Editor & Publisher's \\"10 Newspapers That Do it Right\\". Awards The Sun Sentinel gives annual awards to area businesses and business leaders, including Top Workplaces for People on the Move, Excalibur Award and others. In April 2013, the Sun Sentinel won its first gold medal Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. In 2014 the newspaper was named one of the \\"10 Newspapers That Do It Right\\" by Editor & Publisher magazine. The Sun Sentinel won its second Pulitzer for Public Service in 2019. UAL Glitch A 2008 glitch that began with a six-year-old Chicago Tribune article posted on Sun Sentinels website resulted in finger-pointing regarding \\"who is to blame over the United Airlines share price crash ... from $12 to $3 before trading was suspended.\\" The posting was on a Sunday, and by Thursday Reuters reported a formal SEC \\"preliminary investigation,\\" including that a previously known aspect of Google's search engine was involved: the old story was presented as \\"new\\" by Google News. UAL's share price was described as \\"later recovered.\\" References External links * - unavailable in most European countries * Newspapers published in Florida Mass media in the Miami metropolitan area Broward County, Florida Palm Beach County, Florida Tribune Publishing 1910 establishments in Florida Publications established in 1910 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service winners ","title":"Sun-Sentinel"},{"id":"715882","text":"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11Œ≤-hydroxylase deficiency is a form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) which produces a higher than normal amount of androgen, resulting from a defect in the gene encoding the enzyme steroid 11Œ≤-hydroxylase (11Œ≤-OH) which mediates the final step of cortisol synthesis in the adrenal. 11Œ≤-OH CAH results in hypertension due to excessive mineralocorticoid effects. It also causes excessive androgen production both before and after birth and can virilize a genetically female fetus or a child of either sex. Presentation Mineralocorticoid effects Mineralocorticoid manifestations of severe 11Œ≤-hydroxylase deficient CAH can be biphasic, changing from deficiency (salt-wasting) in early infancy to excess (hypertension) in childhood and adult life. Salt-wasting in early infancy does not occur in most cases of 11Œ≤-OH CAH but can occur because of impaired production of aldosterone aggravated by inefficiency of salt conservation in early infancy. When it occurs it resembles the salt-wasting of severe 21-hydroxylase deficient CAH: poor weight gain and vomiting in the first weeks of life progress and culminate in life-threatening dehydration, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic acidosis in the first month. Despite the inefficient production of aldosterone, the more characteristic mineralocorticoid effect of 11Œ≤-OH CAH is hypertension. Progressive adrenal hyperplasia due to persistent elevation of ACTH results in extreme overproduction of 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) by mid-childhood. DOC is a weak mineralocorticoid, but usually reaches high enough levels in this disease to cause effects of mineralocorticoid excess: salt retention, volume expansion, and hypertension. Sex steroid effects Because 11Œ≤-hydroxylase activity is not necessary in the production of sex steroids (androgens and estrogens), the hyperplastic adrenal cortex produces excessive amounts of DHEA, androstenedione, and especially testosterone. These androgens produce effects that are similar to those of 21-hydroxylase deficient CAH. In the severe forms, XX (genetically female) fetuses can be markedly virilized, with ambiguous genitalia that look more male than female, though internal female organs, including ovaries and uterus develop normally. XY fetuses (genetic males) typically show no abnormal features related to androgen excess. A megalopenis (>22 cm/8.7in) is usually present in male patients. In milder mutations, androgen effects in both sexes appear in mid-childhood as early pubic hair, overgrowth, and accelerated bone age. Although \\"nonclassic\\" forms causing hirsutism and menstrual irregularities and appropriate steroid elevations have been reported, most have not had verifiable mutations and mild 11Œ≤-hydroxylase deficient CAH is currently considered a very rare cause of hirsutism and infertility. All of the issues related to virilization, neonatal assignment, advantages and disadvantages of genital surgery, childhood and adult virilization, gender identity and sexual orientation are similar to those of 21-hydroxylase CAH and elaborated in more detail in Congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Pathophysiology 11Œ≤-OH CAH is autosomal recessive. The enzyme which mediates 11Œ≤-hydroxylase activity is now known as P450c11Œ≤ since it is one of the cytochrome P450 oxidase enzymes located in the inner mitochondrial membrane of cells of the adrenal cortex. It is coded by a gene at 8q21-22. Like the other forms of CAH, a number of different defective alleles for the gene have been identified, producing varying degrees of impaired 11Œ≤-hydroxylase activity. Also like the other forms of CAH, 11Œ≤-OH CAH is inherited as an autosomal recessive disease. 11Œ≤-Hydroxylase mediates the final step of the glucocorticoid pathway, producing cortisol from 11-deoxycortisol. It also catalyzes the conversion of 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) to corticosterone in the mineralocorticoid pathway. Diagnosis Classification Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) refers to any of several autosomal recessive diseases resulting from defects in steps of the synthesis of cortisol from cholesterol by the adrenal glands. All of the forms of CAH involve excessive or defective production of sex steroids and can prevent or impair development of primary or secondary sex characteristics in affected infants, children, and adults. Many also involve excessive or defective production of mineralocorticoids, which can cause hypertension or salt wasting, respectively. The most common type of CAH is due to deficiency of 21-hydroxylase. 11Œ≤-Hydroxylase deficient congenital adrenal hyperplasia is one of the less common types of CAH due to deficiencies of other proteins and enzymes involved in cortisol synthesis. Other uncommon types are described in individual articles (links below). 11Œ≤-OH CAH resembles 21-hydroxylase deficient CAH in its androgenic manifestations: partial virilization and ambiguous genitalia of genetically female infants, childhood virilization of both sexes, and rarer cases of virilization or infertility of adolescent and adult women. The mineralocorticoid effect differs: hypertension is usually the clinical clue that a patient has 11- rather than 21-hydroxylase CAH. Diagnosis of 11Œ≤-OH CAH is usually confirmed by demonstration of marked elevations of 11-deoxycortisol and 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC), the substrates of 11Œ≤-hydroxylase. Management is similar to that of 21-hydroxylase deficient CAH except that mineralocorticoids need not be replaced. Management As with other forms of CAH, the primary therapy of 11Œ≤-hydroxylase deficient CAH is lifelong glucocorticoid replacement in sufficient doses to prevent adrenal insufficiency and suppress excess mineralocorticoid and androgen production. Salt-wasting in infancy responds to intravenous saline, dextrose, and high dose hydrocortisone, but prolonged fludrocortisone replacement is usually not necessary. The hypertension is ameliorated by glucocorticoid suppression of DOC. Long term glucocorticoid replacement issues are similar to those of 21-hydroxylase CAH, and involve careful balance between doses sufficient to suppress androgens while avoiding suppression of growth. Because the enzyme defect does not affect sex steroid synthesis, gonadal function at puberty and long-term fertility should be normal if adrenal androgen production is controlled. See congenital adrenal hyperplasia for a more detailed discussion of androgen suppression and fertility potential in adolescent and adult women.

For example, a TDC might output the time of arrival for each incoming pulse. Some applications wish to measure the time interval between two events rather than some notion of an absolute time. In electronics time-to-digital converters (TDCs) or time digitizers are devices commonly used to measure a time interval and convert it into digital (binary) output. In some cases interpolating TDCs are also called time counters (TCs). TDCs are used in many different applications, where the time interval between two signal pulses (start and stop pulse) should be determined. Measurement is started and stopped, when either the rising or the falling edge of a signal pulse crosses a set threshold. These requirements are fulfilled in many physical experiments, like time-of-flight and lifetime measurements in atomic and high energy physics, experiments that involve laser ranging and electronic research involving the testing of integrated circuits and high-speed data transfer. Application TDCs are used in applications where measurement events happen infrequently, such as high energy physics experiments, where the sheer number of data channels in most detectors ensures that each channel will be excited only infrequently by particles such as electrons, photons, and ions. Coarse measurement oscillator or delay line or distributed amplifier runs at a flip-flop compatible frequency, but has sharper edges and sub-edge resolution If the required time resolution is not high, then counters can be used to make the conversion. Basic counter In its simplest implementation, a TDC is simply a high-frequency counter that increments every clock cycle. The current contents of the counter represents the current time. When an event occurs, the counter's value is captured in an output register. In that approach, the measurement is an integer number of clock cycles, so the measurement is quantized to a clock period. To get finer resolution, a faster clock is needed. The accuracy of the measurement depends upon the stability of the clock frequency. Typically a TDC uses a crystal oscillator reference frequency for good long term stability. High stability crystal oscillators are usually relative low frequency such as 10 MHz (or 100 ns resolution).For example, a Hewlett-Packard (now Agilent) 10811 crystal oven oscillator; http://www.hparchive.com/Manuals/HP-10811AB-Manual.pdf To get better resolution, a phase-locked loop frequency multiplier can be used to generate a faster clock. One might, for example, multiply the crystal reference oscillator by 100 to get a clock rate of 1 GHz (1 ns resolution). =Counter technology= High clock rates impose additional design constraints on the counter: if the clock period is short, it is difficult to update the count. Binary counters, for example, need a fast carry architecture because they essentially add one to the previous counter value. A solution is using a hybrid counter architecture. A Johnson counter, for example, is a fast non- binary counter. It can be used to count very quickly the low order count; a more conventional binary counter can be used to accumulate the high order count. The fast counter is sometime called a prescaler. The speed of counters fabricated in CMOS-technology is limited by the capacitance between the gate and the channel and by the resistance of the channel and the signal traces. The product of both is the cut-off-frequency. Modern chip technology allows multiple metal layers and therefore coils with a large number of windings to be inserted into the chip. This allows designers to peak the device for a specific frequency, which may lie above the cut-off-frequency of the original transistor. A peaked variant of the Johnson counter is the traveling-wave counter which also achieves sub-cycle resolution. Other methods to achieve sub-cycle resolution include analog-to-digital converters and vernier Johnson counters. =Measuring a time interval= sketch of the coarse counting method in TDCs: showing measurements of T in various relations to the clock pulses In most situations, the user does not want to just capture an arbitrary time that an event occurs, but wants to measure a time interval, the time between a start event and a stop event. That can be done by measuring an arbitrary time both the start and stop events and subtracting. The measurement can be off by two counts. The subtraction can be avoided if the counter is held at zero until the start event, counts during the interval, and then stops counting after the stop event. Coarse counters base on a reference clock with signals generated at a stable frequency f_0. When the start signal is detected the counter starts counting clock signals and terminates counting after the stop signal is detected. The time interval T between start and stop is then : T = n\\\\cdot T_0 with n, the number of counts and T_0 = 1/f_0, the period of the reference clock. Statistical counter Since start, stop and clock signal are asynchronous, there is a uniform probability distribution of the start and stop signal-times between two subsequent clock pulses. This detuning of the start and stop signal from the clock pulses is called quantization error. For a series of measurements on the same constant and asynchronous time interval one measures two different numbers of counted clock pulses n_1 and n_2 (see picture). These occur with probabilities : p(n_1) = 1 - c :q(n_2) = c with c = Frc(T/T_0) the fractional part of T/T_0. The value for the time interval is then obtained by :T = (p\\\\cdot n_1 + q\\\\cdot n_2)\\\\cdot T_0 Measuring a time interval using a coarse counter with the averaging method described above is relatively time consuming because of the many repetitions that are needed to determine the probabilities p and q. In comparison to the other methods described later on, a coarse counter has a very limited resolution (1ns in case of a 1 GHz reference clock), but satisfies with its theoretically unlimited measuring range. Fine measurement In contrast to the coarse counter in the previous section, fine measurement methods with much better accuracy but far smaller measuring range are presented here. Analogue methods like time interval stretching or double conversion as well as digital methods like tapped delay lines and the Vernier method are under examination. Though the analogue methods still obtain better accuracies, digital time interval measurement is often preferred due to its flexibility in integrated circuit technology and its robustness against external perturbations like temperature changes. The counter implementation's accuracy is limited by the clock frequency. If time is measured by whole counts, then the resolution is limited to the clock period. For example, a 10 MHz clock has a resolution of 100 ns. To get resolution finer than a clock period, there are time interpolation circuits., entry for time interval counter. These circuits measure the fraction of a clock period: that is, the time between a clock event and the event being measured. The interpolation circuits often require a significant amount of time to perform their function; consequently, the TDC needs a quiet interval before the next measurement. Ramp interpolator When counting is not feasible because the clock rate would be too high, analog methods can be used. Analog methods are often used to measure intervals that are between 10 and 200 ns. These methods often use a capacitor that is charged during the interval being measured. Initially, the capacitor is discharged to zero volts. When the start event occurs, the capacitor is charged with a constant current I1; the constant current causes the voltage v on the capacitor to increase linearly with time. The rising voltage is called the fast ramp. When the stop event occurs, the charging current is stopped. The voltage on the capacitor v is directly proportional to the time interval T and can be measured with an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The resolution of such a system is in the range of 1 to 10 ps.. Kalisz states that the Stanford Research Systems SR620 uses this method. Although a separate ADC can be used, the ADC step is often integrated into the interpolator. A second constant current I2 is used to discharge the capacitor at a constant but much slower rate (the slow ramp). The slow ramp might be 1/1000 of the fast ramp. This discharge effectively \\"stretches\\" the time interval; stating, \\"Effectively, the interpolator magnifies the interpolation or uncertainty interval by the ratio of the charge and discharge currents.\\" it will take 1000 times as long for the capacitor to discharge to zero volts. The stretched interval can be measured with a counter. The measurement is similar to a dual-slope analog converter. The dual-slope conversion can take a long time: a thousand or so clock ticks in the scheme described above. That limits how often a measurement can be made (dead time). Resolution of 1 ps with a 100 MHz (10 ns) clock requires a stretch ratio of 10,000 and implies a conversion time of 150 Œºs. To decrease the conversion time, the interpolator circuit can be used twice in a residual interpolator technique. The fast ramp is used initially as above to determine the time. The slow ramp is only at 1/100. The slow ramp will cross zero at some time during the clock period. When the ramp crosses zero, the fast ramp is turned on again to measure the crossing time (tresidual). Consequently, the time can be determined to 1 part in 10,000. Interpolators are often used with a stable system clock. The start event is asynchronous, but the stop event is a following clock. For convenience, imagine that the fast ramp rises exactly 1 volt during a 100 ns clock period. Assume the start event occurs at 67.3 ns after a clock pulse; the fast ramp integrator is triggered and starts rising. The asynchronous start event is also routed through a synchronizer that takes at least two clock pulses. By the next clock pulse, the ramp has risen to .327 V. By the second clock pulse, the ramp has risen to 1.327 V and the synchronizer reports the start event has been seen. The fast ramp is stopped and the slow ramp starts. The synchronizer output can be used to capture system time from a counter. After 1327 clocks, the slow ramp returns to its starting point, and interpolator knows that the event occurred 132.7 ns before the synchronizer reported. The interpolator is actually more involved because there are synchronizer issues and current switching is not instantaneous. Also, the interpolator must calibrate the height of the ramp to a clock period. stating, \\"In practice, the current sources and other circuitry used to build the interpolators are subject to operational variations over temperature and time. The 5360A's interpolators were in a special insulated cavity and had several adjustments. The 5335A uses a self-calibration technique that is not affected by temperature and needs no adjustments.\\" Vernier =Vernier interpolator= The vernier method is more involved. The method involves a triggerable oscillator and a coincidence circuit. At the event, the integer clock count is stored and the oscillator is started. The triggered oscillator has a slightly different frequency than the clock oscillator. For sake of argument, say the triggered oscillator has a period that is 1 ns faster than the clock. If the event happened 67 ns after the last clock, then the triggered oscillator transition will slide by ‚àí1 ns after each subsequent clock pulse. The triggered oscillator will be at 66 ns after the next clock, at 65 ns after the second clock, and so forth. A coincidence detector looks for when the triggered oscillator and the clock transition at the same time, and that indicates the fraction time that needs to be added. The interpolator design is more involved. The triggerable clock must be calibrated to clock. It must also start quickly and cleanly. =Vernier method= The Vernier method is a digital version of the time stretching method. Two only slightly detuned oscillators (with frequencies f_1 and f_2) start their signals with the arrival of the start and the stop signal. As soon as the leading edges of the oscillator signals coincide the measurement ends and the number of periods of the oscillators (n_1 and n_2 respectively) lead to the original time interval T: :T = \\\\frac{n_1-1}{f_1} - \\\\frac{n_2-1}{f_2} Since highly reliable oscillators with stable and accurate frequency are still quite a challenge one also realizes the vernier method via two tapped delay lines using two slightly different cell delay times \\\\tau. This setting is called differential delay line or vernier delay line. In the example presented here the first delay line affiliated with the start signal contains cells of D-flip-flops with delay \\\\tau_L which are initially set to transparent. During the transition of the start signal through one of those cells, the signal is delayed by \\\\tau_L and the state of the flip-flop is sampled as transparent. The second delay line belonging to the stop signal is composed of a series of non-inverting buffers with delay \\\\tau_B < \\\\tau_L. Propagating through its channel the stop signal latches the flip-flops of the start signal's delay line. As soon as the stop signal passes the start signal, the latter is stopped and all leftover flip- flops are sampled opaque. Analogous to the above case of the oscillators the wanted time interval T is then :T = n\\\\cdot (\\\\tau_1 - \\\\tau_2) with n the number of cells marked as transparent. Tapped delay line circuit diagram of a tapped delay line In general a tapped delay line contains a number of cells with well defined delay times \\\\tau. Propagating through this line the start signal is delayed. The state of the line is sampled at the time of the arrival of the stop signal. This can be realized for example with a line of D-flip- flop cells with a delay time \\\\tau. The start signal propagates through this line of transparent flip-flops and is delayed by a certain number of them. The output of each flip-flop is sampled on the fly. The stop signal latches all flip-flops while propagating through its channel undelayed and the start signal cannot propagate further. Now the time interval between start and stop signal is proportional to the number of flip-flops that were sampled as transparent. Hybrid measurement Sketch of the Nutt interpolation method Counters can measure long intervals but have limited resolution. Interpolators have high resolution but they cannot measure long intervals. A hybrid approach can achieve both long intervals and high resolution. The long interval can be measured with a counter. The counter information is supplemented with two time interpolators: one interpolator measures the (short) interval between the start event and a following clock event, and the second interpolator measure the interval between the stop event and a following clock event. The basic idea has some complications: the start and stop events are asynchronous, and one or both might happen close to a clock pulse. The counter and interpolators must agree on matching the start and end clock events. To accomplish that goal, synchronizers are used. The common hybrid approach is the Nutt method. In this example the fine measurement circuit measures the time between start and stop pulse and the respective second nearest clock pulse of the coarse counter (Tstart, Tstop), detected by the synchronizer (see figure). Thus the wanted time interval is :T = n T_0 + T_{\\\\mathrm{start}} - T_{\\\\mathrm{stop}} with n the number of counter clock pulses and T0 the period of the coarse counter. History Time measurement has played a crucial role in the understanding of nature from the earliest times. Starting with sun, sand or water driven clocks we are able to use clocks today, based on the most precise caesium resonators. The first direct predecessor of a TDC was invented in the year 1942 by Bruno Rossi for the measurement of muon lifetimes.\\"Bruno Benedetto Rossi\\", George W. Clark, National Academic Press, Washington D.C. 1998, S.13 It was designed as a time-to-amplitude-converter, constantly charging a capacitor during the measured time interval. The corresponding voltage is directly proportional to the time interval under examination. While the basic concepts (like Vernier methods (Pierre Vernier 1584-1638) and time stretching) of dividing time into measurable intervals are still up-to-date, the implementation changed a lot during the past 50 years. Starting with vacuum tubes and ferrite pot-core transformers those ideas are implemented in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) design today.\\"Noise Shaping Techniques for Analog and Time to Digital Converters Using Voltage Controlled Oscillators\\", Matthew A.Z. Straayer, Phd-Thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2008) Errors :Some information from Regarding even the fine measuring methods presented, there are still errors one may wish remove or at least to consider. Non-linearities of the time-to-digital conversion for example can be identified by taking a large number of measurements of a poissonian distributed source (statistical code density test). Small deviations from the uniform distribution reveal the non-linearities. Inconveniently the statistical code density method is quite sensitive to external temperature changes. Thus stabilizing delay or phase-locked loop (DLL or PLL) circuits are recommended. In a similar way, offset errors (non-zero readouts at T = 0) can be removed. For long time intervals, the error due to instabilities in the reference clock (jitter) plays a major role. Thus clocks of superior quality are needed for such TDCs. Furthermore, external noise sources can be eliminated in postprocessing by robust estimation methods. Configurations TDCs are currently built as stand-alone measuring devices in physical experiments or as system components like PCI cards. They can be made up of either discrete or integrated circuits. Circuit design changes with the purpose of the TDC, which can either be a very good solution for single- shot TDCs with long dead times or some trade-off between dead-time and resolution for multi-shot TDCs. Delay generator Similarity between a TDC (bottom) and a Delay Generator (top, but needs bottom for trigger). The strobe is gated by the oscillator to avoid a race with the carry bit The time-to- digital converter measures the time between a start event and a stop event. There is also a digital-to-time converter or delay generator. The delay generator converts a number to a time delay. When the delay generator gets a start pulse at its input, then it outputs a stop pulse after the specified delay. The architectures for TDC and delay generators are similar. Both use counters for long, stable, delays. Both must consider the problem of clock quantization errors. For example, the Tektronix 7D11 Digital Delay uses a counter architecture. A digital delay may be set from 100 ns to 1 s in 100 ns increments. An analog circuit provides an additional fine delay of 0 to 100 ns. A 5 MHz reference clock drives a phase-locked loop to produce a stable 500 MHz clock. It is this fast clock that is gated by the (fine-delayed) start event and determines the main quantization error. The fast clock is divided down to 10 MHz and fed to main counter.Ten megahertz is a frequency that TTL logic in 1971 could handle. The high frequency divisions were handled with different technologies because high speed digital counters were uncommon in 1971. The first (500 MHz) divider stage is a 100 MHz synchronized multivibrator to effect a divide by 5 circuit. The second (100 MHz) stage is a divide by 5 ring counter made from discrete emitter-coupled transistors. The last stage is a flip-flop. The instrument quantization error depends primarily on the 500 MHz clock (2 ns steps), but other errors also enter; the instrument is specified to have 2.2 ns of jitter. The recycle time is 575 ns. Just as a TDC may use interpolation to get finer than one clock period resolution, a delay generator may use similar techniques. The Hewlett-Packard 5359A High Resolution Time Synthesizer provides delays of 0 to 160 ms, has an accuracy of 1 ns, and achieves a typical jitter of 100 ps. The design uses a triggered phase-locked oscillator that runs at 200 MHz. Interpolation is done with a ramp, an 8-bit digital-to-analog converter, and a comparator. The resolution is about 45 ps. When the start pulse is received, then counts down and outputs a stop pulse. For low jitter the synchronous counter has to feed a zero flag from the most significant bit down to the least significant bit and then combine it with the output from the Johnson counter. A digital-to-analog converter (DAC) could be used to achieve sub-cycle resolution, but it is easier to either use vernier Johnson counters or traveling-wave Johnson counters. The delay generator can be used for pulse width modulation, e.g. to drive a MOSFET to load a Pockels cell within 8 ns with a specific charge. The output of a delay generator can gate a digital-to-analog converter and so pulses of a variable height can be generated. This allows matching to low levels needed by analog electronics, higher levels for ECL and even higher levels for TTL. If a series of DACs is gated in sequence, variable pulse shapes can be generated to account for any transfer function.

Background  The Liberal Party had suffered the worst defeat in its history in the 1984 election. In the first years of the Mulroney government, the Liberals failed to mount an effective opposition to Mulroney, and were in danger of being overshadowed by the New Democratic Party (NDP), which had almost as many seats as the Liberals. In the midst of this, a group of young, energetic, and unknown Liberals soon emerged as a vocal voice of opposition to Mulroney. They included Don Boudria of eastern Ontario, Sheila Copps of Hamilton, Brian Tobin of Newfoundland and John Nunziata of the Greater Toronto Area. Tobin had been elected when the Liberals regained power in the 1980 election; the others had been among the few bright spots for the Liberals in the 1984 blowout. Except for Nunziata and Boudria, who held some socially conservative views, all of them came from the left wing of the Liberal Party. The Globe and Mail suggested the name \\"Rat Pack\\" was originally given by \\"a newspaper reporter.\\" They played a role in ending the career of a number of Mulroney ministers due to their vocal criticism. Boudria, Tobin, and Copps were all appointed to Cabinet at various times during the ministry of Jean Chr√©tien.John Nunziata Nunziata was expelled from the Liberal Party in 1996 for voting against the budget. He then ran‚Äîand won‚Äîas an independent candidate in the 1997 federal election and then was defeated by a Liberal in 2000. Tobin left Parliament in 1996 to become leader of the Newfoundland Liberal Party; he served as that province's premier until returning to Parliament in 2000. Under the somewhat more right-of-centre Paul Martin, who succeeded Chr√©tien in 2003, Copps and Boudria were relegated to the Liberal backbenches. Tobin had already left Parliament in 2002 in protest of the stranglehold on the Liberal organization by Martin's supporters. In 2004, Copps' riding was merged with that of Martin loyalist Tony Valeri in such a way that most of the new riding's residents lived in Valeri's old riding. Copps was narrowly defeated for renomination. The last remaining member of the group, Boudria, did not run for reelection in 2006. References * \\"Liberals' Rat Pack aims for credibility\\".

As a result, higher levels of 17Œ±-hydroxypregnenolone appear in the blood with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge, which stimulates adrenal corticosteroid synthesis. There is a wide spectrum of clinical presentations of 3Œ≤-HSD CAH, from mild to severe forms. The uncommon severe form results from a complete loss of enzymatic activity and manifests itself in infancy as salt wasting due to the loss of mineralocorticoids. Milder forms resulting from incomplete loss of 3Œ≤-HSD type II function do not present with adrenal crisis, but can still produce virilization of genetically female infants and undervirilization of genetically male infants. As a result, this form of primary hypoadrenalism is the only form of CAH that can cause ambiguous genitalia in both genetic sexes. Signs and symptoms Pathophysiology 3Œ≤-HSD II mediates three parallel dehydrogenase/isomerase reactions in the adrenals that convert Œî4 to Œî5 steroids: pregnenolone to progesterone, 17Œ±-hydroxypregnenolone to 17Œ±-hydroxyprogesterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) to androstenedione. 3Œ≤-HSD II also mediates an alternate route of testosterone synthesis from androstenediol in the testes. 3Œ≤-HSD deficiency results in large elevations of pregnenolone, 17Œ±-hydroxypregnenolone, and DHEA. However, complexity arises from the presence of a second 3Œ≤-HSD isoform (HSD3B1) coded by a different gene, expressed in the liver and placenta, and unaffected in 3Œ≤-HSD-deficient CAH. The presence of this second enzyme has two clinical consequences. First, 3Œ≤-HSD II can convert enough of the excess 17Œ±-hydroxypregnenolone to 17Œ±-hydroxyprogesterone to produce 17Œ±-hydroxyprogesterone levels suggestive of common 21-hydroxylase deficient CAH. Measurement of the other affected steroids distinguishes the two. Second, 3Œ≤-HSD I can convert enough DHEA to testosterone to moderately virilize a genetically female fetus. Mineralocorticoids The mineralocorticoid aspect of severe 3Œ≤-HSD CAH is similar to those of 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Like other enzymes involved in early stages of both aldosterone and cortisol synthesis, the severe form of 3Œ≤-HSD deficiency can result in life-threatening salt-wasting in early infancy. Salt-wasting is managed acutely with saline and high-dose hydrocortisone, and long-term fludrocortisone. Sex steroid The sex steroid consequences of severe 3Œ≤-HSD CAH are unique among the congenital adrenal hyperplasias: it is the only form of CAH that can produce ambiguity in both sexes. As with 21-hydroxylase-deficient CAH, the degree of severity can determine the magnitude of over- or undervirilization. In an XX (genetically female) fetus, elevated amounts of DHEA can produce moderate virilization by conversion in the liver to testosterone. Virilization of genetic females is partial, often mild, and rarely raises assignment questions. The issues surrounding corrective surgery of the virilized female genitalia are the same as for moderate 21-hydroxylase deficiency but surgery is rarely considered desirable. The extent to which mild 3Œ≤-HSD CAH can cause early appearance of pubic hair and other aspects of hyperandrogenism in later childhood or adolescence is unsettled. Early reports about 20 years ago suggesting that mild forms of 3Œ≤-HSD CAH comprised significant proportions of girls with premature pubic hair or older women with hirsutism have not been confirmed and it now appears that premature pubarche in childhood and hirsutism after adolescence are not common manifestations of 3Œ≤-HSD CAH. Undervirilization of genetic males with 3Œ≤-HSD CAH occurs because synthesis of testosterone is impaired in both adrenals and testes. Although DHEA is elevated, it is a weak androgen and too little testosterone is produced in the liver to offset the deficiency of testicular testosterone. The degree of undervirilization is more variable, from mild to severe. Management issues are those of an undervirilized male with normal sensitivity to testosterone. If the infant boy is only mildly undervirilized, the hypospadias can be surgically repaired, testes brought into the scrotum, and testosterone supplied at puberty. Management decisions are more difficult for a moderately or severely undervirilized genetic male whose testes are in the abdomen and whose genitalia look at least as much female as male. Male sex can assigned and major reconstructive surgery done to close the midline of the perineum and move the testes into a constructed scrotum. Female sex can be assigned and the testes removed and vagina enlarged surgically. A recently advocated third choice would be to assign either sex and defer surgery to adolescence. Each approach carries its own disadvantages and risks. Children and their families are different enough that none of the courses is appropriate for all. Diagnosis Like the other forms of CAH, suspicion of severe 3Œ≤-HSD CAH is usually raised by the appearance of the genitalia at birth or by development of a salt-wasting crisis in the first month of life. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by the distinctive pattern of adrenal steroids: elevated pregnenolone, 17Œ±-hydroxypregnenolone, DHEA, and renin. In clinical circumstances this form of CAH has sometimes been difficult to distinguish from the more common 21-hydroxylase deficient CAH because of the 17Œ±-hydroxypregnenolone elevation, or from simple premature adrenarche because of the DHEA elevation. Management Some of the childhood management issues are similar those of 21-hydroxylase deficiency: * Replacing mineralocorticoid with fludrocortisone * Suppressing DHEA and replacing cortisol with glucocorticoid * Providing extra glucocorticoid for stress * Close monitoring and perhaps other adjunctive measures to optimize growth * Deciding whether surgical repair of virilized female genitalia is warranted However, unlike 21-hydroxylase CAH, children with 3Œ≤-HSD CAH may be unable to produce adequate amounts of testosterone (boys) or estradiol (girls) to effect normal pubertal changes. Replacement testosterone or estrogen and progesterone can be initiated at adolescence and continued throughout adult life. Fertility may be impaired by the difficulty of providing appropriate sex hormone levels in the gonads even though the basic anatomy is present.

Overview Released in 1993, RenderWare is a 3D API and graphics rendering engine used in video games, Active Worlds, and some VRML browsers. RenderWare was developed by Criterion Software Limited, which used to be a wholly owned subsidiary of Canon but is now owned by Electronic Arts. It originated in the era of software rendering on CPUs prior to the appearance of GPUs, competing with other libraries such as Argonaut Games's BRender and RenderMorphics' Reality Lab (the latter was acquired by Microsoft and became Direct3D). RenderWare's principal commercial importance was in providing an off-the-shelf solution to the difficulties of PS2 graphics programming. It was almost describable as \\"Sony's DirectX\\" during this era--although the name refers to surrounding framework and toolchain middleware. Prior to version 2, an external programming or scripting language was required to take advantage of RenderWare. RenderWare 2, on the other hand, has its own internal scripting language: RWX (RenderWare script). However, in RenderWare 3 RWX support was removed. This next iteration focused on a binary model file format. As with the previous version increment, Criterion removed support for RenderWare 3's formats in RenderWare 4. RenderWare is cross-platform: it runs on Windows as well as Apple Mac OS X-based applications and many video game consoles such as GameCube, Wii, Xbox, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation Portable. RenderWare is no longer available for purchase, although EA still honors old contracts, meaning that external developers who licensed the technology before the Criterion acquisition may still use the software. What was RenderWare 4 has dissolved into the rest of EA internal tech. Bing Gordon, an EA executive, has stated that RenderWare did not perform well enough for next-gen hardware, graphics wise, and that RenderWare did not stand up to competition, such as Unreal Engine from Epic Games. He has also stated that the RenderWare team is \\"mostly a dev house\\" (indicating that EA is reluctant still to use RenderWare).Gamasutra interview with Bing Gordon See also *List of RenderWare games References External links Historical and technical insight of RenderWare at SIGMA'Co *Criterion Games *RenderWare V2.1 API Reference 3D scenegraph APIs Video game engines Virtual reality ","title":"RenderWare"},{"id":"715911","text":"A nanny is a child's caregiver.

A common sign of a bite from a venomous snake is the presence of two puncture wounds from the animal's fangs. Sometimes venom injection from the bite may occur. This may result in redness, swelling, and severe pain at the area, which may take up to an hour to appear. Vomiting, blurred vision, tingling of the limbs, and sweating may result. Most bites are on the hands, arms, or legs. Fear following a bite is common with symptoms of a racing heart and feeling faint. The venom may cause bleeding, kidney failure, a severe allergic reaction, tissue death around the bite, or breathing problems. Bites may result in the loss of a limb or other chronic problems. The outcome depends on the type of snake, the area of the body bitten, the amount of venom injected, and the general health of the person bitten. Problems are often more severe in children than adults, due to their smaller size. Snakes administer bites, both as a method of hunting, and as a means of protection. Risk factors for bites include working outside with one's hands such as in farming, forestry, and construction. Snakes commonly involved in poisonings include elapids (such as kraits, cobras and mambas), vipers, and sea snakes. The majority of snake species do not have venom and kill their prey by squeezing them. Venomous snakes can be found on every continent except Antarctica. Determining the type of snake that caused a bite is often not possible. The World Health Organization says snakebites are a \\"neglected public health issue in many tropical and subtropical countries\\", and in 2017, WHO categorized snakebite envenomation as a Neglected Tropical Disease (Category A). The purpose was to encourage research, expand accessibility of antivenoms, and improve snakebite management in \\"developing countries\\". Prevention of snake bites can involve wearing protective footwear, avoiding areas where snakes live, and not handling snakes. Treatment partly depends on the type of snake. Washing the wound with soap and water and holding the limb still is recommended. Trying to suck out the venom, cutting the wound with a knife, or using a tourniquet is not recommended. Antivenom is effective at preventing death from bites; however, antivenoms frequently have side effects. The type of antivenom needed depends on the type of snake involved. When the type of snake is unknown, antivenom is often given based on the types known to be in the area. In some areas of the world getting the right type of antivenom is difficult and this partly contributes to why they sometimes do not work. An additional issue is the cost of these medications. Antivenom has little effect on the area around the bite itself. Supporting the person's breathing is sometimes also required. The number of venomous snakebites that occur each year may be as high as five million. They result in about 2.5 million poisonings and 20,000 to 125,000 deaths. The frequency and severity of bites vary greatly among different parts of the world. They occur most commonly in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, with rural areas more greatly affected. Deaths are relatively rare in Australia, Europe and North America. For example, in the United States, about seven to eight thousand people per year are bitten by venomous snakes (about one in 40 thousand people) and about five people die (about one death per 65 million people).

Retrieved on 19 mars, 2009 The most common first symptom of all snakebites is an overwhelming fear, which may contribute to other symptoms, and may include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, vertigo, fainting, tachycardia, and cold, clammy skin. Television, literature, and folklore may contribute to the fear surrounding snakebites, causing people to experience unwarranted thoughts of imminent death. Dry snakebites and those inflicted by a non- venomous species may still cause severe injury. The bite may become infected from the snake's saliva. The fangs sometimes harbor pathogenic microbial organisms, including Clostridium tetani. Infection is often reported from the bites of vipers, whose fangs are capable of deep puncture wounds, which may introduce infectious organisms into the tissue. Venom may cause anaphylaxis in certain people. Most snakebites, from either a venomous or a non-venomous snake, will have some type of local effect. Minor pain and redness occur in over 90 percent of cases, although this varies depending on the site. Bites by vipers and some cobras may be extremely painful, with the local tissue sometimes becoming tender and severely swollen within five minutes. This area may also bleed and blister, and may lead to tissue necrosis. Other common initial symptoms of pit viper and viper bites include lethargy, bleeding, weakness, nausea, and vomiting. Symptoms may become more life-threatening over time, developing into hypotension, tachypnea, severe tachycardia, severe internal bleeding, altered sensorium, kidney failure, and respiratory failure. Bites by some snakes, such as the kraits, coral snake, Mojave rattlesnake, and the speckled rattlesnake, may cause little or no pain, despite their serious and potentially life-threatening venom. Some people report experiencing a \\"rubbery\\", \\"minty\\", or \\"metallic\\" taste after being bitten by certain species of rattlesnake. Spitting cobras and rinkhalses can spit venom in a person's eyes. This results in immediate pain, ophthalmoparesis, and sometimes blindness. Severe tissue necrosis following Bothrops asper envenomation that required amputation above the knee. The person was an 11-year-old boy, bitten two weeks earlier in Ecuador, but treated only with antibiotics. Some Australian elapids and most viper envenomations will cause coagulopathy, sometimes so severe that a person may bleed spontaneously from the mouth, nose, and even old, seemingly healed wounds. Internal organs may bleed, including the brain and intestines, and ecchymosis (bruising) of the skin is often seen. The venom of elapids, including sea snakes, kraits, cobras, king cobra, mambas, and many Australian species, contains toxins which attack the nervous system, causing neurotoxicity. The person may present with strange disturbances to their vision, including blurriness. Paresthesia throughout the body, as well as difficulty in speaking and breathing, may be reported. Nervous system problems will cause a huge array of symptoms, and those provided here are not exhaustive. If not treated immediately they may die from respiratory failure. Venom emitted from some types of cobras, almost all vipers and some sea snakes causes necrosis of muscle tissue. Muscle tissue will begin to die throughout the body, a condition known as rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdomyolysis can result in damage to the kidneys as a result of myoglobin accumulation in the renal tubules. This, coupled with hypotension, can lead to acute kidney injury, and, if left untreated, eventually death.  Cause  In the developing world most snakebites occur in those who work outside such as farmers, hunters, and fishermen. They often happen when a person steps on the snake or approaches it too closely. In the United States and Europe snakebites most commonly occur in those who keep them as pets. The type of snake that most often delivers serious bites depends on the region of the world. In Africa, it is mambas, Egyptian cobras, puff adders, and carpet vipers. In the Middle East, it is carpet vipers and elapids. In Latin America, it is snakes of the Bothrops and Crotalus types, the latter including rattlesnakes. In North America, rattlesnakes are the primary concern, and up to 95% of all snakebite-related deaths in the United States are attributed to the western and eastern diamondback rattlesnakes. In South Asia, it was previously believed that Indian cobras, common kraits, Russell's viper, and carpet vipers were the most dangerous; other snakes, however, may also cause significant problems in this area of the world.  Pathophysiology  Since envenomation is completely voluntary, all venomous snakes are capable of biting without injecting venom into a person. Snakes may deliver such a \\"dry bite\\" rather than waste their venom on a creature too large for them to eat, a behaviour called venom metering. However, the percentage of dry bites varies among species: 80 percent of bites inflicted by sea snakes, which are normally timid, do not result in envenomation, whereas only 25 percent of pit viper bites are dry. Furthermore, some snake genera, such as rattlesnakes, significantly increase the amount of venom injected in defensive bites compared to predatory strikes. Some dry bites may also be the result of imprecise timing on the snake's part, as venom may be prematurely released before the fangs have penetrated the person. Even without venom, some snakes, particularly large constrictors such as those belonging to the Boidae and Pythonidae families, can deliver damaging bites; large specimens often cause severe lacerations, or the snake itself pulls away, causing the flesh to be torn by the needle-sharp recurved teeth embedded in the person. While not as life-threatening as a bite from a venomous species, the bite can be at least temporarily debilitating and could lead to dangerous infections if improperly dealt with. While most snakes must open their mouths before biting, African and Middle Eastern snakes belonging to the family Atractaspididae are able to fold their fangs to the side of their head without opening their mouth and jab a person.  Snake venom  It has been suggested that snakes evolved the mechanisms necessary for venom formation and delivery sometime during the Miocene epoch. During the mid-Tertiary, most snakes were large ambush predators belonging to the superfamily Henophidia, which use constriction to kill their prey. As open grasslands replaced forested areas in parts of the world, some snake families evolved to become smaller and thus more agile. However, subduing and killing prey became more difficult for the smaller snakes, leading to the evolution of snake venom. Other research on Toxicofera, a hypothetical clade thought to be ancestral to most living reptiles, suggests an earlier time frame for the evolution of snake venom, possibly to the order of tens of millions of years, during the Late Cretaceous. Snake venom is produced in modified parotid glands normally responsible for secreting saliva. It is stored in structures called alveoli behind the animal's eyes, and ejected voluntarily through its hollow tubular fangs. Venom is composed of hundreds to thousands of different proteins and enzymes, all serving a variety of purposes, such as interfering with a prey's cardiac system or increasing tissue permeability so that venom is absorbed faster. Venom in many snakes, such as pit vipers, affects virtually every organ system in the human body and can be a combination of many toxins, including cytotoxins, hemotoxins, neurotoxins, and myotoxins, allowing for an enormous variety of symptoms. Earlier, the venom of a particular snake was considered to be one kind only, i.e. either hemotoxic or neurotoxic, and this erroneous belief may still persist wherever the updated literature is hard to access. Although there is much known about the protein compositions of venoms from Asian and American snakes, comparatively little is known of Australian snakes. The strength of venom differs markedly between species and even more so between families, as measured by median lethal dose (LD50) in mice. Subcutaneous LD50 varies by over 140-fold within elapids and by more than 100-fold in vipers. The amount of venom produced also differs among species, with the Gaboon viper able to potentially deliver from 450‚Äì600 milligrams of venom in a single bite, the most of any snake. Opisthoglyphous colubrids have venom ranging from life- threatening (in the case of the boomslang) to barely noticeable (as in Tantilla).  Prevention  Sign at Sylvan Rodriguez Park in Houston, Texas, warning of the presence of snakes. Snakes are most likely to bite when they feel threatened, are startled, are provoked, or when they have been cornered. Snakes are likely to approach residential areas when attracted by prey, such as rodents. Regular pest control can reduce the threat of snakes considerably. It is beneficial to know the species of snake that are common in local areas, or while travelling or hiking. Africa, Australia, the Neotropics, and southern Asia in particular are populated by many dangerous species of snake. Being aware of‚Äîand ultimately avoiding‚Äîareas known to be heavily populated by dangerous snakes is strongly recommended. When in the wilderness, treading heavily creates ground vibrations and noise, which will often cause snakes to flee from the area. However, this generally only applies to vipers, as some larger and more aggressive snakes in other parts of the world, such as mambas and cobras, will respond more aggressively. If presented with a direct encounter, it is best to remain silent and motionless. If the snake has not yet fled, it is important to step away slowly and cautiously. The use of a flashlight when engaged in camping activities, such as gathering firewood at night, can be helpful. Snakes may also be unusually active during especially warm nights when ambient temperatures exceed . It is advised not to reach blindly into hollow logs, flip over large rocks, and enter old cabins or other potential snake hiding-places. When rock climbing, it is not safe to grab ledges or crevices without examining them first, as snakes are cold-blooded and often sunbathe atop rock ledges. In the United States, more than 40 percent of people bitten by snake intentionally put themselves in harm's way by attempting to capture wild snakes or by carelessly handling their dangerous pets‚Äî40 percent of that number had a blood alcohol level of 0.1 percent or more. It is also important to avoid snakes that appear to be dead, as some species will actually roll over on their backs and stick out their tongue to fool potential threats. A snake's detached head can immediately act by reflex and potentially bite. The induced bite can be just as severe as that of a live snake. As a dead snake is incapable of regulating the venom injected, a bite from a dead snake can often contain large amounts of venom.  Treatment  It may be difficult to determine if a bite by any species of snake is life- threatening. A bite by a North American copperhead on the ankle is usually a moderate injury to a healthy adult, but a bite to a child's abdomen or face by the same snake may be fatal. The outcome of all snakebites depends on a multitude of factors: the type of snake, the size, physical condition, and temperature of the snake, the age and physical condition of the person, the area and tissue bitten (e.g., foot, torso, vein or muscle), the amount of venom injected, the time it takes for the person to find treatment, and finally the quality of that treatment.  Snake identification  Identification of the snake is important in planning treatment in certain areas of the world, but is not always possible. Ideally the dead snake would be brought in with the person, but in areas where snake bite is more common, local knowledge may be sufficient to recognize the snake. However, in regions where polyvalent antivenoms are available, such as North America, identification of snake is not a high priority item. Attempting to catch or kill the offending snake also puts one at risk for re-envenomation or creating a second person bitten, and generally is not recommended. The three types of venomous snakes that cause the majority of major clinical problems are vipers, kraits, and cobras. Knowledge of what species are present locally can be crucial, as is knowledge of typical signs and symptoms of envenomation by each type of snake. A scoring system can be used to try to determine the biting snake based on clinical features, but these scoring systems are extremely specific to particular geographical areas.  First aid  Snakebite first aid recommendations vary, in part because different snakes have different types of venom. Some have little local effect, but life-threatening systemic effects, in which case containing the venom in the region of the bite by pressure immobilization is desirable. Other venoms instigate localized tissue damage around the bitten area, and immobilization may increase the severity of the damage in this area, but also reduce the total area affected; whether this trade-off is desirable remains a point of controversy. Because snakes vary from one country to another, first aid methods also vary. Many organizations, including the American Medical Association and American Red Cross, recommend washing the bite with soap and water. Australian recommendations for snake bite treatment recommend against cleaning the wound. Traces of venom left on the skin/bandages from the strike can be used in combination with a snake bite identification kit to identify the species of snake. This speeds determination of which antivenom to administer in the emergency room.  Pressure immobilization  A Russell's viper is being \\"milked\\". Laboratories use extracted snake venom to produce antivenom, which is often the only effective treatment for potentially fatal snakebites. As of 2008, clinical evidence for pressure immobilization via the use of an elastic bandage is limited. It is recommended for snakebites that have occurred in Australia (due to elapids which are neurotoxic). It is not recommended for bites from non-neurotoxic snakes such as those found in North America and other regions of the world. The British military recommends pressure immobilization in all cases where the type of snake is unknown. The object of pressure immobilization is to contain venom within a bitten limb and prevent it from moving through the lymphatic system to the vital organs. This therapy has two components: pressure to prevent lymphatic drainage, and immobilization of the bitten limb to prevent the pumping action of the skeletal muscles.  Antivenom  Until the advent of antivenom, bites from some species of snake were almost universally fatal. Despite huge advances in emergency therapy, antivenom is often still the only effective treatment for envenomation. The first antivenom was developed in 1895 by French physician Albert Calmette for the treatment of Indian cobra bites. Antivenom is made by injecting a small amount of venom into an animal (usually a horse or sheep) to initiate an immune system response. The resulting antibodies are then harvested from the animal's blood. Antivenom is injected into the person intravenously, and works by binding to and neutralizing venom enzymes. It cannot undo damage already caused by venom, so antivenom treatment should be sought as soon as possible. Modern antivenoms are usually polyvalent, making them effective against the venom of numerous snake species. Pharmaceutical companies which produce antivenom target their products against the species native to a particular area. Although some people may develop serious adverse reactions to antivenom, such as anaphylaxis, in emergency situations this is usually treatable and hence the benefit outweighs the potential consequences of not using antivenom. Giving adrenaline (epinephrine) to prevent adverse reactions to antivenom before they occur might be reasonable in cases where they occur commonly. Antihistamines do not appear to provide any benefit in preventing adverse reactions.  Outmoded  Old-style snake bite kit that should not be used. The following treatments, while once recommended, are considered of no use or harmful, including tourniquets, incisions, suction, application of cold, and application of electricity. Cases in which these treatments appear to work may be the result of dry bites. * Application of a tourniquet to the bitten limb is generally not recommended. There is no convincing evidence that it is an effective first-aid tool as ordinarily applied. Tourniquets have been found to be completely ineffective in the treatment of Crotalus durissus bites, but some positive results have been seen with properly applied tourniquets for cobra venom in the Philippines. Uninformed tourniquet use is dangerous, since reducing or cutting off circulation can lead to gangrene, which can be fatal. The use of a compression bandage is generally as effective, and much safer. * Cutting open the bitten area, an action often taken prior to suction, is not recommended since it causes further damage and increases the risk of infection; the subsequent cauterization of the area with fire or silver nitrate (also known as infernal stone) is also potentially threatening. * Sucking out venom, either by mouth or with a pump, does not work and may harm the affected area directly. Suction started after three minutes removes a clinically insignificant quantity‚Äîless than one-thousandth of the venom injected‚Äîas shown in a human study. In a study with pigs, suction not only caused no improvement but led to necrosis in the suctioned area. Suctioning by mouth presents a risk of further poisoning through the mouth's mucous tissues.Riggs BS, Smilkstein MJ, Kulig KW, et al. Rattlesnake envenomation with massive oropharyngeal edema following incision and suction (Abstract). Presented at the AACT/AAPCC/ABMT/CAPCC Annual Scientific Meeting, Vancouver, Canada, September 27 October 2, 1987. The helper may also release bacteria into the person's wound, leading to infection. * Immersion in warm water or sour milk, followed by the application of snake-stones (also known as la Pierre Noire), which are believed to draw off the poison in much the way a sponge soaks up water. * Application of a one-percent solution of potassium permanganate or chromic acid to the cut, exposed area. The latter substance is notably toxic and carcinogenic. * Drinking abundant quantities of alcohol following the cauterization or disinfection of the wound area. * Use of electroshock therapy in animal tests has shown this treatment to be useless and potentially dangerous. In extreme cases, in remote areas, all of these misguided attempts at treatment have resulted in injuries far worse than an otherwise mild to moderate snakebite. In worst-case scenarios, thoroughly constricting tourniquets have been applied to bitten limbs, completely shutting off blood flow to the area. By the time the person finally reached appropriate medical facilities their limbs had to be amputated.  Epidemiology  Estimates vary from 1.2 to 5.5 million snakebites, 421,000 to 2.5 million envenomings, and 20,000 to 125,000 deaths. Since reporting is not mandatory in much of the world, the data on the frequency of snakebites is not precise. Many people who survive bites have permanent tissue damage caused by venom, leading to disability. Most snake envenomings and fatalities occur in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa, with India reporting the most snakebite deaths of any country. Most snakebites are caused by non- venomous snakes. Of the roughly 3,000 known species of snake found worldwide, only 15% are considered dangerous to humans. Snakes are found on every continent except Antarctica. The most diverse and widely distributed snake family, the colubrids, has approximately 700 venomous species, but only five genera‚Äîboomslangs, twig snakes, keelback snakes, green snakes, and slender snakes‚Äîhave caused human fatalities. Worldwide, snakebites occur most frequently in the summer season when snakes are active and humans are outdoors. Agricultural and tropical regions report more snakebites than anywhere else. In the United States, those bitten are typically male and between 17 and 27 years of age. Children and the elderly are the most likely to die.  Society and culture  Cleopatra VII famously committed suicide by snakebite to her left breast, as depicted in this 1911 painting by Hungarian artist Gyula Bencz√∫r. Snakes were both revered and worshipped and feared by early civilizations. The ancient Egyptians recorded prescribed treatments for snakebites as early as the Thirteenth Dynasty in the Brooklyn Papyrus, which includes at least seven venomous species common to the region today, such as the horned vipers. In Judaism, the Nehushtan was a pole with a snake made of copper fixed upon it. The object was regarded as a divinely empowered instrument of God that could bring healing to Jews bitten by venomous snakes while they were wandering in the desert after their exodus from Egypt. Healing was said to occur by merely looking at the object as it was held up by Moses. Historically, snakebites were seen as a means of execution in some cultures. In medieval Europe, a form of capital punishment was to throw people into snake pits, leaving people to die from multiple venomous bites. A similar form of punishment was common in Southern Han during China's Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period and in India. Snakebites were also used as a form of suicide, most notably by Egyptian queen Cleopatra VII, who reportedly died from the bite of an asp‚Äîlikely an Egyptian cobra‚Äîafter hearing of Mark Antony's death. Snakebite as a surreptitious form of murder has been featured in stories such as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Adventure of the Speckled Band, but actual occurrences are virtually unheard of, with only a few documented cases. It has been suggested that Boris III of Bulgaria, who was allied to Nazi Germany during World War II, may have been killed with snake venom, although there is no definitive evidence. At least one attempted suicide by snakebite has been documented in medical literature involving a puff adder bite to the hand. Research In 2018, the World Health Organization listed snakebite envenoming as a neglected tropical disease. In 2019, they launched a strategy to prevent and control snakebite envenoming, which involved a program targeting affected communities and their health systems.New monoclonal antibodies, polymer gels and a small molecule inhibitor called Varespladib are in development. Other animals Several animals acquired immunity against venom of snakes that occur in the same habitat. This has been documented in some humans as well.

He was part of the unsuccessful attempt in 1585 to colonise Roanoke Island, North Carolina. He also served the Crown in Ireland and was knighted by the Queen in 1593. Early life and education Sir Ralph Lane's origins have not been proven. According to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, he was \\"of unknown parentage and education\\".Oxford University Press. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford University Press It has been theorised that his parents were Sir Ralph Lane of Orlingbury, Hogshaw and Horton, and Maud Parr, a cousin of Catherine Parr, the last queen consort of Henry VIII. However, no evidence has been found to prove this. The Dictionary of National Biography, published in 1909, states he \\"may probably be identified with Ralph, the second son of Sir Ralph Lane (d.1541) of Horton, Northamptonshire, by Maud daughter and coheiress of William Lord Parr of Horton and cousin of Catherine Parr, Henry VIII's last queen. (Collins 1768 iii 164) His seal bore the arms of Lane of Horton (Cal State Papers Ireland 15 March 1598‚Äì9), and the arms assigned him by Burke quarter these with those of Maud Parr (General Armoury). In his correspondence, he speaks of nephews William and Robert Lane (Cal State Papers Ireland 26 Dec 1592, 7 June 1595), of a kinsman John Durrant (ib) and is associated with a Mr Feilding (ib 23 June 1593), all of whom appear in the Lane pedigree (Blore Hist. and Antig. of Rutlandshire p 169). William Feilding married Dorothy Lane, a daughter of Sir Ralph Lane of Horton, and John Durrant was the husband of Catherine, her first cousin.\\" Career Lane was made Member of Parliament for Higham Ferrers in 1556. The choice was surprising, though it may be explained by the connections Lane had in the area, including with the Sheriff of Northamptonshire as well as his London residence, intended to be less costly than if he had served from Higham Ferrers itself. Lane began serving the Crown in 1563 as an equerry under Queen Elizabeth I of England. His duties as an officer of the royal household included law enforcement and collection of customs duties. He served against the northern rebels in 1569, was commissioner of piracy in 1571 and a captain in the Netherlands in 1572‚Äì3. He was elected Member of Parliament for Higham Ferrers in 1558 and for Northampton in 1563. Roanoke colony Lane is best remembered for his attempt to establish a settlement on Roanoke Island at the request of Sir Walter Raleigh. Queen Elizabeth was looking for places to colonise and the Americas appeared ripe for English expansion. The voyage began on 9 April 1585, when Lane set sail from Plymouth with Raleigh's cousin, Sir Richard Grenville, a sailor who upon return to England wrote a book about his findings in the Chesapeake. The fleet comprised the Tiger (Grenville's), the Roebuck, the Red Lion, the Elizabeth, and the Dorothy. The voyage on the Tiger proved difficult, as Lane quarrelled with the aggressive leadership of Grenville, whom he found a person of intolerable pride and insatiable ambition. Unfortunately, during a severe storm off the coast of Portugal, the Tiger was separated from the rest of the fleet. The Tiger arrived on 11 May to Baye's Muskito (Guayanilla, Puerto Rico). While waiting for the other ships, Grenville established relations with the Spanish (whilst at the same time participating in privateering against their ships) and also built a small fortress. The Elizabeth arrived shortly after construction of the fortress. Finally, Grenville grew tired of waiting for the remaining ships and departed on 7 June. The fort was abandoned and its location is now unknown. When the Tiger sailed through the Ocracoke Inlet on 26 June, she ran aground on a sand bank, ruining most of the food supply. The expedition managed to repair the ship, and in early July met the Roebuck and Dorothy, which had come to the Outer Banks a few weeks earlier. The Red Lion had accompanied them, but simply landed its passengers and sailed to Newfoundland for privateering. After an initial exploration of the continental coast and its Indian settlements, Grenville accused the natives of one village Aquascogoc of stealing a silver cup and in retaliation looted and burned the village. Despite this incident and the shortage of food, Lane and 107 other settlers were left on Roanoke Island, Virginia on 17 August 1585 to establish a colony on its north end. They built a small fort, probably similar to the one at Guayanilla Bay, but Lane and Grenville fell out with each other, a foretaste of the troubles that dogged the colony until the end. In the bitter correspondence with London that was to ensue, Lane was described as vain, boastful, and fiery-tempered, brooking little opposition. Almost immediately, Grenville and his crew set sail for England, promising to return in April 1586 with more men and fresh supplies. Contact was quickly made with the local Native Americans. The English treated them with suspicious harshness; on several occasions the colonists kidnapped Indians to extort supplies or extract information. Lane's military background led him to rely more upon arms than diplomacy, and that approach soured his dealings with the natives from the start. April 1586 passed with no news of Grenville. In June, the incident of the stolen cup led to a retaliatory attack against the fort which the settlers were able to repel. Also in June, Sir Francis Drake arrived at Roanoke and offered Lane and his men a return voyage to England, which Lane readily accepted because of a weakened food supply and increased tensions with local tribes. Drake's fleet reached Portsmouth on 28 July, at which the settlers of Roanoke introduced snuff, corn, and potatoes to England. The Account of Ralph Lane first appeared in Richard Hakluyt's Principall Navigations, Voyages, Traffiques and Discoveries of the English Nation in 1589. The Grenville relief fleet arrived shortly after Drake's departure with the settlers. Finding the colony abandoned, Grenville returned to England with the bulk of his force, leaving behind a small detachment to maintain a British presence and protect Raleigh's claim to Virginia. Lane later participated in other expeditions. In January 1592 he was appointed muster-master general of Ireland and was knighted the following year by Sir William FitzWilliam, the Lord Deputy of Ireland. Death In 1594, Lane was severely wounded during an Irish rebellion against the Crown. He never fully recovered and died in 1603 at Dublin, where he was buried in St. Patrick's Cathedral.

Johnson, D-branes, Cambridge University Press, 2003, section 7.1.4. Discovery In 1984, Michael Green and John H. Schwarz realized that the anomaly in type I string theory with the gauge group SO(32) cancels because of an extra \\"classical\\" contribution from a 2-form field. They realized that one of the necessary conditions for a superstring theory to make sense is that the dimension of the gauge group of type I string theory must be 26 and then demonstrated this to be so. In the original calculation, gauge anomalies, mixed anomalies, and gravitational anomalies were expected to arise from a hexagon Feynman diagram. For the special choice of the gauge group SO(32) or E8 x E8, however, the anomaly factorizes and may be cancelled by a tree diagram. In string theory, this indeed occurs. The tree diagram describes the exchange of a virtual quantum of the B-field. It is somewhat counterintuitive to see that a tree diagram cancels a one-loop diagram, but in reality, both of these diagrams arise as one-loop diagrams in superstring theory in which the anomaly cancellation is more transparent. As recounted in The Elegant Universe's TV version, in the second episode, \\"The String's the Thing\\", section \\"Wrestling with String Theory\\", Green describes finding 496 on each side of the equals sign during a stormy night filled with lightning, and fondly recalls joking that \\"the gods are trying to prevent us from completing this calculation\\". Green soon entitled some of his subsequent lectures \\"The Theory of Everything\\". Details Anomalies in quantum theory arise from one-loop diagrams, with a chiral fermion in the loop and gauge fields, Ricci tensors, or global symmetry currents as the external legs. These diagrams have the form of a triangle in 4 spacetime dimensions, which generalizes to a hexagon in D = 10, thus involving 6 external lines. The interesting anomaly in SUSY D = 10 gauge theory is the hexagon which has a particular linear combination of the two-form gauge field strength and Ricci tensor, F^6,\\\\ F^4 R^2,\\\\ F^2 R^4,\\\\ R^6, for the external lines. Green and Schwarz realized that one can add a so- called Chern‚ÄìSimons term to the classical action, having the form S_{GS} = \\\\int B_{2}\\\\wedge X_8, where the integral is over the 10 dimensions, B_{2} is the rank-two Kalb‚ÄìRamond field, and X_8 is a gauge invariant combination of F^4,\\\\ F^2 R^2,\\\\ R^4 (with space-time indices not contracted), which is precisely one of the factors appearing in the hexagon anomaly. If the variation of B_{2} under the transformations of gauge field for F_{(2)} and under general coordinate transformations is appropriately specified, then the Green‚ÄìSchwarz term S_{GS}, when combined with a trilinear vertex through exchange of a gauge boson, has precisely the right variation to cancel the hexagon anomaly.

The Royal Hospital Chelsea, often called simply Chelsea Hospital, is a retirement home and nursing home for some 300 veterans of the British Army. It is a 66-acre site located on Royal Hospital Road in Chelsea, London. It is an independent charity and relies partly upon donations to cover day-to-day running costs to provide care and accommodation for veterans. Any man or woman who is over the age of 65 and served as a regular soldier may apply to become a Chelsea Pensioner (i.e. a resident), on the basis they have found themselves in a time of need and are \\"of good character\\". They must not, however, have any dependent spouse or family and former Officers must have served at least 12 years in the ranks before receiving a commission. The site for the Royal Hospital was an area of Chelsea which held an incomplete building \\"Chelsey College\\", a theological college James I founded in 1609. The Royal Hospital opened its doors to the Chelsea Pensioners in 1692 for \\"the relief and succour\\" of veterans. Some of the first soldiers admitted included those injured at the Battle of Sedgemoor. The hospital maintains a 'military-based culture which puts a premium on comradeship'. The in-pensioners are formed into three companies, each headed by a Captain of Invalids (an ex-Army officer responsible for the 'day to day welfare, management and administration' of the pensioners under his charge). There is also a Secretary who traditionally was responsible for paying the Army pensions, but today they look after the annual budget, staff, buildings and grounds. Further senior staff include the Physician & Surgeon, the Matron, the Quartermaster, the Chaplain and the Adjutant.Annual Report, 2011 A Board of Commissioners has governed the Royal Hospital since 1702. The ex-officio chairman of the board is HM Paymaster General (whose predecessor Sir Stephen Fox was instrumental in founding the Hospital in the seventeenth century).

Greenwich Hospital was a permanent home for retired sailors of the Royal Navy, which operated from 1692 to 1869. Its buildings were later used by the Royal Naval College, Greenwich and the University of Greenwich, and are now known as the Old Royal Naval College. The word \\"hospital\\" was used in its original sense of a place providing hospitality for those in need of it, and did not refer to medical care, although the buildings included an infirmary which, after Greenwich Hospital closed, operated as Dreadnought Seaman's Hospital until 1986. The foundation which operated the hospital still exists, for the benefit of former Royal Navy personnel and their dependants. It now provides sheltered housing on other sites. The hospital was created as the Royal Hospital for Seamen at Greenwich on the instructions of Queen Mary II, who had been inspired by the sight of wounded sailors returning from the Battle of La Hogue in 1692. She ordered the King Charles wing of the palace‚Äîoriginally designed by architect John Webb for King Charles II in 1664‚Äîto be remodelled as a naval hospital to provide a counterpart for the Chelsea Hospital for soldiers. Sir Christopher Wren and his assistant Nicholas Hawksmoor gave their services free of charge as architects of the new Royal Hospital. Sir John Vanbrugh succeeded Wren as architect, completing the complex to Wren's original plans.J. Bold, P. Guillery, D.

The Old Soldier's Home, now known as the Armed Forces Retirement Home, was the site of President Lincoln's Cottage, which served as Lincoln's summer home during the American Civil War. It is adjacent to National Cemetery, the first federal military cemetery in the United States. The Home has remained in continuous use since its establishment. It is located on a wooded campus overlooking the U.S. Capitol in the heart of Washington, D.C. and continues to serve as a retirement home for U.S. enlisted men and women. Both the Washington, D.C. and Gulfport soldiers' and sailors' homes are funded through a small monthly contribution from the pay of members of the U.S. Armed Services. Following the American Civil War the federal government increased the number of National Military Homes, and took over a few formerly state-run old soldiers' homes. By 1933 there were 17 federally managed veterans homes. All except the first two of these homes were eventually combined with other federal government agencies to become part of what is now called the Veterans Administration, or U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs established in 1930. State homes Caring for the disabled and elderly, and the widows and orphans of men who died in the war became a concern even before the Civil War ended. For example, in 1864 Fitch's Home for Soldiers and Their Orphans was opened with private donations in Connecticut. Various female benevolent societies pushed for the creation of a long-term care federal or state soldier home system at the end of the war.Trevor K. Plante, \\"Genealogy Notes: The National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers\\" in Prologue Magazine [Online] Spring 2004, Vol. 36, No. 1 at https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2004/spring/soldiers-home.html (Retrieved 17 December 2009). Large veterans organizations like the Grand Army of the Republic and United Confederate Veterans eventually also worked for the creation of federal and state homes to care for disabled or elderly veterans. In a few cases veterans organizations on their own raised the money to buy property and build veterans homes. Most of these were quickly turned over to the state government to fund and manage. The majority of state legislatures established veterans homes paid for by state monies from the start. 43 states managed 55 functioning state veterans homes before 1933. Fourteen of those states also had a federal veterans home open at the same time as their state veterans home. Eleven states had two or more state veterans homes in operation at the same time (two of which also had a federal home). Some states simply had several homes at once. A few states admitted veterans' widows, and a few other states established separate homes for the widows and orphans. A few states had separate Union and Confederate old soldiers' homes. The first of 16 Confederate homes was opened in 1881 in Georgetown, Kentucky.R. B. Rosenburg, Living Monuments: Confederate Soldier's Homes in the New South (Chapel Hill, N.C.: Univ. of North Carolina Press, 1993), 28‚Äì29, citing Georgetown Weekly Times, 13 July; 30 November 1881; 14 November 1883; \\"Confederate Soldiers' Home,\\" \\"Subscribers to Confederate Soldiers' Home and Widows' and Orphans' Asylum,\\" Kentucky State Archives, Frankfort; Southern Historical Society Papers, 11 (1883): 432. Confederate soldiers' homes were supported entirely by subscribers or by the states, with no funds from the federal government against which the Confederates had fought. A few state-run old soldiers' homes were eventually folded into the federal veterans home system. As their last few Civil War veterans were dying in the 1930s, some states chose to close their old soldiers' homes, and other states began admission of veterans from more recent wars. Several of these state old soldiers' homes have been modernized and stop serve veterans. City homes Soldier homes in major cities were among the earliest, usually starting more as hotels for men passing through town, but increasingly taking on disabled servicemen. These were usually operated as paying businesses rather than being fully funded by the government. Philadelphia had two soldiers' homes which were associated with nearby saloons and got their start as a part of the refreshment and lodging business.Library Company of Philadelphia, \\"McA 5778.F Civil War Volunteer Saloons and Hospitals Ephemera Collection 1861‚Äê1868\\" ([Philadelphia, Pa.: LCP, 2006), 5. Digitized at http://www.librarycompany.org/mcallister/pdf/saloons.pdf (Retrieved 16 December 2009). Women activists also helped establish disabled soldiers' homes in Boston, Chicago, and Milwaukee, or in conjunction with the U.S. Sanitary Commission in 25 other cities. The Boston home closed in 1869, the Philadelphia homes closed in 1872, the Chicago Soldiers' Home lasted until 1877, and Milwaukee turned into a federal home. US Sanitary Commission homes, lodges, and rest During the Civil War, the US Sanitary Commission provided Union servicemen \\"Temporary aid and protection,‚Äîfood, lodging, care, etc.,‚Äîfor soldiers in transitn[sic], chiefly the discharged, disabled, and furloughed.\\" By 1865 the Commission operated 18 \\"soldiers' homes,\\" 11 \\"lodges,\\" and one \\"rest\\" in 15 states north and south (for a list see Commission bulletin, 3:1279). Most of their homes were war-time facilities and were closed at war's end. They are not included in the following list.

The most famous wines produced here‚Äîthose commonly referred to as \\"Burgundies\\"‚Äîare dry red wines made from pinot noir grapes and white wines made from chardonnay grapes. Red and white wines are also made from other grape varieties, such as gamay and aligot√©, respectively. Small amounts of ros√© and sparkling wines are also produced in the region. Chardonnay-dominated chablis and gamay-dominated beaujolais are formally part of the Burgundy wine region, but wines from those subregions are usually referred to by their own names rather than as \\"Burgundy wines\\". Burgundy has a higher number of ' (AOCs) than any other French region, and is often seen as the most '-conscious of the French wine regions. The various Burgundy AOCs are classified from carefully delineated ' vineyards down to more non-specific regional appellations. The practice of delineating vineyards by their ' in Burgundy goes back to medieval times, when various monasteries played a key role in developing the Burgundy wine industry. Geography and climate The Burgundy region runs from Auxerre in the north to M√¢con in the south, or to Lyon if the Beaujolais area is included as part of Burgundy. Chablis, a white wine made from Chardonnay grapes, is produced in the area around Auxerre. Other smaller appellations near Chablis include Irancy, which produces red wines and Saint-Bris, which produces white wines from Sauvignon blanc. There are 100 Appellations in Burgundy and these are classified into four quality categories. These are Bourgogne, village, premier cru and grand cru. Eighty-five miles southeast of Chablis is the C√¥te d'Or, where Burgundy's most famous and most expensive wines originate, and where all Grand Cru vineyards of Burgundy (except for chablis grand cru) are situated. The C√¥te d'Or itself is split into two parts: the C√¥te de Nuits which starts just south of Dijon and runs till Corgoloin, a few kilometers south of the town of Nuits-Saint-Georges, and the C√¥te de Beaune which starts at Ladoix and ends at Dezize-les-Maranges. The wine-growing part of this area in the heart of Burgundy is just long, and in most places less than wide. The area is made up of tiny villages surrounded by a combination of flat and sloped vineyards on the eastern side of a hilly region, providing some rain and weather shelter from the prevailing westerly winds. The best wines - from grand cru vineyards - of this region are usually grown from the middle and higher part of the slopes, where the vineyards have the most exposure to sunshine and the best drainage, while the premier cru come from a little less favourably exposed slopes. The relatively ordinary \\"village\\" wines are produced from the flat territory nearer the villages. The C√¥te de Nuits contains 24 out of the 25 red grand cru appellations in Burgundy, while all but one of the region's white Grand Cru wines are in the C√¥te de Beaune (the exception being Musigny blanc). This is explained by the presence of different soils, which favour pinot noir and chardonnay, respectively. Further south is the C√¥te Chalonnaise, where again a mix of mostly red and white wines are produced, although the appellations found here such as Mercurey, Rully and Givry are less well-known than their counterparts in the C√¥te d'Or. Below the C√¥te Chalonnaise is the M√¢connais region, known for producing large quantities of easy-drinking and more affordable white wine. Further south again is the Beaujolais region, famous for fruity red wines made from Gamay grapes. Burgundy experiences a continental climate characterized by cold winters and hot summers. The weather is very unpredictable, with rains, hail, and frost all possible around harvest time. Because of this climate, vintages from Burgundy vary considerably.  History  Harvest time in the Chablis Premier Cru of Fourchaume Archaeological evidence establishes viticulture in Burgundy as early as the second century AD, although the Celts may have been growing vines in the region previous to the Roman conquest of Gaul in 51 BC. Greek traders, for whom viticulture had been practiced since the late Neolithic period, had founded Massal√≠a in about 600 BC, and traded extensively up the Rh√¥ne valley, where the Romans first arrived in the second century BC. The earliest recorded praise of the wines of Burgundy was written in 591 by Gregory of Tours, who compared it to the Roman wine Falernian. Monks and monasteries of the Roman Catholic Church have had an important influence on the history of Burgundy wine. The first known donation of a vineyard to the church was by king Guntram in 587, but the influence of the church became important in Charlemagne's era. The Benedictines, through their Abbey of Cluny founded in 910, became the first truly big Burgundy vineyard owner over the following centuries. Another order which exerted influence was the Cistercians, founded in 1098 and named after C√Æteaux, their first monastery, situated in Burgundy. The Cistercians created Burgundy's largest wall-surrounded vineyard, the Clos de Vougeot, in 1336. More importantly, the Cistercians, extensive vineyard owners as they were, were the first to notice that different vineyard plots gave consistently different wines. They therefore laid the earliest foundation for the naming of Burgundy crus and the region's terroir thinking. Since Burgundy is land- locked, very little of its wine left the region in Medieval times, when wine was transported in barrels, meaning that waterways provided the only practical means of long-range transportation. The only part of Burgundy which could reach Paris in a practical way was the area around Auxerre by means of the Yonne. This area includes Chablis, but had much more extensive vineyards until the 19th century. These were the wines referred to as vin de Bourgogne in early texts. The wines from C√¥te d'Or would then be called (vin de) Beaune. These wines first became famous in the 14th century, during the Babylonian Captivity of the Papacy in Avignon, which was reachable by Sa√¥ne and Rh√¥ne after some overland transport. In the extravagance of the papal court, Beaune was generally seen as the finest wine, and better than anything available in Rome at that time. The status of Burgundy wines continued in the court of the House of Valois, which ruled as Dukes of Burgundy for much of the 14th and 15th centuries. Their ban on the import and export of non-Burgundian wines, effectively shutting out the then popular wines of the Rhone Valley from north European markets, gave a considerable boost to the Burgundy wine industry. It was during this era that the first reliable references to grape varieties in Burgundy were made. Pinot noir was first mentioned in 1370 under the name Noirien, but it was believed to have been cultivated earlier than that, since no other grape variety associated with Medieval Burgundy is believed to have been able to produce red wines of a quality able to impress the papal court. On 6 August 1395,Burgundy-Wines: History, accessed on 12 October 2008 Duke Philip the Bold issued a decree concerned with safeguarding the quality of Burgundy wines. The duke declared the \\"vile and disloyal Gamay\\" Le Figaro and La Revue du vin de France (2008) : Vins de France et du monde (Bourgogne : Chablis), L'histoire, p. 26.‚Äîwhich was a higher-yielding grape than Pinot noir in the 14th century, as it is today‚Äîunfit for human consumption and banned the use of organic fertilizer (manure), which probably increased yields even further to the detriment of quality. High-quality white Burgundy wines of this era were probably made from Fromenteau, which is known as a quality grape in northeastern France in this time. Fromenteau is probably the same variety as today's Pinot gris. Chardonnay is a much later addition to Burgundy's vineyards. In the 18th century, the quality of roads in France became progressively better, which facilitated commerce in Burgundy wines. The first n√©gociant houses of the region were established in the 1720s and 1730s. In the 18th century, Burgundy and Champagne were rivals for the lucrative Paris market, to which Champagne had earlier access. The two regions overlapped much in wine styles in this era, since Champagne was then primarily a producer of pale red still wines rather than of sparkling wines. A major work on Burgundy wines written by Claude Arnoux in 1728 deals with the famous red wines of C√¥te de Nuits and the ≈íil-de-Perdrix pink wines of Volnay, but only briefly mentions white wines. After Burgundy became incorporated in the Kingdom of France, and the power of the church decreased, many vineyards which had been in the church's hands were sold to the bourgeoisie from the 17th century. After the French revolution of 1789, the church's remaining vineyards were broken up and from 1791 sold off. The Napoleonic inheritance laws then resulted in the continued subdivision of the most precious vineyard holdings, so some growers hold only a row or two of vines. This led to the emergence of n√©gociants who aggregate the produce of many growers to produce a single wine. It has also led to a profusion of increasingly smaller, family-owned wineries, exemplified by the dozen-plus Gros family domaines. Vineyard in C√¥te de Beaune The awareness of the difference of quality and style of Burgundy wines produced from different vineyards goes back to Medieval times, with certain climats being more highly rated than others. An early author on this aspect of Burgundy wines was Denis Morelot with his La Vigne et le Vin en C√¥te d'Or from 1831. In 1855, the same year as the famous Bordeaux Wine Official Classification was launched, Dr. Jules Lavalle published an influential book, Histoire et Statistique de la Vigne de Grands Vins de la C√¥te-d'Or, which included an unofficial classification of the Burgundy vineyards in five classes and which built on Morelot's book. In decreasing order, Lavalle's five classes were hors ligne, t√™te de cuv√©e, 1√®re cuv√©e, 2me cuv√©e and 3me cuv√©e. Lavalle's classification was formalized in modified form by the Beaune Committee of Agriculture in 1861, and then consisted of three classes. Most of the \\"first class\\" vineyards of the 1861 classification were made into Grand Cru appellations d'origine contr√¥l√©es when the national AOC legislation was implemented in 1936. Burgundy wine has experienced much change over the past 75 years. Economic depression during the 1930s was followed by the devastation caused by World War II. After the War, the vignerons returned home to their unkempt vineyards. The soils and vines had suffered and were sorely in need of nurturing. The growers began to fertilize, bringing their vineyards back to health. Those who could afford it added potassium, a mineral fertilizer that contributes to vigorous growth. By the mid-1950s, the soils were balanced, yields were reasonably low and the vineyards produced some of the most stunning wines in the 20th century. For the next 30 years, they followed the advice of renowned viticultural experts, who advised them to keep spraying their vineyards with chemical fertilizers, including potassium. While a certain amount of potassium is natural in the soil and beneficial for healthy growth, too much is harmful because it leads to low acidity levels, which adversely affect the quality of the wine. As the concentration of chemicals in the soil increased, so did the yields. In the past 30 years, yields have risen by two-thirds in the appellations contr√¥l√©es vineyards of the C√¥te d'Or, from 29 hectoliters per hectare (hl/ha) (yearly average from 1951 to 1960) to almost 48 hl/ha (1982‚Äì91), according to a study by the Institut National des Appellations d'Origine. With higher yields came wines of less flavor and concentration. Within 30 years, the soils had been significantly depleted of their natural nutrients. The period between 1985 and 1995 was a turning point in Burgundy. During this time, many Burgundian ' renewed efforts in the vineyards and gradually set a new course in winemaking, producing deeper, more complex wines. Today, the Burgundy wine industry is reaping the rewards of those efforts.  Wine characteristics and classification  A label used on a 1984 bottle's neck, showing the Burgundy coat of arms A white wine made from declassified AOC Meursault wine that is sold as a general AOC Bourgogne. Burgundy is in some ways the most terroir-oriented region in France; immense attention is paid to the area of origin, and in which of the region's 400 types of soil a wine's grapes are grown. As opposed to Bordeaux, where classifications are producer-driven and awarded to individual chateaux, Burgundy classifications are geographically-focused. A specific vineyard or region will bear a given classification, regardless of the wine's producer. This focus is reflected on the wine's labels, where appellations are most prominent and producers' names often appear at the bottom in much smaller text. The main levels in the Burgundy classifications, in descending order of quality, are: Grand crus, Premier crus, village appellations, and finally regional appellations:Wine Pages: Burgundy by Tom Cannavan , accessed on 12 October 2008The Wine Doctor: Burgundy Wine Guide - Introduction and the C√¥te d'Or, accessed on 12 October 2008 * Grand Cru wines are produced by a small number of the best vineyard sites in the C√¥te d'Or region, as strictly defined by the AOC laws. These Cru wines make up 2% of the production at 35 hl/ha, and are generally produced in a style meant for cellaring, and typically need to be aged a minimum of five to seven years. The best examples can be kept for more than 15 years. Grand Cru wines will only list the name of the vineyard as the appellation - such as Corton or Montrachet - on the wine label, plus the Grand Cru term, but not the village name.Burgundy Wines: Labelling Grands crus, accessed on 12 October 2008 * Premier Cru wines are produced from specific vineyard sites that are still considered to be of high quality, but not as well regarded as the Grand Cru sites. Premier Cru wines make up 12% of production at 45 hl/ha. These wines often should be aged three to five years, and again the best wines can keep for much longer. Premier Cru wines are labelled with the name of the village of origin, the Premier Cru status, and usually the vineyard name, for example, \\"Volnay 1er Cru Les Caillerets\\". Some Premier Cru wines are produced from several Premier Cru vineyards in the same village, and do not carry the name of an individual vineyard.Burgundy Wines: Labelling Premiers crus, accessed on 12 October 2008 * Village appellation wines are produced from a blend of wines from supposedly lesser vineyard sites within the boundaries of one of 42 villages, or from one individual but unclassified vineyard. Wines from each different village are considered to have their own specific qualities and characteristics, and not all Burgundy communes have a village appellation. Village wines make up 36% of production at 50 hl/ha. These wines can be consumed two to four years after the release date, although again some examples will keep for longer. Village wines will show the village name on the wine label, such as \\"Pommard\\", and sometimes - if applicable - the name of the single vineyard or climat where it was sourced.Burgundy Wines: Village appellations and 'climates', accessed on 12 October 2008 Several villages in Burgundy have appended the names of their Grand Cru vineyards to the original village name - hence village names such as \\"Puligny-Montrachet\\" and \\"Aloxe-Corton\\". * Regional appellation wines are wines which are allowed to be produced over the entire region, or over an area significantly larger than that of an individual village.Burgundy Wines: Regional appellations, accessed on 12 October 2008 At the village, Premier Cru and Grand Cru levels, only red and white wines are found, but some of the regional appellations also allow the production of ros√© and sparkling wines, as well as wines dominated by grape varieties other than Pinot noir or Chardonnay. These appellations can be divided into three groups: An AOC Bourgogne Pinot noir. :* AOC Bourgogne, the standard or \\"generic\\" appellation for red or white wines made anywhere throughout the region, and represent simpler wines which are still similar to the village. These wines may be produced at 55 hl/ha. These wines are typically intended for immediate consumption, within three years after the vintage date. :* Subregional (sous- r√©gional) appellations cover a part of Burgundy larger than a village. Examples are Bourgogne Hautes-C√¥tes de Beaune, Bourgogne Hautes-C√¥tes de Nuits and M√¢con-Villages. Typically, those communes which do not have a village appellation will have access to at least one subregional appellation. This level is sometimes described as intermediate between AOC Bourgogne and the village level. :* Wines of specific styles or other grape varieties include white Bourgogne Aligot√© (which is primarily made with the Aligot√© grape), red Bourgogne Passe-Tout-Grains (which can contain up to two-thirds Gamay) and sparkling Cr√©mant de Bourgogne. Chablis wines are labeled using a similar hierarchy of Grand Cru, Premier Cru, and Village wines, plus Petit Chablis as a level below Village Chablis. Wines from Beaujolais are treated still differently. In general, producers are always allowed to declassify their wine in steps to a lower-ranked AOC if they wish to do so. Thus, a wine from a Grand Cru vineyard may be sold as a Premier Cru from that vineyard's village, a Premier Cru wine may be sold as a Village wine, and so on. This practice will almost invariably mean the declassified wine will have to be sold at a lower price, so this is only practiced when something is to be gained overall in the process. One motive may be to only include vines of a certain age in a Grand Cru wine, to improve its quality and raise its prestige and price, in which case the wine coming from younger vines may be sold as a Premier Cru at a lower price. Overall, such a practice may allow a producer to keep a higher average price for the wine sold. In total, around 150 separate AOCs are used in Burgundy, including those of Chablis and Beaujolais.Arr√™t√© du 19 juillet 2004 relatif √† la composition des comit√©s r√©gionaux vins et eaux-de-vie de l'Institut national des appellations d'origine - document listing which regional committee is responsible for approving wines which appellation While an impressive number, it does not include the several hundred named vineyards (lieux-dits) at the Village and Premier Cru level, which may be displayed on the label, since at these levels, only one set of appellation rules is available per village. The total number of vineyard-differentiated AOCs that may be displayed is well in excess of 500. Production One of the main wineries that produces Cr√©mant de Bourgogne In 2003, the Burgundy vineyards (including Chablis but excluding Beaujolais) covered a total of . C√¥te d'Or as a whole, including Hautes C√¥tes de Beaune and Hautes C√¥tes de Nuits, covered , of which the heartland of C√¥te de Nuits covered and C√¥te de Beaune .Burgundy Report: Burgundy in Context , accessed on 12 October 2008 In 2000, Burgundy had a total of 3,200 wine domaines (compared to 50 in the early 19th century), of which 520 were in the department of Yonne, 1,100 in C√¥te-d'Or and 1,570 in Sa√¥ne-et-Loir. Generally, the small growers sell their grapes to larger producers, merchants called n√©gociants, who blend and bottle the wine. The roughly 115 n√©gociants who produce the majority of the wine only control around 8% of the area. Individual growers have around 67% of the area, but produce and market only around 25% of the wine. Some small wineries produce only 100‚Äì200 cases/year, while many producers make a few thousand cases/year. Grower/producer-made wines can be identified by the terms Mis en bouteille au domaine, Mis au domaine, or Mis en bouteille √† la propri√©t√©. The largest producer is Maison Louis Latour in Beaune with 350,000 cases/year. The n√©gociants may use the term Mis en bouteille dans nos caves (bottled in our cellars), but are not entitled to use the estate-bottled designation of the grower/producers.Wine-Searcher Glossary of Wine Terms, accessed on 19 December 2009 Most n√©gociants tend to use the term Mis en bouteille par... (bottled by...). Grape varieties Burgundy vineyards: The Hautes-C√¥tes de Nuits Of the white grapes, Chardonnay is the most common. Another grape found in the region, Aligot√©, tends to produce cheaper wines which are higher in acidity. Aligot√© from Burgundy is the wine traditionally used for the Kir drink, where it is mixed with black currant liqueur. Sauvignon blanc is also grown in the Saint Bris appellation. Chablis, M√¢con wines and the C√¥te d'Or whites are mostly produced from 100% Chardonnay grapes. Of the red grapes, the majority of production in the C√¥te d'Or is focused on the Pinot noir grape, while the Gamay grape is grown in Beaujolais. In the C√¥te de Nuits region, 90% of the production is red grapes. Rules for the red Burgundy appellations, from regional to Grand Cru level, generally allow up to 15% of the white grape varieties Chardonnay, Pinot blanc and Pinot gris to be blended in,INAO: AOC rules for Chambertin and Chambertin-Clos-de-B√®ze, updated until 26 March 1998 but this is not widely practiced today. Reputation and appreciation A sparkling Cr√©mant de Bourgogne blanc de noirs (white of blacks) made from Pinot noir and Gamay. Burgundy is home to some of the most expensive wines in the world, including those of Domaine de la Roman√©e-Conti, Domaine Leroy, Henri Jayer, Domaine Leflaive and Domaine Armand Rousseau. Its renown goes back many centuries; in 1522 Erasmus wrote: \\"O happy Burgundy which merits being called the mother of men since she furnishes from her mammaries such a good milk\\"Les Grand Vins de France bypaul Ramain, 1931, Laffitte reprints, p 65 This was echoed by Shakespeare, who refers in King Lear to \\"the vines of France and milk of Burgundy\\". British wine critic Jancis Robinson emphasizes, \\"price is an extremely unreliable guide\\" and \\"what a wine sells for often has more to do with advertising hype and marketing decisions than the quality contained in the bottle.\\" While Grand Crus often command steep prices, village level wines from top producers can be found at lower price points. In 2010, the Burgundy region experienced a notable increase in internet coverage thanks to official efforts like the online broadcast of the famous Hospices de Beaune,Le Bien Publique \\"Luchini fait le show et explose le record des ventes aux ench√®res de Beaune\\" , accessed on 14 December 2010 as well as the efforts of independent wine aficionados, such as Bourgogne Live.Le Bien Public \\"Le Chardonnay tr√®s net\\" , accessed on 14 December 2010France3 \\"Une d√©gustation en ligne\\" , accessed on 14 December 2010 Some burgundies are also increasingly valued as investment wines.

A former silver screen starlet, she was perhaps best known for her starring role as Joanne on the CBS/NBC soap opera Search for Tomorrow, which she played for 35 years without interruption (1951‚Äì86). After her divorce from her first husband, with whom she raised two children, she began a side career as a guitarist and a singer- songwriter, first singing on Search for Tomorrow and then releasing her own album in 1973. At the time of her death, she had played the role of Meta Bauer on the CBS soap opera Guiding Light for six years. For her work in daytime drama, she was given the Lifetime Achievement Daytime Emmy Award. Early years Stuart was born in Miami, Florida, to Guy M. and Mary (n√©e Stuart) Houchins. She grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where she graduated from Tulsa Central High School and attended the University of Tulsa before embarking on her professional career. She left home at age 17 for New York City, where her career started, and where she returned after finding Hollywood too stressful. Her eventual stage name was her mother's maiden name. Career Film After appearing in various bit parts in several movies throughout the 1940s, Warner Brothers offered her a three-year contract in 1948. She appeared with such stars as Errol Flynn (in Adventures of Don Juan), Clark Gable (in The Hucksters), Esther Williams (in This Time for Keeps) and Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball (in The Big Street). Television After her film career ended, CBS offered Stuart a role in a new undertaking that would become known as the soap opera, or daytime serial. Their first project, The First Hundred Years, was short lived. It had been canceled after just one year on the air. The executives at CBS were wary of launching a second show, but they saw a future in soaps in the person of Mary Stuart after her screen test. It was then that they commissioned a second series. Stuart was cast as housewife \\"Joanne Gardner\\". The new serial was called Search for Tomorrow and it turned out to be very successful. Stuart would become synonymous with her character. Search for Tomorrow ran for thirty-five years until 1986 when it was finally canceled. During that time she was widowed three times and went through many trials and tribulations. She was the only soap star to receive a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for performance in a series but lost to Shirley Booth. During her stint as Joanne, she and co-star Larry Haines were given special Emmy recognition for their work. Executive producer Paul Rauch offered her the role of the crooked Judge Webber on ABC's One Life to Live which she played in 1988, then settled into retirement, having worked nearly 40 years. She wrote a short story that was published in a magazine, which was eventually made into a CBS movie of the week. In 1996, she came out of retirement and accepted the role of Meta Bauer, Ed's aunt who became a confidante of his daughter, Michelle, on Guiding Light, a part which had been played earlier by Ellen Demming. Stuart would play the role until her death. Coincidentally, Demming and Stuart both died in 2002, within weeks of each other. Music Stuart collaborated with Percy Faith on an album in 1956 and with Michel Legrand in 1973. She played guitar and she penned and sang songs on Search for Tomorrow, which fit into the script as her character was an amateur singer-songwriter, and she would sing songs to convey what she was feeling, usually when she was alone. Stuart also sang and played guitar on Christmas episodes, including, but not limited to, one notable Christmas in which Stuart sang \\"Bring a Torch, Jeanette, Isabella\\" with actresses Ann Williams and Melissa Murphy, who played her sister and daughter at that time. Stuart performed at her first public concert on January 8, 1974, at Catawba College in Salisbury, North Carolina. Personal life Stuart married Richard Krolik in August 1951. She gave birth to a daughter Cynthia in 1955 and a son Jeffrey in 1956. She and Krolik divorced in 1966. She later alleged in her book, Both of Me, that Krolik was a frequently verbally abusive husband. For example, she recounted that she had secretly been writing a children's book. When she showed the manuscript to Krolik, he threw it across the room, yelling, \\"How do you expect to write a book if you've never read one?\\" The incident discouraged Stuart so much that she never sought out a publisher. Her husband left New York to work at Time/Life Broadcasting in Washington, D.C. While Jeffrey Krolik kept his birth name, Cynthia changed hers to Cynthia Stuart. Cynthia graduated from the North Carolina School of the Arts and became a journalist writing for the Detroit Free Press She also followed in her mother's footsteps as an actress for a time.

Although Grey Teal tends to choose freshwater sites during the breeding season it is also known to be seen in coastal/salt waters occasionally as well as slightly brackish waters . In terms of elevation Grey Teal does not tend to populate in areas above 900m above sea level, instead prefers areas that are below 300m above sea level . When nesting Grey Teal choose to create its nests amongst vegetation on the ground level, this vegetation may include reeds and tall grasses . As well as this, it often elevates nests above ground in tree hallows . Ecology Life cycle/Phenology =Mating/Breeding behaviours= When establishing a pair-bond male Grey Teal will perform a series of displays, some of these include headshakes and head rolls . These displays tend to occur in adolescent birds before breeding season, whereas for mature birds in established pair-bonds courtship rituals are used . This is because Grey Teal pair-bonds are long term and monogamous . Meaning Grey teal keeps the same mate through seasons. Couples stay together all year however, when late summer moult comes they often join large flocks and stay with them until July . Moreover, ‚Äúafter breeding, [they] often gather at estuaries to feed on exposed mudflats‚Äù . On average, Grey teal starts breeding at one year old. In Australia there is no reproductive season as breeding is linked to rainfall and food abundance . The species had to adapt and breed in shallow temporary water. However, in New Zealand where the climate is more humid, breeding is more seasonal even if it is still related to water level. In terms of seasonality, Grey Teal will tend to breed in the summer-rainfall period . However, they will also breed at any time after a significant amount of rainfall . Thus, in New Zealand laying occurs between June and September ‚Äúbut replacement clutches can be laid through to January‚Äù . Therefore, their breeding time often shows seldom seasonal pattern Braithwaite, L., & Frith, H. (1969). Waterfowl in an inland swamp in New South Wales. 3. Breeding. CSIRO Wildlife Research, 14(1), 65-109. doi: 10.1071/cwr9690065. =Nesting= Nesting is usually solitary for Grey Teal; however, sometimes nesting sites will be close together, meaning breeding pairs may be close to one and other . Nests are often found in tree hallows or hidden amongst vegetation on the ground . Grey Teal is not known to construct nests other than using material found from its nesting site : grass and down . The female birds will create a bowl in the ground that they will proceed to fill with litter found from around the site as well as surround the nest/bowl with down (feather plumage). Between 1-7 eggs will be laid in a nest at a time Chambers, S. (2009). Birds of New Zealand - Locality Guide, (3rd ed., pp. 112-113), Arun Books, Orewa, New Zealand.. The nesting time occurs between the months of June-Feb in South Australia and slightly later in the area of North Australia due to a slight difference in temperature. Whereas in New Zealand Grey Teal tends to nest between the months of September-November . =Egg Laying= During the incubation period, the male Grey Teal will stand guard and protect the female and eggs while she incubates them for 25-31 days . The clutch (group of eggs) size of Grey Teal fluctuates with an average clutch size being between 6-14 eggs . Laying of each egg is done in approximately 24-hours intervals with laying occurring early in the morning . If a pair losses a brood (amount of chicks hatched at the same time) they will then begin to lay again only after a few weeks of this loss. Therefore, some pairs may lay several clutches per season . However, on average grey teal will lay approximately two broods per season . =Migration= For migratory birds living in stable temperate areas, day length and temperature bring migration about by triggering hormonal changes. However, for birds living in a stochastic environment where resources are often temporary (e.g. Grey teal Anas gracilis) hormonal control is less likely to allow good exploitation of resources hence allowing the survival of the species . In this type of environment birds have to be able to detect resourceful locations and relocate, meaning they have to move all year round and do not have a migration season. Grey teal is a great avian nomad that flies long distances. It ‚Äúis often the exemplar avian nomad in analyses movement and migration‚Äù. Thus, Roshier, D., Asmus, M., from Institute of Land, Water & Society, Charles Sturt University, Australia and Klassen, M., from Department of Plant-Animal interaction Netherlands Institute, Netherlands, led a study about the long-distance movements of Grey teal in Australia. Their goal was to determine what drives these long-distance flights. They found out that 13 out of 32 long-distance movements (> 150km) recorded were due to rainfall and/or flooding events that occurred up to 1050km from where the ducks initially were. Thus, it seems that water resources are a major reason in explaining the movements of Grey teal. However, some birds moved to other wetlands without clear beneficial reasons. So, according to Roshier, D., Asmus, M., & Klassen, M., there are two types of movements: ranging ‚Äì ‚Äúa search for a place to feed or breed that should stop when the resources being sought are encountered‚ÄùRobin, L., Heinsohn, R., & Joseph, L. (2009). Boom and Bust: Bird Stories for a Dry Country (pp. 83-86). ‚Äì and directed. Either way, ‚Äúthese flights occurred over distances up to 1,200km across the arid inland.‚Äù. Thus, Grey Teal disperse widely throughout the Australian continent due to adaption to environmental change such as flooding, extensive dry periods or lack of food . This process is carried out to seek their preferred environment of shallow wetlands with sufficient food supply and suitable breeding conditions. However, it is uncertain as to whether this behaviour should be referred to as 'migration' or whether a more appropriate term would be 'ranging' . The same applies in New Zealand where the species is very mobile. This flying skill implies that the local population of Grey teal changes constantly, both in New Zealand and Australia, which can lead to quick changes in numbers at any locality. =Moulting= Adult Grey teal, Anas gracilis, undergoes a flightless moult that is not fixed in the year. Before breeding season mature birds, both male and female, will undergo a body moult that excludes the wings . Then after breeding season, both partners will undergo a complete body moult (including wings). According to Janet Kear (2005), in Australia the moult of this species is correlated with climate conditions. Indeed during prolonged wet season birds postpone wing moult in order to extend the breeding one ‚Äì probably in order to better exploit wetlands resources. This postponement could be explained by the fact that ducks try not to moult and breed at the same time. For some species of birds it is even impossible to do both simultaneously Newton, I. (2010) The migration ecology of birds. Retrieved from: https://books.google.co.nz/. If we have to draw a tendency we could say that body moult (including wings) generally occurs between the months of January to March when it is late summer or early winter . Juveniles will undergo a complete moult of the entire body other than the wings, occurring in the first autumn or early winter . =Brooding= Female Grey Teals will brood young by themselves, however, when necessary (e.g. death of female) the male will take over the brooding role and raise the ducklings . Male will also often be present at the later stages of brooding as the female will return to incubate/lay her next clutch . After hatching, parents and broods may remain close to each other for a number of weeks, once the young gains flight it then becomes independent . However, siblings will often stick together for a short amount of time once they have left home . =Juveniles= Fledging usually occurs between 35 and 40 days. Before that ducklings are grey-brown with off-white cheeks and underpart . For juveniles, both female and male Grey Teal become reproductively mature at one-year-old . Therefore the forming of a pair-bonding will commonly occur in the first winter . Survival rates and life expectancy From a study completed J.A.Mills on the morality and Status of Grey Teal in New Zealand, approximate survival rates were established. To establish the rate of survival, the birds were banded. It was recorded that 68% of juveniles die within the first year of life, 77% by their first two years of life and then 85% by the end of their fourth year . Thus resulting in approximately 0.96 years of expected life for juveniles after they have been banded (age of 2-4 months). For Grey Teal that survive to one year of age, they are expected to have a further 2.9 years of life. For adults, the mean average was 50% of deaths annually, whereas for juveniles it was 68% . Similar results were shown in an Australian study where the mean average of deaths for adults was 52%, and for Juveniles 66% . Therefore from the data collected, it can be assumed that Grey Teal has an approximate life expectancy of between 2-4 years old. However, some exceptions occurred since the oldest adult recorded in the wild in New Zealand was 9 years old. It was 21 years old in Australia . Diet and foraging =Food= Grey Teal has a diet mostly consisting of invertebrates from their habitat; these include; larva of midges, water beetles, mosquitoes and caddisflies . As well as seeds from aquatic plants, present in their habitat . Diet changes according to the locality and time of the year. Thus, in Australia Grey Teal feeds mostly on plant material and especially seeds. It constitutes 87-97% of their diet. Although insects are eaten throughout the year, their part in the diet increases in spring. Similarly, molluscs and crustaceans are important in the diet only during spring and autumn . In Australia, the youngest ducklings feed only on insects but the relative amount decreases to only 30% when they are four weeks old . =Foraging behaviour= Grey Teal will regularly retrieve their food through the process of either dredging out estuary mudflats or exposed margins of lakeside to filter out food. Dabbling and upending in shallow water areas is another technique used for food retrieval , to collect invertebrates from just below the water surface Leseberg, N., & Campbell, I. (2015). Birds and animals of Australia's Top End (p. 32).. To obtain seeds, Grey Teal will strip them from the aquatic vegetation \\\\. During breeding season Grey Teal will feed strictly in breeding pairs or family parties; however, once the breeding season is over they tend to feed as a flock . In terms of ducklings, they must forage for their own food as there is no feeding from parents that occurs . Grey teal will feed at both morning and night time . Predators, Parasites, and Diseases Predators, parasites and disease is an area that has not been particularly well studied in Grey Teal. However, in Australia, Grey Teal is considered as a game bird due to large population numbers . Therefore hunters and duck shooters are a significant predator of these birds. Whereas in New Zealand Grey Teal is a protected species . This means that it cannot be hunted for due to low population numbers. Grey Teal ducklings tend to be at higher risk of predation than adults. Other aviator predators pose a threat as they are known to take ducklings out of nests from approaching above . When in the water ducklings are at risk to eels, rats and swamp harriers as they have been known to predate when the ducklings are swimming . As well as this when adult Grey Teal are with broods they are at risk to predators such as ferrets and stoats . A known parasite affecting waterfowl is Sarcocystis, also known as rice breast disease that is caused by a parasitic protozoan Cole, R., & Friend, M. (1999). Parasites and Parasitic Diseases (Field Manual of Wildlife Diseases), 219-220.. Although this disease usually is asymptomatic (infected but shows no symptoms) if severe the infection can result in weakness, lameness and loss of muscle tissue . With these severe effects, this can increase the likelihood of predation on the infected species, thus increasing its chance of death . No specific cases of Sarcocystis have been found in Grey Teal; however, it is known that this parasite targets birds and more specifically waterfowl. Interesting Information =Song= The call of Grey Teal can be heard as a \\"cuck, cuck, cuck\\" that is relatively rapid and includes a sharp whistle . The male and female call of Grey Teal are different in terms of volume and type . The male's call tends to be more of a whistle, whereas the female's call is very loud and harsh sounding . For short-distance communication, the birds have a softer variation of their calls . Something interesting to note about Grey Teal's voice is that it is very similar if not identical to the voice of a Chestnut Teal . =An interesting fact about cues for movement= Most animals and birds living within the Northern Hemisphere in very temperate environments, therefore, cues for migration and movement involve the change in temperature or day length . However, cues for Grey Teal are believed to be more discrete. Although it is undetermined as to whether Grey Teal migrate specifically, its movement is triggered by cues such as; pressure gradients that occur due to changing weather systems, low-frequency sound/temperature, and visual cues such as lack of food source . As well as this, it is believed that Grey teal uses its sense of smell to move and find suitable wetland environments . Information from tracked Grey Teal reveals that some flight movements were due to distant thunderstorms occurring . These thunderstorms were hundreds of kilometres away; however, due to their production of low-frequency sound, Grey Teal could detect this occurrence and move towards the source . Due to Australia being close to the equator, it can become very dry and hot in most places. Therefore, the use of these cues is essential for Grey Teal to find wetland habitats aiding their survival. =Game season and conservation status= Grey teal, Anas gracilis, is fully protected in New Zealand. The population was estimated at 20,000 birds in 1976 and has increased to 50,000 in 2005 . In 2014 there would be about 120,000 Grey teal in New Zealand and over 1 million in the world Dyer, J. (2014) Grey teal ‚Äì reviving a spectacular success story stopped dead in its tracks. Retrieved from: https://fishandgame.org.nz/assets/Uploads/Grey-teal-reviving- a-spectacular-success-story-stopped-dead-in-its-tracks.pdf. Considering that now Grey Teal is a common bird in the island, the government considered adding the duck to the game bird list when the Wildlife Act was reviewed in 2010. However it did not occur and the bird kept its conservation status . According to John Dyer, northern Wildlife Manager, Auckland Waikato Fish & Game Council, this decision caused some troubles between the Department of Conservation and the hunters that felt ‚Äúmisled for decades‚Äù. Indeed, along with the conservation status come penalties if one kills the bird. Yet, it is difficult for hunters not to shoot Grey Teal as it is numerous and often be seen flying among huge flocks of game ducks . At least 6% of Grey teal population is shot during the hunting season . On the contrary, in Australia Grey teal is one of the most common birds shot during the hunting season . For instance, in 2014, in the state of Victoria the hunting season lasted 3 months ‚Äì while it only lasts 5 weeks in New Zealand ‚Äì and they could daily shot up to 10 Grey teal .

The Parallel Line Internet Protocol provides Link Layer services for the Internet Protocol, the protocol used for forming small local area networks and large computer networks, such as the Internet, enabling computers without standard dedicated networking hardware, such as Ethernet, but with older parallel port devices, to communicate. Operation The Internet Protocol Suite is the standards-based networking model and software specification for forming small and large computer networks, from local area networks to global communication systems, such as the Internet. It is usually implemented by software and hardware features that use Ethernet network interface cards, cabling, and networking switches or hubs. Early personal computers did not have Ethernet hardware included in their design and bus adapters were initially expensive. A solution to was to use the, at the time, standard parallel port, typically used for connection to a printer or similar output device. The ports on two computers are connected with a so-called null-printer cable, sometimes called a LapLink cable. The laplink cable connects five output pins of a parallel port to five input pins on the opposing port, for each direction. Due to the lack of an internal timing in the parallel ports, synchronization is implemented via software handshaking: four of the five pins are used for data transfer and one is used for synchronization. The logical values at these pins are read and written directly by the software via an input or output instruction. This method does not connect the bidirectional data lines of the two devices, in order to avoid both lines being active at the same time. The status lines ERROR, SLCT, PAPOUT, ACK and BUSY on one device are connected to data pins d0 through d4 respectively on the other. Transmission of a byte is accomplished by dividing it into two nibbles of four bits each. Each nibble is transmitted by setting the four data lines according to the four nibble bits and then toggling the acknowledge line. This toggle indicates the receiving host that the nibble is ready to be read. Once the receiving host has read the nibble, it toggles its synchronization line to tell the transmitter that the nibble has been read and that a new one may be sent. Both hosts use a toggle on their acknowledge lines to indicate that the read or write operation has been performed. As a result, each host has to wait for a toggle from the other host before proceeding with a new operation. As an example, the transfer of nibble proceeds as follows: t->r lines r->s lines operation 00010 0xxxx transmitter sets data lines to 0010 10010 0xxxx transmitter toggle ACK line receiver detects toggle and reads 0010 10010 1xxxx receiver toggle ACK line transmitter detects toggle When the transmitter detects the toggle, this procedure is repeated for the next nibble. Internet Protocol packets are sent over the line after encapsulating them into PLIP packets before transmission over the line. The encapsulated packet has the following structure: *packet length: 2 bytes, little endian *ethernet header (mostly used for backward compatibility) *the IP packet *checksum: 1 byte, sum modulo 256 of bytes in the packet The length and checksum are calculated over the second and third field only, so that the actual total length of the packet is three more than the length as reported in the first two bytes of the packet. Similar methods An analogous feature for serial communications ports is the Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP), using null-modem cables, but allows transfer of four bits at a time rather than one. It generally works at higher bitrates. The method is based on the \\"Crynwr\\" standard devised by Russ Nelson. Ethernet may also be used as a direct computer-to-computer communications method using an Ethernet crossover cable. Other point-to-point connections, such as USB host-to-host bridges or cables are also used to transfer files between two computers where a network is not necessary or available.

As a common ensemble group, the brass quintet has a broad repertoire containing musical genres from madrigals to jazz. The instrumentation for a brass quintet typically includes two trumpets or cornets, one French horn, one trombone or euphonium/baritone horn, and one tuba or bass trombone. Musicians in a brass quintet may often play multiple instruments. Trumpet players for instance may double on piccolo trumpets and flugelhorns. There can be variation in instrumentation depending on the quintet. In some quintets, the horn is replaced by an additional trombone. Euphonium may also be substituted for the trombone part. While the tuba is considered a standard, the range and style of many pieces lend themselves to being played with bass trombone as the lowest-pitched instrument. Additionally, some pieces call for the use of percussion instruments, particularly the snare drum, tambourine, or timpani. The contemporary brass quintet appeared in the late 1940s originating with the Chicago Brass Quintet, followed in the 1950s by the American Brass Quintet and the 1960s by the Eastman Brass Quintet. However, it was with the founding of Canadian Brass in 1970 that the brass quintet finally became a major hall attraction and accepted as a legitimate member of the chamber music world. Two members of the Chicago Brass Quintet can be credited with helping plant the seed for the commercial and musical success of the contemporary brass quintet: Arnold Jacobs, a tuba player, and Renold Schilke, a trumpet player. Canadian Brass established both the style and popularity of the quintet medium throughout the world, having performed more than five thousand concerts, selling more than 500,000 quintet music books, and creating a library of over 600 compositions and arrangements for brass quintet. They continue to be one of the most popular and recognizable contemporary brass quintets. The brass quintet has accrued a sizable amount of literature for an ensemble that was only firmly established halfway through the 20th century. Notable contributions to the literature include many commissions by modern ensembles such as the American Brass Quintet and transcriptions by other ensembles such as the Canadian Brass.

He was best known as the lead singer, bassist and composer of the gothic metal band Type O Negative. Before forming Type O Negative, Steele had created the metal group Fallout and the thrash band Carnivore. As the frontman for Type O Negative, Steele was known for his vampiric appearance, towering stature, rich bass vocals, and a dark, often self-deprecating sense of humor. His lyrics have been described as \\"often intensely personal, dealing with subjects including love, loss and addiction.\\" Steele credited Black Sabbath and the Beatles as his key musical influences. He has been listed among the \\"66 Best Hard Rock and Metal Frontmen of All Time\\" by Loudwire. Early life Steele was born on January 4, 1962, in Red Hook, Brooklyn to a Catholic family, and attended Edward R. Murrow High School located in the Midwood neighborhood of Brooklyn. His father was of Russian and Polish descent and his mother of Scottish-Irish, Norwegian, and Icelandic ancestry. He was raised in the Bensonhurst and Brighton Beach neighborhoods of Brooklyn. Steele was the youngest of six children, with five older sisters. His father fought in World War II and later worked at a shipyard. Steele started taking guitar lessons at age 12, before moving on to bass six months later. Though Steele was naturally left-handed, he played right-handed bass guitars throughout his career. This came about when one of his earliest bands, Aggression (also featuring Josh Silver), for which Steele played left-handed rhythm guitar, threatened to kick him out unless he switched to bass guitar. As a left-handed bass guitar proved to be too expensive at the time, Steele purchased a right-handed bass and taught himself to play it. Steele worked for the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation up until he began touring with Type O Negative in the summer of 1994. He was based at Brooklyn Heights Promenade, where his job involved park maintenance, driving vehicles including garbage trucks and steamrollers, and eventual promotion to the role of park supervisor. Steele considered his days working for the parks department to be among his happiest. Musical career Fallout and Carnivore (1979‚Äì1987) In 1979, Steele formed the heavy metal band Fallout. In 1982, after the split of Fallout, Steele formed the thrash metal band Carnivore. With Carnivore, Steele's lyrics were often harsh, dealing with religion, war, race and misogyny. Carnivore released their debut self-titled album in 1985. In 1986, Steele wrote lyrics for several songs on hardcore punk band Agnostic Front's second album Cause for Alarm. In 1987, Carnivore released Retaliation, before splitting up later that year. Type O Negative =Formation= Steele formed the band in 1989 along with his childhood friends Josh Silver, Kenny Hickey and Sal Abruscato (later replaced by Johnny Kelly). The band originally used the name \\"Repulsion\\", but had to change it in 1990 due to legal issues with the American grindcore band of the same name. The band then used the name \\"Subzero\\". Steele had a tattoo in mind of a minus sign contained within the number 0 that he originally intended to represent the Subzero band logo. After discovering that another band was already using the Subzero name, and with his tattoo in mind, Steele came up with the name \\"Type O Negative\\" after hearing a radio advertisement requesting donations of type O negative blood. When Type O Negative signed with Roadrunner Records, Steele signed his recording contract with a mixture of Suave hair conditioner and chocolate syrup mixed with food dye, contrary to popular belief that it was his own blood and semen. =Slow, Deep and Hard and The Origin of the Feces (1991‚Äì1992)= Type O Negative's debut album, Slow, Deep and Hard, was released in 1991. The album incorporated the thrash elements of Carnivore merged with doom metal. Steele had written the music in the space of one night in the aftermath of a relationship break-up, and this was reflected in the lyrical topics of heartbreak, fantasies of revenge, and the contemplation of suicide; something Steele had himself attempted: \\"On October 15th, 1989, I slashed my wrists. All I can say is that I fell in love with the wrong person.\\" Steele caused some controversy when touring in Europe to support Slow Deep and Hard, thanks to rumors about his social and political views, with some critics going so far as to brand him a Nazi sympathizer, even though his bandmate, Josh Silver, is Jewish. Steele suggested that the European press had misunderstood his humor, and that his sarcasm was sometimes lost in translation to print. In 1992, Type O Negative released the \\"live\\" album The Origin of the Feces. The album included a fictitious hostile audience and an evacuation of the venue after a bomb threat had supposedly been called in. This simulated some of the real- life response Steele and Type O Negative had recently received while on tour in Europe. The original album cover featured a close-up shot of Steele's anus. =Bloody Kisses, October Rust and World Coming Down (1993‚Äì2002)= In 1993, Type O Negative released their breakthrough album Bloody Kisses. The album focused primarily on romance, love, sex, and death. The song \\"Black No.1 (Little Miss Scare-All)\\" pays tribute to gothic subculture and is an ode to a goth girl Steele had once dated. Steele attacked his detractors with the songs \\"We Hate Everyone\\" and \\"Kill All the White People\\", which dealt directly with the band's rumored racist ideology and served to erode any such accusations. Bloody Kisses eventually achieved Platinum status and established Type O Negative as one of gothic metal's most influential bands. Type O Negative released the album October Rust in 1996. It featured a more multi-layered and melodic sound than its predecessor, though it retained similar lyrical themes. Steele penned the majority of the material on October Rust while on the road touring, though he had conceived some of the basic musical ideas during his early-teens. Steele designed the Vinland flag that first appeared on the October Rust artwork. It has since appeared on every subsequent release by the band. The flag encompassed a variety of Steele's interests, political beliefs and his heritage. Steele based the design on a Nordic cross flag that incorporates his favorite colors. The concept of Vinland is also referred to in the title of the track \\"The Glorious Liberation of the People's Technocratic Republic of Vinland by the Combined Forces of the United Territories of Europa\\". \\"My Girlfriend's Girlfriend\\" is a tale about a m√©nage √† trois that Steele based on a few true life experiences. The song \\"Green Man\\" had two meanings for Steele; it is written about the Celtic embodiment of nature, and Steele's time with the parks department, when young children called him the \\"Green Man\\" due to the green uniform he wore on the job. The song introduction includes a sample of the garbage truck once driven by Steele. The song \\"Red Water (Christmas Mourning)\\" is about his father's death. October Rust eventually achieved Gold status. Steele had been dealing with personal problems during the recording and mixing of 1999's stripped-down and heavier sounding World Coming Down. Themes of drug abuse and addiction appeared on the album, particularly on the song \\"White Slavery\\". Death also featured heavily on the album, with Steele mourning the loss of loved ones on the tracks \\"Everyone I Love is Dead\\" and \\"Everything Dies\\". Steele recounted his experience with psychiatric treatment on the song \\"Who Will Save the Sane?\\". On \\"Pyretta Blaze\\" Steele tells of his sexual fantasy involving fire. Steele noted the emotional strain caused by executing songs from World Coming Down in a live setting. The setlists for live shows performed since the initial tour to support World Coming Down usually featured very few selections from the album. In 2000, Steele made a guest appearance on the song \\"Just Say No To Love\\" from Iommi, the first solo album by Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi. In 2001, Steele made a guest appearance on the song \\"Cross the Line\\" from the Biohazard album Uncivilization. In 2002, he guest appeared on the track \\"Descent\\" from the Doro album Fight. =Life Is Killing Me and Dead Again (2003‚Äì2010)= Type O Negative released the album Life Is Killing Me in 2003. Lyrically the album deals with topics including self-pity, hatred, drugs, death and religion. On the title track Steele offers his criticism of the medical profession. The song \\"Nettie\\" centers around Steele's mother, while \\"Todd's Ship Gods (Above All Things)\\" is about his father. \\"The Dream is Dead\\" refers to Steele finding it difficult to celebrate Valentine's Day as the date coincides with the anniversary of his father's death. Steele wrote the song \\"(We Were) Electrocute\\" about a \\"stunning\\" ex-girlfriend, and how they would attract the interest of passers-by when out together as a couple. Steele's favorite female television characters are the inspiration for the track \\"How Could She?\\". \\"I Like Goils\\" makes light of the attention Steele received from gay men, specifically after his photoshoot for Playgirl magazine. Steele performing in Berlin with Type O Negative, 2007 In 2005, Type O Negative left Roadrunner Records. Steele had never been happy with the conditions of the recording contract and had described it as \\"a millstone around my neck\\". Steele alleged that Type O Negative's split from Roadrunner Records, aside from a poor offer, had to do with an unauthorized release of a \\"best of\\" compilation. Steele remained on friendly terms with the staff at Roadrunner Records and in October 2005 he appeared on the Roadrunner United album to help celebrate the label's 25th anniversary. There were unconfirmed rumors at one point of Steele's death after the band website posted an image of a tombstone bearing his name and the dates 1962‚Äì2005. According to an article dated May 14, 2005, Steele was not dead; the gag was related to their fresh signing with SPV Records. The website discontinued the tombstone picture in October 2005. In 2006, Steele reactivated Carnivore with a new lineup that included longtime Type O Negative collaborator Paul Bento. The band played at the Wacken Open Air festival in 2006. Steele made his final recording on the 2007 Type O Negative album Dead Again. He revealed on MTV's Headbangers Ball that the new alliance with SPV Records was probably his favorite thing about Dead Again from a production standpoint. Steele considered Dead Again to be less melancholic and more positive compared to the band's previous albums. The album cover depicts the Russian mystic Rasputin, a historical figure that Steele admired. The title track touches on drug abuse and Steele's sense of having killed part of himself after suffering a relapse. \\"Tripping a Blind Man\\" is a diatribe on how Steele felt after his involuntary commitment was brought about by his family. \\"Halloween in Heaven\\" is a song about dead rockstars that Steele was inspired to write by the death of his close friend Dimebag Darrell. Steele's final live performance was on Halloween night at Harpos Concert Theatre in Detroit, Michigan, the last show of Type O Negative's 2009 tour. Further appearances Playgirl Following the success of Bloody Kisses, Steele began to receive attention outside of music. He appeared as a nude centerfold of Playgirl in 1995. Steele later found out via bandmate Kenny Hickey's contacts that only 23% of the magazine subscribers were female, and after being asked by men to sign copies of the magazine, Steele somewhat regretted the decision: \\"After I did it, I thought, 'Oh my God, what did I do?' It was more than upsetting that so many guys had it. Girls, OK, but there just seemed to be at least as many guys. Not that I'm homophobic, but it was certainly irritating.\\" In a 2007 interview, Steele reflected on the posing as merely a na√Øve publicity stunt. Television and film Steele went on to appear as a guest on the talk shows Ricki Lake, The Jerry Springer Show, and The Howard Stern Show. In 2003, Steele had an acting role in the episode \\"Exeunt Omnes\\" of the HBO drama series Oz. Also in 2003 he appeared in the film Dirtbags (Armpit of Metal). He followed this with a role in the 2005 film Bad Acid. Steele is among the musicians featured in the 2011 documentary Living the American Nightmare. Personal life Steele at an in- store signing in London, circa 1997 Steele stood 6' 8\\" (203 cm) tall, giving him a menacing stage appearance. Despite that perception, Steele admitted to suffering from stage fright, which he overcame by drinking alcohol before shows, and by drinking red wine when on stage. He was also described as a person who was \\"friendly, funny and had a reputation for being generous to his longtime bandmates ... and kind to the bands he toured with.\\" In his autobiography Iron Man, Black Sabbath's Tony Iommi described his shock at Steele's death, adding, \\"Peter was a big, tall, and very, very nice guy.\\" Outside of music, Steele spent time lifting weights both at home and on his tour bus. Steele also enjoyed reading books on the subject of science and he had an interest in European culture. Steele liked working on his house and was interested in architecture and civil engineering. Steele also worked on his cars, including a heavily modified 1985 Pontiac Grand Prix he customized himself. Steele had a love for cats and kept several as pets. In the booklet for the 2009 \\"Top Shelf\\" edition re-release of Bloody Kisses, Steele confirmed that the album's dirge-like 11-minute title track had in fact been written about the death of a family cat called Venus he had owned for 17 years. During 2005, Steele disappeared for an extended period with no explanation. Rumors of his death, terminal illness, and other speculations increased until the mystery was dispelled in an interview on the 2006 DVD Symphony for the Devil. In the interview Steele briefly mentions his incarceration in Rikers Island and \\"the psych ward at Kings County Hospital\\". Steele's family members had staged an intervention and insisted he check into a mental institution. Steele later confirmed he had been suffering from paranoia caused by his heavy substance abuse. Steele had been using cocaine since the age of 35, a decision he expressed great regret about. Steele then attended rehab for cocaine dependence and alcoholism, and later served a 30-day prison term for assaulting a love rival. Steele made light of his incarceration by wearing a prison uniform on stage during live performances. Steele stated in a 2003 interview that he had bipolar disorder, and linked his mood swings to the types of songs he wrote. He also received occasional psychiatric treatment for depressive episodes. During a 2007 interview Steele explained: > \\"I've always been a very depressed person, but that's only one side of me, > you know. It makes me feel better when I can express my depression, my > anger, my frustration through music ... sonic therapy.\\" In April 2007, Steele revealed that he began identifying himself as Roman Catholic in recent years, after decades of self-professed atheism. In an interview with Decibel magazine, Steele explained: > \\"There are no atheists in foxholes, they say, and I was a foxhole atheist > for a long time. But after going through a midlife crisis and having many > things change very quickly, it made me realize my mortality. And when you > start to think about death, you start to think about what's after it. And > then you start hoping there is a God. For me, it's a frightening thought to > go nowhere. I also can't believe that people like Stalin and Hitler are > gonna go to the same place as Mother Teresa.\\"  Biography  Steele's biography Soul On Fire ‚Äì The Life And Music Of Peter Steele was penned by Metal Maniacs editor Jeff Wagner, and was released in 2013. None of the surviving band members cooperated with Wagner in the creation of the book. Death and tributes Prospect Park.

The was a former site of oil wells and is one of the few natural areas remaining within an urban landscape. Formed eons ago when the mountains of the Palos Verdes Peninsula rose to the south, Madrona Marsh is a shallow depression fed by wet season (spring) storms as the name \\"vernal\\" indicates. After the rainy season, evaporation, percolation and transpiration reduce the water depth by about one-quarter of an inch (6 mm) per day. By the end of August, the wetland is dry and remains so until the following rainy season. Situated on land that was set aside for oil production in 1924, Madrona Marsh was never developed while the city grew up around the site and remains a valuable natural habitat for birds, reptiles, insects and small mammals. Ongoing efforts are restoring native plants including wildflowers. Plantings may benefit local butterfly species including the Palos Verdes blue. The area has long been popular with bird watchers and The Audubon Society has used Madrona Marsh for their annual bird census since 1967. El Camino College uses it as an outdoor biology and botany lab. The City of Torrance operates the Madrona Marsh Nature Center in cooperation with the Friends of the Madrona Marsh. Activities include bird and nature walks, natural history classes and workshops, habitat restoration, science and astronomy programs, art exhibits, and children's nature programs. The center opened in 2001 and features exhibits about the plants, birds and animals of the marsh. The nature center for the Preserve is across the street.

The zoo was founded in 1868, making it one of the oldest zoos in North America. It is also one of a few free admission zoos in the United States. The zoo is an accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). Lincoln Park Zoo is home to a wide variety of animals. The zoo's exhibits include big cats, polar bears, penguins, gorillas, reptiles, monkeys, and other species totaling about 1,100 animals from some 200 species. Also located in Lincoln Park Zoo is a burr oak tree which dates to 1830, three years before the town of Chicago was incorporated. History Photochrom of the bear pit of the Lincoln Park Zoo, c. 1897-1901 Nature Boardwalk Video of Anana the polar bear swimming. News report from Voice of America of the 150th anniversary of the Lincoln Park Zoo. The zoo was founded in 1868, when the Lincoln Park Commissioners were given a gift of two pairsChicago Tribune \\"Swans in Lincoln Park\\" August 27, 1868 of swans by Central Park's Board of Commissioners in New York City. Other animals were soon donated to the park, including, a puma, two elk, three wolves, four eagles, and eight peacock. In 1874, a bear cub from the Philadelphia Zoo was the first animal purchased by the zoo. The bear became quite adept at escaping from its home and could frequently be found roaming Lincoln Park at night. In 1884, reportedly the first American bison born in captivity was born at the Lincoln Park Zoo. At this time, the species had almost been hunted to extinction in the wild‚Äîin 1896, the United States government purchased one bull and seven cows from the Zoo's bison herd to send to Yellowstone National Park to assist in the species' revival. From 1888 to 1919 the director of the Lincoln Park Zoo was the flamboyant Cy DeVry, who organized the collection, built many new structures, and obtained the zoo's first elephant and monkeys. A new Lion House opened in 1912. It was later renovated and reopened in 1990. The Primate House opened in 1927, and was known for housing a popular gorilla named Bushman (1931‚Äì1951), one of the only gorillas in a U. S. zoo at the time. The zoo's great apes were moved to the Lester E. Fisher Great Ape House in 1976, named for the zoo's outgoing director, and the original Primate House was later renovated and reopened in 1992 as the Helen Brach Primate House, featuring more naturalistic settings. Marlin Perkins, who gained fame as the host of the television program Zoo Parade and later, Wild Kingdom, was director of the zoo from 1944 until 1962. He created and recruited a citizens group to support the Zoo's mission, the Lincoln Park Zoological Society. The facility underwent a dramatic transformation in the 1970s and 1980s, with the additions of many new, naturalistic exhibits. In 1995, the Zoological Society assumed management of the zoo from the Chicago Park District, which remains the owner. Zoo administration is currently housed in the nearby building previously used by the Chicago Academy of Sciences, which moved to a new facility in 1999. The Kovler Sea Lion Pool opened the same year after an extensive renovation, and is now home to the zoo's harbor seals. Regenstein African Journey, a renovation of the zoo's former Large Mammal House, opened in 2003, turning the zoo's largest building from concrete showcases for a few large mammals into a series of naturalistic settings that tell the story of the wildlife of the African continent, welcoming the return of the zoo's African elephants and giraffes as well as new additions such as the aardvark, ostrich, and African wild dog. Two years later, the zoo renovated its Great Ape House, opening the Regenstein Center for African Apes, which focused on the zoo's troops of common chimpanzees and western lowland gorillas, putting a special emphasis on researching the behaviors of both species and creating new, naturalistic habitats. In 2003, the book The Ark in the Park: The Story of Lincoln Park Zoo was also published by the University of Illinois Press. The book was written by Mark Rosenthal, Carol Tauber, and Edward Uhlir. In 2010, Lincoln Park Zoo transformed the adjacent South Pond to create the Nature Boardwalk, an ecological habitat designed by Studio Gang Architects that features native wetlands plants and wildlife. In December 2011, the Kovler Penguin-Seabird House, which had previously been home to rockhopper, king penguins, common murres and puffins closed down after thirty years at the zoo due to worries about the deteriorating condition of the building, prompting outcry from some Chicago residents. It was soon announced it would be replaced with a newly renovated West Gate, featuring a children's train and an all-new exhibit, Regenstein Macaque Forest, featuring Japanese macaques, or \\"snow monkeys\\", in a state-of-the-art exhibit with a hot spring, set to open in fall 2014. It was announced in March 2014 that the zoo's Robert R. McCormick Bear Habitat, or \\"Bear Line\\", would be torn down and rebuilt with a large and significantly improved habitat for the zoo's lone polar bear, with much more land area for the bears and a behind-the-scenes den for breeding. The new exhibit would also feature a new African penguin habitat, a new species for the zoo from the tropical coasts of Africa, enabling them to stand the zoo's harsh summers as well as its cold winters. This exhibit would also be fully outdoors and equipped for over a dozen penguins with a behind-the-scenes breeding area. Construction began after the opening of Regenstein Macaque Forest in fall 2014, with Robert and Mayari Pritzker Penguin Cove opening in late 2016. In 2016, The zoo announced the Pride of Chicago fundraising campaign, which sought $125 million in funding, and lead to the construction of Regenstein Macaque Forest, Robert and Mayari Pritzker Penguin Cove and Walter Family Arctic Tundra, would conclude with a long-awaited $30 million renovation of the aging Kovler Lion House as part of the Pride of Chicago fundraising campaign, acknowledging the public perception problems with the exhibit, which had been constrained by its Historic Landmark status during previous renovations, most recently in 1992. The new exhibit would focus squarely on lions as opposed to other big cat species it had previously held, such as tigers . An exact date for the exhibit's reopening has not been set.Lincoln Park Zoo's Lion House to get makeover, shed tigers Programming The zoo together with technological help from the Adler Planetarium is aiming to expand its survey of Chicago area wildlife with public assistance at an interactive website, Zooniverse. The zoo has positioned motion sensing cameras in the Chicago area to catch images of wildlife, and the public is asked to help identify the animals. Exhibits The zoo's exhibits include big cats, polar bears, penguins, gorillas, reptiles, monkeys, and other species totalling nearly 1,100 animals. Walter Family Arctic Tundra Redeveloped from the former Robert R. McCormick Bear Habitat in the zoo's northeast corner, Walter Family Arctic Tundra is a new exhibit for the polar bear, larger than the previous habitat with more land for the bears to roam on; instead of strict rockwork, there is natural grass, a new underwater viewing area, a maternity den, and enough space to support a small breeding family of bears. *Polar bear Robert and Mayari Pritzker Penguin Cove Linked to the nearby Regenstein African Journey, Penguin Cove is a new outdoor African penguin exhibit, where visitors can watch as these tropical penguins dive into the water, with a behind-the-scenes area for hatching chicks and breeding the species. The zoo also offers indoor Penguin Encounters.Lincoln Park Zoo Introduces Penguin Encounters The exhibit opened to the public in October 2016. *African penguin Regenstein Macaque Forest Opened in 2014, Macaque Forest is an exhibit allowing guests to connect with a troop of 10-15 Japanese macaques in a camouflaged forest scene with views from both above and eye- level with the animals. The exhibit features a \\"hot spring\\", a trademark favorite of the species, which allows them to warm up in the winter and amuse guests. It also functions as a dedicated research station for the macaques. It is the zoo's third exhibit to house primates. *Japanese macaque Regenstein African Journey Black rhinoceros at Lincoln Park Zoo The Regenstein African Journey exhibit is a 60,000-square-foot indoor-and-outdoor exhibit which opened in May 2003 on the site of the zoo's former Regenstein Large Mammal House. It simulates four distinct habitats from the African continent. Large skylights permit natural light into the indoor area, and guests are greeted quickly by black-and-white colobus monkeys and African spoonbills in a rainforest setting as they enter Africa. The second section focuses on African rivers, with massive glass panels for hybrid land/water exhibits for West African dwarf crocodiles, endangered pygmy hippopotamuses, and a cichlid tank with an 11,000-lb., 7-in.-thick glass panel. The third section, focused on the African savanna, featured habitats for a large group of meerkats, a space for the zoo's aardvarks, and an indoor habitat for the Baringo giraffes. The fourth and final section simulates African kopje habitats, with klipspringer antelopes hopping along the way, yellow-collared lovebirds and Kenya crested guineafowl. The main outdoor exhibit is a large, expansive African savanna setting just outside the indoor exhibit exit that primarily houses the zoo's Baringo giraffes, as well as ostriches and Grant's gazelles. There is also a large yard for a family of rare African wild dogs, a hog yard that has been used by both warthogs and currently red river hogs, and multiple yards for the zoo's breeding black rhinoceros family. While many of these animals cannot be viewed indoors, they have access to indoor habitats year-round. When the exhibit opened, it was also home to three African elephants, but they died, the last one dying at Hogle Zoo in 2005, sparking concerns about the exhibit. It later briefly held Bactrian camels, but it is currently an additional home for the zoo's endangered rhinoceros. One noted resident of the exhibit was R1 (or Reptile One) the dwarf crocodile, who was seventy years old when he died in 2010, having lived within the zoo's Reptile House (now Park Place Caf√©), the Regenstein Small Mammal-Reptile House, and finally, Regenstein African Journey throughout his life. *Aardvark *Abdim's stork *African elephant (formerly) *Asian elephant (formerly) *Brazilian tapir (formerly) *Capybara (formerly) *African spoonbill *African wild dog *Bactrian camel (formerly; now in Antelope & Zebra Area) *Baringo giraffe *Black-and-white colobus *Bulbul *Diana monkey *Dwarf crocodile *Eastern black rhinoceros *Egyptian goose (formerly) *Grant's gazelle *Hadada ibis *Kenya crested guineafowl *Hottentot teal (formerly) *Klipspringer *Yellow-collared lovebird *Meerkat *Ostrich (formerly; now in Antelope & Zebra Area) *Plains zebra *Pygmy hippopotamus *Red-billed hornbill (formerly) *Red river hog *Secretary bird (formerly) *Violet Turaco *Warthog (formerly) Regenstein Center for African Apes Lincoln Park Zoo's dedication to primate research continued when the Lester E. Fisher Great Ape House was closed and rebuilt with a new focus on the two African ape species, the common chimpanzee and western lowland gorilla. The new center, opened in 2005, has over 29,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor living space for three ape troops, featuring dozens of trees, artificial vines, real and simulated bamboo, as well as skylights, waterfalls, moats, heated logs, and termite mounds for chimpanzees to illustrate their knowledge of tools to 'fish' for termites in their mounds. The exhibit has three spacious habitats ‚Äì the 12,000-square-foot Kovler Gorilla Bamboo Forest, an open-air habitat with a moat around it, dedicated to the zoo's main gorilla troop. Two additional exhibits - the Strangler Fig Forest and Dry Riverbed Valley - each with mesh netting to secure the animals, can accommodate either chimpanzees or gorillas. Huge glass panels give guests nose-to-nose access with the zoo's apes both in the trees and on the ground. The exhibit also contains the Lester E. Fisher Center for the Study and Conservation of Apes, which encourages zoo guests to engage in research and scientific development to conserve apes in the wild. Notable residents of this exhibit include Kwan, the current silverback in the zoo's gorilla troupe who appeared in the film \\"Return to Me\\" as Sidney, a chimpanzee named Optimus Prime, after the fictional character of the same name, and formerly Keo, the oldest male chimpanzee in a North American zoo at the time of his death in September 2013 at fifty-five. Custom-made stuffed animals of Kwan and Optimus in their likenesses are available in the zoo's Wild Things gift shop. *Common chimpanzee *Western lowland gorilla Pritzker Family Children's Zoo The new Pritzker Family Children's Zoo, which opened in 2004, features a number of native eastern American wildlife, and lets visitors of all ages connect with the wild creatures in our own backyard and engages them to think about how species survive in the wilderness. Small amphibians and reptiles are featured in a small indoor exhibit, along with a leaf-themed climber play area for youngsters designed by Tom Luckey, with slightly larger indoor exhibits for eastern screech owls, great plains rat snakes and American kestrels and large glass windows on each end so guests young and old can watch North American beavers and the popular North American river otters swim gracefully underwater at eye-level in their outdoor habitats, with educational displays about how beavers build dams. Outside the building there are many areas where local birds nest. The building is surrounded by small outdoor viewing areas for the same otter and beaver habitats as well as a small exhibit for wood ducks. There are two significantly larger exhibits surrounding the path around the building for the American black bear and the endangered red wolf featuring heavy foliage and a naturalistic stream, allowing visitors to go eye-to-eye with the animals or for the animals to hide in the foliage. Statues of gray wolves and signs encourage guests to practice howling and teach them about wolf pack dynamics. *American black bear *American kestrel *American toad *Blanding's turtle *Eastern box turtle *Eastern screech owl *Midland painted turtle *Mudpuppy *North American beaver *North American river otter *Northern pintail *Red wolf *Smooth green snake *Spotted turtle *Wood duck *Wood turtle Kovler Seal Pool 150px One of the zoo's most popular exhibits since its first iteration in 1879, the Kovler Seal Pool is one of oldest and most popular exhibits at Lincoln Park Zoo, and remains a favorite among zoo guests. The exhibit was renovated most recently in May 1999 in hopes of creating a habitat that most resembles their natural environment in the wild. There are three main viewing areas - from behind a fence in front of the tank on the main zoo path, an amphitheater-style seating area above the tank on the opposite end, and an underwater viewing gallery where visitors can watch the seals glide through the water. Signage around the exhibit teaches guests how to tell seals and sea lions apart. The zoo's pinnipeds are trained voluntarily twice a day, and given fish treats as rewards. Though multiple species of seal and sea lion have lived in the pool together in the past, since May 2013 it has been home only to three young harbor seals from SeaWorld. *California sea lion (formerly) *Gray seal *Harbor seal Lincoln Park Zoo Main Concourse Regenstein Small Mammal-Reptile House The Regenstein Small Mammal- Reptile House is a indoor exhibit that opened in 1997 and houses small animals in two main areas: the Gallery and the Ecosystem. The Gallery begins with a large room ringed with terrariums exhibiting reptiles and amphibians like axolotls, green tree pythons, poison dart frogs, and Sistrurus catenatus. The next part of the Gallery features dwarf mongooses, naked mole rats, straw- coloured fruit bats and other small mammals in and around a man-made baobab tree trunk. The building continues in the Ecosystem, a geodesic dome in height that simulates the world's tropical rainforests. The Ecosystem begins with a series of stream exhibits for dwarf caimans, dwarf crocodiles, and oriental small-clawed otters, continues with mixed-species exhibits for arboreal species like tamarins, two-toed sloths, and white-faced saki monkeys, and ends with exhibits for ground-dwelling Parma wallabies and Patagonian cavies.

These exhibits emphasize how birds-of-prey play a role as \\"nature's clean-up crew\\". One large, lush outdoor habitat contains multiple specimens, including breeding pairs of cinereous vulture and the European white stork, while two adjacent aviaries contain the zoo's resident bald eagle and the next features a snowy owl next door. A baby vulture was born at the zoo in June 2013 but was abandoned by its parents and had to be hand-reared and reintroduced gradually. *Bald eagle *Cinereous vulture *Himalayan monal *European white stork *Snowy owl Helen Brach Primate House The zoo's historic Primate House first opened in 1927, featuring apes and monkeys from different locations and habitats in a series of small, identical barred cages typical of most early zoo exhibits. It became famous for its apes, including a gorilla named Bushman, until the Great Ape House opened. The Primate House's interior was heavily renovated in the early 1990s and it was re-opened as the Helen Brach Primate House in 1992 with eight diorama-style naturalistic exhibits simulating the swamps and rainforests of the animals' natural habitats in the wild, showcasing species such as black-and-white colobus monkeys, De Brazza's monkeys, Francois' langurs, pied tamarins, Allen's swamp monkeys and black howler monkeys. Perhaps its most notable residents are a family of northern white-cheeked gibbons that have a spacious room inside as well as an outdoor habitat for playing in the warm winter months. The zoo's male and female gibbons gave birth to baby Daxin on August 16, 2013. Crowned lemurs joined the exhibit in October 2013 from the Indianapolis Zoo and a baby lemur was born at the zoo on April 14, 2014. *Allen's swamp monkey *Black howler *Black-and- white colobus *Crowned lemur *Drill (formerly) *Bolivian gray titi monkey *De Brazza's monkey *Francois' langur *Geoffrey's marmoset *Goeldi's marmoset *Pied tamarin *White-cheeked gibbon McCormick Bird House One of the zoo's most historic buildings, the McCormick Bird House was first designed in 1904 under Cyrus DeVry, the zoo's original director. It has been redesigned multiple times, most recently in 1991, and is currently home to multiple habitats recreating the tropics, savanna, sea shore, desert, wetlands, and other biomes, with a tropical free-flight aviary allowing guests to become immersed with perching and aquatic birds without fences or glass. Some of the zoo's most notable birds include the famous laughing kookaburra in the scrub display, multiple scarlet ibis specimens in its swamp display, Guam rail, a rare bird which is extinct in the wild in its native Guam, and the Bali mynah, a critically endangered bird that Lincoln Park Zoo breeds, while also maintaining the species' studbook. Thirty-one mynahs have been born at the zoo since 1972, with the most recent set of chicks being born in mid-2012. *Baer's pochard *Bali myna *Black-necked stilt *Blue-crowned laughingthrush *Blue- crowned motmot *Blue-faced honeyeater *Blue-gray tanager *Blyth's hornbill *Bourke's parrot *Crested wood partridge *Emerald starling *Fairy-bluebird *Golden-breasted starling *Green wood hoopoe *Green-naped pheasant pigeon *Guam Micronesian kingfisher *Guam rail *Hamerkop *Helmeted curassow *Inca tern *Jambu fruit dove *Kagu *Kikuyu white-eye *Laughing kookaburra *Lesser green broadbill *Mandarin duck *Masked lapwing *Nicobar pigeon *Piping plover *Red knot *Red-capped cardinal *Scarlet ibis *Snowy egret *Spotted thick-knee *Sunbittern *Taveta weaver *Tawny frogmouth *Toco Toucan (formerly) Antelope & Zebra Area Sichuan takinThe zoo's familiar four-acre Antelope & Zebra Area, built in 1982 on the south end of the main zoo, is an oval- shaped series of large grassland exhibits that house the zoo's diverse hoofstock and miscellaneous animals, most notably multiple Grevy's zebras, a group of alpacas, the white-lipped deer, a small herd of Bactrian camels that have been housed here historically besides a brief stay in Regenstein African Journey, as well as a breeding group of red kangaroos. During construction on Regenstein African Journey, it held the zoo's future Grant's gazelle collection. The Antelope & Zebra Area has historically held several species, including the Arabian oryx, as part of the animals' complex Species Survival Plan, and briefly a pair of sable antelope in 2011. The most recent additions, however, are the common waterbuck antelope from Africa and a rarity in an American zoo, the endangered Sichuan takin. The zoo has been successful with breeding the Sichuan takin - two baby takin were born together at the zoo in January and February 2013 and were named Xing Fu (\\"happy good fortune\\") and Mengyao (\\"superior handsomeness\\") after a poll on the Lincoln Park Zoo website.

Other big cats, such as the jaguar, were allowed rotating access to two to three indoor window exhibits at a time. The southern exterior included five lush habitats that housed a variety of different cat species over the years. In addition, they also held a pair of red pandas, which were part of the Species Survival Plan. The indoor area also has a large gift shop where visitors can purchase plush toys of big cats, bears, and other animals. Many of the species in the southern habitats shifted over the years, including Amur leopards, Eurasian lynxes, a Pallas's cat, and a puma in the exhibit's later years, with the last major addition being a one- year-old snow leopard named Taza who arrived on December 11, 2014.Taza Time. Retrieved 2014-12-23. One of the exhibit's notable residents was Adelor the African lion, who lived at the zoo from 1995 until his death in February 2012 and was one of the zoo's most popular animals. Upon his death, an anonymous donor paid for a statue of Adelor which now stands at the East Gate. He was succeeded by a male lion named Sahar, who turned four in January 2014. Another notable individual was a beloved black leopard, Marta, who was euthanized due to kidney problems in 2010. The zoo was also once known for having some of the only Asiatic lions in the United States, but these were later found to have received African-Asian hybrids.Conservation Notebook: The Asiatic Lion In 2016, The zoo announced a $30 million renovation of the habitat as part of the Pride of Chicago fundraising campaign, acknowledging the public perception problems of the historic building, and confirming that the focus would be a more naturalistic space for lions, and that tigers would not be returning in the immediate future. An exact date for the exhibit's reopening has been set. *African lion *Afghanistan leopard (formerly) *Amur leopard *Amur tiger *Cheetah (formerly) *Eurasian lynx *Jaguar *Pallas's cat *Puma *Red panda *Serval *Snow leopard *Asiatic lion (formerly) =Bear Habitat= Lincoln Park polar bearThe Robert R. McCormick Bear Habitat, or \\"Bear Line\\", sat directly next to Regenstein African Journey, and housed many carnivores over the years in a number of naturalistic exhibits with trees, water falls, rocky grottos and climbing structures for bears and wolves to use. At the north end is the 266,000-gallon polar bear pool and underwater window, one of the largest polar bear habitats in the world. The zoo received two polar bears, brother and sister Lee and Anana, in 2001, but currently only Anana remains, as Lee was sent to the Detroit Zoo to assist in a breeding program. The only other remaining member of the bear line is a single Malayan sun bear. The zoo was also home to two elderly Andean bears, Goliath and Manny that have since been sent to another zoo, as have the spotted hyenas. The exhibit used to house the maned wolf and Mexican gray wolf but both species were removed when the Pritzer Family Children's Zoo opened its own red wolf habitat in 2005. The exhibit closed in winter 2014 as work began on the new polar bear and penguin habitats over the same site. The habitat re-opened in late 2016. *Andean bear (formerly) *Spotted hyena (formerly) *Malayan sun bear (formerly) *Polar bear *Maned wolf (formerly) *Mexican gray wolf (formerly) =Penguin-Seabird Exhibit= First opened in 1982, the zoo's historic Aquatic Bird House featured two main theater-style galleries. The first featured three species of penguin - the rockhopper, chinstrap and king penguins, all in an 18,000-gallon, temperature-controlled pool, with a chilly temperature of around forty degrees Fahrenheit for the air and water, while a computer system imitates the natural daylight cycle penguins experience in the wild. The second gallery featured puffins, murres and razorbills swimming in a 10,000-gallon pool based on the North Atlantic coast, where the birds made their homes on rocky cliffs. The historic building closed on December 5, 2011, and is being replaced with Regenstein Macaque Forest. The sixty-six birds that lived in the previous exhibit were moved to eleven other locations, including the Shedd Aquarium, the St. Louis Zoo, the Detroit Zoo, the Central Park Zoo and the Oregon Coast Aquarium A new African penguin habitat was built by the current site of the Robert McCormick Bear Habitat, and opened in 2016. *Common murre (formerly) *Razorbill (formerly) *Tufted puffin (formerly) *Chinstrap penguin (formerly) *King penguin (formerly) *Rockhopper penguin (formerly) See also * List of museums and cultural institutions in Chicago Notes External links Chicago Wildlife Watch interactive public research 1868 establishments in Illinois Zoos in Illinois Tourist attractions in Chicago Articles containing video clips Zoos established in 1868 ","title":"Lincoln Park Zoo"},{"id":"716029","text":"Jif, Jiff, JIFF or JIF may refer to: Brand names * Cif, a Unilever cleaning product, branded as \\"Jif\\" in Australia, New Zealand, Middle East and the Nordic countries * Jif (lemon juice), a brand of lemon juice sold in the United Kingdom and Ireland by Unilever * Jif (peanut butter), made by the J.M.

The Palm Springs Aerial Tramway in Palm Springs, California, is the largest rotating aerial tramway in the world. It was opened in September 1963 as a way of getting from the floor of the Coachella Valley to near the top of San Jacinto Peak and was constructed in rugged Chino Canyon. Before its construction, the only way to the top of the mountain was to hike hours from Idyllwild. The rotating cars were added in 2000. Route steel truss pylon for the tramway Looking up towards the Mountain Station from the Valley Station The twelve-and-a-half minute ride begins at the Valley Station (coordinates: ) at and passes up a sheer mountain face through five life zones (biomes) on its way to the Mountain Station (coordinates: ) at above sea level. Travelers start in the Sonoran Desert and arrive at an alpine forest. The floor of the aerial tram cars rotates constantly, making two complete revolutions throughout the duration of the journey so that the passengers can see in all directions without moving. With a maximum capacity of 80 passengers, it is the largest of the three rotating aerial trams in the world. The other \\"Rotair\\" aerial trams are located in Cape Town, South Africa, and Titlis, Switzerland. Passengers disembark at the Mountain Station in the alpine wilderness of Long Valley and Mount San Jacinto State Park. The air can be as much as 40 ¬∞F (22 ¬∞C) cooler at the top than in the desert. Visitors can walk along nature trails or play in the snow during the winter months. Back- country hiking can be done with a permit from the U.S. Forest Service. There are two restaurants at the summit, one of which specializes in fine dining. Both stations have gift shops specializing in Aerial Tramway-related merchandise as well as educational toys. A video presentation of the history of the attraction plays continuously in a theater at the Mountain Station. It was produced by Palm Springs television station KESQ-TV with voiceovers provided by Palm Springs radio personalities. The view at the top can stretch northward for more than on a clear day, all the way to Mount Charleston north of Las Vegas, Nevada. Views to the east and west can stretch as far as . California's Salton Sea is plainly visible to the southeast. As it was in 1963, the only way up the mountain to deliver supplies and water is via the aerial tram cars themselves. Supplies are loaded into the passenger area before the attraction's opening while fresh water is pumped into storage tanks in the car's underbelly. One of the original aerial tram cars on static display as seen in 2007 The original aerial tram cars are now on static display near the entrance to the Valley Station.  History  Trambi: an early mascot for the Tramway The aerial tram was first proposed by electrical engineer Francis F. Crocker during a 1935 trip to Banning, California, with the Desert Sun newspaper publisher Carl Barkow. During the heat of the day, Crocker's gaze fell upon the snow-capped, peak of Mount San Jacinto to the east. Crocker then proposed building an aerial tram up the face of Chino Canyon, an idea that one newspaper dubbed \\"Crocker's Folly\\". Toward the end of the decade, Crocker named the comanager of the Palm Springs Desert Inn, O. Earl Coffman, to chair the construction committee. A view of the Coachella Valley from a tramway car. Palm Springs, the San Andreas Fault, and Interstate 10 are visible. Both World War II and the Korean War shelved the project. Construction began in 1960. The unprecedented use of helicopters in the construction of four of the aerial tram's five towers helped the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway earn a reputation as a great engineering feat. It was opened in September 1963. In 1963, a tram car became stuck for 13¬Ω hours because of an electrical problem in the control room.\\"Accidents at tramway have been few, but not far between\\" (8/27/2000), Desert Sun Newspaper On September 16, 1967, the first episode of the TV show Mannix was broadcast with the tramway as a scene in the show.TV.com: Mannix, Season 1, Episode 1, \\"The Name is Mannix\\". On October 2, 1971, an episode of Mission: Impossible (Season 6, Episode 3: \\"The Tram\\"), filmed at the tramway, first aired. In the fall of 1966, two episodes of I Spy were filmed in Palm Springs, one of which included footage of the tramway (Season 2, Episode 1), and the other included a brief discussion of the tramway (Season 2, Episode 8). The Columbo episode \\"Short Fuse\\" featured the tramway as the location of the climactic scene at the end of the show where Columbo tricks the murderer into revealing his guilt. The fourth and final Matt Helm movie, The Wrecking Crew, contained an action scene filmed at the tram station that featured actors Dean Martin, Nancy Kwan, and Sharon Tate. The 1974 television movie Skyway to Death, shown on the ABC Movie of the Week, had its exterior scenes filmed at the tramway. In the 2010 Life After People episode \\"Holiday Hell\\", the desert environment allows the tramway to survive 120 years without maintenance before it collapses into Chino Canyon from corrosion of its cables and towers. In June 1984, a tram car was headed down the mountain when a bolt from a shock absorber snapped, causing a piece of metal to crash through a Plexiglas window along the car's roof. Tram passenger Elaine Tseko of Ontario, California, was struck by the piece and later died as a result of the injury. In September 1984, during routine maintenance, an auxiliary cable snapped and wrapped around the main cable tracks. The Desert Sun newspaper reported that if the broken cable hadn't wedged itself under the main track cables, a rescue car with the tram's workmen in it could have plummeted down the mountain into the lower tramway station. \\"Without the snag,\\" a state investigator said, \\"those two men wouldn't be with us today.\\" In 1985, a flash flood buried vehicles parked in the Valley Station's parking lot in mud and tore up about three-quarters of a mile of Tramway Road. Stranded passengers had to be airlifted from the area. The interior of one of the tram cars currently in use. The floor revolves as the tram car ascends or descends the mountain. Not all Tramway accidents happened on the passenger lifts. On July 31, 1991, a bus carrying approximately 60 Girl Scouts careened out of control as it was heading downhill on Tram Road, killing the driver and six passengers. In 2000, the original tram cars were replaced by new cars that rotate slowly, offering riders a 360¬∞ panoramic view of Chino Canyon and the desert valley floor. In October 2003, a steel cable broke and caused a mechanical failure that left more than fifty tramway customers hanging in mid-air and one hundred passengers stranded at the Mountain station for 4¬Ω hours. During the crisis, tramway officials sought a rescue helicopter but could not locate one.\\"Tramway sought help of helicopter in vain\\". (10/10/2003), Riverside Press-Enterprise Newspaper The obstruction was removed by a tram operator with no training in maintenance, utilizing a borrowed Leatherman utility knife. The Desert Sun later reported that a cable inspector had discovered a break in the rescue line almost two hours before the incident occurred.\\"Tramway line break found two hours before mishap\\" (10/15/2003), Desert Sun Newspaper  Animal park  In the late 1960s, the Tramway Animal Park, now defunct, was owned and operated by Animal Behavior Laboratories of Los Angeles. It was located on of land leased from the Mt. San Jacinto Winter Park Authority. A portion of the park included a fenced area for reindeer that were allowed to roam throughout Chino Canyon. In addition to reindeer, the park featured tame deer, cockatoos, two dolphins named Buttons and Beau, macaques, and various other species of primates (including \\"Suzie, the show-off chimpanzee\\"). The animals performed in regularly scheduled shows.\\"Tramway with a Porpoise\\", Desert Magazine  Station architecture  Valley Station, the lower of the tramway's two stations Both tramway stations were designed by notable mid-century modern architects.

Use in some countries, such as the U.S., continued into the 1950s. Thorium compounds produce excellent images because of thorium's high opacity to X-rays (it has a high cross section for absorption). However, thorium is retained in the body, and it is radioactive, emitting harmful alpha radiation as it decays. Because the suspension offered high image quality and had virtually no immediate side- effects compared to the alternatives available at the time, Thorotrast became widely used after its introduction in 1931. Ant√≥nio Egas Moniz contributed to its development. About 2 to 10 million patients worldwide have been treated with Thorotrast. However, today it has shown an increase risk in certain cancers such as cholangiocarcinomas, angiosarcomas, hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatic fibrosis of the liver. Safety Even at the time of introduction, there was concern about the safety of Thorotrast. Following injection, the drug is distributed to the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone, where it is absorbed. After this initial absorption, redistribution takes place at a very slow pace. Specifically, the biological half-life is estimated to be 22 years. This means that the organs of patients who have been given Thorotrast will be exposed to internal alpha radiation for the rest of their lives. The significance of this long-term exposure was not fully understood at the time of Thorotrast's introduction in 1931. Due to the release of alpha particles, Thorotrast was found to be extremely carcinogenic. There is a high over-incidence of various cancers in patients who have been treated with Thorotrast. The cancers occur some years (usually 20‚Äì30) after injection of Thorotrast. The risk of developing liver cancer (or bile duct cancer) in former Thorotrast patients has been measured to be well above 100 times the risk of the rest of the population. The risk of leukemia appears to be 20 times higher in Thorotrast patients. Thorotrast exposure has also been associated with the development of angiosarcoma. German patients exposed to Thorotrast had their median life-expectancy shortened by 14 years in comparison to a similar non-exposed control group. Thorium is no longer used in X-ray contrast agents. Today, iodinated hydrophilic (water-soluble) molecules are universally used as injected contrast agents in X-ray procedures. The Danish director Nils Malmros's movie, Facing the Truth (original Danish title At Kende Sandheden) from 2002, portrays the dilemma that faced Malmros's father, Richard Malmros, when treating his patients in the 1940s. Richard Malmros was deeply concerned about the persistence of Thorotrast in the body but was forced to use Thorotrast, because the only available alternative (per-abrodil) had serious immediate side-effects, suffered from image quality problems and was difficult to obtain during the Second World War. The use of Thorotrast in Denmark ended in 1947 when safer alternatives became available. Current use Thorotrast has also been used in research to stain neural tissue samples for examination by historadiography.

Early life and career  Born in Colchester, Essex, he graduated from St Luke's College, Exeter (in which George Reader had been taught just after the First World War, and which Sir Stanley Rous had also attended). He qualified as a referee in 1936, working his way through the leagues becoming a Football League linesman in the 1949-50 season, and becoming a League referee. In the Second World War he was rejected by the Royal Air Force because of an injured ankle, and subsequently joined the Royal Artillery before transferring to the British Indian Army, where he finished the war with the rank of lieutenant-colonel and served on the Changi War Crimes Tribunal.  Refereeing  On his return from military service in 1946, Aston became the first League referee to wear the black uniform with white trim which became the standard for referees. Up to that point, referees wore tweed jackets over white shirts with French cuffs, and pants akin to golf knickers. He later explained that when he spied a black flight jacket in the window of a war surplus store, he was delighted with the wonderful assortment of pockets. He immediately bought a couple of the jackets, thinking the pockets would serve him well as a referee. He changed to black knickers, kept the white shirt, and wore the new black flight jacket, creating the black uniform with the apparent white \\"trim.\\" The following year (1947), he introduced brightly coloured linesman's flags, one yellow and one red, in place of those provided by the home team, in the home team's colours, which had traditionally been used. He explained that he was doing a game in the midst of a foggy London day. He said that the colours of the home team were beige and chocolate, colours he was unable to see in the fog. He explained that he went to war surplus store on the way home, purchased a pair of red and yellow rain slickers and made a set of brightly coloured flags, which he used thereafter, and was never troubled by fog again. In 1953 he became Head Teacher at Newbury Park Primary School in Ilford, Essex, and progressed to refereeing senior League matches. Aston taught many courses, including a series that was recorded for novice referees. He called the series, \\"Refereeing is thinking.\\" Aston refereed the 1963 FA Cup Final and the Battle of Santiago, the match between Chile and Italy in the 1962 World Cup.  FIFA Referees' Committee  Aston did not referee any more games either in the 1962 tournament (having strained his Achilles Tendon), or in later World Cups. He was, however, appointed to the FIFA Referees' Committee for eight years, chairing it for four. He was in charge of all referees for the 1966, 1970, and 1974 World Cups. In 1966 Aston also introduced the practice of naming a substitute referee who could take over in the case of the referee being unable to continue for any reason (this eventually evolved into the practice of having a designated fourth official). He also successfully proposed that the pressure of the ball should be specified in the Laws of the Game. In 1974, he introduced the number board for substitutes, so that players could easily understand who was being substituted.  Red and yellow cards  Following an incident in the England vs Argentina match in the 1966 World Cup, it came to Aston's knowledge that Jack Charlton had been booked by the German referee, Rudolf Kreitlein. Charlton called the press office, where Aston was ensconced (as Head of World Cup Referees), in order to confirm the information that he had read within the newspaper that Kreitlein had booked him. Aston, driving from Wembley Stadium to Lancaster Gate that same evening, had Charlton's confusion in mind during the journey. On the trip, as he stopped at a traffic light junction at Kensington High Street, Aston realised that a colour-coding scheme based on the same amber/yellow ('stop if safe to do so') - red (Stop) principle as used on traffic lights would traverse language barriers and clarify to players and spectators that they had been cautioned or sent off.Refereeing Aston later explained that upon arriving at his home, he explained the dilemma to his wife, Hilda. She disappeared into the other room, only to return a few minutes later with two \\"cards\\" made of construction paper. She had cut them to fit into his shirt pocket. Thus was devised the system whereby referees show a yellow card for a caution and a red card for an expulsion, which was first used in the 1970 World Cup. These cards have also been adopted ‚Äì with appropriate differences depending on the rules ‚Äì in many other sports too.  Later career  Aston became senior lecturer of the Football Association Referees' Panel and Chief Instructor for the American Youth Soccer Organization (AYSO), a position he held for 21 years. In 1997, he was awarded the MBE. The Ken Aston Camp is held annually in Orange, CA. The camp honours Ken's commitment to service and excellence. The Ken Aston Cup, was an annual competition to recognise skilled referees in AYSO. The tournament was held annually in southern California. After a multi-year hiatus, it is scheduled to be held in Costa Mesa, California in March 2020. As long as they were able, Aston and his wife Hilda were the guests of honour on the fields at the camp and competition. Ken taught at the camp and they drove around the tournament in a golf cart, observing, chatting, and making new friends. Their golf cart carried a Union Jack, making them easy to locate.

It differs from a street address, in that each address may have several delivery points, such as an apartment, office department, or other room. Such buildings (primarily residential) are often called multiple-dwelling units (MDUs) by the USPS. United States Postal Service usage In the US Postal System, a delivery point is a specific set of digits between 00 and 99 assigned to every address. When combined with the ZIP + 4 code, the delivery point provides a unique identifier for every deliverable address served by the USPS. The delivery point digits are almost never printed on mail in human-readable form; instead they are encoded in the POSTNET delivery point barcode (DPBC) or as part of the newer Intelligent Mail Barcode (IMB). The DPBC makes automated mail sorting possible, including ordering the mail according to how the carrier delivers it (walk sequence). The two-digit delivery point number is combined with an additional check digit in the DPBC. This digit is used by barcode sorters (BCS) to check if the ZIP, ZIP + 4, or delivery point ZIP codes contain an error. In a database, storing the ZIP + 4 code in a 10 character field (with the hyphen) allows easy output in the address block, and storing the check digit in a 3-digit field (instead of calculating it) allows automatic checking of the validity of the ZIP+4 and delivery point fields in case one had been changed independently. In order to receive the appropriate barcode discount, the delivery point digits and the +4 extension must be verified using an up-to-date, CASS or DPV certified program. Since each city block or section of a rural route has a different +4 extension, and address numbers generally increase by 100 per block, the delivery point is typically the last two digits of the address. In the early days of DPBC, it was acceptable to determine the delivery point in this fashion, but since suite and other secondary designations are assigned unique delivery points which cannot be determined without the CASS/DPV database, this is no longer possible. The delivery point is usually redundant for post office boxes, since they are typically assigned their own ZIP + 4 code, but must nonetheless be assigned a complete DPBC for full postal discounts. The full rules for identifying the delivery point for a given address are specified in the USPS CASS Technical Guide. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom the delivery point index is known as the Postcode Address File (PAF). It is owned and made available by Royal Mail. New Zealand Post New Zealand Post maintains an index of delivery points known as the National Postal Address Database (NPAD). Australia Post In Australia the PAF is maintained by Australia Post.

In 1978, in advance of the founding of the bank, the Greek government granted an exemption to its usual prohibition on foreign banks owning more than 40 per cent of the equity of a Greek bank. This permitted several Arab banks to establish Arab-Hellenic Bank with 49 per cent Arab ownership. The bank was founded in 1979, with Vassilis Sarantitis, an influential lawyer and for many years chairman of the Arab-Hellenic Chamber of Commerce, as one of the founders. Ownership was 51% National Bank of Greece, 20% Kuwait Investment Office, 20% Libyan Arab Foreign Bank (a Libyan institution), and 9% other Arab investors. As the bank was undercapitalized and the central bank of the country demanded serious capital increase, in 1993 the Libyan Arab Foreign Bank proposed a cash infusion that would take its ownership to 72%, given the other shareholders' reluctance to participate. The plan was to take advantage of the EU \\"single passport\\" rules, which would permit Arab Hellenic to open branches in London and elsewhere in the EU, while subject only to Bank of Greece supervision.

Overhiser's School in Brooklyn. He studied at Columbia University from 1870 to 1872, then at Amherst College from 1873 to 1875, where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa in the class of 1875. He earned his M.A. from Amherst in 1878. He was awarded an honorary degree from Washington and Jefferson College in 1888. Todd worked at the US Naval Observatory from 1875 to 1878, and at the US Nautical Almanac Office from 1878 to 1881. From 1881 to 1917 he was a professor of astronomy and director of the observatory at Amherst College, and from 1917 onward he was professor emeritus there. From 1882 to 1887, he was also a professor of astronomy and higher mathematics at nearby Smith College. He married Mabel Loomis on March 5, 1879, and had one daughter, Millicent. His wife had had an affair with William Austin Dickinson, the (married) brother of Emily Dickinson. The affair was an open secret in Amherst, and David Todd seems to have accepted it willingly. A collection of the two lovers' letters were published in Austin and Mabel: The Amherst Affair & Love Letters of Austin Dickinson and Mabel Loomis Todd (). Astronomical and other accomplishments Todd designed and erected several observatories, including those at Smith College from 1886 to 1888 and at Amherst College from 1903 to 1906.

A graduate of the University of Melbourne, where he earned Master of Arts and Master of Laws degrees, McCay established a successful legal practice, McCay & Thwaites. He was a member of the Victorian Parliament for Castlemaine from 1895 to 1899, where he was a champion of women's suffrage and federation. He lost his seat in 1899 but became a member of the first Australian Federal Parliament in 1901. He was Minister for Defence from 1904 to 1905, during which he implemented long-lasting reforms, including the creation of the Military Board. As a soldier, McCay commanded the 2nd Infantry Brigade in the landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, during the Gallipoli Campaign of the Great War. He was later wounded in the Second Battle of Krithia and invalided to Australia, but returned to command the 5th Division, which he led in the Battle of Fromelles in 1916, dubbed \\"the worst 24 hours in Australia's entire history.\\" His failures in difficult military operations made him a controversial figure who earned the disfavour of his superiors, while his efforts to succeed in the face of insurmountable obstacles earned him the odium of troops under his command, who blamed him for high casualties. In the latter part of the war he commanded the AIF Depots in the United Kingdom. After the war, McCay resumed his old job as Deputy Chairman of the State Bank of Victoria and also served on a panel that deliberated on the future structure of the Army. He was chairman of the Fair Profits Commission, the War Service Homes Scheme of the Repatriation Commission, and the Repatriation Commission's Disposals Board. He commanded the Special Constabulary Force during the 1923 Victorian Police strike. Education and early life McCay was born on 21 December 1864 in Ballynure, County Antrim, Ireland, the oldest of ten children to the Reverend Andrew Ross Boyd McCay, a Presbyterian minister, and his wife Lily Ann Esther Waring (n√©e Brown). The family emigrated to Australia in 1865, settling in Castlemaine, Victoria. Boyd McCay continued his theological studies while he was a minister in Castlemaine, earning a Master of Arts (MA) from the University of Melbourne in 1882 and a Doctor of Divinity from the Presbyterian Theological Faculty Ireland in 1887. Esther could speak seven languages. The two separated in 1891. James attended Castlemaine State School. At the age of twelve he won a scholarship to Scotch College, Melbourne to the value of ¬£35 per annum for six years. He was dux of the school in 1880. At Scotch College McCay first met John Monash, who would be dux the following year, and would later become a close friend. McCay entered Ormond College at the University of Melbourne in 1881, the year that the college first opened, and commenced studying for his Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. McCay left the university without completing his degree in 1883 and took a job as a teacher at Toorak Grammar School. In 1885, he bought Castlemaine Grammar School. The school was co-educational; McCay believed that girls should have the same opportunities as boys. Among its students who attended university with McCay's encouragement and support was Sussanah Jane Williams, who later became principal of Janet Clarke Hall at the University of Melbourne, and The Women's College at the University of Sydney. The job of running the school was soon delegated to McCay's mother and brother Adam. He returned to the university in 1892 and completed his Bachelor of Arts degree. He then embarked on a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) degree. In 1895, he was awarded an MA degree, majoring in mathematics. He completed his law degree the next year, with first class honours, in spite of rarely attending the lectures due to his work, political and military commitments. In 1895, he was admitted as a barrister and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Victoria and established a legal practice in Castlemaine. His practice had the first telephone in the town. He was awarded his Master of Laws (LLM) degree in 1897. In 1898, he went into partnership with William Thwaites, whose brother Walter married his sister. The firm's name was then changed to McCay & Thwaites. It would later hire one of the first women to become an articled clerk in Victoria. On 8 April 1896, McCay married Julia Mary O'Meara, the daughter of a Roman Catholic Kyneton police magistrate. Sectarianism in Australia made such marriages uncommon, and the marriage was opposed by both their families. It produced two daughters, Margaret Mary (\\"Mardi\\") and Beatrix Waring (\\"Bixie\\"), born in 1897 and 1901, respectively. Political career Undated photo Victorian parliament In August 1890, McCay was elected to the local council of the Castlemaine Borough. When the prominent local Member of the Legislative Assembly, Sir James Patterson, died in 1894, McCay ran for his seat of Castlemaine in the resulting by-election. After a hard-fought campaign, McCay won by just ten votes. McCay devoted his maiden speech to what would be his defining cause as a state politician, women's suffrage: On other issues, McCay supported Federation, and was one of a number of young politicians who rallied around Alfred Deakin, threatening to bring down Sir George Turner's government if it attempted to block federation. McCay opposed sending Victorian troops to fight in the Boer War, calling war in general an \\"anachronism\\". In 1899, McCay was one of the young radicals who supported Allan McLean and crossed the floor to bring down the Turner government. McLean gave McCay the portfolio of Minister for Education and Customs in his new ministry. At the time it was the custom for members who had accepted a ministerial appointment to re-submit themselves for election. In the subsequent by-election, McCay's opposition to the war in South Africa became an election issue. The war was now going badly for Britain. Feelings ran high and McCay lost his seat. McCay attempted to win his seat back at the general election in 1900 but lost again. Federal parliament With Federation in 1901 came the opportunity to run for the new Parliament of Australia. McCay contested the 1901 election as a Protectionist Party candidate for Corinella, the Federal electorate that encompassed the Castlemaine area. McCay, who characterised himself as a liberal, supported the widest possible enfranchisement of women, the protection of industry and revenue through tariffs, and the White Australia policy. The war in South Africa was now in its final stages and the electorate forgot or forgave McCay's \\"treason\\", electing him to the first Australian Parliament. J. C. Hoad; Lieutenant Colonel J. W. McCay; Colonel W. T. Bridges, Mr J. A. Thompson. As a backbencher, McCay opposed amendments to the Defence Act 1903 proposed by Billy Hughes of the Australian Labor Party that called for peacetime conscription. He accepted its necessity in wartime, but only for service within Australia. McCay believed that volunteers would always be plentiful, and he feared that peacetime conscription would result in militarism. He was re-elected unopposed in the 1903 election, the first in which Victorian women were eligible to vote. In 1904, McCay moved an amendment to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 to remove the clause that empowered the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration to give preference to trade unions. The debate became unexpectedly heated and resulted in the fall of Chris Watson's Labor government. The Free Trade Party's George Reid became Prime Minister and offered McCay the post of Minister for Defence. McCay became the sixth Minister for Defence in four years. His predecessor, Senator Anderson Dawson, had chaired a committee that had produced a detailed report recommending the abolition of the post of General Officer Commanding Australian Military Forces and the creation of a Council of Defence, a Naval Board and a Military Board. It fell to McCay to implement the report's recommendations and create a five-man Military Board consisting of himself, a finance member and three military officers. McCay preferred the senior member not be styled the Chief of the General Staff. This change would not be made until 1909. At the first meeting of the Council of Defence, McCay rejected the arguments of Captain William Rooke Creswell for the majority of the defence budget to be spent on supporting the British fleet. In 1905 the Reid government collapsed and McCay became a backbencher once more. Since the Federal parliament sat in Parliament House, Melbourne, McCay lived at the Stock Exchange Club in Collins Street, Melbourne while his family remained in Castlemaine. He maintained a liaison with a married woman, Ella Gavan Duffy. In the 1906 redistribution, McCay's electorate of Corinella was abolished and its territory divided between the electorates of Laanecoorie and Corio. McCay decided to run in Corio against the sitting member, Richard Crouch, although he was also a Protectionist, but Crouch won convincingly. In 1910, the Commonwealth Liberal Party Senate candidate, Thomas Skene, died suddenly two days before the nomination date for the 1910 election. McCay submitted himself as candidate but lost. Military career McCay's military career began in 1884, when he enlisted in the 4th (Castlemaine) Battalion, Victorian Rifles. He was commissioned as a lieutenant on 29 October 1886, and was subsequently promoted to captain on 5 March 1889 and major on 13 March 1896. Following the forced resignation of the commander of the 8th Regiment for making a political speech touting McCay, McCay was promoted to lieutenant colonel and assumed command of the regiment on 12 January 1900. Director of Military Intelligence On 6 December 1907, on the recommendation of the Chief of Intelligence, Colonel William Throsby Bridges, the Minister for Defence, Thomas Ewing appointed McCay as Director of Military Intelligence, with the rank of colonel. In turn, McCay turned to his former schoolmate, John Monash, whom he had appointed to the command of the Victorian section of the new Australian Army Intelligence Corps (AIC), with a promotion to the rank of lieutenant colonel on 28 March 1908. The AIC set about compiling information such as the suitability of lighthouses for signalling, the availability of railway rolling stock, and the number of civilian motor vehicles suitable for military use. A concerted effort was put into creating sets of detailed maps. McCay and Monash became close friends. In 1912, McCay & Thwaites moved into offices at 360 Collins Street, where businesses associated with the Baillieu family were located. Monash moved his offices into the same building, and the two addressed each other as \\"Jack\\" and \\"Jim\\". On 5 March 1912, McCay was appointed a commissioner of the State Bank of Victoria. In 1911, McCay delivered a lecture at the Victorian United Services Institution entitled \\"The True Principles of Australia's Defence\\". He suggested that the Australian Army should be equipped to the same standard as the British Army and should be prepared to fight an enemy overseas rather than waiting for an invasion of Australia. On 11 April 1913, he resigned his position as Director of Military Intelligence and was placed on the unattached list. Great War =Gallipoli= On 2 August 1914, the government activated the preliminary stage of the war plan, which included the establishment of censorship. McCay was recalled to duty as Deputy Chief Censor (Australia), answerable to the Chief Censor in London. McCay organised a headquarters in Melbourne, and established district offices in the other state capitals. Soon after the outbreak of the Great War on 4 August, Bridges, now a brigadier general, appointed McCay to command the 2nd Infantry Brigade of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). He was succeeded by Lieutenant Colonel W. H. Tunbridge on 10 August, who in turn was succeeded by Colonel Monash on 17 August.

In the centre of the photo is SS Novian carrying the headquarters of the 2nd Infantry Brigade. At the right is the SS Galeka from which the brigade's 6th and 7th Infantry Battalions have been landing. McCay was assigned two regular officers as his brigade major and staff captain, but was permitted to choose his four battalion commanders. All of McCay's choices were senior Militia commanders from Victoria. Three of them proved to be too old for the vigours of a modern campaign. The exception was his youngest appointment, Lieutenant Colonel Harold Edward Elliott of the 7th Infantry Battalion, a University of Melbourne educated lawyer like himself. The brigade assembled at Broadmeadows Camp where it commenced its training. On 21 October McCay and his brigade headquarters embarked from Melbourne on the former P&O; ocean liner RMS Orvieto, which also carried Major General Bridges and the staff of his 1st Division. After sailing through the Suez Canal, it arrived at Alexandria, Egypt on 4 December 1914. The brigade camped at Mena, on the outskirts of Cairo, where training resumed. War correspondent Charles Bean noted that McCay \\"trained his command with conspicuous ability. He did a great deal of detail work himself, drawing his own orders, and sometimes training his own platoons.\\" On 4 April 1915, the 2nd Brigade packed its camp and moved by rail to Alexandria, from whence it embarked for Gallipoli for the landing at Anzac Cove. McCay arrived off Anzac Cove on the transport SS Novian on the morning of Anzac Day, 25 April 1915, with his headquarters and the 5th Infantry Battalion on board. Novian had difficulties reaching her berth and when she finally reached it there were no boats to unload her. McCay therefore did not step ashore until about 06:00. There, he met Colonel Ewen Sinclair- Maclagan, the commander of the 3rd Infantry Brigade, who asked him to deploy the 2nd Infantry Brigade on the right, on the 400 Plateau, instead of the left as planned. McCay did so, establishing his headquarters on what became known as McCay's Hill. The 2nd Infantry Brigade was soon involved in \\"the most costly struggle of the day\\". At 16:45 McCay telephoned Bridges at 1st Division headquarters to ask for reinforcements. The Australian line was forced back on to the reverse slope, but did not break. The commander of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, General Sir Ian Hamilton, now decided to make his main effort at Cape Helles. The Australian and New Zealand Army Corps commander, Lieutenant General Sir William Birdwood, was ordered to send a brigade from each of his two divisions to Helles to reinforce the British and French troops there. McCay's brigade and the New Zealand Infantry Brigade were chosen. They embarked for Helles on 6 May. On the evening of 8 May, during the Second Battle of Krithia, McCay was given 35 minutes notice to conduct an advance across open ground in broad daylight. McCay protested that there was insufficient time to organise this but was overruled by Hamilton. The brigade suffered heavily. McCay led his men from the front, driving them on despite the futility of the attack. All of his staff were killed or wounded, and McCay's leg was broken by a bullet. The advance was also pointless, for it could have been conducted after dark without loss. As a result, his men regarded him as responsible for their fate. McCay was evacuated to hospital in Alexandria. He rejoined his brigade at Anzac on 8 June but the wound had not fully healed and he was lame, walking with the aid of a stick. In the meantime, General Bridges had been mortally wounded on 18 May and the Australian government sent the Chief of the General Staff, Major General James Gordon Legge, to replace him as commander of the 1st Division. McCay, Monash and Colonel Harry Chauvel were all disappointed at being passed over for the command, and protested to Birdwood and the Australian government, but to no avail. However, Legge chose McCay to command the 2nd Division, then forming in Egypt. Unfortunately, on 11 July, the day before he was due to leave for Egypt, McCay's leg snapped where the bone had been broken at Krithia. He was evacuated again, this time to Malta, and then to the United Kingdom, where he was visited by Sir George Reid, now the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. McCay's wife Julia died while he was in hospital. Several weeks later his father died as well. McCay was therefore sent back to Australia on compassionate leave. He arrived back in Melbourne on RMS Malwa on 11 November 1915, accompanied by his two teenage daughters and his brother Hugh, who had joined the ship in Adelaide, to a hero's welcome. For his service at Gallipoli, McCay was mentioned in despatches for his \\"great promptitude in supporting the threatened flank of the covering force\\" during the landing and his \\"conspicuous gallantry\\" at Krithia. He was also appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath, and bestowed the Croix de Commander de la L√©gion d'honneur by the President of France. =Western Front= The Minister for Defence, Senator George Pearce, appointed McCay to the newly created post of Inspector General of the AIF on 29 November 1915, with the local rank of major general. McCay was involved in recruiting campaigns, and inspected AIF units and reported on their training and equipment. He proposed a new training regime, with a national syllabus that increased the number of hours per week of training and the duration of training to twelve weeks. This led to strikes at the camps at Casula and Liverpool. Rioting soldiers clashed with police at Circular Quay and at Central Station striking soldiers were shot and one killed by soldiers sent to return them to Liverpool. As a result, new liquor laws were introduced, including six o'clock closing. Meanwhile, the Gallipoli Campaign had ended and the AIF in Egypt was in the process of doubling in size from two divisions to four. Birdwood wished to appoint two British generals to command the new divisions, but Senator Pearce opposed this, ordering that one be given to McCay. On 22 March 1916, McCay arrived back in Egypt to assume command of the 5th Division. He found that General Headquarters, Egyptian Expeditionary Force had ordered II Anzac Corps, of which the 5th Division was a part, to replace I Anzac Corps in the defence of the Suez Canal. Owing to a shortage of rolling stock, the 4th and 5th Divisions were ordered to undertake a three-day route march across the desert under service conditions, carrying their packs and weapons. This proved to be a greater test of staff and troops than anticipated, and many men dropped from thirst or exhaustion. Many of his men blamed McCay for subjecting them to such a humiliating and severe trial. In June 1916, the 5th Division moved to the Western Front. Although the last to arrive in France, it would be the first to see serious action, a part of an ill-conceived plan by Lieutenant General Sir Richard Haking, whose British XI Corps would attack a strong part of the line with inexperienced 5th Division and British 61st (2nd South Midland) Division. The resulting Battle of Fromelles was an unmitigated disaster. In one night, the 5th Division sustained 5,533 casualties, while the 61st Division lost 1,547. Haking was principally responsible but McCay bore some of the blame. He made tactical errors; his order to vacate the first trench after it was cleared \\"undoubtedly contributed to the causes of failure\\". His refusal to permit a truce to recover wounded further damaged his popularity. For his part, McCay was mentioned in despatches a second time. The 5th Division was out of action for some months. It finally moved with the rest of the I Anzac Corps to the Somme sector in October. After months of fighting and recent rain, the front line area was a devastated muddy morass. McCay was ordered to undertake an attack with the 2nd Division's 7th Infantry Brigade at Flers, which cost 819 casualties and gained no ground. Once again, McCay's handling of his division showed poor planning and tactics. Moreover, at Flers he showed that he had not learned from the lessons of Fromelles. His relief was now only a matter of time. Nonetheless, McCay remained in command of the 5th Division until 18 December 1916 when he was granted medical leave in the United Kingdom for treatment on his leg, which the doctors diagnosed as neuralgia. Birdwood took the opportunity of removing McCay, ostensibly on medical grounds. McCay was mentioned in despatches a third time. =United Kingdom= alt=Two- storey brick house with bay window and two large chimneys. On the recommendation of Brigadier General Robert Anderson, the Commandant, Administrative Headquarters, AIF, and against the opposition of Birdwood, Senator Pearce appointed McCay as commander of the AIF Depots in the United Kingdom. These depots received and trained reinforcements arriving from Australia, and rehabilitated and retrained convalescents who were released from hospital. McCay established his headquarters at Tidworth, in the heart of the Salisbury Plain where most of the Australian camps were located. He occupied this post for the remainder of the war, failing in bids to return to an active command at the head of the 5th Division, the Australian Corps, or the 3rd Division when Monash was promoted to corps commander. A bid to replace Birdwood as administrative commander of the AIF also came to naught. For his services in the United Kingdom, McCay was mentioned in despatches a fourth time, made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1918, and a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1919. On 10 March 1919, McCay handed over command of the AIF Depots in the United Kingdom to Major General Charles Rosenthal. After a farewell dinner hosted by Monash, he embarked for Australia, where his AIF appointment was terminated. In 1919, along with George Swinburne and Generals White and Legge, he produced a report on the organisation of the post-war Army. In 1920, he joined Generals Chauvel, White, Monash, Legge, and Hobbs to produce a second report on the subject. McCay retired from the Army in 1926 with the honorary rank of lieutenant general. Later life McCay resumed his old job as Deputy Chairman of the State Savings Bank of Victoria on 10 June 1919, a few days after he returned to Melbourne. He also resumed his relationship with Ella Gavan Duffy. On 30 December 1919, the Premier of Victoria, Harry Lawson, McCay's successor in Legislative Assembly seat of Castlemaine and a former student at Castlemaine Grammar and Scotch College, appointed McCay as chairman of the Fair Profits Commission, a consumer protection body set up to monitor prices and profits. After his term ended in 1921, he was appointed to the advisory board of the War Service Homes Scheme of the Repatriation Commission. He was also Chairman of its Disposals Board from 1921 to 1922. In 1922, the State Savings Bank of Victoria took over the construction of war service homes in Victoria. During the 1923 Victorian Police strike, Monash appointed McCay to create, and later command the Special Constabulary Force that was established to carry out police duties during the strike. McCay ran this organisation from the Melbourne Town Hall, and later the Repatriation Department offices, which were made available rent free by the Commonwealth Government. The Special Constabulary Force was wound up in May 1924. McCay's daughter Mardi matriculated from Sacr√© C≈ìur School in 1914 and earned Master of Arts and Diploma of Education degrees from the University of Melbourne. In 1922, she entered the Society of the Sacred Heart. She taught at Convent of the Sacred Heart, Rose Bay in Sydney (now Kincoppal-Rose Bay) until 1956 when she returned to Sacr√© C≈ìur as Mistress of Studies. Bixie also attended Sacr√© C≈ìur and the University of Melbourne, at Janet Clarke Hall, where she became only the third woman in Victoria to earn a Master of Laws degree, and was enrolled as a barrister on 10 June 1925. Like Joan Rosanove, she could not obtain room in the Selborne Chambers, as women were not allowed to do so, so she put up her plate in the building next door. McCay followed his daughter and became a barrister, enrolling on 8 October 1925. In 1930, she married George Reid, a young barrister who later became Attorney-General of Victoria. McCay became ill in 1930 with cancer. In his last months he destroyed all his papers. He died on 12 October 1930. He was survived by his daughters, now Reverend Mother McCay and Mrs George Reid, and six brothers and two sisters. He was given, at his request, a non-military funeral at Cairns Memorial Presbyterian Church in East Melbourne, and was buried at Box Hill Cemetery. For pallbearers he had Generals John Monash, Harold Edward Elliott, Cecil Henry Foott, R. E. Williams, and J. Stanley, along with Sir William McBeath, the chairman of the State Savings Bank; William Thwaites, his law partner; and businessman A. S. Baillieu. Among the other mourners was Generals Brudenell White and John Patrick McGlinn, who had been his deputy commander of AIF Depots in the United Kingdom; John Latham, the Leader of the Opposition; Dr W. S. Littlejohn, the headmaster of Scotch College and Sir John MacFarland, the Chancellor of the University of Melbourne. Legacy McCay is a controversial figure in Australian history. Disagreement about his significance and reputation began before his death and continues to the present. General Sir Brudenell White considered McCay to be \\"one of the greatest soldiers that ever served Australia, greater even than Monash.\\" McCay's achievements included the creation of the Military Board and the Australian Army Intelligence Corps, and the development of the Staff Corps, \\"laying the foundations on which the Australian Army was built.\\" In writing Volume III of the Official History of Australia in the War of 1914‚Äì1918, which covered 1916, official historian Charles Bean exonerated McCay of blame for Fromelles. This led to a public debate in the pages of The Bulletin in 1929 between critics of McCay and his defenders, led by Elliott. A revival of interest in Australian military history and the rediscovery of graves at Fromelles in the 21st Century led to a number of books being written about the battle, which tended to be critical of McCay.

When passports first emerged, there was no clear distinction between internal and international ones. Later, some countries developed sophisticated systems of passports for various purposes and various groups of population. Uses for internal passports have included restricting citizens of a subdivided state to employment in their own area (preventing their migration to richer cities or regions), clearly recording the ethnicity of citizens to enforce segregation or prevent passing, and controlling access to sensitive sites or closed cities. Currently, only the Russian Federation is known to still have internal passports as a part of their bureaucratic heritage, though it is no longer used to restrict the movement of people: a Russian internal passport is essentially an identification document in the form of a booklet.

Ukraine Today. July 10, 2015. Terminology In many countries, the word \\"passport\\" is only used in modern language to denote a document issued for the purpose of international travel, which is subject to discretionary permission. However, in post-Soviet countries, the word \\"passport\\" is implied to merely mean a primary identification document, especially if has the form of a booklet. Nevertheless, it is also extended by analogy to other forms of identification documents. For example, Ukrainian identity cards that are replacing old-fashioned internal passport booklets are still called passports.ID card of the citizen of Ukraine Types of internal passports Canada In 1885 the \\"pass system\\" was introduced in Canada, to restrict and control the movement of First Nations people within Canada. Instituted at the time of the North-West Rebellion, it remained in force for 60 years despite having no basis in law. Any First Nation person caught outside his Indian reserve without a pass issued by an Indian agent was returned to the reserve or incarcerated. France In France, in the past, one had to show an internal passport to change city. Former convicts who had served forced labour, even after having served their sentence, had a yellow passport, which made them outcasts. A famous holder of the yellow passport is the former ' Jean Valjean the hero of the novel by Victor Hugo.Victor Hugo, ' A d√©cret issued 2 October 1795 (10 Vend√©miaire year IV in the French Republican Calendar) required all persons traveling outside the limits of their canton to possess either an internal passport (for voyages within France) or external passport (for travel outside France). In 1815 an internal passport cost 2 francs and was delivered by the mayor of the commune to the residence of the passport requester. Internal passports were significantly easier to obtain than passports for foreign travel, which cost 10 francs in 1815. In the early 19th century, many emigrants obtained cheaper and easier- to-obtain internal passports to travel to the port of Havre, from which most ships to the United States departed. As control of the issuance of internal passports, which required a certificate of good behavior, was in the hands of the mayors of communes, there was some degree of favoritism in the issuance/denial of internal passports in the 18th century. Internal passports were finally abolished in France in 1862. =Booklet and notebook of circulation of travellers= In France, the \\"livret de circulation\\" (booklet of circulation) and its variant the \\"carnet de circulation\\" (notebook of circulation) provided to those of no fixed abode were particularly constraining and discriminatory obligations imposed on itinerants. At the end of 2012, when examining a , the Constitutional Council ended the notebook of circulation, considering that it harmed disproportionately the freedom of movement. South Africa In South Africa, the pass laws (notably the Pass Laws Act 1952, which applied until 1986) were a component of the apartheid system. The laws regulated where, when and for how long persons could remain outside their ‚Äúhomeland‚Äù ‚Äî which, for many people, was not their homeland, so thousands of autochthon people were forced to change region. These laws also made it compulsory for all black South Africans over the age of 15 to carry a pass book at all times. However, the legislation also required that citizens of all races have on their person an ID book, which closely approximates a passport. Soviet Union and its successors Pages of internal passport, issued in 1910 in Imperial Russia The internal passport system of the Russian Empire was abandoned after the October Revolution in 1917, lifting most limitations upon internal movements of members of labouring classes in Soviet Russia. Labour booklets became the principal means of personal identification. In 1932, the \\"passport regime\\" was reintroduced, its declared purpose to improve the registration of population and \\"relieve\\" major industrial cities and other sensitive localities of \\"hiding kulaks and dangerous political elements\\" and those \\"not engaged in labor of social usefulness\\". The \\"passportization\\" process developed gradually involving factories, large, medium, and small cities, settlements, and rural areas, and finally became universal by the mid-1970s. Internal passports were used in the Soviet Union for identification of persons for various purposes. In particular, passports were used to control and monitor the place of residence by means of the propiska, a regulation designed to control the population's internal movement by binding a person to his or her permanent place of residence. For example, a valid propiska was necessary to receive higher education or medical treatment, although these services were not limited to the location registered. Besides marriage to a resident of another area, university education was the most popular way of circumventing one's propiska and residing elsewhere. Also, since only a minority of dwellings were privately owned, having a propiska at a certain address meant that one had the right to live there. All residents were required by law to record their address in the document and to report any relevant changes to a local office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. For example, citizens needed to submit photographs of themselves for their passport, taken when they were issued the document at age 16, and again at ages 25 and 45. Formally, passports were not necessary for traveling per se in late Soviet Union. Bus, train, and air tickets were sold without names, and identification documents were not necessary for boarding buses and trains (and only became necessary to board a plane in the mid-1970s) except when traveling to/from border-adjacent areas and controlled cities. Nevertheless, passports were necessary for temporary propiska in a number of situations such as checking in a hotel or renting a private dwelling (no marks were placed in the document). Moreover, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Soviet internal passports, accompanied with a special leaflet, were valid for traveling to most Comecon countries and Yugoslavia as a member of a touristic group. The leaflet functioned as an equivalent of exit visa stamped in international passports; destination countries did not require entry visas at that time. =The Russian Federation= In 1992, passports, or other photo identification documents, became necessary to board a train. Train tickets started to bear passenger names, allegedly as an effort to combat speculative reselling of the tickets. The dissolution of the Soviet Union invoked the need to distinguish Russian citizens among the citizens of the former Soviet Union. On 9 December 1992, special leaves were introduced which were affixed in Soviet passports, certifying that the bearer of the passport was a citizen of Russia. These leaves were optional unless travelling to the other former Soviet republics which continued to accept Soviet passports; for other occasions, other proofs of citizenship were accepted as well. Issuance of the leaves continued until the end of 2002. On 8 July 1997, the current design of the Russian internal passport was introduced. Unlike the Soviet passports, which had three photo pages, the new passports have one. A passport is first issued at the age of 14 and then replaced upon at the ages of 20 and 45. The text in the passports is in Russian. Passports issued in autonomous entities may, on the bearer's request, contain an additional leaf duplicating all data in one of the official local languages. A passport exchange was begun; the deadline was initially set at end of 2001 but then prolonged several times and finally set at 30 June 2004. The government had first regulated that having failed to exchange one's passport would constitute a punishable violation. However, the Supreme Court ruled to the effect that citizens cannot be obliged to exchange their passports. The Soviet passports ceased to be valid as means of personal identification since mid-2004, but it is still legal (though barely practicable) to have one. The propiska was formally abandoned soon after adoption of the current Constitution in 1993, and replaced with \\"residency registration\\" which, in principle, was simply notification of one's place of residence. Nevertheless, under the new regulations, permanent registration records are stamped in citizens' internal passports just as were propiskas. That has led to the widespread misconception that registration was just a new name for the propiska; many continue to call it a \\"propiska\\". The misconception is partly reinforced by the fact that the existing rules for registration make it an onerous process, dependent on the consent of landlords, which effectively prevents tenants of flats from registering. Unlike with the propiska, it is not an offense not to have registration unless one resides in a particular dwelling for more than 90 days. From a practical point of view, the long deadline makes it difficult to prove avoidance of residency registration and so to prosecute. De facto citizens have no restriction on where they reside (with the exception of closed cities or near borders). Still, many civil rights are dependent on registration, such as the right to vote. In November 2010, the Federal Migration Service announced the possible cancellation of internal passports, which, if it were implemented, would be replaced by plastic ID cards or drivers' licenses., BBC Russian, 18 –Ω–æ—è–±—Ä—è 2010 In 2013, a plastic ID card, Universal electronic card was introduced, and any citizen had the right to reject it and retain an old-style internal passport.

Passports are the primary means of identification for citizens of Belarus both in homeland and abroad. Belarusian citizens must have a passport after they have reached the age of 14; passports can also be issued to younger children for travelling abroad. Passports are valid for 10 years regardless of age. Apart from visa pages, a considerable number of pages in Belarusian passports are designated for \\"internal\\" records, such as place of residence and marriage. Citizens had to obtain special stamp enabling the passport bearer to cross the border of the Union State before 2005 when the Constitutional Court ruled the practice not conforming to the Constitution. Combination of primary identification document with international passport causes significant inconvenience to bearers who cannot certify their identity while their passports are processed for visas in embassies and consulates. A passport can also be easily invalidated by a careless foreign passport control official by placing a stamp in a reserved page. People's Republic of China The People's Republic of China (PRC) maintains a system of residency registration in mainland China known as hukou, by which government permission is needed to formally change one's place of residence. It is enforced with identity cards. This system effectively controlled internal migration before the 1980s, but subsequent market reforms caused it to collapse as a means of migration control. An estimated 150 to 200 million people are part of the \\"blind flow\\" and have unofficially migrated, generally from poor, rural areas to wealthy, urban ones. However, unofficial residents are often denied official services such as education and medical care and are sometimes subject to both social and political discrimination. Sweden Internal passports were abolished in Sweden in 1860. United States of America  Throughout the Thirteen Colonies before the Revolutionary War, slaves confined to homes or agricultural plantations, or whose movements were limited by curfews, could be required to furnish written evidence their owner had granted an exemption to permit their free movement. For example the New Hampshire Assembly in 1714 passed \\"An Act To Prevent Disorders In The Night\\": Notices emphasizing the curfew were published in The New Hampshire Gazette in 1764 and 1771. Internal passports were required for African Americans in the southern slave states before the American Civil War, for example, an authenticated internal passport dated 1815 was presented to Massachusetts citizen George Barker to allow him to freely travel as a free black man to visit relatives in slave states. After many of these states seceded, forming the Confederate States of America, the central Confederate government not only systematized this system but required internal passports for whites as well. Such an internalized passport in the U.S. today would be unconstitutional under the Privileges and Immunities Clause.

Historically a bank supportive of SMEs it now also possesses particular know-how in the areas of agricultural banking, consumer and mortgage credit, green banking, capital markets, investment banking, leasing and electronic banking. Piraeus Bank Group Piraeus Bank and its subsidiaries form the Piraeus Bank Group. History The historic building in Athens Building in Odessa, Ukraine  Foundation A group of shipowners in Piraeus founded Banque du Pir√©e (Piraeus Bank; BP) in 1916 to finance trade. The bank started trading on the Athens Exchange in 1918.TPEIR: profile.helex.gr The Greek government bought the bank in 1975 and transformed it into a universal bank. The new headquarters designed by Sir Basil Spence were built on Stadiou Street in Athens. In December 1991 the government privatised the bank, which has grown in size and scope since then. Expansion and consolidation In 1995 the Group established Piraeus Bank Romania with 160 branches and one year later Tirana Bank, the first privately owned banking institution in Albania with 56 branches. In 1999 with its acquisition of Xiosbank, PB took over Xios's branch in Sofia, Bulgaria; it has now some 83 branches in the country. PB also acquired the small New York-based Marathon National Bank and Interbank N.Y; it merged Interbank into Marathon Bank. In 1998 the bank absorbed the Greek branch networks of Chase Manhattan Bank, Cr√©dit Lyonnais, and acquired a controlling interest in Macedonia-Thrace Bank. A year later it added in the activities of National Westminster Bank and acquired Xiosbank (Bank of Chios) which it totally absorbed along with Macedonia-Thrace Bank. In 2002 Piraeus Bank signed a strategic alliance with ING Group (bancassurance). In 2005 it acquired the Bulgarian Eurobank, Atlas Bank in Serbia, Egyptian Commercial Bank in Egypt. In 2007 it expanded in Ukraine by acquiring the International Commerce Bank (renamed as Piraeus Bank ICB) and established Piraeus Bank Cyprus with the acquisition of Arab Bank Cyprus. In 2002 the bank absorbed 58% of ETBA Bank (Hellenic Industrial Development Bank). PB also started a strategic alliance with ING Group, which took a 5% stake in the Piraeus Bank. In 2006 the PB sold back to ING its stake in a jointly owned mutual funds company. Cooperation continues via the bank- assurance company ING-PIRAEUS. In 2005 Piraeus Bank acquired the Belgrade- based Atlas banka in Serbia (today Piraeus Bank Beograd with 42 branches), and the Egyptian Commercial Bank (today Piraeus Bank Egypt with 43). In 2007 PB purchased the Cyprus arm of Arab Bank and renamed it Piraeus Bank (Cyprus). On 13 September 2007 Piraeus Bank completed its acquisition of 99.6% of the share capital of International Commercial Bank in Ukraine, today named Piraeus ICB.  Financial crisis  Within the European debt crisis, Piraeus Bank has been subject to the Greek austerity packages: the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund became its main stock holder since 2012 and remained such as of 2020. In 2011, according to reports in July 2012, the bank obscured its real access to capital by providing circular loans to finance purchase of its own stock through undeclared offshore companies. In 2012, Piraeus Bank took part in the restructuring of the Greek banks, gaining a leading position in the Greek banking sector. *In June 2012 Piraeus Bank sold its shares in Marathon Banking Corporation (New York City) to Investors Bancorp. The capital was used to finance the take over of the Greek banks Geniki Bank and healthy parts of ATEbank. *In 2012 it acquired the so-called 'good' part of Agricultural Bank. *In December 2012 it acquired Societe Generale's Geniki Bank. In 2013, Piraeus Bank was considered as having sufficient capital and was included in the group of 4 systemic banks which would be coordinated by the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund to absorb undercapitalised banks. It would reach an international presence consisting of 370 branches focusing in Southeastern Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean as of 2014. *In March 2013 it took over the Greek branches of Bank of Cyprus, Hellenic Bank and CPB Bank. *In June 2013 it took over Millennium Bank (Greece). *In April 2015 it also absorbed the 'good' parts of small Greek Cooperative bank Panellinia. *In May 2015 it sold its subsidiary in Egypt to Al Ahli Bank of Kuwait.

Clare by Risteard Ua Croinin and Martin Breen, The Other Clare, Volume 9, page 17. Shannon Archaeological and Historical Society, April 1985. The tower is adjacent to Dysert O'Dea Monastery. History The Battle of Dysert O'Dea, which drove the Anglo-Normans from the region for over 200 years, took place at this site on 10 May 1318. The castle was built between 1470 and 1490 by Diarmaid O'Dea, Lord of Cineal Fearmaic. The Earl of Ormond took the castle from the O'Dea clan in 1570 by force. By 1584, however, they had regained it. At that time, Domhnall Maol O'Dea was listed as owner. Domhnall supported the northern Chiefs in the Nine Years' War of 1594-1603 and subsequently Dysert Castle fell to the Protestant Bishop of Kildare, Daniel Neylon, who in 1594 bequeathed it to his son, John. The castle soon returned to the O'Dea clan. Conor Cron O'Dea supported the Confederates and participated in the successful siege of Ballyalla Castle in 1642. After the fall of Limerick in 1651 to the Cromwellian forces, they maintained a small garrison here. When they left, the soldiers demolished the battlements, upper floors and staircase. The Neylon family then returned but during the reign of Charles II, Conor Cron O'Dea regained the castle. Conor's sons, Michael and James, supported the cause of James II and once again lost the castle. The lands passed to the Synge family but the castle eventually and gradually fell into ruin. In 1970, John O'Day of Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin (USA) purchased the tower and had it restored. The castle was then leased to the Dysert Development Association, which, with support from the Irish Tourist Board, opened it as \\"The Dysert O'Dea Castle Archaeology Centre\\" in 1986. It showed an exhibition of local artefacts from the stone age to 1922. The tower also won the \\"Clare Tourism Award\\" for being one of the most authentically rebuilt castles in Ireland. Today Today, the centre is known as the Clare Archaeology Centre, with exhibits of local archaeological artefacts from 1000 BC to 1700 AD, local history over the last three centuries, and a wall walk of parts of the castle. The Dysert O'Dea Archeology Trail includes sites around the tower, including the remains of the Dysert O'Dea Monastery. Pictures File:Odea castle.jpgO'Dea Castle near Corofin, Co.

It lies on the west bank of the Saigon River, having B√¨nh T√¢y Market as its central market. Ch·ª£ L·ªõn consists of the western half of District 5 as well as several adjoining neighborhoods in District 6 and District 11. The quarter has long been inhabited by Chinese people, and is considered the largest Chinatown in the world by area. The Vietnamese name Ch·ª£ L·ªõn literally means \\"big\\" (l·ªõn) \\"market\\" (ch·ª£). The Chinese name (and original name) is Â†§Â≤∏ (pronounced Tai-Ngon in Cantonese and Dƒ´'√†n in Mandarin, which means \\"embankment\\" (French: quais). The Vietnamese reading of the Chinese name is ƒê√™ Ng·∫°n, but this is rarely used. Vietnamese speakers exclusively use the name Ch·ª£ L·ªõn, while Chinese speakers (both inside Vietnam and in China) are the only users of the original Chinese name. History Typical shophouse architecture of Cho Lon. The city of Ch·ª£ L·ªõn was established by the Hoa community. The L√™ dynasty which was the ruling family in the sixteenth century began to decline in power and two rival families, the Trinh and Nguyen families began to vie for power to fill in the void of the L√™. Nguyen was then appointed as Viceroy of the South with headquarters at Hu·∫ø where they encouraged Chinese immigration to settle down into the area. In 1778, H√≤a living in Bi√™n H√≤a had to take refuge in what is now Ch·ª£ L·ªõn because they were retaliated against by the T√¢y S∆°n forces for their support of the Nguy·ªÖn lords. In 1782, more than 10,000 H√≤a were again massacred by the T√¢y S∆°n and had to rebuild. They built high embankments against the flows of the river, and called their new settlement Tai-Ngon (meaning \\"embankment\\" in Cantonese). Ch·ª£ L·ªõn was incorporated as a city in 1879, 11 km from Saigon. By the 1930s, it had expanded to the city limit of Saigon. On 27 April 1931, Ch·ª£ L·ªõn and the neighbouring city Sa√Øgon were merged to form a single city called ‚ÄòSaigon‚ÄìCholon‚Äô. The official name, however, never entered everyday vernacular and the city continued to be referred to as ‚ÄòSaigon‚Äô. ‚ÄòCh·ª£ L·ªõn‚Äô was dropped from the city's official name in 1956, after Vietnam gained independence from France in 1955.P. 61, Historic Dictionary of Ho Chi Minh City (written by Justin Corfield; published by Anthem Press in 2013) During the Vietnam War, soldiers and deserters from the United States Army maintained a thriving black market at Ch·ª£ L·ªõn, trading in various American and especially U.S Army-issue items. This was the area, near the Quan √Çm Pagoda where photojournalist Eddie Adams took his famous execution photograph. Four Australian journalists were also killed in Ch·ª£ L·ªõn during the Tet Offensive in 1968. Today, Ch·ª£ L·ªõn attracts many tourists, especially mainland Chinese and Taiwanese.

There are three species: the brush-tailed phascogale (Phascogale tapoatafa), the red-tailed phascogale (P. calura), and the northern brush- tailed phascogale (P. pirata). As with a number of dasyurid species, the males live for only one year, dying after a period of frenzied mating. The term Phascogale was coined in 1824 by Coenraad Jacob Temminck in reference to the brush-tailed phascogale, and means \\"pouched weasel\\". All three species are listed as either Near Threatened or Vulnerable by the IUCN. Phylogeny The following is a phylogenetic tree based on mitochondrial genome sequences: Species Captive P. calura The genus consists of the following three species: * Brush-tailed phascogale ‚Äì Phascogale tapoatafa * Red-tailed phascogale ‚Äì Phascogale calura * Northern brush-tailed phascogale ‚Äì Phascogale pirata Life cycle Mating generally happens between May and July. All males die soon after mating. Females give birth to about 6 young ones about 30 days after mating. Phascogales do not have the true pouch that is found in most other marsupials . Instead, they form temporary folds of skin - sometimes called a \\"pseudo-pouch\\" around the mammary glands during pregnancy. Young stay in this pseudo-pouch area, nursing for about 7 weeks before being moved to a nest where they stay until they are weaned at about 20 weeks of age. Females live for about 3 years, and generally produce one litter. References * External links * Brush-tailed Phascogale fact sheet: . Also: * Red-tailed Phascogale fact sheet: .

Both had their headquarters in Athens, Greece. The first Bank of Athens was founded in 1893 and operated in the Balkans and Eastern Mediterranean until its acquisition by the National Bank of Greece in 1953. In 1993, the second Bank of Athens was founded, and merged with Eurobank Ergasias in 1999. Subsidiaries of the Bank of Athens have been incorporated into foreign financial entities. Some banks in the US have incorporated the phrase, \\"Bank of Athens\\" in their name. First Bank of Athens (1894 1962) Banking hall of the Bank of Athens, Salonika In 1893, E. Empeirikos, A. Lambrinoudis, A. Kallergis, M. Lordanopoulos, and N. Triantafyllidis founded the Bank of Athens using Greek, French, and English capital. The bank opened for business in 1894.Harlaftis G. A History of Greek-owned Shipping: the Making of an International Tramp Fleet, 1830 to the Present Day Routledge 1996, p.133. In 1895, the bank established branches in London, Constantinople, Smyrna, and Khartoum. In 1896, Jean (John) Pesmatzoglou, an Alexandrian private banker, merged his bank with the Bank of Athens and became chairman of the Bank of Athens. In 1904, Pesmatzoglou aligned the Bank of Athens with the Banque de l'Union Parisienne.Cottrell P.

Pesmatzoglou's bank became the Bank of Athens branch in Alexandria, Egypt, where there was a large Greek community. In 1902, a branch was opened in Manchester. In 1906, the Bank of Athens purchased the Industrial Credit Bank (Œ§œÅŒ¨œÄŒµŒ∂Œ± ŒïœÄŒ±Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒºŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ Œ†ŒØœÉœÑŒµœâœÇ) an entity which had operated in Athens since 1873.

In 1921, the Bank of Athens opened an office in New York City. By 1922, the bank had branches throughout Greece, in Limassol and Nicosia, Alexandria, Cairo, Port Said, Galata, Stamboul, Beyoƒülu, Edirne, London and Manchester.International Banking Directory, 1922. In 1923, following the Greco-Turkish War, the Government of Turkey seized the Bank's office in Constantinople. In 1926, the bank's New York City office was made a subsidiary called the \\"Bank of Athens Trust Company\\". In 1930, the National Bank of Greece and the Bank of Athens combined their activities in Egypt to form a subsidiary called the \\"Banque Nationale de Gr√®ce et d‚ÄôAth√©nes\\". By the 1930s, the Bank of Athens also had offices in Kor√ß√´ and Durr√´s. In 1941, during the Axis Occupation of Greece, the Dresdner Bank assumed oversight of the bank. In 1947, the bank founded the South African Bank of Athens to serve Hellenes residing in South Africa.South African Bank of Athens Bank of Athens website. It is a 99.79% subsidiary of National Bank of Greece. In 1953, the Bank of Athens merged with National Bank of Greece to form the \\"National Bank of Greece and Athens\\". In New York City, the two banks merged their subsidiaries into the \\"Atlantic Bank of New York\\". Second Bank of Athens (1992 1999) In 1992, the National Bank of Greece owned seventy-five percent of the Credit Bank of Professionals (Œ§œÅŒ¨œÄŒµŒ∂Œ± ŒïœÄŒ±Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒºŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ Œ†ŒØœÉœÑŒµœâœÇ), when it sold sixty- seven percent of its holdings to the Hanwha Bank.

In 1999, Eurobank Ergasias absorbed the Bank of Athens. Bank of Athens in foreign nations The name, \\"Bank of Athens\\" has been used in the branding of several banks in the US. The First National Bank of Athens arrived in Europe from the USA. It was merged with a small British private bank to form the \\"Gunners Bishop Bank of Athens\\". This bank operated as a British bank in the City of London (Fenchurch Street, London EC3). The Bank was Greece's representative bank in London from 1860 until 27 February 1953 when it became part of Barclays Bank PLC of London. A 1906 Act of Parliament had regulated the industrial and state banks in Britain giving Greece's representative banks an official status. When the World Trade Centre opened in London, the Bank of Athens was invited. Also in 1906, the Bank of Athens was absorbed by the International Credit Industry Banque de Grece, in France, becoming the bank's presence in Europe. This bank also did British Government business from 1908 as the \\"London Bankers\\". The bank opened a branch in Constantinople-Karakkoy in 1906, when the Banque D'Athenes worked with French Treasury, Basel II with Bourse de Paris and Constantinople. In 1930, the \\"Banque Nationale de Grece and d'√Åthenes, France\\" was created via mergers and in 1932, it moved to London. In 1956 the First National Bank of Athens arrived in the US.

Descents are part of normal procedures, but also occur during emergencies, such as rapid or explosive decompression, forcing an emergency descent to below and preferably below , respectively the maximum temporary safe altitude for an unpressurized aircraft and the maximum safe altitude for extended duration. The table lists Above 10,000 [ft] to be limited to six minutes.See Loss of pressurization: The maximum sustained cabin pressure altitude is . To counter potential passenger and crew decompression sickness, hypoxia, edemas, and rewarm the cabin, pilots descend to minimum safe altitude which avoids terrain. An example of explosive decompression is Aloha Airlines Flight 243. Involuntary descent might occur from a decrease in power, decreased lift (wing icing), an increase in drag, or flying in an air mass moving downward, such as a terrain induced downdraft, near a thunderstorm, in a downburst, or microburst. Normal descents Intentional descents might be undertaken to land, avoid other air traffic or poor flight conditions (turbulence, icing conditions, or bad weather), clouds (particularly under visual flight rules), to see something lower, to enter warmer air (see adiabatic lapse rate), or to take advantage of wind direction of a different altitude, particularly with balloons. Normal descents take place at a constant airspeed and constant angle of descent (3 degree final approach at most airports). The pilot controls the angle of descent by varying engine power and pitch angle (lowering the nose) to keep the airspeed constant. Unpowered descents (such as engine failure) are steeper than powered descents but flown in a similar way as a glider. Rapid descents Rapid descents relate to dramatic changes in cabin air pressure‚Äîeven pressurized aircraft‚Äîand can result in discomfort in the middle ear. Relief is achieved by decreasing relative pressure by equalizing the middle ear with ambient pressure (\\"popping ears\\") through swallowing, yawning, chewing, or the valsalva maneuver. Helicopters which lose power do not simply fall out of the sky. In a maneuver called autorotation, the pilot configures the rotors to spin faster driven by the upward moving air, which limits the rate of descent. Very shortly before meeting the ground, the pilot changes the momentum stored in the rotor to increase lift to slow the rate of descent to a normal landing (but without extended hovering). Dives Ju 87B \\"Stuka\\" dive bomber A dive or nosedive is \\"a steep descending flight path\\".Crane, Dale: Dictionary of Aeronautical Terms, third edition, page 168. Aviation Supplies & Academics, 1997. While there is no specific definition for what degree of steepness transforms a downward trajectory into a dive, it is necessarily a rapid, nose- forward descent. Dives are used intentionally in aerobatic flying to build speed for the performance of stunts, and by dive bombers to approach a target quickly while minimizing exposure to enemy fire before the dive. A dive may also be used as an emergency maneuver, for example to extinguish an engine fire. Pilots of the World War II dive bomber known as the Stuka particularly noted the effects of the dive. Beginning at a height of , the Stuka would roll 180¬∞, automatically nosing into a dive. The aircraft would then dive at a 60-90¬∞ angle, holding a constant speed of , until it had gone some 90% of the way to the ground, releasing its bombs at a minimum height of .Griehl, Manfred. Junker Ju 87 Stuka. London/Stuttgart: Airlife Publishing/Motorbuch, 2001. . Once the pilot released the bomb and initiated an automatic pull-out mechanism by depressing a knob on the control column, the aircraft automatically began a six g pullout. The tremendous g-forces to which pilots were subjected during this maneuver could lead to momentary blackouts, necessitating the inclusion of mechanisms to automate pullout from the dive while the pilot was unconscious.

She was a largely behind-the- scenes organizer whose career spanned more than five decades. In New York City and the South, she worked alongside some of the most noted civil rights leaders of the 20th century, including W. E. B. Du Bois, Thurgood Marshall, A. Philip Randolph, and Martin Luther King Jr. She also mentored many emerging activists, such as Diane Nash, Stokely Carmichael, Rosa Parks, and Bob Moses, whom she first mentored as leaders in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Baker criticized professionalized, charismatic leadership; she promoted grassroots organizing, radical democracy, and the ability of the oppressed to understand their worlds and advocate for themselves. She realized this vision most fully in the 1960s as the primary advisor and strategist of the SNCC. Baker has been called \\"one of the most important American leaders of the twentieth century and perhaps the most influential woman in the civil rights movement.\\" She is known for her critiques not only of racism within American culture, but also of sexism within the civil rights movement.Ransby (2003), Ella Baker & the Black Freedom Movement, p. 189 Early life and education Ella Josephine Baker was born on December 13, 1903, in Norfolk, Virginia, to Georgiana (called Anna) and Blake Baker, and first raised there. She was the second of three surviving children, bracketed by her older brother Blake Curtis and younger sister Maggie.Ransby (2003), p. 14. Her father worked on a steamship line that sailed out of Norfolk, and so was often away. Her mother took in boarders to earn extra money. In 1910, Norfolk had a race riot in which whites attacked black workers from the shipyard. Her mother decided to take the family back to North Carolina while their father continued to work for the steamship company. Ella was seven when they returned to her mother's rural hometown near Littleton, North Carolina.Ransby (2003), pp. 29‚Äì31. As a child, Baker grew up with little influence. Her grandfather Mitchell had died, and her father's parents lived a day's ride away. She often listened to her grandmother, Josephine Elizabeth \\"Bet\\" Ross, tell stories about slavery and leaving the South to escape its oppressive society.Ransby (2003), pp. 13‚Äì63. At an early age, Baker gained a sense of social injustice, as she listened to her grandmother's horror stories of life as a slave. Her grandmother was beaten and whipped for refusing to marry another slave her owner chose, and told Ella stories of life as an African-American woman during this period. Giving her granddaughter context to the African-American experience helped Ella understand the injustices black people still faced. Ella attended Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina, and graduated with valedictorian honors. Decades later, she returned to Shaw to help found SNCC.Davis, Marcia. \\"Ella Baker: An Unsung Civil Rights-Era Legend.\\" The Crisis, vol. 110, no. 3, May 2003, pp. 48‚Äì49. New York City Baker worked as editorial assistant at the Negro National News. In 1930, George Schuyler, a black journalist and anarchist (and later an arch-conservative), founded the Young Negroes Cooperative League (YNCL). It sought to develop black economic power through collective networks. They conducted \\"conferences and trainings in the 1930s in their attempt to create a small, interlocking system of cooperative economic societies throughout the US\\" for black economic development. Having befriended Schuyler, Baker joined his group in 1931 and soon became its national director. Baker also worked for the Worker's Education Project of the Works Progress Administration, established under President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. Baker taught courses in consumer education, labor history, and African history. She immersed herself in the cultural and political milieu of Harlem in the 1930s, protesting Italy's invasion of Ethiopia and supporting the campaign to free the Scottsboro defendants in Alabama. She also founded the Negro History Club at the Harlem Library and regularly attended lectures and meetings at the YWCA. During this time, Baker lived with and married her college sweetheart, T. J. (Bob) Roberts. They divorced in 1958. Baker rarely discussed her private life or marital status. According to fellow activist Bernice Johnson Reagon, many women in the Civil Rights Movement followed Baker's example, adopting a practice of dissemblance about their private lives that allowed them to be accepted as individuals in the movement.Ransby (2003), p. 9. Baker befriended John Henrik Clarke, a future scholar and activist; Pauli Murray, a future writer and civil rights lawyer; and others who became lifelong friends.Ransby (2003), pp. 64‚Äì104. The Harlem Renaissance influenced her thoughts and teachings. She advocated widespread, local action as a means of social change. Her emphasis on a grassroots approach to the struggle for equal rights influenced the growth and success of the civil rights movement of the mid-20th century.Ransby, Ella Baker (2003). NAACP (1938‚Äì1953) In 1938 Baker began her long association with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), then based in New York City. In December 1940 she started work there as a secretary. She traveled widely for the organization, especially in the South, recruiting members, raising money, and organizing local chapters. She was named director of branches in 1943,Ransby (2003), p. 137. and became the NAACP's highest-ranking woman. An outspoken woman, Baker believed in egalitarian ideals. She pushed the NAACP to decentralize its leadership structure and to aid its membership in more activist campaigns at the local level. Baker believed that the strength of an organization grew from the bottom up, not the top down. She believed that the branches' work was the NAACP's lifeblood. Baker despised elitism and placed her confidence in many. She believed that the bedrock of any social change organization is not its leaders' eloquence or credentials, but the commitment and hard work of the rank and file membership and their willingness and ability to engage in discussion, debate, and decision-making.Ransby (2003), p. 139. She especially stressed the importance of young people and women in the organization. While traveling throughout the South on the NAACP's behalf, Baker met hundreds of black people, establishing lasting relationships with them. She slept in their homes, ate at their tables, spoke in their churches, and earned their trust. She wrote thank-you notes and expressed her gratitude to the people she met. This personalized approach was one important aspect of Baker's effectiveness in recruiting more NAACP members.Ransby (2003), p. 136. She formed a network of people in the South who would be important in the continued fight for civil rights. Whereas some northern organizers tended to talk down to rural southerners, Baker's ability to treat everyone with respect helped her in recruiting. Baker fought to make the NAACP more democratic. She tried to find a balance between voicing her concerns and maintaining a unified front. Between 1944 and 1946, Baker directed leadership conferences in several major cities, such as Chicago and Atlanta. She got top officials to deliver lectures, offer welcoming remarks, and conduct workshops.Ransby (2003), p. 150. In 1946, Baker took in her niece Jackie, whose mother was unable to care for her. Due to her new responsibilities, Baker left her full-time position with the NAACP and began to serve as a volunteer. She soon joined the NAACP's New York branch to work on local school desegregation and police brutality issues. She became its president in 1952.Ransby (2003), p. 148. In this role, she supervised the field secretaries and coordinated the national office's work with local groups. Baker's top priority was to lessen the organization's bureaucracy and give women more power in the organization; this included reducing Walter Francis White's dominating role as executive secretary. Baker believed the program should be primarily channeled not through White and the national office, but through the people in the field. She lobbied to reduce the rigid hierarchy, place more power in the hands of capable local leaders, and give local branches greater responsibility and autonomy.Ransby (2003), p. 138. In 1953 she resigned from the presidency to run for the New York City Council on the Liberal Party ticket, but was unsuccessful.Ransby (2003), pp. 105‚Äì158. Southern Christian Leadership Conference (1957‚Äì1960) In January 1957, Baker went to Atlanta to attend a conference aimed at developing a new regional organization to build on the success of the Montgomery bus boycott in Alabama. After a second conference in February, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) was formed. This was initially planned as a loosely structured coalition of church-based leaders who were engaged in civil rights struggles across the South.Ransby (2003), p. 174. The group wanted to emphasize the use of nonviolent actions to bring about social progress and racial justice for southern blacks. They intended to rely on the existing black churches, at the heart of their communities, as a base of its support. Its strength would be built on the political activities of local church affiliates. The SCLC leaders envisioned themselves as the political arm of the black church.Ransby (2003), p. 175. The SCLC first appeared publicly as an organization at the 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom. Baker was one of three major organizers of this large-scale event. She demonstrated her ability to straddle organizational lines, ignoring and minimizing rivalries and battles.Ransby (2003), p. 176. The conference's first project was the 1958 Crusade for Citizenship, a voter registration campaign to increase the number of registered African-American voters for the 1958 and 1960 elections. Baker was hired as Associate Director, the first staff person for the SCLC. Reverend John Tilley became the first Executive Director. Baker worked closely with southern civil rights activists in Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, and gained respect for her organizing abilities. She helped initiate voter registration campaigns and identify other local grievances. Their strategy included education, sermons in churches, and efforts to establish grassroots centers to stress the importance of the vote. They also planned to rely on the Civil Rights Act of 1957 to protect local voters. While the project did not achieve its immediate goals, it laid the groundwork for strengthening local activist centers to build a mass movement for the vote across the South. After John Tilley resigned as director of the SCLC, Baker lived and worked in Atlanta for two and a half years as interim executive director until Reverend Wyatt Tee Walker started in the role in April 1960.Ransby (2003), pp. 170‚Äì175. Baker's job with the SCLC was more frustrating than fruitful. She was unsettled politically, physically, and emotionally. She had no solid allies in the office. Historian Thomas F. Jackson notes that Baker criticized the organization for \\"programmatic sluggishness and King's distance from the people. King was a better orator than democratic crusader[, she] concluded.\\" \\"Participatory democracy\\" In the 1960s, the idea of \\"participatory democracy\\" became popular among political activists, including those in the Civil Rights Movement. It combined the traditional appeal of democracy with an innovative tie to broader grass roots participation. The new movement had three primary emphases: * An appeal for grassroots involvement of people throughout society, while making their own decisions * The minimization of (bureaucratic) hierarchy and the associated emphasis on expertise and professionalism as a basis for leadership * A call for direct action as an answer to fear, isolation, and intellectual detachmentWomen in the Civil Rights Movement, pp. 51‚Äì52. Baker said: > You didn't see me on television, you didn't see news stories about me. The > kind of role that I tried to play was to pick up pieces or put together > pieces out of which I hoped organization might come. My theory is, strong > people don't need strong leaders.Women in the Civil Rights Movement, p. 51. According to activist Mumia Abu-Jamal, Baker advocated a more collectivist model of leadership over the \\"prevailing messianic style of the period.\\"Abu- Jamal, Mumia. We Want Freedom: A Life in the Black Panther Party. South End Press: Cambridge, 2004. p. 159. Baker was largely arguing against the civil rights movement being structured along the organization model of the black church. The black church then had largely female membership and male leadership. Baker questioned not only the gendered hierarchy of the civil rights movement but also that of the Black church. Baker, King, and other SCLC members were reported to have differences in opinion and philosophy during the 1950s and 1960s. She was older than many of the young ministers she worked with, which added to their tensions. She once said that the \\"movement made Martin, and not Martin the movement.\\" When she gave a speech urging activists to take control of the movement themselves, rather than rely on a leader with \\"heavy feet of clay,\\" it was widely interpreted as a denunciation of King.Barbra Harris, \\"Ella Baker: Backbone of the Civil Rights Movement\\", Jackson Advocate News Service Baker's philosophy was \\"power to the people.\\" If members worked together, she believed that a group's force could make significant changes. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (1960‚Äì1966) That same year, 1960, on the heels of regional desegregation sit-ins led by black college students, Baker persuaded the SCLC to invite southern university students to the Southwide Youth Leadership Conference at Shaw University on Easter weekend. This was a gathering of sit-in leaders to meet, assess their struggles, and explore the possibilities for future actions.Ransby (2003), p. 240. At this meeting, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC, pronounced \\"snick\\") was formed. Baker saw the potential for a special type of leadership by the young sit-in leaders, who were not yet prominent in the movement. She believed they could revitalize the Black Freedom Movement and take it in a new direction. Baker wanted to bring the sit-in participants together in a way that would sustain the momentum of their actions, teach them the skills necessary, provide the resources that were needed, and also help them to coalesce into a more militant and democratic force.Ransby (2003), p. 239. To this end she worked to keep the students independent of the older, church-based leadership. In her address at Shaw, she warned the activists to be wary of \\"leader-centered orientation.\\" Julian Bond later described the speech as \\"an eye opener\\" and probably the best of the conference. \\"She didn't say, 'Don't let Martin Luther King tell you what to do,'\\" Bond remembers, \\"but you got the real feeling that that's what she meant.\\" SNCC became the most active organization in the deeply oppressed Mississippi Delta. It was relatively open to women.Women in the Civil Rights Movement, p. 2. Following the conference at Shaw, Baker resigned from the SCLC and began a long and close relationship with SNCC.Creating Black Americans, p. 291. Along with Howard Zinn, Baker was one of SNCC's highly revered adult advisors, and she was known as the \\"Godmother of SNCC.\\" In 1961 Baker persuaded the SNCC to form two wings: one wing for direct action and the second wing for voter registration. With Baker's help SNCC, along with the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), coordinated the region-wide Freedom Rides of 1961. They also expanded their grassroots movement among black sharecroppers, tenant farmers, and others throughout the South. Ella Baker insisted that \\"strong people don't need strong leaders,\\" and criticized the notion of a single charismatic leader of movements for social change. In keeping the idea of \\"participatory democracy\\", Baker wanted each person to get involved.Creating Black Americans, p. 292. She also argued that \\"people under the heel,\\" the most oppressed members of any community, \\"had to be the ones to decide what action they were going to take to get (out) from under their oppression\\". She was a teacher and mentor to the young people of SNCC, influencing such important future leaders as Julian Bond, Diane Nash, Stokely Carmichael, Curtis Muhammad, Bob Moses, and Bernice Johnson Reagon. Through SNCC, Baker's ideas of group-centered leadership and the need for radical democratic social change spread throughout the student movements of the 1960s. For instance, the Students for a Democratic Society, the major antiwar group of the day, promoted participatory democracy. These ideas also influenced a wide range of radical and progressive groups that would form in the 1960s and 1970s.Ransby (2003), pp. 239‚Äì272. In 1964 Baker helped organize the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) as an alternative to the all-white Mississippi Democratic Party. She worked as the coordinator of the Washington office of the MFDP and accompanied a delegation of the MFDP to the 1964 National Democratic Party convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The group wanted to challenge the national party to affirm the rights of African Americans to participate in party elections in the South, where they were still largely disenfranchised. When MFDP delegates challenged the pro- segregationist, all-white official delegation, a major conflict ensued. The MFDP delegation was not seated, but their influence on the Democratic Party later helped to elect many black leaders in Mississippi. They forced a rule change to allow women and minorities to sit as delegates at the Democratic National Convention.Ransby (2003), pp. 330‚Äì344. The 1964 schism with the national Democratic Party led SNCC toward the \\"black power\\" position. Baker was less involved with SNCC during this period, but her withdrawal was due more to her declining health than to ideological differences. According to her biographer Barbara Ransby, Baker believed that black power was a relief from the \\"stale and unmoving demands and language of the more mainstream civil rights groups at the time.\\"Ransby (2003), pp. 347‚Äì351. She also accepted the turn towards armed self-defense that SNCC made in the course of its development. Her friend and biographer Joanne Grant wrote that \\"Baker, who always said that she would never be able to turn the other cheek, turned a blind eye to the prevalence of weapons. While she herself would rely on her fists ‚Ä¶ she had no qualms about target practice.\\"Grant, Joanne, Ella Baker: Freedom Bound (Wiley, 1999), pp. 194‚Äì199. Southern Conference Education Fund (1962‚Äì1967) From 1962 to 1967, Baker worked on the staff of the Southern Conference Education Fund (SCEF). Its goal was to help black and white people work together for social justice; the interracial desegregation and human rights group was based in the South. SCEF raised funds for black activists, lobbied for implementation of President John F. Kennedy's civil rights proposals, and tried to educate southern whites about the evils of racism.Ransby (2003), p. 231. Federal civil rights legislation was passed by Congress and signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 and 1965, but implementation took years. In SCEF, Baker worked closely with her friend Anne Braden, a white longtime anti-racist activist. Braden had been accused in the 1950s of being a communist by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Baker believed that socialism was a humane alternative to capitalism, but had mixed feelings about communism. She became a staunch defender of Braden and her husband Carl; she encouraged SNCC to reject red-baiting as divisive and unfair. During the 1960s, Baker participated in a speaking tour and co-hosted several meetings on the importance of linking civil rights and civil liberties.Ransby (2003), pp. 209‚Äì238, 273‚Äì328. Final years In 1967 Baker returned to New York City, where she continued her activism. She later collaborated with Arthur Kinoy and others to form the Mass Party Organizing Committee, a socialist organization. In 1972 she traveled the country in support of the \\"Free Angela\\" campaign, demanding the release of activist and writer Angela Davis, who had been arrested in California as a communist. Davis was acquitted after representing herself in court. Baker also supported the Puerto Rican independence movement and spoke out against apartheid in South Africa. She allied with a number of women's groups, including the Third World Women's Alliance and the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. She remained an activist until her death in 1986 on her 83rd birthday.Ransby (2003), pp. 344‚Äì374. Baker was a very private person. Many people close to her did not know that she was married for 20 years to T. J. \\"Bob\\" Roberts. Baker kept her own surname.Ransby (2003), pp. 101‚Äì103.

Males of this species do not live past the age of one, as they die after reproducing. Taxonomy The brush-tailed phascogale was first described by Friedrich Meyer in 1793; George Shaw published a revised description in 1800. For some time it was considered a member of the opossum genus Didelphis, but this ended in 1844 when Coenraad Jacob Temminck erected the genus Phascogale. The species is closely related to the red-tailed phascogale (P. calura). Its scientific name, tapoatafa, is a reference to an indigenous Australian name for the species. It has sometimes been known as Phascogale penicillata, referring to its brushed tail. In 2015 three subspecies were identified, and the previous subspecies P. t. pirata was confirmed as a separate species P. pirata: *P. t. tapoatafa, found in southeast Australia from South Australia to mid-coastal Queensland; *P. t. wambenger, found in southwest Western Australia; *P. t. kimberleyensis, found in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. The subspecies that the population in Cape York Peninsula represents has yet to be identified. Description lithograph by Henry Constantine Richter, from The Mammals of Australia by John Gould This phascogale is black. Its tail is covered with long black hairs on the lower half that can erect, causing it to appear similar to a bottle brush. Body length is between with a 16 to 24 cm tail. Males, which can reach up to , are larger than females, normally weighing less than 210 g. arkive.org Distribution and habitat The brush- tailed phascogale has a widespread but fragmented distribution throughout all states of Australia, excluding Tasmania. As a result of habitat destruction and predation by the red fox and feral cat, they are believed to have disappeared from roughly half of their former range. The species is considered very vulnerable to localised extinction. It is listed as a vulnerable species on Schedule 2 of the Threatened Species Conservation Act, 1995 (TSC Act, NSW). However the IUCN Red List lists it only as near threatened, and it does not have an EPBC Act status. Diet This species is a nocturnal and arboreal hunter. It eats smaller mammals, birds, lizards, and insects, particularly spiders. It also drinks nectar from flowering trees. The species has been reported to attack domestic poultry. The Brush-tailed phascogale is a host of the Acanthocephalan intestinal parasite Australiformis semoni. Reproduction Breeding occurs between June and August when the females come into estrus. All male brush-tailed phascogales die before reaching one year of age, generally from stress-related diseases brought about by the energy expended in a bout of frenzied mating. However, some captive males have lived to the age of three, though they were reproductively unviable after the first year. Females nest in hollow trees, bearing litters of 7 to 8 young which stay in the nest to the age of 5 months.

Six Feet Over: Adventures in the Afterlife. Canongate books. pp. 122‚Äì130. Early life Victoria Helen MacFarlane was born in Callander, Perthshire on 25 November 1897, the daughter of Archibald McFarlane, a slater, and Isabella Rattray. At school, she alarmed her fellow pupils with her dire prophecies and hysterical behaviour, to the distress of her mother (a member of the Presbyterian church). After leaving school, she worked at Dundee Royal Infirmary, and in 1916 she married Henry Duncan, a cabinet maker and wounded war veteran, who was supportive of her supposed paranormal talents. A mother of six, she also worked part-time in a bleach factory. Practising medium Photograph shot by Harvey Metcalfe during a 1928 s√©ance, revealing Duncan with dolls. In 1926 she developed from clairvoyant to physical medium by offering s√©ances in which she claimed to be able to permit the spirits of recently deceased persons to materialise, by emitting ectoplasm from her mouth. In 1928 the photographer Harvey Metcalfe attended a series of s√©ances at the house of Duncan. During a s√©ance he took various flash photographs of Duncan and her alleged \\"materialization\\" spirits including her spirit guide \\"Peggy\\".Malcolm Gaskill. (2001). Hellish Nell: Last of Britain's Witches. Fourth Estate. p. 100. The photographs that were taken reveal the spirits to be fraudulently produced, such as a doll made from a painted papier-m√¢ch√© mask draped in an old sheet.Jason Karl. (2007). An Illustrated History of the Haunted World. New Holland Publishers. p. 79. In 1931, the London Spiritualist Alliance (LSA) examined Duncan's method. It was observed that upon opening her mouth, the ectoplasm gradually began to be formed on the tip of the tongue until it resembled a cherry. It then swelled up, sometimes to the extent of covering the medium‚Äôs body. When the ectoplasm retreated into the mouth, it diminished at the tip of the tongue into the likeness of a cherry, as it first appeared. None of the substance appeared at any time in the pharynx, disproving the idea that the ectoplasm was regurgitated cheesecloth, which is a cotton cloth.Paul Gaunt. (2017). \\"An Important Consideration in the Early Helen Duncan Test Seances\\". The Pioneer, vol. 4, no. 3 The latter hypothesis was put forward by the psychical researcher Harry Price, who examined her at the National Laboratory of Psychical Research (NLPR). Because of this accusation, she was persuaded by Harry Price to swallow a tablet of methylene blue before one of her s√©ances to rule out any chance of this trick being performed. Contrary results of this experiment have been recorded. One account stated that no ectoplasm appeared.Ren√©e Haynes. (1982). The Society for Psychical Research 1882‚Äì1982: A History. MacDonald & Co. p. 144. \\"The London Spiritualist Alliance had fifty sittings with her between October 1930 and June 1931; for these sittings she was stripped, searched and dressed in 'seance garments'. Two interim reports in Light were favorable, a third found indications of fraud. Pieces of 'ectoplasm' found from time to time differed in composition. Two early specimens consisted of paper or cloth mixed with something like white of egg. Two others were pads of surgical gauze soaked in 'a resinous fluid'; yet another consisted of layers of lavatory paper stuck together. The most usual material for 'ectoplasm' however, seemed to be butter muslin or cheesecloth, probably swallowed and regurgitated. Distressing choking noises were sometimes heard from within the cabinet; and it was interesting that when she was persuaded to swallow a tablet of methylene blue before one of the seances at the London Spiritualist Alliance, no ectoplasm whatsoever appeared.\\" The investigation report concluded that the \\"material was swallowed by Mrs Duncan at some time previous to the sitting and subsequently regurgitated by her for the purpose of exhibition.\\"Simeon Edmunds. (1966). Spiritualism: A Critical Survey. Aquarian Press. pp. 137‚Äì144 The other account stated that she still produced clean, white ectoplasm.Mary Armour. (2000). Helen Duncan, my Living has not been in Vain. Pembridge Publishing. A piece of ectoplasm from one of Duncan's early s√©ances was obtained and secured in a bottle of distilled water. It was given to Harry Price, who was originally enthusiastic about the sample. However, when he gave the sample to a chemist for analysis it was discovered to be made from egg white mixed with chemicals. Price later duplicated Duncan's ectoplasm with similar substances.Paul Tabori. (1961). The Art of Folly. Prentice-Hall International, Inc. pp. 180‚Äì182. Duncan with fake ectoplasm made of cheesecloth and a cut out face from a magazine. In 1931 Price paid Duncan ¬£50 to perform a number of test s√©ances. She was suspected of swallowing cheesecloth which was then regurgitated as \\"ectoplasm\\".Harry Price. (1942). Search for Truth: My Life for Psychical Research. Collins. p. 182 Price had proven through analysis of a sample of ectoplasm produced by Duncan that it was made of cheesecloth.Marina Warner. (2008). Phantasmagoria: Spirit Visions, Metaphors, and Media into the Twenty- first Century. Oxford University Press. p. 299. She reacted violently at attempts to X-ray her, running from the laboratory and making a scene in the street, where her husband had to restrain her, destroying the controlled nature of the test. According to Price in a report of the mediumship of Duncan: Price in his report published photographs of Duncan in his laboratory that revealed fake ectoplasm made from cheesecloth, rubber gloves and cut-out heads from magazine covers which she pretended to her audiences were spirits.Harry Price. (1933). Leaves from a Psychist's Case-Book. Victor Gollancz Ltd. pp. 203‚Äì207 Psychologist William McDougall, who attended two of the s√©ances, pronounced her \\"whole performance fraudulent\\" in an appendix to the report.Valentine, Elizabeth R. (2011). Spooks and Spoofs: Relations Between Psychical Research and Academic Psychology in Britain in the Inter-War Period. History of the Human Sciences 25: 67-90. Following the report written by Price, Duncan's former maid Mary McGinlay confessed in detail to having aided Duncan in her mediumship tricks, and Duncan's husband admitted that the ectoplasm materializations were the result of regurgitation.Paul Tabori. (1961). The Art of Folly. Prentice-Hall International, Inc. p. 182 \\"In November 1931, Harry Price's report was issued, whereupon a Miss Mary McGinlay, came forward. She was Mrs Duncan's personal maid at the time of the s√©ances and she made a statutory declaration before a Commissioner of Oaths that she used to purchase for Mrs. Duncan lengths of cheesecloth which she had to wash out after a s√©ance. She also swore on oath that Mr. Duncan had informed her on the night of the scene at the National Laboratory that his wife had \\"passed a roll of butter muslin to him when they were alone in the street.\\" In a s√©ance on 6 January 1933 in Edinburgh, a little girl called Peggy emerged in the s√©ance room. A sitter named Esson Maule grabbed her and the lights were turned on and the spirit was revealed to be made from a stockinette undervest. The police were called and Duncan was prosecuted and fined ¬£10.Raymond Buckland. (2005). The Spirit Book: The Encyclopedia of Clairvoyance, Channeling, and Spirit Communication Visible Ink Press. p. 117. The undervest was used as evidence which led to Duncan's conviction of fraudulent mediumship at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court trial on 11 May 1933.Harry Price. (1933). Leaves from a Psychist's Case-book. Gollancz. p. 176 The spiritualist journal Light endorsed the court decision that Duncan was fraudulent and supported Price's investigation that revealed her ectoplasm was cheesecloth.Hazelgrove, Jenny. (2000). Spiritualism and British Society Between the Wars. Manchester University Press. p. 279. Duncan's husband was also suspected of acting as her accomplice by hiding her fake ectoplasm. Duncan frequently had nosebleeds during s√©ances; William Brown suggested that this was another of Duncan's hiding places for her fake ectoplasm.Malcolm Gaskill. (2001). Hellish Nell: Last of Britain's Witches. Fourth Estate. p. 237. In 1936 psychical researcher Nandor Fodor offered money to Duncan if she would be filmed with an infrared camera during a s√©ance; she refused.Ruth Paley, Simon Fowler. (2005). Family Skeletons: Exploring the Lives of our Disreputable Ancestors. The National Archives. p. 220. HMS Barham sinking During World War II, in November 1941, Duncan held a s√©ance in Portsmouth at which she claimed the spirit materialization of a sailor told her HMS Barham had been sunk. Because the sinking of HMS Barham was revealed, in strict confidence, only to the relatives of casualties, and not announced to the public until late January 1942, the Navy started to take an interest in her activities. Two lieutenants were among her audience at a s√©ance on 14 January 1944. One of these was a Lieutenant Worth who was not impressed as a white cloth figure had appeared behind the curtains claiming to be his aunt but he had no deceased aunt. In the same sitting another figure appeared claiming to be his sister but Worth replied his sister was alive and well. Worth was disgusted by the s√©ance and reported it to the police. This was followed up on 19 January, when undercover policemen arrested her at another s√©ance as a white-shrouded manifestation appeared. This proved to be Duncan herself, in a white cloth which she attempted to conceal when discovered, and she was arrested. Researcher Graeme Donald wrote that Duncan could have easily found out about HMS Barham and she had no genuine psychic powers. According to Donald: A leak concerning HMS Barham was later discovered. A secretary of the First Lord had been indiscreet to Professor Michael Postan of the Ministry of Economic Warfare. Postan said that he believed he had been told officially, and was not arrested.Nigel West. (2010). Historical Dictionary of Naval Intelligence. Scarecrow Press. p. 98. Duncan was found to be in possession of a mocked-up HMS Barham hat-band. This apparently related to an alleged manifestation of the spirit of a dead sailor on HMS Barham, although Duncan apparently did not know that after 1939 sailors' hat bands carried only 'H.M.S.' and did not identify their ship. She was initially arrested under section 4 of the Vagrancy Act 1824, a minor offence tried by magistrates. The authorities regarded the case as more serious, and eventually discovered section 4 of the Witchcraft Act 1735, covering fraudulent \\"spiritual\\" activity, which was triable before a jury. Charged alongside her for conspiracy to contravene this Act were Ernest and Elizabeth Homer, who operated the Psychic centre in Portsmouth, and Frances Brown, who was Duncan's agent and went with her to set up s√©ances. There were seven counts, two of conspiracy to contravene the Witchcraft Act, two of obtaining money by false pretences, and three of the common law offence of public mischief. The prosecution may be explained by the mood of suspicion prevailing at the time: the authorities were afraid that she could continue to reveal classified information, whatever her source was.Spell broken for 20th century witch. BBC, 31 January 1998 There were also concerns that she was exploiting the recently bereaved, as the Recorder noted when passing sentence. Duncan's trial for fraudulent witchcraft was a minor cause c√©l√®bre in wartime London. Alfred Dodd, a historian and senior Freemason, testified he was convinced she was authentic. The trial was complicated by the fact that a police raid on the s√©ance in Portsmouth, leading to the arrest of Helen Duncan, yielded no physical evidence of the fraudulent use of cheesecloth, and was therefore based entirely on witness testimony, the majority of which denied any wrongdoing.Helena Normanton. (1945). The Trial of Mrs. Duncan. Edited with a Foreword by C. E. Bechhofer Roberts. Jarrolds Publishers. Duncan was barred by the judge from demonstrating her alleged powers as part of her defence against being fraudulent. The jury brought in a guilty verdict on count one, and the judge then discharged them from giving verdicts on the other counts, as he held that they were alternative offences for which Duncan might have been convicted had the jury acquitted her on the first count. Duncan was imprisoned for nine months, Brown for four months and the Homers were bound over. After the verdict, Winston Churchill wrote a memo to Home Secretary Herbert Morrison, complaining about the misuse of court resources on the \\"obsolete tomfoolery\\" of the charge. Repeal of the Witchcraft Act In 1944, Duncan was one of the last people convicted under the Witchcraft Act 1735, which made falsely claiming to procure spirits a crime. She was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment. When convicted, she cried out \\"I have done nothing; is there a God?\\". On her release in 1945, Duncan promised to stop conducting s√©ances, but she was arrested during another one in 1956. She died at her home in Edinburgh a short time later. Duncan's trial almost certainly contributed to the repeal of the Witchcraft Act, which was contained in the Fraudulent Mediums Act 1951 promoted by Walter Monslow, Labour Member of Parliament for Barrow-in-Furness. The campaign to repeal the Act had largely been led by Thomas Brooks, another Labour MP, who was a spiritualist. Duncan's original conviction still stood, and it was the subject of a sustained campaign to have it overturned. Death Contrary to what some spiritualists have written there was nothing strange or unusual about the death of Duncan and it was not caused by her \\"trance\\" being disturbed by the police. Duncan's medical records showed that she had a long history of ill-health and as early as 1944 she was described as an obese woman who could only move slowly as she suffered from heart trouble. Legacy After her death, Duncan was cited in paranormal and parapsychological books as an example of a fraudulent medium.Paul Tabori, (1961). Simeon Edmunds. (1966). Georgess McHargue, (1972). Ren√©e Haynes, (1982). Paul Kurtz, (1985). Mary Roach, (2007). However, she retained supporters amongst the spiritualist community.Maurice Barbanell, (1945). Alan Crossley, (1976). Manfred Cassirer, (1996). Hartley, (2007). On this, Jenny Hazelgrove has noted: The psychical researcher Simeon Edmunds also noted that spiritualists have a history of ignoring the evidence of fraud in the Duncan case. He criticized the spiritualist press such as Psychic News for biased reporting and distorting facts. Science writer Mary Roach in her book Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife (2007) favorably mentioned Price's methods in debunking Duncan as a fraudulent medium. Richard Denham's book Weird War Two focuses on the absurdity of Duncan being charged and convicted as a witch in the paranoia of wartime Britain, particularly the frustration of Winston Churchill, who himself had been ordained into the Ancient Order of Druids Inspired by her legacy, new wave of British heavy metal band Seventh Son recorded and released a song 'The Last Witch In England' in 2009, depicting her life and her 'prediction' of the sinking of HMS Barham. The naval investigation and subsequent trial was dramatized as a radio play. The Last Witch Trial by Melissa Murray, starring Joanna Monro as Duncan and Indira Varma as the undercover investigator, was broadcast by BBC Radio 4 on 4 June 2010. Descendants and supporters of Duncan have campaigned on several occasions to have her posthumously pardoned of witchcraft charges. Petitions for a posthumous pardon were rejected by the Scottish Parliament in 2001, 2008, and 2012. Duncan's supporters maintain a website and online petition where they continue to campaign for her pardon. Notes References * Mary Armour. (2001). Helen Duncan: My Living Has Not Been in Vain.

Through the merger of three previously independent organizations, JAXA was formed on 1 October 2003. JAXA is responsible for research, technology development and launch of satellites into orbit, and is involved in many more advanced missions such as asteroid exploration and possible human exploration of the Moon. Its motto is One JAXA and its corporate slogan is Explore to Realize (formerly Reaching for the skies, exploring space).  History  Kibo, the largest module of the ISS. On 1 October 2003, three organisations were merged to form the new JAXA: Japan's Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), the National Aerospace Laboratory of Japan (NAL), and National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA). JAXA was formed as an Independent Administrative Institution administered by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC). Before the merger, ISAS was responsible for space and planetary research, while NAL was focused on aviation research. NASDA, which was founded on 1 October 1969, had developed rockets, satellites, and also built the Japanese Experiment Module. The old NASDA headquarters were located at the current site of the Tanegashima Space Center, on Tanegashima Island, 115 kilometers south of Ky≈´sh≈´. NASDA also trained the Japanese astronauts who flew with the US Space Shuttles.Kamiya, Setsuko, \\"Japan a low-key player in space race \\", Japan Times, 30 June 2009, p. 3. The Basic Space Law was passed in 2008, and the jurisdictional authority of JAXA moved from MEXT to the Strategic Headquarters for Space Development (SHSD) in the Cabinet, led by the Prime Minister. In 2016, the National Space Policy Secretariat (NSPS) was set up the Cabinet. An overview of Japan‚Äôs space activities, 14 August 2018. Planning interplanetary research missions can take up to seven years, such as the ASTRO-E. Due to the lag time between these interplanetary events and mission planning time, opportunities to gain new knowledge about the cosmos might be lost. To prevent this, JAXA plans on using smaller, faster missions from 2010 onward. In 2012, new legislation extended JAXA's remit from peaceful purposes only to include some military space development, such as missile early warning systems. Political control of JAXA passed from MEXT to the Prime Minister's Cabinet Office through a new Space Strategy Office.  Organisation  Head Office. Tanegashima Space Center. JAXA is composed of the following organisations: * Space Technology Directorate I * Space Technology Directorate II * Human Spaceflight Technology Directorate * Research and Development Directorate * Aeronautical Technology Directorate * Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) * Space Exploration Innovation Hub Center JAXA has research centres in many locations in Japan, and some offices overseas. Its headquarters are in Ch≈çfu, Tokyo. It also has * Earth Observation Research Center (EORC), Tokyo * Earth Observation Center (EOC) in Hatoyama, Saitama * Noshiro Testing Center (NTC) in Noshiro, Akita ‚Äì Established in 1962. It carries out development and testing of rocket engines. * Sanriku Balloon Center (SBC) ‚Äì Balloons have been launched from this site since 1971. * Kakuda Space Center (KSPC) in Kakuda, Miyagi ‚Äì Leads the development of rocket engines. Works mainly with development of liquid-fuel engines. * Sagamihara Campus (ISAS) in Sagamihara, Kanagawa ‚Äì Development of experimental equipment for rockets and satellites. Also administrative buildings. * Tanegashima Space Center in Tanegashima, Kagoshima ‚Äì currently the launch site for the H-IIA and H-IIB rockets. * Tsukuba Space Center (TKSC) in Tsukuba, Ibaraki. This is the center of Japan's space network. It is involved in research and development of satellites and rockets, and tracking and controlling of satellites. It develops experimental equipment for the Japanese Experiment Module (\\"Kibo\\"). Training of astronauts also takes place here. For International Space Station operations, the Japanese Flight Control Team is located at the Space Station Integration & Promotion Center (SSIPC) in Tsukuba. SSIPC communicates regularly with ISS crewmembers via S-band audio. * Uchinoura Space Center in Kimotsuki, Kagoshima ‚Äì currently the launch site for the Epsilon rocket.  Rockets  JAXA uses the H-IIA (H \\"two\\" A) rocket from the former NASDA body and its variant H-IIB to launch engineering test satellites, weather satellites, etc. For science missions like X-ray astronomy, JAXA uses the Epsilon rocket. For experiments in the upper atmosphere JAXA uses the SS-520, S-520, and S-310 sounding rockets. Communication ground stations for interplanetary spacecraft  Successes  Prior to the establishment of JAXA, ISAS had been most successful in its space program in the field of X-ray astronomy during the 1980s and 1990s. Another successful area for Japan has been Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) with the HALCA mission. Additional success was achieved with solar observation and research of the magnetosphere, among other areas. NASDA was mostly active in the field of communication satellite technology. However, since the satellite market of Japan is completely open, the first time a Japanese company won a contract for a civilian communication satellite was in 2005. Another prime focus of the NASDA body is Earth climate observation. JAXA was awarded the Space Foundation's John L. \\"Jack\\" Swigert, Jr., Award for Space Exploration in 2008.  Launch development  H-IIA & H-IIB. Japan launched its first satellite, Ohsumi, in 1970, using ISAS' L-4S rocket. Prior to the merger, ISAS used small solid-fueled launch vehicles, while NASDA developed larger liquid-fueled launchers. In the beginning, NASDA used licensed American models. The first model of liquid-fuelled launch vehicle indigenously developed in Japan was the H-II, introduced in 1994. However, at the end of the 1990s, with two H-II launch failures, Japanese rocket technology began to face criticism. Japan's first space mission under JAXA, an H-IIA rocket launch on 29 November 2003, ended in failure due to stress problems. After a 15-month hiatus, JAXA performed a successful launch of an H-IIA rocket from Tanegashima Space Center, placing a satellite into orbit on 26 February 2005. To be able to launch smaller mission on JAXA developed a new solid-fueled rocket, the Epsilon as a replacement to the retired M-V. The maiden flight successfully happened in 2013. So far, the rocket has flown four times without any launch failures. In January 2017, JAXA attempted and failed to put a miniature satellite into orbit atop one of its SS520 series rockets. A second attempt on February 2, 2018 was successful, putting a four kilogram CubeSat into Earth orbit. The rocket, known as the SS-520-5, is the world's smallest orbital launcher.  Lunar and interplanetary missions  Japan's first missions beyond Earth orbit were the 1985 Halley's comet observation satellites Sakigake (MS-T5) and Suisei (PLANET-A). To prepare for future missions, ISAS tested Earth swing by orbits with the Hiten mission in 1990. The first Japanese interplanetary mission was the Mars Orbiter Nozomi (PLANET-B), which was launched in 1998. It passed Mars in 2003, but failed to reach Mars orbit due to maneuvering systems failures earlier in the mission. Currently interplanetary missions remain at the ISAS group under the JAXA umbrella. However, for FY 2008 JAXA is planning to set up an independent working group within the organization. New head for this group will be Hayabusa project manager Kawaguchi.Agency‚Äôs Report from ISAS/JAXA to ILWS WG meeting , Living With a Star, July 23, 2006 Active Missions: PLANET-C, IKAROS, Hayabusa 2 Under Development: SLIM, MMX, DESTINY+ Retired: PLANET-B, SELENE, MUSES-C Cancelled: LUNAR-A  Small body exploration: Hayabusa mission  Hayabusa On 9 May 2003, Hayabusa (meaning, Peregrine falcon), was launched from an M-V rocket. The goal of the mission was to collect samples from a small near-Earth asteroid named 25143 Itokawa. The craft rendezvoused with the asteroid in September 2005. It was confirmed that the spacecraft successfully landed on the asteroid in November 2005, after some initial confusion regarding the incoming data. Hayabusa returned to Earth with samples from the asteroid on 13 June 2010.  Lunar explorations  After Hiten in 1990, ISAS planned a lunar penetrator mission called LUNAR-A but after delays due to technical problems, the project was terminated in January 2007. The seismometer penetrator design for LUNAR-A may be reused in a future mission. On 14 September 2007, JAXA succeeded in launching the lunar orbit explorer Kaguya, also known as SELENE (costing 55 billion yen including launch vehicle), the largest such mission since the Apollo programme, on an H-2A rocket. Its mission is to gather data on the Moon's origin and evolution. It entered lunar orbit on 4 October 2007. After 1 year and 8 months it impacted the lunar surface on 10 June 2009 at 18:25 UTC. JAXA plans to launch its first lunar surface mission, SLIM (Smart Lander for Investigating Moon) on an Epsilon rocket in fiscal year 2019.  Planetary exploration  Japan's planetary missions have so far been limited to the inner Solar System, and emphasis has been put on magnetospheric and atmospheric research. The Mars explorer Nozomi (PLANET-B), which ISAS launched prior to the merger of the three aerospace institutes, became one of the earliest difficulties the newly formed JAXA faced. Nozomi ultimately passed 1,000 km from the surface of Mars. On 20 May 2010, the Venus Climate Orbiter Akatsuki (PLANET-C) and IKAROS solar sail demonstrator was launched by a H-2A launch vehicle. On 7 December 2010, Akatsuki was unable to complete its Venus orbit insertion maneuver. Akatsuki finally entered Venus orbit on 7 December 2015, making it the first Japanese spacecraft to orbit another planet, sixteen years after the originally planned orbital insertion of Nozomi. One of Akatsuki's main goal is to uncover the mechanism behind Venus atmosphere's super-rotation, a phenomenon in which the cloud top winds in the troposphere circulates around the planet faster than the speed that Venus itself rotates. A thorough explanation for this phenomenon has yet been found. JAXA/ISAS was part of the international Laplace Jupiter mission proposal from its foundation. A Japanese contribution was sought in the form of an independent orbiter to research Jupiter's magnetosphere, JMO (Jupiter Magnetospheric Orbiter). Although JMO never left the conception phase, ISAS scientists will see their instruments reaching Jupiter on the ESA-led JUICE (Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer) mission. JUICE is a reformulation of the ESA Ganymede orbiter from the Laplace project. JAXA's contribution includes providing components of the RPWI (Radio & Plasma Wave Investigation), PEP (Particle Environment Package), GALA (GAnymede Laser Altimeter) instruments. JAXA is reviewing a new spacecraft mission to the Martian system; a sample return mission to Phobos called MMX (Martian Moons Explorer). First revealed on 9 June 2015, MMX's primary goal is to determine the origin of the Martian moons. Alongside collecting samples from Phobos, MMX will perform remote sensing of Deimos, and may also observe the atmosphere of Mars as well. As of January 2016, MMX is to be launched in fiscal year 2022.  Solar sail research  On 9 August 2004, ISAS successfully deployed two prototype solar sails from a sounding rocket. A clover-type sail was deployed at 122 km altitude and a fan type sail was deployed at 169 km altitude. Both sails used 7.5 micrometer-thick film. ISAS tested a solar sail again as a sub- payload to the Akari (ASTRO-F) mission on 22 February 2006. However the solar sail did not deploy fully. ISAS tested a solar sail again as a sub payload of the SOLAR-B launch at 23 September 2006, but contact with the probe was lost. The IKAROS solar sail was launched on 21 May 2010. The solar sail deployed successfully. The goal is to have a solar sail mission to Jupiter after 2020.  Astronomy program  The first Japanese astronomy mission was x-ray satellite Hakucho (Corsa-B), which was launched in 1979. Later ISAS moved into solar observation, radio astronomy through Space VLBI and infrared astronomy. Active Missions: SOLAR-B, MAXI, SPRINT-A, and CALET Under Development: XRISM Retired: ASTRO-F, ASTRO-EII, and ASTRO-H Cancelled: ASTRO-G  Infrared astronomy  ASTRO-E. Japan's first infrared astronomy mission was the 15-cm IRTS telescope which was part of the SFU multipurpose satellite in 1995. IRTS scanned during its one-month lifetime around 7% of the sky before SFU got brought back to Earth by the Space Shuttle. During the 1990s JAXA also gave ground support for the ESA Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) infrared mission. The next step for JAXA was the Akari spacecraft, with the pre-launch designation ASTRO-F. This satellite was launched on 21 February 2006. Its mission is infrared astronomy with a 68 cm telescope. This is the first all sky survey since the first infrared mission IRAS in 1983. (A 3.6 kg nanosatellite named CUTE-1.7 was also released from the same launch vehicle.)Akari, NSSDCA JAXA is also doing further R&D; for increasing the performance of its mechanical coolers for its future infrared mission, SPICA. This would enable a warm launch without liquid helium. SPICA has the same size as the ESA Herschel Space Observatory mission, but is planned to have a temperature of just 4.5 K and will be much colder. Unlike Akari, which had a geocentric orbit, SPICA will be located at Sun‚ÄìEarth . The launch is expected in 2027 or 2028 on JAXA's new H3 Launch Vehicle, however the mission is not yet fully funded. ESA and NASA may also each contribute an instrument.  X-ray astronomy  Starting from 1979 with Hakucho (CORSA-b), for nearly two decades Japan had achieved continuous observation with its Hinotori, Tenma, Ginga and ASCA (ASTRO-A through D) x-ray observation satellites. However, in the year 2000 the launch of Japan's fifth x-ray observation satellite, ASTRO-E failed (as it failed at launch it never received a proper name). Then on 10 July 2005, JAXA was finally able to launch a new X-ray astronomy mission named Suzaku (ASTRO-EII). This launch was important for JAXA, because in the five years since the launch failure of the original ASTRO-E satellite, Japan was without an x-ray telescope. Three instruments were included in this satellite: an X-ray spectrometer (XRS), an X-ray imaging spectrometer (XIS), and a hard X-ray detector (HXD). However, the XRS was rendered inoperable due to a malfunction which caused the satellite to lose its supply of liquid helium. The next JAXA x-ray mission is the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI). MAXI continuously monitors astronomical X-ray objects over a broad energy band (0.5 to 30 keV). MAXI is installed on the Japanese external module of the ISS. On 17 February 2016, Hitomi (ASTRO-H) was launched as the successor to Suzaku, which completed its mission a year before.  Solar observation  Japan's solar astronomy started in the early 1980s with the launch of the Hinotori (ASTRO-A) x-ray mission. The Hinode (SOLAR-B) spacecraft, the follow-on to the joint Japan/US/UK Yohkoh (SOLAR-A) spacecraft, was launched on 23 September 2006. A SOLAR-C can be expected sometime after 2020. However no details are worked out yet other than it will not be launched with the former ISAS's Mu rockets. Instead a H-2A from Tanegashima could launch it. As H-2A is more powerful, SOLAR-C could either be heavier or be stationed at (Lagrange point 1).  Radio astronomy  In 1998 Japan launched the HALCA (MUSES-B) Mission, the world's first spacecraft dedicated to conduct SPACE VLBI observations of pulsars, among others. To do so, ISAS set up a ground network around the world through international cooperation. The observation part of the mission lasted until 2003 and the satellite was retired at the end of 2005. In FY 2006 Japan funded the ASTRO-G as the succeeding mission.  Communication, positioning and technology tests  One of the primary duties of the former NASDA body was the testing of new space technologies, mostly in the field of communication. The first test satellite was ETS-I, launched in 1975. However, during the 1990s NASDA was afflicted by problems surrounding the ETS-VI and COMETS missions. In February 2018, JAXA announced a research collaboration with Sony to test a laser communication system from the Kibo module in late 2018. Testing of communication technologies remains to be one of JAXA's key duties in cooperation with NICT. Active Missions: INDEX, QZS-1, SLATS, QZS-2, QZS-3, QZS-4 Under Development: ETS-IX Retired: OICETS, ETS-VIII, WINDS  i-Space : ETS-VIII, WINDS and QZS-1  To upgrade Japan's communication technology the Japanese state launched the i-Space initiative with the ETS-VIII and WINDS missions. ETS-VIII was launched on 18 December 2006. The purpose of ETS-VIII is to test communication equipment with two very large antennas and an atomic clock test. On 26 December both antennas were successfully deployed. This was not unexpected, since JAXA tested the deployment mechanism before with the LDREX-2 Mission, which was launched on 14 October with the European Ariane 5. The test was successful. The mission of WINDS (Kizuna) is to create the world's fastest satellite Internet connection. WINDS was launched in February 2008.  OICETS and INDEX  On 24 August 2005, JAXA launched the experimental satellites OICETS and INDEX on a Ukrainian Dnepr rocket. OICETS (Kirari) is a mission tasked with testing optical links with the European Space Agency (ESA) ARTEMIS satellite, which is around 40,000 km away from OICETS. The experiment was successful on 9 December, when the link could be established. In March 2006 JAXA could establish with OICETS the worldwide first optical links between a LEO satellite and a ground station first in Japan and in June 2006 with a mobile station in Germany. INDEX (Reimei) is a small 70 kg satellite for testing various equipment, and functions as an aurora observation mission as well. The Reimei satellite is currently in its extended mission phase.  Earth observation programme  Japan's first Earth observation satellites were MOS-1a and MOS-1b launched in 1987 and 1990. During the 1990s and the new millennium this programme came under heavy fire, because both Adeos (Midori) and Adeos 2 (Midori 2) satellites failed after just ten months in orbit. Active Missions: GOSAT, GCOM-W, ALOS-2, GCOM-C, GOSAT-2 Under Development: ALOS-3 Retired: ALOS  ALOS  MTSAT-1 In January 2006, JAXA successfully launched the Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS/Daichi). Communication between ALOS and the ground station in Japan will be done through the Kodama Data Relay Satellite, which was launched during 2002. This project is under intense pressure due to the shorter than expected lifetime of the ADEOS II (Midori) Earth Observation Mission. For missions following Daichi, JAXA opted to separate it into a radar satellite (ALOS-2) and an optical satellite (ALOS-3). ALOS 2 SAR was launched in May 2014.  Rainfall observation  Since Japan is an island nation and gets struck by typhoons every year, research about the dynamics of the atmosphere is a very important issue. For this reason Japan launched in 1997 the TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) satellite in cooperation with NASA, to observe the tropical rainfall seasons. For further research NASDA had launched the ADEOS and ADEOS II missions in 1996 and 2003. However, due to various reasons, both satellites had a much shorter than expected life term. On 28 February 2014, a H-2A rocket launched the GPM Core Observatory, a satellite jointly developed by JAXA and NASA. The GPM mission is the successor to the TRMM mission, which by the time of the GPM launch had been noted as highly successful. JAXA provided the Global Precipitation Measurement/Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (GPM/DPR) Instrument for this mission. Global Precipitation Measurement itself is a satellite constellation, whilst the GPM Core Observatory provides a new calibration standard for other satellites in the constellation. Other countries/agencies like France, India, ESA, etc. provides the sub-satellites. The aim of GPM is to measure global rainfall with unprecedented detail.  Monitoring of carbon dioxide  At the end of the 2008 fiscal year, JAXA launched the satellite GOSAT (Greenhouse Gas Observing SATellite) to help scientists determine and monitor the density distribution of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The satellite is being jointly developed by JAXA and Japan's Ministry of the Environment. JAXA is building the satellite while the Ministry is in charge of the data that will be collected. Since the number of ground-based carbon dioxide observatories cannot monitor enough of the world's atmosphere and are distributed unevenly throughout the globe, the GOSAT may be able to gather more accurate data and fill in the gaps on the globe where there are no observatories on the ground. Sensors for methane and other greenhouse gasses are also being considered for the satellite, although the plans are not yet finalized. The satellite weighs approximately 1650 kg and is expected to have a life span of five years.  GCOM series  The next funded Earth-observation mission after GOSAT is the GCOM (Global Change Observation Mission) Earth-observation programme as a successor to ADEOS II (Midori) and the Aqua mission. To reduce the risk and for a longer observation time the mission will be split into smaller satellites. Altogether GCOM will be a series of six satellites. The first satellite, GCOM-W (Shizuku), was launched on 17 May 2012 with the H-IIA. The launch of the second satellite, GCOM-C, is currently planned for 2017.  Satellites for other agencies  For weather observation Japan launched in February 2005 the Multi-Functional Transport Satellite 1R (MTSAT-1R). The success of this launch was critical for Japan, since the original MTSAT-1 could not be put into orbit because of a launch failure with the H-2 rocket in 1999. Since then Japan relied for weather forecasting on an old satellite which was already beyond its useful life term and on American systems. On 18 February 2006, JAXA, as head of the H-IIA at this time, successfully launched the MTSAT-2 aboard a H-2A rocket. MTSAT-2 is the backup to the MTSAT-1R. The MTSAT-2 uses the DS-2000 satellite bus developed by Mitsubishi Electric. The DS-2000 is also used for the DRTS Kodama, ETS-VIII and the Superbird 7 communication satellite, making it the first commercial success for Japan. As a secondary mission both the MTSAT-1R and MTSAT-2 help to direct air traffic.  Other JAXA satellites currently in use  * GEOTAIL magnetosphere observation satellite (since 1992) * DRTS (Kodama) Data Relay Satellite, since 2002. (Projected Life Span is seven years) Ongoing joint missions with NASA are the Aqua Earth Observation Satellite, and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Core satellite.JAXA also provided the Light Particle Telescope (LPT) for the 2008 Jason 2 satellite by the French CNES. On May 11, 2018 JAXA has launched the first outer-space object registered by Kenya. Satellite 1KUNS-PF created by University of Nairobi was launched from the Japanese Experiment Module of the International Space Station.

The launch, using H-IIA launch vehicle 14, took place from the Tanegashima Space Center. On 10 September 2009 the first H-IIB rocket was successfully launched, delivering the HTV-1 freighter to resupply the International Space Station. In the year 2009 JAXA plans to launch the first satellite of the Quasi Zenith Satellite System (QZSS), a subsystem of the global positioning system (GPS). Two others are expected to follow later. If successful, one satellite will be in a zenith position over Japan full-time. The QZSS mission is the last scheduled major independent mission for JAXA, as no major civilian projects were funded after that for now. The only exception is the IGS programme which will be continued beyond 2008. However it seems Japan is pressing forward now with the GCOM earth observation satellites as successors to the ADEOS missions. First launch is planned for 2010. In 2009 Japan also plans to launch a new version of the IGS with an improved resolution of 60 cm.  Launch schedule  The maiden flight of the H-IIB and the HTV occurred on 1 September 2009.

A potentially crewed spaceplane HOPE-X project launched by the conventional space launcher H-II was developed for several years (including test flights of HYFLEX/OREX prototypes) but was postponed. The simpler crewed capsule Fuji was proposed but not adopted. Projects for single-stage to orbit, horizontal takeoff reusable launch vehicle and landing ASSTS and the vertical takeoff and landing Kankoh-maru also exist but have not been adopted. The first Japanese citizen to fly in space was Toyohiro Akiyama, a journalist sponsored by TBS, who flew on the Soviet Soyuz TM-11 in December 1990. He spent more than seven days in space on the Mir space station, in what the Soviets called their first commercial spaceflight which allowed them to earn $14 million. Japan participates in US and international crewed space programs including flights of Japanese astronauts on Russian Soyuz spacecraft to the ISS. One Space Shuttle mission (STS-47) in September 1992 was partially funded by Japan. This flight included JAXA's first astronaut in space, Mamoru Mohri, as the Payload Specialist for the Spacelab-J, one of the European built Spacelab modules. This mission was also designated Japan. A view of the completed Kibo module of the ISS. Three other NASA Space Shuttle missions (STS-123, STS-124, STS-127) in 2008‚Äì2009 delivered parts of the Japanese built spacelab-module Kibo to ISS. Japanese plans for a crewed lunar landing were in development but were shelved in early 2010 due to budget constraints.McPherson, S. (23 March 2010). Japan Decides Manned Mission to Moon Too Expensive, Nikkei Says. Retrieved from In June 2014 Japan's science and technology ministry said it was considering a space mission to Mars. In a ministry paper it indicated uncrewed exploration, crewed missions to Mars and long-term settlement on the Moon were objectives, for which international cooperation and support was going to be sought. On 18 October 2017, Japanese discovery of a \\"tunnel\\" under the surface of the Moon has led to press-release. The tunnel seems suitable as a location for a base-of-operations for peaceful crewed space missions, according to JAXA.  Supersonic aircraft development  Besides the H-IIA/B and Epsilon rockets, JAXA is also developing technology for a next-generation supersonic transport that could become the commercial replacement for the Concorde. The design goal of the project (working name Next Generation Supersonic Transport) is to develop a jet that can carry 300 passengers at Mach 2. A subscale model of the jet underwent aerodynamic testing in September and October 2005 in Australia.Supersonic Jet 10 October 2005, yahoo In 2015 JAXA performed tests aimed at reducing the effects of supersonic flight under the D-SEND program. The economic success of such a project is still unclear, and as a consequence the project has been met with limited interest from Japanese aerospace companies like Mitsubishi Heavy Industries so far.  Reusable launch vehicles  Until 2003, JAXA (ISAS) conducted research on a reusable launch vehicle under the Reusable Vehicle Testing (RVT) project.

The quartet won the 1950 International Championship and is well known for appearing in the 1957 Broadway production and the 1962 film version of The Music Man. Origins The quartet started out as an unnamed foursome, singing for community groups around Buffalo. The original members were tenor Vern Reed, an executive for the Tonawanda Boys' Club;p.148 Averill, Gage Four parts, no waiting: a social history of American barbershop harmony 2003 Oxford University Press lead Al Shea, who was a City of Buffalo policeman; baritone Herschel Smith, a corporate executive; and bass Bill Spangenberg, a truck driver for a steel company. During an appearance at the Buffalo Quarterback Club, the nameless quartet was introduced as the \\"Buffalo Bills\\", which was meant to be just for the occasion, but the name stuck from that day on. Coincidentally, a football team known formerly as the Buffalo Bisons also changed its name to the Bills around the same time; the name proved popular enough that the current Buffalo Bills team also picked up the name when they debuted thirteen years later. Phil Embury traveled with the quartet around the world. The Bills competed in the 1948 and 1949 SPEBSQSA International Quartet Contests, placing sixteenth and sixth, respectively. Champions Baritone Herschel Smith left the quartet after he received a job promotion and was transferred to Madison, Wisconsin. Unable to find a replacement, the Bills temporarily broke up. They soon found baritone Dick Grapes and success quickly followed. In 1950, the Bills won the Barbershop Harmony Society International Quartet Contest, earning them the title of International Quartet Champions. Soon after their victory, they appeared on the national radio program We The People and were honored by the Manhattan and Buffalo chapters on their return trip to their hometown. Their first national television appearance was on The Faye Emerson Pepsi-Cola Show broadcast on CBS in April 1951. The Bills also performed at military bases in France, Germany, Austria, Japan, and Korea. That same year of 1951, the Bills released an eight-song LP album for Decca titled Barbershop Gems which was also issued on 45 and 78 RPM records. Discovery In the early 1950s, composer and bandleader Meredith Willson hosted a radio program called Music Today with his wife, Rini. Hearing the Bills records, he began to admire their work, and he and his wife travelled to Buffalo three years later to meet them. Afterwards, he began featuring the quartet regularly on his radio show.p.149 Averill, Gage Four parts, no waiting: a social history of American barbershop harmony. 2003, Oxford University Press In February 1957, the Buffalo Bills competed on Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts, won first honors, and received an invitation to perform on Godfrey's morning show for the rest of the week. Later that year, Willson finished writing his new musical play, The Music Man, which featured a barbershop quartet in the plot. Willson suggested the Bills come to New York City and audition for the show. They were immediately accepted, but joining the musical meant they would all have to quit their jobs in Buffalo and relocate to New York City. Broadway and film In the end, Dick Grapes decided to stay behind with his job and family life and was replaced by veteran barbershop baritone Wayne \\"Scotty\\" Ward of the Great Scots quartet of Steubenville, Ohio. The quartet took one-year leaves from their jobs (which later became permanent) and moved with their families to New York City.p.151 Averill, Gage Four parts, no waiting: a social history of American barbershop harmony 2003 Oxford University Press They continued to make television and radio appearances, including the Arthur Godfrey show, where they met Walter Latzko, a CBS staff music arranger. They were such a hit in The Music Man on Broadway, that they were cast in the film adaptation of the musical in 1962. Shortly after the film was completed, Bill Spangenberg became ill and was forced to leave the quartet; he died in 1963. Spangenberg was replaced by Jim Jones, bass of the Sta-Laters quartet. Final years For the next five years, the Buffalo Bills continued to perform regularly on the Arthur Godfrey Show, appeared as a nightclub act, performed in regional and amateur productions of The Music Man and were headline entertainers at barbershop conventions and shows, as well as at state and county fairs around the US and Canada. Their total career consisted of 1,510 performances on Broadway, 728 concerts, 675 radio shows, 672 night club and hotel appearances, 626 conventions, 218 television shows, 137 state fair performances, and 1 film. Internal issues and some health problems among the members caused the quartet to disband in 1967. The Buffalo Bills made their final official appearance on May 24, 1967 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York. Al Shea and Vern Reed were the only members with the Buffalo Bills throughout their entire 20-year existence. The last surviving member of the quartet is Jim Jones, who lives in Orlando, Florida.Shea died in 1968, Ward in 1988, Reed in 1992, Smith in 2007, and Grapes in 2015.

This treaty resolved standing boundary issues between the two nations. The treaty allowed for joint occupation and settlement of the Oregon Country, known to the British and in Canadian history as the Columbia District of the Hudson's Bay Company, and including the southern portion of its sister district New Caledonia. The two nations agreed to a boundary line involving the 49th parallel north, in part because a straight-line boundary would be easier to survey than the pre-existing boundaries based on watersheds. The treaty marked both the United Kingdom's last permanent major loss of territory in what is now the Continental United States and the United States' only permanent significant cession of North American territory to a foreign power. The British ceded all of Rupert's Land south of the 49th parallel and east of the Continental Divide, including all of the Red River Colony south of that latitude, while the United States ceded the northernmost edge of the Missouri Territory north of the 49th parallel. Treaty provisions The treaty name is variously cited as \\"Convention respecting fisheries, boundary, and the restoration of slaves\\", \\"Convention of Commerce (Fisheries, Boundary and the Restoration of Slaves)\\", and \\"Convention of Commerce between His Majesty and the United States of America\\". * Article I secured fishing rights along Newfoundland and Labrador for the U.S. * Article II set the boundary between British North America and the United States along \\"a line drawn from the most northwestern point of the Lake of the Woods, [due south, then] along the 49th parallel of north latitude...\\" to the \\"Stony Mountains\\" (now known as the Rocky Mountains). Britain ceded all territory south of the 49th parallel, including portions of the Red River Colony and Rupert's Land (comprising parts of the present states of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota). The United States ceded the portion of the Louisiana Purchase lying north of the 49th parallel (the northernmost portion of the Mississippi River watershed, including those parts of the Milk River, Poplar River, and Big Muddy Creek watersheds in modern-day Alberta and Saskatchewan). This article settled a boundary dispute caused by ignorance of actual geography in the boundary agreed to in the 1783 Treaty of Paris that ended the American Revolutionary War. That earlier treaty had placed the boundary between the United States and British North America along a line extending westward from the Lake of the Woods to the Mississippi River. The parties did not realize that the river did not extend that far north, so such a line would never meet the river. In fixing this problem, the 1818 treaty created a pene-enclave of the United States, the Northwest Angle, which is the small section of the present state of Minnesota that is the only part of the United States apart from Alaska lying north of the 49th parallel. *Article III provided for joint control of land in the Oregon Country for ten years. Both could claim land and both were guaranteed free navigation throughout. *Article IV confirmed the Anglo- American Convention of 1815,Article on \\"The Convention of 1815\\", The Marine Journal, June 3, 1922 which regulated commerce between the two parties, for an additional ten years. *Article V agreed to refer differences over a U.S. claim arising from the Treaty of Ghent, which ended the War of 1812, to \\"some Friendly Sovereign or State to be named for that purpose.\\" The U.S. claim was for return of, or compensation for, slaves that were in British territory or on British naval vessels when the treaty was signed. The Treaty of Ghent article in question was about handing over property, and the U.S. claimed that these slaves were the property of U.S. citizens. *Article VI established that ratification would occur within at most six months of signing the treaty. History Albert Gallatin (1848 photograph) The treaty was negotiated for the U.S. by Albert Gallatin, ambassador to France, and Richard Rush, minister to the UK; and for the UK by Frederick John Robinson, Treasurer of the Royal Navy and member of the privy council, and Henry Goulburn, an undersecretary of state. The treaty was signed on October 20, 1818. Ratifications were exchanged on January 30, 1819. The Convention of 1818, along with the Rush‚ÄìBagot Treaty of 1817, marked the beginning of improved relations between the British Empire and its former colonies, and paved the way for more positive relations between the U.S. and Canada, notwithstanding that repelling U.S. invasion was a defense priority in Canada until 1928.Preston, Richard A. The Defence of the Undefended Border: Planning for War in North America 1867‚Äì1939, McGill-Queen‚Äôs University Press, 1977 Despite the relatively friendly nature of the agreement, it nevertheless resulted in a fierce struggle for control of the Oregon Country in the following two decades. The British-chartered Hudson's Bay Company, having previously established a trading network centered on Fort Vancouver on the lower Columbia River, with other forts in what is now eastern Washington and Idaho as well as on the Oregon Coast and in Puget Sound, undertook a harsh campaign to restrict encroachment by U.S. fur traders to the area. By the 1830s, with pressure in the U.S. mounting to annex the region outright, the company undertook a deliberate policy to exterminate all fur- bearing animals from the Oregon Country, in order to both maximize its remaining profit and to delay the arrival of U.S. mountain men and settlers. The policy of discouraging settlement was undercut to some degree by the actions of John McLoughlin, Chief Factor of the Hudson's Bay Company at Fort Vancouver, who regularly provided relief and welcome to U.S. immigrants who had arrived at the post over the Oregon Trail. By the middle 1840s, the tide of U.S. immigration, as well as a U.S. political movement to claim the entire territory, led to a renegotiation of the agreement. The Oregon Treaty in 1846 permanently established the 49th parallel as the boundary between the United States and British North America to the Pacific Ocean.

Al-Sadr had previously stated that he would have worked with Ayatollah Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim if Ayatollah Haeri had ordered it. Recently, Muqtada al-Sadr and Abdul-Aziz al-Hakim signed a pact to end all potential hostilities between the two camps. Haeri has also issued fatwas against the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq, but he publicly criticized Muqtada al-Sadr for potential weakening against the Shi'a establishment and its hierarchy in Najaf under the guise of anti-Americanism in April 2004 while taking Haeri's name.Muqtada al-Sadr ignores fatwa against secularist candidates See also * List of current Maraji * Ayatollah * Marja' References External links * Official Website * 2nd Official Website Iranian ayatollahs Iraqi ayatollahs Iraqi Shia Muslims Living people 1938 births Islamic Dawa Party ","title":"Kazem al-Haeri"},{"id":"716244","text":"St Peter's School is a co-educational independent boarding and day school (also referred to as a public school), in the English City of York, with extensive grounds on the banks of the River Ouse. Founded by St Paulinus of York in AD 627, it is the third oldest school in the UK and the fourth oldest in the world. It is part of the York Boarding Schools Group. History St Peter's School St Peter's School, York in Founded in the English city of York by St Paulinus of York in the year AD 627, the school was originally based at York Minster. An early headmaster Alcuin (Flaccus Albinus Alcuinus), went on to be Chancellor to the Emperor Charlemagne, and founded several of the earliest schools in mainland Europe. It is the third oldest school in the UK and the fourth oldest in the world.Mortimore, M.J.A. Bridlington School: A History, p. 13. Hutton Cranswick, East Yorkshire: Alan Twiddle Publishing, 1999. . For most of its history, the school was a boys' school, but admitted girls into the sixth form from 1976, following a trend set by many previously single-sex independent schools. In 1987 it became fully coeducational.About the school ‚Äì Timeline Campus The school grounds are located near the centre of York and stretch to the banks of the River Ouse. The main front of the school faces along Bootham; this is the oldest part of the site and comprises the Memorial Hall, Alcuin Library and Chapel, as well as dining facilities. Temple House and School House, the Department of Politics, the Department of Business, the Department of Economics, and the Department of Latin and Classics are also based in these buildings, accessed from an area known to the school community as the 'monkey cage'. Behind here is the Pascal building (Maths), Old Science Building (Chemistry), New Science Building (Physics, IT, and DT), Shepherd Rooms (Languages), The Grove and Clifton House. The Music School, the Dame Judi Dench Drama Centre, Hope House, and Queen's Building (History, Religious Studies, and English) are also located along the top of the Campus. Boarding Houses Wentworth and Rise border the main campus, while Linton, Dronfield and The Manor are located across the road from the main school front accessible by footbridge. In the 2000s the school expanded its site under Headmaster Andrew Trotman to include the new lower campus, formally the site of Queen Anne's, a state school that had been recently closed. The move was not without its challenges, including the distance between the old and new sites and the dissection of a public footpath. St Olave's St Olave's School is the junior school to St Peter's, with grounds on the banks of the River Ouse. In September 2001, St Olave's moved from the White House (the Chilman Building), and its half of the Queen's Building, to the newly acquired Queen Anne site. The pre-prep, Clifton Prep moved from its original 19th-century building on The Avenue to occupy the buildings previously used by St Olave's. St Olave's was founded by Reverend Henry Andrew Wilson in 1876 and named after its original site of St Olave‚Äôs House in Marygate. The school was acquired by St Peter's in 1901. The head of St Olave's is referred to as the \\"school master\\", while the head of senior school is referred to as the \\"Head Master\\". As of 2019, the master of St Olave's is Andy Falconer.https://www.york.ac.uk/archaeology/about- us/department/daab/andy-falconer/ The Lower Campus in 2019 contains St Olave's prep school and the senior school of Biology and Art Departments. In 2006, St Peter's School closed a public footpath running through the school grounds using The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. This was hotly disputed by local people. Academic The school has a history of high academic achievement across all age ranges.High Grades2St Peter's academic ratings High Grades1 Language-learning is also encouraged from a young age,as the teaching of Latin, which is compulsory for the first four years of studySt Olave's and also offered at GCSE and A Level.St Peters school Religious Studies is a compulsory GCSE subject.Religious Studies at St Peter's School Sport A wide range of activities are available at the school: these include rugby, football, hockey, netball, tennis, cricket, rowing, athletics, basketball, badminton, cross-country, climbing, squash, swimming, weight training, trampolining, water polo and aerobics. The school has sporting fields, gymnasiums, an indoor swimming pool, two multi-sport indoor centres, tennis courts, multi-use astroturf pitches, a rifle range, and a boathouse. For 27 years, cricket was coached by Keith Mohan. In 2002 the school's U15 rugby team won the national Daily Mail Cup competition and the U18 team were narrowly beaten in 2005 in the final against Exeter College, Exeter . In 2011 the U16 team won the UCLAN Northern Schools Floodlit Competition. St Peter's School Boat Club was founded in the 1850s and is one of the oldest school rowing clubs in the world. It has had success at international level with over 28 GB 'vests' earned by Peterites since 1998. On the domestic scene it has won nine medals at The National Schools' Regatta, 12 medals at The National Championships, and 25 appearances at Henley (both Men's and Women's), all since 1991. Music The School Choir averages 170 members a year,St Peter's School York but there is also a more selective Chapel Choir as well as an elite Chamber Choir.

Dronfield (pink) and Rise (white) are girls' boarding houses; Linton (baby blue) and The Manor (gold) are boys' boarding houses. The rest are day houses: Clifton (yellow), The Grove (red), Queens (purple), Temple (green), School (maroon), and Hope (orange). The house system is a long-standing tradition throughout the school's history. As the houses are physical, located in various buildings and parts of buildings throughout the school campus,see the school's website a sense of community is developed, bringing pupils of all ages together to compete in inter-house competitions, like rugby. \\"House Colours\\" are an award that is given in the form of a tie (formerly a badge for female students as they did not wear ties when they were first admitted) to pupils for an outstanding contribution to house activities. In 1982 there were only seven houses: the boarding houses were: School, Rise, Dronfield, and The Manor; the day houses were: Queens, Grove, and Temple. Hope, Clifton, and Linton are of more recent origin. Houses were mixed and female boarders had their own quarters. Boarding St Peter's has received an overall quality rating of 'Outstanding' in their 2007 Ofsted Boarding Inspection. Religion The school has a Chapel with compulsory services 3 mornings a week. Eucharist is also held once a term and there are special services to mark Festivals in the Christian calendar. A service is held on Remembrance Sunday during which all pupils place poppies on the book of remembrance in the Ante-chapel (which contains names of alumni killed in conflict). The school's Christmas Carol Service is held in York Minster. Religious education is compulsory at the school until Sixth Form, and is taught by both academic staff and the school's two Church of England clergy. The school remains predominantly Christian in demographics and in teaching York Minster York Minster has a long connection with St Peter's, as the school's founder was an Archbishop of York. This relationship is also evident in the school's name, which mirrors the formal title of the Minster, The Cathedral and Metropolitical Church of St Peter. At its foundation, the school was probably housed next to the earliest cathedral building. At the end of each academic year a Commemoration and Prizegiving service is held in the Minster and a Carol Service is also held there at Christmas. The school choir often sings in the Minster and in the 2006/2007 year they participated in Verdi's Requiem, which brought together the wider York community. Traditions *Morning Prayers ‚Äì all members of the school attend a chapel service, *Eucharist ‚Äì a whole school Eucharist service takes place each term and at other significant Christian festivals. *Uniform ‚Äì the school has a brown uniform featuring the \\"cross keys\\" of St Peter for all pupils (except members of the Sixth Form). The old woollen blazer was later replaced with a more modern cotton jacket. Other changes to the uniform have also taken place, including the removal of ties for female pupils, who now wear an open blouse. In Sixth Form, dark suits must be worn. *Gowns ‚Äì the school has a tradition of gowns which reflect pupils' authority or commitments. These are worn during public events such as services at York Minster and during school events (including Chapel and Assembly). The Head Boy and Head Girl wear brown, followed by the Head Master's Prefects who wear navy. These are issued during the 'gowning' at First Assembly each academic year. Members of the Chapel Committee and choirs wear red gowns, which are fuller depending upon level (Chamber Choir; Chapel Choir; School Choir). School masters also wear collegiate gowns for services and public events. *Capping ‚Äì is the practice of reward for exceptional sporting achievement and is awarded at the end of the relevant sports season. *5 November ‚Äì on Guy Fawkes Night, the school does not partake in the common tradition of burning a 'Guy' on the bonfire, as Guy Fawkes was an Old Peterite (alumnus).Bonfire Night at St Peter's There is, however, a long tradition of putting on a firework display for the Boarders. *Fagging ‚Äì the tradition of younger pupils serving older pupils was abolished in 1977.

Inspired by the audience response to Dream Theater's heavier songs while on tour,As discussed by John Petrucci in the 20th Anniversary Documentary The Score So Far, found on the Score DVD in the Chaos in Progress documentary, Portnoy says that they wanted Train of Thought to be a \\"balls to the wall\\" album with heavier, darker riffing, exposing them to a number of new metal fans. The album was written in three weeks. It was engineered by Doug Oberkircher and mixed by Kevin Shirley. Most of the album was played in concert for the Live at Budokan DVD. All songs from it have been played live to date. Writing As mentioned in videos of the recording/writing sessions, which were filmed by Mike Portnoy, the band \\"cooped themselves in a rehearsal studio\\" in New York, and wrote the full album from March 10 through April 3, in a record time of three weeks, after which they began recording, starting with the drum tracks and ending with the vocals. Songs * The album opens with the same chord that closed the previous album, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. Similarly, the faint piano note that ends the album is heard at the beginning of the band's next album, Octavarium. * Some lyrics of \\"As I Am\\" were inspired by Dream Theater's 2003 summer tour with Queensr√øche, described by Mike Portnoy as an \\"irksome series of shows.\\" According to Portnoy, Queensr√øche guitarist Mike Stone tried giving John Petrucci tips on playing guitar, leading Petrucci to write the lyrics: \\"Don't tell me what's in, tell me how to write\\". * \\"This Dying Soul\\" continues Mike Portnoy's Twelve-step Suite, which started with \\"The Glass Prison\\" on Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence and later continued with \\"The Root of All Evil\\" on Octavarium, \\"Repentance\\" on Systematic Chaos, and concluded with \\"The Shattered Fortress\\" on Black Clouds & Silver Linings. These songs share some of the lyrics and melodies. For example, this song features a riff from \\"The Glass Prison\\", which is heard at the start of this song's step \\"Release\\". * \\"Honor Thy Father\\" was written about Mike Portnoy's stepfather. When asked about what inspired him to write that song, he stated in an IRC: \\"I'm not very good at writing love songs, so I decided to write a hate song!\\" * Some of the samples in the instrumental break \\"Honor Thy Father\\" are taken from Paul Thomas Anderson's film Magnolia, in the scene when Jason Robards' character is talking to Philip Seymour Hoffman's character about his regrets in life. There are also parts taken from the film At Close Range in which a scene of Sean Penn and Christopher Walken's characters can be heard arguing. Other voice samples heard during the bridge were taken from the movies Ordinary People and The Royal Tenenbaums as well as the TV series Oz. * The lyrics to \\"Vacant\\" were inspired by James LaBrie's daughter, who fell into a short coma after suffering a sudden, unexplained seizure three days before her seventh birthday. * \\"Stream of Consciousness\\" is the longest instrumental on a Dream Theater studio album to date and was the intended title for Falling Into Infinity. * Between 5:51 and 6:07 of the song \\"In the Name of God\\", there was a hidden composition buried beneath the far louder sounds of the song itself which lay undiscovered for over a year and a half. The band did not tell anyone that a hidden \\"nugget\\" (as it became known amongst Dream Theater fans) was present in the song, and only when Mike Portnoy mentioned it in his Mike Portnoy: Live at Budokan Drum-Cam DVD over a year later did someone find it. The Mike Portnoy message board was rife with fans scouring the song looking for what it might be, until a fan going by the pseudonymous name \\"DarrylRevok\\" mentioned that from 5:51 to 6:07 there appeared to be morse code audible, which Nick Bogovich (user handle \\"Bogie\\") isolated and discovered that when translated to English, the phrase \\"eat my ass and balls\\" (a Mike Portnoy catchphrase) was the result. * From 12:56 onwards of \\"In the Name of God\\", the American Civil War hymn \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\\" can be heard in the right channel. * Jordan Rudess played the final note in the album (heard at 14:06 of \\"In the Name of God\\") with his nose as shown in the \\"Making Train of Thought\\" documentary. Mike Portnoy approved the take while he was filming.

Freston (born November 22, 1945) is an American entertainment industry executive. Early life and education Freston grew up in Rowayton, Connecticut. He received a Bachelor of Arts from Saint Michael's College and an MBA from New York University. Freston began his career advertising at Benton & Bowles, which later merged with D'Arcy. In 1972, after a year of traveling, he moved to South Asia to start a textile and clothing business, Hindu Kush, and worked and lived in New Delhi, India and Kabul, Afghanistan. Career Returning to the United States in 1979, he joined the Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment Company (WASEC), a pioneer in the new field of cable television programming. He was one of the founding members of the team that created a music video channel MTV in 1981. As head of marketing, he worked on the \\"I Want My MTV\\" ad campaign that helped make the new network a cultural phenomenon. In 1987, he became the President and CEO of MTV Networks, a job he held for 17 years. MTV Networks launched and operated networks including: Nickelodeon, VH1, Comedy Central, TV Land, Spike, CMT, Logo TV, Noggin, and others. As CEO of MTV Networks, Freston expanded the company's reach, built an animation studio, produced feature films, and developed large consumer product and digital businesses. Popular brands and shows included: Blue's Clues, Beavis and Butthead, SpongeBob SquarePants, Daria, The Daily Show, Jackass, South Park, Drawn Together, Crank Yankers, The Fairly OddParents, Aeon Flux, Chappelle's Show, I Love the..., Behind the Music, Avatar: The Last Airbender, The Colbert Report, Wonder Showzen, The Ren & Stimpy Show, The Real World, Dora the Explorer, Rugrats, and Star Trek series (from Generation to Deep Space Nine). Viacom In 2004, after Viacom President & COO Mel Karmazin stepped down, Freston was named Co-President & Co-COO of Viacom (along with Leslie Moonves). Freston oversaw MTV Networks, Paramount Pictures, Famous Music Publishing, and Simon & Schuster. In January 2006, Viacom split into two separate companies: Viacom led by Freston and CBS Corporation headed by Moonves. In September 2006, Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone stunned the entertainment industry when he fired Freston from the position of CEO. One of the chief reasons for the move was that Freston hadn‚Äôt moved decisively enough to buy MySpace, which was then the most popular social networking site; instead Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation purchased the site for $580 million. Redstone believed that the failure to acquire MySpace contributed to the 20% drop in Viacom‚Äôs stock price in 2006 up to the date of Freston‚Äôs ouster. Freston's successor as CEO, Philippe Dauman, was quoted as saying ‚Äúnever, ever let another competitor beat us to the trophy‚Äù. Redstone told interviewer Charlie Rose that losing MySpace had been ‚Äúhumiliating,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúMySpace was sitting there for the taking for $500 million.‚Äù Murdoch's company ended up selling Myspace, which had largely declined along with the rise of rival social networking website Facebook, in 2012; News Corp's sale price at the time was $35 million. Post-Viacom Freston is currently the principal of Firefly3 LLC, a consulting and investment company. In January 2015, he became a senior advisor to The Raine Group, a boutique merchant bank.

Born in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe) to an Afrikaner mother and a Lithuanian Jewish father, he moved to Northern Rhodesia, became involved with the trade unions, and entered the colonial legislative council in 1938. There, he campaigned for the amalgamation of Northern and Southern Rhodesia (the latter under White self-government, the former under the colonial office). Although unsuccessful, he succeeded in the formation of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, a state within the British Empire that sought to retain predominant power for the White minority while moving in a progressive political direction, in contrast to South Africa under the apartheid system. Becoming Prime Minister of the Federation in 1957, Welensky opposed British moves towards black majority rule, and used force to suppress politically motivated violence in the territories. After the advent of Black majority rule in two of the Federation's three territories (Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, now Zambia and Malawi respectively), it collapsed in 1963. Welensky retired to Salisbury, where he re-entered politics and attempted to stop Rhodesia (formerly Southern Rhodesia) from unilaterally declaring itself independent. With the end of White minority rule in 1979, and the recognised independence of Rhodesia as the \\"Republic of Zimbabwe\\" under Robert Mugabe in 1980, Welensky emigrated to the United Kingdom, where he died in England in 1991. A fervent admirer of Britain and its Empire, Welensky described himself as \\"half Jewish, half Afrikaner [and] 100% British\\".\\"The crown, empire loyalism and the assimilation of non-British white subjects in the British world: An argument against ethnic determinism\\", Donal Lowry, May 2003, Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History, pp. 31‚Äì32. Youth Welensky was born in Pioneer Street, Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia. His father, Michael Welensky (b. c. 1843), was of Lithuanian Jewish origin, hailing from a village near Wilno (today Vilnius); a trader in Russia and horse-smuggler during the Franco- Prussian War, he settled in Southern Rhodesia after first emigrating to the United States, where he was a saloon-keeper, and then South Africa.Lowry, Donal, \\"Welensky, Sir Roland (1907‚Äì1991)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, May 2006. Retrieved 2 March 2016 (subscription or UK public library membership required). His mother, Leah (born Aletta Ferreira; c. 1865‚Äì1918), was a ninth-generation Afrikaner of Dutch ancestry.\\"Sir Roy Welensky\\", Encyclopedia of World Biography, 2nd ed. 17 Vols. Gale Research, 1998. His parents, for whom Raphael or \\"Roy\\" was the thirteenth child, kept a \\"poor White\\" boarding house.Cross, Colin The Fall of the British Empire London Book Club Associates 1968 p.95 Welensky's mother died when he was eleven years old, being treated by Godfrey Huggins, a doctor who went on to become the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia.Connell, John, Welensky (1964), pp. 13‚Äì15 Although not of British ancestry, Welensky was intensely pro-British, a distinctive sentiment among Rhodesians. John Connell, in his foreword to Welensky's book 4000 Days, wrote: \\"Welensky, who had not a drop of British blood in his veins, shared this pride and loyalty [towards Britain] to the full.\\" After leaving school at the age of fourteen, Welensky found employment with Rhodesia Railways as a fireman, while putting his physical strength to work as a boxer. He rose through the ranks of Rhodesia Railways to become a locomotive engine driverNyarota, Geoff. Serious politics, educated elite and related matters, Zimbabwe Situation. Accessed 7 March 2007. and became involved in the trade union movement, joining the Rhodesian Railway Workers' Union. After participating in the unsuccessful 1929 Rhodesian Railways strike, Welensky was moved by management to Broken Hill, the main base of the railways in Northern Rhodesia. In 1933, he became Chairman of the Broken Hill branch of the union, and was appointed to the National Council. While working on the railways, he became the professional heavyweight boxing champion of Southern Rhodesia at nineteen years old and held the position until he was 21. During this time, Welensky met his first wife, Elizabeth Henderson, who was working at a cafe in Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia at the time. They married after a two-year courtship.Royboy (27 April 1962), Time Magazine. Accessed 21 May 2007. Colonial politics Welensky was elected to the Northern Rhodesian Legislative Council in the 1938 general elections. The Governor of Northern Rhodesia prevented Welensky from enlisting in the armed forces in World War II and appointed him Director of Manpower. In 1941 he formed his own party, the Northern Rhodesian Labour Party, with the aim of amalgamating the colony with Southern Rhodesia under a new constitution.Welensky (1964), p. 15 The party won all five seats it contested in the 1941 elections. After the leader of the unofficial members in the Legislative Council, Stewart Gore-Browne, resigned in 1945 and stated that black Africans had lost confidence in the whites (due to the wish for amalgamation), Welensky was elected leader.Welensky (1964), pp. 16‚Äì17 Although a member of the Legislative Council, this was not a full-time job, and he continued working as a train driver for Rhodesia Railways, and also as a Trade Union leader. Amalgamation and federation From the beginning, Welensky was involved in the creation of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. He had earlier wanted an amalgamation of Northern and Southern Rhodesia with a constitution similar to that of Southern Rhodesia (that had effectively granted responsible government to the white Rhodesians by specifying franchise qualifications that few blacks had so far achieved - though they were not prevented from acquiring them). After the British Government rejected this idea, he set about the creation of a federation, and against his judgement, the small colony of Nyasaland was included. His main wish for amalgamation, and later federation, was primarily so the complementary economic strengths of the Rhodesias could be put to best use. He felt that the colonies were missing out on the post-war economic boom.Welensky (1964), p. 21 The Victoria Falls. Talks between the territorial governments to explore the idea of federation were held at the nearby Victoria Falls Hotel in 1963. To this end, Welensky organised a conference in February 1949 to investigate the idea of a federation. Held at the Victoria Falls Hotel (a common venue for Rhodesian political conferences), representatives from the Northern and Southern Rhodesian Governments were present, but native Africans and the British Government were not. It was agreed that continued pushes for amalgamation would fail, with both the British and native Africans opposed. Welensky suggested that the Constitution of Australia be used as a basis for the proposed federal constitution, and pushed the idea of 'partnership' between blacks and whites.Welensky (1964), p. 29 However, he insisted that \\"for as long as I can see, in that partnership [the whites] will be senior partners\\".Blake (1977), p. 248 Apart from organising the federation, Welensky won a significant political battle in Northern Rhodesia against the British South Africa Company (BSAC), which controlled mineral rights and the associated royalties throughout the territory. The company, and not the British Crown, had signed the treaties with African kings that surrendered mining rights, but the BSAC had stopped administering Northern Rhodesia in 1924. Welensky argued that the territory had a right to the royalties, and petitioned the Governor to take action. After many talks, the BSAC relented and agreed to surrender mineral rights in 1986, and to pay 20% of its profits from these rights to the government until then.Welensky (1964), pp. 32‚Äì33 In March 1952, the colonial and the British governments met in London to discuss federation. There, the idea for a federation was finalised and settled, although the colonial governments had, again, insisted on amalgamation. They were rebuffed by the left-leaning public servant (later Sir) Andrew Cohen, who, after much deliberation, brought the parties to an agreement. It was acknowledged by those at the meeting that all too often the racial policies of the Rhodesias were confused with the emerging apartheid of South Africa, and Welensky himself claimed to refute these ideas when being interviewed by a South African newspaper. He was paternalistic towards native Africans, but believed in the dictum of \\"equal rights for all civilised men\\" and gradual advancement.Welensky (1964), p. 38 Behind the scenes, Welensky and the Rhodesians had been courting the Conservatives, while the native Africans had been doing the same with Labour. A British general election was held in 1951 and the Conservatives gained power.Blake (1977), p. 259 Labour, mindful of the overwhelming opposition of Africans from both Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland and of the Colonial Office mandate to oversee native interests, had been lukewarm at best to the idea of federation, and had been wholly opposed to amalgamation. After the election, the bipartisan approach to federation broke down and the British laws for its creation passed only with the support of the Conservatives, with both Liberal and Labour Parties now opposed.Blake (1977), p. 261 Federation established Welensky stood for the federal legislature in 1953 for the United Federal Party (UFP), created by himself and Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister Sir Godfrey Huggins. The party was successful in its first election, with twice the votes of the opposition Confederate Party. Welensky himself gained more than 80% of the vote in the federal constituency of Broken Hill and was immediately promoted to Minister for Transport.Blake (1977), pp. 285‚Äì286 The Flag of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. On the shield, the rising sun represents Nyasaland, the lion Southern Rhodesia, and the black and white wavy lines Northern Rhodesia. The first few years of the federation were characterised by a relatively peaceful political atmosphere and a booming economy. The government's coffers were kept full through revenue from Northern Rhodesia's copper mines, and overseas investment saw the rapid expansion of the cities of Salisbury, Bulawayo and Lusaka. High- standard tar roads replaced dirt tracks and the railway system was expanded.Blake (1977), p. 289 Welensky credited the high rate of development to the astute management of the federal Minister of Finance, Donald Macintyre.Welensky (1964), p. 67 The Southern Rhodesian Government, under the leadership of Garfield Todd, began removing restrictions imposed on native Africans. The civil service opened more positions to blacks, the title for male Africans was changed from 'AM' (African male) to Mr., and diners and restaurants were allowed to be multiracial; Welensky, as Transport Minister, allowed for railway dining cars to be multiracial. However, when it came to liberalising alcohol restrictions on blacks, Welensky argued against doing so, stating that such an action would cause the UFP to lose the next election.Blake (1977), p. 290 After repeated failed attempts to secure Dominion status for the federation, the Prime Minister Godfrey Huggins opted not to stand again for his party's leadership at their September 1956 conference. In October he resigned and Welensky, the second most senior figure in the federal arena, was chosen to replace him. Welensky took office on 1 November.Blake (1977), pp. 294‚Äì295 Prime Minister On taking office, Welensky was forced to take sides in the Suez Crisis. The government of the United Kingdom received heavy international criticism for its actions, but Welensky's government, with those of Australia and New Zealand, nonetheless stood behind Britain. It was Welensky's first experience in international politics.Welensky (1964), p. 67‚Äì68 In the aftermath of the Suez debacle British colonial policy changed significantly, which would have adverse effects for the Federation. It marked the decline of a gradual approach to decolonisation, and a rapid speeding up of the process. Politically, only three years after its founding, the federation began to decline.Blake (1977), pp. 321‚Äì322 International attitudes to the Federation were critical, particularly from the Afro-Asian bloc in the United Nations. At a time when most colonial powers were rushing their colonies towards independence, the Federation seemed to its opponents to be an unwelcome obstacle. In Britain, Labour grew more critical, and African nationalists in the federation itself became more vocal, dissatisfied with the liberalisation that was taking place, and demanding faster moves towards African advancement. The Governor of Northern Rhodesia, Sir Arthur Benson, wrote a secret letter to his superiors in Britain, highly critical of Welensky and the federation; this letter remained undiscovered until 1958, when Huggins revealed it to Welensky.Welensky (1964), pp. 69‚Äì70 Nyasaland unrest alt=A map. See description The Colonial Secretary Alan Lennox-Boyd visited the Federation in January 1957, while Welensky prepared to outline the difficulties regarding African advancement. Seeking to bring Africans into the established political processes, and hoping they would shun the recently formed African National Congress (ANC) parties, Welensky hit out at what he saw as the poor Colonial Office practice of making the situation \\"[consist] of two opposed policies, black rule and white rule. They naturally prefer to aim for black rule and hope they will experience this, which they regard as the apotheosis of Colonial Office policy\\".Welensky (1964), p. 73 The Nyasaland African Congress (NAC) was particularly vocal about increased African representation in the Nyasaland Legislative Council, demanding in September 1957 an African majority in the council. Nyasaland's inclusion in the Federation was never a goal of its proponents, it was there primarily because it was not economically viable by itself. Welensky did not understand or appreciate the party's goal of increased African representation or secession when it relied on the Federation for its well being.Welensky (1964), pp. 96‚Äì97 Hastings Banda, the leader of the Nyasaland nationalist cause, returned to the territory in 1958 and began organising opposition to the Federation. Having lived outside the territory for more than 25 years and having great difficulty remembering his native African language, he required the assistance of interpreters to communicate with the population, whom he stirred into a frenzy with his speeches. After the Governor and the Federal Government refused to give Africans a majority in the Legislative Council, he embarked on a speaking tour of the territory. In January 1959, he stated in a speech that he \\"put Salisbury [the capital] on fire ... I got Salisbury rocking, rocking, and got it awake out of its political sleep ...\\",Welensky (1964), p. 114 after which his followers stoned passing cars and police officers. The federal government met with the territorial governments to plan for a response should the violence get out of hand. Welensky did not rule out deploying federal troops if the situation deteriorated.Welensky (1964), p. 100 Speaking to the defence chiefs in Salisbury, he said that \\"during the next three months we can expect some fairly serious trouble in Nyasaland ... It is my concern to ensure that this government is in a position to exercise its responsibilities if trouble comes\\".Welensky (1964), p. 115 A NAC meeting was held outside Blantyre on 25 January. It was alleged that the meeting discussed in detail a plan for the overthrow of the territorial government and the massacre of the territory's whites and any blacks who collaborated with them.Welensky (1964), pp. 118‚Äì19 (although a subsequent Royal Commission found there was insufficient evidence to make such a claim). Welensky obtained the meeting's proceedings in early February and decided to act, calling a meeting of the federal and territorial governments. Federal troops were deployed to Nyasaland on 21 February, the Governor of Nyasaland proclaimed a state of emergency on 3 March and the nationalist leaders were arrested and flown to jails in Southern Rhodesia. In the subsequent fortnight, riots broke out and troops used force to end the violence. Almost 50 people died in the unrest.Blake (1977), pp. 324‚Äì325 The main militant African nationalist parties in each territory were banned by the federal and territorial governments, but all reorganised under new names only months later. The Southern Rhodesian ANC became the National Democratic Party (later ZAPU),Blake (1977), p. 341 the Northern Rhodesian ANC became the Zambian African National Congress,Blake (1977) p. 324 and the Nyasaland ANC became the Malawi Congress Party.Wood (2004), p. 17Wood (2004), p. 24 The media's use of the term 'police state' to describe the response to the violence outraged the Liberals, the Church of Scotland, and leftist Conservatives, and particularly the Labour Party, in Britain. John Stonehouse, a Labour MP, had been deported prior to the declaration of the state of emergency, adding to the tension. A Royal Commission was announced to investigate the violence. Welensky was indignant when asked to contribute to the Royal Commission, and the Labour Party boycotted it.Blake (1977), p. 326 Commissions and Macmillan In addition to the Royal Commission that investigated the Nyasaland violence (now known as the Devlin Report), the British Government organised a second one, known as the Monckton Report, to advise on the future of the federation. Released in October 1960, the report advocated sweeping changes to be made to the federal structure, including African majorities in the Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesian legislatures. Welensky was outraged when the report was published, calling it the \\"death knell of federation\\" and rejecting it out of hand.Collapsing Bastion (24 October 1960), Time Magazine; accessed 21 May 2007. African nationalist opinion was just as opposed, but on different grounds. All nationalists wanted an end to federation, and independence for the territories as black-majority- ruled states. Welensky was opposed to any talk of secession, and the Monckton Report suggested it in writing when it stated that the territories should have the option after five years under a new federal constitution.Blake (1977), p. 331 Early 1960 saw British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan journey to the Federation for the first and last time. There he held talks in person with Welensky and the territorial governments, and took the opportunity to gauge African opinion towards the Federation. He also wished to talk to the jailed African leaders, but was met with a rebuff from Welensky. Hastings Banda discussed the probability of his release from prison with the British Government through Labour MP Dingle Foot. Welensky had Banda's cell wired for sound and was frustrated with what he saw as the British government's \\"betrayal, duplicity, appeasement, cowardice and loss of nerve\\"Blake (1977), pp. 327‚Äì28 when dealing with the African nationalists and the federation. Macmillan travelled on to South Africa, where he made his 'Wind of Change' speech to the South African Parliament, raising the attention of South African Prime Minister, Dr Hendrik Verwoerd. Welensky was informed that Banda would be released so he could join in discussions with the British Government over the future of the Federation.Welensky (1964), p. 179‚Äì80 Losing patience with the British, Welensky took a harder line against them: \\"I've tried all along to behave in a reasonable and responsible manner. Now I'm seriously wondering whether restraint has been the right policy.\\"Welensky (1964), p. 181 New constitutions After Banda was released from prison against the wishes of Welensky, Banda travelled to the United Kingdom, where he took part in the Nyasaland constitutional talks. The outcome was a constitution which, through a voting system that was as complex as that of the Federation itself, amounted to black majority rule for the territory. Bitter and angry at what he saw as British ignorance to the situation, Welensky did not comprehend how the British were willing to deal with Banda. In Welensky's words, since his release from prison, \\"[Banda] was careful to appeal for calm and to condemn violence\\",Welensky (1964), p. 190‚Äì91 but Welensky was averse to Banda's demands for black majority rule and believed that granting it to the territory would mean the end of the Federation.Welensky (1964), pp. 291‚Äì292 In Northern and Southern Rhodesia new constitutions were also enacted. The Southern Rhodesian constitution was very cautious and prolonged white rule. It had 50 A-roll seats with high voting qualifications (essentially for whites), and 15 B-roll seats with lower qualifications (for blacks). A system of 'cross voting' meant that results in A-roll seats would be affected by the B-roll vote, and vice versa. All constitutions were signed by the UFP and the African nationalist party in each territory. However, there were immediate repercussions; Ian Smith, chief whip for the UFP in the federal assembly, resigned in protest at the new Southern Rhodesian constitution, calling it \\"racialist\\", while the nationalist National Democratic Party withdrew support for the constitution having earlier signed it.Blake (1977), p. 335 Eventually, Welensky was comfortable with an African majority in Nyasaland and for the province to secede, seeking to preserve only a union of the two Rhodesias. But, as a Northern Rhodesian, he did not accept black majority rule for the territory and a battle was had with the British Government over its new constitution throughout 1961‚Äì62. Discussing Northern Rhodesia under African rule with Smith: \\"I am not prepared to hand power to the blacks. Personally I could not live in a country where they were in control.\\"Smith (2001), p. 42 Welensky considered a federal unilateral declaration of independence when the new Northern Rhodesian constitution appeared likely to grant an African majority in its parliament. Determined at one point to prevent changes, Welensky was convinced that if he refused, the British would use military force to remove his government. Believing that preparations were being made for an invasion from Kenya, he discussed the federation's ability to repel an attack with his defence chiefs and plans were set in motion.Welensky (1964), p. 297 In the end, the idea of a British invasion was one of many options considered, and did not make it past cabinet discussion. Congo, Katanga and Tshombe Welensky once told a journalist that he was considering incorporating the Belgian Congo's Katanga Province into the Federation. After the Belgian Congo gained independence in 1960 as the Republic of the Congo, it collapsed into a state of anarchy within a fortnight. The large Belgian population of the Congo fled from the violence into neighbouring states, including the Federation. Welensky dispatched the Royal Rhodesian Air Force (RRAF) to assist in their evacuation, but was prevented by the British government from entering the Congo itself. Refugees fled by foot to Ndola in Northern Rhodesia, where RRAF planes picked them up and flew them to camps in Salisbury. More than 6,000 people were evacuated by the RRAF.Welensky (1964), pp. 209‚Äì10 The leader of Katanga, Moise Tshombe, requested British and Rhodesian forces to enter the country to restore order. Welensky was sympathetic to the situation but unable to act; the British government, which had ultimate jurisdiction over the Federation, disallowed him from mobilising the armed forces. Tshombe declared Katanga unilaterally independent on 11 July 1960, one day after requesting British and Rhodesian assistance.Welensky (1964), p. 211 Welensky pleaded with Macmillan to deploy the Rhodesian forces but Macmillan rebuffed him, telling Welensky their hopes were pinned on the United Nations being able to restore order, and hoping for a wholly neutral or anti-communist Congo. Welensky decided to support Tshombe, feeling that Katanga could provide a buffer between the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba of the Congolese government. Welensky feared Lumumba was supporting black nationalists and communists in the federation. He argued that \\"the security of Southern Africa from Communism requires that Katanga be recognised de facto by as many countries as possible. Such recognition would strengthen Tshombe's hand enormously.\\" The Federation provided a key outlet for Tshombe to acquire mercenaries, smuggled weapons, and sell Katanga's minerals for cash. When the United Nations requested permission to post observers at the Katangese‚ÄìRhodesian border to halt the smuggling, Welensky refused to assent. Welensky heavily criticised UN peacekeeping operations in the Congo and the United Kingdom's response to the crisis. He used this as a means to mobilize white Rhodesian support for his government as it came under increasing pressure from the white supremacist Rhodesian Front (RF) party for failing to contain black nationalism within the federation. Welensky stayed in regular communication with Tshombe, though they did not not meet in person until late September 1961. In September United Nations troops launched Operation Morthor, bringing them into conflict with Katangese forces. Though Welensky had abided by previous instructions from Macmillan to refrain from troop deployments, the British High Commissioner gave him permission this time, and Welensky moved ground troops and most of the RRAF to the frontier. United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskj√∂ld, hoping to negotiate a solution to Katanga's secession, agreed to meet Tshombe at Ndola. However, Hammarskj√∂ld's plane was shot down from Rhodesian territory close to Ndola in November 1961, and he was killed. Welensky was subsequently blamed for the accident throughout the communist and Afro-Asian world, becoming a hated figure and a lingering symbol of colonialism. Other UN officials reached a ceasefire agreement with Tshombe in Ndola, and Macmillan thanked Welensky for facilitating the meeting. The British government ultimately decided to support the concept of a unified Congo and rallied against Katanga's secession. Welensky thought the decision was cynical and displayed weakness in the British Empire. Welensky's attitude towards Katanga and the Congo would strain relations between the federation and the British until its dissolution.Blake (1977), p. 330. Territorial and federal elections With new constitutions in place for the territories, elections were held throughout 1961‚Äì62, with Welensky's UFP being beaten in each one. In Nyasaland, the African nationalist Malawi Congress Party won a huge majority and Banda set about lobbying the British Government for the break-up of the federation and the independence of Nyasaland as Malawi. In Northern Rhodesia, neither the UFP nor the two African nationalist parties held a majority, but the African nationalists united to push for independence.Blake (1977), p. 337 Welensky hoped to get a display of confidence in federation, so he dissolved parliament in mid-1962 and held elections. While his party won a huge victory, it did so because it was completely unopposed. Neither the recently formed RF nor the African nationalist parties bothered to contest it.Blake (1977), p. 345 In Southern Rhodesia, the UFP lost the hold that it and its successor parties had for decades in the October election. Ian Smith, a former federal member of the UFP, had united with Winston Field of the Dominion Party to form the Rhodesian Front, a conservative party that was opposed to a fast rate of African political advancement and the 1961 constitution, and in support of Southern Rhodesian independence. The RF won 55% of the vote and 35 A-roll seats, while the UFP won 44% of the vote, 15 A-roll seats and 14 B-roll seats.Smith (2001), p. 47 Welensky now had parties in power in all three territorial legislatures that were opposed to the federation and advocating independence for their respective territories. Dissolution With Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia now promised independence by Britain under 'one man, one vote' constitutions, the Federation was essentially dead. Southern Rhodesia, still governed by its white minority, was subject to attacks in the United Nations general assembly which regarded its constitution as unsatisfactory. It demanded 'one man, one vote' elections, stating that this was the only \\"realistic answer to the powerful and irresistible urge of the indigenous people for freedom and equality\\".Welensky (1964), p. 341 Accepting the end of the Federation, Welensky set about ensuring that the assets of the federal government were transferred to Southern Rhodesia, making this a condition of him attending dissolution talks at Victoria Falls.Blake (1977), p. 351 Welensky refused to dine with the British delegates, on the grounds of \\"not choking on his food\\", but ensured that the talks went smoothly. The federation was legally dissolved on 31 December 1963. Rhodesian UDI With the collapse of the federation, Welensky moved to Salisbury, Rhodesia (renamed from Southern Rhodesia after Northern Rhodesia gained independence as Zambia). After a short break, he was invited to lead the UFP in Rhodesia, which had recently renamed itself the Rhodesia Party. With the Rhodesian Front pushing for independence for the territory and a new constitution, the Rhodesia Party advocated the same, but with a focus on stemming white emigration and rebuilding the economy (all three territories had slipped into recession with the end of the federation).Wood (2004), p. 226 With the resignation of the RF member for the Salisbury constituency of Arundel, Welensky was given a chance to re-enter the political arena. Clifford Dupont, Deputy Prime Minister, resigned his constituency in Charter to oppose Welensky. Welensky knew if the RF won the byelections it would appear as a mandate for unilateral independence; the campaign, for only two seats, was intense. At public meetings, Welensky was heckled by opponents to ironic cries of 'Communist', 'traitor', and 'coward'.Blake (1977), p. 366 Sharing a television platform with Smith on 3 September, Welensky talked of the economic and political dangers of a UDI, but nonetheless wished Smith luck when he departed for independence talks in London.Wood (2004), p. 230 Welensky had much more antipathy for the British Government than his RF opponents, and was disgusted at their treatment of the Rhodesians during constitutional talks: On 1 October Welensky was soundly defeated by his RF opponent, with 633 votes to Dupont's 1079.Wood (2004), p. 239 In December he resigned the leadership of his party. When the RF declared unilateral independence on 11 November 1965,Blake (1977), p. 381 Welensky was upset at the constitutional break with Britain.Blake (1977), p. 388 He believed that Rhodesia was entitled to her independence, and disagreed with the British government's demand for 'no independence before majority rule', but was opposed to illegal action.Wood (2004), p. 249 Retirement Welensky continued living in Rhodesia until Robert Mugabe gained power and the country became Zimbabwe in 1980. While in London in 1971, and by then a widower, Welensky had met Miriam Valerie Scott (b. Dewsbury, Q3, 1940)), an organiser for the Cities of London and Westminster Conservative Association, who was some thirty three years his junior. The couple were married, and had two daughters, Aletta Rosemary (b. Westminster, Q2, 1975) and Alexandra Louise (b. Westminster, Q2, 1978). They relocated in 1981 to Blandford Forum, Dorset, where he died on 5 December 1991.Sir Roy Welensky obituary, The Times, 6 December 1991. His wife Valerie also died in Blandford Forum, in 2005. He is buried in Kinson Cemetery, Bournemouth. Notes References  External links *Speech by Sir Roy Welensky given to the Institute of International Affairs in 1962 *Roy Welensky Papers (MS 1558).

Foster supported the Louisiana Constitution of 1898, which effectively disfranchised the black majority, who were mostly Republicans. This led to Louisiana becoming a one-party Democratic state for several generations and excluding African Americans from the political system. Louisiana followed Mississippi (1890) and other southern states in adopting a new constitution with devices to disfranchise blacks, then a majority in the state, chiefly by making voter registration more difficult. This situation of discriminatory political exclusion was not corrected until after enforcement of constitutional rights by the federal government under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Early and personal life Foster was born in 1849 on his family's sugar cane plantation near Franklin, the seat of St. Mary Parish, to Thomas J. Foster and the former Martha P. Murphy. His father owned fifty slaves in 1860, marking him as a major planter.DAVID FIRESTONE, \\"Identity Restored to 100,000 Louisiana Slaves\\", The New York Times, 30 July 2000 Murphy Foster was educated in public schools and attended Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, and graduated from Cumberland University in Lebanon, Tennessee in 1870. He studied law at the University of Louisiana (later Tulane University) in New Orleans and was admitted to the bar in 1871 during the Reconstruction era (United States). On May 15, 1877, Foster married Florence Daisy Hine, the daughter of Franklin merchant T.D. Hine. She died on August 26, 1877, at age 19. In 1881, he married Rose Routh Ker, daughter of Captain John Ker and the former Rose Routh of Ouida Plantation in West Feliciana Parish near Baton Rouge. The couple had ten children, nine of whom lived to maturity. These included Murphy James Foster II, the father of future Governor Murphy (Mike) Foster. By and large the family has been Episcopalian. Road to governorship State House, 1892 Prior to being elected and serving as governor, Foster served as a state senator from 1880 to 1892. In 1892, he was elected governor as the Democratic Party nominee, and he had the support of the Farmer's Alliance, a populist group, as well. His lieutenant governors were Charles Parlange and Hiram R. Lott, during his first term, and Robert H. Snyder of Tensas Parish in the second term. Foster appointed Thomas M. Wade of Newellton, another Tensas Parish legislator, to the state board of education. Wade later served as the long-term Tensas Parish school superintendent. Foster appointed Adolphe Lafargue, a newspaper publisher and a state representative from Avoyelles Parish to a state court judgeship, which Lafargue retained until shortly before his death in 1917. He named as his private secretary William Washington Vance, a state senator from Bossier Parish and a native of South Carolina. He appointed Swords Lee, a Mississippi native descended from the Lee family of Virginia and a timber businessman from Pollock as the assessor for Grant Parish. Foster appointed William B. Bailey, the co-founder of the Lafayette Daily Advertiser and the former mayor of Lafayette as the clerk of the state district court for Lafayette Parish. John N. Pharr In the 1896 general election, Foster was re-elected as the incumbent. He defeated the Republican-Populist fusion candidate John Newton Pharr (1829‚Äì1903), a sugar planter from St. Mary Parish. Lewis Strong Clarke, a neighboring sugar planter from St. Mary Parish, directed the Pharr campaign. Pharr had possibly gained a majority of votes cast and won twenty-six of the then fifty-nine parishes, with his greatest strength in north central Louisiana and the Florida Parishes to the east of Baton Rouge.William C. Havard, Rudolf Heberle, and Perry H. Howard, The Louisiana Elections of 1960, Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Studies, 1963, p. 24 With the assistance of the Regular Democratic Organization political machine based in New Orleans,Governor Murphy James Foster in Encyclopedia Louisiana (retrieved 2009-12-28). Foster officially received 116,116 votes (57 percent) to Pharr's 87,698 ballots (43 percent). The election, however, suffered heavily from fraud which benefited Foster, and widespread violence to suppress black Republican voting. A clear accounting of the election results is probably not possible.Henry E. Chambers, History of Louisiana, Vol. 2 (Chicago: American Historical Society, 1925), pp. 15-16. See the excerpt on John N. Pharr's son, Henry Newton Pharr, at http://files.usgwarchives.org/la/iberia/bios/pharrhn.txt . See also Pharr, Texas, namesake of Henry N. Pharr. Subsequently, as governor, Foster signed off on the new Louisiana Constitution of 1898, establishing a variety of voter registration requirements that would \\"disenfranchise blacks, Republicans, and white Populists.\\"Biosketch of William Wright Heard , Louisiana Secretary of State site (accessed 2009 December 28). Heard was easily elected as the Democratic nominee for governor in 1900, as the Democratic nomination had become tantamount to election. (All of these categories of voters had voted overwhelmingly for John N. Pharr, and similar coalitions gained governorships and/or congressional seats in some southern states. The new constitution ensured that Louisiana would become a one-party state, and it was part of the \\"Solid South\\" Democratic hegemony for the next six decades.) After Foster's reelection in 1896, Louisiana general elections were non-competitive; the only competition took place in Democratic primaries. Voter rolls were sharply reduced by the new initiatives, and blacks and other groups were excluded from the political system. The white-controlled legislature imposed racial segregation and Jim Crow.See also the note to Murphy J. Foster. As an example of the changed politics, by 1908 when John N. Pharr's son Henry Newton Pharr (eponym of Pharr, Texas) sought the Louisiana governorship as a Republican, he gained just 11.1 percent, of a much reduced proportion of voters in comparison to his father's campaign against Foster in 1896.See Jared Y. Sanders, Sr.#Legislature to governorship. For a summary of the Pharr family papers, see http://www.lib.lsu.edu/special/guides/sugresources.html .

Pharr III. Senator and customs official After leaving the office of governor in 1900, Foster was elected by the state legislature as a U.S. senator. He served until 1913, when he lost the Democratic nomination. Thereafter, he was appointed as the customs collector in New Orleans by President Woodrow Wilson. This Southerner achieved office because he gained an Electoral College bonus following disfranchisement of blacks in the South and hobbling of the Republican Party.Richard M. Valelly, The Two Reconstructions: The Struggle for Black Enfranchisement University of Chicago Press, 2009, pp. 146-147 Death Foster died in 1921 on the Dixie Plantation near Franklin, some nine years before his grandson and namesake, a future governor of the state, was born. Legacy Foster worked to maintain white supremacy in Louisiana through his support of the Louisiana Constitution of 1898, which practically disfranchised blacks. He also led the fight which succeeded in outlawing the Louisiana Lottery Co. Foster fought for the interest of sugar growers and supported flood-control legislation and the regulation of railway rates. Foster was the last governor of Louisiana to serve two consecutive 4-year terms until John J. McKeithen (who served from 1964 to 1972).In the meantime Earl K. Long served part of one term and all of two other terms, but the terms were not consecutive; Jimmie Davis served two nonconsecutive 4-year terms. Because blacks were disfranchised under his administration, Democratic candidates in the state did not encounter serious challenges from Republicans until 1963. At the beginning of a realignment of party identification in the South, that year John J. McKeithen was challenged by Republican Charlton Lyons. Since the late 20th century, the former Confederate states, where whites constitute a majority, have since generally elected Republican national candidates. In 1997, Foster was posthumously inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield. His grandson, Murphy J. Foster Jr., served as a Republican governor of the state from 1996 to 2004. \\"Mike\\" Foster is technically Murphy J. Foster III, but he uses the term \\"Jr.\\" instead.

They had two top-ten albums and seven consecutive top- ten singles, with chart-topping success on the UK Singles Chart as well as across Europe, Asia, Australasia and the US, selling over 12 million records globally. The group had originally been a quartet with Zena McNally who left in 2000. The second line-up released their debut studio album Lickin' on Both Sides on 27 October 2001, which peaked at number three on the UK Albums Chart and was certified double platinum. The album featured the group's first five singles, all of which became UK Top 10 hits, including their debut single \\"Why?\\" with McNally and \\"All I Want\\". On 29 March 2003, following a hiatus, they released their second studio album Eye Candy, also a double platinum success. This album featured their biggest international hit \\"Scandalous\\", which peaked at No.2 on the United States charts. The group announced in February 2005 that they would be splitting to pursue solo careers, owing to the demise of their record label Telstar Records. They released a greatest hits album on 25 April 2005 to coincide with their separation. History 1996‚Äì2001: Formation and line-up changes Alesha Dixon and Sabrina Washington met in 1997 at Dance Attic studios in Fulham through Louise Porter, who was putting together a group for her production company Big Out Ltd. The two worked with Louise Porter for a couple of years before being joined by Tina Barrett to form a trio performing singing and dancing. They were named Face2Face, were unsigned, and all band members still worked day jobs. Barrett left to join S Club 7 after a successful audition for Simon Fuller and was replaced by Zena McNally and Su-Elise Nash. Their then producer David Brant (writer of their first two hit singles, \\"Why?\\" and \\"All I Want\\") introduced them via DJ Darren Stokes (TinTinOut) to Inferno Records (sub pop) A&R; man Pat Travers, who went on to sign them to Telstar Records and changed their name to Mis-Teeq. After months of recording‚Äîincluding sessions with producers Norwegian duo Stargate along with Brant (Vybrant Music), Ed Case, Blacksmith, Rishi Rich, and Ceri Evans‚ÄîMis-Teeq released their debut single in 2000, \\"Why?\\", a Latin-flavoured mid-tempo song co-written and produced by Brant. A garage remix by Matt \\"Jam\\" Lamont soon became a success in the underground UK garage scene, and as a result a second music video for the song was filmed and released. \\"Why\\" became a hit on the UK Singles Chart with a peak position of number eight. McNally decided to leave the line-up in December 2000 saying she felt unhappy about \\"an unbalance in the group\\". 2001‚Äì2002: Lickin' on Both Sides, touring and hiatus The three remaining members went on to release their second single \\"All I Want\\" in June 2001. It was co-written and originally produced by David Brant, and produced and remixed by Ceri Evans (also known as Sunship). The song topped the success of the trio's debut single, becoming a number 2 hit in the UK and simultaneously entering the top 30 of the Australian singles chart. The group finally released their debut album Lickin' on Both Sides on 27 October 2001. It became a platinum success and sold more than 300,000 copies domestically. Nevertheless, Mis-Teeq saw instant international success with their Stargate-produced third single \\"One Night Stand\\". While the song peaked at number 5 on the UK singles chart, it also entered the top 20 in Australia, New Zealand, Norway, and Denmark. In 2002, the band's fourth single, \\"B with Me\\", continued the group's remarkable sales with another top 10 entry in the UK; once again entering at number 5. The last release from Lickin' on Both Sides was a double A-side of \\"Roll on\\" and the Montell Jordan cover \\"This Is How We Do It\\", latter song being featured on the soundtrack for Ali G's 2002 film Ali G Indahouse. This release entered the charts at number 7 on 29 June 2002. The band supported Shaggy on his UK tour in 2002. 2003‚Äì2005: Eye Candy, international breakthrough and split Returning from a short hiatus, Mis-Teeq released their second album, Eye Candy on 29 March 2003. The album featured production by Stargate, Ed Case, Salaam Remi, singer Joe, Delroy \\"D-Roy\\" Andrews and Jermaine Dupri and debuted at its peak position of number 6 on the UK Albums Chart, eventually receiving a gold certification. While Eye Candy's sales failed to link on the sudden success of Lickin' on Both Sides, pre-released lead single \\"Scandalous\\" became the group's most successful single by then: It reached number 2 in the UK and top 10 in Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, and Denmark. In June 2003, the album's second single \\"Can't Get It Back\\" became the band's seventh and final domestic top ten single. Originally a remake of the same-titled unreleased Blaque single from 2002, Mis-Teeq and Telstar agreed not to use album version, instead releasing the alternate \\"Ignorants Radio Edit\\" as an official single version which entered the UK charts at number 8 on 12 July 2003. The song also was included on a Special Edition of Eye Candy which was released in December of the same year and spawned a third single with \\"Style\\". The song peaked at number 13. \\"Scandalous\\" was released in the US in May 2004 (under another label, Reprise Records) and reached number 35 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in June, making it their only single to chart in the US. The song was featured as the theme of the film Catwoman, starring Halle Berry, in Summer 2004. Also in 2004, Mis-Teeq began touring the US. After appearing on television shows such as Jimmy Kimmel, Pepsi smash and Carson Daly, the girls had built up their fan base. Unfortunately in 2005, the demise of their record label Telstar left Mis-Teeq in a situation where they were unsure of where to go or what to do next. Following the major release of their third album Mis- Teeq and the single \\"Scandalous\\" in 2004, the band's record label Telstar Records went bankrupt. After the announcement of their split in 2005, they released a compilation album, Greatest Hits, containing a new track, a cover of the Andrews Sisters 1940s song \\"Shoo Shoo Baby\\", and they were awarded a 2005 Soul Train Lady of Soul Nomination for Best R&B;/Soul Album - Group, Band or Duo for their album Mis-Teeq. On 9 February 2011, it was reported that the group were in talks to reform for a comeback tour but this was denied by Dixon. Two years later, Dixon said that she would never rule out a reunion. In September 2014, Su-Elise stated in an interview with Fashion Plus Magazine that the group were in talks and were working on a reunion album. Members Alesha Dixon was the group's rapper and joined in 1999, alongside Washington. She would also frequently take on second lead vocals on the group's records. However, she was best known for her distinct sounding rapping voice and usually sung live in performances for the group. Following the group's split, Dixon went on to embark on a highly successful solo career, releasing four studio albums to date and appearing on TV‚Äîfirstly as a winning competitor and then as a judge on Strictly Come Dancing and currently on Britain's Got Talent. As well as Strictly Come Dancing and Britain's Got Talent, Dixon also hosts Alesha's Street Dance Stars on CBBC. Su-Elise Nash, who joined the group in 1999, was the group's backing singer. Her vocals were rarely heard on the group's records. However, she added a lower register vocal to many of the group's harmonies, which was contribution to the group's sound. She was also a rapper, but only rapped on two of the group's records. Following the group's split, Nash has stayed out of the public eye. Sabrina Washington was the group's lead singer and joined the group in 1999 alongside Dixon. Sabrina had a very strong voice and would also rap on occasion. Following the group's split, Washington appeared on I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in 2010, and launched her solo career the same year. As of 2013, Washington was working on her debut solo album. Zena McNally joined the group in 1999 and released only one single with the group before leaving in 2001, Owing to wanting to pursue her own solo career. She released two solo singles in 2003, and worked as a radio presenter; she is mostly known for co-presenting on BBC Radio 1Xtra. McNally now resides in the United States with her husband Cory Gibbs. Tina Barrett left the line-up before any material had been released to become a member of the pop group S Club 7.
