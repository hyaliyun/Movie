A hesperidium (plural hesperidia) is a modified berry with a tough, leathery rind. Etymology Carl Linnaeus gave the name Hesperide√¶ to an order containing the genus Citrus, in allusion to the golden apples of the Hesperides. Development The outer ovary wall becomes the thick spongy layer of the rind, while the inner ovary wall becomes very juicy with several seeds. The peel contains volatile oil glands in pits. The fleshy interior is composed of separate sections, called carpels, filled with fluid-filled vesicles that are specialized hair cells. Uses Oranges, lemons, limes, and grapefruit are all common examples of hesperidia. Unlike most other berries, the rind of cultivated hesperidia is generally not eaten with the fruit because it is tough and bitter. A common exception is the kumquat, which is consumed entirely. The outermost, pigmented layer of rind contains essential oils and is known as the flavedo. When scraped off and used as a culinary ingredient it is called zest. A confection called succade can also be produced by candying the inner rind (known as pith or albedo) of the citron or lemon.

It undergoes Œ≤‚àí decay into yttrium-90, with a decay energy of 0.546 MeV. Strontium-90 has applications in medicine and industry and is an isotope of concern in fallout from nuclear weapons and nuclear accidents. Radioactivity Naturally occurring strontium is nonradioactive and nontoxic at levels normally found in the environment, but 90Sr is a radiation hazard. 90Sr undergoes Œ≤‚àí decay with a half-life of 28.79 years and a decay energy of 0.546 MeV distributed to an electron, an anti-neutrino, and the yttrium isotope 90Y, which in turn undergoes Œ≤‚àí decay with half-life of 64 hours and decay energy 2.28 MeV distributed to an electron, an anti-neutrino, and 90Zr (zirconium), which is stable.Decay data from National Nuclear Data Center at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in the US. Note that 90Sr/Y is almost a pure beta particle source; the gamma photon emission from the decay of 90Y is so infrequent that it can normally be ignored. 90Sr has a specific activity of 5.21 TBq/g. Fission product 90Sr is a product of nuclear fission. It is present in significant amount in spent nuclear fuel and in radioactive waste from nuclear reactors and in nuclear fallout from nuclear tests. For thermal neutron fission as in today's nuclear power plants, the fission product yield from U-235 is 5.7%, from U-233 6.6%, but from Pu-239 only 2.0%. Biological effects =Biological activity= Strontium-90 is a \\"bone seeker\\" that exhibits biochemical behavior similar to calcium, the next lighter group 2 element. After entering the organism, most often by ingestion with contaminated food or water, about 70‚Äì80% of the dose gets excreted. Virtually all remaining strontium-90 is deposited in bones and bone marrow, with the remaining 1% remaining in blood and soft tissues. Its presence in bones can cause bone cancer, cancer of nearby tissues, and leukemia. Exposure to 90Sr can be tested by a bioassay, most commonly by urinalysis. The biological half-life of strontium-90 in humans has variously been reported as from 14 to 600 days, 1000 days, 18 years, 30 years and, at an upper limit, 49 years. The wide-ranging published biological half life figures are explained by strontium's complex metabolism within the body. However, by averaging all excretion paths, the overall biological half life is estimated to be about 18 years. The elimination rate of strontium-90 is strongly affected by age and sex, due to differences in bone metabolism. Together with the caesium isotopes 134Cs, 137Cs, and iodine isotope 131I, it was among the most important isotopes regarding health impacts after the Chernobyl disaster. As strontium has an affinity to the calcium-sensing receptor of parathyroid cells that is similar to that of calcium, the increased risk of liquidators of the Chernobyl power plant to suffer from primary hyperparathyroidism could be explained by binding of strontium-90. Uses =Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs)= The radioactive decay of strontium-90 generates a significant amount of heat, 0.536 W/g in the form of pure strontium metal or approximately 0.256 W/g as strontium titanate and is cheaper than the alternative 238Pu. It is used as a heat source in many Russian/Soviet radioisotope thermoelectric generators, usually in the form of strontium titanate. It was also used in the US \\"Sentinel\\" series of RTGs. =Industrial applications= 90Sr finds use in industry as a radioactive source for thickness gauges. =Medical applications= 90Sr finds extensive use in medicine as a radioactive source for superficial radiotherapy of some cancers. Controlled amounts of 90Sr and 89Sr can be used in treatment of bone cancer, and to treat coronary restenosis via vascular brachytherapy. It is also used as a radioactive tracer in medicine and agriculture. =Aerospace applications= 90Sr is used as a blade inspection method in some helicopters with hollow blade spars to indicate if a crack has formed. 90Sr contamination in the environment Strontium-90 is not quite as likely as caesium-137 to be released as a part of a nuclear reactor accident because it is much less volatile, but is probably the most dangerous component of the radioactive fallout from a nuclear weapon. A study of hundreds of thousands of deciduous teeth, collected by Dr. Louise Reiss and her colleagues as part of the Baby Tooth Survey, found a large increase in 90Sr levels through the 1950s and early 1960s. The study's final results showed that children born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1963 had levels of 90Sr in their deciduous teeth that was 50 times higher than that found in children born in 1950, before the advent of large-scale atomic testing. Reviewers of the study predicted that the fallout would cause increased incidence of disease in those who absorbed strontium-90 into their bones. However, no follow up studies of the subjects have been performed, so the claim is untested. An article with the study's initial findings was circulated to U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1961, and helped convince him to sign the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty with the United Kingdom and Soviet Union, ending the above-ground nuclear weapons testing that placed the greatest amounts of nuclear fallout into the atmosphere.Hevesi, Dennis. \\"Dr. Louise Reiss, Who Helped Ban Atomic Testing, Dies at 90\\", The New York Times, January 10, 2011. Accessed January 10, 2011. The Chernobyl disaster released roughly 10 PBq, or about 5% of the core inventory, of strontium-90 into the environment. The Fukushima Daiichi disaster released 0.1-1 PBq of strontium-90 in the form of contaminated cooling water into the Pacific Ocean.

The goal of the game is to shoot ducks and then collect them with hunting dogs, a concept similar to that of the classic NES game, Duck Hunt. On October 19, 2007 a Nintendo Wii version was released by publisher Detn8, it was originally planned for release on July 10, 2007, but it was delayed to October due to the E3 announcement of the Wii port. Production values The second game from publisher Mid Carolina Media is often criticized on its own forums for low production values, many of which contradict the self-quoted title of \\"the most realistic duck hunting game ever made\\" on its cover. Many of the common criticisms include: *There is no indication whatsoever that the decoys, duck calls, or attire of the hunters have any impact on the gameplay although the game assures you that they do. *Firearms each contain five rounds prior to reloading while the legal limit for fowl hunting is three. *The Over-Under, a two-barreled shotgun, logically cannot hold five rounds. *Hunters are confined to very small areas in the center of six maps that offer almost identical gameplay despite different weather conditions. *When initially released, the online multiplayer function did not actually work. Since then, the website has suggested set times for players to come online and play without actually presenting its own players or bots, which combined with the already small community, renders the game's multiplayer feature almost unusable. *Ducks do not change their behavior even while under fire. *It is possible to see through the back of the shotguns in the first person view. Critical reception Despite the game box's assurances that Ultimate Duck Hunting is \\"the most realistic duck-hunting game ever made\\", it has earned harsh criticisms both based on the game itself and the professionalism shown by its publisher. Perhaps the most popular and cited feedback came from GameTrailers.com's Rob, whose stick figure persona actually hanged himself as a result of playing Ultimate Duck Hunting, which coined the term \\"suicide review\\". Over the course of GameTrailers' review, the late Rob delivers a laundry list of problems with the game. He criticizes the intelligence of the dogs used to retrieve fallen ducks and the repetitive dullness of the training process required to raise said intelligence. He likewise comments on the difficulty of finding anyone online to share the multiplayer mode with by showing a completely empty lobby. At one point, he ridicules the graphics of the allegedly \\"most realistic duck hunting game ever made\\" by presenting footage of a dog with brush poking through its body (a common symptom of low production values in videogames). Marketing failure Mid Carolina Media created a series of commercials for the game featuring a man choosing between women in lingerie and the game itself. They each open with the man sitting on a large bed loading the game with his laptop. A woman (not always the same woman) wearing revealing neglige enters the room and tries to pull him away from the game. These commercials feature more footage of the women than the game itself, though the man always chooses the game in the end. This attempt at marketing has not been very successful, however, as YouTube reports significantly more hits for the \\"suicide review\\" video bashing the game instead (see above).

Hinzman, who wrote, produced, edited, directed and starred in the film, is best known for playing the cemetery ghoul in George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead (1968). Plot The film starts with a group of kids taking a hayride in the country on Halloween. They pay the local farmer to take them to a secluded area of the forest. The kids arrive and begin drinking, telling the farmer to come back after dark to pick them up. As the party wears on the group separates to find their own little love nests. Meanwhile, the farmer has stumbled across a large tree stump which he proceeds to remove with the help of his tractor. Under the stump is a large wooden box with an ancient seal telling not to break open the box. The farmer breaks the seal and opens the box. Inside is the Bill Heinzman \\"Flesheater\\" who precedes to eat the farmer making him a zombie in the process. Both zombies head towards where the kids are. Two of the kids who retreated to the barn for some alone time are killed by the flesheaters. As the flesh-eater is killing the kids, two of their friends walk in and see what's happening then they run outside to warn the group at the party. Inside the barn the kids who were attacked become zombies and head out of the barn for fresh victims back near the party and one of the girls is attacked in the woods by the zombies. It tears a chunk of shoulder away but the girl is saved by her boyfriend who hears her screams and tackles the flesh-eater. The remaining kids retreat to the old \\"Spencers Farm\\" a dis- used farmhouse in the woods. They proceed to nail up the windows and doors. They manage to phone the police but the call is cut short when a zombie outside rips the phone line out. Meanwhile, the two kids who escaped from the barn have caught up with the group (who refuse to open the doors in case of an attack) so the two kids hide in the basement and lock the door. Upstairs the girl bitten on the shoulder dies and returns as a zombie. Just as she gets up the zombies outside break in and the remaining group are slaughtered, each becoming a zombie and heading into the woods for more victims. A police car then turns up at Spencer's farm responding to the cut-short phone call. The police officer is attacked by a group of zombies and left for dead. The kids in the basement open the door and see the body of the policeman. They take his gun and kill his half remaining zombie corpse and escape into the night. Some of the zombies find their way to a residential street where they proceed to eat a local family inside their home turning them into zombies in the process. The two kids find a local stable where they try to warn the owner about the coming attack. He goes inside the house to find that his wife has become a zombie. More zombies appear and the man is cornered and eaten alive and the kids flee again. They find a large barn where a Halloween party is being held. The kids try to warn the group about the undead but they laugh it off as Halloween nonsense. Soon the zombies arrive and slaughter the party-goers. The two kids who survived the basement find a hiding spot inside the framework of the barn. Back in town, the police department are assembling a posse after hearing of the officer who was killed at Spencer's farm. As daylight approaches the posse have arrived at the woods. They find zombies emerging from the woods and proceed to kill the creatures. They proceed through the woodland killing zombies as they go. The posse arrive at the barn and find the party-goers are all zombies. The posse kill them as the zombie group come out of the barn. The two kids hiding in the barn hear the gunshots and think they are saved. They exit the barn and are shot on sight by a sniper (the same actor who shoots Ben in Night of the living dead). The posse throws all the bodies inside the barn and barricade it shut. They set it on fire burning the remaining few zombies inside. The posse thinking they destroyed all the zombies head home. A few days later a police officer is checking out the remains of the barn when he is attacked by the original flesheater, who kills him and begins the outbreak over again. Alternate titles The film has been released under a number of alternate titles, including Zombie Nosh and Revenge of the Living Zombies. Release The film was released on VHS by Magnum Entertainment under the title Revenge of the Living Zombies in 1989. The film was released on DVD by Shriek Show in 2003. It can also be found packaged in the Zombie Pack, Vol. 2 alongside Burial Ground: The Nights of Terror and Zombie Holocaust.The Movies Made Me Do It - FleshEater The film was released in a 2-disc Blu-ray and DVD combo pack by Shriek Show in 2010.

The Technique of Orchestration, p.148-149. . Trombone seventh position harmonic series, lowest possible note E1. Note the gap of theoretically playable notes between E2 and B1, which players may fill in with falset tones. Falset is the latitude for a brasswind player's pitch-control of a harmonic by adjusting lip or air pressure. While only just sufficient in middle and high registers to allow for intonation adjustment, this latitude becomes very wide in the low register in the flattening direction. Without this ability for adjustment, the conventional system of three valves would be problematic owing to the sharpness of certain valve combinations. Previously also falset referred to falsetto. At B2 the pitch can sometimes be dropped by a fourth or more by means of what is often termed loose-lipping, a slackening of the embouchure which produces factitious pitches not included in the harmonic series. This term dates at least from 1620, when Michael Praetorius wrote about falset tones in articles concerning the cornett and sackbut in his Syntagma Musicum. The technique has been utilized in Horn playing from at least the eighteenth century. Works from the Classical period notes descend to low G (written in bass clef as G3). Mathematicians and music theorists from Mersenne onward have suggested explanations for these sounds. Recent efforts include a considerably revised view of the structure and genesis of the harmonic series. On the tenor trombones without F attachments, there is a gap between B1 (the fundamental in first position) and E2 (the first harmonic in seventh position). Skilled players can produce falset notes between these, but the sound is relatively weak and not usually used in performance. All notes emitted from the bazooka are produced purely in falset. Pitches are produced specifically by the player's lips as they vibrate and resonate in conjunction with the mouthpiece but not with the full tube length of the horn as is the case in the trombone.

He was born in R√≠o Piedras, Puerto Rico to Francisco and Francisca Lopez. His family relocated to Bronx, New York in 1954 where he attended Public School 66, Herman Ridder Junior High School (Public School 98), and Christopher Columbus High School (Bronx).criticalbench.com Early Life and Interest in Body Building As a boy, Anibal was fascinated with men of great muscular power who could perform amazing feats of strength. He read about Tarzan‚Äôs adventures in the comic books and watched former Olympic swimmerJohnny Weissmuller play the hero in the popular movie series. The first sport young Lopez participated in was gymnastics. He continued, however to be drawn to the ‚ÄúStrongmen‚Äù. His first glimpse of a bodybuilding icon was of Steve Reeves playing Hercules on the silver screen. Lopez would later recall, ‚ÄúThat was when the bodybuilding ‚Äòbug‚Äô really bit me.‚Äù Amazingly, decades later, Reeves himself would tell Lopez that he considered him to be one of his favorite bodybuilders.criticalbench.com Another early motivation for Anibal was seeing a guest posing exhibition by IFBB Hall of Fame bodybuilder Leroy Colbert, yet another childhood hero that decades later would become a personal friend. The next sport that Lopez excelled at was boxing. It wasn‚Äôt long, however, before his passion for both weightlifting and bodybuilding began to overtake his other sporting activities. He began to train at home with a barbell, a pair of dumbbells that he ordered from a Joe Weider magazine for $19.95 and a homemade wood bench. It was while living in the Throgsneck Projects in the Bronx that Lopez accelerated his weight training. He moved past using the meager equipment at home and started training at the sports center in the projects. It was at this time that he began to see impressive changes in his physique, both in size and strength. During this period of training at the Throgsneck center he won his first trophy in powerlifting. Career Lopez joined the AAU and entered his first novice bodybuilding contest, the ‚ÄúMr. Wagner‚Äù, named so because it was held at the Wagner Youth Center in Manhattan. To his great surprise, he won the over-all title at the show. His singular goal after that first show was to win the Mr. New York City title. It was the beginning of a long and successful run as a professional in the sport. Lopez also served in the United States Army with the 101st Airborne Division; He found that he loved the challenge of jumping out of an aircraft in flight. He later served with the 19th Special Forces Group (Airborne) in the National Guard and was credited with over 100 jumps, including 10 night jumps all from different aircraft. Now retired from competitive bodybuilding, Lopez continues to train and stay active in the sport. He resides in Deltona, Florida.

Laredo Independent School District is a public school district based in Laredo in Webb County, Texas, United States. The district serves the south central portion of Laredo. In 2009, LISD was rated \\"academically acceptable\\" by the Texas Education Agency. From 1947 to 1970, Laredo Community College, then known as Laredo Junior College, was, during the tenures of its first two presidents, W. J. Adkins and Ray A. Laird, under the jurisdiction of LISD prior to becoming a separate governing and taxing body. In 2007, LISD administrators began removing some 700 children from special education after the Texas Education Agency declared that the district had too many in the program because only 8.5 percent of the pupils enrolled could receive such special services. According to Maricela Gonzalez, an elementary school speech therapist, \\"We basically just picked kids and weeded them out. We thought it was unfair, but we did it.\\"Brian Rosenthal, \\"Schools purged kids from special ed,\\" San Antonio Express-News, October 23, 2016, pp. 1, A10, A11. Other Texas school districts also reduced their enrollments in special education. However, federal law requires public schools to provide special education to all eligible pupils with disabilities. LISD has been investigated to make certain that needy students can enroll in special education. In LISD, some 60 percent of pupils speak Spanish as their native language. In July 2013, LISD trustee Rick Garza proposed the return of corporal punishment into the code of student conduct. \\"I hear time and time again that the teachers are losing control of their classroom,\\" Garza said.JJ Velasquez, \\"Trustee wants paddle usage: Rick Garza eyes paddling as a discipline method\\", Laredo Morning Times, July 22, 2013, pp. 1, 12A. He said that current disciplinary methods are too lenient, exhaust district resources, and fail to control rowdy students. Then Superintendent Nelson said that paddling could be re-instituted by the board but would require parental consent and could not be used until a third offense. Nelson said the district would poll teachers anonymously to see if they supported the return of the paddle. \\"We live in a litigious society... They [parents] are looking for reasons to file litigation...\\" Nelson added. On November 5, 2013, district voters in a low-turnout election handily approved a $47.17 million school bond issue to refinance previously issued revenue bonds. The tabulation was 1,944 (73.1%) in support to 716 (26.9%) in opposition. In September 2014, then LISD superintendent A. Marcus Nelson was named \\"Superintendent of the Year\\" by the Texas Association of School Administrators and the Texas Association of School Boards at the annual convention of the two groups held in Dallas. Nelson, who took the Laredo position in August 2009, beat out four other contenders for the recognition.Judith Rayo, \\"LISD chief honored at state education convention\\", Laredo Morning Times, September 27, 2014, p. 1. With a salary of $206,000, his contract was set to expire in August 2020.

In 2017, Nelson left LISD to accept the superintendency at the Waco Independent School District in Waco, Texas. In 2014, twelve LISD schools fell short of minimum state standards and were placed on the Public Education Grant list. These included Martin High School, J. W.

He was a contemporary of Palestrina, writing music in a closely related style, and was a prominent composer and choir director in Rome in the late 16th century. Life He was born in Rome, but little documentation remains of his early life. In 1558 he is recorded as a singer at the Cappella Giulia (the Julian Chapel), and in 1561 he was already maestro di cappella of San Luigi de' Francesi; that he rose so quickly to such a prominent position indicates that he was probably a singer prior to the first mention of him at the Cappella Giulia. He retained the position at San Luigi de' Francesi until 1566, and from 1567 to 1570 he was maestro di cappella at St. John Lateran, one of the most prestigious musical posts in Rome. In 1570 he was succeeded there by Frenchman Bartolomeo Roy, and Zoilo left to sing as an alto in the choir of the Sistine Chapel, remaining there until July 1577, at which time he left due to illness. However, by October he was well enough to be appointed by Pope Gregory XIII, along with Palestrina, to edit and revise the music for the Graduale, as well as other liturgical music of the Church. Zoilo held several other positions after his career at the Sistine Chapel, including maestro di cappella at Todi Cathedral beginning in 1581, his first documented appointment outside of Rome; in 1584 he held a similar position at Santa Casa in Loreto. In addition to his various employments as choirmaster, he was associated with the Oratorio di SS Trinit√† dei Pellegrini e Convalescenti, in Rome, an organization which paid him on several occasions, possibly for compositions. Zoilo died in Loreto. Why he left Rome, the town of his birth, and the site of his success as a singer and choirmaster, is not documented, but he continued to compose music for the Sistine Chapel choir as late as 1582. Music Zoilo's music is similar to Palestrina's in style, using smoothly flowing contrapuntal lines with clear text declamation, with little of the experimental chromaticism and textural elements found in music in northern Italy or Naples at the same time. His sacred music is for four and eight voices, and includes masses, motets, hymns, responds, litanies, suffragia, and other a cappella vocal music. In addition to his sacred music, he published two books of madrigals. One of his madrigals, Chi per voi non sospira acquired considerable fame, being reprinted in many collections; in addition it was used by Vincenzo Galilei in his Fronimo: dialogo ... sopra l'arte del bene intavolare in a lute intabulation.

He is currently a Senior Advisor to the Toronto Maple Leafs. Some of his nicknames are the \\"Silver Fox\\" and \\"Trader Cliff\\". Career =Early positions= Fletcher started his career in 1956 for the Montreal Canadiens as a scout under Sam Pollock, then later became the General Manager of the Verdun Blues junior team. He joined the expansion St. Louis Blues in 1966 as a scout for Eastern Canada worked his way up to the assistant GM position. With Fletcher's help, the Blues advanced to the Stanley Cup finals in each of their first three years, a feat unmatched to this day. Fletcher's general manager career started in the Central Hockey League with the Kansas City Blues when he was awarded the top job in January 1971 during a mid-season shake-up that also saw John Choyce appointed as the team's new head coach.Major Shake-up At Kansas City - Windsor Star - Jan 12, 1971 In 1972, he accepted the opportunity to run an NHL team when offered the GM position in Atlanta. =Flames= Fletcher joined the newly minted expansion Atlanta Flames team as General Manager, remaining with the Flames in that capacity through and after the team's move to Calgary, Alberta in 1980. Over the next 10 years, he oversaw the Calgary Flames to two Smythe division titles, two Clarence S. Campbell Bowls as Campbell Conference Champions, and two Presidents' Trophies, given to the team with the best NHL Regular season record. During his tenure in Calgary, he was the first GM to bring a player from the Soviet Union when Sergei Priakin played in 1988. The Flames won the Stanley Cup Championship in 1989 against the Montreal Canadiens. He also served as the GM of Team Canada for the 1981 Canada Cup. =Maple Leafs= Fletcher moved to the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1991, to serve as Chief Operating Officer, President and General Manager. He made a blockbuster trade with Doug Risebrough, his successor as the Flames' General Manager, sending Gary Leeman, Michel Petit, Jeff Reese, Craig Berube, and Alexander Godynyuk to the Flames for Doug Gilmour, Jamie Macoun, Ric Nattress, Rick Wamsley and Kent Manderville on January 2, 1992. That year, Fletcher also hired Pat Burns as head coach for the upcoming season. The positive impact on the Toronto team was immediate. During the 1992‚Äì93 season, his second year as GM, the Leafs set team records with wins (44) and points (99), while Gilmour emerged as a superstar and scored a franchise-high 127 points. During the postseason awards ceremony, Gilmour finished as runner-up for the Hart Trophy and won the Frank J. Selke Trophy as best defensive forward, while Burns won the Jack Adams Award as coach of the year; the first major NHL individual awards that Leaf players had won since 1967. Fletcher himself was named as the \\"Man of the Year\\" and the \\"Executive of the Year\\" by The Hockey News in 1993. The Leafs reached the conference finals in 1993 and 1994 - the only team in the NHL to make it that far in the playoffs in both seasons and the only one of the seven teams from those two years to not make a Stanley Cup Final since expansion. He remained with the Toronto Maple Leafs for six seasons before retiring to Florida. =Lightning= In 1999, Fletcher joined the Tampa Bay Lightning as Senior Advisor to the GM for two seasons at the request of Jacques Demers, then Tampa's coach and GM. When Demers left the franchise in 1999, so did Fletcher. =Coyotes= Fletcher joined the Phoenix Coyotes on February 17, 2001 as General Manager and Executive Vice-President. On August 28, 2001, he passed his GM role to Mike Barnett and became Senior Executive Vice-President of Hockey Operations. On April 11, 2007, Fletcher and General Manager Mike Barnett were fired after the Coyotes finished the 2006‚Äì07 season with its worst record since relocating from Winnipeg to Phoenix in 1996. =Return to Toronto= Fletcher was officially named the interim general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs on January 22, 2008, replacing John Ferguson Jr. Fletcher signed a nineteen-month contract with the franchise; serving as GM for six months before becoming an executive for the Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment organization. He was replaced as GM of the Toronto Maple Leafs by Brian Burke. Team President Richard Peddie announced that Fletcher would likely be the general manager through the 2008-09 NHL season, although it was later announced on November 27, 2008 that Brian Burke had agreed to a six-year contract as the Maple Leafs' GM. Fletcher served the remainder of his contract with the Maple Leafs as an adviser for the Maple Leafs management team. During the off season of 2009, Fletcher signed a multi-year contract extension.

On 14 June 1647, he left for Barbados to gain his fortune in the New World, like many of his fellow countrymen. Ligon purchased half of a sugar plantation in Barbados. After two years residence on the island he was attacked by a fever, and returned to England in 1650. He was soon afterward put into prison by his creditors. There are conflicting reports as to whether his narrative was conceived of in prison as a way to pay off his creditors and gain his freedom, or before his imprisonment at the urging of Brian Duppa, Bishop of Salisbury. His work, a folio with maps and illustrations, is entitled A True and Exact History of the Island of Barbadoes and was published in London in 1657 and again in 1673. Importance in literary analysis Ligon's portrait of life in Barbados has made it into a number of literary journals and historical texts in an attempt by many scholars to derive exactly what life in the islands was like and exactly how Europeans, particularly the English, perceived slaves and their role in the sugar trade. One review in the journal Early American Literature (see citation below) offers a more linguistic approach to Ligon's texts. Author Thomas Krise reviews Keith A. Sandiford's analysis of words like \\"sweet\\" and \\"negotiation\\" in Ligon and says that such an analysis calls attention to various systems of contradiction present in our current understanding of Old World Caribbean culture.

Student athletes who have played under her have a 100 percent job placement following their career, and all of her recruited athletes have earned their degree. =University of Iowa= Bluder, alongside her husband David and daughters Hannah and Emma, and son, David, was introduced as the Hawkeyes' fifth head coach in front of a packed press room in Carver-Hawkeye Arena on April 7, 2000. The native of Marion, IA, came to Iowa after spending 10 successful seasons at Drake University. Bluder, the all-time winningest coach in program history, is in her 18th year as head women's basketball coach at the University of Iowa and her 34th year overall. Under her direction, the Hawkeyes have advanced to 16 postseason appearances (12 NCAA and four WNIT) in 17 seasons, including NCAA Tournament berths in eight of the last 10 seasons.

The Hawkeyes were nationally ranked for 14 weeks during the season, reaching No. 14 in the Associated Press Poll and No. 13 in the ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll. Iowa received an at-large berth into the NCAA Tournament for the fourth-straight season. Another one of Bluder's best seasons was the 2018-19 when she and her star player, Megan Gustafson, who would later go onto the WNBA with the Dallas Wings. They finished with a 29-7 record; with a Big Ten Tournament Championship and a trip to the Elite Eight in the 2019 NCAA Tournament. They finished No. 8 in the Postseason AP Top 25.

The event was held in Toronto, Canada from July 16‚Äì20, 2015. Bluder's USA team had a strong roster, including 2015 All-Americans Breanna Stewart, Moriah Jefferson, and Tiffany Mitchell. The USA team secured a 75‚Äì69 win over Brazil in its opening game, followed by a lopsided 94‚Äì55 win over Dominican Republic in the second round. In its final preliminary round game, the USA outscored Puerto Rico 93‚Äì77 to secure a number one seed heading into the medal semifinals. Bluder's team survived a close semi-final game against Cuba with a 65‚Äì64 win that advanced the USA into the gold medal game. The USA team led Canada in the championship game by as much as 11 points early on, but a strong third quarter by Canada gave them the lead, and an eventual 81‚Äì73 win over the USA women. Bluder and her team returned home from Toronto with a silver medal. Bluder served as an assistant coach of the USA representative to the 1999 World University Games (also known as the Universiade). The event was held in Palma de Mallorca, Spain. The USA team opened with a 134‚Äì37 win over South Africa. The second game was against Canada, which the USA team lost in a close match 68‚Äì67. The USA could not afford to lose another game if they wished to win a medal, and won the next game against Japan 106‚Äì66. The USA next faced undefeated Russia, and fell behind by twelve points at halftime, but came back and won the game 79‚Äì68. The USA fell behind in their next game against undefeated China, but rallied and went on to win 89‚Äì78. The USA then beat Brazil to advance to the semi-final, where they faced Lithuania. The game was not close, with the USA winning 70‚Äì49. That set up a rematch with China, on their home court with 18,000 spectators. The USA only had a four-point lead at halftime, but did better in the second half, and won 87‚Äì69 to claim the gold medal. Ayana Walker set a World University Games record with 19 rebounds in the game. Walker was the leading scorer and rebounder for the USA team with 15.4 points and 8.6 rebounds per game. Head coaching record Drake was awarded a forfeit victory over Valparaiso during the 1995‚Äì96 season due to Valparaiso's use of an ineligible player. Drake originally lost that game 79‚Äì80. Drake recognizes that game as a victory, but the NCAA does not, thus the NCAA statistics database includes a record of 15‚Äì4 for that year.

The longest-running (and only remaining original) character, Jill was created and introduced by William J. Bell. Originally portrayed by Brenda Dickson, when Dickson departed in 1980, the role was first recast with Deborah Adair. Dickson returned in 1983, and although she stated that she would never leave the role again, she was replaced by Jess Walton in 1987, who continues in the role to present time. When she debuted, Jill was an 18-year-old manicurist working to support her struggling family. The character is known for her feud with Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper); it is the longest feud in the history of American soap operas. Their rivalry began when she fell in love and slept with Katherine's husband Phillip Chancellor II (Donnelly Rhodes) and became pregnant. Following Phillip's accidental death, the women fought over custody of Jill's son, Phillip Chancellor III (Thom Bierdz), as well as numerous of Katherine's other husbands. A 2003 plot twist shockingly revealed Jill to be Katherine's long lost biological daughter, although in 2009, former head writer Maria Arena Bell rewrote their history, reversing that decision. In 2010, Jill discovered she is the daughter of Neil Fenmore (Jim Storm). The character is described as an integral part of the soap opera. Both Dickson and Walton have characterized her as \\"manipulative\\". Walton, who classes her as a \\"savvy businesswoman\\", has opined she is similar to Gone with the Wind character Scarlett O'Hara. Critics have described her as both vindictive and a vixen. John Goudas of The Miami News said that the show \\"flourishes when her character takes center stage\\", while Nekeeta Borden of Zap2it noted that Jill has always craved a sense of belonging despite her personality. Walton's portrayal has been met with acclaim, for which she has won two Daytime Emmy Awards. Casting Dickson debuted as the character on the second episode of the series. Footage of Dickson as Jill appears in the film Taxi Driver. On January 9, 1980, Dickson left the role. In May 1980, Bond Gideon briefly took over before Adair portrayed the character for an additional three years, from 1980 to 1983. Dickson returned to the role on September 8, 1983. Melinda Fee served a temporary recast also in 1984, and Adair briefly reprised the role in 1986 as a fill-in for Dickson. In 1987, when asked if she would ever leave the character of Jill again, Dickson stated: \\"I'm planning to branch out, maybe even a miniseries. But [that] only means shooting here at night to fill in. I can't give up Jill. I'm having too much fun with her. Besides, it's all so easy.\\" Despite this, Dickson was later replaced by Walton: first serving as a temporary replacement on June 19, 1987; then as a permanent recast airing on June 25, 1987. Dickson briefly vacated the role on June 18, 1987, due to illness. Dickson returned on June 22, 1987 and ultimately made her final appearance as Jill on June 24, 1987. In March 2009, speculation arose that Walton had taken a medical leave; however, Nelson Branco of TV Guide Canada reported that she had been asked to accept a salary cut and had decided to leave. The soap opera issued a casting call for Jill, describing her as \\"late '50s, Caucasian, female. This woman is a smart and confident CEO of a successful company. She is a mother and grandmother who wants what is best for her family.\\" However, soon after, Walton was able to sign a new contract to continue her portrayal of Jill. She later clarified her departure as having to do with \\"family and this economy\\". She stated: \\"I felt so bad that so many people have lost their jobs, that, all of a sudden, I thought: 'This is really silly. I have a wonderful job and I really think I owe it to myself and my family to continue on.'\\" In February 2012, Walton signed a new contract with the soap opera, which would continue her portrayal of the role for an unspecified amount of time. The actress was then announced to be taking a leave of absence beginning that April, slated to last six months. She made her return on November 2, 2012. After her return, Walton announced in an interview with Soap Opera Digest that she had voluntarily dropped to recurring status to allow for more time with her family. Development  =Characterization= Global BC describes Jill as \\"driven and ambitious\\". Lilana Novakovich of the Toronto Star stated she was \\"one mean lady\\", and later noted her to be manipulative. Dickson was \\"delighted\\" when viewers compared Jill to Alexis Colby (Joan Collins) on the television series Dynasty, and believed that Jill could give \\"lessons in rottenness\\" to Alexis. While Jill, still portrayed by Dickson, was in a middle of a custody battle for her son, John Goudas of The Miami News said: \\"Jill is hot again this winter. In a court battling for her son she never gave a darn about, quixotic Jill Foster Abbott gives The Young and the Restless a few heady jolts.\\" Additionally, he described Jill as a \\"two-timing, self-absorbed, vindictive little witch\\" who fans always sympathize with. In 1992, Donna Gable of USA Today described Jill as volatile. In 1994, Walton described her character as, \\"Very much like a latter-day Scarlett O'Hara. She is very manipulative and feels she is strongly justified in her actions. Jill is an individual who has a lot of difficulty in seeing what she truly is.\\" Additionally, she said that once Jill \\"she gets a plan in her head, nothing will divert her.\\" In 1998, Walton's co-star Jeanne Cooper described Jill as \\"Wile E. Coyote\\". Walton conceded that the analogy is true, saying that Jill is in \\"constant turmoil\\". She stated: \\"She gets the anvil dropped on her head and falls off the cliff. She cries and then tells everyone her new plan and how she's going to rule the world. Then it's off the cliff again.\\" Walton has said that Jill \\"can be such a shrew\\" and \\"gets her happiness where she can, and she certainly is not going to contain her anger. She lets it out, so it does not fester in there. She is on a roller coaster though, I will say that much.\\" In 2009, Walton stated that she had \\"really missed Jill being bad\\", but upon the character crashing Katherine's wedding to Patrick Murphy (Michael Fairman), she said that \\"this is pretty bad\\". Walton stated in an interview in 2003 that she does like portraying the \\"dark side\\" of Jill, but rather her comedic side. She also described Jill as being \\"so strong\\" and \\"such a survivor\\". Jill is known as a businesswoman, after working as a manicurist during her youth. Walton has said that she wants to see Jill's business side incorporate into the storyline more, stating: \\"That's what Jill has always done, and she does it well. She was a really successful businesswoman. Jill did a lot of foolish things, but she was a savvy businesswoman.\\" Additionally, Walton described Jill's business as the \\"core of the whole character\\", stating: \\"Jill is really a part of me ‚Äì this is a unique job in that part of me does live as Jill, and I know Jill is a very savvy businesswoman.\\" =Relationships= Walton said that \\"Jill is attracted to powerful men\\" but is a \\"bossy little lady\\" who isn't going to \\"buckle under\\" to them. She romanced many of Katherine's husbands, including Rex Sterling (Quinn Redeker). Walton said that their romance was \\"great\\" but \\"he only fell in love with her because the real Katherine had been spirited away and a fake Katherine was in her place\\". Walton described Jill's romance Sean Bridges (David Lee Russek), who was a young web designer, as a \\"boy toy\\". Jill is known for infidelity, Nekeeta Borden of Zap2it noted that she has slept with Katherine's husbands and had an affair with Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman) while she was married to his own father, John Abbott (Jerry Doulgas). Former head writer Kay Alden called her affair with Jack \\"massive\\" and it was \\"devastating to both of them\\" when it broke up her marriage to John. Lydna Hirsch of Sun Sentinel noted that after the affair, John threw Jack out of the house and divorced Jill; he forgave them years later but it took \\"Jack being paralyzed and Jill dealing with the death of her son Philip to get him to come around\\". Several years later, Walton said that John was one of the character's \\"best matches\\" because \\"Jill had a real love and respect for him ‚Äì I just don't think she had the physical passion for him so she got restless.\\" Of her relationship with ex-con Larry Warton (Shark Fralick), Walton said: \\"Larry Warton was hilarious; he was really, really fun. I loved doing that, because that was almost all comedy, all the time.\\" After years of not having a relationship, Jill has a brief romance with district attorney William Bardwell (Ted Shackelford) in 2007, which ends when Gloria Abbott (Judith Chapman) schemes to have him for herself. She later has a relationship with businessman Ji Min Kim (Eric Steinberg), who became her fianc√©, however, he was murdered before they were able to marry. Jill's most recent relationship was with Cane Ashby's (Daniel Goddard) father, Colin Atkinson (Tristan Rogers). He had a criminal past, angering Katherine, who was protective of Jill. Allison Waldman of AOL TV wrote: \\"Is he sincere, or is Colin just using Jill to get to Cane?\\" Jill accepted his \\"insane marriage offer\\" and considered eloping. Walton said that Colin was a \\"good match\\" for Jill and she hoped that she could \\"reform\\" him. Amid everyone telling Jill that she should stay away from Colin, Walton said: \\"She's only seeing the good in him. I really believe there's a real love between those two, and we're playing it like there is.\\" Their marriage was later declared invalid after Genevieve Atkinson (Genie Francis) revealed that she and Colin were still married. =Feud with Katherine= Jill is known for her feud with Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper), which took place over four decades. BuddyTV wrote that, \\"Nothing spells rivalry like the on-going feud between Jill Foster Abbott and Katherine Chancellor.\\" In 1993, Katherine was diagnosed with breast cancer and shared several tender scenes with Jill. Nancy Reichardt of the Los Angeles Times noted that the characters were acting out of character; she wrote: \\"Katherine's breast cancer scare was touching and seeing Katherine and Jill come together added an intriguing new dimension to their relationship. To confuse us, the show has thrown out this budding friendship as if it never happened. How much more moving it would have been if these two women faced Katherine's request for Jill to name her child Phillip as former adversaries trying to put the past behind them instead of as bitter enemies of days gone by.\\" Of working with Cooper, Walton has stated: \\"I thank God every day for that woman. She feeds me. She is like a shot in the arm when you see her in the morning. She is funny and sharp and I love her.\\" In 2003, Katherine and Jill were believed to be mother and daughter after Katherine's friend, Charlotte Ramsey, provided factual proof. Of the storyline, Walton stated: \\"She's [Abbott] going down a bad road. In looking back over the past 16 years, she's gone down a lot of bad roads, for a lot of different reasons. She'll survive this one and, hopefully, maybe this time she'll learn something from it.\\" She also described Jill as being in a \\"soul-searching period\\" during the storyline, saying: \\"Now she's numbing herself with the alcohol because all those feelings of love are coming up for her mother, and she doesn't know how to deal with them.\\" Walton said she felt Jill had been \\"shaken to the very foundation\\" upon the revelation that Katherine is her mother, stating: \\"A big part of who she has been all these years has to do with her anger towards Katherine. She always shoved any feeling of love down. Now, she's questioning everything about herself. That's why she is in such pain and why she is drinking. That hate thing is baseless now.\\" While admitting to having been surprised with the maternity revelation, Walton thought it was \\"fabulous and rich, and it's opened up a whole new facet to the story\\". However, in 2009, the characters' history was rewritten by Maria Arena Bell; Charlotte had made up this information for revenge against Katherine, and they were not mother and daughter. A writer from the Jamaica Gleaner noted that viewers had been getting restless with Jill's newfound closeness to Katherine, noting that, \\"Katherine and Jill are at their best when they are at each other's throats.\\" Of the storyline where she returned to Jabot Cosmetics, Cooper stated: \\"Since I went back into the business of business, I've been taking away some of Jill's power. You wanna go broke? Leave your company in the hands of Jill! The other day, we were filming some confrontational scenes, and Jess [Walton] says, 'Doesn't it feel good?' And the crew is like: 'Good! The girls are at it again!'\\" Lilana Novakovich of The Record noted that the rivalry between the two women has \\"outlived most marriages\\". Cooper stated: \\"The audience ‚Äì both young and old ‚Äì relate to the Kay/Jill relationship\\". Walton describes their relationship as \\"incredible\\" and said: \\"The love and the hate is so mixed, and there is never any telling when it will bubble out now. It used to be, ‚ÄúThis month I like her... this month I hate her.‚Äù Now, it‚Äôs more from moment to moment.\\" =Paternal discovery= In June 2010, when Jill's adoptive mother, Liz Foster (Julianna McCarthy), died, it was then learned that her biological father was Neil Fenmore. Walton stated: \\"Liz was the dream mother for Jill. She always could handle Jill.\\" During an interview with On-Air On-Soaps speaking about how her character has been thrown in different directions, Walton said: \\"It used to bother me. I would try and keep a steady course with it, and now I can‚Äôt. Now I just roll with the punches. It‚Äôs impossible.\\" Walton noted that Jill was finally happy to have a blood relative through Neil's other daughter, Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman). She said: \\"Liz dies within a week and all of a sudden it‚Äôs, 'I am a Fenmore'. And we really didn‚Äôt have a chance to explore it much, but in real life that happens. My first thought as Jill is, 'I actually know who my blood is, and I have a sister.' And, Jill was very moved and touched and shocked from the death of Liz, but full of love for her sister.\\" On her relationship with Lauren, Walton stated that, \\"Most people don‚Äôt like Jill, and she hasn‚Äôt particularly loved Lauren. I have never had that much to do with Lauren, really.\\" Nekeeta Borden of Zap2it noted: \\"The redhead told Jill in no uncertain terms that she intended to keep her father‚Äôs memory, and only child status, firmly in tact [sic] and had no interest in a close relationship.\\" Borden also noted that Jill always wanted a sense of belonging, which prompted her to legally change her name to Jill Fenmore. The sisters were initially bitter towards each other having to share half of the Fenmore Boutique, but have since gotten closer. Walton said that, \\"From my point of view, I think that Lauren has a really big heart; she's a naturally lovely person. Lauren was really awful a few times, and that just came out of her pain. So, it looks like Lauren and Jill are kind of getting along okay, but there's nothing else coming up in the scripts for them yet.\\" =Heart disease= In February 2017, after learning that her husband Colin stole her life savings (millions of dollars), Jill suffers from a near- fatal heart attack. In the weeks leading up to this, she had been experiencing feelings of warmth and jaw aching. Nancy Brown of The Huffington Post noted: \\"In typical fashion, she blamed the warmth on others keeping the heat turned up and dismissed the jaw pain to likely grinding her teeth at night.\\" She is subsequently diagnosed with heart disease and blocked arteries, something she struggles to accept. The storyline idea was developed by head writer and co- executive producer Sally Sussman Morina. For this storyline, the soap opera partnered with the American Heart Association in order to highlight the issue of women's heart health. Executive producer Mal Young felt that the character of Jill was the \\"perfect choice to show how a woman‚Äôs life can dramatically change as a result of heart disease.\\" He further mentioned that \\"Along with providing us with some very emotional and dramatic episodes, the subject also gives us the opportunity to educate and highlight a very pertinent issue using characters our viewers know well. As well as seeing how it affects Jill as she comes to terms with her condition, the story will also illustrate how it impacts her family and those closest to her.\\" The producers considered Jill to be the right character to tackle this issue due to her being the show's longest-running character, as well as other factors: her unhealthy lifestyle, age and \\"bullish personality that would deny anything was wrong\\". Following the episode where Jill is diagnosed, Walton appeared in a public service announcement urging viewers to visit the American Heart Association website. Young knew that the soap opera had to be \\"very responsible\\", stating: \\"We did not want to sensationalize this. We wanted to get the facts in while at the same time telling a good, dramatic story.\\" Storylines =Backstory= Jill Foster was born in Genoa City, Wisconsin. She is raised by her mother, Liz Foster, and her two older brothers, Snapper (William Gray Espy) and Greg (James Houghton). The family struggles to make ends meet and things aren't easy when their father, Bill abandons them. Liz Foster worked at Mr Chancellor's factory, and Jill worked at a beauty shop, to help support their family, and put her brothers through college. Jill had aspirations of being a model. In 2003, Jill's birth certificate confirmed the year of her birth as September 29, 1957. =1973‚Äì= Jill was working at a beauty shop to help support her family, until a regular at the shop, the wealthy Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper), hires her as a hairdresser and paid companion. \\"Jill tolerated Kay's habits of regularly drinking herself into oblivion and smoking to such an extent that her husband Phillip Chancellor, couldn't stand to be near her. Jill pitied Kay, and desperately, wanted to do everything in her power to help her.\\" \\"All of Jill's many acts of kindness and great patience toward Katherine did not escape Phillip's notice and he became inexorably drawn to the innocent and beautiful young lady.\\"The Young and the Restless Special Silver Anniversary Collector's Edition p.19 Since Phillip wanted nothing to do with his wife, Kay shamefully carried on with Jeff the stable boy, meanwhile Jill & Phillip Chancellor II were falling deeply in love, even though they were fighting their feelings for each other at every turn.The Young and the Restless Special Silver Anniversary Collector's Edition p.21 But eventually Phillip and Jill (who was a virgin) gave into their feelings and made love. It was the only time they had ever sex, but Jill became pregnant. Phillip divorced Kay so he could marry Jill. But \\"Upon Phillip's return from the Dominican Republic, a stone sober Katherine met him at the airport and offered to drive him home.\\" Kay begged him for a second chance when Phillip refused, Kay purposely drove them off a cliff.The Young and the Restless Special Silver Anniversary Collector's Edition p.28 As Phillip \\"lay dying in his hospital bed, he had one last request to make of his beloved Jill:marry him to give their unborn child his name and his fortune!\\" The Young and the Restless Most Memorable Moments p.80 But after Phillip's death Kay waged an endless round of legal maneuvers, which invalidated Phillip's divorce from her, and his marriage to Jill. So \\"Jill and her family were evicted from the Chancellor Estate, where they had been living since Phillip's death.\\" Jill gave birth to Phillip Chancellor II's baby, Phillip Chancellor III (eventually portrayed by Thom Bierdz in 1986), which sets off a rivalry between the ladies that would last for decades. Kay's son, Brock, would try numerous ways to broker a peace between the two of them, but the plans never worked out. Since Katherine had invalidated Jill's marriage, she was left penniless with a newborn infant. Kay offered Jill $1 million for her baby, which she declined. Jill later romances David Mallory, who was the recipient of her late father Bill's eye cornea. However, she never loved him. He proposed, but she declines after Liz warned her of a loveless marriage. She had an affair with Derek Thurston (Joe Ladue) and later romanced Stuart Brooks (Robert Colbert), whose wife Jennifer had just died. He was really in love with her mother Liz, but Jill tricked him into marriage following a one-night stand. He left her after she faked a pregnancy and miscarriage. Jill wanted to reunite with Derek, who marries Katherine after she promised him a salon and a $100,000 trust for Jill's son. Derek's ex-wife Suzanne Lynch (Ellen Weston) arrives in town and wanted him back. Kay was briefly presumed dead and finding himself free of Suzanne and Kay, Derek planned to marry Jill. Kay showed up alive at the wedding and reclaimed her life with Derek. Jill begins to work for cosmetics company Jabot and its owner, John Abbott (Jerry Douglas), promotes her to head of merchandising, impressed by her work. They become involved, but she cheated on him with his son, Jack Abbott (Terry Lester). John dumped her and she filed a sexual harassment suit worth $10,000 against Jack when he will not be with her. She reunites with John and they married in 1982. However, Abbott family housekeeper, Mamie Johnson (Veronica Redd), seemed to be a thorn in Jill's new marriage. Mamie, who wants to protect John, kept and eye on Jill, who had another affair with Jack. Katherine gets a hold of pictures of Jack and Jill and showed them to John, who has a stroke. Jill divorced John in 1986 and gets 20% of Jabot in their settlement, and a seat on the board of directors after threatening to sell her story turning it into a novel or film. Jill strives at her business, but is later found in her shower having been shot, just as her son Phillip returned to town after years away at boarding school. The three main suspects in the shooting are John, Jack, and Katherine. Jack confesses so that his affair with her won't become public. The real culprit is Sven, a masseur at the Genoa City Hotel. He had been rejected by Jill earlier in the night and shot her after getting drunk. Sven kidnapped Jill and locked her in a meat freezer. Jack rescued her and Sven escaped. Jill and Katherine fight over custody of her son Phillip, who is now a teenager and had a past of acting out. Kay was awarded temporary custody, but she was denied the right to adopt him. So much to Jill's dismay, Phillip III lives his high school years at the Chancellor mansion with Kay. After graduation Kay bought Phillip a shiny red sports car, and has Phillip begin his training as an executive at Chancellor Industries, in hopes he will take over his father's company someday. Phillip turned to alcoholism but quit with help from Jill and Katherine. Phillip has sex with Nina Webster (Tricia Cast) and she ends up pregnant. He later died after driving under the influence, devastating both women. Jill hired a former con man Rex Sterling (Quinn Redeker) to seduce Katherine. Rex's real name was Brian Romalotti, father of Danny Romalotti (Michael Damian) and Gina Roma (Patty Weaver). He married Katherine, but Jill then wanted Rex for herself and convinced him to divorce Katherine. In reality, Katherine had been replaced by a look alike Marge Cotrooke who pushed Rex away. He divorced her, and married Jill, but the real Katherine finally returned and reunited with Rex. Rex eventually was shot and killed while Jill began romancing John again. Jill begins an affair with wealthy Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) and was convinced he would ask her to marry him, but he told her it was just a fling. Mortified, she quickly remarried John, much to the dismay of his children. Jill wanted another child, but John felt he was too old. She quickly got pregnant before he had a secret vasectomy. He wanted her to have an abortion but she didn't, and gave birth to Billy Abbott (Billy Miller). John and Jill continuously had arguments and she had an affair with Jed Sanders. Mamie found out and told John, ending the marriage. They had a bitter custody battle, but John suffered another stroke. Mamie confessed her love to John; Jill then paid her millions to leave town. John gained custody of Billy and left for New York. Later, Jill found a letter from Phillip Chancellor II which named her the sole owner of the Chancellor Estate; she evicted Katherine. Katherine found a legal loophole, allowing her to stay on the estate. Billy Abbott and Brock Reynold's teenage daughter MacKenzie Browning began a romance. Jill had a brief romance with a young web designer, Sean Bridges (David Lee Russek). Katherine allowed ex-con Larry Warton (Shark Fralick) to move in for housework, and Jill had an affair with him but kept it secret because of his social class. Katherine found out and confronted Jill, who denied it. Jill even insulted Larry, causing him to show up at a Jabot board meeting and expose the affair. In 2003, Liz was diagnosed with a brain tumor and admitted to Jill that she was adopted and that Charlotte Ramsey provided proof that she was Katherine's daughter. Everyone was shocked that she is the daughter of her sworn enemy, and Katherine suffered a heart attack. They were forced to break up Billy and Mackenzie from marrying, because them being mother and daughter meant that Mac and Billy are cousins. Jill helped Katherine recover from paralysis and they begin to work out their issues. Four years later, Katherine uncovers repressed memories of kidnapping Phillip III years ago just after he was born and switching him with another baby. Jill refused to believe this at first, DNA testing of the corpse in Phillip III's grave confirms that he was not Jill's biological son. They are led to be believe that her true biological son is Ethan \\"Cane\\" Ashby (Daniel Goddard), an Australian national whose visa has expired and is fighting deportation. As the true Phillip III, he would be a native-born American citizen and is thus permitted to remain in Genoa City. Cane bonded with Katherine and Jill. She began a romantic relationship with District Attorney William Bardwell (Ted Shackelford), the District Attorney, who has just inherited a fortune from his late uncle. John Abbott's widow Gloria Abbott (Judith Chapman) also wanted Will, and drugged Ji Min Kim (Eric Steinberg) and Jill with libido pills and arranged for William to walk in on them. William married Gloria. Jill developed real feelings for Ji Min develop genuine feelings, they plan to marry. He is murdered in September by David Chow, devastating Jill. In 2008, Katherine retires as CEO of Chancellor Industries and made Jill her successor. She stepped down and made Cane CEO, angering Billy. In November, Katherine \\"dies\\" in a car accident. However, the true victim is her lookalike, Marge Cotrooke. Katherine returned months later alive and is proved to be her by DNA testing. However, the test also uncovers the truth ‚Äì Jill is not Katherine's biological daughter, and Charlotte Ramsey made this up to get back at Kay. She rejected Katherine's affection despite this, and their feud is reignited. Jill briefly goes broke after a bank in Cayman Islands where she has stored all her money collapsed. It is eventually learned the Cane is not Jill's son, and that Phillip is really alive and had faked his death and told Cane to come to Genoa City and pretend to be Jill's son. It is learned that Phillip is gay. Initially angry, Jill forgives Cane, who she has a bond with. She split her estate three ways between Phillip, Billy, and Cane‚Äîdespite the fact that Cane is not her son. In June 2010, Liz fell ill again and was dying. Jill reunited with her adoptive brothers Greg and Snapper who returned to town. Liz died in hospital with her children by her side. Snapper ended up telling Jill the truth, Neil Fenmore was her biological father. Jill changed her name to Fenmore and now had access to half of everything Fenmore, including Lauren's boutique. Lauren rejected her and they form a bitter feud; they eventually calmed down and became closer. Jill became engaged to Australian businessman Colin Atkinson (Tristan Rogers). Unbeknownst to her, he is Cane's biological father and the head of an organized crime syndicate in Australia. Cane was shot and \\"killed\\" on the day of her wedding to Colin, however it was actually Caleb (Cane's twin) that died. Jill found out that Colin was married to a woman named Genevieve Atkinson (Genie Francis), Cane's mother. Jill ended things with Colin and he was sent to jail for his crimes. In 2012, Jill leaves town for several months to help Phillip in Australia. Upon her return, she agrees to help Katherine come out of retirement to take control of Chancellor Industries, but Katherine ends up with a brain tumor. She has the tumor successfully removed and leaves town indefinitely with Murphy. Murphy later returns to Genoa City alone, revealing Katherine died while they were away. She leaves Nikki and Jill in charge of her funeral arrangements, and during this time Jill begins trying to figure out cryptic messages left by Katherine in a personal letter to her. Jill expected Katherine to have left everything to her in her will, but she only ends up with the Chancellor Estate, for which she can't afford the upkeep, and a mysterious music box. Jill tries for months to figure out the meaning of the music box and finally decides to sell it online, only to have Esther (Kate Linder) buy it back for her as she believes it truly means something. Jill is later kidnapped by Colin, who is revealed to have been released from jail. He blackmails her into remarrying him as he alludes that he has information on the music box that Katherine once told him. However, his information ends up being a dead end. After Colin's lies are exposed, Jill locks him in the attic and refuses to let him out until he owns up to his lies, which he eventually does and they patch things up. Almost a year after Katherine's death, Jill finds her most expensive jewelry to have been hidden in a chandelier at the Chancellor Estate. Enclosed with a note, Katherine left them there for Jill to find before her death as they are worth a significant amount. However, the meaning of the music box remains unknown to everyone. Afterward, all of Katherine's loved ones receive letters from her that were to be delivered on the one-year anniversary of her death. She also asks them to throw a party and celebrate, which they do. Once the party in the park is finished, Jill leaves the music box there, only for it to be stolen by an unidentified person. Jill and Colin return soon after to find the box missing, but Colin convinces her to finally let go of it. Years later, the box was found. This time, a key was found hidden in a secret compartment. It led to Collin finding a safe deposit box with a letter from Katherine and a ring from Phillip for Jill. Reception  John Goudas of The Miami News noted that following Dickson's return in 1984 following a four-year absence, the soap opera's ratings gained. Goudas praised Dickson, noting that, \\"Y&R; flourishes when her character takes center stage.\\" Jillian Bowe of Zap2it was critical of Dickson's portrayal, stating: \\"When contemplating the four decades of feuding between Genoa City‚Äôs grande dame Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) and hellcat [Jill] on The Young and the Restless, cartoon characters don't necessarily spring to mind ‚Äî okay, maybe during the Brenda Dickson years.\\" Jamey Giddens, also of Zap2it, described her portrayal as \\"cheesetastic\\". Head writer Josh Griffith stated that he \\"adores\\" Walton, saying that he's \\"always thought Jill was an integral character to the show\\". Of Jill's long-standing feud with Katherine, Global TV wrote: \\"Katherine vs. Jill The ongoing feud between Katherine Chancellor and Jill Foster Abbott sets a record as daytime's longest rivalry. For nearly 27 years, these two women have been constantly getting in the way of the each other's happiness. Whether it's over men, money, or the custody of a child, Katherine and Jill are always in direct competition.\\" In 2008, Tommy Garrett of Canyon News awarded Walton a \\"Daytime Gold Standard\\" for her portrayal. He stated: \\"Walton played each scene in this ‚ÄúBette Davis-like‚Äù emotional marathon of a week. How did Walton do it? With aplomb and greatness.\\" The following year, when Jill opened her own nail salon, Mike Jubinville, also of Zap2it, noted that the character had \\"stepped into a time warp\\". Prior to being paired with Colin, Nekeeta Borden wrote that, \\"Jill Foster Abbott (cough, cough) Fenmore‚Äôs (Jess Walton) Jimmy Choos must have crossed paths with a black cat, because she can‚Äôt find a good man to bless her somewhat shriveled heart.\\" Of the character's possible pairing with Colin, she added: \\"I, for one, hope that Maria Arena Bell and Co. keep Colin in Genoa City and surprise us all by making him a dream lover for Jill. She is a multidimensional character with a lot of fire, and a great capacity to be soft and vulnerable. Goodness knows she‚Äôs been through the . Can Jill find love with Colin, or will her newest dalliance lead to heartbreak?\\" In 2013, Giddens wrote of Walton's portrayal throughout her run, stating: \\"Unlike most soap opera recasts, where success or failure depends on chemistry with an opposite sex romantic lead, newcomer Jess Walton would sink or swim, based on her ability to connect with fellow female powerhouse Jeanne Cooper, who played Jill's bitter rival Katherine \\"Kay\\" Chancellor.\\" He also commended Walton and Cooper's portrayal of their characters' rivalry, \\"To say Walton swam alongside Cooper would be an understatement. The two women did a backstroke even Ryan Lochte and Michael Phelps would have to admire, during their 26 years as acting partners,\\" he wrote. Walton won a Daytime Emmy Award in 1997 for Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her portrayal of Jill, and was nominated in 1996, 2000, and 2017. She also won the Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in 1991, after a nomination in 1990. Dickson won a Soap Opera Digest Award in 1988 for Outstanding Villainess for the role, and Walton won one for Outstanding Lead Actress in 1994.

Early life Lefferts was born in West Germany, one of five children of Ed, a United States Air Force officer, and Bobbie Lefferts. Lefferts moved to Sacramento, Japan, Topeka, Cape Cod and San Diego before the family settled in the Tampa Bay area. As a child, Lefferts suffered from asthma, was prone to attacks and his parents did not let him play baseball until he was 12 years old. Lefferts received a commission to attend the United States Air Force Academy where he planned to become a pilot like his father. However, he failed the pilot physical due to a lack of depth perception and lazy eye. Lefferts' father wrote to his alma mater, the University of Arizona, and asked if his son could walk on to the school's baseball team. Coach Jerry Kindall added Lefferts to the roster but cut him shortly thereafter as he was undersized (at and ) and did not throw hard. Lefferts eventually worked his way back onto the roster to become one of the team's best pitchers. Lefferts represented the United States at the 1979 Pan American Games. He graduated from the University of Arizona and was the winning pitcher in the 1980 College World Series title game, leading the Arizona Wildcats to a 5-3 victory over the Hawaii Rainbow Warriors. He was named to the 1980 College World Series all-tournament team. He was then drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the ninth round of the 1980 amateur draft. Professional career Lefferts helped the Padres win the 1984 National League pennant and the Giants win the 1987 National League West division title and the 1989 National League pennant. In the winter of 1985 he was offered to the New York Mets in exchange for outfielder Lenny Dykstra, but Mets general manager Frank Cashen declined the offer. The 83 games he pitched in during 1986 not only led the National League but remains a Padres single season record. Lefferts was traded by the Padres to the Orioles for Erik Schullstrom on August 31, 1992 in a transaction which was completed four days later on September 4 when Ricky Guti√©rrez was also sent to San Diego.\\"Orioles Trade for Lefty Lefferts, Give Padres Minor Leaguer, etc.,\\" News & Record (Greensboro, NC), Tuesday, September 1, 1992.

He was the first pitcher to hit a walk- off home run since Moe Drabowsky in 1969.

He was a graduate, and then professor at Harvard University. He is also known for his published works, like the translation of The Odyssey (1884) and others about education and ethics, such as The New Education (1887) and The Glory of the Imperfect (1898). Early life Palmer was born in Boston, Massachusetts on March 9, 1842 to Julius Auboyneau and Lucy Manning Peabody Palmer. He had a brother, Frederic. He attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. In 1864, he graduated at Harvard College with a bachelor's degree and three years later with a master's degree. Between 1867 and 1869, he studied at the University of T√ºbingen, Germany. He graduated from the Andover Theological Seminary in 1870. Career In 1870, Palmer became an instructor of the Greek language. When someone commented that Palmer taught Greek, he said \\"You are mistaken. I do not teach Greek. I teach boys. Greek is what I start with.\\" Between 1872 and 1876, Palmer curated the 'Gray Engravings' (a collection of engravings bequeathed to Harvard College by Francis Calley Gray), which he proposed to have photographed and make generally available the prints \\"to foster the growing taste in the community for the higher forms of Art\\" (thereby serving as a precursor to Harvard's Open Collection Program), as well as that Harvard's \\"students will soon prefer these to the inane works which now decorate too many of their rooms\\". Simultaneously (from 1872) Palmer also taught Philosophy, being elevated to the rank of Assistant Professor in 1873, and Professor in 1883 - a position he held for six years, when he became an Alford Professor of Natural Religion, Moral Philosophy, and Civil Polity at Harvard (a tenure that lasted from 1889 to 1913). Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts about 1910 He said about ethics, \\"Right conduct consists in following one's conscience and doing one's duty for the sake of right and not for any ulterior purpose\\". He wished to, \\"burn the pictures of heaven and quench the fires of hell that men might do right for the sake of the right.\\" It was stated in The Harvard Crimson that he was instrumental in the development of the character of the Philosophy department at Harvard, through his teaching methods and written works. He was particularly interested in classical literature and philosophy, as well as the poet George Herbert. Palmer enjoyed teaching and once said that he would gladly pay Harvard for the right. He was called the \\"Dean of teachers\\" for the manner in which he inspired students to become teachers. Dana-Palmer House, Harvard University Among his books are the translation of The Odyssey, (1884), The New Education (1887), The Glory of the Imperfect (1898), Self-Cultivation in English (1897). He also wrote The Field of Ethics (1901), The Nature of Goodness (1904), The Life and Works of George Herbert (three volumes, 1905), The Teacher (1908), Intimations of Immortality in the Sonnets of Shakespeare (1912), and Trades and Professions (1914). While at Harvard, Professor Palmer lived in Dana- Palmer House, which bears his name. It is also called the Harvard University Guest House. He retired in 1913, but remained active on the campus, such as his popular readings of the classics. Between 1894 and 1909, Palmer received honorary LL.D degrees from the University of Michigan, Union, Dartmouth, and Harvard. He received and honorary Litt.D degree from Western Reserve in 1897. In 1917, he received an honorary degree from the University of California. Personal life Daniel Chester French, Alice Freeman Palmer Memorial, Houghton Chapel, Wellesley College He married his first wife, Ellen Margaret Wellman from Brookline, Massachusetts in 1871 and she died in 1879. On December 23, 1887, he married, as his second wife, Alice Freeman Palmer, who was the president of Wellesley College. They had a \\"marriage of comradeship\\". They both pursued their individual careers, and George contributed efforts to managing the household, particularly when she was at the University of Chicago during her post there as dean of women. He had a home in Boxford, Massachusetts for summer and other vacation trips. Palmer had three sabbaticals, during which they lived in their favorite cities and traveled through the countryside on bicycles. During his third sabbatical, in December 1902, the Palmers were in Paris and Alice required surgery. She died of an abdominal condition now treatable with antibiotics. After her death, he wrote The Life of Alice Freeman Palmer (1908). He died on May 7, 1933 at 91 years of age and his ashes were buried with his wife's at the Houghton Chapel of Wellesley College.

Model 1894-Rifle, made 1896, 24 inch barrel, checked fancy grips and forearm / 1894-Carbine, made 1948 The Winchester Model 1894 rifle (also known as the Winchester 94 or Model 94) is a lever-action repeating rifle that became one of the most famous and popular hunting rifles of all time. It was designed by John Browning in 1894 and originally chambered to fire two metallic black powder cartridges, the .32-40 Winchester and .38-55 Winchester. It was the first rifle to chamber the smokeless powder round, the .30 WCF (Winchester Center Fire, in time becoming known as the .30-30) in 1895. In 1901 Winchester created the new .32 Winchester Special caliber with production of rifles starting in 1902. The 1894 was produced by the Winchester Repeating Arms Company through 1980 and then by U.S. Repeating Arms under the Winchester brand until they ceased manufacturing rifles in 2006. Reproductions are being made by the Miroku company of Japan and imported into the United States by the Browning Arms company of Morgan, Utah. The Model 1894 has been referred to as the \\"ultimate lever-action design\\" by firearms historians such as R. L. Wilson and Hal Herring. The Model 1894 is the rifle credited with the name \\"Winchester\\" being used to refer to all rifles of this type and was the first commercial sporting rifle to sell over 7,000,000 units. One Model 1894 is on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the Arms & Armor department. Overview The Winchester Model 1894 was the first commercial American repeating rifle built to be used with smokeless powder. The 1894 was originally chambered to fire 2 metallic black powder cartridges, the .32-40 Winchester and .38-55 Winchester. In 1895 Winchester went to a different steel composition for rifle manufacturing that could handle higher pressure rounds and offered the rifle in .25-35 Winchester and .30-30 Winchester. The .30-30 Winchester, or .30 WCF (Winchester Centerfire), is the cartridge that has become synonymous with the Model 1894. Starting in 1899, the Model 1894 was also chambered in .32 Winchester Special. The Model 94's combination of potent firepower in a compact, lightweight, comfortable-to-carry, and quick-shooting package has made it an extremely popular hunting rifle, particularly for white-tailed deer in the dense forests of the Eastern United States, where most game is killed at relatively short distances. As a result, it was the first sporting rifle to sell over 7,000,000 units. The millionth Model 1894 was given to President Calvin Coolidge in 1927, the 1¬Ω millionth rifle to President Harry S. Truman on May 8, 1948 and the two millionth unit was given to President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1953. The United States government purchased 1,800 commercial Model 1894s with 50,000 .30-30 cartridges during World War I. These rifles in the 835800 to 852500 serial number range were marked atop the receiver ring with a flaming bomb and \\"U.S.\\" The rifles were intended for United States Army Signal Corps personnel stationed in the Pacific Northwest to prevent labor strike actions from interrupting manufacture of Sitka spruce lumber for framing the fuselage and wings of military aircraft. The rifles were sold as military surplus after the war.Canfield, Bruce N. 19th Century Military Winchesters March 2001 American Rifleman p. 77 To release Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifles for infantry use, the Royal Navy purchased approximately 5,000 .30-30 caliber Model 94 rifles in 1914 for shipboard guard duty and mine-clearing. France purchased 15,100 Model 1894 carbines equipped with sling swivels on the left side of the buttstock and barrel band, and with metric gradations on the No. 44A rear sight. These French carbines were issued to motorcycle couriers, artillery troops, trench railway personnel, and some balloon units. Some of these rifles acquired Belgian proofmarks when sold as surplus through Belgium.Mercaldo, Luke & Vanderlinden, Anthony Winchester Lever-Actions go to War June 2015 American Rifleman pp. 53‚Äì54 Examples captured from the United Kingdom by the Wehrmacht were designated the Gewehr 248(e). The Winchester 1894 was used again in World War II in the hands of the Canadian Pacific Coast Rangers who were issued them to defend the west coast of Canada from Japanese invaders. The Model 94 over its long history included the Winchester Model 55, produced from 1924 through 1932 in a barrel, and the Winchester Model 64, produced from 1933 through 1957 in 20, 24, and barrel lengths.The model number 55 was used twice by Winchester, first as a Model 94 variant introduced in 1924, and, later, as a short-lived single-shot/auto-eject hybrid .22-caliber rifle that self-cocked the bolt each time it was fired). Henshaw (1993) p. 84 From 1964 through 1980, a version of the Model 94 carbine was also sold by Sears as the Ted Williams Model 100, as part of Sears' marketing arrangement with both Winchester and the retired baseball star. In mid-1964, the manufacturing of the 94 was changed in order to make the firearm less expensive to produce. Generally referred to as \\"pre-64\\" models, the earlier versions command a premium price over post-change rifles. The limited number of early-1964 production models produced prior to the changeover are considered quite desirable, as they are considered by many to represent the ending of an era. The Winchester 1894's design allowed the cycling of longer cartridges than the Winchester 1892 carbines could permit. When the lever is pulled down, it brings the bottom of the receiver with it, opening up more space and allowing a longer cartridge to feed without making the receiver longer. The mechanism is complex but very reliable. Complete stripping of the action is a multistage task that must be accomplished in precise sequence. However, it is rarely necessary to completely strip the action. The largest cartridge that the 1894 action can accommodate is the .450 Marlin, which was chambered in some custom rifles and the short-lived Timber Carbine on a beefed-up 1894 \\"big bore\\" receiver. Decades after the Winchester 1892 was phased out, the Winchester 1894 Models were manufactured in typical revolver calibers such as .38 Special/.357 Magnum, .44 Special/.44 Magnum, .45 Colt, .38-40 Winchester, and .44-40 Winchester. Typically, the tube magazine is able to hold 9 to 13 rounds of these handgun calibers. The magazine capacity depends on the length of the barrel, as the under barrel tube magazine typically covers the entire length of the barrel. Handgun calibers are preferred by modern-day Cowboy Action Shooters as it allows one type of ammunition for both rifle and handgun. A typical combination would be an 1873 Colt (Colt Peacemaker or clone) and a Winchester 1894 capable of shooting the same type of ammunition. The 1894 action, designed for smokeless rifle rounds, is much stronger than the action of the Winchesters (Models 1866, 1873, 1876) that were based on Benjamin Henry's toggle-link system, and can easily handle modern high-pressure revolver cartridges such as the .44 Magnum. From 1984 to 1997, the Model 94 angle eject 20\\" barreled carbine and 24\\" barreled XTR rifle were offered in 7-30 Waters (an improved .30-30 case necked down to a 7mm bullet). In 2003, the rifle was offered in .410 shotgun and named the Model 9410. As of 1983, the Winchester 1894 holds the record for best-selling high-powered rifle in U.S. history.Wallack, LR. \\"Sixty Million Guns\\". 1983. In Gun Digest Treasury, Harold A. Murtz, editor, DBI Books. 1994 p. 190 U.S. production ceased in 2006. At the time there were 14 versions of the Model 94 in the Winchester catalog. In 2010 Winchester Repeating Arms reintroduced the model 94 in two Limited Edition models to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Oliver F. Winchester's birth in New England in 1810. Design changes Winchester 94 (1966) .32 Winchester Special Three major changes have been made in the design and construction of the Winchester 1894 since World War II, all tied to major shifts in Winchester's corporate leadership and direction. The first and largest came in 1964, after the 1963 resignation of gun enthusiast John M. Olin from the presidency of the company he founded, Olin Corporation. The second came in 1982, after Olin's 1981 sale of the Winchester factory to its employees, who formed the U.S. Repeating Arms Company (USRAC). The third in 1992, after the 1989 bankruptcy of USRAC and its subsequent purchase by FN Herstal, which sought to market Winchester guns worldwide. = 1964 = Upon Olin's retirement, Olin Corporation's new chief executives sought to maximize company profitability, giving corporate preference to its flourishing chemical business over gun production, which was unprofitable and labor-intensive. As a result, Winchester ceased machining both the receiver and many small parts of the Model 94 out of solid steel billet as of 1964. Sintered steel was used on the receiver, stamped sheet metal for the cartridge lifter, and hollow rather than solid steel roll pins used in the action. While the rifle's function, safety, and accuracy were not adversely affected, the changes‚Äîin particular the sintered receiver, which was as strong as its solid-steel predecessor but which did not respond well to a traditional blued finish‚Äîwere conspicuous and came as Winchester made even more fundamental changes to its flagship Model 70 bolt-action rifle. Taken together, they were seen as a retreat from quality production across the company's whole range, seriously damaging Winchester's reputation for making quality firearms in the process. In response, many sought out rifles made before 1964, (pre '64), which command a markedly higher resale value on the gun market to this day. = 1982 = One of the drawbacks of the original Model 1894 action in relation to competitors like the Marlin Model 336 was that the Winchester ejects cartridges from the top of the receiver and over the user's shoulder, rather than to the side. A top-ejecting firearm cannot mount a telescopic scope on top of the receiver‚Äîthe most convenient location for the shooter‚Äîwithout interfering with cartridge ejection. A scope for such a firearm must instead be mounted either far forward on the barrel (where it must be specifically designed for the purpose), or offset to the side of the gun (which creates problems due to parallax). Both options seriously degrade the usefulness of a scope for such a rifle. This was not a major concern when the gun was originally designed; the most common upgrade to guns of the pre‚ÄìWorld War II era was the installation of a peep sight to the rear of the receiver, which maximized the accuracy potential of the factory-installed iron sights. Winchester had long had mounting holes pre-drilled in the receiver of the gun to accommodate such a modification, and it was by far the most common upgrade installed on the Model 94 for most of its history. Nevertheless, consumer tastes changed in the years after World War II as high quality scopes became both widely available and affordable. Commercial acceptance of the new scopes was likewise rapid, and by the 1970s the ability to use receiver-mounted scopes on hunting rifles had become expected by most gun buyers. With the competition able to mount scopes on its receivers without difficulty, this shortcoming was blamed for falling sales. In response, Winchester changed the design of the action in 1982 to angled cartridge ejection, which ejects fired cartridges at an angle that allows the rifle to function while fitted with a conventional receiver-mounted scope. = 1992 = Despite these changes, U.S. Repeating Arms did not flourish, declaring bankruptcy in 1989. It was subsequently purchased by Belgian arms maker FN Herstal, which set about improving the whole Winchester line, instituting modern CNC methods of production at Winchester's factory while also seeking to expand the sales and marketing of Winchester rifles worldwide. This effort would culminate in two major changes to the gun in 1992: the reintroducing of now-CNC-machined parts and solid pins back into the action, and the elimination of the traditional half-cock safety notch on the hammer in favor of a cross-bolt safety, which enabled the gun to be sold internationally. Though the increase in build quality was noted at the time, it was the conspicuous presence of the new safety that generated the strongest opinions. It was widely reviled by American consumers and gun writers alike as a \\"lawyer\\" safety, who said it detracted from the overall look, feel, and operation of the rifle. FNH and Winchester responded in 2003 by moving the safety to the tang behind the receiver, which largely quelled the controversy. Both the last Model 94s to leave the New Haven factory before American production ceased in 2006 and the new Model 94s produced in Japan since 2010 by Miroku Corp. feature these tang-mounted safeties.

She is best known for her 6-year run as head coach of Penn State, in which she compiled a 92-52 record. Following that, she became the athletics director at the University of Hartford. She was named one of the nation's top 50 women's sports executives by Street and Smith's Sports Business Journal. She has also worked as the associate athletic director at the University of Connecticut. Early years Meiser grew up in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The rowhouse where she lived was adjacent to the athletic field of Stevens Trade School, which gave her the opportunity to play a lot of sports. She played baseball, basketball, and tennis. She partnered with her sister to play doubles tennis for her high school. Meiser attended West Chester University where she graduated, in 1969, with a bachelor's degree in health and physical education. She then went on to Penn State, where she completed a master's degree in education in 1971 and an MBA in 1986. Penn State Meiser was hired to be a basketball coach at Penn State. She was the coach of the Nittany Lions junior varsity basketball team, then became the head coach of the varsity team in 1974.. She served as head coach for six seasons, with a 92‚Äì52 overall record. The team competed in the AIAW post-season tournament each year. In 1974, Meiser offered a scholarship to Mag Strittmatter, the first women's basketball scholarship offered at Penn State. Strittmatter would go on to lead the team in rebounds in each of her four-year, and averaged 10.3 rebounds per game, a school record that still stands. Strittmatter went on to become the executive director of an organization that assists disadvantaged people in Denver. University of Connecticut Meiser joined the athletic department at UConn in 1983, where she would remain for ten years, serving as an associate athletics director for administration and senior women‚Äôs administrator. At the time, the women's basketball team wasn't well-respected, having recently transitioned from a club sport to a varsity sport, but the team had single digit wins in the last four seasons under coach Jean Balthaser, going 9‚Äì18, 9‚Äì20, 9‚Äì18, and 9‚Äì18 between 1981 and 1983, with only a single win in Big East play in 1982‚Äì83. According to Meiser, the school administration wanted to make a change, and believed the women's basketball team could be the \\"vanguard women's sports program at UConn, the kind of program that could move the whole movement for equality forward\\". Meiser chaired the search committee to find a new women's basketball coach, and ended up hiring Geno Auriemma, who has gone on to the lead the team to nine national championships, as of 2014. She would later describe Auriemma as the type of coach who could call on a recruit at her home, and \\"walk out the door with the family's dog in his arms\\". The basketball team did not charge for admission in the early years. Meiser proposed to the Athletic Director Lew Perkins, in 1990 that the team should charge for admission. Although initially skeptical, they tried it, and earned 53 thousand in revenue. It didn't hurt that they chose a year in which the team would be good enough to make it to the Final Four.

After the city's downtown suffered a series of floods, with the worst in 1921,http://drtlibrary.wordpress.com/2010/09/24/san- antonio-flood-of-1921/ plans had been proposed to convert that part of the San Antonio River into a paved-over concrete storm sewer. The San Antonio Conservation Society and other civic groups rallied to oppose the idea. In 1929 Hugman introduced a proposal called, \\"The Shops of Aragon and Romula,‚Äù a beautification and flood-control plan for the heart of the city. He kept the proposal alive for seven years, advocating for his vision with elaborate drawings, in private meetings and public speeches. When private architectural commissions disappeared with the Great Depression, Hugman worked as a planner for public works projects, redesigning Woodlawn Lake, Elmendorf Lake, Concepcion Park, and others, including two new parks in Seguin. His plan for the River Walk was eventually adopted in 1938 when funding became available from the Works Progress Administration. According to biographer Vernon Zunker, Hugman designed 31 unique staircases for the River Walk, along with bridges, water elements, an outdoor theater, and many other features. The bridges were built with high arches to allow gondoliers to pass, as well as floats in the dreamed-for River Parade.http://digital.utsa.edu/cdm/ref/collection/p15125coll4/id/1295, p 12 Hugman's designs included landscaping, showing where every one of 11,000 trees and shrubs were to go among the existing bald cypress and other native trees.http://digital.utsa.edu/cdm/ref/collection/p15125coll4/id/1295 The project had a sad start. Edwin Arneson, the WPA's district director and chief engineer, had been Hugman's boss. He was a powerful and enthusiastic supporter of the River Walk concept who helped get the needed federal funding. But just as things were getting underway, Arneson found that he had terminal cancer. Arneson River Theater is named in his memory for all his work with the WPA, but Arneson never drew a line for any of the River Walk. W.H. Lilly took over as chief engineer and Robert Turk as construction supervisor to finish out the project.oral history interview digital.utsa.edu/cdm/ref/collection/p15125coll4/id/1295, p 9-10 Hugman got into trouble after barely a year, when friction developed with the Mayor, Maury Maverick, who earlier, as Congressman, had been a key supporter of the River Walk. Hugman later said that the mayor pressed him to appoint a relative as 'landscape architect'. He refused, because the salary would be carved out of Hugman's own pay as architect. Meanwhile, Maverick had an adjoining but separate project with the National Youth Administration to restore the historic La Villita neighborhood that bordered part of the river project. When Hugman discovered that material ordered from the River Walk budget was being delivered to La Villita, he rashly took his evidence to confront the River Walk board. The next thing he knew he was fired. Years later in an oral history, Hugman recalled, \\"It was the greatest disappointment of my life\\".http://digital.utsa.edu/cdm/ref/collection/p15125coll4/id/1295, p13 Hugman set up his own architectural office in what had been basement space just as soon the River Walk was completed by the WPA in 1941. Later he laughed to tell of those who said to him, \\"You'll be drowned like a rat in your own hole\\".http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=30606 Today the name \\"Robert H.H. Hugman\\" adorns the river level facade of the Clifford Building at the corner of Commerce Street and South Alamo (next to Casa Rio restaurant, established in 1946). Choosing to locate his office in the old Clifford Building also paid tribute to its designer, J. Riely Gordon, the state's leading architect in his day. After he lost his job with the River Walk, Hugman continued to give his time to the chief engineer, W.H. Lilly, and to Robert Turk, the construction supervisor, to help them follow his plans. But in the years following, Hugman fell into obscurity. He did work for the military, and his private practice included some residences in San Antonio, and Kenedy. From 1957 until 1972 he worked as an architect at Randolph Air Force Base, on the edge of the city. Hugman's reputation began to recover when HemisFair '68, the city's international exposition, brought worldwide attention to the River Walk's unique beauty. Then the bell tower at the Arneson stage was named for him, and in 1978 he was invited to be the first to ring its new bells, just two years before his death. A bridge over the river was named for him, and today several plaques along the River Walk honor his vision as the \\"Father of the River Walk.\\".http://www.thefreelibrary.com/AIA+San+Antonio+Honors+San+Antonio+River+Walk+Visionary+Robert+H.H....-a0145233994 Before his River Walk work, Hugman had also designed the original Walnut Springs Park in nearby Seguin, Texas, which has been partly reworked after years of neglect. Features of that park, such as the stone retaining walls and low dams with stepping stones between the overflowing water, foreshadowed elements seen in the River Walk. Hugman Silber Architects home in Kenedy, TX And Hugman designed Seguin's Max Starcke Park, built by the National Youth Administration and dedicated in 1938‚Äîbefore work began on the River Walk. He was the architect of the handsome Art Deco style Recreation Building there,, showing that he was not limited to the Spanish Colonial Revival style. The park features a remarkable redesign of the old Saffold Dam across the Guadalupe River.

Grandiose, and always ready to raise hostility levels, the malignant narcissist undermines families and organizations in which they are involved, and dehumanizes the people with whom they associate. Malignant narcissism is a hypothetical, experimental diagnostic category. Narcissistic personality disorder is found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR), while malignant narcissism is not. As a hypothetical syndrome, malignant narcissism could include aspects of narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) alongside a mix of antisocial, paranoid and sadistic personality disorder traits. The importance of malignant narcissism and of projection as a defense mechanism has been confirmed in paranoia, as well as \\"the patient's vulnerability to malignant narcissistic regression\\". History The social psychologist Erich Fromm first coined the term \\"malignant narcissism\\" in 1964, describing it as a \\"severe mental sickness\\" representing \\"the quintessence of evil\\". He characterized the condition as \\"the most severe pathology and the root of the most vicious destructiveness and inhumanity\\". Edith Weigert (1967) saw malignant narcissism as a \\"regressive escape from frustration by distortion and denial of reality\\", while Herbert Rosenfeld (1971) described it as \\"a disturbing form of narcissistic personality where grandiosity is built around aggression and the destructive aspects of the self become idealized.\\" On 11 May 1968, psychoanalyst Otto Kernberg presented his paper Factors in the Psychoanalytic Treatment of Narcissistic Personalities, from the work of the Psychotherapy Research Project of The Menninger Foundation, at the 55th Annual Meeting of the American Psychoanalytic Association in Boston. Kernberg's paper was first published in hard copy on 1 January 1970. In Kernberg's 1968 paper, first published in 1970 in the Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association (JAPA), the word 'malignant' does not appear once, while 'pathological' or 'pathologically' appears 25 times. Developing these ideas further, Kernberg pointed out that the antisocial personality was fundamentally narcissistic and without morality. Malignant narcissism includes a sadistic element creating, in essence, a sadistic psychopath. In his article, \\"malignant narcissism\\" and psychopathy are employed interchangeably. Kernberg first proposed malignant narcissism as a psychiatric diagnosis in 1984. So far it has not been accepted in any of the medical manuals, such as the ICD-10 or the DSM-5. Kernberg described malignant narcissism as a syndrome characterized by a narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), antisocial features, paranoid traits, and egosyntonic aggression. Other symptoms may include an absence of conscience, a psychological need for power, and a sense of importance (grandiosity). Psychoanalyst George H. Pollock wrote in 1978: \\"The malignant narcissist is presented as pathologically grandiose, lacking in and behavioral regulation with characteristic demonstrations of joyful cruelty and sadism\\". Of note, M. Scott Peck uses malignant narcissism as a way to explain evil.Peck, M. Scott. (1983, 1988). People of the Lie: The hope for healing human evil. Century Hutchinson. Kernberg believed that malignant narcissism should be considered part of a spectrum of pathological narcissism, which he saw as ranging from Hervey M. Cleckley's antisocial character (what is now referred to as psychopathy or antisocial personality) at the high end of severity, through malignant narcissism, and then to narcissistic personality disorder at the low end. So according to Kernberg's hierarchy, psychopathy trumps malignant narcissism as a more extreme form of pathological narcissism. Malignant narcissism can be distinguished from psychopathy, according to Kernberg, because of the malignant narcissist's capacity to internalize \\"both aggressive and idealized superego precursors, leading to the idealization of the aggressive, sadistic features of the pathological grandiose self of these patients\\". According to Kernberg, the psychopath's paranoid stance against external influences makes him or her unwilling to internalize even the values of the \\"aggressor\\", while malignant narcissists \\"have the capacity to admire powerful people, and can depend on sadistic and powerful but reliable parental images\\". Malignant narcissists, in contrast to psychopaths, are also said to be capable of developing \\"some identification with other powerful idealized figures as part of a cohesive 'gang'...which permits at least some loyalty and good object relations to be internalized\\". \\"Some of them may present rationalized antisocial behavior ‚Äì for example, as leaders of sadistic gangs or terrorist groups...with the capacity for loyalty to their own comrades\\". Psychopathy The terms \\"malignant narcissist\\" and \\"psychopath\\" are sometimes used interchangeably because there is little to clinically separate the two. Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder, malignant narcissism, and psychopathy all display similar traits which are outlined in the Hare Psychopathy Checklist. The test has 20 items scored on a three-point scale, with a rating of 0 if it does not apply at all, 1 if there is a partial match or mixed information, and 2 if there is a reasonably good match. With a maximum score of 40, the cut-off for the label of psychopathy is 30 in the United States and 25 in the United Kingdom. High scores are positively associated with measures of impulsivity and aggression, Machiavellianism, persistent criminal behavior, and negatively associated with measures of empathy and affiliation. Malignant narcissism is highlighted as a key area in the study of mass murder, sexual, and serial murder.  Contrast with narcissism The primary difference between narcissism and malignant narcissism is that malignant narcissism includes comorbid features of other personality disorders, and thus consists of a broader range of symptoms than pathological narcissism (NPD) alone. In malignant narcissism, NPD is accompanied by additional symptoms of antisocial, paranoid and sadistic personality disorders. While a person with NPD will deliberately damage other people in pursuit of their own selfish desires, they may regret and will in some circumstances show remorse for doing so. Because ASPD traits are present in malignant narcissism, the \\"malignant narcissist\\" suffers from a more pervasive lack of empathy than someone with NPD alone and will lack feelings of guilt or remorse for the damage they cause. Since sadism is often considered a feature of malignant narcissism, an individual with the syndrome may not only lack feelings of guilt or remorse for hurting others, but may even derive pleasure from the gratuitous infliction of mental or physical pain on others. These traits were formerly codified in the DSM-III under sadistic personality disorder (SPD). Therapy Typically in the analysis of the malignant narcissist, \\"the patient attempts to triumph over the analyst by destroying the analysis and himself or herself\\"‚Äîan extreme version of what Jacques Lacan described as \\"that resistance of the amour-propre...which is often expressed thus: 'I can't bear the thought of being freed by anyone other than myself'\\".

The character was first introduced in 1980 being portrayed by Terry Lester. Lester departed from the series in 1989 and was replaced by Peter Bergman shortly thereafter. Bergman relocated to California for the role after he successfully auditioned for the part. His first episode aired on November 27, 1989. Jack is known for his longstanding feud with the Newman family patriarch, Victor Newman as well as his romances with Nikki Newman, Phyllis Summers and Sharon Newman. Jack has represented the Abbott family as the patriarch since the 2006 passing of his father, John Abbott. Casting The role of Jack Abbott was first written into the series on July 22, 1980, being portrayed by Terry Lester. In May 1985, it was announced that Lester would be leaving the role; he stated that it was because of a CBS film (Blade) he starred in which could have possibly become a series: \\"I wanted to work something out. I've enjoyed being with the show. However, I was concerned about the possibility of Blade being picked up as a series and being tied to The Young and the Restless.\\" However, he ended up staying. Brett Porter briefly portrayed the role in 1986. The writers picked up on Lester having \\"played with Jack's dialogue\\" according to his intuitions. In 1989, Lester quit out of anger, as he felt that Jack was being \\"squeezed\\" out of the storyline, and was upset that Lauralee Bell's character Christine Blair was moved to the forefront of several storylines. Lester made his last appearance on September 1, 1989. The producers immediately began exploring recast options. At the time, Bergman, who had rose to super stardom as Dr. Cliff Warner on All My Children, had recently been fired. Bergman's firing made headlines, and Melody Thomas Scott, who portrays Nikki Newman, suggested Bergman as Jack to her husband and former executive producer Edward J. Scott when she read of the news in Soap Opera Digest. Bergman revealed that the producers had contacted his agent and asked about his height; he initially thought it was a joke. They then inquired about Bergman's feelings about replacing someone, and he was hesitant to take the role. He stated in 2009: \\"I was on All My Children and replacing someone was sheer death, and it never worked on All My Children.\\" When the producers called him again, he decided it \\"couldn't hurt\\" to audition. Scott arranged for Bergman to come to California and audition with Jerry Douglas and Jess Walton, who portrayed John and Jill Abbott respectively. After a successful audition, Bergman was offered the part. Bergman reluctantly relocated to California after accepting the part. He made his debut on November 27, 1989. Other actors were considered for the role, including Jon Lindstrom, who screen tested for William J. Bell, which was later broadcast on an episode of 48 Hours. In 1997, Bergman appeared as Jack on an episode of the popular CBS series The Nanny entitled \\"The Heather Biblow Story\\". In the episode, he shared an onscreen kiss with fellow guest star Pamela Anderson. Bergman also guest starred as Jack on another of the network's comedy series' The King of Queens; he appeared in the episode \\"Inner Tube\\" along with fellow cast members Melody Thomas Scott and Scott Reeves (who portrayed Ryan McNeil). In 2006, Bergman stated: \\"I love what I do! I get a new script every day, and I can't wait to find out what happens next. I've been doing this for 18 years, and I still can't wait to see what Jack has in store for us next.\\" Development =Characterization= While he was in the role, Lester stated that Jack was a villain, but not entirely: \\"I think Jack has changed in the past four years, although there's a tendency to make him the same old circus villain he was in the beginning. Happily the producers, the writers and myself were able to keep Jack progressing - never a wonderful person, but not nasty just to be nasty.\\" Of the character, Bergman stated that: \\"Jack goes from tender, loving scenes at the beginning of an episode with Nikki, where he's so pathetic and loving and sincere, to taking someone's head off by Act 5. Jack is mercurial that way. He can be in a perfectly good mood and you scuff his shoe and he wants to kill you. I don't have any problems supporting that with real emotions.\\" According to Bergman, \\"Jack is not annoyed by the 'little people' ever.\\" Though Jack is a villain, Bergman \\"wanted Jack to have Achilles heels.\\" Jack spends majority of his life longing for \\"a solid happy family.\\" Bergman's first lines as Jack on the show were \\"Smiling Jack is back. No more Mr. nice guy.\\" Jack has always had trouble finding and keeping the right woman. When compared to his former alter ego Cliff Warner, Bergman explained: \\"It is quite the contrast, the guy who found his one true love, followed by the most unlucky-in-love guy out there, someone who can't seem to hold on to it. Love is just out of his grasp.\\" During his 20th anniversary reflection, Bergman described Jack as \\"a reckless, selfish, uncaring cad\\" changed by love. Jack's playboy issues stem from missing his mother. His unfaithfulness was a way of unconsciously punishing all women for his mother abandoning him. For Bergman's portrayal of Jack, Mamie Johnson (Veronica Redd) is his \\"Achilles heel\\". Mamie is the woman who has been around since he was a child, even when his mother isn't. Jack cannot get anything past Mamie; Bergman said that she \\"saw right through him\\". However, John fills the role of father and mother for Jack which makes him a \\"therefore larger than life figure in Jack's life.\\" Bergman described John as Jack's \\"rudder\\" or \\"consciousness.\\" So when John dies, Jack feels alone. Soon after, Jack begins seeing John's ghost. According to Bergman, Jack is \\"so desperate to keep his dead dad around, he keeps conjuring him up!\\" =Relationships= Bergman stated that Jack's three most significant romances with Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott), Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford) and Sharon Newman (Sharon Case) helped to reform him. Jack goes after Nikki initially for business and revenge. He intends to get Nikki to fall for him and then use her to get Jabot Cosmetics back from Victor. Jack's plan to bargain for the company by using Nikki backfires when he falls for her. Jack falls hard and is at \\"his most vulnerable\\" with Nikki. Though quite a few women fall victim to Jack's philandering ways, Nikki forgives him. When they lose their son in March 1993, Bergman said that, \\"Jack learned empathy for the first time in his life.\\" Jack usually has a lot of control over his life, but he cannot save Nikki from her addiction; in fact, he makes it worse. By the time the relationship does fall apart, \\"[Jack] is still a cad, but not as bad as before.\\" Jack has a long- standing relationship with Phyllis Summers. Bergman described Jack and Phyllis's pairing as one of his \\"least likely pairings\\", stating that Jack and Phyllis are the complete \\"opposite of star-crossed\\". Despite divorcing after only three years, the couple remains close. Phyllis ends up having an affair with Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow), resulting in a pregnancy. Bergman said that, \\"It truly hurts him. He's in pain\\" when he sees Phyllis pregnant. Following Phyllis's betrayal, Bergman felt Jack changes again, \\"in a big way\\", and that he becomes very \\"complex\\". Jack then begins a romance with Nick's ex- wife, Sharon Newman, who was also hurt by the affair. Of the decision to pair the characters, Bergman said that it may have been an \\"ill-conceived last resort\\" after the Phyllis and Nick pairing. The co-stars decided to make the relationship work. Bergman revealed that he and Case made the \\"concerted effort to turn this relationship into something\\". Of the relationship, Bergman said: \\"It is only appropriate that Jack and Sharon found each other. Wherever Sharon goes, she is embarrassed. Will Phyllis come walking around the corner? But Sharon doesn't have any reason to be embarrassed with Jack.\\" However, Bergman also noted that his intimacy with Sharon \\"all happens so quickly. Jack is doing something manipulative.\\" He also noted that Jack is attracted to Sharon's \\"simple honesty\\". The only thing Sharon wants in return is honesty, and Jack cannot give it to her. Sharon is the closest Jack's ever come to having a solid family unit. Though the relationship only last three and half years, Sharon is there for Jack during the death of his father and his niece, Colleen (Tammin Sursok). Jack has had other various romances. In 1994, Jack became romantically involved with newly introduced character Mari Jo Mason (Diana Barton), after a \\"year of going\\" it solo without a love interest. Nancy Reichardt of The Tuscaloosa News noted that Jack was back \\"romantically speaking\\", finding love again. However, Mari had a hidden past; a relationship with Blade Bladeson (Michael Tylo), who was married to his sister Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson). Bergman said he was \\"having fun\\" playing out the storyline, but speaking of Mari, he said: \\"I u√≠k quite make out whether she's a big event in Jack's life or a big event in Blade Bladeson's life ... I certainly love the idea that it's a convoluted a story as it is.\\" Bergman said that he is happy that Jack is \\"feeling saucy again\\", stating: \\"I like Jack being on the prowl. I like the energy Jack gets to play. It's different from what I've been playing for some time.\\" Of working with a newly cast soap opera actress, Bergman said it could be difficult working with someone lacking \\"technical experience\\" but at the same time, praised Barton's work. The romance failed. =Rivalries= Following a 2006 storyline which saw the Abbott children team up against their late father's wife Gloria Fisher (Judith Chapman), Bergman said: \\"It's almost laughable that anyone feels sorry for Gloria.\\" He said that \\"a woman died possibly because of her malfeasance (Gloria tainted Ashley's skin cream sample), and we're feeling sorry for her? Not to mention how she changed the last part of John's life: He spent the last month of his life in prison.\\" Bergman, however, stated that Jack changed after his father's passing; all he wanted was to regain the family company, Jabot Cosmetics and would do anything good or bad to get it. Bergman said: \\"Jack changed at the funeral. A switch changed immutably the day John died. John was Jack's moral compass. Now he's not encumbered by that course of right and wrong. There are not too many places he won't go to protect his family.\\" =Doppelg√§nger= In April 2015, it is revealed that there are two Jacks, one being Jack himself and another being a doppelg√§nger hired by Victor. On-Air On-Soaps noted that there was much speculation leading up to the reveal, observing that \\"Many in the audience guessed it\\". Bergman took on dual roles, the first time he had done this in his career. The actor said that he was \\"having a ball\\" playing two characters, saying: \\"The challenge is to make it entertaining and the best way to do that is to make a lot of it funny, and we do.\\" Luke Kerr of Daytime Confidential wrote: \\"[Victor] went shopping at Moguls-R-Us and came home with a shiny, new Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman) doppelganger, whom he's unleashed on Genoa City.\\" Little is known about Fake Jack upon his introduction to the soap opera, apart from the fact that he was found by Victor in a Peruvian prison, although Bergman speculated that the character \\"is quite literally a doppelg√§nger, that lookalike we all supposedly have walking around on the planet somewhere\\". The character is described as a \\"loose cannon\\". Bergman also told TV Insider that Fake Jack \\"likes to wear bright stuff. [Laughs] I've been having a ball with the people in the wardrobe department!\\" Storylines =Backstory= John Abbott, Jr. known commonly as Jack, is born on June 29 (in 1953 or 1954) to Dina Abbott. and John Abbott . He has two younger sisters, Ashley and Traci. Dina walks out on the family when Jack is only thirteen. John is left to raise their children on his own with assistance from housekeeper and nanny, Mamie Johnson (Marguerite Ray, and Veronica Redd). At the age of 19, Jack travels to Vietnam to serve in the army where he falls in love with a young Vietnamese woman known as Mai Yun. At war's end, Jack is forced to evacuate Mai Yun's village and loses contact with his soul mate. After graduating from college, Jack attends Harvard Business School where he becomes captain of the debate team. Jack graduates with an MBA and also gains the reputation of a playboy. =1980‚Äìpresent= In the early 1980s, Jack begins working alongside Jill Foster, who is dating his father John. When John ends the relationship, Jill begins dating Jack. This causes tension between all three of them, and Jill and Jack split up as well. Jill files a sexual harassment suit against Jack and wins $10,000. By 1982, Jill and John reunite and get married. Shortly thereafter, Jack marries Patty Williams in an effort to convince his father to make him president of Jabot. However, Jack begins an affair with Jabot model Diane Jenkins. Diane continuously threatens to tell Patty about the affair to get her way. Once upset with Jack, Diane arranges to have Patty walk in on her and Jack sleeping together, and in the process causes Patty to miscarry her baby.

Reception  Bergman said that his initial casting was met with criticism when compared to his portrayal of the \\"nice guy\\" Cliff Warner on All My Children. Bergman however was able to win over majority of Lester's fans within the first six months of his tenure. He stated: \\"The All My Children fans were the hardest ones to win over because Cliff was such a nice character.\\" Marla Hart of the Chicago Tribune noted that since joining the soap opera, \\"Bergman has traded on his pretty-boy image to underscore Jack's less savory side.\\" Jamaica Gleaner news wrote: \\"It's Jack's humanity that keeps him from being just plain bad. Jack is the anti-hero that you just can't help but root for, especially when viewers get to glimpse Jack's vulnerability.\\" On Jack's rivalry with Victor Newman (Eric Braeden), Allison Waldman of AOL TV said: \\"After all, their characters' on screen feud has been the stuff of soap legend. Victor and Jack have shared wives, corporations, but mostly, unabashed hatred. They despise each other.\\" In July 2020, Bergman's casting was cited as the best all-time recast on a soap opera, by Soaps.com. Bergman has been nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series 16 times from 1990 to 2002, 2007 to 2008, and most recently again in 2010 winning four awards overall in 1991, 1992 and 2002.

The song begins with the sound of an air conditioner being switched on, recorded by assistant engineer Mike Thorne. Roger Glover suggested to engineer Martin Birch that the sound of a machine starting up would be a good way to begin both the song and the album, but Birch could not think of anything available that would fit the purpose.

A promo clip was made for the song, consisting of the band miming to the studio recording in front of a dancing audience. The notes Jon Lord is seen playing do not correspond to the music, and Ritchie Blackmore plays his guitar with the back facing out. Unusually for Deep Purple, the song does not contain a guitar solo. Instead, a bass solo played by Roger Glover is followed by a Jon Lord organ solo. \\"Fireball (Take 1 - Instrumental)\\", a bonus track on the remastered album, features a guitar solo near the end, after the fade-out of the original version. It is one of the few Deep Purple songs to feature Ian Paice using double bass drums. When performed live, before double pedals were available, a second bass drum was added to Paice's drum kit by a stagehand, and removed after the song's conclusion.

It has its roots in the pre-Tridentine Mass as revised by Martin Luther in his Formula missae (\\"Form of the Mass\\") of 1523 and his Deutsche Messe (\\"German Mass\\") of 1526. It was further developed through the Kirchenordnungen (\\"church orders\\") of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries that followed in Luther's tradition. The term \\"Divine Service\\" is popularly used among the more conservative Lutheran churches and organizations of the United States and Canada. In the more progressive denominations, such as The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the terms \\"Holy Communion\\" or \\"the Eucharist\\" are much more commonly used. Other Lutheran rites are also in use, such as those used in the Byzantine Rite Lutheran Churches, such as the Ukrainian Lutheran Church and Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Slovenia. In these Churches, the term \\"Divine Liturgy\\" is used. Definition and origins In the parts of North American Lutheranism that use it, the term \\"Divine Service\\" supplants more usual English-speaking Lutheran names for the Mass: \\"The Service\\" or \\"The Holy Communion.\\" The term is a calque of the German word Gottesdienst (literally \\"God-service\\" or \\"service of God\\"), the standard German word for worship. As in the English phrase \\"service of God,\\" the genitive in \\"Gottesdienst\\" is arguably ambiguous. It can be read as an objective genitive (service rendered to God) or a subjective genitive (God's \\"service\\" to people). While the objective genitive is etymologically more plausible, Lutheran writers frequently highlight the ambiguity and emphasize the subjective genitive.See, e.g., John T. Pless, \\"Six Theses on Liturgy and Evangelism,\\" (Conference on Liturgy and Outreach, Concordia College, 1987) (\\"[I]n worship God is at work to serve His people with His Word and Sacraments. Evangelical worship is Gottesdienst (subjective genitive), Divine service.\\"). This is felt to reflect the belief, based on Lutheran doctrine regarding justification, that the main actor in the Divine Service is God himself and not man, and that in the most important aspect of evangelical worship God is the subject and we are the objects: that the Word and Sacrament are gifts that God gives to his people in their worship. Although the term Mass was used by early Lutherans (the Augsburg Confession states that \\"we do not abolish the Mass but religiously keep and defend it\\"Article 24 of the Augsburg Confession) and Luther's two chief orders of worship are entitled \\"Formula Missae\\" and \\"Deutsche Messe\\"‚Äîsuch use has decreased in English usage except among Evangelical Catholics and \\"High Church Lutherans\\". Also, Lutherans have historically used the terms \\"Gottesdienst\\" or \\"The Service\\" to distinguish their Service from the worship of other protestants, which has been viewed as focusing more on the faithful bringing praise and thanksgiving to God. =United States= The Lutheran liturgy currently used in the United States traces its development back to the work of Beale M. Schmucker, George Wenner and Edward Horn. Their work took place in the context of a wider North American confessional revival. Between 1876 and 1883, various Lutheran synods expressed an interest in creating a common worship service. This led to the creation of a Joint Committee in 1884 which included representatives of the General Synod and General Council, the two dominant pan-Lutheran groups. This committee appointed Schmucker, Wenner and Horn who began their work in April 1884. A year later, they brought a draft to the General Synod's convention which modified and approved the following order: Introit, Kyrie, Gloria in Excelsis, Collect, Epistle, Alleluia, Gospel, Creed, Sermon, General Prayer, Preface, Sanctus and Hosanna, Exhortation to Communicants, Lord‚Äôs Prayer and Words of Institution, Agnus Dei, Distribution, Collect of Thanksgiving, Benediction. In 1887, the three men presented their final draft to the Joint Committee. This final draft used the King James Version language and Anglican (Book of Common Prayer) translations of the Kyrie, Gloria, Creeds, Prefaces, Lord‚Äôs Prayer, and Collects. It also included the Nunc Dimittis as an option. The final draft, with minor edits, was approved by the various synods in 1888 and has become known as The Common Service and formed the basis for every major Lutheran hymnal and worship book into the late twentieth century.The History of the Common ServiceThe Common Service: 1888-1988 Liturgy =Preparatory Service= *Processional hymn is sung. **The people stand. During this hymn, the pastor and those assisting him (such as the acolytes) process into the sanctuary from the narthex.Processional Cross from LCMS.org. *The Invocation begins the Divine Service. **For the Invocation and the Preparatory Service, the pastor is to stand at the foot of the altar steps, advancing to the altar at the Introit.The Conduct of the Service by the Rev. Dr. Arthur Carl Piepkorn He speaks the Trinitarian formula, as the Sign of the Cross is made by all. *The Confession follows **\\"In the Confession (Lat. \\"Confiteor\\"), we kneel humbly before our God, acknowledging our sin and seeking purification of our Spirit. In the Declaration of Grace that follows, we receive from God Himself the assurance of God's mercy and grace that enables us to focus on our loving God.\\"How Lutherans Worship , Lutherans Online. Both the congregation and the pastor kneel as the following is said: > Pastor: If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not > in us. Congregation: But if we confess our sins, God who is faithful and > just will forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. (moment > of silence for personal examination) Pastor: Let us then confess our sins to > God our Father. All: Most merciful God, we confess that we are by nature > sinful and unclean. We have sinned against you in thought, word, and deed, > by what we have done and by what we have left undone. We have not loved You > with our whole heart; we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves. We > justly deserve Your present and eternal punishment. For the sake of Your > Son, Jesus Christ, have mercy on us. Forgive us, renew us, and lead us, so > that we may delight in Your will and walk in Your ways to the glory of your > Holy Name. Amen. Pastor: Almighty God in His mercy has given His Son to die > for you and for His sake forgives you all your sins. As a called and > ordained servant of Christ, and by His authority, I therefore forgive you > all your sins in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy > Spirit. .(Lutheran Service Book, Divine Service I) All: Amen. =Service of the Word= Martin Luther celebrating the Divine Service (predella of the 1547 altar by Lucas Cranach the Elder and Younger in St. Mary's Church, Wittenberg, Germany). *The Introit is sung. **\\"The Introit (Lat. \\"entrance\\") marks the actual beginning of the Service of the Day. It strikes the keynote theme of the entire Service, recognizing the glory of God and announcing God's grace using pertinent verses, usually from the Psalms. The Introit consists of an Antiphon, followed by a Psalm verse, followed by the Gloria Patri. The Antiphon is then repeated for emphasis.\\" It is during the Introit that the choir, ministers (bishop, pastors (presbyters), deacons), and celebrant process to the chancel. Bowing to the altar, they move to their seats. The celebrant approaches the altar and bow to kiss it. All remain standing. *The Kyrie is chanted by a deacon. **\\"In the K√Ωrie El√©ison (Gr. \\"O Lord, have mercy\\"), we pray to God for grace and help in time of need. It expresses our humility and appreciation of our own weakness and need in a sinful world.\\" *The Gloria in Excelsis Deo follows. **\\"The Gloria in Excelsis (Lat. \\"Glory to God in the highest\\") is the angelic hymn announcing the birth of our Savior Jesus Christ to the shepherds. In it, we join in the hymn of the angels in celebration of the Father's gift of His Son.\\" During Advent and Lent the Gloria in Excelsis is omitted. In its place in Advent, \\"O come, O come, Emmanuel\\" is commonly sung. In Lent, \\"Vexilla Regis\\" commonly takes its place. *Next is the Dominus Vobiscum and the day's Collect. **\\"The Dominus Vobiscum is a reciprocal chanted prayer of the Pastor for his people and of the congregation for its Pastor before we together offer our petitions to God. It reflects the special relationship of love between the Pastor and congregation... The Collect sums up, or \\"collects\\", all the prayers of the church into one short prayer and suggests the theme of the day or season.\\" After the collect, all may be seated. *The first reading (commonly an Old Testament passage) is read. **During Easter and its season a passage from the book of Acts of the Apostles is read. After the reading the person chants \\"The Word of the Lord\\", to which the congregation replies \\"Thanks be to God\\". Today the common practice is that the readings (excluding the Gospel) are read by lay people. *Next, the Gradual is sung by the cantor and/or choir. **\\"The Gradual, so-named because it was originally sung from a step (Lat. \\"gradus\\") of the altar, provides a musical echo to the passage just read and a transition to the next lesson.\\" The gradual is psalm that is sung in meditation on the first reading. *The Epistle reading is announced and read. **\\"The Epistle (Gr. \\"letter\\") is usually taken from the letters of the Apostles. Frequently, this lesson does not relate directly to the Gospel. Usually, it bears practical and serious thoughts for daily living.\\" *The Alleluia and verse is now sung by cantor and people. **\\"The Alleluia (Heb. \\"Praise the Lord\\") is a song of joy at the hearing of the Word of God. The accompanying verse usually reflects the mood of the day.\\" During Lent, the Alleluia is omitted and is replaced with a tract. All rise at the singing of the Alleluia and remain standing while the Gospel is read. *The Gospel reading is chanted or spoken. Traditionally the role of a deacon. **\\"At the announcement of the Gospel, we sing the Gloria Tibi, Domine (Lat. \\"Glory to you, O Lord\\"), joyfully affirming our recognition of the real presence of Christ. After hearing our Savior's Good News, we respond with words of praise in the Laus Tibi, Christe (Lat. \\"Praise to you, O Christ\\").\\" *The Hymn of the day is sung next. **This hymn outlines the theme of the day and is the chief hymn of the Divine Service, so it is chosen very carefully. Following, the people may be seated. *Sermon (also called \\"homily\\" or \\"postil\\"). **\\"In the Sermon, the preacher \\"rightly divides (or interprets) the Word of truth.2 Timothy 2:15.\\" The Sermon contains elements of the two great doctrines of the Bible: the Law, which tells us how we are to live, and the Gospel, which proclaims forgiveness of our sins, by grace, through faith, for Christ's sake. The Gospel predominates in the Sermon. The Sermon usually relates to the lessons of the day.\\" After the sermon the people stand and the pastor says the Votum (Lat. \\"we desire\\"): \\"The peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.\\" *The Nicene Creed is spoken. **\\"The Creed (Lat. \\"I believe\\") is our individual, public confession of faith, spoken with the \\"one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church\\". It is a statement of Christianity's most basic and fundamental beliefs, witnessing to the unity and universality of the Church. It does not specifically mean \\"The Roman Catholic Church\\" *The Collection and Offertory follow. **After the offerings have been collected they are given to the pastor, who presents it at the altar. \\"We joyfully offer to God a portion of His gifts to us, as an outward response of our faith in Him.\\" After the collection, the Offertory is sung. \\"In the words of David, we ask God to cleanse our hearts, to keep us in the one true faith and to grant us the full joy of salvation.\\" *The Prayer of the Faithful is next, with petitions offered by a deacon. **\\"In the Prayer of the Faithful, the Church performs its priestly role (which is communal and not individual) by representing the people of the world before God in prayer. The \\"Prayer of the Church\\" is therefore not the prayer of individuals for themselves nor the congregation for itself but is indeed the prayer of the Church for the world, the work of the Church, and the Church itself.\\" =Service of the Sacrament= *The Preface is chanted. **\\"The Preface begins the Office of Holy Communion. It begins with a simple but powerful dialogue between the pastor and the congregation, which unites the whole body of believers in reverence, adoration, joy and thanksgiving in anticipation of the Sacrament. This is followed by the Common Preface, which begins \\"It is truly good, right and salutary\\" and ends with \\"Therefore with angels and archangels,\\" thus uniting the Church with angelic host. In between is the Proper Preface, which is variable.\\" *The Sanctus is sung. **\\"In the Sanctus (Lat. \\"Holy\\"), we join with the \\"Angels, Archangels and all the company of heaven\\" in proclaiming the glory of the Father (first sentence), praising Christ our Savior (second sentence) and singing the song of the children of Jerusalem as they welcomed the Messiah on the first Palm Sunday (third sentence).\\" *The Anaphora follows. **\\"The reverent, unadorned use of the Anaphora focuses all our thoughts on the acts and words or Christ and expresses the Real Presence of Christ's body and blood in, with and under the bread and wine. Here, God is dealing with us in a loving manner, reminding us that Christ died for our sins.\\" Below is an example form:(Lutheran Service Book, Divine Service I,III, Lutheran Book of Worship) > Pastor: You are indeed holy, almighty and merciful God; you are most holy, > and great is the majesty of your glory. You so loved the world that you gave > your only Son, that whoever believes in him may not perish but have eternal > life. Having come into the world, he fulfilled for us your holy will and > accomplished our salvation. Our Lord Jesus Christ, on the night when He was > betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it > to his disciples and said, 'Take; eat; this is my body, given for you. This > do in remembrance of me.' In the same way, also, He took the cup after > supper, and when He had given thanks, He gave it to them saying, 'Drink of > it all of you. This cup is the New Testament in My Blood, shed for you for > the forgiveness of sins. This do as often as you drink it, in remembrance of > Me.'

People: Amen. Pastor: > As often as we eat this bread and drink this cup, we proclaim the Lord's > death until He comes. People: Amen. Come, Lord Jesus. Pastor: O Lord Jesus > Christ, only Son of the Father, in giving us Your body and blood to eat and > to drink, You lead us to remember and confess Your holy cross and passion, > Your blessed death, Your rest in the tomb, Your resurrection from the dead, > Your ascension into heaven, and Your coming for the final judgment. * Many > Lutheran churches forego the use of a eucharistic prayer which encircle > Jesus' words of institution and instead progress from the Sanctus to the > Words of Institution to the Lord's Prayer to the Agnus Dei and on to the > distribution. Widely respected Lutheran liturgical scholar and theologian > Oliver K. Olson wrote; \\"The danger of the eucharistic prayer is not > primarily its text, but its direction.\\" and \\"Including human words in the > consecration means enclosing the words of institution (like a sandwich) > within a human prayer. Making the words of institution into part of a prayer > results in a change of direction. That means that the liturgy is initiated > by humans and directed toward God.\\" The danger of this mistaken direction of > the action at this point of the service is that Lutherans are unanimous in > the belief that the Lord's Supper is solely God's service to us and the use > of the eucharistic prayer may lead to an unintended teaching of it being a > human action toward God that results in its efficacy rather than it being > merely our Holy Spirit given faith that clings to Christ's promised, \\"for > you\\". *The Lord's Prayer follows. **\\"As children, we address our God as \\"Our Father\\", praying as our Lord Jesus Christ himself taught us to pray.\\" *Next is the Pax Domini. **\\"The Pax Domini (Lat. \\"Peace of the Lord\\") is the same greeting spoken by the risen Christ to His disciples on Easter evening.Luke 24:36 and John 20:19 It is the final blessing before we approach the altar to receive the gift of Christ's body and blood.\\" *The Agnus Dei follows. **\\"The Agnus Dei (Lat. \\"Lamb of God\\") is our hymn of adoration to our Savior Jesus Christ who is truly present for us in the Sacrament. The Agnus Dei recalls the testimony of John the Baptist when he pointed to Jesus and proclaimed: \\"Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.\\"\\" *The Distribution is next. **The congregation is to remain kneeling in adoration during the distribution. The pastor first receives communion and then \\"those who will be assisting him\\".Lutheran Worship, Divine Service I \\"By Christ's own words, \\"Given and shed for you for the remission of sins\\", in the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper God offers, gives, and seals for us forgiveness of sins, life and salvation.\\" The manner of receiving the Eucharist differs throughout the world. Sometimes there is a cushioned area at the front of the church where the congregation can come to the front to kneel and receive this sacrament. Typically, the pastor distributes the host and an assistant (the deacon) then distributes the wine. The congregation departs and may make the sign of the cross. In other Lutheran churches, the process is much like the Post-Vatican II form used in the Catholic Church,Catholic Communion process from the Roman Rite Mass the eucharistic minister (most commonly the pastor) and his assistants/deacons line up, with the eucharistic minister in the center, holding the hosts, and the two assistants on either side, holding the chalices. The people process to the front in lines and receive the Eucharist standing When a person receives the bread, the eucharistic minister may say \\"The Body of Christ, given for you.\\" When a person receives the wine, the assistant/deacon may say \\"The Blood of Christ, shed for you.\\" Following this, the people make the sign of the cross (if they choose to) and return to their places in the congregation. In dismissing the communicants, the pastor commonly says, \\"The body and blood of our Lord strengthen and preserve you steadfast in the true faith to life everlasting.\\" The communicants may say \\"Amen\\". Silent prayer is appropriate after being dismissed. \\"The Dismissal reassures communicants of the efficacy of the Lord's Supper in creating life-saving faith in Christ.\\" *The nunc dimittis is sung next as a postcommunion canticle **\\"In singing the Nunc Dimittis, (Lat. \\"Now you dismiss\\"), we stand with Simeon as he looked upon the baby Jesus, in awe of the profound mystery that the Father would give His only Son in the flesh for the salvation of our souls. Having just received the Lord's Supper, we have truly seen Thy Salvation, which [God] prepared before the face of all people.\\" *The postcommunion collect follows. **\\"The Versicle calls us to give thanks and introduces the Thanksgiving Collect. In the Collect, we thank God for His life-saving Sacrament and pray that His gift of faith offered therein causes us to change our life and enables us to love God and love others.\\" *The Benediction (from Numbers 6:24) and the Amen is chanted. **\\"More than a prayer for blessing, the Benediction imparts a blessing in God's name, giving positive assurance of the grace and peace of God to all who receive it in faith. The words of the Benediction are those that the God gave to Moses (the Aaronic Blessing) and those used by Christ at the Ascension. The final word that falls on our ears from our gracious God is \\"peace\\", affirming our reconciliation to God through the blood of Jesus Christ... We conclude the Divine Service with a triple Amen, that is, \\"Yea, yea, it shall be so\\", which expresses our firm faith in the forgiveness of sins by God's grace through Jesus Christ as heard and experienced in the Word and Sacrament of the Divine Service just ended.\\" *The recessional hymn is sung. **The pastor and his assistants process into the narthex. *The ite missa est concludes the Divine Service. **Before the congregation departs, the deacon walks back into the sanctuary and says, \\"Go in peace to love and serve the Lord\\" (or similar words) as the people respond, \\"Thanks be to God.\\" Gallery Image:EucharistELCA.JPGCommunion setting at an Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) worship service.

Port Germein was named after Samuel Germein, who moved into the territory in 1840, although some credit his brother John to be the first European to traverse the area. The township was proclaimed in 1878. Port Germein's population in the was 249. History Port Germein was once an important transport hub for the surrounding districts following the opening of its jetty in 1881 ‚Äì at the time known as the longest jetty in the Southern Hemisphere. Due to the shallow water along the coast, the long jetty was built to allow sailing ships to be loaded with grain from surrounding districts. Bagged wheat came from the local area, the eastern side of the Southern Flinders Ranges via Port Germein Gorge (opened in 1879), and from the west coast in smaller boats. About 100,000 bags of wheat were loaded per year. The jetty was extended to its full length of 1680m in 1883.The Port Germein Jetty Tramway Eardley, Gifford Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, February 1974 pp44-47 With the opening of the port came an influx of workers from Adelaide, and by 1900 the town's population had grown to over 300. Use of the port declined when rail was extended to Port Germein in 1934, and the jetty was later reduced to its present length of 1532m due to storm damage. The historic Port Germein Jetty Site is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register. It formerly had its own municipality, the District Council of Port Germein; since 1980, it has been part of the District Council of Mount Remarkable. Transport The Augusta Highway and the Adelaide-Port Augusta railway line both pass the east side of the township. The railway line has an 1800m passing loop and a goods siding was commissioned in 2015 and is operated by SCT Logistics.  Lighthouse  A lighthouse was erected at the end of the jetty in 1894, replacing the Port Germein Lightship. The lighthouse was manned until July 1917, when it was replaced by an AGA flashing light. The lighthouse was re-established at its current site in 1975.  Pier  The pier had a narrow-gauge railway line extending into the township.

History The Emporium was a department store founded in 1896 in San Francisco by Adolph Feist as a co-operative of individually owned shops in a building owned by the Parrott estate. Then in 1897, through the efforts of Frederick W. Dohrmann, a German immigrant who arrived in California in the 1860s and had made a reputation in the general merchandise and flour milling industries in the Bay Area, a merger was orchestrated with the Golden Rule Bazaar, founded in the 1870s by the Davis Brothers. In 1898, Dohrmann's son, A. B. C. Dohrman, became officially involved in day-to-day affairs and along with others was instrumental in the reorganization of the new Emporium; he was president of the company at the time of the elder Dorhmann's death in 1914. In 1927, the Emporium merged with the Oakland-based department store H.C. Capwell, forming a new holding company, Emporium-Capwell Co., but retaining their respective identities. Link via ProQuest. Alternate Link via ProQuest. (Capwell founded his Oakland store in 1889 under the name The Lace House and changed it to his own name two years later.) In the years after World War II, as the population of the Bay Area increased tremendously and spread out far beyond the urban cores of Oakland and San Francisco, several suburban branches of The Emporium were opened in newly developed shopping malls, mainly in San Mateo, Marin, Solano, Sonoma and Santa Clara counties. Capwell's focused its postwar suburban expansion closer to Oakland, opening branch stores in southern Alameda County and Contra Costa County. Broadway- Hale Stores, later Carter Hawley Hale Stores, acquired Emporium-Capwell Co. in 1970, Alternate Link via ProQuest. Alternate Link via ProQuest. and consolidated its San Francisco Bay Area operation under the (still separate) Emporium and Capwell names, finally merging them in 1980 under the Emporium- Capwell name, Link via ProQuest. Alternate Link via ProQuest. later shortening the name to Emporium in 1990. In 1991, Emporium assumed operation of the Sacramento-based Weinstock's department store chain, which had a similar merchandising structure. Finally in 1995 the chain and its parent (by then renamed Broadway Stores) were acquired by Federated Department Stores, which merged the Broadway, Emporium and Weinstock's stores with its own Macy's California and Bullock's stores to form Macy's West, renaming all the retained stores as Macy's. The Emporium location at Stanford Shopping Center was reopened by Federated's Bloomingdale's division in 1996, while after a decade of negotiation, bureaucratic red tape and intense physical reconstruction, the former flagship store of The Emporium on Market Street re-opened on September 28, 2006 as an expansion of the adjoining Westfield San Francisco Centre, which includes a new Bloomingdale's, the second-largest in the chain after its Manhattan flagship. The Emporium locations at The Shops at Tanforan and NewPark Mall became Target stores while Oakland and Solano Town Center locations became Sears. Almaden Plaza's location was subdivided into mixed retail use. The dome during construction of Westfield San Francisco Centre Phase II San Francisco and Oakland stores The flagship location at 835 Market Street, between 4th and 5th Streets, was a destination for generations of northern California shoppers. It was designed by San Francisco architect Albert Pissis, one of the first Americans to be trained at the √âcole des Beaux Arts in Paris. It withstood the 1906 earthquake, but was destroyed by the subsequent fire and rebuilt in 1908. Many additions and renovations were made in the decades following. It was also well-known locally for the holiday carnival on its roof and the annual parade when Santa Claus arrived by stagecoach or cable car to open the holiday season. In the late 1980s, the flagship Market Street store was connected to the new San Francisco Shopping Centre (now known as Westfield San Francisco Centre), a nine-story indoor mall anchored by a flagship Nordstrom location. The Emporium location closed permanently in February 1996, and after some controversy regarding the historic preservation of the building's facade and other elements, was redeveloped by Forest City Enterprises and The Westfield Group as an expansion of the existing San Francisco Centre with a West Coast flagship location of New York-based Bloomingdale's, which opened on September 28, 2006. The previously much-altered interior has been gutted and rebuilt to meet seismic standards and conform to modern retail configurations. The Emporium's historic domed glass roof was restored and is the centerpiece of the new facility. The developers were fined $2.5 million for demolishing part of the tower and failing to preserve parts of the structure. The newly expanded downtown mall has a total area of , boasts the largest Bloomingdale's location outside of New York City, features a nine-theater Century Theatres cineplex, and an upscale Bristol Farms specialty foods store. The H.C. Capwell flagship store is located at Broadway and 20th Street in downtown Oakland and opened in August 1929. The landmark structure suffered minor structural damage during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and was closed for repairs, but reopened early 1990. It had been a landmark shopping destination for East Bay residents for decades. Emporium closed its doors in February 1996 and, in March, Sears assumed possession. It remained in operation as Sears until its sale and closure in the summer of 2014, when it was scheduled to be renovated and converted to a high-tech retail/office space. Uber bought the building in 2015 and renovated it under the name Uptown Station, with the office space to become the company headquarters, then sold it in December 2017 to CIM Group.

He played college football at Ithaca College and spent more than 35 years as a football coach. He was the head coach of the Kansas Jayhawks football team from 1986 to 1987 and has also served as an assistant football coach in the National Football League with multiple teams. Early years A native of Seneca Falls, New York, Valesente attended Ithaca College in the early 1960s, where he played football as a halfback and defensive back. He was also an All-American baseball player at Ithaca. Career After leaving Ithaca, he played baseball in the Chicago Cubs minor league organization. He played for the Pocatello Chiefs in the Pioneer League in 1963 and the St. Cloud Rox in 1964. =Cornell= Valesente began his coaching career in 1964 as the coach of the freshman football team at Cornell University. He spent 11 years as an assistant coach at Cornell and was the defensive secondary coach from 1969 to 1974. =Cincinnati, Arizona, and Mississippi State= In 1975, Valesente was hired as the secondary coach at the University of Cincinnati under head coach Tony Mason. Valesente held that position for the 1975 and 1976 seasons. When Mason was hired as the head football coach at the University of Arizona in 1977, Valesente followed and assumed responsibility for the Arizona secondary. Valesente and Mason remained at Arizona from 1977 to 1979. In April 1980, Mason resigned after reportedly having been given a \\"quit-or-be-fired\\" option by the school. Three months later, Mason, Valesente and two others were indicted in Pima County Superior Court on charges that they had \\"bilked\\" the university out of $13,000 in travel funds. The Arizona coaches were alleged to have engaged in a conspiracy with an American Airlines employee in which the airline employee allegedly gave Mason and his coaching staff ticket receipts for trips they never took, which the coaches then submitted for reimbursement to the university. Valesente entered a not guilty plea to the charges. A jury found Mason not guilty following a trial in 1981, and Arizona Attorney General Bob Corbin announced in September 1981 that all remaining criminal charges had been dismissed against Valesente and the other defendants. Corbin also noted that a demand letter had been sent to Valesente requesting his return of $1,185 and that a civil action may be filed if the demand letter was not satisfied. He was the defensive coordinator and linebackers coach at Mississippi State University from 1980 to 1981. While at Mississippi State, he helped direct the team to a win over the University of Kansas in the Hall of Fame Bowl in 1981. =Baltimore Colts= In February 1982, Valesente was hired by the Baltimore Colts as the secondary and special teams coach under new head coach Frank Kush. Valesente remained with the Colts for the 1982 and 1983 NFL seasons. =Kansas= In April 1984, Valesente was hired as the assistant head coach and offensive coordinator at the University of Kansas. Shortly after being hired at Kansas, he was admitted to the Kansas University Medical Center after suffering chest pains and underwent emergency heart bypass surgery. Valesente remained as offensive coordinator for the 1984 and 1985 seasons. He took over as the head coach for the Kansas Jayhawks football team in 1986 and 1987. During Valesente's two seasons as head coach, the Jayhawks compiled a record of 4‚Äì17‚Äì1 and went 0‚Äì13-1 against Big Eight opponents. The Jayhawks went 1‚Äì9‚Äì1 in 1987 with their only win being a 16‚Äì15 game against Southern Illinois. Valesente was fired at the end of the 1987 football season. At the time of his firing, Valesente was in the second year of a four-year contract, which athletic director Bob Frederick said would be honored. Valesente told reporters, \\"I don't believe two years is enough to build a program. I just don't feel we've been given enough time.\\" Valesente had undertaken efforts to improve the team's academic standing and noted, \\"I feel proud of the fact that we have begun to overcome some of the immense academic problems that have plagued us. We needed to first stop the academic attrition.\\" Anthony Redwood, the chairman of the Kansas Athletic Corporation board and a business professor, resigned from the board in protest of the firing. Redwood noted, \\"Apparently we lack the courage at this institution to plan a course of action and stick with it. Certainly to the outside world this decision must call into question our commitment to the academic dimension of intercollegiate athletics.\\" Valesente's .204 winning percentage is the second- worst for a non-interim coach in KU history. =Maryland and Pittsburgh= He spent the 1988 season as the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach for the Maryland Terrapins football team. Valesente resigned after one year with Maryland. In 1989, he served as the defensive coordinator for the Pitt Panthers football team and was fired after one season in the position. =Pittsburgh Steelers, Green Bay Packers and Carolina Panthers= In March 1990, he was hired by Chuck Noll as the linebackers coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers. After two years with the Steelers, Valesente was hired by the Green Bay Packers in January 1992 to serve as their linebackers coach. From 1995 to 1998, he was the defensive backs coach for the Green Bay Packers. In January 1999, George Seifert hired Valesente as defensive backs coach with the Carolina Panthers. After one year in Carolina, Valesente announced his retirement in March 2000. At the time, Valesente said, \\"After 37 years of coaching, I decided I needed to spend more time with my family to enjoy all life has to offer. Coaching is a very demanding career that doesn't allow much free time.\\" =NFL Europe= Valesente later worked in the NFL Europe as a defensive coordinator for the Frankfurt Galaxy. =Amateur football in Europe= In 2010, he served as the defensive coordinator for the Kiel Baltic Hurricanes in the German Football League.Bob Valesente in AktionBob Valesente kommt nach Kiel Kiel won German Bowl XXXII that year and finished first in scoring defense, in overall defense and in passing defense.German Football League Team Stats 2010 He left Kiel before the 2011 season because of health issues,Bob Valesente muss abreisen but later returned to the sideline for one game during the German Bowl XXXIII loss to the Schw√§bisch Hall Unicorns.Coach Val zur√ºck in Kiel In December 2014, he was named defensive coordinator for the French national football team, where he was reunited with head coach Patrick Esume, who was also his head coach in Kiel.LES HEAD COACHS DES √âQUIPES DE FRANCE SENIOR ET JUNIOR OFFICIELLEMENT NOMM√âS In July 2015, France finish fourth at the 2015 IFAF World Championship, after a loss against Mexico (20-7).Mexico Beats France To Win Bronze At The World Championship In July 2017, he won the World Games championship against Germany with the French national football team (14-6).France takes American football gold, Germany with a silver medal Family Valesente and his wife, Joan Valesente, have three children, Ginger, Rob, and Michelle.

The area is not in fact a desert as its name suggests. The Agate Desert is so named because of the abundance of agate, petrified wood, jasper, and other minerals found there. Much of the World War II army training base of Camp White was built in the Agate Desert. The Nature Conservancy is working to preserve the Agate Desert as a native Rogue River Valley grassland. Ecosystem The area contains seasonal vernal pools that act as their own self-sufficient ecosystems. When the pools have dried up in the late spring, rings of wildflowers bloom in their place and the various creatures enter a period of dormancy until the next spring. The pools contain a rare species of fairy shrimp. The Agate Desert is also the only known place where the endangered big-flowered woolly meadowfoam plants grow and the desert contains over 500 of the plants. Cook's lomatium or Cook's Desert Parsley is also found in the Agate Desert and only grows naturally elsewhere in the French Flat of Illinois Valley, also in Oregon. In 1998, Henri Dumont discovered a new species, Dumontia oregonensis, also known as the Hairy Water Flea, in the desert, and it is not known to live anywhere else. Preservation Ecologists are currently conducting prescribed burns to the area, and volunteers are then spreading seeds of the native grasses and wildflowers in order to restore them to the area. Ecologists are also studying the various species, many of them rare, in the vernal pools. Development in the valley has left it at only about 25% of its original size.

The technique was first proposed by Ziegler et al. to determine the concentration profiles of boron impurities in silicon substrates, and later improved by Biersack and coworkers to much of its existing capabilities. Neutron depth In NDP, a thermal or cold neutron beam passes through a material and interacts with isotopes that emit monoenergetic charged particles upon neutron absorption; either a proton or an alpha, and a recoil nucleus. Since the charged particles are equally likely to be emitted in any direction, reaction kinematics are straightforward. Because low-energy neutrons are used, there is no significant momentum transfer from the neutron beam to the substrate, and the analysis is practically non-destructive. As charged particles move towards the surface, they are rapidly slowed down, primarily by interacting with the electrons of the substrate. The amount of energy loss is directly related to the thickness penetrated by the particle. The depth of the reaction site can be found by stopping power correlations. Profiling Conventionally, the residual energies of charged particles and recoil nuclei have been measured by a silicon charged-particle detector; most commonly either a surface barrier detector (SBD) or a passivated implanted planar silicon (PIPS) detector. In this configuration, the semiconductor detector is placed opposite to the surface of the sample being analyzed, and an energy spectrum of charged particles emitted by the neutron-induced reaction is acquired.

Composition  Blot of Quink ink on damp paper ‚Äì the blue dye has separated from the other components, which are peach-coloured Fountain pen ink is almost exclusively dye-based because fountain pens operate on the principle of capillary action. Pigment- based inks (which contain solid pigment particles in a liquid suspension) tend to clog the narrow passages of the pen.Fountain pen inks aren't all the same Retrieved 2011-02-20. Some pigmented inks do exist for fountain pens, but these are uncommon. India ink, a carbon pigment-based ink, also contains a binder, gum arabic, which can quickly clog such pens.A Few Notes About Fountain Pens. Retrieved 2011-02-20. The ideal fountain pen ink is free- flowing, free of sediment, and non-corrosive. These qualities may be compromised in the interests of permanence, manufacturability and in order to use some widely available dyes.Richard Binder on Ink. Retrieved 2011-02-16. A form of ink that predates fountain pens by centuries is iron gall ink. This blue-black ink is made from iron salts and tannic acid from vegetable sources. Prior to the ready availability of manufactured ink, iron gall ink was often homemade. Stark's ink was one iron gall ink recipe, named after the Scottish chemist who devised it after spending several decades experimenting with hundreds of formulations. Iron gall ink was used in fountain pens when they were invented but has the disadvantage of causing corrosion to metal parts. Modern formulations of iron gall ink are somewhat less corrosive and are still occasionally used in applications that require permanence. Bottle of green ink Red inks usually contain the dye eosin. Blue inks often contain triarylmethane dye. Black inks are mixtures. In addition to water, the non-dye components (collectively referred to as the vehicle) might include polymeric resins, humectants to retard premature drying, pH modifiers, anti-foaming agents, biocides to prevent fungal and bacterial growth, and wetting agents (surfactants). Surfactants reduce the surface tension of the ink; distilled water has a surface tension of 72 dyn/cm (72 √ó 10‚àí3 N/m), but the desirable value for ink is between 38 and 45 dyn/cm (38 to 45 √ó 10‚àí3 N/m). If the ink's surface tension were too high, then it would not flow through the pen; if it were too low, then the ink would run out of the pen with less control. Some users mix inks to create their own colours. Some combinations of inks may cause unexpected colour changes, even if the inks are from the same manufacturer. This is a result of chemical reactions between the different components. The colour of many dyes depends on pH, and some lose their colour entirely outside a certain pH range. Mixing inks may also alter the solubility of some dye components; for example, an alcohol-based ink may contain components that are insoluble in water, and these will precipitate or coagulate if the alcohol-based ink is mixed with a water-based ink.  Delivery  Top to bottom: blue Lamy T 10 proprietary ink cartridge and Z 27 and Z 28 ink converters Fountain pens carry ink within the barrel, traditionally either inserted at one end in bulk with a syringe or eyedropper pipette, or through a mechanical filling system built into the pen (such as a piston or vacuum-pump mechanism). For such fountain pens, ink is available in bottles which will typically refill an individual pen many tens of times. Simpler fountain pens use pre-filled ink cartridges, although in many cases the cartridge can be replaced with a converter which replicates the mechanical filling action of more expensive pens. The cost per millilitre of ink tends to be lower for bottled ink than for cartridges, while cartridges can be simpler to use. Care must be taken when using some vintage pens manufactured from celluloid, as this material can become stained by long-term exposure to some inks.  Manufacturers  Most fountain pen manufacturers also provide a brand of ink. For example, Parker sells \\"Quink\\", Pilot sells \\"Iroshizuku\\", Wancher sells \\"Silk Road\\", and Sheaffer sells \\"Skrip\\", while manufacturers like Waterman, Lamy, Hero, Pelikan, Thornton's Luxury Goods, Kaweco, Koh-i-Noor, and MontBlanc sell ink under the same branding as their fountain pens. The recent resurgence in fountain pen use has also created a market for companies that specialize in ink, such as the British company Diamine and American companies such as Private Reserve Ink and Noodler's Ink. These companies manufacture ink in dozens of different colours. Some companies that specialize in ink, like Noodler's and Private Reserve Ink, have also created ink with special properties, like glow in the dark, waterproofing, highlighting and indestructible (document) inks.  Durability and security  Noodler's Black fountain pen ink writing samples. This is a 'bulletproof' permanent ink featuring cellulose-reactive dye. In the late 20th century, particular attention has been paid by ink manufacturers to the durability of their products against the effects of time, light, moisture, and efforts at forgery or falsification (see Check washing). Some of these inks use pigments ‚Äì the solid pigment particles lodge between the cellulose fibers that make up the paper and are unaffected by attempts to remove them with solvents. Other inks use dyes that chemically bond with the paper's cellulose, and which likewise resist removal by solvents. A disadvantage of the dye inks is that, if spilled, they will form irremovable stains on clothing made from cotton, which also contains cellulose.

The act, which would be called the Anti-Coolie Act of 1862 in short, was passed by the California legislature in an attempt to appease rising anger among white laborers about salary competition created by the influx of Chinese immigrants at the height of the California gold rush. The act sought to protect white laborers by imposing a monthly tax on Chinese immigrants seeking to do business in the state of California.  Initial frustration with Chinese labor  Prior to the California gold rush of the 1850s, the Chinese population in the west, described at the time with the derogatory word \\"coolie\\", was minimal and tolerated by many Americans who migrated to the west to explore the new frontier. However, the California gold rush not only led to a steep increase in the white American population but also in the Chinese through immigration to the West. In 1852, California experienced an influx of 20,026 Chinese immigrants as compared to 2,716 just the year before. The large of influx of immigrants were met with race riots as white miners became frustrated with the increased competition for business. The intense emotions felt by a dense workforce, however, had more room to heat up, as they were exacerbated when America went through a recession between 1853 and 1854. The 1853 recession, characterized by low growth in the United States economy , featured American businesses contracting by 18.4% as interest rates rose and railroad investments decreased. The decrease in railroad investments drastically slowed down investments in the Wild West of California. What's more, commodity prices, including gold, dropped during that period. Thus, coupling the decrease in railroad investments with falling gold prices, the very source of the West's boom was strongly hurt and this served to worsen conditions in the west. The atmosphere would then become increasingly hostile, as segregation tools in the region were created, beginning with the creation of \\"coolie clubs\\". Coolie clubs In the wake of the 1853 recession, many Californians who owned the rights to the land on which the gold was mined were looking for cheap labor to maximize profits. Chinese immigrants came to America for a variety of reasons, including longstanding trans-Pacific economic connections, a culture of migrant work in the Pearl River delta region, and the presence of reasonably fast trade routes to the United States, and the allure of gold. Many Chinese immigrants made the voyage on credit, and upon arrival in California had no choice but to accept lower wages to repay their creditors. As a result of their lower demand for wages, and their tendency to form self- supporting communities without much support from their employers, Chinese immigrants became the preferred option of labor for many landowners. Domestic miners responded with the creation of \\"anticoolie\\" clubs that sought to create clear divisions between white workers and Chinese workers. The clubs almost served like white unions that represented the interests of the white miners in the west, and they expanded in prominence as manufacturing jobs moved to the west and Chinese workers continued to play the role of cheap labor. In 1857, just a few years prior to the passage of the Anti-Coolie Act in California, Chinese workers were accepting wages between one and two dollars less than their white counterparts. Anti-Coolie Act of 1862 The California legislature's formal attack on Chinese immigrants began in 1852 with the passage of a foreign miners' tax that imposed a three-dollar monthly tax on foreign miners in the state. In 1855, the California legislature followed up the passage of that act with another act entitled Discourage the Immigration to this State of Persons who Became Citizens thereof. However, after more pressure came from white miners, who teamed up with sympathizers in the Democratic Party to encourage the passage of the Anti-Coolie Act, it was indeed passed. The act was ratified by California's state legislature on April 26, 1862 and was an attempt to increase the scope of their authority by levying a $2.50 tax on anyone of Chinese origin who applied for licenses \\"to work in the mines, or to prosecute some kind of business....\\" Since Chinese workers subsisted on wages of $3 to $4 a month, the tax was a significant burden to shoulder. Yet, with the Chinese population still steadily increasing, reaching 107,000 in 1890, the act marked only the beginning of direct segregation against the Chinese. What would follow from the 1862 Anti- Coolie Act would be several anti-Chinese acts that served to discriminate against them. Eight years later, the Naturalization Act of 1870 allowed Africans to become citizens through naturalization, while continuing to exclude Asians. In 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which more directly restricted Chinese immigration and naturalization.

It is part of Maritime Prepositioning Ship Squadron Three. Its normal crew complement is 38 civilians and no military personnel.  History  SS Petersburg is part of the RRF, but is currently activated for duty with the Prepositioning Program. She is currently berthed in the Suisun Bay Reserve fleet, Benicia, California and has been there for the last several years as of late 2018. Previously she had been serving ten years at the island of Guam. In June 2006, the ship participated in exercise Valiant Shield. The Petersburg is not accessible to the public, though can be photographed from the water while maintaining a safe distance. The ship occasionally leaves berth in the ready reserve fleet to participate in active and operational training and exercises. Originally built in 1963, the Petersburg is one in a fleet of five tankers fitted with an offshore petroleum discharge system. She can carry up to 225,000 barrels of JP8 fuel. Offshore Petroleum Distribution System (OPDS) provides a semipermanent, all-weather facility for bulk transfer of refined bulk petroleum (e.g., JP5 and JP8) directly from an offshore tanker to a beach termination unit (BTU) located immediately inland from the high-water mark. POL then is either transported inland or stored in the beach support area. Major OPDS components are: the OPDS tanker with booster pumps and spread mooring winches, a recoverable single-anchor leg mooring (SALM) to accommodate four tankers up to 70,000 DWT, ship to SALM hose lines, up to four miles of six-inch (internal diameter) conduit for pumping to the beach, and two BTUs to interface with the shoreside systems. Three of the tankers (SS Petersburg, SS Chesapeake, and SS Mount Washington) contain a crane and stowage cradles for five OPDS utility boats (OUBs) (modified LCM-6s). OUB-equipped tankers carry adequate SLWT outfitting to equip one SLWT as a towtug and one SLWT as a lay repair boat carry one complete tanker terminal, and are equipped with five OUBs to deploy it. These tankers also have a maximum 59 LT capacity crane to load/offload the five OUBs carried on board.

She has been most notably portrayed by Eileen Davidson, who originated the role on June 11, 1982 before departing in 1988. Brenda Epperson portrayed Ashley from 1988 to 1995, before Shari Shattuck portrayed the role for the next three years, until Davidson's return on March 19, 1999. Davidson was nominated in 2003 for Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. The character is the daughter of Dina Mergeron and Brent Davis, although she believed John Abbott was her biological father until she reached adulthood. She has had relationships with various men throughout the years, most notably Steven Lassiter, Victor Newman, Blade Bladeson, Cole Howard and Brad Carlton. She has a daughter with Victor, Abby Newman. She is also known for her business contributions to her father's company, Jabot Cosmetics, much like her brother Jack. In 2006, it was announced that Davidson was to leave The Young and the Restless. She last appeared on January 11, 2007. Shortly after, the character crossed over to its sister soap, The Bold and the Beautiful. There, she became intertwined with the Forresters and Forrester Creations; she also had a romance with Ridge Forrester. She left The Bold and the Beautiful in 2008 and returned to The Young and the Restless, where she has since had relationships with Victor once again and Tucker McCall. In May 2012, it was announced that Davidson was let go from The Young and the Restless, leading to her exit on August 3, 2012. Davidson initially hadn't known why, but it was reported later that Sony Pictures Television terminated her contract with the show for her to return to Days of Our Lives as Kristen DiMera, a character she had portrayed there over 14 years prior. Davidson made a brief return to The Young and the Restless in March 2013 for the soap's 40th anniversary. After subsequent guest appearances, Davidson returned to The Young and the Restless on September 3, 2014, as a series regular. In 2018, Davidson again exited the role; she returned in March 2019, following the installment of head writer Josh Griffith. Casting Eileen Davidson originated the role of Ashley Abbott on June 11, 1982, until her first exit on December 2, 1988. The role was immediately recast with Brenda Epperson, who portrayed Ashley for seven years from December 5, 1988 before leaving the role on December 21, 1995. Shari Shattuck then assumed the role from March 21, 1996 to February 22, 1999, with Davidson returning on March 19, 1999. Davidson took maternity leave in the summer of 2003. In 2006, news broke that Davidson was to exit the soap opera, and she last aired on January 11, 2007. She then carried the role of Ashley over to the show's sister soap, The Bold and the Beautiful. On September 25, 2008, Davidson returned to The Young and the Restless, and subsequently made one final appearance on The Bold and the Beautiful on November 25 of the same year when Ashley resigned from her position at Forrester. In May 2012, Davidson informed followers on her Twitter page that she had been let go from The Young and the Restless. Davidson further confirmed she did not know why she was let go, but was seeing the positive light from it. It was then announced by Nelson Branco that Sony Pictures Entertainment wanted Davidson on both The Young and the Restless and Days of Our Lives, but that Y&R; would not share the actress, leading to Sony terminating her contract with the soap. Thus it was announced that Davidson would reprise her role as Kristen Blake on the NBC soap. Davidson made her onscreen exit on August 3, 2012. Speaking about her upcoming return to Days and departure from the show with TV Guide, Davidson stated: \\"What happened to me at Y&R; was shocking ‚Äî I've been in this business a very long time and have never seen anything like it ‚Äî but it's not like I haven't been fired before.\\" She also went on to say that \\"I was led to believe that I was fired, though it was a bad news-good news thing ‚Äî the bad news is Y&R; is firing you, the good news is Days wants you.\\" In February 2013, it was announced that Davidson would return to The Young and the Restless for \\"very special episodes\\" that would commemorate the show's 40th anniversary. In spite of this, the actress remained a part of Days of our Lives full-time. In August 2013, following the announcement of Davidson's departure from Days of our Lives, it was announced that she would again reprise the role for three episodes airing in October, later returning for an guest appearance on November 27 and December 2, 2013. In June 2014, it was announced that Davidson had signed a two-year contract with The Young and the Restless to appear as a regular cast member again, and would return to the series in September. Davidson also revealed her contract would allow for her to continue making appearances on Days of Our Lives. In June 2018, Daytime Confidential broke news that Davidson had quit the role. Davidson last appeared in the role on October 29, 2018. On February 25, 2019, Davidson announced she would return to the role for several appearances; first airing on March 29, 2019. Character development Davidson describes Ashley as a \\"dynamic character\\".http://jamaica- gleaner.com/gleaner/20070203/ent/ent3.html She has been characterized as \\"sassy\\" yet an \\"honorable heroine\\". The Record describes Ashley as \\"headstrong\\". She is recognized for her unluckiness and long-term suffering. Davidson stated, \\"She is a heroine. So often she was being victimized by people and trying to always rise above that, and being driven insane and losing babies, etc.\\" In 1990, The Washington Times described Ashley as a \\"smart woman\\", known for her \\"level head\\" and \\"business success\\". Ashley is dedicated to her work and has a strong sense of family. She is a beloved member of the Genoa City community. Her passion for the family business, Jabot Cosmetics, cost Ashley her marriage to Cole Howard (J. Eddie Peck). Ashley has been involved in a number of different romantic relationships over her duration on the series. Her relationship with Brad Carlton (Don Diamont) came as a shock, due to Brad being beneath her socially. Epperson, who played Ashley at the time, was uncertain of Ashley and Brad's decision to get married. Davidson opined that a storyline in which Victor's son Adam Newman (Michael Muhney) gaslighted a pregnant Ashley in 2009 was payback for Ashley stealing Victor's sperm years ago to conceive Abby. She stated: \\"I think the character really suffered after she stole Victor‚Äôs sperm from Diane [...] After that, the viewers lost a lot of respect for Ashley. People wanted Ashley to pay for it. My opinion? Although last summer‚Äôs gaslighting storyline was used to propel a lot of other stories, it was also about making Ashley pay. Now we can close that entire chapter because Ashley paid. It was Ashley‚Äôs redemption\\". Around this story arc, Tommy Garrett of Canyon News described Ashley as a \\"damsel in distress\\", stating that she had a \\"twisted mind\\" due to suffering a hysterical pregnancy after losing her unborn child at the hands of Adam. Following the death of John, Jack works desperately to remove his wife Gloria Abbott (Judith Chapman) from the family, even illegally making changes to John's will. Explaining Ashley's ambivalence towards the situation, Davidson stated: \\"Just because you don't like somebody doesn't mean you should do something illegal [...] The point is, their father loved her. And even if they don't like her, they have to honor what he wanted. Ashley never wanted to do anything that went against her father's wishes.\\" The actress stated that Ashley \\"just wants\\" Jack to \\"do the right thing\\".  Storylines  Ashley is born on April 29, 1960, to John Abbott, Sr. (Brett Halsey, later Jerry Douglas) and Dina Abbott Mergeron (Marla Adams). Twenty-two years later, after completing college, Ashley returns to Genoa City and applies for a job as a lab chemist at Jabot Cosmetics, the family company, using the name Susan Ashley so she will be hired for her skills, not her family connections. She takes over as president of the company after her brother Jack Abbott (Terry Lester, later Peter Bergman) is shot on his one-year anniversary by his wife, Patty Williams. Ashley commences an unlucky streak of relationships; starting with French artist Eric Garrison, who slept with her mother, and Marc Mergeron, who is revealed to be her former stepbrother. Capitalizing on her unluckiness, it is revealed that Ashley's biological father is Brent Davis, not John Abbott, who remains unaware of Ashley's true paternity. Trauma leads Ashley to become missing with amnesia, where she is found by business tycoon Victor Newman (Eric Braeden), who takes her back to Genoa City. Ashley has an affair with Victor, who is married to Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott). To spite Ashley, Nikki engages in an affair with Jack and tries to have Victor's brother, Matt Miller, unsuccessfully seduce Ashley. Ultimately, Victor chooses to be with Ashley, angering Nikki. When Ashley falls pregnant with Victor's child, Nikki is diagnosed with cancer, causing Victor to leave Ashley, who secretly has an abortion. Ashley suffers a mental breakdown, before marrying her psychiatrist Steven Lassiter (Rod Arrants). Steven's former patient Leanna Randolph (Barbara Crampton) stalks the couple and attempts to destroy Ashley. She writes a biography about Victor that exposes information about his dysfunctional relationship with Ashley. Steven is later shot and killed by an unstable patient. Following a short affair with Brad Carlton (Don Diamont), Ashley marries Victor. The marriage suffers because of Nikki's ongoing problems as well as Victor's daughter Victoria Newman's (Heather Tom) constant schemes to break them up. After her divorce from Victor, Ashley falls in love with Jabot's mysterious photographer Blade Bladeson (Michael Tylo), and they get married. Blade's vengeful twin brother Rick Bladeson arrives in town, holds Blade hostage and impersonates him. Eventually, Ashley and Blade's marriage ends. She then falls romantically for Kurt Costner (Leigh McCloskey), who is shot saving her from muggers. The romance is short-lived, as Kurt leaves Ashley to be with Victor's ex-wife Hope Wilson (Signy Coleman). Ashley nearly engages in an affair with Victoria's husband Cole Howard (J. Eddie Peck), an author who is writing a novel about her life, which requires them to spend time together. After Victoria's pregnancy results in a stillborn baby, Cole divorces her and marries Ashley. The marriage suffers a rough patch when Ashley travels to Madrid to help her stepbrother Rafael Delgado (Carlos Bernard), who is dealing with dangerous customers after selling them forged paintings. Cole assumes that she is having an affair with Rafael, unaware of who he is. During this, Victoria attempts to sabotage the marriage. Ultimately, upon Ashley's return to Genoa City, the couple divorce. By 2000, one of Jack's former lovers and Victor's latest ex-wife, Diane Jenkins (Alex Donnelley) steals Victor's sperm from a sperm bank, though Nikki switches the sample with Jack's sperm. Ashley then steals Victor's sperm and impregnates herself, claiming that the father is a stranger; this was to make up for the abortion she had years prior. She then marries Brad Carlton and gives birth to Abby Carlton, who is raised to believe she is the daughter of Brad. Ashley is diagnosed with breast cancer, and feeling that she may not have time left, she confesses the truth about Abby's paternity to Victor. Brad and Ashley split, though are brought together when she becomes pregnant with their child. Stress over the battle between Jabot and Newman Enterprises causes her to leave town. While she is driving back, she is involved in a car accident, killing the unborn child. Victor is blamed for the child's death. Brad and Ashley's marriage continues to diminish and they are divorced. Tom Fisher (Roscoe Born), the dangerous ex-husband of John's wife Gloria Abbott (Judith Chapman), arrives in town. To protect his family, John shoots and kills Tom. Ashley covers this up by confessing to the crime herself, though John soon confesses himself, and is jailed for seven years. Gloria contaminates Ashley's new line of beauty cream, which causes a woman to die. John suffers a heart attack following his release from prison, and passes away. Jack removes Gloria from the family, and Ashley leaves town to escape the drama. During a business trip to France, Ashley meets Rick Forrester (Kyle Lowder), and they have an affair. She later travels to Los Angeles to work with Forrester Creations as a lab chemist. Rick and Ashley decide to keep their affair a secret, and she commences a serious relationship with Ridge Forrester (Ronn Moss), whom she becomes engaged to. Ridge's attentiveness to his former love Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang) ends the engagement. Ashley then has a short-lived romance with Brooke's brother Storm (William deVry). Forrester Creations decide to discontinue their fragrance line, diminishing Ashley's role in the company. She leaves Los Angeles and moves to Europe with Abby. Ashley locates a missing Victor in France, where they reunite. Upon their return to Genoa City as a couple, they are married and Ashley becomes pregnant. Victor's manipulative son Adam Newman (Michael Muhney) gas lights Ashley, making her believe that she is seeing the ghost of Victor's late wife, Sabrina Newman. Adam causes Ashley to fall down a staircase and lose her baby, though he convinces her that this was a dream, and she suffers from an hysterical pregnancy. Ashley checks herself into a psychiatric hospital where Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), also pregnant, is staying. After Ashley begins experiencing hysterical labor, Adam kidnaps Sharon's newborn baby Faith Newman and gives her to Ashley, with Sharon believing her baby was stillborn. In the ensuing months, Sharon marries Adam and develops a close friendship with Ashley. Six months after Faith is born, the doctor that delivered her (who was being blackmailed by Adam) confesses the truth in a letter. Ashley is forced to hand Faith over to Sharon and the child's father, Victor's son Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow). Ashley moves on with her life, and becomes engaged to wealthy tycoon Tucker McCall (Stephen Nichols). Prior to their engagement, he slept with Diane Jenkins (Maura West). They briefly split up because of Tucker's secret business plans with Jack, but reunite shortly thereafter. Abby accidentally runs over Tucker with her car, and Ashley protects her by taking the blame. She is accused of attempted murder and driving under the influence. All charges are ultimately dropped, and she marries Tucker. Their marriage quickly lands in divorce because of Tucker's business scheming and his affair with a previous lover, Harmony Hamilton. Ashley is later forced out as CEO of Jabot by Jack, and Ashley decides to move to New York City with Traci. She returns briefly a few months later for the wedding of Victor and Nikki. Months later, Ashley returns for the funeral of her niece Delia Abbott and comforts her brother Billy on his loss. She returns later to spend Thanksgiving with her family. While there, she sprained her ankle and met Dr. Stitch Rayburn (Sean Carrigan). Abby pushed for a romance, but Ashley reminded her that Stitch was married and had a young son. In town for Abby and Tyler's engagement party, Ashley left early to drop by the hospital and \\"run into\\" Dr. Rayburn. But she found Victoria waiting for him to take her on a date. Ashley reminded her that she'd only been separated a week. When Ben arrived, Victoria was jealously catty, informing Ben that Ashley was her former stepmother. In September 2014, Ashley did not show up in Genoa City after calling a meeting among the major Jabot stockholders, Jack, Billy, Traci, and Abby. Jack phoned her, and she explained that she was working on a special project, but had decided it was not yet ready to present to them. The following month, Ashley returned and confirmed that her idea was for a revolutionary new fragrance, and she made a deal with Jack to become Co-CEO of Jabot again if it panned out. Abby had been treating Ben Rayburn nasty and spiteful ever since she found out that he had killed his father as a teen and taken someone else's identity to get his degree in medicine, and broken Victoria's heart. So Abby was shocked when Ashley hired Ben as a chemist for Jabot, despite Abby's objections. Ashley returned to New York City to wrap things up, tasking a reluctant Abby with bringing Ben up to speed on the cosmetics industry. Before she left, she consoled Billy that maybe she could help keep Ben away from Victoria for him. On Ashley's return, she asked Ben to smell the new fragrance, he found it repulsive, but he kissed her. Ashley revealed that the fragrance contained pheromones, was a love potion, and the kiss had proven it. What she needed was his help to make the scent bearable. Later after Ben was arrested for fraud by a former patient, Ashley bailed him out. She confided in Ben, that she too had taken a murder rap for someone she loved. Ashley asked him to accompany her to Madison on business. Ben showed up in Ashley's office drunk after seeing Billy and Victoria snuggling with their baby. Ashley threw him in the shower to sober him up, and he pulled her in too. They had sex, and Stitch spent the night. The next day, they agreed to tell no one after Ben found out that he still had a chance with Victoria. Victor invited Ashley to lunch and tried to get her to take a deal to leave Jabot and work for him at Newman-Chancellor. But Ashley declined and left early, arriving back at the lab in time to see her lab assistant Tobias taking photos of their secret work. She guessed that he was working for Victor, and decided to let him continue in order to feed him bogus information. Ashley runs into Joe Clark at the athletic club. After referring to them having a good thing going back in New York City, they made plans to spend New Year's Eve together. In May 2017, Ashley's mother Dina came for a \\"permanent\\" visit. In October 2017, Dina exposed that John Abbott wasn't Ashley's father. Ashley leaves Genoa City in October 2018, following a series of events that leave her feeling alienated from both the Abbott family and Jabot, following the discovery that John and Dina left legal documents leaving all of Ashley's product patents to her; she confesses she's leaving for Paris to launch her own company with said-patents. Reception Jamey Giddens of Zap2it described Davidson as \\"one of Genoa City's most beloved heroines\\". Upon learning of Davidson's return to the role in 1999, Candace Havens of the McCook Daily Gazette declared that it was her who made Ashley \\"one of the most popular characters on soaps\\". In October 1999, when all of the Abbott siblings and their father John were together again, the Orlando Sentinel wrote: \\"In the meantime, having the entire Abbott clan together [...] is like a joyous family reunion for longtime viewers\\". John Goudas of The Gadsden Times was favorable of Epperson's performance two years into her duration, stating that she \\"is holding her own\\", though he noted her to be \\"Eileen's double\\". He stated that the front-burner status of Ashley and Brad's romantic storyline demonstrated that producer William J. Bell \\"has full confidence in [Epperson]\\". The character has had a rivalry with Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott) for many years; a poll run in 2008 by website Daytime Confidential asking, \\"Who would win a cat fight, Nikki Newman or Ashley Abbott?\\", saw 63% of voters say Nikki would win, with 37% saying Ashley would win. Giddens was favorable of Ashley running Jabot Cosmetics in 2008, writing: \\"Okay this has to stop. My heart simply can't take it. It's like the effects of yo-yo dieting. Everytime I sincerely think I am done with this genre, something like The Young and the Restless heiress Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson) announcing that she, not Lil' Billy (Billy Miller), not Cruella de Bardwell (Judith Chapman) or Gary Ewing (Ted Shackelford) and no, not even Smilin' Jack (Peter Bergman) will be running Jabot Cosmetics, happens.\\" In 2009, Jillian Bowe (also of Zap2it) wondered if Ashley was \\"insane in the membrane\\" due to her hearing a crying child around the Newman ranch, writing: \\"Is \\"The Beauty\\" starting to crack up? Certainly looks that when some freaky things take place on The Young and the Restless.\\" In 2010, Tommy Garrett of Canyon News praised a scene in which Ashley discovers a sex tape made by her spoiled daughter, Abby, that was posted online. Garrett wrote: \\"Davidson‚Äôs performance is spot on as the mother Ashley who is fed up. The tears of despair and exhaustion came streaming down Davidson‚Äôs beautiful face in character, while her spit-fire daughter didn‚Äôt give a damn.\\" Giddens later wrote that he thought it was \\"ridiculous\\" and \\"outlandish\\" to make Ashley pregnant with Victor's child in 2009. Also in 2010, Neeketa Borden of Zap2it created a list of \\"curiously quirky couplings\\", with Ashley and Tucker listed as an \\"honorable mention\\". In a separate review, Garrett credited Davidson as one of the \\"powerful performers who daytime TV could not exist without having\\". When the truth was going to come out that Faith Newman wasn't Ashley's child, Giddens wrote: \\"Lord, I hope this doesn't make my Ashley Abbott go cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs again!\\" Mike Jubinville of Zap2it wrote that the character's relationship with Neil Winters (Kristoff St. John) had been a \\"slow burn, one going on for weeks, but one that is hard to miss. It has the ingredients of a hot romance.\\" Upon Davidson's firing in 2012, Giddens wrote: \\"I am sincerely hoping the brass at Y&R; can't possibly be this stupid, but if they are, Gary Tomlin better blow up Davidson's phone STAT about a Days of Our Lives return!\\"  References  External links *Ashley Abbott character profile on SoapCentral The Young and the Restless characters The Bold and the Beautiful characters Television characters introduced in 1982 Fictional business executives Fictional female businesspeople Fictional socialites Fictional characters with cancer Fictional characters with neurological or psychological disorders Female characters in television ","title":"Ashley Abbott"},{"id":"5701006","text":"Fritz Moritz Heichelheim (May 6, 1901, Gie√üen ‚Äì April 22, 1968, Toronto) was a German-born ancient historian, who specialized in ancient economic history, at the University of Gie√üen and as Professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Toronto. Fritz Moritz Heichelheim was the son of a banker, Albert and his wife Bertha (n√©e Simonsfeld). She was murdered by the Nazis in 1942. Heichelheim was a pupil of the ancient historian Richard Laqueur at Gie√üen where he took his doctorate in 1925 and his habilitation in 1929. His doctoral thesis was \\"Foreign Inhabitants of Ptolemaic Empire\\" while his habilitation thesis was \\"Economic Fluctuations from the time of Alexander to that of Augustus\\". He worked between his doctorate and habilitation as a high school teacher. After lecturing there for nearly four years, he, like his colleague at Gie√üen, Margarete Bieber, was dismissed in 1933 in accordance with the National Socialists‚Äô \\"cleansing\\" of the universities (see Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service). However, in fact he was dismissed a few months earlier because of a defiant lecture on Jews in Roman Palestine and Syria. Like many German scholars, he was forced to emigrate abroad. He lived for many years without a steady job as a private tutor in Cambridge, England and the receipt of a fellowship from the University of Cambridge. In that year, he married his wife Gerta (n√©e Oppenheimer). In 1938, he published the German version of An Ancient economic history. With an improvement of the terms of his fellowship, he and his wife decided to have a child who was born in 1939 and named Peter. On the outbreak of the Second World War he volunteered to join the branch of the British Army for noncitizens but was refused because of age. In 1940 Heichelheim was interned by the British as a German alien. Two years later he was hired at as an assistant lecturer at the University of Nottingham. He received British Citizenship immediately following the Second World War. He directed the excavation of a Roman Site at Cross Hill, Nottingham. Also at that time, he tried to make contact with the German universities. In 1948 he went there for a short time as an honorary professor of economic history. In 1948 he went to Canada as a lecturer at the University of Toronto. He was promoted at first to assistant professor and to associate professor. Finally he was made full professor at the University of Toronto from 1962 to his death. He went briefly to Germany as visiting professor to the Free University of Berlin in 1961. He was elected Fellow of The Royal Society of Canada in 1966. He was one of the early members of Congregation Habonim (Congregation Habonim Toronto), a liberal synagogue founded by Holocaust survivors and refugees from Central Europe, who arrived in Canada after World War II, and one of the first Holocaust refugee/survivor congregations to develop in Canada. On April 22, 1968, he died at Toronto. In spite of the difficulties he had, he published two books and over 600 articles. A History of the Roman People is still in print. This productivity can be explained partially by the fact that since his student days, he slept only four hours at night. At the University of Cambridge, he began cataloguing the Greek coins in the Fitzwilliam Museum. The results of these labours can be seen in Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum, Vol. 4, Parts 1-6 (London, 1940‚Äì65). He also collaborated with E. N. Adler, F. L. Griffith, and J. G. Tait in the publication of The Adler Papyri (London, 1939). Heichelheim tried to foster closer relations between the Universities of Giessen and Toronto. It was through his initiative that the two institutions embarked on a cooperative project, that of editing and publishing the Greek, Coptic, and certain Latin papyri preserved in the university library at Giessen. A particularly interesting article was Roman Coins from Iceland from 1952. He theorized that the Roman coins found in Iceland were from Germans at the time of the Roman Empire who travelled to Iceland. A modern discussion is found in Roman Coins in Iceland by David Bjarni Heidarsson on http://skemman.is/stream/get/1946/5084/15120/2/Badbh.pdf. Heichelheim's contribution is discussed on page 20. At the time there was interest not only by scholars, but in the public press including The New York Times.

Central Asian Oil Pipeline Project In the 1990s, the American Unocal Corporation considered in addition to the Trans-Afghanistan Gas Pipeline building also a oil pipeline to link Turkmenistan's T√ºrkmenabat (former Chardzou) to India along the Arabian Sea. Through the Omsk (Russia) ‚Äì Pavlodar (Kasakhstan) ‚Äì Shymkent ‚Äì T√ºrkmenabat Pipeline, it would provide a possible alternative export route for regional oil production from the Caspian Sea. The pipeline was expected to cost US$2.5 billion. However, due to political and security instability, this project was dismissed. Disputed theory Some critics have proposed that the actual motive for the Western invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 was Afghanistan's importance as a conduit for oil pipelines from Azerbaijan to Afghanistan's neighbouring countries. Others have argued that the theoretical pipeline was not a significant reason for the invasion because most Western governments and their respective oil companies prefer an export route. This route goes through the Caspian Sea to Azerbaijan then to Georgia and on to the Black Sea instead of one that goes through Afghanistan. Bypassing Russian and Iranian territories would break their collective monopoly on regional energy supplies.

Little is known of his reign. He held Serbia during the growing threat posed by the neighbouring, hitherto peaceful, Bulgarian Khanate, which had expanded significantly toward Serbia. At the time, the Bulgars and the Byzantine Empire were at peace by treaty, and although the Byzantine Emperor was overlord of the Serb lands, he was unable to aid the Serbs in a potential war. Presian I of Bulgaria eventually invaded Serbia, resulting in a three-year-war, in which the Bulgar army was devastated and driven out. Vlastimir then turned to the west, expanding well into the hinterland of Dalmatia. He is the eponymous founder of the Vlastimiroviƒá dynasty, the first Serbian dynasty. Background =Serbian realm and family history= Europe in 814. The prince (archon) that led the Serbs to the Balkans and received the protection of Heraclius (r. 610‚Äì641), known conventionally as the Unknown Archont, was an ancestor of Vlastimir. The Serbs at that time were organized into ≈æupe, a confederation of village communities (roughly the equivalent of a county), headed by a local ≈æupan (a magistrate or governor). According to Fine, the governorship was hereditary, and the ≈æupan reported to the Serbian prince, whom they were obliged to aid in war. Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (r. 913‚Äì959) mentions that the Serbian throne is inherited by the son, i.e., the first-born, though on one occasion there is a triumvirate in his enumeration of monarchs. The Serbs established several future principalities by the 10th century: Serbia (roughly the later province of Rascia, including Bosnia; part of Zagorje - \\"hinterlands\\"); and Pagania, Zachlumia, Travunia (including Kanalitai) and Dioclea (part of Pomorje - \\"maritime\\"). Vi≈°eslav, the great-grandfather of Vlastimir and first Serbian monarch known by name, was a contemporary with Charlemagne (fl. 768‚Äì814). He directly held the hereditary lands of Neretva, Tara, Piva and Lim. Constantine VI conquered the Sclaviniae (slavdom - \\"slav area\\") of Macedonia, situated to the south, in 785. Radoslav, then Prosigoj, succeeded Vi≈°eslav, and they ruled during the revolt of Ljudevit Posavski against the Franks (819‚Äì822). According to the Royal Frankish Annals, written in 822, Ljudevit went from his seat at Sisak to the Serbs, who controlled the greater part of Dalmatia. =Rise of Bulgarian power= Bulgarian expansion by 814. In the east, the Bulgarian Empire grew strong. In 805, khan Krum conquered the Braniƒçevci, Timoƒçani and Obotrites, to the east of Serbia, banished their tribal chiefs, and replaced them with administrators appointed by the central government. In 815, the Bulgarians and Byzantines signed a 30-year peace treaty. In 818 during the rule of Omurtag (814‚Äì831), the Braniƒçevci and Timoƒçani together with other tribes of the frontiers, revolted and seceded from Bulgaria because of an administrative reform that had deprived them much of their local authority. The Timoƒçani left the societas (association, alliance) of the Bulgarian Empire, and sought, together with the Danubian Obotrites and Guduscani, protection from Holy Roman Emperor Louis the Pious (r. 813‚Äì840), and met him at his court at Herstal. The Timoƒçani migrated into Frankish territory, somewhere in Lower Pannonia, and were last mentioned in 819, when they were persuaded by Ljudevit to join him in fighting the Franks. The Danubian Obotrites stayed in Banat, and resisted the Bulgars until 824, when nothing more is heard of them. The khan sent envoys to the Franks and requested that the precise boundary be demarcated between them, and negotiations lasted until 826, when the Franks neglected him. The Bulgars answered by attacking the Slavs that lived in Pannonia, and subjugated them, then sent ships up the Drava river, and, in 828, devastated Upper Pannonia, north of the Drava. There was more fighting in 829 as well, and by this time, the Bulgars had conquered all of their former Slavic allies.Einhard, year 827 The Bulgarian Khanate (later Empire) had a general policy of expansion in which they would first impose the payment of tribute on a neighboring people and the obligation of supplying military assistance in the form of an alliance (societas), leaving them internal self-government and local rulers, and when the need for this kind of relationship expired, they would terminate the self-government arrangement and impose direct and absolute power, integrating their neighbor fully into the Bulgarian political and cultural system. Life and reign Vlastimir succeeded his father, Prosigoj, as the archon of Serbia. According to ≈Ωivkoviƒá, the date of Vlastimir's accession was around 830. He united the Serbian tribes in the vicinity. The Serbs most likely consolidated due to alarm at the advance of the Bulgarian Khanate towards their borders‚Äîa rapid conquest of neighbouring Slavs‚Äîin self- defence, and possibly sought to cut off the Bulgar expansion to the south (Macedonia). Emperor Theophilos (r. 829‚Äì842) was recognized as the nominal suzerain (overlord) of the Serbs, and most likely encouraged them to thwart the Bulgars. The thirty-year-peace treaty between the Byzantines and Bulgars, signed in 815, was still in effect. =War with the Bulgarian Khanate= Emperor Theophilos, who was the overlord of the Serbs, was prohibited to aid Vlastimir in a potential war with the Bulgars as a peace treaty was in effect. Some historians maintain that he had an important part in the Bulgar-Serb war. According to Constantine VII, the Serbs and Bulgars had lived peacefully as neighbours until the invasion in 839 (in the last years of Theophilos). It is not known what exactly prompted the war, as Porphyrogenitus gives no clear answer; whether it was a result of Serbian-Bulgarian relations, i.e., the Bulgar conquest to the southeast, or a result of the Byzantine-Bulgarian rivalry, in which Serbia was an Imperial ally. It was not unlikely that the Emperor had a part in it; as he was at war with the Arabs, he may have pushed the Serbs to drive the Bulgars from western Macedonia, which would benefit them both. According to J. Bury, this alliance would explain Malamir's action. Zlatarski supposes that the Emperor offered the Serbs complete independence in return. According to Porphyrogenitus, the Bulgars wanted to continue their conquest of the Slav lands and force the Serbs into subjugation. Presian I (r. 836‚Äì852) launched an invasion into Serbian territory in 839, which led to a war that lasted for three years, in which the Serbs were victorious; the heavily defeated Presian lost a large number of his men, made no territorial gains, and was driven out by Vlastimir's army. The Serbs held out in their easily defensible forests and gorges, and knew how to fight in the hills. The war ended with the death of Theophilos in 842, which released Vlastimir from his obligations to the Empire. According to ≈Ωivkoviƒá, it is possible that the Bulgarian attack came after the failed invasion of Struma and Nestos in 846 (see next section): Presian may have collected his army and headed for Serbia, and Vlastimir may have participated in the Byzantine‚ÄìBulgarian Wars, which would mean that Presian responded to a direct Serbian involvement. The defeat of the Bulgars, who had become one of the greater powers in the 9th century, shows that Serbia was an organized state, fully capable of defending its borders, and possessing a very high military and administrative organization. It is not known whether Serbia at the time of Vlastimir had a fortification system or developed military structures in which the ≈æupan had clearly defined roles. =Expansion= Supposed political map of the Western Balkans, 9th century. After the victory over the Bulgars, Vlastimir's status rose. He went on to expand to the west, taking Bosnia, and Herzegovina (Hum). Vlastimir married off his daughter to Krajina, the son of a local ≈æupan of Trebinje, Beloje, in ca. 847/848. With this marriage, Vlastimir elevated Krajina's title to archon. The Belojeviƒá family was entitled to the rule of Travunia. Krajina had a son with Vlastimir's daughter, named Hvalimir, who would later on succeed as ≈æupan of Travunia.DAI, p. 161 Vlastimir's intent to connect to the ruling house of Travunia shows, in context, that his reputation among the neighbouring Serbian archontes and ≈æupani was on the rise, as well as the political importance and military strength of Serbia. It is possible that, prior to Vlastimir's reign, the Travunian ≈æupan sought to free himself from Serbia's influence, but that Vlastimir found the solution in the political marriage of his daughter to Krajina. The elevation of Krajina's title (which meant the practical independence of Travunia) strongly suggests that Vlastimir was a Christian ruler who understood very well the monarchal ideology that developed in the early Middle Ages. There is a possibility that the marriage took place before the conflict with the Bulgars, which makes another theory likely: that the Bulgars reacted to Vlastimir's rising political position, particularly given that he had the right to confirm rulers in the neighbouring Serbian principalities with Byzantine sanction. Although Vlastimir's elevations of titles were merely symbolic, rather than a reflection of administrative-political relations, it does show that he had the right to act this way, which undoubtedly puts him at the head of all Serbian archontes‚Äîviz., the leading ruler among the Serbian principalities. The Paganians, also known as Narentines, who are described by De Administrando Imperio as Serbs, engaged the Venetians on the Adriatic (they were noted pirates), and killed more than 100 of doge Pietro Tradonico's men. Soon after 846, with the end of the thirty-year-truce, Malamir (or Presian) invaded the regions of the Struma and the Nestos, and Empress-Regent Theodora (r. 842‚Äì855, the wife of Theophilos) answered by attacking Thracian Bulgaria. A brief peace was concluded, then Malamir proceeded to invade Macedonia. The Bulgars also imposed rule on the Morava region, the frontier region between Serbia and the Bulgarian Khanate; in 844, an anonymous Bavarian geographer mentions the Merehani as the people that bordered the Franks furthest away. They lived in the valleys of the present-day Morava river basin, and were still unconquered by the Bulgarians. However, after 845, the Bulgars added these Slavs to their societas; they are last mentioned in 853. The Byzantines were also active in the hinterland of Dalmatia, to the west of Serbia; the strategos of the cities of Dalmatia came into conflict with a Frankish vassal, Duke Trpimir I of Croatia, in 846/848, who defeated the strategos. Vlastimir was succeeded by his three sons about 851. Family Seal of prince Strojimir of Serbia, from the late 9th century Vlastimir had three sons and one daughter:DAI, pp. 154‚Äî5 *Mutimir, Prince, 851‚Äì891 *Strojimir, Prince (co-ruler), 851‚Äì880s *Gojnik, Prince (co-ruler), 851‚Äì880s *Unnamed daughter, married Krajina Belojeviƒá Aftermath Vlastimir's three sons successfully fought off an onslaught by Boris I of Bulgaria in 853 or 854 (shortly after the death of Vlastimir), when they captured 12 great boyars and the commander himself, Vladimir, the son of Boris. The Bulgars had sought to avenge the previous defeat of Presian in 842. The two sides made peace, and possibly an alliance. The two younger brothers later revolted against Mutimir for undisclosed reasons. Mutimir sent them as prisoners, a guarantee of peace, to the court of Boris I at Pliska. After Mutimir requested that Emperor Basil I (867‚Äì886) baptize his lands, Constantinopolitan priests were sent and a Serbian bishopric was founded. The Christianization is evident in the tradition of theophoric names found in the next generation of Serbian monarchs (e.g., Petar Gojnikoviƒá, Pavle Branoviƒá). The three branches of Vlastimir's sons continued a succession war over the decades. The Bulgars under Boris I were persuaded by Moravian Prince Rastislav to attack Louis the German of East Francia. The Bulgar-Slav campaign ended in disaster, and a peace was signed in 855. The following year, the Byzantine army, led by Michael III and caesar Bardas, recaptured Philippopolis (Plovdiv), the region of Zagora and the ports around the Gulf of Burgas on the Black Sea. In 863, the Byzantines invaded the Khanate once again, during a period of famine and natural disasters. Boris I was forced to sign a peace and to convert to Christianity, in return for which he was gifted Zagora. The cradle of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church was founded about 870 in Pliska. On July 11, 2006, A golden seal of Strojimir, dated to 855-896, was acquired by the Republic of Serbia at auction in Munich, Germany, for 20,000 ‚Ç¨, beating a Bulgarian bid of 15,000 ‚Ç¨.

Background It is thought that the rapid extension of Bulgars over Slavs to the south prompted the Serbs to unite into a state. It is known that the Serbs and Bulgars lived in peace until the invasion in 839 (the last years of Theophilos). Vlastimir united several Serbian tribes,L. Kovacevic & L.

The war ended with the death of Theophilos in 842, which released Vlastimir from his obligations to the Byzantine Empire, but also gave the Bulgarians the opportunity to annex the areas of Ohrid, Bitola and Devol in 842‚Äì843.

PDF In 853 or 854, the Bulgar Army, led by Vladimir, the son of Boris I of Bulgaria, invaded Serbia in an attempt to exact vengeance for the previous defeat. The Serbian Army was led by Mutimir and his brothers, which defeated the Bulgars, capturing Vladimir and 12 boyars.The early medieval Balkans, p. 141 Boris I and Mutimir agreed to cease hostilities (and perhaps an alliance), and Mutimir sent his sons Bran and Stefan to the border to escort the prisoners, where they exchanged items as a sign of peace. Boris gave them \\"rich gifts\\", while he was given \\"two slaves, two falcons, two dogs, and 80 furs\\". An internal conflict among the brothers resulted in Mutimir banishing the two younger brothers to the Bulgarian court.The Serbs, p. 15 He, however, kept the son of Gojnik, Petar, in his court for political reasons. Petar soon fled to Croatia. The reason for the feud is not known, although it is hypothesized that it was the result of treachery. Mutimir sent envoys to Byzantine Emperor Basil I, asking him to baptize the lands.De Administrando Imperio, ch. 29 [Of Dalmatia and of the adjacent nations in it]: \\"...the majority of these Slavs [Serbs, Croats] were not even baptized, and remained unbaptized for long enough. But in the time of Basil, the Christ-loving emperor, they sent diplomatic agents, begging and praying him that those of them who were unbaptized might receive baptism and that they might be, as they had originally been, subject to the empire of the Romans; and that glorious emperor, of blessed memory, gave ear to them and sent out an imperial agent and priests with him and baptized all of them that were unbaptized of the aforesaid nations...\\" He put Serbia under the suzerainty of the Byzantine Empire. The Saracens attacked Ragusa in 866.Pokr≈°tavanje Ju≈ænih Slovena The Ragusians asked Basil I for help, which he answered, sending a large fleet with his admiral Niketas Ooryphas. The pagan Narentines sacked a ship with emissaries returning from Constantinople, which enraged Basil I, resulting in him sending a fleet and subsequently subduing them. By 878, all of Dalmatia was under Byzantine rule (Theme of Dalmatia), and most of the land was under the religious jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Mutimir died in 891 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Pribislav. He was most likely buried in the Church of Peter and Paul at Ras, as was Petar (r. 892‚Äì917). Mutimir and his son Pribislav (as \\"Preuuisclavo\\") were apparently entered in the Cividale Gospels, which could indicate Serbian contacts with Aquileia. Serbia's transition to Christianity would, therefore, coincide with similar initiatives by Rome in Moravia and Bosnia-Slavonia (as, incidentally, also in Bulgaria) and suggest a coordinated action in south-eastern Europe originating in Rome. =Christianization= Croats and Serbs delegation with Basil I Church of Saint Apostles Peter and Paul The Serbs were baptized by Constantinopolitan missionaries sent by Basil I, after Mutimir had acknowledged Byzantine suzerainty. Basil may have also sent a bishop.A history of Christianity in the Balkans, p. 73 The Christianization was due partly to Byzantine and subsequent Bulgarian influence.The entry of the Slavs into Christendom, p. 208 It is important to note that at least during the rule of Kotsel of Pannonia (861‚Äì874), communications between Serbia and Great Moravia must have been possible. The pope was presumably aware of this fact when planning Methodios' diocese, as well as the fact that the Dalmatian coast was in Byzantine hands as far north as Split. There is a possibility that some Cyrillomethodian pupils reached Serbia in the 870s, perhaps even sent by Methodius himself. Serbia is accounted Christian as of about 870. The lasting Christian identity is evident in the tradition of theophoric names in the next generation of Serb royalty: Petar Gojnikoviƒá, Stefan Mutimiroviƒá and Pavle Branoviƒá. Petros and Stephanos are both characteristically Byzantine. The first Serbian bishopric was founded at the political center at Ras, near modern Novi Pazar on the Ibar river. The initial affiliation is uncertain; it may have been under the subordination of either Split or Durazzo, both then Byzantine. The early church of Saint Apostles Peter and Paul at Ras, can be dated to the 9th‚Äì10th century, with the rotunda plan characteristic of first court chapels.The entry of the Slavs into Christendom, p. 209 The bishopric was established shortly after 871, during the rule of Mutimir, and was part of the general plan of establishing bishoprics in the Slav lands of the Empire, confirmed by the Council of Constantinople in 879‚Äì880. The Eparchy of Braniƒçevo was founded in 878 (as a continuation of Viminacium and Horreum Margi). Mutimir maintained the communion with the Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Constantinople when Pope John VIII invited him to recognize the jurisdiction of the bishopric of Sirmium in a letter dated to May 873.Gabriella Schubert, Serbien in Europa: Leitbilder der Moderne in der Diskussion, p. 23 The Serbs and Bulgarians subsequently adopted the Old Slavonic liturgy instead of the Greek.

It was fought between elements of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army 34th Division (44th Division from Chinese sources) and the Filipino 10th Battalion Combat Team (BCT), north of Yeoncheon during April 22-23, 1951. The battle was part of the Chinese Spring Offensive.  Background  The Philippine 10th BCT was attached to the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division at the time of the offensive. Initially composed of 1,367 troops, the battalion was reduced to 900 men due previous casualties and other losses. To prepare for the incoming Chinese offensive, the U.S. 65th Infantry Regiment deployed its 3rd and 2nd Battalions, facing west and northwest, respectively, along the Imjin River, while the attached Philippine 10th BCT held the regiment‚Äôs right flank near Route 33. The Turkish Brigade, was just east of the Filipino unit. Opposite the United Nations Command forces in the area were the PVA's III Army Group, composed of the 12th, 15th, and 60th Armies. The overall commander of the Chinese PVA forces, Peng Dehuai, planned to have the 12th and 15th Army attack and encircle the Turkish Brigade and the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division, respectively. Near the Imjin River, the 15th Army had a narrow zone between the river and Route 33 projecting through the area held by the 65th Regiment. Along Route 33 and east of it, the 12th Army and 60th Army were to attack through ground held by the Philippine 10th BCT on the right flank of the 3rd Division and through the Pogae-san ridges occupied by the Turkish Brigade and 24th Infantry Division.  The battle  Unit positions near Yultong during the Chinese Spring Offensive. The assault began at 20:00 on 22 April when the enemy hit the Turkish Brigade with an artillery barrage. Shortly after midnight, an artillery and mortar barrage followed by intense small-arms and machine gun fire struck the entire 3rd Division line. While the Turks were engaged in fierce battle, the 10th BCT, deployed in the Yultong area on the left of the Turks, from 23:00 was assaulted in waves by the Chinese and fought a series of close combat engagements within its positions. Communication with the 65th Regiment was disconnected by enemy artillery and some friendly fire support but was restored at 00:30. Around midnight, the Turks were ordered to withdraw to a position on the Line Kansas south of the Hantan River. The 65th Regiment's 2nd Battalion was forced to fall back several hundred yards to regroup due to the intensity of the Chinese attack. At 01:00 of 23 April, the 29th and 44th Divisions of the Chinese 15th Army surrounded the 65th Regiment, cutting off its retreat. The battle forced the 10th BCT's drivers, typists, clerks, medics, cooks, and even the chaplain to join the active combatants. Each company was dispersed and fought in confusion without contact between the units. The battalion's Baker (B) Company, commanded by Lt. Jose Artiaga, Jr., was defending the strategic Yultong Hill when Chinese forces overran their position; the left platoon of B Company was pushed back from their position at 03:00 and, after four hours of furious combat, the enemy infiltrated as deeply as Charlie (C) Company position in the reserve area. The company suffered heavy casualties, including Lt. Artiaga. The battalion commander, Col. Dionisio S. Ojeda, received orders to withdraw. All units complied, except the Tank (renamed into Heavy Weapons) Company. Tank Company commander Capt. Conrado Yap led a counterattack towards the hill to rescue any survivors and recover the dead men of B Company. Although Capt. Yap lost his life in the counterattack, Tank Company succeeded in their objective and recovered a squad of survivors. The 10th BCT held their positions until early morning and covered the retreat of the U.S. 3rd Division. At first light, the Chinese offensive gradually declined, and the battalion launched a counterattack to restore the lost area of B Company. C Company supported by two M24 Chaffee light tanks of Recon Company and an allied artillery unit led the counterattack. At 09:00 on 23 April, Gen. James Van Fleet, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, ordered a withdrawal to Line Kansas after concluding that many units in I and IX Corps were in danger of being enveloped by the Chinese forces. At 12:15, the 10th BCT finally received orders from Gen. Robert Soule to fall back to Line Kansas, withdrawing to a position in Anhung- ri.  Aftermath  For their actions, Capt. Conrado D. Yap was posthumously awarded the Philippine Medal of Valor and the U.S. Distinguished Service Cross, while Lt. Jose Artiaga, Jr. was posthumously awarded the Philippine Distinguished Conduct Star. On July 27, 2018, Capt. Yap was awarded the First Class Taegeuk Cordon of the Order of Military Merit on the 65th anniversary of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The 10th Battalion Combat Team reported 12 killed, 38 wounded, and 6 missing in action. Chinese losses were reported to be more than 500 killed and 2 captured. On 24 April 1951, the 10th BCT was attached to the British 29th Brigade Group as a reserve force, and would later participate in the attempted rescue of the Gloucestershire Regiment during the Battle of the Imjin River. On 22 April 1966, the 15th anniversary of the Chinese Spring Offensive, a monument was erected to commemorate the battle in Yeoncheon, South Korea.

J. Cherryh. It is an early novel in her career, about colonists on an alien world and their interactions with the catlike natives, centering on a young engineer sent to solve the colonists' problems, and his relationship with the young native cat- woman in scanty clothing on the cover. Major themes in this novel include sexual liberation, sexual aberration, relevance of social mores, hypocrisy of social mores, personal work ethic, personal responsibility, ecological responsibility, blame-shifting, bureaucratic inertia, administrative reflex reactions, the mindset of the engineering profession, and responsibility toward indigenous peoples. Many other characters and the world itself are not developed with as much depth as those in some of Cherryh's other early works, such as Gate of Ivrel, The Pride of Chanur, Merchanter's Luck, and The Dreamstone. Notably, the alien cat-people in this novel are entirely different from the hani of the Chanur novels, being in temperament and culture somewhat more like housecats than lions. Plot summary Engineer Sam Merrit has been sent to the planet Hestia to build a dam. The colonists believe that a dam will enable them to expand beyond their single river valley and escape the squalid conditions that have persisted there since the founding of the colony over a hundred years ago. Upon arrival Merrit finds that, in his professional judgment, a dam will not solve the colony's problems, and the construction of the dam will force the relocation of many of the cat-like alien natives as the reservoir fills. However, having made the years-long sublight journey to Hestia at great personal inconvenience, he is reluctant to return home without accomplishing anything. From the start, he has little patience for the colonists' blame-shifting attitude, and as he becomes familiar with one of the alien women, Merrit becomes increasingly convinced that destroying the alien culture by building the dam is not an acceptable option.

Traditional and revolutionary Romanticism  Portrait of Lord Byron by Thomas Phillips, 1813. Romanticism is thought of as complex and confusing, with great contradictions that range from rebellious, revolutionary ideas to the return of the Catholic and monarchial tradition. With respect to political liberty, some understood it merely as the restoration of the ideological, patriotic, and religious values that the 18th century rationalists had tried to suppress. They exalted Christianity, throne, and country as supreme values. In this \\"traditional Romanticism\\" camp one would place Walter Scott in Scotland, Chateaubriand in France, and the Duke of Rivas and Jos√© Zorrilla in Spain. It was based on the ideology of the restoration of absolute monarchy in Spain, which originated after the fall of Napoleon Bonaparte, and defended the traditional values represented by Church and State. On the other hand, other Romantics, as free citizens, fought the entire established order in religion, art, and politics. They proclaimed the rights of the individual over and against society and the law. They represented \\"revolutionary\\" or \\"liberal\\" Romanticism, and their most notable members were Lord Byron, in England, Victor Hugo, in France, and Jos√© de Espronceda, in Spain. The movement's three underlying ideas were: the quest for and justification of \\"irrational\\" understanding, which reason denies, Hegelian dialectic, and historicism.  Costumbrism  Costumbrism focused on contemporary life, largely from the point of view of the \\"common\\" people, and expressed itself in pure, correct language. The principal author in the Costumbrist style was Ram√≥n de Mesonero Romanos, situated on the margins of Romanticism, and in an ironic position in relation to it. Costumbrism, born out of Romanticism, but as a manifestation of nostalgia for the values and customs of the past, contributed to the decadence of the Romantic movement and the rise of Realism, as it became bourgeois and turned into a style of description.  Historic context  The Romantic period encompasses the first half of the 19th century, a time of high political tension. The conservatives defended their privileges, but the liberals and progressives fought to supplant them. This opened the way for the laity and Freemasonry to enjoy great influence. Traditional Catholic thought defended itself against the freethinkers and the followers of the German philosopher Karl C. F. Krause. The working class unleashed protest movements with anarchist and socialist tendencies, accompanied by strikes and violence. While Europe experienced significant industrial development and cultural enrichment, Spain presented the image of a somewhat backward country that was always apart from the rest of Europe.  Characteristics of Romanticism  *Rejection of Neoclassicism. Faced with the scrupulous rigor and order with which rules were observed in the 18th century, the romantic writers combined the genres and verses of distinct media, at times mixing verse and prose; in the theater the rule of three unities (action, place, and time) was despised, and they alternated the comic with the dramatic. Painting by Caspar David Friedrich. * Subjectivism. Whatever the type of work, the passionate soul of the author poured into it all of its feelings of dissatisfaction with a world that limited and frustrated the expression of its longings and worries, in relation to love, society, and country alike. They identified nature with spirit, and expressed it as melancholy, gloom, mystery, and darkness, in contrast with the neo- Classicists, who barely showed interest in the natural world. Insatiable cravings for passionate love, happiness, and the possession of the infinite caused in the Romantics a disheartenment, an immense disappointment that sometimes brought them to suicide, as in the case of Mariano Jos√© de Larra. *Attraction of the nocturnal and mysterious. The Romantics situated their sorrowful and disappointed feelings in mysterious or melancholic places, such as ruins, forests, and cemeteries. In the same manner, they felt attracted to the supernatural, that which escapes logic, such as miracles, apparitions, visions from beyond the grave, the diabolical, and witchcraft. *Flight from the world. Their disgust toward the bourgeois society that they were forced to live in caused the Romantics to try to turn their back on their circumstances, imagining past eras in which their ideals prevailed, or taking inspiration from the exotic. In contrast with the neo-Classicists, who admired Greco-Roman antiquity, the Romantics preferred the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Their favorite modes of expression were the novel, legends, and historical drama. Beginnings Romanticism came to Spain through Andalusia and Catalonia. In Andaluc√≠a, the Prussian consul in C√°diz, Juan Nicol√°s B√∂hl de Faber, father of novelist Fern√°n Caballero, published a series of articles between 1818 and 1819 in the Diario Mercantil (Mercantile Daily) of C√°diz, in which he defended Spanish theatre of the Siglo de Oro, and was widely attacked by the neo- Classicists. Against him were Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Mora and Antonio Alcal√° Galiano, who argued from a traditionalist, antiliberal, and absolutist point of view. B√∂hl de Faber's ideas were incompatible with theirs (since they were still tied to the Age of Enlightenment), despite the fact that they represented European Literary Modernism. In Catalonia, El Europeo was a journal published in Barcelona from 1823 to 1824 by two Italian editors, one Englishman, and the young Catalans Bonaventura Carles Aribau and Ram√≥n L√≥pez Soler. This publication defended moderate traditionalist Romanticism following B√∂hl's example, totally rejecting the virtues of Neo-Classicism. An exposition of the Romantic ideology appeared for the first time in its pages, in an article by Luigi Monteggia, titled Romanticismo.  Poetry  B√©cquer in Sevilla. The romantic poets created their works in the midst of a fury of emotions, forming verses out of whatever they felt or thought. Critics have found in their works a lyricism of great power, but at the same time vulgar, uninspiring verse. Some of the characteristics of Romantic poetry are: * The I, the inner self. Jos√© de Espronceda, setting down in his Canto a Teresa a painful confession of love and disappointment, managed with great skill to translate his feelings into poetry. * Passionate love, with its sudden and total surrenders and quick abandonments. The agony and the ecstasy. * Inspiration by historical and mythical subjects. * Religion, though frequently it is through a revolt against consequent compassion, even to the extent of exalting the devil. * Social vindication, value placed on marginalized people, such as beggars *Nature, displayed in all its manifestations and variations. Romantics often gave their poems mysterious settings, such as cemeteries, storms, the raging sea, etc. *Satire, frequently associated with political and literary events. It was also a sign that a new spirit was inspiring the creation of verse. By contrast with the monotonous neoclassic repetition of songs and lyrics, poets proclaimed their right to use all existing variations on meter, to adapt those from other languages, and to innovate where necessary. In this respect, as in others, Romanticism prefigured the modernist audacities of the end of the century. = Jos√© de Espronceda = Jos√© de Espronceda Espronceda was born in 1808 in Pajares de la Vega, located near Almendralejo, Badajoz. He founded the secret society of Los numantinos, whose aim was to \\"demolish the absolutist government\\". Because of his involvement with this society, Espronceda was imprisoned. At age 18 he fled to Lisbon and joined with a group of liberal exiles. There he met Teresa Mancha, the woman with whom he lived in London. After an act of political agitation, he returned to Spain in 1833. He lived a dissipated life, full of incidents and adventures, which caused Teresa Mancha to leave him in 1838. He was at the point of marrying another lover, when in 1842 he died in Madrid. > ::Batallas, tempestades, amor√≠os, ::por mar y tierra, lances, descripciones > ::de campos y ciudades, desaf√≠os ::y el desastre y furor de las pasiones, > ::goces, dichas, aciertos, desvar√≠os, ::con algunas morales reflexiones > ::acerca de la vida y de la muerte, ::de mi propia cosecha, que es mi > fuerte. > ::Battles, tempests, love affairs, ::by sea and land, deeds, descriptions > ::of countryside and cities, challenges ::and the disaster and furor of > passions, ::enjoyments, happiness, successes, deliriums, ::with some moral > reflections ::about life, death, and ::my forte: My own personal harvest. Espronceda worked in the principal literary genres, such as the historical novel, with Sancho Salda√±a o El castellano de Cu√©llar (1834), and the epic poem, with El Pelayo, but his most important work was his poetry. He published Poes√≠as in 1840 after returning from exile. It is a collection of poems of different types, which brings together his youthful neoclassic poems with other, more intense, Romantic works. These last were the most important, and elevated marginalized types: Canci√≥n del pirata (Song of the Pirate), El verdugo (The Executioner), El mendigo (The Beggar), and Canto del cosaco (Song of the Cossack). His most important works were El estudiante de Salamanca (1839) and El diablo mundo: *El estudiante de Salamanca (1839): This composition consists of some two thousand verses of different lengths. It narrates the crimes of don F√©lix de Montemar, whose lover Elvira dies of heartsickness when he abandons her. One night, he sees her ghost and follows it through the streets and contemplates his own burial. In the house of the dead, he marries the corpse of Elvira, and dies. *El diablo mundo: This work was never finished. It consists of 8,100 verses of various meters, and it seems to be an epic of the human life. The second canto (Canto a Teresa) occupies the better part of the poem, and in it he evokes his love for Teresa and laments her death. = Other poets = Gertrudis G√≥mez de Avellaneda Carolina Coronado In spite of the brief period during which romantic lyric poetry thrived in Spain, there arose other notable poets who deserve mention, such as the Barcelonan Juan Arolas (1805‚Äì1873), the Galician Nicomedes Pastor D√≠az (1811‚Äì1863), Gertrudis G√≥mez de Avellaneda (1814‚Äì1873) and Pablo Piferrer (1818‚Äì1848). Piferrer, in spite of writing only in Spanish, was one of the precursors of the romantic movement in Catalonia. Gertrudis G√≥mez de Avellaneda Gertrudis G√≥mez de Avellaneda y Arteaga (March 23, 1814 ‚Äì Madrid February 1, 1873) was a Cuban writer and poet of the 19th century. Although Cuban, she lived most of her life in Spain. She wrote various poems, plays, and novels. Her most famous work is an antislavery novel called Sab (novel). Carolina Coronado Carolina Coronado (Almendralejo, 1823‚ÄìLisbon, 1911) merits special mention. She spent a great part of her childhood in the Extremaduran countryside, and from a very young age showed a talent for poetry. She married an American diplomat and lived in various foreign countries. Family misfortune prompted her to seek solitude and retreat in Lisbon, where she died in 1911. Her most important work is Poes√≠as (1852).  Prose  During the Romantic period, there was a great interest in literary fiction, in particular, adventure and mystery novels; however, Spanish output of this type was scanty, limited to translations of foreign novels. More than a thousand translations circulated in Spain before 1850, in the historic, romantic, chivalrous, and melodramatic genres, representing writers such as Alexandre Dumas, p√®re, Chateaubriand, Walter Scott, and Victor Hugo. Spanish prose essentially consisted of the novel, scientific or scholarly prose, journalism, and the intense development of costumbrismo. During the first quarter of the century, four distinct types of novels developed: moral and educative novels, romances, horror stories, and anticlerical novels. The most purely Romantic of these is the anticlerical novel. However, the Romantic influence would shape, principally, the historical novel. = Historical novels = The historical novel developed in imitation of Walter Scott (80 of his works had been translated), author of Waverley, Ivanhoe, and other novels of adventure set in the Scottish and English past. Spanish historical novels fall into two categories: liberal and moderate. Within the liberal school existed both anti-clerical and populist currents. On the other hand, the moderate school produced, on occasion, novels exalting traditional and Catholic values. The most notable Spanish authors are: * Enrique Gil y Carrasco (Villafranca del Bierzo), 1815‚ÄìBerl√≠n 1846. A lawyer and diplomat, he was the author of El se√±or de Bembibre, the best Spanish historical novel, written in imitation of Walter Scott. * Francisco Navarro Villoslada (1818‚Äì1895), who wrote a series of historical novels when the romantic genre was in decline and Realism was coming to be at its height. His novels were inspired by Basque traditions, and were set in the medieval era. His most famous work is Amaya, o los vascos en el siglo VIII (Amaya, or the Basques of the 8th century), in which the Basques and the Visigoths ally themselves against the Muslim invasion. * It is also worth mentioning the contributions to the historical genre made by Mariano Jos√© de Larra, Seraf√≠n Est√©banez Calder√≥n and Francisco Mart√≠nez de la Rosa. = Scholarly writing = The majority of these works originated from the discussions in the assembly that adopted the Constitution of C√°diz. The most representative authors were Juan Donoso Cort√©s (1809‚Äì1853) and Jaime Balmes Urp√≠a (1810‚Äì1848): * Juan Donoso Cort√©s came from the liberal school, though later he defended Catholic and authoritarian ideas. His most important work is the Ensayo sobre el catolicismo, el liberalismo y el socialismo (Treatise about Catholicism, Liberalism, and Socialism), published in 1851. His style has a solemn yet compelling tone, and provoked lively debates. * Jaime Balmes, however, belongs in the conservative, Catholic camp. Of his prolific output, El protestantismo comparado con el catolicismo en sus relaciones con la civilizaci√≥n europea (Protestantism compared with Catholicism in their relations with European civilization) (1842) and El criterio (1845) stand out. = Costumbrist vignettes= Between 1820 and 1870, Spain developed the literatura costumbrista (literature of manners), which manifested itself in the cuadro de costumbres, or vignette of everyday life, a short prose article. These works were normally restricted to descriptive text, keeping argument to a minimum. They described the lifestyle of the era, a popular custom, or a personal stereotype. In many cases (as in the articles of Larra), the articles contain considerable satire. Costumbrismo (or costumbrism) arose out of the Romantic desire to emphasize the different and the peculiar, inspired by the French affinity for the same genre. Thousands of articles of this type were published, thus limiting the development of the novel in Spain, since narration and individual characters predominated in that genre, while costumbrist vignettes were limited to generic descriptions of personality types (bullfighter, chestnut seller, water carrier, etc.). Large anthologies of such vignettes were compiled, such as Los espa√±oles pintados por s√≠ mismos (Spaniards painted by themselves), (published in two volumes in 1843‚Äì1844, reprinted in one volume in 1851). Notable authors represented in this work are the madrile√±o Ram√≥n de Mesonero Romanos and the Andalusian Seraf√≠n Est√©banez Calder√≥n. Ram√≥n de Mesonero Romanos Ram√≥n Mesonero Romanos (1803‚Äì1882) was born and died in Madrid. He belonged to the Spanish Academy and was a gentle bourgeois. His ideas were anti-Romantic and he was a great observer of the life around him. He was famous under the pseudonym El curioso parlante (The talking bystander). His principal literary production was in the costombrist tradition; however, he wrote Memorias de un setent√≥n (Memories of a 70-year-old), an allusion to the people and events he knew between 1808 and 1850. His costumbrist works were collected in the volumes Panorama matritense and Escenas matritenses. Seraf√≠n Est√©banez Calder√≥n Calder√≥n (1799‚Äì1867) was born in M√°laga and died in Madrid. He was known as El solitario (The solitary one), and held high political office. Though known for his conservatism, in his youth he was a liberal. He published various poems and a historical novel, Cristianos y moriscos (Christians and Moors), though his most famous work is a collection of costumbrist vignettes Escenas analuzas (Andaluc√≠an scenes) (1848), containing descriptions such as El bolero, La feria de Mairena, Un baile en Triana, and Los Fil√≥sofos del fig√≥n. = Journalism: Mariano Jos√© de Larra = Mariano Jos√© de Larra Throughout the 19th century, the role of the newspaper was decisive. The Barcelona publication El Europeo (The European) (1823‚Äì1824) published articles about romanticism and, through the publication, Spain came to know the names of Byron, Schiller and Walter Scott. However, the press was also an arm of the political fight. In this sense, we must emphasize the political satire press of Trienio Liberal (El Zurriago, La Manopla), where there appeared not only social themes, but also customism outlines which were clear precedents of Larra's production. After the death of Fernando VII in 1833, many important changes occurred in journalism. The emigrants after the absolutist reaction of 1823 returned and together with the new generation (that of Jos√© de Espronceda and Larra) they would mark the style of the era, though they had learned much in their years of exile from the advanced presses of the English and the French. In 1836, the French Girardin initiated in his newspaper La Presse a custom which would have a staggering and lasting success: that of publishing novels by delivery. The Spanish press, always with their eyes on the press of their neighbors, hurried to copy this initiative; however, the height of this era in Spain would be between 1845 and 1855. Mariano Jos√© de Larra, El pobrecito hablador (The poor little talker) Mariano Jos√© de Larra (Madrid, 1809‚Äìid., 1837), son of a liberal exile, soon conquered fame as a journalist. His character was less than agreeable. Mesonero Romanos, his friend, spoke of \\"his innate mordacidad, which carried few sympathies\\". At twenty he married, but the marriage failed. With total success as a writer, at 27 years of age, Larra committed suicide with a pistol to the head, it seems, for a woman with whom he maintained an illicit love affair. Though Larra is famous for his newspaper works, he also worked in other genres, like poetry, short neoclassics and satire (S√°tira contra los vicios de la corte, or \\"Satire against the vices of the court\\"); the theatre, with the historical tragedy Mac√≠as; and finally, the historical novel, with El doncel de don Enrique el Doliente, about a Gallego troubador who kills a husband blinded by jealousy. Larra's Newspaper Articles Larra wrote more than 200 articles, behind the fa√ßade of diverse pseudonyms: Andr√©s Niporesas, El pobrecito hablador and above all, F√≠garo. His works can be divided into three groups: customs, literary articles y political articles. * In the customism articles, Larra satirized the form of Spanish life. He felt a great pain for his imperfect mother country. Emphasis should be placed on Vuelva usted ma√±ana (\\"Come back tomorrow\\" - a satire of public officials), Corridas de toros (\\"Bull races\\"), Casarse pronto y mal (\\"Get married soon and badly\\", with autobiographic undertones) and El castellano grosero (\\"The crude Castilian\\", against the crudity of the countryside). * His French education prevented him from fostering his neoclassic tastes, and this is reflected in his 'literary articles, where he criticized the romantic works of the era. * In his political articles, his progressive, liberal education is clearly reflected, with hostile articles about absolutism and traditionalism. In some of these, Larra reveals his revolutionary exultation, as in the article which says \\"Asesinatos por asesinatos, ya que los ha de haber, estoy por los del pueblo\\" (\\"Murders by murders, since we must have them, I am for those of the people\\").  Theatre  Neo-classical theatre did not manage to have much effect on Spanish tastes. At the beginning of the 19th century, works from the Siglo de Oro became popular. These works were disdained by the neo-Classicists for not following the rule of three parts (action, place, and time) and for mixing comic and dramatic aspects. Nevertheless, these works were successful outside Spain, precisely because they did not conform to the neo-Classical ideal. Romanticism triumphed in the Spanish theatre with La conjuraci√≥n de Venecia (The Venetian Conspiracy), by Francisco Mart√≠nez de la Rosa, El Trovador (The Troubador), by Antonio Garc√≠a Guti√©rrez, and Los amantes de Teruel (The Lovers of Teruel), by Juan Eugenio Hartzenbusch. But the key event was in 1835, when Don √Ålvaro o la fuerza del sino (Don √Ålvaro, or the Power of Fate), by the Duke of Rivas, had its premiere. Drama was the most developed of the theatrical genres. All works contained lyrical, dramatic, and fantastical elements. Freedom ruled in all aspects of the theatre: * Structure: The rule of the three unities, imposed on Spanish literature of the Enlightenment, disappeared. Dramas, for example, could have five acts in verse, or in prose and mixed verse, with variable metre. If in neo-Classical works stage directions were unacceptable, this did not prevail in Romanticism, where they occurred frequently. The monologue took on new importance, becoming the principal means of expressing a character's internal struggle. * Setting: Theatrical action gained dynamism by using a variety of settings in the same production. Authors set their works in places typical of Romanticism, such as cemeteries, ruins, solitary countrysides, prisons, etc. Nature corresponded to the feelings and states of mind of the characters. * Plot: Romantic theatre tend to have plots with legendary, adventurous, knightly, and historical- national themes, with love and freedom as typical elements. Frequent motifs were nocturnal scenes, duels, shadowy, mysterious characters, suicides, and displays of gallantry or of cynicism. Events occurred at a dizzying speed. The point of drama was not to enlighten, as the neo-Classicists intended, but rather to move. * Characters: The number of characters in a play increased. The masculine hero was usually brave and mysterious. The heroine was innocent and faithful, but having an intense passion. But both were marked for a fatal destiny; death is liberation. More importance was given to the dynamism of the action than the psychology of the characters. = √Ångel de Saavedra, Duke of Rivas = √Ångel de Saavedra, Duke of Rivas √Ångel de Saavedra y Ram√≠rez de Baquedano (C√≥rdoba, 1791 ‚Äì Madrid, 1865) struggled against the French invasion as a young man and gained political prominence as a progressivist. He was condemned to death for his liberal views but managed to escape to England. In Malta he met an English critic who taught him to appreciate Classical theater and set the stage for him to become a Romantic. He lived in France during his exile, and returned to Spain a decade later in 1834. By his return, the Neo- classical liberal had morphed into a Romantic and moderate liberal. √Ångel de Saavedra held a number of important public posts. Like many contemporary writers, he began by adopting a neo-classical aesthetic in the lyrical (Poes√≠as, 1874) and dramatic genres (Lanuza, 1822). He gradually incorporated Romantic elements into his work as can be seen in works like El desterrado. His conversion became complete in Romances hist√≥ricos. Rivas' fame is largely based on his work Leyendas and especially Don √Ålvaro o la fuerza del sino, a play which premiered in the Teatro del Pr√≠ncipe (the modern-day Teatro Espa√±ol) in Madrid in 1835. 1,300 spectatores attended and witnessed the first Spanish Romantic drama, featuring such novelties as combining prose and verse. = Jos√© Zorrilla = Jos√© Zorrilla Born in Valladolid, 1817 and died in Madrid, in 1893. He started his career in literature by reading verses at the funeral of Larra, with which he earned great fame. He married a widow sixteen years younger than him, but the marriage failed and, fleeing from her, he went to France and then to Mexico in 1855, where the emperor Maximiliano named him director of the National Theater. Upon returning to Spain in 1866 he was greeted with enthusiasm. He married again and, with constant monetary penuries, he had no other remedy but to sell his works unprofitably, like Don Juan Tenorio. The courts granted him a pension in 1886. Works The literature of Zorrilla is prolific. His poetry reaches a zenith with Readings, which are small dramas sung as narration in verse. The most important of these readings are Margarita la Tornera and To a good judge, a better witness. However, his recognition is owed more to his dramatic works. Dramas that stand out include The Shoemaker and the King, about the death of the king don Pedro; Traitor, Confessor, and Martyr, about the famous baker of Madrigal, which came to pass by way of don Sebasti√°n, king of Portugal; Don Juan Tenorio (1844), the most famous of his works, represents a tradition in many Spanish cities at the beginning of November. It discusses the theme of the famous joker of Seville, written about previously by Tirso de Molina (17th century) and other national and foreign authors. = Other authors = Francisco Mart√≠nez de la Rosa, escritor de transici√≥n (Writer of transition) Mart√≠nez de la Rosa (1787‚Äì1862), born in Granada. As a politician, he intervened fervently in the Cortes of C√°diz. Because of his liberal ideals, he suffered the pain of imprisonment. He emigrated to France and was named chief of the government in 1833 on his return to Spain. His politics of \\"right means\\" failed among the extremists on the left and the right. His contemporaries gave him the nickname \\"Rosita la pastelera\\" (Rosita the baker), though he had been imprisoned, exiled and attacked in his fight for a much-desired freedom. His first works are full of neoclassicism, such as La ni√±a en casa y la madre en la m√°scara (\\"The girl in the house and the mother in the mask\\"). Later, as he began to practice \\"right means\\", adopting the new, latent aesthetic, he wrote his most important works: Aben Humeya y La conjuraci√≥n de Venecia (\\"The conspiracy of Venice\\"). Antonio Garc√≠a Guti√©rrez Guti√©rrez was born in Chiclana, C√°diz, in 1813 and died in Madrid, in 1884. From an artisan family, he dedicated himself to words and, short on resources, enlisted in the army. In 1836 he released El trovador (\\"The troubador\\"), a work which evoked an enthusiastic response from the public, though it obligated him to bid farewell to his current situation, instituting in Spain an effective custom from France. Thanks to his success he could rise above the economic difficulties with which he lived. On the explosion of the \\"Gloriosa\\", he joined with the revolutionaries, with a hymn against the Borbones that became very popular. Juan Eugenio Hartzenbusch Hartzenbusch was born and died in Madrid (1806‚Äì1880). Son of a German cabinetmaker and an Analucian mother, he dedicated himself at first to his father's profession, but later consecrated himself to the theatre, where he obtained rotund success with his most famous work, Los amantes de Teruel (\\"The lovers of Teruel\\") (1837). He continued to publish stories, poems and custombrist articles. Manuel Bret√≥n de los Herreros Herreros was born in Quel, Logro√±o, in 1796 and died in Madrid, in 1873. He accepted his literary fate at a very young age, with works like A la vejez viruelas (\\"To the ancient smallpox\\"), Mu√©rete y ver√°s (\\"Die and you will see\\") and El pelo de la dehesa (\\"The hair of the grove\\"). He satirized Romanticism, though some of its characteristics appear in his comedies, as in Mu√©rete y ver√°s.  Postromanticism  During the second half of the nineteenth century, the movement's pre-existing interests in history and legend entered a new stage, and poetry became more sentimental and intimate. This change was due to the influence of German poetry and a renewed popular interest in Spanish poetry. The Postromantic school departed significantly from its other European contemporaries, with the exception of Heinrich Heine's German poetry. Poetry continued to be Romantic, while prose and theater adhered more to Realism. Romantic poetry slowly lost some of its popularity due to its concentration on emotive forces. Narration declined in favor of lyricism, and poems became more personal and intimate. Rhetoric became more scarce as lyricism increased, and common themes were love and passion for the world in all of its beauty. Romantics began to experiment with new metric forms and rhythms. The homogeneity that the Romance movement enjoyed was transformed into a plurality of poetic ideas. In sum, post-Romanticism represented a transition between the Romanticism and Realism. The most well- known poets of this period were Gustavo Adolfo B√©cquer, Augusto Ferr√°n, and Rosal√≠a de Castro. They were not particularly well received in their contemporary society, the utilitarian and unidealistic Restoration, and were admired much less than writers who chose contemporary social themes like Ram√≥n de Campoamor and Gaspar N√∫√±ez de Arce, though the latters have little critical relevance. = Gustavo Adolfo B√©cquer = Gustavo Adolfo B√©cquer Born in Seville in 1836, B√©cquer was orphaned and raised by his godmother. He dreamed of becoming a sailor but found his calling as a writer. At 18 years of age he moved to Madrid where he suffered hardships while trying to achieve literary success. At 21 he contracted tuberculosis which would eventually carry him to the grave. He fell desperately in love with Elisa Guill√©n, and she returned his affections, but the couple soon separated in a taxing process for the poet. In 1861 he married Casta Esteban and worked as a columnist with a politically conservative slant. He later secured a monthly income of 500 pesetas (a large sum for the time) while working as a novel critic, but he lost the job in the revolution of 1868. He separated from his not-so-faithful wife, became disillusioned and lived a dirty and Bohemian lifestyle. In 1870 his inseparable companion and brother Valeriano died. B√©cquer reconciled with Casta but died months later in 1870 in Madrid and was buried along with his brother in Seville. B√©cquer's prose work is contained within Leyendas, a work of twenty-one stories that are dominated by themes of mystery and the afterlife in true Romantic fashion. He also wrote Cartas desde mi celda, a collection of chronicles composed during his stay at the Veruela monastery. In a similar manner, all of B√©cquer's poetry is collected in Rimas. The 79 poems are short, have 2,3, or 4 stanzas (with rare exceptions), generally employ assonant rhyme, and are written in free verse. = Rosal√≠a de Castro = Born in Santiago de Compostela in 1837, de Castro was the bastard child of unmarried lovers, a fact that caused an incurable bitterness in her. While living in Madrid she met and later married the Galician historian Manuel Murgu√≠a. The couple lived in various places throughout Castile, but Rosal√≠a never felt tied to the region and ultimately managed to settle the family in Galicia. The marriage was not happy and the couple underwent economic hardship as they raised six children. She died of cancer in Iria Flavia in 1885, and her remains were buried at Santiago de Compostela, a suitable site for a lover of Galicia. Though de Castro was not prolific in prose, she achieved notoriety with El caballero de las botas azules (The blue-booted cavalier) which had a philosophical and satirical bent. She is mostly recognized for her poetic contributions to Spanish literature. Her first books, La flor (The Flower, 1857) and A mi madre (To My Mother, 1863) possess some Romantic characteristics with Esproncedian verses. Her three most memorable works are: *Cantares gallegos: This work was developed during Rosal√≠a's stay in Castile while she longer for her homeland of Galicia. In Castile she felt like an exile because, according to her, there was little respect things Galician. Cantares gallegos was a work of simple poems with popular themes and rhythms. She felt nostalgia for her homeland and desired to return: > ::Airi√±os, airi√±os aires, ::airi√±os da mi√±a terra; ::airi√±os, airi√±os aires, > ::airi√±os, levaime a ela. :She also vented her anger toward Castile, which she considered an exploiter of the poor laboring Galicians: > ::Premita Dios, castellanos, ::castellanos que aborrezco, ::qu'antes os > gallegos morran ::qu'ir a pedirvos sustento. *Follas novas (New leaves): In the prologue of this work, Rosal√≠a explains that her book is the product of pain and disappointment. She does not sing of the physical Galicia in these poems, but rather of her own suffering and the suffering of Galician people. She also deals with ubi sunt, in which she expresses her regret and anger over being stripped of happiness and past illusions. > ::Aquelas risas sin fin, ::aquel brincar sin dolor, ::aquela louca alegr√≠a, > ::¬øpor qu√© acab√≥u? *En las orillas del Sar: Many critics consider this work to be the apex of Rosal√≠a's poetry. It is the only one of the three major novels to be written in Castilian Spanish. At the time, it was held in low esteem outside of Galician territory, but the Generation of 98 brought the poems back into the limelight. In Las orillas del Sar she makes confessions about her private life, love and pain, human injustice, faith, death, eternity, etc.  Antiromantic poets  These poets could also be considered adherents of Realism, given the decline of the Romantic movement and their contrary posture toward it. = Ram√≥n de Campoamor = (Navia, Asturias, 1817-Madrid, 1901), an ideological moderate, was a governor and parliamentarian. In his book Po√©tica, he stated his intention to arrive at an \\"art of ideas\\". In this way, a poem would have a clearly defined argument. He also tried to fulfill such ideas in the Humoradas, in the Doloras, and in the Peque√±os poemas. The humoradas (\\"witticisms\\") were short poems written for the albums and fans of his friends. One of them goes: > ::En este mundo traidor ::nada es verdad ni mentira; ::todo es seg√∫n el > color ::del cristal con que se mira. > ::In this treacherous world ::nothing is either truth or lie; ::everything > depends on the color ::of the crystal that one looks through. The doloras had philosophical ambitions, as in ¬°Qui√©n supiera escribir! (Who knew how to write) and El gaitero de Gij√≥n (The piper of Gij√≥n). In Peque√±os poemas, (Short poems), 31 brief compositions, Campoamor describes the trivialities of the soul of woman, as in El tren expreso (The Express Train). Modernist thinking considers Campoamor as a symbol of the anti-poet, because of coarse, banal thinking such as this. = Gaspar N√∫√±ez de Arce = (Valladolid, 1834-Madrid 1903). He was also a governor and parliamentarian, and a minister as well. He wrote the play El haz de le√±a (The bundle of firewood), whose plot deals with the mysterious death of don Carlos, son of King Philip II of Spain. His most notable poetical works are La √∫ltima lamentaci√≥n de lord Byron (The last lamentation of Lord Byron), a long soliloquy on the miseries of the world, the existence of a superior, omnipotent being, politics, etc., and La visi√≥n de Fray Mart√≠n (The vision of Friar Martin), in which N√∫√±ez de Arce portrays Martin Luther contemplating, from a rock, the nations that followed in his wake.

A cash prize is awarded to the winning team.  History  The University of San Francisco International Business Plan Competition was founded in 2003. The founding chair of the contest was Dr. Mark Cannice of the USF School of Business and Management. The Grand Champion of the 1st annual event was Mobius Microsystems, from the University of Michigan. 2004's Competition drew 25 teams from around the world with an equally impressive panel of judges (e.g. Shawn Fanning), and was featured in SF Chronicle in three separate SFChronicle articles. In 2005, it was renamed as the USF-Pacific Specialty Insurance International Business Plan Competition in honor of its largest donor. It was also the first time that the Competition was held in conjunction with the San Francisco-Silicon Valley Global Entrepreneurship Research Conference, and was once again featured on SFChronicle . Judges included Intuit Chairman Bill Campbell, Co-founder of Gordon Biersch Brewing Co. Dan Gordon, and CEO of Pacific Specialty Insurance Mike McGraw. Approximately 90 business plans were submitted from six continents to qualify for the 2006 USF-PSI International Business Plan Competition. 20 were selected for the event held at the Miyako Hotel from March 22 to 25 with the top team automatically qualifying for Moot Corp at UT Austin. By this time, the competition is renowned for its panel of top-notch entrepreneurs and venture capitalists in the Bay Area, and was featured on CNET for the first time . The 2007 USF Contest, held March 25‚Äì28, was considered by many judges and participants as the best event yet with a remarkable panel of judges and slate of contestants, with the winner (a life science proposal) coming again from the Univ. of Illinois at Chicago.

Caffin ca. 1900 'Charles Henry Caffin (June 4, 1854 ‚Äì January 14, 1918) was an Anglo-American writer and art critic, born in Sittingbourne, Kent, England. After graduating from Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1876, with a broad background in culture and aesthetics, he engaged in scholastic and theatrical work. In 1888, he married Caroline Scurfield, a British actress and writer. They had two children, daughters Donna and Freda Caffin. In 1892, he moved to the United States. He worked in the decoration department of the Chicago Exposition, and after moving to New York City in 1897, he was the art critic of Harper's Weekly, the New York Evening Post, the New York Sun' (1901-04), the International Studio, and the New York American. His publications are of a popular rather than a scholarly character, but he was an important early if equivocal advocate of modern art in America. His writings were suggestive and stimulating to laymen and encouraged interest in many fields of art. One of his last books, Art for Life's Sake (1913), described his philosophy, which argued that the arts must be seen as \\"an integral part of life....[not] an orchid-like parasite on life\\" or a specialized or elite indulgence.Charles Caffin. Art for Life's Sake (New York: Prang Co., 1913), p. 18. He also argued strenuously for art education in American elementary schools and high schools and was a frequent lecturer. Career Caffin's earliest writings did not suggest that he would ever be sympathetic to the modernist attack on traditional aesthetic values. His many articles and books, which were surveys intended for a general audience, focused on the major names in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century European painting and sculpture, and when considering art from the late nineteenth century, praised the work of artists like Abbott Thayer and George de Forest Brush, who came to epitomize everything Modernism would reject. He was an admirer of Tonalism and the realism of Gari Melchers. Caffin's interest in pictorial photography led to the most important and productive friendship of his life with Alfred Stieglitz. Stieglitz enlisted Caffin as a writer for his journal Camera Work, for which he wrote appreciations of Stieglitz's photographs as well as those of Edward Steichen, Frank Eugene, Joseph Keiley, and Gertrude Kasebier, among others. Camera Work, which was founded in 1902, continued publication until 1917 and, in the words of Stieglitz's biographer, Caffin was \\"the only major critic sympathetic to [Stieglitz's] goals to last the full life of the magazine.\\"Sue Davidson Lowe, Stieglitz: A Memoir/Biography (New York: Farrar, Straus, Giroux, 1983), p. 122. The relationship with Stieglitz also led to more exposure to new art. Reviewing exhibitions at Stieglitz's gallery, \\"291,\\" Caffin had the opportunity to assess challenging artists as different as Abraham Walkowitz, Alfred Maurer, John Marin, Arthur Dove, and Marsden Hartley. Some of the new art he saw (e.g., Cubism and Synchromism) was confusing and disorienting to him, but much of it was a revelation which he was pleased to discuss in his newspaper and magazine columns. Though he was always more comfortable writing about the Old Masters or painters from his youth like James Abbott McNeill Whistler, he acquired a reputation as a writer with an open mind. He could also acknowledge that his own perspective had changed over time. Examining a portrait by Thomas Wilmer Dewing at a 1916 exhibition at the Knoedler gallery, Caffin wrote, \\"It is with curious reflection that one studies its dead harmonies of color, its inert vibrations...and recalls that they once seemed to awaken a response in one's imagination...Poor old fin-de-si√®cle exquistiveness, how completely everybody but the artist has grown beyond you!\\"New York American, March 13, 1916, p. 12. Caffin had his enemies in the modernist camp who could not forgive him his more conservative tastes. Willard Huntington Wright, an early advocate of abstract painting, found Caffin's growing interest in advanced art suspicious and suggested that hypnotism must be responsible for his conversion to a broader view, as \\"the headmaster in the kindergarten of painting\\" was not clever enough to see the light on his own.Willard Huntington Wright, \\"The Aesthetic Struggle in America,\\" Forum (February 1916), pp. 205 and 209. Another writer in the Stieglitz circle, Temple Scott, wrote an \\"histoire √† clef\\" that offered a particularly unflattering portrait of Caffin, thinly disguised as \\"Charles Cockayne,\\" a critic of complacent self-assurance.Temple Scott, \\"Fifth Avenue and the Boulevard Saint-Michel,\\" Forum (December 1910), pp. 665-685. In the years between the 1913 Armory Show, which he found impressive but dangerously sensationalistic, and his death in 1918, Caffin energetically covered the changing New York art world and urged his readers to give the difficult new painters a chance. He made a case to skeptical viewers for the work of European modernists like Henri Matisse, Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi, and Francis Picabia. Yet he also shared his own doubts. While he could see the innovative qualities of Paul C√©zanne and Georges Braque, he dismissed the \\"pinhead humor\\" of Marcel DuchampNew York American, April 10, 1916, p. 7. and found the Coney Island paintings of Joseph Stella aggressively vulgar.New York American, February 9, 1914, p. 7. Writing about a 1915 Picasso exhibition, he admitted that all artists must follow \\"the inevitable call of their own genius\\" but that Picasso \\"has reached a point of intentional abstraction which I, for one, cannot follow.\\"New York American, March 15, 1915, p. 9. Charles Caffin was neither a reactionary opposed to Modernism nor an unabashed avant- garde supporter. Sharing his enthusiasm and his skepticism, he provided a forum for reasoned debate and applauded the testing of aesthetic boundaries and standards. He understood that he lived in changing times.

The stream drains approximately of the Rogue Valley and discharges an annual average of into the Rogue River. It begins near Emigrant Lake and travels through the municipalities of Ashland, Talent, Phoenix, Medford, and Central Point.  History  Prior to the arrival of settlers in the 1850s, the Bear Creek Valley was home to three Native American tribes; these were the Takelmas, the Latgawas, and the Shastas. The scattered camps hunted deer and elk, fished for salmon, and consumed plums, sunflowers, and root crops. When the area was originally settled, the stream was called Si-ku-ptat by the natives and may have been known as Stewart River by settlers.. For Stewart River, Mr. Gray was referencing a 1925 work by A. L. Kroeber called Handbook of California Indians. For Si-ku-ptat, a 1981 work by J. P. Harrington. An Oregon Department of Environmental Quality report cites \\"Landry\\" for Si'kuptat. Various forced migrations occurred during the 1850s in which almost all of the Native American inhabitants were displaced to Indian Reservations by 1857. Farmers and ranchers continued to acquire land claims, and when the Oregon and California Railroad arrived in 1883, Bear Creek was chosen as the route to follow.  Geology  The Bear Creek watershed is a curved valley (actually part of the Rogue Valley) averaging about wide and long, covering approximately .The width comes from the length of the Bear Creek as cited by the Watershed Assessment and the area measurement. The confluence with the Rogue River is in the northwestern tip of the valley. The highest point in the watershed is on Mount Ashland at an elevation of about . From there at least 83 streams in 21 sub-watersheds share a link with the greater Rogue River Basin. The landscape surrounding the watershed has been carved by tectonic activity leaving steep canyons that are prone to flooding when snow melts in the spring. The slopes are part of the transition zone between volcanic soil and granitic soil covering much of Southern Oregon and Northern California and are prone to significant periods of erosion and runoff during high-flow periods. Furthermore, the elevation of the watershed at the point of confluence is about , and a significant amount of kinetic energy builds up over the first of drop. Historically, the landscape plays a large part in dispersing this energy but flooding has become a regular problem along the Bear Creek; several earlier bridges in the Rogue Valley have been wiped out during random flood events.

It is the host wing at Joint Base Andrews Naval Air Facility, Maryland. As host wing, the 316 WG operates, administers and maintains the base. The 316th Wing was activated on June 11, 2020, becoming the host wing for JBA and taking on the Airmen and units of the 11th Wing. The wing's Operations Group was a highly decorated C-47 Skytrain unit that served with Ninth Air Force and Twelfth Air Force in the European Theater of Operations and the Mediterranean theaters during World War II. The wing's officially stated mission is \\"Respond, Honor, Defend, Support and Care...to project airpower and diplomacy from America's Airfield\\". Overview As the host wing for Joint Base Andrews, Md., the 316th Wing is responsible for maintaining emergency reaction rotary-wing airlift and other National Capital Region contingency response capabilities critical to national security and for organizing, training, equipping and deploying combat-ready forces for Air and Space Expeditionary Forces (AEFs). The 316th Wing also provides installation security, services and airfield management to support the President, Vice President, other U.S. senior leaders and more than 50 tenant organizations and federal agencies. The 316th Wing provides security, personnel, contracting, finance and infrastructure support for 5 Wings, 3 Headquarters, more than 80 tenant organizations, 148 geographically separated units, 6,500 Airmen in the Pentagon, as well as 60,000 Airmen and families in the national capital region and around the world. The 316th Wing supports contingency operations in our nation's capital with immediate response rotary-assets. It also provides security for the world's highest visibility flight line and is responsible for ceremonial support with the United States Air Force Band, Honor Guard and Air Force Arlington Chaplaincy. The commander of the 316th Wing is Colonel TYLER R. SCHAFF. Its Command Chief Master Sergeant is Chief Master Sergeant THOMAS C. DANIELS. History The wing was originally established as the 316th Troop Carrier Wing in 1947 at the former Greeneville AFB, SC, primarily operating the C-47 and C-82. It was subsequently inactivated in 1949. In 1966, the unit was reactivated at Langley AFB, VA as the 316th Tactical Airlift Wing (316 TAW) of the Tactical Air Command (TAC). The 316 TAW conducted C-130 replacement training from January 1966 to November 1967 and C-130 maintenance training from February to December 1966. In late 1967, the 316 TAW relinquished its training mission and became a typical operational tactical airlift wing with the C-130E Hercules. As an operational wing, the organization operated three tactical airlift squadrons in addition to its various maintenance and support squadrons. The 316 TAW participated in joint airborne training, glider training, exercises maneuvers, and ferried freight in the United States and overseas. It also participated in worldwide tactical airlift operations, humanitarian missions, and special exercises and maneuvers, including joint airborne training. In 1973, the wing also participated in repatriation of South Vietnamese and American prisoners of war from North Vietnam. In 1975, all tactical airlift assets in TAC were transferred to the Military Airlift Command (MAC). With TAC Headquarters being at Langley AFB, and with the pending arrival of the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing (1 TFW) and the first operational F-15A Eagles at Langley, MAC and TAC agreed to inactivate the 316 TAW and two of its three tactical airlift squadrons. All of the wing's C-130 aircraft assets were redistributed to other C-130 wings with the exception of the 36th Tactical Airlift Squadron (36 TAS), now known as the 36th Airlift Squadron, which was reassigned with its personnel and C-130E aircraft to the 62nd Military Airlift Wing (62 MAW), now known as the 62nd Airlift Wing (62 AW), a then-C-141 Starlifter strategic airlift wing at McChord AFB, WA in the summer of 1975. From 1980‚Äì1991, the 1776th Air Base Wing (1776 ABW) was the host wing that operated, administered and maintained Andrews AFB, MD for all its tenant commands. The 1776 ABW wing was consolidated with the newly established 316th Wing (316 WG) on 21 June 2006. In addition to base operations and support of Andrews AFB, the 316 WG also operated UH-1N Twin Huey aircraft for quick-reaction rotary-wing airlift in the National Capital Region. Upon the recommendation of Base Realignment and Closure, 2005, the 11th Wing of Bolling Air Force Base merged with the 316th Wing and was redesignated the 11th Wing at Joint Base Andrews Naval Air Facility.Mission, movement, manning ‚Äì installation members stand at ready for 11 WG merger United States Air Force In June 2020, the Air Force and Navy agreed to transfer control of Joint Base Anacostia Bolling from the Navy to the Air Force, based on the predominance of Air Force 'mission sets\\" at the joint base. in connection with this transfer, the 11th Wing moved to Anacostia Bolling to assume responsibilities there.

She was one of eight Russian pre-dreadnought battleships captured by the Imperial Japanese Navy from the Russians during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905. She subsequently served in the Japanese Navy under the name until sunk as a target in 1936. In Russian service Initially assigned to the Russian Baltic Fleet, she was later reclassed as a coastal defence ship. The three obsolete Ushakovs (, , and Admiral Senyavin) were rejected for inclusion in the Second Pacific Squadron assembled by Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky to reinforce the existing Russian squadron based at Port Arthur after the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War as Rozhestvensky felt they were unsuitable for such an extreme blue-water operation.Captain Peter Hore, Battleships, p. 115. Nevertheless, all three were selected to form part of Admiral Nebogatov's Third Pacific Squadron which was subsequently sent out to reinforce Rozhestvensky on his journey to the Far East after political agitation following his departure. This Third Pacific Squadron transited the Suez Canal and the two Russian squadrons rendezvoused at Cam Ranh Bay after a cruise that became known as the \\"Voyage of the Damned\\", and from there Rozhestvensky set course through the South China Sea towards the Korea Strait, where they were discovered by the Japanese. At the resulting Battle of Tsushima (27‚Äì28 May 1905), the three ships survived the first phase of the engagement on the evening of 27 May largely due to the Japanese concentrating their efforts on Rozhestvensky's modern battleships (concentrated in the First and Second Divisions of the Russian squadron) and their subsequent almost- total destruction left the Russian fleet in tatters. Nebogatov's Third Division was largely able to keep itself together during the night, although Admiral Seniavins sister ship Admiral Ushakov strayed from formation and was sunk by the Japanese. The morning of 28 May found the Russian survivors surrounded by an apparently undamaged Japanese force, and Nebogatov surrendered. Thus Admiral Seniavin and General Admiral Graf Apraksin were captured as prizes of war.Eric Grove, Big Fleet Actions, pp. 29-45. Japanese service General Admiral Graf Apraxin was commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Navy under the name Okinoshima and Admiral Seniavin became the second-class coastal defense vessel Mishima. Mishima was named for the small island of Mishima, offshore from Hagi in Yamaguchi prefecture, not far from the location of the Battle of Tsushima. Mishima retained her original four 10-inch 45 caliber guns, six 6-inch 40 caliber Armstrong Z guns and two 47 mm guns. Mishima was part of the Japanese Second Fleet in World War I, participating in the Battle of Tsingtao against the small number of Imperial German Navy ships left behind by Admiral von Spee's East Asia Squadron. After the end of the war, Mishima supported the Japanese Siberian Intervention against the Bolshevik Red Army in eastern Russia by covering the landings of Japanese forces, and by acting as an icebreaker to keep the sea lanes between Japan and Vladivostok open. On 1 April 1921, Mishima was re-classified as a submarine tender. Mishima was decommissioned on 10 October 1935. She was expended as a gunnery target and sunk in September 1936 off Kushima, Miyazaki.

It is a form of yield management in that the limits can be changed to optimize the profit from a gaming table. Gaming tables have a limited resource to sell: the seats used by the players.  Minimum table limits  Table limits can also be used to manage, in a limited manner, who plays at tables. A casino that wants to project a more exclusive image can set the limits higher so that the casual player walking through would not be as likely to sit down and play. Also games with a lower house edge often have a higher minimum bet. Baccarat almost always has a high minimum bet since the house edge is relatively low. Often a casino will advertise a low minimum game as a teaser, a sign might read $2 blackjack 24 hours a day. However, the $2 minimum game might be available at only one table and the payout might be 6:5 for a blackjack. Historically the attitude has changed about table limits. In the early 1990s in downtown Vegas, quarter minimum bets were common. The low minimums created a general excitement in the casinos as hundreds of people would jostle to play table games. However, casinos floors generally had twice as many employees as they do today. It also made it much easier to introduce new gamblers to table games. Most casinos today would prefer that the low rollers play slot machines which do not require as much oversight. Normally the limits are set to optimize the return from the seats. Since all table games give the house an advantage, the larger the bets, the larger the house's profit, so the house needs to manage the minimum bets to keep the seats full. This usually results in a low limit early in the day when there are fewer players with the limits increasing as more players become available. Players who are seated when the limit is changed are usually grandfathered in at the old limit. In some casinos they retain the old limit until they leave, in others the lower limit will last for a limited period of time. Casinos are increasingly turning towards expensive virtual gaming tables to offer low minimum table limit games to customers. Although electronic versions of table games like blackjack have been available for years, they typically raise the house edge by paying even money on blackjack to handle the very low table limits. The more expensive virtual games with high definition video simulations of real dealers pay normal 3:2 payouts, but still include some limitations like limiting the player from doubling soft combinations. Since the electronic machines are available 24/7 and do not require a paid dealer, they are popular ways to augment the gaming pit.  High table limits  Table maximums can be as low as $50 at the small locals casino Poker Palace, but major strip casinos usually offer some tables with a $10,000 maximum. Exceptions are the Golden Nugget in downtown which permits $15,000 bets, and three tables at Caesars Palace which permit bets between $5,000 and $50,000.Wizardofvegas.com: Las Vegas Blackjack Survey High table limits have their own requirements. For instance as of the year ending September 2009, the 231 blackjack tables in downtown Las Vegas earn an average of $531 per day and the 36 craps table earn an average of $2258 per day in gross revenue before expenses. Although the house has a statistical edge on the expected return, the casino has no control over variance. The outcome of a small number of players making huge bets is unpredictable. The casino could make record profits, or the players could wipe out the cash in the casino or eliminate the profit for the month. Maximum table limits prevent the casino from taking too much of a gamble. For a small casino table maximums are set at $100‚Äì$500 per bet. The larger casino can afford larger maximums. Tim Poster and Tom Breitling purchased the Golden Nugget casino in downtown Vegas in January 2004. Although they personally invested $50 million of their own money in the project, they did not have the deep pockets of a major corporation. In order to create the ambiance of Old Vegas, and to attract the high rollers to the aging casino, they elected to work with lower house edges and high table limits. The strategy worked for around 9 months until a high roller won $8.5 million over a two-week period and wiped out their profit for a year. The owners elected to return to table limits to something less risky. After selling the casino to Landry's Restaurant Tom Breitling wrote a book entitled Double or Nothing about running a high risk business. High rollers are usually handled by the largest corporations with revenues of several billion dollars a year. The corporations can handle large quarterly variations in profits. In the 21st century Las Vegas changed their policy established in 1931 that all gaming should be public. They permitted small clubs to be opened strictly for high rollers. The Paiza Club in the Palazzo hotel requires that players have at least $300,000 of credit or on front money deposit to play. Live feeds directly to the State Gaming Commission are a requirement. A table or a game without a limit is commonly referred to as no-limit. These tables generally allow the player to bet as much as they wish. This is a common form of Texas hold 'em in tournament play where the size of the bets are limited by the chips in play or cash games where the bet is limited by the size of the 'buy in' or chips one has accumulated prior to the current hand. No-limit can be a somewhat deceptive term, however, as one may not bring more money to the table once a hand has started or place a bet for more than the total amount that one has in play when the hands starts. There is a widely held belief that casinos instituted maximum table limits to limit Martingale betting strategies. The simplest of these strategies involves a player doubling his or her bet every time a loss is incurred on a bet with even odds, until he or she wins. In reality casinos are not at risk from Martingale players. They are at risk against the lucky player who is betting an amount that would be proportionately high for that particular business. It is considered that the number of high and low limit tables are unique to each casino. For example, in Las Vegas Neighborhood and Downtown casinos usually have lower limit tables than Strip casinos. Locals point, that The El Cortez on Fremont Street has plenty of low-limit games, plus blackjack from a single or double-deck shoe.

He served as an alderman in the Metro Toronto municipality of North York from 1978 to 1985, and later campaigned for Mayor of North York in 1988. He has also sought election to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Foster is a member of the New Democratic Party (NDP). Early life and career Foster studying political science at York University. Before entering political life, he worked in community service, produced a television problem on community affairs, and was the administrator of a legal aid clinic. In June 1978, he was listed as a worker at Etobicoke's Welfare Action Centre.Olga Cyhanenko, \\"Overcharged senior citizens on rents, housing authority won't give refunds\\", Globe and Mail, 20 June 1978, P5. Foster represented the senior citizen in question. North York councillor Foster was first elected to North York's city council in 1978 via a narrow victory over incumbent alderman Marilyn Meshburg, who had defeated him in his first attempt two years earlier. Foster's challenge of Meshburg was somewhat unusual, in that both candidates were progressives on labour issues and other matters. Meshburg was supported by the Metro Reform citizens' group, while Foster was backed by the municipal wing of the NDP and the Metro Labour Council.James Jefferson, \\"Taxes, performance of aldermen emerge as main issues in close North York fights\\", Globe and Mail, 11 November 1978, P4. He was twenty-four years old at the time of the election. Following his election, Foster sought to remove a legal loophole which allowed oil companies to pay lower taxes by classifying their property as farmland.Marina Strauss, \\"560 gardeners in North York seek tax break given oil firms\\", Globe and Mail, 6 January 1981, P5; \\"Imperial Oil drops farm-tax loophole\\", Globe and Mail, 5 December 1981, P4. In 1984, he called on the provincial government to forbid companies from charging user fees for Workers Compensation Board cases.\\"More private firms advise workers in WCB cases, legal officials says\\" (sic), Globe and Mail, 13 April 1984, M2. Along with Howard Moscoe and Barbara Greene, Foster was considered a leading voice for reform on council and frequently criticized the development policies of Mayor Mel Lastman.John Sewell, \\"Ample scope for reform\\", Globe and Mail, 2 January 1985, M1; John Sewell, \\"Strange, but true\\", Globe and Mail, 15 February 1985, M1. He remained an alderman until 1985, when he unsuccessfully sought election to the city's Board of Control. He also campaigned for the Ontario legislature in the 1985 provincial election, and finished second in Yorkview against Claudio Polsinelli. During his provincial campaign, Foster called for tenant protection, job creation and comprehensive workers compensation reforms.Margaret Polanyi, \\"NDP, Liberals in scrap over Yorkview riding\\", Globe and Mail, 4 April 1985, M4. Since 1985 After leaving North York council, Foster became a partner in Union Communications, an advertising and communications agency that specializes in progressive issues. He also worked as a Toronto Star columnist for two years, writing on political issues. In one 1986 article, he called on North York to adopt progressive housing policies.Mike Foster, \\"It's time to act on North York housing policy\\", Toronto Star, 22 April 1986, N4.

She was named after General Admiral Fyodor Matveyevich Apraksin, the first commander of Russian Baltic Fleet. She was one of eight Russian pre-dreadnought battleships captured by the Imperial Japanese Navy during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905. She subsequently served in the Japanese Navy as until removed from service in 1922. She had only three guns (a single gun turret aft, as shown in the photograph), instead of her sister ships, which were equipped with four guns. Russian service In November 1899, shortly after entering service with the Baltic Fleet, General-Admiral Apraksin ran aground on Hogland Island in the Gulf of Finland. It was hoped that she could be salvaged, as a similar incident in 1897 had cost the Russian Navy another battleship, . General- Admiral Apraksins crew were ordered to remain aboard to maintain the ship as best they could when the Gulf froze over for the winter. On the recommendation of radio pioneer A.S. Popov the ship's crew established a radio station on the island to maintain communication with the fleet's headquarters at Kronstadt (via a station at Kymi) in January 1900, after several weeks' delay. Meanwhile, Rear-Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky was assigned to lead the salvage operations. The results of the grounding were such that attempting to tow General-Admiral Apraksin free would likely leave her irreparable and in danger of foundering, and instead Rozhestvensky employed a civilian mining corporation to remove the rocks holding General-Admiral Apraksin with small explosive charges. Assisting the salvage efforts was the icebreaker . Rozhestvensky initially had doubts as to the usefulness of Yermak, but she proved her value during the operation, which was successfully concluded in the first part of May. After General-Admiral Apraksin was freed she was towed back to Kronstadt for the necessary repairs.Constantine Pleshakov, The Tsar's Last Armada, pp. 50-51. Later, General-Admiral Apraksin and her two sister ships, and the were reclassed as coastal defence ships. The Russo-Japanese War The three Ushakovs were rejected for inclusion in the Second Pacific Squadron assembled by Admiral Rozhestvensky to reinforce the existing Russian squadron based at Port Arthur after the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War as Rozhestvensky felt they were unsuitable for such an extreme blue-water operation.Captain Peter Hore, Battleships, p. 115. Nevertheless, all three were selected to form part of Admiral Nebogatov's Third Pacific Squadron which was subsequently sent out to reinforce Rozhestvensky on his journey to the Far East after political agitation following his departure. The two Russian squadrons finally met and united at Cam Ranh Bay after a cruise that became known as the \\"Voyage of the Damned\\", and from there Rozhestvensky set course through the South China Sea towards the Korea Strait, where they were discovered by the Japanese. At the resulting Battle of Tsushima (27‚Äì28 May 1905), the three ships survived the first phase of the engagement on the evening of 27 May largely due to the Japanese concentrating their efforts on Rozhestvensky's modern battleships (concentrated in the First and Second Divisions of the Russian squadron) and their subsequent almost-total destruction left the Russian fleet in tatters. Nebogatov's Third Division was largely able to keep itself together during the night, although Apraksins sister ship Admiral Ushakov strayed from formation and was sunk by Japanese torpedoes. The morning of 28 May found the Russian survivors surrounded by an apparently undamaged Japanese force, and Nebogatov surrendered. Thus Apraksin and Admiral Seniavin were captured as prizes of war.Eric Grove, Big Fleet Actions, pp. 29-45. Japanese service Okinoshima Admiral Senyavin became Mishima and General-Admiral Apraksin was commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Navy as the 2nd class coastal defense vessel Okinoshima. Okinoshima was named for the small island of Munakata, Fukuoka Prefecture, which is the site of a famous Shinto shrine, and which is also geographically close to the location of the Battle of Tsushima. Okinoshima retained her original three 10-inch 45 caliber guns, six 6-inch 40 caliber Armstrong Z guns and two 47mm guns. Okinoshima was part of the Japanese Second Fleet at the outbreak of the First World War, participating in the Battle of Tsingtao against the small number of German ships left behind by Admiral von Spee's East Asia Squadron. On 1 April 1921, Okinoshima was re-classified as a submarine tender. Okinoshima was decommissioned on 1 April 1922 and was sold as scrap in 1924 to a private firm, which transformed her into a memorial ship located at Tsuyazaki, Fukuoka, commemorating the Japanese victory at the Battle of Tsushima. The memorial ship was severely damaged in storms in 1939, and scrapped shortly thereafter. The battleship Okinoshima should not be confused with the Pacific War era minelayer of the same name.

Life Matthew Maty, in his M√©moire sur la vie et sur les √©crits de M. A. de Moivre, wrote that Dodson was a pupil of Abraham de Moivre. He worked as an accountant and teacher. In 1752 George Parker, 2nd Earl of Macclesfield, a friend of Dodson, became President of the Royal Society, and Dodson was elected a Fellow on 16 January 1755. On 7 August of the same year he was elected master of the Royal Mathematical School, Christ's Hospital, and also of Stone's School there. Dodson died 23 November 1757, being then over fifty-two years of age. He lived at Bell Dock, Wapping. Actuarial legacy Having been refused admission to the Amicable Life Assurance Society, because they took no one over 45, he decided to form a new society on a plan of assurance that would be more \\"equitable\\". Dodson built on the statistical mortality tables developed by Edmund Halley in 1693. Equitable Life, as it was to be, charged premiums aimed at correctly offsetting the risks of long term life assurance policies. But Dodson made only unsuccessful attempts to procure a charter. The Equitable Life Assurance Society was founded in 1762 to put the actuarial principles that Dodson had developed over the previous decade into practice, by a group of mathematicians and others including Edward Rowe Mores. Works thumb As a mathematician Dodson is known mainly for his work on The Anti-Logarithmic Canon and The Mathematical Miscellany. In 1742 Dodson published The Anti-Logarithmic Canon. Being a table of numbers consisting of eleven places of figures, corresponding to all Logarithms under 100,000, with an Introduction containing a short account of Logarithms. This was a unique tabulation until 1849. The canon had been actually calculated, it is said, by Walter Warner and John Pell, in the period 1630 to 1640. Its provenance was that Warner had left it to Herbert Thorndike, at whose death it came to Richard Busby, and finally was bought for the Royal Society; but for some years it had been lost. In a letter of Pell's, 7 August 1644, written to Sir Charles Cavendish, it is said that Warner became bankrupt, and Pell surmises that the manuscript would be destroyed by the creditors in ignorance. In 1747 Dodson published The Calculator ‚Ä¶ adapted to Science, Business, and Pleasure. It is a large collection of small tables, with some seven-figure logarithms. This he dedicated to William Jones. The same year he started the publication of The Mathematical Miscellany, containing analytical and algebraic solutions of a large number of problems in various branches of mathematics. His preface to vol. i is dated 14 January 1747, the title giving 1748. This volume is dedicated to Abraham de Moivre, and a second edition was issued by his publisher in 1775. Vol. ii (1753) is dedicated to David Papillon, and contains a contribution by de Moivre. Vol. iii (1755) he dedicated to Macclesfield and the Royal Society. This volume is devoted to problems relating to annuities, reversions, insurances, leases on lives, etc.. His Accountant, or a Method of Book-keeping, was published 1750, with a dedication to Macclesfield. In 1751 he edited Edmund Wingate's Arithmetic, which had previously been edited by John Kersey and then by George Shelley. Another work, An Account of the Methods used to describe Lines on Dr. Halley's Chart of the terraqueous Globe, showing the variation of the magnetic needle about the year 1756 in all the known seas, &c.; By Wm. Mountaine and James Dodson, about isogons, was published in 1758, after Dodson's death. Family His three children were left unprovided for. At a meeting of the general court holden in Christ's Hospital 15 December 1757 a petition was read from William Mountaine, where it was stated that Dodson died 'in very mean circumstances, leaving three motherless children unprovided for, viz. James, aged 15, Thomas, aged 11 and three-quarters, and Elizabeth, aged 8.' The two youngest were admitted into the hospital. After the Equitable Society had started, and fifteen years or more after Dodson's death, a resolution was put in the minutes for giving ¬£300 to the children of Dodson, as a recompense for the 'Tables of Lives' which their father had prepared for the society. Dodson's eldest son, James the younger (maternal grandfather of Augustus De Morgan), succeeded to the actuaryship of the society in 1764, but in 1767 left for the custom house.

His recruitment to the SVR appears to have occurred in the wake of a much publicized arrest of senior CIA officer and Moscow mole Aldrich Ames in February 1994 which, in the words of CIA veteran and author Tennent Bagley, had \\"exposed extraordinary slackness of CIA security procedures.\\"Tennent H. Bagley. Shedding Light on Cold War Mysteries. Wall Street Journal Europe, March 7, 1994. Biography Harold James \\"Jim\\" Nicholson joined the CIA in October 1980, after having served as captain in a US Army intelligence unit. In his career with the CIA, Nicholson was assigned duties throughout the world. He worked for the CIA as an operations officer specializing in intelligence operations against foreign intelligence services, including the intelligence services of the USSR and later, the Russian Federation. From 1982 to 1985, he worked for the CIA in Manila, where he had direct contacts with targeted Soviet officials; from 1985 to 1987 he worked for the CIA in Bangkok, from 1987 to 1989 in Tokyo. From 1990 to 1992, he was the CIA Chief of Station in Bucharest, Romania. From 1992 to 1994, Nicholson was the Deputy Chief of Station/Operations Officer in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where he met with and targeted recruitment of Russian intelligence officers. From 1994 to July 1996, Nicholson worked as an instructor at the classified CIA's Special Training Center at Camp Peary, Virginia (also known as \\"The Farm\\"), teaching CIA trainees intelligence tradecraft. In July 1996, he was assigned as a branch chief in the Counterterrorism Center, Directorate of Operations, at CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia. That position carried a pay grade of GS-15, his salary being approximately US$73,000. Despite Nicholson's career success, his personal life had suffered, as his constant assignments weighed heavily on his wife and three children, eventually leading to a divorce. Espionage against the United States, FBI investigation and convictions An FBI affidavit submitted at Nicholson's first espionage trial suggests that, while in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia during 1992‚Äì1994, as Deputy Chief of Station/Operations Officer, Nicholson might have been recruited by the Russian intelligence service (SVR) while meeting with an officer of the Russian intelligence service in Kuala Lumpur on four occasions during his final months there; three of those meetings took place in the Russian Embassy in Kuala Lumpur. Those meetings were authorized by the CIA and reported by Nicholson. On June 30, 1994, one day after his last reported meeting with the SVR officer, financial records showed that $12,000 was wired into Nicholson's savings account at Selco Credit Union in Eugene, Oregon; the FBI was unable to trace this money to any legitimate source of income. Nicholson later admitted to providing the Russian intelligence service with national defense information, including photographic negatives, between June 1994 and his arrest on November 16, 1996. The FBI affidavit implies that the investigation of Nicholson's espionage for Russia was triggered following his failure of three polygraph examinations administered by CIA polygraphers as part of his routine security update in October and December 1995, when questions \\"Have you had unauthorized contact with a Foreign Intelligence Service?\\", \\"Since 1990, have you had contact with a Foreign Intelligence Service that you are trying to hide from the CIA?\\" revealed a high probability of deception or were marked as \\"inconclusive\\". The CIA examiner noted that Nicholson appeared to be trying to manipulate the test by taking deep breaths on the control questions, which he stopped after a verbal warning. Another piece of information that linked Nicholson to his activities was that a Russian mole inside the FSB had informed the CIA that a top priority for Russian intelligence was to gather information on activities and movements of Chechen rebels. While an instructor at Langley, Nicholson had gone to CIA Headquarters and asked several CIA employees in the European section about information on Chechnya. Nicholson claimed the need to know was for an upcoming exercise with students. According to Langley leadership, there were no lessons on Chechen separatism. Requests for changes to the training program needed to be brought before a board of review, and Nicholson did not submit any proposed changes. Nicholson was then placed under surveillance by the FBI. Nicholson was watched during his travels to Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore. During his time in Singapore, surveillance saw him get in a car registered to the Russian embassy. This meeting with Russian nationals was not authorized, nor did Nicholson report it to the CIA as required. Following this meeting, Nicholson returned to the United States where he was seen making a large cash deposit into his bank account, with which he both retired an outstanding car loan and transferred the remainder into three joint accounts that he held with his children. The FBI was unable to trace this cash to any legal source of income. The CIA assigned Nicholson to a management position in the counterterrorism branch at CIA Headquarters, while keeping a close eye on him. The CIA limited his access to information on Russian matters and Chechnya in particular, which were the primary subjects of interest to his Russian handlers. The FBI also retrieved mail sent from Nicholson to his handlers from local public mailboxes, where he signed postcards under the alias \\"Nevil R. Strachey.\\" One such postcard had code words requesting a meeting with the SVR in Switzerland in November 1996. That same month he was scheduled to travel to Europe on official CIA business to meet with European intelligence officers. Nicholson told the CIA he planned to take a personal vacation to Zurich afterwards. On November 16, 1996, the FBI arrested Nicholson at Dulles International Airport. He had a ticket to Zurich, a bundle of exposed film and a computer disk bearing classified information from CIA files. Nicholson was convicted of selling US intelligence to Russia for $300,000 and was sentenced to 23 years 7 months of imprisonment on June 5, 1997. He did not get a life without parole or death sentence as prosecutors said he had cooperated fully with them after his arrest. Prosecutors believed that he had sold the identities of all US intelligence officers stationed in Russia, as well as the identities of his trainees at the CIA school. He told the court that he had intended for the money he received from the Russians to benefit his children. Although his case received far less publicity than that of Aldrich Ames, and apparently caused less damage to US national security, Nicholson was said to be the highest ranking CIA official ever convicted of spying for a foreign power. In court, Nicholson stated he was inspired to commit espionage by looking at the case of Aldrich Ames, rather than being deterred by it. At the end of 2008, Nicholson's youngest son Nathaniel was arrested; prosecutors said Jim Nicholson had used his son to collect more than $47,000 from Russian officials in Mexico, Peru, and Cyprus for past spy work: between December 2006 and December 2008 Nathaniel had met with representatives of the Russian Federation six times, including twice at a consulate in San Francisco. Jim Nicholson was pulled out of prison to plead in court on charges of conspiracy along with his son. On January 18, 2011, Nicholson was sentenced to eight more years in prison, having pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government and conspiracy to commit money laundering; five other charges had been dropped as part of the plea deal. Nathaniel Nicholson had been sentenced in December 2010 to five years on probation after making a deal with prosecutors to help build the case against his father. Nicholson is currently incarcerated at the United States Penitentiary, Florence ADX, the federal supermax prison in Colorado, and is scheduled for release in 2023.

The species was first described by Caspar Stoll in 1782. Description Male upperside, forewing: velvety jet black; base deep blue, beautifully metallic and shining, measured on the dorsum this colour occupies three-fourths of its length from base, its outer margin then curves upwards just past the apex of the cell, enters into the bases of interspaces 10, 11 and 12 and fills the whole of the cell. Hindwing: costal margin above subcostal vein and vein 7, and dorsal margin narrowly fuscous black, a medial longitudinal pale streak on the former; terminal margin narrowly edged with velvety black, inside which in interspaces 1 and 2 is a slender transverse whitish line, with an elongate irregular transverse black spot above it in interspace 1 and a more obscure similar spot in interspace 2; traces of such spots also are present in some specimens in the anterior interspaces. Cilia of both forewings and hindwings black; filamentous tail at apex of vein 2 black tipped with white. Underside: dark chocolate brown. Forewings and hindwings; transversely crossed by the following very slender white hues all more or less broken into short pieces: Forewing: a short pair one on each side of and parallel to the discocellulars, a pale streak along the discocellulars themselves; a single line in continuation of the outer of the discocellular lines, extends down to vein 1; an upper discal pair of lines that form a more or less catenulated (chain- like) short band extend from the costa to vein 3, the inner line of the two continued to vein 1; two more obscure subterminal and a single terminal line, the area enclosed between the subterminal lines and between them and the terminal line darker in the interspaces, giving the appearance of two obscure subterminal lines of spots edged inwardly and outwardly by white lines. Hindwing: crossed by nine very broken and irregular lines; tracing them from the costa downwards their middle short pieces are found to be shifted outwards and a few are short and not complete, the inner two are posteriorly bent abruptly upwards, the subterminal two are lunular and the terminal line nearly continuous; posteriorly between the subterminal pair of lines in interspace 1 there is a small black spot inwardly edged with dark ochraceous, and in interspace 2a much larger round black spot, both black spots are touched with metallic blue scales. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen black, the shafts of the antennae speckled with white; beneath: palpi, thorax and abdomen narrowly white down the middle. Female. Similar to the male generally but with the following differences: upperside, forewing: ground colour fuscous opaque black, not velvety black, blue basal area more restricted and not so deep a blue nor at all metallic. Hindwing: the black costal and terminal margins very much broader, the blue on the basal area consequently much restricted and of the same shade as the blue on the forewing; terminal margin with a subterminal anteriorly obsolescent series of spots of a shade darker than that of the terminal black area on which they are superposed; these spots posteriorly more or less distinctly encircled with slender lines of bluish white, anteriorly these lines are almost obsolete. Cilia of both forewings and hindwings and the filamentous short tail as in the male. Underside: similar to that of the cf but the ground colour generally paler and duller; the transverse white lines broader and more dearly defined. Antenna, head, thorax and abdomen as in the male. Distribution Peninsular India, but not in the very dry or desert tracts, Sri Lanka, Assam, Nepal, Myanmar, Tenasserim, the Andamans; extending in the Malayan subregion to Australia. Life cycle \\"The larva which we have taken at Karwar in June is hardly distinguishable from that of Catochrysops pandava, Horsfield; it is, however, covered with minute hairs and is generally of an olive-green colour and without the reddish suffusion so generally noticed in C. pandava. The pupa is indistinguishable from that of C. pandava. The larva feeds on Xylia dolabrifornis, and also on the flowers of Butea frondosa.\\" Other food plants noted include Millettia peguensis.Kunte, K.

It is open seasonally.http://molsonmuseums.org The Molson Schoolhouse Museum is a separate museum located in a historic schoolhouse building. Displays include hand tools, household artifacts and photographs. History Molson was founded in 1900 by promoter George B. Meacham, and investor John W. Molson (of the Molson beer brewing family). The mining town's population boomed to 300 that year, and the town had a newspaper, general stores, an attorney, doctor, saloon and hotel. By 1901, as the mining was failing, the population fell to 13 people. When news of a railroad being built in Molson arrived in 1905, the population rose again. J.H. McDonald filed for a homestead including much of the town of Molson. In 1909 McDonald enforced his homestead by publishing a notice that everyone on the property was required to depart. Citizens then founded New Molson, ¬Ω mile north of the site of Old Molson. This is also possibly the location of Molson, Okanogan County, Washington that was incorporated on February 13, 1920. It was then disincorporated on 6 October 1921 by order of the Washington State Supreme Court, as the incorporation was declared invalid.

It was directed by Ishir≈ç Honda and written by Ted Sherdeman, based on his radio serial of the same name. The film stars both American and Japanese actors including Joseph Cotten, Cesar Romero, Akira Takarada, Masumi Okada, Richard Jaeckel, Patricia Medina, and Akihiko Hirata. Plot Three men - Dr. Ken Tashiro, Dr. Jules Masson, and journalist Perry Lawton - are trapped in a bathysphere due to seismic activity. They are rescued by the crew of the supersubmarine Alpha, captained by Craig McKenzie (Cotten), who they learn is over 200 years old (and that the Alpha was launched in the early 19th century). McKenzie takes them to Latitude Zero to heal Dr. Masson's injuries. Along the way, they are attacked by a rival supersubmarine, the Black Shark, captained by Kuroi (Hikaru Kuroki), who works for a rival of McKenzie's, Dr. Malic (Romero). Using super-technology, McKenzie gives the Black Shark the slip. The crew of the Alpha soon return to Latitude Zero, a super-advanced utopia hidden fifteen miles below sea level at the intersection of the Equator and the International Date Line populated by people from all over the world reported missing in accidents at sea. It has existed since the 19th century, as none of its inhabitants age or die, and greed and political divisions plaguing the surface world are unknown here. It also surreptitiously assists mankind's technological and cultural advancement. Malic, however, wishes to destroy Latitude Zero using superweapons and artificially grafted monstrosities like giant rats and anthropomorphic bats. He kidnaps a Japanese physicist allied with McKenzie, Dr. Okada, and his daughter Tsuruko, and forces Okada to assist him in his schemes. Moreover, after a cruel experiment grafting the wings of an eagle to a lion, he removes Kuroi's brain and places it in the creature as punishment for her failures. Upon receiving an emergency signal from Okada, McKenzie organizes a rescue expedition, and Tashiro, Masson and Lawton, as well as Latitude Zero physician Dr. Anne Barton (Haynes) and K≈çbo (≈åmae), volunteer to help. Equipped with James Bond-style devices and rendered resistant to physical harm by a special bath, they infiltrate Malic's island base, Blood Rock, fight their way to the enemy control center, and rescue the Okadas. As the team escapes, Malic enters the Black Shark and fires an onboard laser at them. Just then however, Kuroi turns against Malic and attacks the laser, causing the weapon to fire at the island's cliffs, which collapse on the submarine and destroy it along with everyone aboard. Of all the visitors to Latitude Zero, only Lawton (Jaeckel) wishes to return home. He is picked up by a US Navy vessel, where he meets Commander Glenn McKenzie (also Cotten) and Lt. Hastings (also Romero). Startled by these similarities, Lawton additionally discovers that all his knowledge of Latitude Zero's existence was either ruined or taken. Just as he is about to resign himself to the idea that his adventure never occurred, the ship receives a message stating that a cache of diamonds has been deposited in his name in a safe deposit box in New York City, and the ship is ordered to change course to Latitude Zero.

Cotten noted that Toho picked up most, if not all the film's production budget. Latitude Zero's screenplay is credited to Ted Sherdeman and is based on his Latitude Zero stories, which were a popular American radio serial. The Japanese version credits Shinichi Sekizawa as the screenplay adviser, a role described by Stuart Galbraith IV as writing the Japanese version. Release Latitude Zero was released in Japan on July 29, 1969 with a print that was dubbed into Japanese. It received a release in the United States by National General Pictures. Akira Takarada and Akihiko Hirata speak English in the English-language version and are not dubbed. The film received a test screening in Dallas in July of 1969 and received a general theatrical release on December 1970. The film was re-issued theatrically in Japan in 1974 on a double bill with Mothra.

The species was first described by Pieter Cramer in 1775. Description Like many tropical butterflies, this species shows seasonal polyphenism, with the appearance differing between adults according to the season. =Dry-season brood= Male upperside has the ground colour pale bluish white. The forewing has the terminal margin narrowly edged with black that broadens very slightly towards the apex of the wing; the cilia are brownish black. The hindwing is uniformly coloured, except for an anteciliary black line faintly edged on the inner side by a white line within which and touching it is a row of black spots, the anterior spots very faint, the spot in interspace 2 large and well-defined, two geminate (paired) spots in interspace 1 and a very small black lunular dot in interspace 1a; cilia brown, white at the base in the interspaces. In specimens obtained in the height of the dry season the black edging to the termen of the forewing is much reduced and the subterminal series of black spots in the hindwing is altogether missing. The underside is greyish brown. The forewing has seven transverse white bands as follows: two short bands one each side of the discocellulars, the inner one continued downwards to vein 1 and both represented at the costa by two detached spots; two parallel discal bands, the inner one broken at and the outer one terminating on vein 3; two parallel subterminal bands, the outer one slightly lunular; lastly, a more slender terminal band followed by an anteciliary slender black line; the dorsal margin narrowly white; cilia brownish black, their bases white in the interspaces. Hindwing: crossed by nine white bands or lines as follows: three between base of wing and apex of cell, those posteriorly in interspace 1 or on vein 1 abruptly turn upwards and terminate on the dorsum; the first band beyond the cell extends from vein 6 to vein 2, then curves upwards in interspace 1; the next extends straight from just below the costa to vein 4, thus overlapping the previous band for a short distance; the next or postdiscal band runs between the costa and vein 3, the subterminal two also between the costa and vein 3 but the inner one of the two bands is extended down to interspace 1 and there curves upwards towards the dorsum; both the subterminal bands are more or less lunular; in the interspace below vein 2 is a large subterminal black spot speckled with metallic blue scales and bordered inwardly by ochraceous orange; there are also in interspaces la and 1 two black dots inwardly edged by a short white streak set in an ochraceous background; lastly, there is a complete terminal white line followed by a black anteciliary line and a filamentous short black white-tipped tail at apex of vein 2; cilia as on the upperside. Antennae brownish black, the shafts as usual tinged with white; head, thorax and abdomen pale brown, bluish on thorax and base of abdomen; beneath: the palpi, thorax and abdomen white, the third joint of the palpi and the second joint anteriorly black. The female has the upperside ground colour paler than in the male, often quite white; terminal black edging to forewing very much broader, broadest at apex, its margin there diffuse. Hindwing: differs from that of the male as follows: costal margin broadly dusky black; a postdiscal transverse series of dusky-black connected lunules often more or less obsolescent; this is followed by a series of black spots each set in a background of the white ground colour; an anteciliary slender black line as in the male. The underside ground colour is paler than in the male, the markings however are identical. Antenna, head, thorax and abdomen as in the male. =Wet-season brood= Closely resembles the males and females of the dry-season brood; the markings are similar but the ground colour is generally darker both on the upper and undersides, while the black edging to the forewing and the black postdiscal and terminal markings to the hindwing on the upperside are broader and more clearly defined. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in the dry-season brood. Larva Pongam or honge (Pongamia pinnata) is one of the food plants for Jamides celeno \\"When full-fed just half an inch in length, of a dull reddish-green colour, thickly shagreened with minute white tubercles, scarcely, if at all, hairy; the head pale ochraceous, entirely hidden beneath the second segment; the segments increasing in width to about the fifth, the two anal segments slightly decreasing and above flattened, especially the thirteenth; the erectile organs very small; a dorsal pulsating line, somewhat darker than the rest of the body; a subdorsal series of pale green oblique streaks, one on each segment on each side from the third to the eleventh segment inclusive; no other conspicuous markings. Dr. Forel has identified the ant that attends the larva in Calcutta, as Camponotus mitis, Smith. Dr. G. King identifies the plant on which the larva feeds in Calcutta as Heynea trijuga, Roxburgh.\\" (de Nic√©ville quoted by Bingham) Other food plants noted include Atylosia albicans.Kunte, K.

The runners are male, and traditionally run completely naked in public places, with their genitals fully visible, on a designated route. The event was first organized in 1977 at the University of the Philippines Diliman to promote Hubad na Bayani (Tagalog for Naked Hero), a film. It draws its name from the Oblation, a statue of a nude man located in every University of the Philippines campus, which symbolizes \\"a selfless offering of one's self to the country.\\" The event is usually done on December 16, and serves as a protest to contemporary national issues. Participants of the Diliman Oblation Run are male APO members numbering 24 on average. Women participating in the event, however, is not unheard of. Runners usually bear masks to hide their identities, and may wear leaves to cover their genitals. They usually hand roses to a number of female spectators. Additional runs are sometimes held in special events, such as the Centennial Run in 2008 where 100 members ran to celebrate the 100th anniversary of UP. The run has been criticized by Aquilino Pimentel, Jr., a Philippine senator, calling it a \\"blatant display of male genitals\\" and a \\"wanton disregard of the rules of decent society,\\" and comparing it with exhibitionist behaviors that are prohibited by the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines. In line with this, he called for an investigation on March 2009 to determine if the event violates that law. History Alpha Phi Omega is a fraternity founded on December 16, 1925 at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania, United States. The first Philippine APO chapter was chartered on March 2, 1950 at the Far Eastern University in Manila. The Eta chapter was established on February 10, 1953 at UP Diliman. UP Diliman is the main campus of the University of the Philippines, a Philippine state university founded in June 1908. It is particularly known for its student activism. =Inception= Despite inconsistencies, sources generally agree that the Oblation Run started in 1977. Also known as the Ritual Dance of the Brave, it takes its name from the Oblation, a statue of a nude man unveiled in 1939. Originally completely nude, a fig leaf was added to cover its genitals during UP President Jorge Bocobo's term (1934‚Äì1939). It is found in every UP campus, and has since become UP's identifying symbol. The run has since spread to other UP campuses, including Baguio, Los Ba√±os, Manila and Visayas, and non-UP colleges and universities, such as the Polytechnic University of the Philippines, Far Eastern University and Bulacan State University. According to a 1996 article published by the UP Diliman APO website, the run originated when an unnamed APO member ran naked inside the campus to promote an APO-sponsored play called Hubad na Bayani (Tagalog for Naked Hero). The play is dedicated to Rolly Abad, an APO member who was killed in a brawl a few months earlier. The run was a success so APO decided to stage it every year on the fraternity's anniversary, December 16. This view is supported by a GMA News and Public Affairs report. A newer account by Oble, a student newspaper of University of the Philippines Baguio, gives a different story. According to a 2011 article of the paper, the first Oblation Run was done by Rolly Abad himself to protest the Ferdinand Marcos's banning of Hubad na Bayani, a play detailing human rights violations during his martial law regime. Rolly Abad would be killed a few months later in a brawl. In his honor, APO decided to stage the run annually and voice contemporary socio-political issues along with it. Meanwhile, the Philippine Daily Inquirer notes an APO member, Menggie Cobarrubias, saying \\"We [I and four others] started it as a prank when the Marcos dictatorship did not allow the showing of the play, Hubad na Bayani.\\" The play was a political satire against Marcos. An Associated Press article likewise details a different version of the story. According to Oliver Teves who wrote the article, the run started as a stunt to promote Hubad na Bayani, a film that depicted oppressed plantation workers. Similar to the account by Oble, the film was banned by Marcos. Similarly, the Internet Movie Database lists Hubad na Bayani as 1977 film directed by Robert Arevalo. It reportedly won the 1978 Gawad Urian Awards for best picture, best production design and best screenplay. =Participation of women= The two women who ran naked during the 2005 Oblation Run at UP Diliman During the December 2005 Oblation Run at UP Diliman, two unidentified naked women, reportedly Koreans, were seen tailing 30 members who were part of the event. This is the first ever instance that women took part in the occasion. The two, wearing masks to hide their identities, held banners promoting equal rights for women. After posing for photographers, they entered a car which then sped off. The act, however, was condemned by APO. =Centennial Run= To celebrate the University of the Philippines centennial, 100 APO members ran half a mile around the Diliman campus on June 18, 2008. This is the largest Oblation Run in its history in terms of number of participants. The participants started running on 11 AM PST from Vinzons Hall to the Oblation statue in front of Quezon Hall, the UP administration building. Several runners carried placards stating \\"Serve the People\\" and raised social issues, including appeals for greater state subsidy of education and ouster of then-President of the Philippines Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. The event was observed by senior APO alumni, including Jejomar Binay who was the mayor of Makati. Event The Oblation Run is usually held on December 16, in honor of the international founding of Alpha Phi Omega on December 16, 1925. The date may be changed if December 16 falls on a weekend. The run may also be held in concurrence with other significant events, such as APO's national anniversary on March, an APO chapter's anniversary, and occasions significant to their home university. Runners usually bear masks to hide their identities, and may wear leaves to cover their genitals. They usually hand roses to a number of female spectators. Contrary to popular belief, neophytes are forbidden to run.

He also said that it was discriminatory against women. Pimentel's position was supported by officials of the Catholic Church. For instance, Tagbilaran Bishop Leonardo Medroso identified it as \\"malicious\\" and \\"morally lacking.\\" Like Pimintel, he cited that \\"innocent youths\\" are among the spectators of the run. He said that \\"it could be done in a more decent way without showing their nude bodies\\" (trans). Lingayen-Dagupan Archbishop Oscar V. Cruz supports this view. In line with this, he called for an investigation on March 2009 to determine if the event violates the said law. He sought \\"to sanction the parties responsible, including the university authorities, for failure to exercise their bounden duty to see it that the laws and rules of this country prevail.\\" The Oblation Run was defended by Senator Francis Pangilinan, a former UP Student Council president. He argued that the run is not obscene because the runners were merely exercising their freedom of expression. In 2010, Salvador Curutchet of the Institute of the Incarnate Word banned De La Salle Araneta University students from participating in the run. Two years prior to banning it in 2010, the APO chapter of De La Salle held the Oblation Run after obtaining a permit from the city government of Malabon. This was in celebration of its 50th anniversary since the university recognized the fraternity. In response to the ban, the chapter held a luncheon on its 2010 anniversary instead of a nude run. Similarly, there used to be an Oblation Run conducted in Taft Avenue, Manila in support of the APO members taking the bar examinations. However, it has been of prohibited since 2008 by the city government of Manila due to complaints from examinees and their guests regarding \\"the unnecessary noise and obscenity of the said oblation run.\\" References External links *Oblation Run *Alpha Phi Omega Fraternity and Sorority Philippines *UP Alpha Phi Omega Fraternity and Sorority Alpha Phi Omega Clothing- free events Streaking University of the Philippines ","title":"Oblation Run"},{"id":"5701565","text":"Victoria Carolina Coronado y Romero de Tejada (December 12, 1820 ‚Äì January 15, 1911) was a Spanish author considered the equivalent of contemporary Romantic authors like Rosal√≠a de Castro. She married Horatio Perry the American who was Secretary of the U.S. Legation in Madrid. As one of the most well-known poets writing in mid-19th-century Spain, she played a diplomatic role. She both negotiated with the Spanish royal family in private and, through a series of widely published poems, promoted the aims of the Lincoln administration, especially abolition of slavery. At a time when women were not invited to public political conversations, Coronado succeeded in persuasively arguing against Spain's imperial legacy and urging support to rectify her nation's past colonial blunders, especially the introduction of slavery to the Americas.Lisa Surwillo, \\"Poetic Diplomacy: Carolina Coronado and the American Civil War.\\" Comparative American Studies An International Journal 5.4 (2007): 409-422. Youth Victoria Carolina Coronado y Romero de Tejada was born on 12 December 1820 in Almendralejo, Badajoz in the province of Extremadura. She was the daughter of Nicol√°s Coronado y Gallardo and Mar√≠a Antonia Romero de Tejada y Falc√≥n. Her family was well-to-do, but they adhered to a progressive ideology that caused her father and grandfather to be persecuted. After moving to the provincial capital of Badajoz, Carolina received the formal education for girls of her time: fashion and housework. Despite this, she demonstrated at an early age an interest in literature, and she began to read works from widely varying genres. She was self taught in reading and writing and continued her studies despite the criticism of her family. Thanks to this activity she gained a natural ability to compose verses. Her lines were spontaneous and charged with feeling. Many of her poems were based on impossible loves. Her most notable subject was Alberto - who may not even have existed. Her romantic temperament could also have been influenced by the chronic catalepsy from which she suffered. She even appeared to \\"die\\" on several occasions, leading her to interest with the theme of death. She would eventually embalm her deceased husband. Life in Madrid After taking a vow of abstinence after the death of Alberto Tejada at sea (whether he was real or imaginary), she revoked the vow when she married sir Horacio Justo Perry in Madrid in 1852. Perry was the secretary of the Embassy of the United States. Coronado had a revolutionary spirit, and she became famous while living in Madrid for the literary salons she held, a group that was called the Hermandad L√≠rica (Lyrical Sisterhood). Her gatherings served as a meeting-point for progressive writers and a refuge for the persecuted, including many of the most well-known authors of the time. Unfortunately for her, her clandestine refuge and affinity for revolution brought about the disapproval of her contemporaries. Despite this, she succeeded in publishing several works in newspapers and magazines and thus gained a certain measure of fame. Her physical beauty undoubtedly contributed to her success, and it caused infamous admiration in other romantic writers, including poet Jose de Espronceda. Coronado died in Lisbon, Portugal on 15 January 1911. Monument to Coronado in Almendralejo Work The main body of Coronado's work was lyric poetry. Her poems adopted diverse themes, including patriotic sentiment in ¬°Oh, mi Espa√±a!; religion in El amor de los amores and ¬øC√≥mo, Se√±or, no he de tenerte miedo?; and especially Romanticism in poems such as A una gota de roc√≠o, A la rosa blanca, Nada resta de t√≠, ¬°Oh! cu√°l te adoro, A una estrella, and A las nubes. An important theme in her work is her feminism and her strong denunciations of social injustices and violence towards women. Her prolific works were compiled in a single volume entitled Poes√≠as, published in 1843 and re-edited in 1852, that includes a prologue by Juan Eugenio Hartzenbusch. In prose, she wrote a total of fifteen novels including Luz, El bonete de San Ram√≥n, La Siega, Jarrilla, La rueda de la desgracia (1873), and Paquita (1850). Many critics consider the last to be the best. She also authored several plays like El cuadro de la esperanza (1846), Alfonso IV de Le√≥n, Un alcalde de monterilla, and El divino Figueroa, but these endeavors are considered minor in comparison to her non-theatrical works.

The ward system, a precursor to today's City Council districts, was a common political tool of the early 19th century, and is still used in some American cities. When the system was at its peak, the city had six wards, from the first to the sixth.\\"map0435.jpg.\\" Texas State Library and Archives Commission. Retrieved on April 5, 2010. Wards as political divisions =First four wards= In 1840, the Republic of Texas altered the city charter for Houston, dividing it into four wards. Historically the wards reflected geographic boundaries, without consideration of the population density within the wards.Looking back wards .\\" City Savvy Online (City of Houston). (northern hemisphere) Winter 2008. Retrieved on October 20, 2011. Houston's municipal charter of 1840 recognized a square area of 9 square miles, which was divided into four wards. Though the surveyors chose the Harris County Courthouse as the geographical center of Houston, the ward boundaries were formed by two axes converging at the corner of Main and Congress Streets. These resulted in four pie-shaped wards, almost identical in size, numbering clockwise from the northwest quadrant. Voters from each ward elected two alderman, who served the public without pay. Candidates for alderman were limited to white, male, Texas-citizens, and furthermore, were subject to requirements to have nominal tenure of residency and real estate holdings in the city. After slavery ended in Texas in June 1865, ex-slaves were forced to live in separate enclaves within each of Houston's wards. The voting population of the wards was lower than the population, since women and African-Americans had been forbidden from voting. Instead, wards followed boundaries of features such as the Buffalo Bayou, Congress Street, and Main Street. Each ward elected two aldermen to the Houston City Council. The election of the Mayor of Houston was citywide.Kever, Jeannie. \\"Pride lives on in city's six historical wards.\\" Houston Chronicle. September 7, 2004. Retrieved on October 20, 2011. Betty Chapman, a historian, said \\"They really were mixed societies in the early days. Where you worked dictated where you lived, not who you wanted to live around.\\" The ward boundaries touched each other at the intersection of Congress Street and Main Street. The first ward was northwest of that intersection. The ward housed the city's market house and produce industry facilities. The second ward was located to the northeast. The courthouse and the heavy warehouses were located there. Therefore, many lawyers and merchants resided there. The third was situated to the southeast. Businesspeople, craftsmen, and professionals lived there. The Third Ward had fancier houses than other wards. The fourth ward was southwest of the intersection. That ward included what was then the central portion of the city. Freed slaves developed Freedmen's Town in a area in the Fourth Ward. What was once Produce Row, a group of produce businesses on Commerce Street in the urbanized section of First Ward, is now in Downtown Houston. What was then rural First Ward had many farms, so the process of food production occurred in the First Ward. In 2018 the street artist Dual made a mural representing Produce Row on the Main & Co. Building in Downtown. =Fifth Ward= By December 1866, the Fifth Ward had been created, with two aldermen elected from that area during that month. The Fifth Ward was added in 1866 to accommodate the city's growth. Buffalo Bayou served as the ward's southern border, while the White Oak Bayou served as the ward's western border. The idea was not to have an equal number of residents in each but rather to draw lines along natural boundaries: Buffalo Bayou, Main Street, and Congress Street. In 1876 the city created the Sixth ward. It was bounded by the First Ward's southwest boundary and the Buffalo Bayou. =Sixth Ward= In 1876, Houston carved out part of the Fourth Ward to create the Sixth Ward. The new political division was bounded by Buffalo Bayou to the south, Washington Avenue to the north, and Glenwood Cemetery from the west to the city limits. =Abolition= The City of Houston abolished the ward system in the early 1900s.Wood, Roger. Down in Houston: Bayou City Blues. 2003, University of Texas Press. 1st Edition. 72. In 1902, at the beginning of O.T. Hold's term as Mayor of Houston, the city's financial records were in poor shape, and independent auditors found that the city's coffers had a shortage of over $54,000 for the period 1899 to 1902. A 1975 Houston Post article said that the corruption that had been discovered led voters to politically neuter the wards via an election on December 10, 1904. The city of Houston changed to a commission form of government. In November 1915, a newly passed city ordinance officially abolished the wards. On city maps, the wards continued to be used as geographic reference points until 1928. After 1928 other landmarks such as Memorial Park and River Oaks appeared in place of the wards as reference points. Wards as communities While the wards no longer exist legally, area residents still identify certain communities, especially that have been a part of the city since incorporation, as being \\"wards\\" of the city. The ward identification appears on signage and in casual conversation from Houstonians. Houston's wards as they are referred to today are not identical to the wards that existed before 1915.

The margins of these domes have headscarps or 'scallops' separated by ridges that are a consequence of adjoining scallops. Sometimes debris or slumping can be found at the bottom of these scarps or scattered many tens of kilometers away. Many examples show no debris at all. The center of these domes is often, but not always, a depression. There is another theory that the radial ridges of scalloped margin domes are volcanic dikes. During the first month of data from the Magellan spacecraft, the first of these features was found to the northeast of Alpha Regio, on Venus. It was one of the largest of these domes and therefore stood out. The strange feature was originally dubbed by the Magellan Project Science Team The Tick, because the many radiating ridges resembled the legs of a tick. Its concavity was likely confused as domelike as a tick's body, instead of the actuality which is that it is a bowl-shaped depression. Through the first year of Magellan image data The Tick was thought to be a unique feature until an aide to the science team catalogued inconspicuous similar features all over Venus. This resulted in referring to the features as 'ticks' which was later changed to 'scalloped margin domes'.

In 2008, the Yashica name reappeared on cameras produced by the Hong Kong-based MF Jebsen Group. In 2015, trademark rights were transferred to Yashica International Company Limited and appointed 100 Enterprises International Group Co. Limited as Yashica Global Sole Agent. History The company began in December 1949 in Nagano, Japan, when the Yashima Seiki Company was founded with an initial investment of $566.Heiberg, Milton, The Yashica Guide, A Modern Camera Guide Series Book, New York: Amphoto Press, , p. 10 Its eight employees originally manufactured components for electric clocks.Heiberg, p. 10 Later, they began making camera components, and by June 1953 had introduced their first complete camera, the Yashimaflex, a twin-lens reflex (TLR) medium-format camera designed for 6x6 cm medium format film. While the Yashimaflex used lenses labeled Tri-Lausar, successive models used Yashikor and Yashinon lenses. All of these lenses were manufactured for Yashica by the Tomioka Optical Works, beginning a relationship that would last for many years.Condax, Phillip, The Evolution Of The Japanese Camera, Rochester, NY: International Museum of Photography (1984), Late in 1953, Yashima Seiki Company became Yashima Optical Industry Company, Ltd. In 1957, Yashima founded Yashica, Inc., a subsidiary arm in New York City to manage marketing efforts in the United States.Modern Photography (December 1957), p. 133 1957 also marked the introduction of a popular new TLR camera series, the Yashica Mat line., as well as an 8mm cine movie camera. During the next year and a half, Yashima continued to grow, with 1,982 employees by 1958. Later in 1958, Yashima changed its name to Yashica Company, Ltd, when it acquired the Nicca Camera Company, Ltd. The Nicca acquisition was fortuitous, as the designs acquired assisted Yashica in expanding its product line into advanced 35 mm rangefinder cameras. The Yashica Pentamatic, an advanced, modern 35 mm Single Lens Reflex (SLR) camera with a proprietary bayonet-mount, automatic diaphragm (offered only with the Auto Yashinon 50mm/1.8 lens), and interchangeable lenses, was introduced in 1959. As before, Yashica continued to source its lenses from the Tomioka Optical factory. Around 1959‚Äì1960, Yashica acquired the assets of the bankrupt Zunow Optical Industry Co. Ltd.Photographica Pages: Zunow, Pacific Rim CameraPost-Bankruptcy Zunow- Yashinon Labeled Cine Lens, Zunow Cine Equipment, Pacific Rim Camera Though a small company, Zunow had become known for limited production of a very advanced 35 mm SLR camera, along with several high-quality, fast 35 mm camera and 8mm cine (movie) lens designs and a proprietary bayonet-mount lens system similar to that of Yashica Pentamatic. With the assistance of Tomioka Optical Works, Yashica adapted Zunow lens designs into its own 8mm turret cine (movie) cameras.Zunow Cine Equipment: Zunow-Yashinon V, Pacific Rim Camera Top of FRIILike Zunow, Yashica found it difficult to gain market acceptance with its proprietary SLR lens mount, and redesigned its SLR camera line in 1962 to accept the Contax/Praktica M42 lens mount.Reynolds, Clyde, The Contax RTS and Yashica SLR Bayonet and Screw Mount Book, New York: Focal Press (1978), , p. 10 The new SLR camera was introduced as the Penta J. In December 1965, Yashica introduced the world's first commercially successful electronically controlled 35 mm camera, the Electro 35, a popular rangefinder model that in various model subvariants eventually sold 8 million units.Rockwell, Ken, Yashica Electro 35 The company continued to expand its international markets, and in August 1968, Yashica finally acquired its lens manufacturer, the Tomioka Optical and Machine Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (later renamed the Tomioka Optical Co. Ltd.). By this time, Tomioka was one of the largest and most reputable lens manufacturers in Japan. Sales of 35 mm SLRs continued to grow steadily, and Yashica was quickly acquiring a reputation for both electronic camera expertise and high-quality optics. 1968 also marked the year of Yashica's last major TLR camera design, the Yashica Mat-124, a popular model which combined some of the best features of Yashica's earlier TLR cameras. In 1968, Yashica introduced the TL Electro-X 35 mm single lens reflex (SLR) camera and produced it until 1974. It had a screw thread lens mount, the M42 lens mount, for its interchangeable lenses. It also had an all-electronic through-the-lens exposure meter in the viewfinder using lighted arrows (not true LEDs, which were first introduced with the Fujica ST801). The Copal Square SE shutter, a vertically-travelling metal blade focal plane shutter made by Copal Corporation, used in the camera, was electronically controlled.\\"Yashica TL- Electro X\\", thecamerasite.netYashica TL Electro-X manual In 1972, Yashica introduced the TL Electro 35 mm SLR camera which was similar to the Pentax Spotmatic camera made by the Asahi Optical Company (Pentax). The TL Electro also used a lighted exposure meter display similar to that in the TL Electro-X, as well as the M42 screw threaded lens mount for its interchangeable lenses.Nakamura, Karen, \\"Yashica TL Electro\\", photoethnography.com, January 7, 2011 In 1973, Yashica the company began a collaboration with Carl Zeiss it called Top Secret Project 130 to produce a new, professional 35 mm SLR with an electronically controlled shutter bearing the Contax brand, and called the RTS (for \\"Real Time System\\").Contax Cameras UK, \\"The History Of Contax\\", retrieved 22 April 2010 A new prestige line of Yashica/Contax lenses designed by Carl Zeiss were introduced for the camera, with a common C/Y bayonet mount allowing lens interchange between all 35 mm Contax and Yashica SLR camera models.Reynolds, p. 10 The F. Alexander Porsche Group was hired to complete an ergonomic and styling study of the new camera. The new Contax RTS appeared at photokina in 1974, and became a commercial success.Yashica soon introduced several new 35 mm SLR cameras beginning with the FX-1 (1975) and FX-2 (1976). Also in that year, in response to the success of the Contax RTS, Yashica developed the upscale Yashica FR using some of the features of the RTS, including its electromagnetic shutter release. The FR was capable of using the entire range of Carl Zeiss T* lenses. In contemporaneous tests, the FR was described as being tougher in some ways than the more expensive Contax RTS, including better sealing against dust and contaminants.Goldberg, Norman, Frank, Michele, and Rothschild, Norman, Lab Report: Yashica FR, Popular Photography, September 1977, p. 10 This practice of \\"pairing\\" similar Contax models with more affordable, less full-featured, but still high-quality Yashica models would continue for the next ten years. The FR was quickly followed in April 1977 by the FR-I and FR-II. The FR-I was a 35 mm SLR offering even more features of the RTS, including an electronic shutter with both manual and aperture priority modes, and marked the high point for the Yashica brand in competing with Nikon, Canon, and Minolta for the semi-professional SLR camera market.Reynolds, p. 24 A Yashica FX-3 Super with a 500 mm mirror lens. In 1979, Yashica introduced a new inexpensive 35 mm consumer SLR, the FX-3, intended for entry-level buyers.Yashica's FX-3: Basic, Black, And Beautiful, Modern Photography, January 1980, pp. 111‚Äì113 Like all Yashica manual-focus bodies, the affordable FX-3 featured a C/Y lens mount that would also accept Carl Zeiss T* lenses. This simple, lightweight manual- exposure SLR camera sold well, and with minor revisions, stayed in production until 2002. In October 1983, Yashica Company Ltd. was acquired by ceramics giant Kyocera. Initially, the merger resulted in few outward changes. The manual-focus (MF) FX-103 Program, introduced in 1985, continued the \\"pairing\\" tradition of high-end Yashica SLR models with Contax (Contax 159 mm), and was the first Yashica SLR with TTL flash and full programmed exposure capabilities. After 1983, all Yashica brand cameras were marketed by Kyocera (Kyoto Ceramics), which also made newer Contax cameras. By 1985, the company was facing intense market competition from other manufacturers, especially Minolta, which had introduced a competitively priced and advanced autofocus 35 mm SLR camera. Yashica eventually introduced its own autofocus 35 mm SLR camera line that was overpriced and poorly marketed in comparison to its competition. In response, Kyocera gradually repositioned the brand as a budget-priced point-and-shoot camera line, moving production from Japan to Hong Kong, and discontinued high-end SLR camera production. In 2005, Kyocera halted production on all Contax, Yashica, and other Kyocera-branded film and digital cameras. In 2008, Kyocera sold the trademark rights of Yashica to Hong Kong-based MF Jebsen Group, and is under its subsidiary JNC Datum Tech International, Limited.

Like several of the earlier versions it did feature a built in light meter. Settings to the shutter speed and aperture had to be made manually but it did allow the camera to be used without an additional handheld meter.This model also allowed the simple conversion from 120 roll film to 220 roll film. Another advantage to this model was the shutter and film advance were controlled by the film advance handle. Earlier models had a separate mechanism for cocking the shutter. This system was prone to inadvertent double exposures. =35 mm rangefinder= *Electro 35 *Electro 35 CC *Electro 35 MC *Electro 35 CCN *Electro 35 GL *Electro 35 GS *Electro 35 GSN *Electro 35 GT *Electro 35 GTN *Electro 35 GX *Yashica 35 *Yashica 35-f *Yashica minister iii *Yashica 35J *Yashica EE *Yashica Lynx *Yashica MG-1 *Yashica Minimatic C *Yashica Minimatic S *Yashica Minimatic EL *Yashica Minister 700 *Yashica Minister D *Yashica Campus =35 mm SLR cameras= Yashica FR-I SLR with a ML 50 mm 1.7 lens Yashica FX-7 (1979‚Äì1984) *Electro-AX *Electro-X *FFT *FR *FR-I *FR-II *FX-1 *FX-2 *FX-3 *FX-3 Super *FX-3 Super 2000 *FX-7 *FX-7 Super *FX-8 (Only China) *FX-70 *FX-80 (Only China) *FX-103 *FX-800 Super (Only China) *FX-A (less than 1400 pieces Only US & Europe) *FX-D *FX-D SE *Penta J (and successors J-3, J-5, J-7 and J-P) *Pentamatic *Pentamatic II *TL-E *TL Electro *TL-Electro-X *TL Super *107MP/TR-7000/Revue AC-7/DAEWOO 107MP *108MP/Revue AC-8/YODOBASHI CAMERA (Japan Only) *109MP *200AF *210AF (Kyocera Brand Only) *230AF *270AF/230 Super *300AF *Dental Eye I *Dental Eye II *Dental Eye III/Medical Eye (Only Japan) =Compact 35 mm= red eye reduction and self timer Yashica MF-2 super *Yashica AF-J *Yashica AF-J 2 *Yashica auto focus *Yashica auto focus motor *Yashica auto focus motor D *Yashica Auto Focus Motor II *Yashica LAF *Yashica Lynx *Yashica MF-2 *Yashica MF-2 super *Yashica MF-3 *Yashica MF-3 super *Yashica 35-ME *Yashica 35-MF *Yashica MG-2 AutoFlash *Yashica Motor J *Yashica Partner *Yashica Partner AF *Yashica T *Yashica T-Zoom / T4 Zoom / Kyocera T-Zoom *Yashica T2 / Kyocera T *Yashica T3 / Kyocera T Scope *Yashica T3 Super / Kyocera T Scope2 *Yashica T4 / T4 (Safari Edition) *Yashica T4D / Kyocera Slim T / Slim T (Safari Edition) *Yashica T4 Super / T5 *Yashica T4 Super D / T5D / Kyocera T Proof =Compact Digital= *Kyocera DA-1 (1996) *Yashica KC-350(1997) *Yashica KC-600(1997) *Kyocera VP-110 CMOS Camera(1997 *Yashica Samurai 1300DG (1998) *Yashica Samurai 2100DG (1999) *Yashica Y35 digiFilm (2018) =Super 8mm movie camera= * Yashica Super YXL-1,1 * Yashica Super YXL-100 * Yashica Super-40k * Yashica Super-50 * Yashica U-Matic Super 8 * Yashica Nicca Super 30 Electronic * Yashica Super 8 10 Sources  References External links * Yashica Electro 35 & Classic Rangefinder site * Yashica Rangefinder Camera Resource site * Yashica Cameras Price Guide ‚Äì completed auction prices. * Yashica's current website * Yashica TLR Site * Yashica Unveils Three Cameras and Two New Negative Rolls Defunct manufacturing companies of Japan Defunct defense companies of Japan Photography companies of Japan Japanese brands ","title":"Yashica"},{"id":"5701625","text":"Jean-Marie Buchet (born 24 February 1938 in Jemappes, Belgium, near Mons) is a Belgian author and filmmaker. Early life & education At the age of twelve, after failing an examination, Buchet said to a school-fellow \\"Later I will make cinema!\\". At nineteen, he entered the first class of cinema of La Cambre at Institut Sup√©rieur des Arts D√©coratifs (ISAD) an art school created by Henry Van de Velde. From that class, he holds an unforgettable memory (no budget, no equipment). Buchet entered the section of experimental cinema that La Cambre created in 1957. While there, he mainly studied sound editing and made 3 short films: \\"Discours\\" (Speech), \\"Comment se pendre\\" (How to hang himself), \\"that it will wire for sound\\" in 1974, and \\"Masques\\" in 1959, which he made in collaboration with Marc Lobet on a music of Fernand Schirren. Career After having worked at Meuter-Titra laboratories, he worked with the cameraman Willy Kurant. In 1963, he made the short film, \\"La journ√©e de Monsieur Chose\\" The day of Mr Chose [Thing] and the following year, \\"Que peut- on bien faire chez soi le dimanche apr√®s-midi quand on n'a pas la t√©l√©vision?\\" What can we do on a Sunday afternoon, when we don't have a TV?. Five years later, he made \\"Hommage √† Don\\" Helder Camara. In 1974, he directed Suzanne's Fugue, his first full-length film, which had a limited budget of 200.000 FB or US $5,000. Five years later, with Mireille and the others, he worked on a full-length film turned during six weeks, in studio, produced by Godfroid Courtmans. This was a film of humor, on the razor's edge, neighbors absurdity, in the vein of Czech films of the 1960s. Selected in San Remo and Moscow, the film attains limited public success. After the film \\"Poveri ma belli\\" from Dino Risi, Buchet launched Pauvres mais Beaux, a production house, and returnedm to the short film and documentary, Les meilleurs in 1982 and Dupont Durand in 1989. During his later years, he wrote and directed some shorts. He now works on \\"Passions froides\\" a full-length film which he does not despair to carry out, in spite of resistance from his producer. During his career, he directed various short fictions, experimental films and documentaries. He is also the author of two full-length films, \\"La fugue de Suzanne\\" (Suzanne's Fugue, 1974) and Mireille dans la vie des autres (Mireille and the Others, 1979). Mireille and the Others was entered into the 11th Moscow International Film Festival. In 1968, he collaborated with Robbe De Hert in the realization of committed films and took part in the creation of \\"Cin√©libre\\". In addition to work as screenwriter, script-doctor, manager and director of production, Jean-Marie Buchet also directed, until 2002, a workshop of writing of scenario at the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles (ULB-ELICIT). He has been writing movie criticism in the \\"Grand Angle\\" review since 1996 and works in the service of film restoration at the royal Film Archive of Belgium since 1999.

It is named for its similarity to the purple emperor butterfly.  Description  The wingspan is in the female and in the male. The upper side of the wings is dark brown, with metallic blue-violet hues in the male, and it has a clear postdiscal band on the hind wing and several light spots on the fore wing. These clear areas can be presented in two different aspects; they are white on the butterflies of the nominal form ilia, and clear fawn in the form clytie. For both forms, the fore wing also has an orange-coloured ocellus, which makes differentiating the species from Apatura iris possible. A similar ocellus is present on the hind wing in both species. The reverse side of the fore wing is brown and the back of the hind wing is dull brown with, as in A. iris, an orange ocellus centered in black.

It feeds on tree honeydew and flies near their summit. It goes down only to find moisture, honeydew shrubs or excrement. The eggs are laid singly on leaves. The caterpillar host plants are willows and poplars, in particular Populus tremula and Populus nigra. A. ilia either pupates in the same year or winters as a young caterpillar, becoming brown, stuck to a twig. The greyish green chrysalis hangs from a leaf or twig. Biotope Flourishes only in damp deciduous woods with good naturalness, forests or edges of interior clearings and river valleys at altitudes between sea level and about 600m. Ecology and distribution It is present in most of Europe and across the Palearctic to Japan. However, it is absent from the European Mediterranean islands and the southernmost regions, from the majority of Spain and Portugal, southern Italy and Greece, as well as Nordic countries (Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Poland, northern Germany and the British Isles). This species belongs to a group of 35 European butterflies for which ecologists had sufficient data to assess the possible movements of their range in Europe. Of these 35 butterflies studied, Apatura ilia was an exception - it is the only species that has seen the northern limits of its area move slightly down to the south while its southern limit remained stable. Cultural references *It is named in the Classical tradition, Ilia was the mother of Romulus and Remus in Roman mythology. *In March 1987 DPR Korea issued a postage stamp depicting Apatura ilia.

In the 2013/2014 season, while playing in Division 2 (East), FC Roskilde set a new Danish league record for the number of consecutive league wins, with 20 wins in a row.

Biography Mart√≠n-Santos was born in Larache, Morocco in 1924; son of the military doctor Leandro Mart√≠n-Santos. At five years of age his family moved to San Sebasti√°n, where he would ultimately spend most of his life. He studied medicine in Salamanca and received his doctorate in psychiatry in Madrid, where he developed friendships with specialists such as , Pedro La√≠n Entralgo, and . At the same time, he became interested in literature and became an habitu√© of the Caf√© Gij√≥n, where he met many prominent writers of his generation, including Ignacio Aldecoa, Rafael S√°nchez Ferlosio, and Juan Benet. He also spent some time with Alfonso Sastre. In 1951 he became director of the regional psychiatric hospital in San Sebastian and would remain there the rest of his life. He also participated in the so-called \\"Academia Errante,\\" a debate forum created by restless Spanish intellectuals in the sixties who were searching for new forms of expression. He read Jean-Paul Sartre extensively and became interested in existentialism. He married Roc√≠o Laff√≥n Bayo in 1953, with whom he had three children. In 1955, he wrote a thesis entitled Dilthey, Jaspers y la comprensi√≥n del enfermo mental (Dilthey, Jaspers, and Understanding the Mentally Ill), followed in 1964 by Libertad, temporalidad y transferencia en el psicoan√°lisis existencial (Freedom, Temporality, and Transference in Existential Psychoanalysis). He became a member of the Partido Socialista Obrero Espa√±ol (PSOE), a clandestine organization, and was thrown into prison on three occasions. Later, he joined the Executive Committee and became friends with the socialist leader Enrique M√∫gica Herzog. Near the end of 1960 he finished writing the novel Tiempo de silencio, which was published in 1962 with twenty censored pages. An uncensored edition was not published until 1981. In this novel he makes innovative use of interior monologue, second-person narrative, indirect free style, stream of consciousness, and mythification; narrative devices that had been pioneered earlier by James Joyce. His wife Roc√≠o died, possibly a suicide, in 1963. That same year, he began writing Tiempo de destrucci√≥n (Time of Destruction), but it was left incomplete when he died in a traffic accident in Vitoria, Spain on 21 January 1964. It was published, as he left it, in 1975. The same publisher had also released a posthumous collection of his short stories, entitled Ap√≥logos, in 1970.

As of December 31, 2018, it has 513 properties with 40,541 rooms.  History  The chain began as an idea by the former CEO of Marcus Corporation, Steven Marcus to create a limited-service, discount-priced motel chain. The first property, located in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, opened in 1973 and was named Budgetel (the property later became a La Quinta Inn). A prototype hotel was designed in 1984 in the form of a long, linear three or four story boxlike building covered by precast concrete slabs. This design gave the Budgetel hotels a distinctive appearance. Today, however, Baymont properties can have a variety of appearances, and some have been converted from other brands. Each hotel features oversized rooms and interior corridors.Motel in America p. 207-208 Today, Baymont Inn & Suites competes in the lower mid-priced category, along with AmericInn Hotels, La Quinta Inn, and Fairfield Inn by Marriott. This means it has a \\"deluxe continental breakfast\\", a swimming pool, and \\"comfortable accommodations\\", but no on-site dining or expansive convention facilities. The name was changed to Baymont Inn in early 1999. In July 2004, Marcus Corporation sold the Baymont chain to the La Quinta Corporation, the Dallas parent of La Quinta Inns and La Quinta Inns & Suites. In November 2005, La Quinta was sold to affiliates of the Blackstone Group for approximately $3.4B. Following that acquisition, Blackstone converted certain Baymont Inns to La Quinta and in March 2006, Blackstone sold the Baymont brand name to what was then the Cendant Hotel Group (since renamed Wyndham Hotels & Resorts). America's Best Franchising revived the Budgetel name in 2008 for a new chain. As of January 2016 there are over 400 Baymont Inns and Suites open in the United States. Former Baymont Inns retained by Blackstone Group have since transitioned to that company's La Quinta Inn brand. Most locations are in the South and the Midwest, with a handful of locations in California. Under the ownership of Wyndham Hotel Group, in 2008 Baymont Inn & Suites launched its new positioning and creative campaign focusing on its claimed \\"warm, inviting, and neighborly service\\". The new positioning differentiates the brand from fellow competitors within the midscale (without food & beverage) segment by promoting Baymont's \\"hometown hospitality\\".

He pioneered modern Belgian film with Henri Storck. He was inspired by French avant-garde cinema, particularly the works of Germaine Dulac. Biography Dekeukeleire was born in Ixelles and died in Werchter. For his first film, Combat de Boxe, produced in 1927, Dekeukeleire staged a boxing match in his room based on a poem by Paul Werrie. Dekeukeleire recruited two professional boxers, one of which was the Belgian lightweight boxing champion. The abrupt changes of scale, the use of overprinting, and the use of very short shots alternating between the spectators and the fighters made this film unusually complex for the Twenties. He returned to this idea the following year with his masterpiece, Impatience, which is close to futurism. When it premiered, Charles Dekeukeleire stated that the gaze of the spectators must adapt, to let itself slip along with the film to feel the fragments of various lengths. The desire for physical contact with the machine is at the base of this film. In this drama with four characters (the Mountain, the abstract Motorbike, the Woman and the Blocks), the mechanical body, that of the Motorbike is strongly associated with the female body, first clothed and then naked with leather. Dekeukeleire exchanges parts between the two characters, resulting in a suggestive motorbike-woman/woman-motorbike. These two characters, the Motorbike and the Woman, then enter into interaction with the abstracted Mountain and Blocks, as if the director intended analogies between humanity, the animal world, the vegetable world and the mechanical world. In 1929, he filmed Histoire de d√©tective, a surrealist inspiration. These first three avant-garde silent films made his name in cinematography. His work then oscillated between documentaries and commissioned works. His work deals with race at times, for example in Terres br√ªl√©es (Burned Grounds, 1934), which chronicles an automobile journey through the Belgian Congo. Dekeukeleire made one hundred films in a career spanning four decades. Writing career Dekeukeleire published articles in reviews such as 7 Arts, Nouvelle Team, and The Latest News. He is also the author of two books: The Social Emotion and The Film and Thought, Extra Light, Brussels, 1947.

Life and work The self-taught artist Steffan Danielsen found most of the inspiration for his pictures in his home village N√≥lsoy and the island of same name. In his art Danielsen distils the essence of the landscape in an original way. B√°r√∞ur J√°kupsson in his book F√¶r√∏ernes billedkunst (F√§r√∂i screen end art) compares Danielsen with the classical author S√°mal Mikines, who lived on a similarly small, remote and inaccessible Faroe Island: Mykines. Both islands have important bird colonies and both islands have only one village. Danielsen spent most of his 24 productive years on N√≥lsoy, with just one period abroad in Denmark between 1951 and 1956. His first exhibition in 1952 in √ìlavs√∏ka brought him to the attention of the Faroese art community. Danielsen's paintings describe his homeland island in everyday detail, capturing not only the landscapes, boats, buildings but also the atmosphere and spirit of the place. He captures the light, with sun and rain, snow and fog, and the predominantly red tones allude sensitively to the colour nuances of the Faroese landscape.

Developer J. W. Link and his Houston Land Corporation envisioned a \\"great residential addition\\" according to the neighborhood's original sales brochure. Link's planning details for the area included four wide boulevards with the best curbing and extensive landscaping. Link built his own home in Montrose, known as the Link-Lee Mansion, which is now part of the University of St. Thomas campus. A streetcar, the Montrose Line, ran through the neighborhood.

The Bohemian flavor of the Montrose would spawn both the Westheimer Colony Art Festival in 1971 and the subsequent street fair in 1973, which would become known as the Westheimer Street Festival. Also starting around the 1970s the area became known as the center for the gay and lesbian community of Houston. The area sported an estimated 30-40 gay bars at the time, including the Bayou Landing, thought to be the largest gay dance hall between the coasts, and several gay activist groups, including the Gay Liberation Front. During the HIV/AIDS epidemic of the 1980s, the Montrose clinic was opened by Rev. Ralph Lasher and it later, at a different location in Montrose, became a community health center.

Signs and symptoms Knowing the symptoms that can be experienced with a sprain is important in determining that the injury is not really a break in the bone. When a sprain occurs, broken blood vessels will hemorrhage into the tissue that surrounds the joint, causing a visible bruise. White blood cells responsible for inflammation migrate to the area, and blood flow increases as well.Ankle Sprains Symptoms -eMedicineHealth.com, Retrieved on 22 January 2010. Along with this inflammation, swelling and pain is experienced. The nerves in the area become more sensitive when the injury is suffered, so pain is felt as throbbing and will worsen if there is pressure placed on the area. Warmth and redness are also seen as blood flow is increased. Also there is a decreased ability to move the joint.

Cause  Movements ‚Äì especially turning, and rolling of the foot ‚Äì are the primary cause of an ankle sprain.Sprained Ankle ‚Äì American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, Retrieved on 22 January 2010. The risk of a sprain is greatest during activities that involve explosive side-to-side motion, such as tennis, skateboarding or basketball. Sprained ankles can also occur during normal daily activities such as stepping off a curb or slipping on ice. Returning to activity before the ligaments have fully healed may cause them to heal in a stretched position, resulting in less stability at the ankle joint. This can lead to a condition known as Chronic Ankle Instability (CAI), and an increased risk of ankle sprains. The following factors can contribute to an increased risk of ankle sprains: * Weak muscles/tendons that cross the ankle joint, especially the muscles of the lower leg that cross the outside, or lateral aspect of the ankle joint (i.e. peroneal or fibular muscles); * Weak or lax ligaments that join together the bones of the ankle joint ‚Äì this can be hereditary or due to overstretching of ligaments as a result of repetitive ankle sprains; * Inadequate joint proprioception (i.e., sense of joint position); * Slow neuron muscular response to an off-balance position; * Running on uneven surfaces; * Shoes with inadequate heel support; and * Wearing high-heeled shoes ‚Äì due to the weak position of the ankle joint with an elevated heel, and a small base of support. Ankle sprains occur usually through excessive stress on the ligaments of the ankle. This can be caused by excessive external rotation, inversion or eversion of the foot caused by an external force. When the foot is moved past its range of motion, the excess stress puts a strain on the ligaments. If the strain is great enough to the ligaments past the yield point, then the ligament becomes damaged, or sprained. Diagnosis  The diagnosis of a sprain relies on the medical history, including symptoms, as well as making a differential diagnosis, mainly in distinguishing it from strains or bone fractures. The Ottawa ankle rule is a simple, widely used rule to help differentiate fractures of the ankle or mid-foot from other ankle injuries that do not require x-ray radiography. It has a sensitivity of nearly 100%, meaning that a patient who tests negative, according to the rule almost certainly does not have an ankle fracture. If ankle pain is persistent 6-8 weeks after initial sprain, MRI imaging of the joint can be considered to rule out peroneal tendon, osteochondral, or syndesmotic injury. = Classification of severity = Ankle sprains are classified grade 1, 2, and 3. Depending on the amount of damage or the number of ligaments that are damaged, each sprain is classified from mild to severe. A grade 1 sprain is defined as mild damage to a ligament or ligaments without instability of the affected joint. A grade 2 sprain is considered a partial tear to the ligament, in which it is stretched to the point that it becomes loose. A grade 3 sprain is a complete tear of a ligament, causing instability in the affected joint. Bruising may occur around the ankle. = Types =  Inversion (lateral) ankle sprain  The most common type of ankle sprain occurs when the foot has a force, typically body weight, causing it to internally rotated to a higher degree than it is supposed to, affecting the lateral side of the foot. When this type of ankle sprain happens, the outer, or lateral, ligaments are stretched too much. The anterior talofibular ligament is one of the most commonly involved ligaments in this type of sprain, followed by the calcaneofibular ligament and posterior talofibular ligament respectively, the later found in more severe ankle sprains. Approximately 70‚Äì85% of ankle sprains are inversion injuries. Ankle Inversion When the ankle becomes inverted, the anterior talofibular and calcaneofibular ligaments are damaged. This is the most common ankle sprain.  Eversion (medial) ankle sprain  A less common type of ankle sprain is called an eversion injury, affecting the medial side of the foot. This happens when, instead of the ankle rotating medially resulting in an inversion injury(the foot rolling too much to the inside), the ankle rotates laterally resulting in an eversion injury (when the foot rolls too much to the outside). When this occurs, the medial, or deltoid, ligament is strained.  High (syndesmotic) ankle sprain  A high ankle sprain is an injury to the large ligaments above the ankle that join together the two long bones of the lower leg, called the tibia and fibula. High ankle sprains commonly occur from a sudden and forceful outward twisting of the foot. This commonly occurs in contact and cutting sports such as football, rugby, ice hockey, roller derby, basketball, volleyball, lacrosse, softball, baseball, track, ultimate frisbee, soccer, tennis and badminton and horse riding.  Treatment  Initial treatment commonly consists of rest, icing, compression and elevation (which is often referred to by the mnemonic RICE or sometimes PRICE with P being \\"protection\\"). These elements have been recommended by physicians for decades for the treatment of soft tissue damage, and sprained ankles, one of the most common soft tissue injuries. RICE helps limit the amount of swelling to the area, and \\"facilitates venous and lymphatic drainage\\". While nearly universally accepted as a treatment, there is insufficient evidence to determine its relative effectiveness as therapy for acute ankle sprains in adults, and the National Athletic Trainers Association notes that most of the rationale for using RICE or individual components is based largely on low- quality clinical trials and laboratory studies with uninjured participants or animal models = Conservative measures = A brace offering moderate support and compression for a Grade I ankle sprain. Ice is often used to reduce swelling in cycles of 15‚Äì20 minutes on and 20‚Äì30 minutes off. Icing an ankle too long can cause cold injuries, which is indicated by the area turning white.Lifestyle and home remedies, MayoClinic.com. Retrieved 3 May 2010. Also, it is often recommended that ice not be applied directly to the skin, but should have a thin buffer between the ice and the affected area, and some professionals think ice need not be applied at all. Recently, Gabe Mirkin, MD, who coined and popularized the acronym RICE in his The Sports Medicine Book in 1978, now has some issues with the \\"i\\" in RICE. After reviewing modern studies, he notes that because ice closes off the blood vessels, \\"ice doesn‚Äôt increase healing‚Äîit delays it.\\" and now advises skipping ice altogether unless needed to reduce pain from swelling. Still, it is widely accepted and, although the clinical evidence is sparse, cryotherapy (ice) has been a mainstay of clinical practice for rehabilitation specialists. In uncomplicated lateral ankle sprains, swelling of the soft tissue can be prevented with compression around both malleoli, elevation of the injured ankle higher than the heart, and pain-free exercises. An orthopedic walking boot is often used for the treatment of a sprained ankle injury. Braces and crutches are also used to help alleviate the pain so the injured ankle can heal as quickly and painlessly as possible. Although found to be less effective than casts, compression bandages are used to provide support and compression for sprained ankles. Wrapping is started at the ball of the foot and slowly continued up to the base of the calf muscle; this allows the swelling to travel up toward the center of the body so that it does not gather in the foot. = Rehabilitation and recovery = Many different types of rehabilitation exercises can be done to aid an ankle sprain regardless of the severity of the injury. The purpose of rehabilitation gives the ability for the ankle to regain strength and flexibility. A sprained ankle becomes swollen due to the increased amount of edema within the tissue, since this physiological effect is the foundation of the pain the decline of edema is the main goal during the beginning of rehabilitation. This can be done instantly by implementing the RICE mechanism which is resting the ankle, applying ice, compressing, and elevating it. The emphasis of the first week of rehabilitation should be on protecting the ankle to avoid further damage. As the healing progresses, stress can be applied by different mechanisms until the ankle is fully recovered. The key to a fast recovery is to implement all the different types of ankle sprain exercises so that the range of motion will increase while the pain is decreasing. In cases where the ankle does not heal in an appropriate amount of time, other exercises need to be implemented so that strength and flexibility can be regained. Physical therapists assign different types of ankle sprain exercises that deal with ankle flexibility, strengthening, balance, and agility. If an ankle sprain does not heal properly, the joint may become unstable and may lead to chronic pain.Sprained Ankle Overview ‚Äì Webmd.com, Retrieved on 22 January 2010. Receiving proper treatment and performing exercises that promote ankle function is important to strengthen the ankle and prevent further injury.  Ankle immobilization  A short period of immobilization in a below-knee cast or in an Aircast leads to a faster recovery at 3 months compared to a tubular compression bandage. In contrast, a randomized controlled trial has concluded that appropriate exercise immediately after a sprain improves function and recovery. These exercises were focused on increasing ankle range of movement, activation and strengthening of ankle musculature, and restoring normal sensorimotor control, and were carried out for 20 minutes, three times a day. After the injury, it is advisable not to walk for a couple of days. Bed rest will help to accelerate the healing process and eliminate the chance of mishandling the affected limb. Driving vehicles or operating machinery should not be attempted. The amount of therapy that a person can handle will depend on their level of pain and the grade of sprain they experienced. It is not recommended to return to sports or extreme physical activities until hopping on the ankle is possible without pain. Wearing high-top tennis shoes may also help prevent ankle sprains if the shoes used are laced snugly and if the ankle is taped with a wide, nonelastic adhesive tape.Ankle Sprains: Healing and Preventing Injury ‚Äì Family doctor.org, Retrieved on 22 January 2010.  Ankle mobilization/manipulation  For acute ankle sprains, manual joint mobilization/manipulation of the ankle has been found to diminish pain and increase range of motion. For treatment of subacute/chronic lateral ankle sprains, these techniques improved ankle range-of-motion, decreased pain and improved function.  Ankle exercises  To prevent sprains or re-injury from occurring, strengthening and stretching exercises should be done through a full range of ankle motion. To improve ankle mobility, ankle circles can be performed by extending the legs in front of the body and then moving the foot up and down, side to side, or rotating the foot in a circle. Another common exercise to improve mobility as well as proprioception is to use the toes to draw the letters of the alphabet in the air. Most importantly, the lateral aspect of the ankle joint should be strengthened with eversion exercises (i.e., underside of the foot is turned outward against resistance) to improve lateral ankle stability. Stretching is also an important component of a strengthening program, to help maintain joint flexibility. Balance and stability training are especially important to retrain the ankle muscles to work together to support the joint.Sprained Ankle: Treatment and Drugs ‚Äì Mayo clinic.com, Retrieved on 22 January 2010. This includes exercises that are performed by standing on one foot and using the injured ankle to lift the body onto its toes. To further enhance balance and stability, exercise devices such as the wobble board can be used, progressing from double-leg to single-leg stance, first with eyes open and then with eyes closed, for enhanced effectiveness.  Flexibility exercises  An example of a flexibility exercise is a towel stretch http://www.livestrong.com/article/470163-ankle- towel-stretch// towel stretch and writing the alphabet with toes which will increase the range of motion.  Strengthening exercises  Ankle strengthening exercises are step ups and walking on toes which will strengthen the muscles around the swollen area.  Balance exercises  Balance exercises include the use of a balance board, which helps the whole body function to maintain balance. The use of balance boards has been shown to produce significantly positive results in gaining proper balance.  Agility exercises  Rehabilitation Exercises for an ankle sprain Plyometrics exercises such as squat jumps and power skipping should not be implemented until the ankle has regained full agility. Other strategies that can be used to prevent ankle injury include: * Ensure proper warm-up prior to stretching and activity; * When running, choose level surfaces and avoid rocks or holes; * Ensure that shoes have adequate heel support; * If high-heeled shoes are worn, ensure that heels are no more than 2 inches in height, and avoid heels with a narrow base.  Prognosis  Most people improve significantly in the first two weeks. However, some still have problems with pain and instability after one year (5‚Äì30%). Re-injury is also very common.  Epidemiology  Adolescents vs general population ankle sprain instances Ankle Sprain Epidemiology- U.S. Military vs General Population Ankle sprains can occur through either sports or activities of daily living, and individuals can be at higher or lower risk depending on a variety of circumstances including their homeland, race, age, sex, or profession. In addition, there are different types of ankle sprains such as eversion ankle sprains and inversion ankle sprains. Overall, the most common type of ankle sprain to occur is an inversion ankle sprain, where excessive plantar flexion and supination cause the anterior talofibular ligament to be affected. A study showed that for a population of Scandinavians, inversion ankle sprains accounted for 85% of all ankle sprains. Most ankle sprains occur in more active people, such as athletes and regular exercisers. = Previous ankle sprains = When an ankle sprain occurs, subsequent ankle sprains are much more likely to follow. The rate of recurrence is particularly high for athletes in high-risk sports. The most widely recommended preventative measures for recurring sprains are wearing ankle-protective gear (tape, or ankle brace) and implementing exercises designed to strengthen the ankle and improve one's balance (e.g., balance ball exercises). In a review article of ankle sprain prevention research, the authors reference a season-long study on a group of soccer players. 60 players wore ankle-protective (tape or ankle-braces) throughout the soccer season, and another 171 players were enrolled in the control group, as they wore no ankle protective gear. At the end of the season, 17% of the players who did not wear ankle braces/tape sprained their ankles, while only 3% of the players who wore protection incurred the same injury. Amongst the players who sprained their ankles and did not wear ankle-protective gear, 25% had a history of previous ankle sprains. Another peer-reviewed article references a study which concluded that ankle exercising could decrease the risk of recurring sprains by 11%. = Age = In a study comparing the prevalence of ankle sprains between age, race, and sex, individuals who were aged 10‚Äì19 years old had highest instances of ankle sprains. It can be suggested that adolescents are more physically active, which leads to higher chances of ankle sprains. Since sports deal with high utilization of the ankle, over 50% of ankle sprains are due to sport-related injuries. Ankle sprain incident rates of average males to females = U.S. military = Moreover, average ankle sprains for the general U.S. population are estimated at 5‚Äì7 ankle sprains for every 1000 person-years; however, a study showed that for military cadets, instances for ankle sprains were about 10 times those of the general population = Male vs. female = Another study comparing sex influences on ankle sprains found that male and female counterparts had similar incidence rates of ankle sprains. However, at a specific age range of 19‚Äì25 years old, males were found to have a substantially greater rate of ankle sprains than females. Furthermore, at ages 30 and over, females showed a higher incidence of ankle sprains than males. From this, it can be said that age and activity levels are better indicators of ankle sprain risks than gender.

It describes war- torn men suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, otherwise known as shell shock. Owen based the poem on his experience of Craiglockhart Military Hospital, near Edinburgh, where he was invalided in the summer of 1917 with neurasthenia, and became the patient of Dr A.J. Brock. Using imagery of death and violence, Owen presents a chilling portrait of men haunted by their experiences.  Short Analysis  The poem adopts a questioning tone initially, with the speaker asking ‚ÄúWho are these? Why sit they here in twilight?‚Äù Owen uses this to present the men almost as strange carnival exhibits to be inspected or wondered at, emphasised by the base pronoun \\"these\\". They are depicted as grizzly, fascinating creatures, which seem \\"hellish\\" to the speaker. The second stanza goes on to depict memory as a cruel monster which tortures their minds, forcing them to relive the \\"Carnage incomparable\\" they witnessed. Owen's chilling contrast between \\"Treading blood\\" and \\"lungs that had loved laughter\\" echoes a regular theme in his works, that the men who gave themselves for the war had once been amiable and friendly people before the dead \\"ravished\\" their minds. The third stanza describes how those who survived the war live now with shell shock, in that scenes from the battlefield insert themselves into everyday life; sunlight is a \\"blood-smear\\" on a window, then night falls \\"blood-black\\" - they cannot escape the sight of blood. The macabre tone of the poem is added to by the image of hallucinations of \\"set-smiling corpses\\", describing the \\"hilarious, hideous\\" faces of the patients as they remember. Typically for Owen, he concludes with blame; it was \\"us who smote them\\", and \\"dealt them war and madness\\"; this echoes the ending of Owen's most famous poem, Dulce et Decorum Est.

MPHO includes blood, cells, tissues, human milk, and organ products. History The International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT) working group on automation and data processing began in the early 1990s and was later joined by the AABB, the American Red Cross (ARC), the Department of Defense, and the Health Industry Manufacturers Association in the development of the symbology which would come to be known as the ISBT 128 international standard. The acronym ISBT was originally derived from the important role played by the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT) in the development of the standard. Today it expands as International Standard for Blood and Transplant. The number 128 reflects the 128 characters of the ASCII 7 bit character set that the standard uses. The International Council for Commonality in Blood Banking Automation (ICCBBA) was established in 1995 and given the responsibility for implementation and management of the new standard. Version 1.0 of the ISBT 128 Standard Technical Specification was first published in 1997, and was intended to replace the ABC Codabar and other similar CODABAR-based standards in use in transfusion medicine at that time with a more secure bar code symbology which contains more information. The current version of the ISBT 128 Standard Technical Specification is version 5.8.0. An article from the World Health Organization states: > \\"ISBT 128, managed by ICCBBA, is the sole global standard for the > identification and coding of MPHO.

A large version of a naval ensign that is flown on a warship's mast just before going into battle is called a battle ensign. An ensign differs from a jack, which is flown from a jackstaff at the bow of a vessel. Most countries have only one national flag and ensign for all purposes. In other countries, a distinction is made between the land flag and the civil, state and naval ensigns. The British ensigns, for example, differ from the flag used on land (the Union Flag) and have different versions of plain and defaced Red and Blue ensigns for civilian and state use, as well as the naval ensign (White Ensign).

Timothy Sheldon (D-WA 35th District) Since 2004 he has also represented Mason County as a Mason County Commissioner for District 2. Sheldon was born in Mason County, and has lived there most of his life. He attended public schools until he entered the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania in 1965, graduating in 1969 with a BS in Economics. He earned his MBA at the University of Washington. Following a decade of work in economic development for Native American tribes, Sheldon began a new career as executive director of the non- profit Mason County Economic Development Council, a post he held for 18 years. First elected to the Washington State House of Representatives for a term beginning in 1991, Sheldon served three terms there before being elected to the State Senate in 1997. Currently in his fifth four-year Senate term, Sheldon is vice chair of the Energy Environment & Telecommunications Committee, and sits on the Rules and Transportation committees.http://www.leg.wa.gov/senate/senators/Pages/sheldon.aspx Party ties Sheldon made himself unpopular with the Democratic Caucus by taking a strong stance against funding the Mariners and Seahawks sports stadiums with State owned money, calling the proposed legislation \\"corporate welfare.\\" He also voted against budgets that he felt did more harm than good to his mostly rural constituents, even when his party supported them. He has alternately been described as a conservative and termed a \\"Republican in sheep's clothing\\" or a \\"maverick\\" due to his erratic voting history. He voted for Republican George W. Bush in 2004 and then Democrat Barack Obama in 2008. He was one of three Democratic state senators to vote against the gay-marriage bill. After the 2012 state legislature elections, he and Senator Rodney Tom joined the Republicans in a \\"Majority Coalition Caucus,\\" resulting in a power sharing agreement, effectively giving the two Democrats control of the state senate along with 23 Republicans. The Caucus chaired the most powerful committees (such as ways and means, commerce and labor, and K-12 education, among others) for the 2013-14 session, and a few committees, such a Transportation, he claims a \\"bi-partisan\\" co-chair with the Democratic Caucus. Sheldon subsequently became president pro tempore of the Senate, elected by both Democrats and Republicans. He lost this position in 2015 when Democrats withdrew support in favor of Republican Pam Roach.

The show stars Jamie Kennedy, an actor who follows his dream of becoming a successful rapper. The show was written by Kennedy after the success of the movie Malibu's Most Wanted, which he starred in. Along for the ride is his close friend Stu Stone, who keeps Jamie in check to stick to their rap career. Throughout the show there are various celebrity appearances. From the beginning, Jamie expresses his dislike for fellow actor Jason Biggs (notable is the fact Biggs and Kennedy both appeared in Kevin Smith's 2001 film Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back). Jamie and Stu also encounter many different rappers during the season, including Mike Jones, Ice-T, and a performance with the Three 6 Mafia. Jamie and Stu also try to recruit special guests on their album, getting Bob Saget formerly of the TV show Full House. The song was titled \\"Rollin' with Saget.\\" Robin Sloan Bechtel, an executive at Warner Bros. Records discovered Jamie Kennedy and Stu Stone's music on MySpace before the MTV show was greenlit.

Publication history He first appeared in Firestorm the Nuclear Man #1 (March 1978) were created by Gerry Conway and Al Milgrom. Fictional character biography Nobel Prize-winning physicist Martin Stein was caught in an accident that allowed them to fuse into Firestorm the \\"Nuclear Man\\" with student Ronnie Raymond. Due to Stein's being unconscious during the accident, Raymond was prominently in command of the Firestorm form with Stein a voice of reason inside his mind, able to offer Raymond advice on how to use their powers without actually having any control over their dual form. Banter between the two was a hallmark of their adventures. Stein was initially completely unaware of their dual identity, leaving him concerned about his unusual disappearances and blackouts, but Ronnie was eventually able to convince him of the truth, allowing them to bond as separate individuals rather than as parts of a whole. After the accident, Firestorm took to defending New York City from such threats as Multiplex and Killer Frost. The 1982 series began with the teenaged Raymond adjusting to his newfound role and later delved into the issue of the nuclear arms race. The Fury of Firestorm slowly developed the lives of Raymond and Stein, as the teenager struggled with high school and moved towards graduation and the scientist found a life outside the lab after learning about his bond with Raymond. A second nuclear hero, Firehawk, was added as a love interest for Firestorm in 1984. In the same year, the character of Felicity Smoak was introduced, initially having a combative relationship with Raymond, but eventually becoming his step-mother following her marriage to his father Eddie.\\"Felicity Smoak\\" \\"Comicvine\\", Retrieved January 17, 2017. The series also tried to create a sense of fun, something that Gerry Conway felt was missing during his years writing Spider- Man;Conway, Gerry. \\"Nuclear Reactions: Just Your Average Hot-Headed Hero,\\" The Fury of Firestorm #1 #1 (June 1982). DC Comics. the banter between Ronnie Raymond and Martin Stein contributed to this. Upon graduation from high school, Raymond entered college in Pittsburgh, where Stein had been hired as a professor. Afterward, together they searched for a cure for their bond. When Conway left the series in 1986, John Ostrander (with artist Joe Brozowski) began writing the Firestorm stories. His first major story arc pitted Firestorm against the world, as the hero, acting on a suggestion from a terminally ill Professor Stein, demanded that the United States and the Soviet Union destroy all of their nuclear weapons.Firestorm Vol. 2 #64. DC Comics. After confrontations with the Justice League and most of his enemies, Firestorm faced the Russian nuclear superhero Pozhar in the Nevada desert, where an atomic bomb was dropped on them. A new Firestorm resulted, a fusion of the two heroes: this new Firestorm was composed of Ronnie Raymond and the Russian Mikhail Arkadin but controlled by the disembodied amnesiac mind of Martin Stein.Firestorm Vol. 2 #67. DC Comics.Firestorm Vol. 2 #68. DC Comics.Firestorm Vol. 2 #69. DC Comics. The Firestorm with Arkadin proved to be a transitional phase, as in 1989 Ostrander fundamentally changed the character of Firestorm by revealing that Firestorm was a \\"Fire Elemental\\". Firestorm now became something of an environmental crusader, formed from Ronnie Raymond, Mikhail Arkadin and Svarozhich, a Soviet clone of the previous Firestorm, but with a new mind. Professor Stein, no longer part of the composite at all, continued to play a role, but the focus was on this radically different character. New artist Tom Mandrake would create a new look to match. It was during this phase that Firestorm met and befriended Sango and the Orishas, the elemental gods of Nigeria. He also met their chief deity and Sango's older brother Obatala, Lord of the White Cloth. By the series' 100th issue, Stein learned that he was destined to be the true Fire Elemental and would have been were it not for Raymond also being there by circumstance. Raymond and Arkadin were returned to their old lives, and Stein as Firestorm was accidentally exiled to deep space in the process of saving the Earth. He thereafter spent many years traveling through space as a wanderer, returning to Earth only rarely. In the 2006 miniseries Infinite Crisis it was revealed that Martin Stein, alive in space as the \\"Elemental Firestorm\\", had sensed the presence of Jason Rusch within the Firestorm Matrix, but was unaware of Ronnie Raymond's final demise. When Jason, as Firestorm, was gravely wounded in the line of duty, Stein linked with him in a variation of the merge, promising Jason a new Firestorm body to let him return into battle (although Martin had been unable to save Mick) and asking him about Ronnie's fate. Accepting Martin's proposal, Jason asked Stein to become the permanent second member of the Firestorm matrix. Sensing his \\"errors\\" (including Mick's death) were the result of his youth and lack of experience, he sought the experience and maturity of Stein. Stein refused at first, but later accepted Jason's request, thus ensuring both a new Firestorm body and the reconstruction of human bodies for both Rusch and Stein. It was revealed in Infinite Crisis that if the Multiverse had survived up to the present, Jason would have been a native of Earth-Eight.Johns, Geoff. Infinite Crisis #5 (April 2006). DC Comics. As the storyline jumped ahead a year (and the series itself was now re-titled as Firestorm the Nuclear Man from issue #23 on), Professor Stein has mysteriously vanished, and Jason Rusch has been merging with Firehawk to become Firestorm, allowing him to use her powers as well. The two decided to look for Stein together. Stein had been kidnapped and tortured by the Pupil, a former teaching assistant of Martin's. Flanked by the D.O.L.L.I.s, a group of cyborg soldiers of limited cognitive ability, the Pupil (formerly known as Adrian Burroughs) questioned the nearly dead Stein about the secrets of the universe. Jason and Lorraine, along with the mysterious teleport-er Gehenna, freed the captured Stein and restored him to full health. The Firestorm team of Jason and Firehawk made several appearances across the DC universe before the search for Martin Stein ended. Jason Rusch and Martin Stein meet Shilo Norman, and are attacked in succession by members of the New Gods such as Orion of New Genesis, Granny Goodness's Female Furies, and a greatly augmented Kalibak of Apokolips. Shilo informs Stein and Rusch that one-quarter of the Life Equation is hidden within the Firestorm Matrix. The others are held by Earth's other three Elementals (possibly the Red Tornado, Naiad, and the Swamp Thing). Darkseid fears that the Life Equation might challenge him and his Anti-Life Equation. Orion wished to keep Professor Stein safe, and Darksied's elite wished to secure the Matrix for Darkseid.As seen in Firestorm the Nuclear Man #33. DC Comics. The Lord of Evil descended upon them, ripped the professor from Rusch within the Matrix, then vanished without a trace. Jason, with Gehenna as a \\"hidden partner\\" in their fusion, began his search for the missing Dr. Stein. He returns in 2010‚Äì2011 Brightest Day miniseries, reuniting with an resurrecting Ronnie Raymond without them being fused. Brightest Day #1 (May 2010). DC Comics. While recovering in the hospital, Stein explains to Ronnie that it seems to be very dangerous to fuse into Firestorm again. Also, it is revealed that Ronnie, after quickly leaving the hospital and being threatened by Jason's father to stay away from Jason, lied to everyone, as he seems to perfectly remember murdering Gehenna as a Black Lantern.Brightest Day #3 (June 2010). DC Comics. As Firestorm, both Ronnie and Jason visit Stein in an attempt to find out what is happening to them. Stein reveals to them that the Black Lantern Firestorm still exists in the Firestorm Matrix. Firestorm is then told by the Entity that they must learn from each other and defeat the Black Lantern Firestorm before he destroys the Entity. Somehow, Jason and Ronnie trade places.Brightest Day #7 (August 2010). DC Comics. After running a test, Professor Stein reveals the origin of the Firestorm Matrix. Stein believes that during the initial experiment he was able to capture the spark that preceded the Big Bang that created our universe, thereby making the matrix a trigger for a new big bang. If the boys continue to experience emotional imbalance, they increase the likelihood of triggering a new big bang. After explaining this to the boys, the voice inside them speaks again. Declaring that it is not the matrix, a pair of black hands reaches out from inside Firestorm. Forcibly separating Jason and Ronnie, Black Lantern Firestorm stands between them, separate from both Ronnie and Jason and apparently calling itself \\"Deathstorm\\".Brightest Day #10 (September 2010). DC Comics. Deathstorm reveals its plan to Stein, stating that it intends to create enough emotional instability between Ronnie and Jason that the Matrix will trigger another Big Bang thereby destroying of all life in the universe. In order to help accomplish this goal, Deathstorm absorbs Stein's mind in order to use his knowledge of Ronnie against him.Brightest Day #11 (October 2010). DC Comics.

Writer/producer Dwayne McDuffie said the producers had permission from DC Comics to use the character but the show's creators could not come up with a story that they liked, and revealed in Wizard magazine #197 that the producers intended to use the Ronnie Raymond / Martin Stein version as the focus character for the episode \\"The Greatest Story Never Told\\" but was replaced by Booster Gold. * Victor Garber reprise his roles as Martin Stein in the web series Vixen. * Martin Stein appears in Justice League Action, voiced by Stephen Tobolowsky. The origin story is very similar to the classic origin. When Stein had just turned on a nuclear reactor, some criminals went in to steal plutonium. The criminals had kidnapped Ronnie from a field trip as a hostage. The criminals decided to throw some grenades to blow the reactor up. In the blast, Ronnie and Stein were fused together, creating Firestorm. Firestorm first appears in \\"Nuclear Family Values\\" where Firestorm had to prevent the Nuclear Family from blowing up a nuclear plant. With Martin's guidance, Firestorm was able to shrink them down. Afterward, Firestorm is recruited into the Justice League. In the episode \\"Freezer Burn\\", Firestorm works with Batman where they fight Mr. Freeze who is freezing Gotham City with a special freeze gun on an airship that is powered by Killer Frost (Caitlin Snow). In the episode \\"Field Trip\\", Firestorm, Blue Beetle and Stargirl are given a tour of the Fortress of Solitude by Superman when General Zod, Ursa and Quex-Ul are accidentally freed. With Superman incapacitated, Firestorm with guidance from Martin works at making Kryptonite while Blue Beetle and Stargirl fight Zod's group. Firestorm transmutes some of the ice into Kryptonite which weakens the Kryptonian villains. In the episode \\"Double Cross\\", Firestorm assists Batman and Plastic Man in their plot to apprehend Deadshot. The episode \\"The Cube Root\\" revealed that Martin was a former college roommate of former child prodigy Michael Holt. Live-action Firestorm is featured in the CW's Arrowverse, with Professor Martin Stein portrayed by Victor Garber. His partners are Ronnie Raymond, as played by Robbie Amell, and Jax Jackson, as played by Franz Drameh. * Firestorm first appears on the 2014 series The Flash, with Ronnie Raymond and Professor Martin Stein as the two halves. Ronnie is an engineer at S.T.A.R. Labs and Caitlin's fianc√© while Professor Stein is the creator of the F.I.R.E.S.T.O.R.M. matrix. Ronnie is presumed deceased from the particle accelerator explosion while saving his co-workers' lives. However, he survived and merged with Stein, having the matrix on his persons, to become the entity later named Firestorm. The two spend months trapped together, with Stein in primary control of Firestorm, until Caitlin discovers information from Jason Rusch (Luc Roderique), Stein's old assistant. Harrison Wells manages to separate the two, and they eventually learn to control their shared powers. A scene introducing Firestorm's ability to manipulate matter was filmed but was ultimately cut due to time constraints. When a singularity threatens Central City, Firestorm flies into to disrupt the singularity, triggering the halves' separation but Barry Allen is only able to recover Stein while Ronnie is presumed dead. After the deaths of Eddie and Ronnie, Professor Stein becomes a member of Team Flash as the group's scientific advisor. Eventually, Stein begins exhibiting symptoms that the Firestorm matrix has become unstable without a partner, endangering his life. When Team Flash searches for a likely candidate among people who have been affected by the dark matter explosion in a similar manner who also possess the same blood type, Jax Jackson ultimately becomes the new partner. A former high school football star (like Ronnie in the comics), Jax gets injured by the particle accelerator explosion, ending his collegiate career before starting. Jax is hesitant at first to become Firestorm's new half but agrees when the only other candidate uses the powers for revenge. Jax and Stein later leave Central City to train in using their Firestorm powers. When Barry, Cisco and Harry Wells travel to Earth-2, Deathstorm (Ronnie Raymond's Earth-2 counterpart) is encountered. In addition to being Killer Frost's significant other, Deathstorm is Ronnie in control as he has not let his partner out in years and can no longer hear him. When Deathstorm and his boss Reverb nearly kills Barry, Zoom kills Reverb and Deathstorm both, leaving Killer Frost to mourn Ronnie's death. * Firestorm also appears in the spin-off Legends of Tomorrow, with Martin Stein and Jax Jackson as the two halves while Graeme McComb portrays the former's younger incarnation. In season one, Jax initially does not want to participate in Rip Hunter's mission, to the extent that Stein has to knock him out to get on board the timeship. Eventually, Jax starts to appreciate being part of the team. During a trip to 1986, Stein is forcibly merged with Valentina Vostok to create a Soviet Firestorm, but he is able to break free of the sociopathic villain with Jax's encouragement; the separation and improper merge trigger an explosion that apparently kills Vostok. The season one finale introduces Firestorm's ability to transmute matter, subsequently turning a meteor into water before Vandal Savage could use it as part of a complex plan to undo history. In season two, Stein briefly takes on the role of team leader, before handing the reins to Sara Lance. During a trip to 1987, Stein has an encounter with his younger self, during which he berates his younger self for his attitude towards his wife. When Stein returns to the present in the \\"Invasion\\" crossover, he discovers that the exchange has led to him now having a daughter named Lily. Initially, Stein views Lily as a temporal paradox, but eventually becomes close and protective to Lily and thus accepting his new life as a parent. By season three, Stein has become a grandfather after Lily has Ronnie (named after his original Firestorm partner), prompting Jax to ask Ray Palmer for help in working out how they might separate the Firestorm matrix so that Jax can channel the power on his own. During the \\"Crisis on Earth-X\\" crossover, Stein is badly injured trying to help the heroes escape Earth-X and Jax gets injured as well due to the connection of the Firestorm matrix. Stein sacrifices himself by drinking the formula created to separate the Firestorm matrix, saving Jax's life. Afterwards, Jax, still distraught over Stein's death, attempts to change history when he comes in contact with a version of Stein from 1992 that has been displaced into the eleventh century, but the younger Stein rejects the offer to avoid the risk of negatively changing history, prompting Jax to depart the Legends to heal from his grief. Jax returns in season three's finale to help the Legends in the final battle against the demon Mallus. This version of Jax is presented as having been away from the team for five years, now happily married with a daughter named Martina after his deceased partner. =Video games= Martin Stein appears in Injustice 2, voiced by Fred Tatasciore. In the game, he and Jason's form of Firestorm is an ally of Batman, helping restore order to the planet after High Councilor Superman's defeat. They and Blue Beetle are selected by Batman to guard Superman's cell at the Lex Luthor Memorial Prison from the remaining Regime members and Brainiac's forces. When they start to get overwhelmed, Firestorm threatens to destroy the facility with their nuclear power but refrain after Batman arrives and frees Superman. Afterward, Batman chastises the duo for their recklessness and has them create a golden shard of Kryptonite to use in case Superman goes rogue again. They are later brainwashed into serving Brainiac but are saved by Batman and Superman. In their ending, Firestorm tries overheating the Skull Ship's engines to defeat Brainiac but the process causes the ship to explode and destroy the thousands of the collected worlds within. Though they know the heroes will never look at them the same way again after their mistake, they still pledge their loyalty to help Batman if needed.

Iaconelli competes on Major League Fishing. As of February 11, 2019, Mike's career tournament winnings with B.A.S.S. were $2,500,205, which includes 7 wins. Iaconelli's major accomplishments include the longest active streak of Bassmaster Classic qualifications with 17 consecutive appearances, the 2017 Major League Fishing Summit Cup Champion, 2003 Bassmaster Classic champion, as well as the 2006 Toyota Tundra Angler of the Year. Iaconelli is the only angler to have won the Bassmaster Classic, Bassmaster Angler of the Year and B.A.S.S. Nation Championship. Early life and education Iaconelli was born in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He grew up living with his mother, his uncle and his grandparents. At a young age, Iaconelli was introduced to fishing on summer trips to the Pocono Mountains. On these trips, he was first introduced to other types of fishing besides bass fishing. His first experiences were with trout and various panfish species. His first largemouth bass catch came at age twelve during his family's annual summer trek to the Pocono Mountains. Iaconelli used a 9S Floating Rapala lure to catch the bass. According to Iaconelli, this moment sparked his interest in bass fishing. His love for bass fishing continued on into high school. Career =Early career= After high school, Iaconelli founded the bass fishing club, \\"Top Rod Bassmasters\\". Top Rod Bassmasters became Iaconelli's first venture into competitive bass fishing. The club had inter-club tournaments among its members. In 1992, after three years of fishing in Top Rod Bassmasters, Iaconelli made the transition to the pro-am circuit. His first tournament on this circuit was the North Carolina Top 100. This event was held on Lake Norman in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. In this tournament, Iaconelli drew widely known fisherman, Tommy Biffle. In the following days of the North Carolina Top 100, he would also draw well-known fishermen David Fritts and Gary Klein. In 1994, Iaconelli once again fished the North Carolina Top 100 on Lake Norman. At this tournament, he won his first bass boat. The boat he won was a new Ranger 374. After Iaconelli won a Ranger 374, he began to tackle the Red Man and Bass Anglers Sportsman Society (B.A.S.S.) Federation trails. In 1997, Iaconelli fished a B.A.S.S. Invitational Tournament on Buggs Island, also known as Kerr Lake. The first day, he was paired with the four-time Bassmaster Classic champion, Kevin VanDam. One of Iaconelli's earliest tournament victories came on New Jersey's Lake Hopatcong. In this Federation tournament, he broke the lake and one-day Federation record of just over 18 pounds. His official weight for that tournament was 19.58 lbs. In 1999, Iaconelli qualified for the Bassmaster Federation Nationals on the Red River. He would go on to win the event as he qualified for the 1999 Bassmaster Classic berth after the victory. The 1999 Bassmaster Classic was held on the Louisiana Delta in New Orleans, Louisiana. At the 1999 Bassmaster Classic, Classic rookie Iaconelli caught a three-day total of 39 lbs and 12 oz. That total netted him a sixth-place finish. The great finish at the Bassmaster Classic culminated in Dick's Sporting Goods and Daiwa becoming major sponsors for Iaconelli. In September of the same year, Iaconelli collected his first victory in the professional ranks by winning the Bassmaster Vermont Top 150 on Lake Champlain. Michael Iaconelli bagged over 61 lbs of bass and a $100,000 check. In 2000, Iaconelli made the leap to the professional ranks. He began fishing the B.A.S.S Tour. Again, Iaconelli qualified for the Bassmaster Classic. The 2000 Bassmaster Classic was held on Lake Michigan in Chicago, Illinois. He was able to net a top finish with a three-day weight total of 20 lbs 1 oz. In 2002, Iaconelli started the season with a victory on Lake Seminole. The victory on Lake Seminole was the first Tour level victory for Iaconelli. He qualified for the 2003 Bassmaster Classic after a ninth-place victory at the B.A.S.S. Invitational on Lake Ontario. =2003 to present= The months prior to the 2003 Bassmaster Classic on the Louisiana Delta saw Iaconelli file for divorce from his wife. This event led Iaconelli to seriously consider retiring from competitive bass fishing. During practice, Iaconelli traveled down to the Venice, Louisiana pool where he found the backwater pond nicknamed \\"the Heart\\". This location was the area Iaconelli fished in during the 2003 Bassmaster Classic. On Day One of the Bassmaster Classic, Iaconelli caught over 15 lbs. This weight put Iaconelli in second- place after Day One just over a pound behind Day One leader Mark Menendez. On Day Two of the Bassmaster Classic, Iaconelli vaulted into first-place with a five bass limit weighing 11 lbs and 14 oz. On Day Three, Iaconelli weighed in 10 lbs 14 oz to win his first Bassmaster Classic. His three-day total was 37 lbs and 14 oz. Iaconelli's Bassmaster Classic winning fish was captured on camera. Iaconelli's winning catch has been replayed on ESPN Classic. That notable moment featured Iaconelli capturing the winning fish. After he landed the bass, Iaconelli exclaimed, \\"Never give up! Never give up, man!\\" Iaconelli was also awarded a $200,000 purse for his Bassmaster Classic victory. After winning the Bassmaster Classic, Iaconelli continued fishing professionally. He recorded a fourth-place finish on the Harris Chain of Lakes in Leesburg, Florida in his first Bassmaster Tour event since his Bassmaster Classic victory on the Louisiana Delta. This top-five finish on the Harris Chain of Lakes was the first of three top-ten finishes for Iaconelli. At the third Bassmaster Tour event on Lake Guntersville, he recorded a fifth-place finish. His third top-ten finish of the 2004 season occurred at Smith Mountain Lake. At Smith Mountain Lake, Iaconelli recorded an eighth-place victory. Iaconelli qualified for the 2004 Bassmaster Classic on Lake Wylie. However, Iaconelli was not able to repeat as Bassmaster Classic champion. He finished 19th with a three-day total weight of 20 lbs and 13 oz. In 2005, Iaconelli recorded five top-ten finishes on the Bassmaster and Elite 50 Tours. The 2005 Bassmaster Classic was held on the Allegheny River, Monongahela River and Ohio River. There, he recorded a fifth-place finish. He finished a pound and ten ounces behind the 2005 Bassmaster Classic champion, Kevin Vandam. Iaconelli started off the 2006 season with a career-low 51st-place finish at the Bassmaster Classic on Lake Tohopekaliga. For the remainder of the 2006 season, he recorded top-twenty finishes in seven of the eight Elite Series events. One of his top-twenty finishes of the 2006 season included a victory at the Bassmaster Elite Series Southern Challenge on Lake Guntersville. Iaconelli would go on to win the 2006 Toyota Tundra Angler of the Year award. Also in 2006, Iaconelli was named one of the 10 most hated athletes by GQ magazine.GQ At the 2006 Bassmaster Classic, Iaconelli's boat had aerator issues in its livewells. The aerator issues resulted in his two fish dying. As a result, Iaconelli, out of frustration, broke the light pole on his bass boat. This resulted in his Day Two disqualification from the 2006 Bassmaster Classic. In 2007, Iaconelli was not able to repeat as the Toyota Tundra Angler of the Year. He only recorded one top-ten finish throughout the entire 2007 season. The 2008 season began with a tenth-place finish on Lake Hartwell. Iaconelli did not record another top ten finish until the Bassmaster Elite Series Tennessee Triumph on Old Hickory Lake. There he finished in ninth place. From there, he went on to finish fifth and third at the Bassmaster Elite Series Empire Chase and the Bassmaster Elite Series Empire Chase respectively.

He was the runner-up to Skeet Reese by 11 ounces. Iaconelli would start the 2009 Elite Series season with top-ten finishes at Lake Amistad and Wheeler Lake. In August 2009, Iaconelli again finished runner-up in a championship tournament. At the Forrest L. Wood (FLW) Cup, he finished second to Greg Hackney by 3 ounces. Iaconelli's 2010 season began at the Bassmaster Classic on Lay Lake in Birmingham, Alabama. He posted a sixth-place finish with 37 lbs and 6 oz. Iaconelli's other lone top ten finish of the season came on the California Delta. At the 2011 Bassmaster Classic held on the Louisiana Delta, Iaconelli posted an eleventh-place finish. Following the Elite Series tournament on Lake Guntersville (Al.), Iaconelli had surgery at the Huntsville Orthopaedic Clinic to remove blood pooling in his right calf. Iaconelli finished 12th in the Guntersville event despite fishing the entire tournament with the injured leg. Iaconelli said he believes the injury occurred during the Sabine River tournament the previous week while he was changing a prop.12 Mike won the 2014 Bassmaster Elites at Delaware River, on his home water near Philadelphia. Iaconelli co-founded The Bass University with fellow professional bass angler Peter Gluszek in 2009.

Dob√≥ was a member of the Hungarian land-owning nobility, with holdings in northern Hungary. In the dynastic succession struggles after the Battle of Moh√°cs in 1526, Dob√≥ was consistently on the side of the Habsburg King Ferdinand I rather than that of John Z√°polya. Life Dob√≥ was the son of Domonkos (Dominic) Dob√≥, who married Zs√≥fia (Sophie) C√©kei in 1498. There were six children from the marriage: Ferenc, L√°szl√≥, Istv√°n, Domokos, Anna and Katalin.

The program now airs on Outdoor Channel and Pursuit Channel; it has previously aired on Versus (formerly OLN/Outdoor Life Network), ESPN and TNN, The Nashville Network (now Spike TV). In 1983, Parker was named B.A.S.S. Angler of the Year. Parker also lent his name and likeness to a fishing video game titled Bassin's Black Bass with Hank Parker, released in 1994 for the Super NES, in which the player must earn their way onto the pro bass fishing tour in order, where they ultimately compete against Parker. Parker also tried to qualify in three NASCAR Busch Series races in 1994, but did not make any of them. Parker lives in Union County, South Carolina, with his wife, Martha. He has four sons: Hank Parker Jr. and Billy Parker, who have both driven in the NASCAR Busch Series, Ben Parker, who is fishing the 2015 Rayvoc FLW Series, Timothy Parker, who is a fighter on the MMA circuit, and a daughter named Lucy Parker who is a professional photographer, as well as a stepdaughter, Amy. Additionally, Hank and Martha have 11 grandchildren. Over the years, Hank has been honored by being inducted in the Bass Fishing Hall of Fame, the Legends of the Outdoors Hall of Fame and the International Game Fish Association Hall of Fame. After 30 years of television Hank's track record of integrity is shown in that he still has partnerships with many of the companies he started with including Ranger Boats, Mercury Marine and more.

He also had a longstanding involvement with the Olympic movement, as both an athlete and organiser. Kent Hughes was born in Melbourne to an upper middle- class family. He won a Rhodes Scholarship in 1914, but postponed his studies to join the Australian Army. He entered Christ Church, Oxford, in 1919, and combined his studies with his sporting career, representing Australia in hurdling at the 1920 Summer Olympics. Kent Hughes returned home in 1923 and began working at his father's publishing company. He was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1927, representing the Nationalist Party. He joined the new United Australia Party in 1931, and the following year was made a minister in the government of Stanley Argyle. He served as the party's deputy leader from 1935 to 1939. When World War II broke out, Kent Hughes re- enlisted in the army and joined the Malayan Campaign. He was captured by the Japanese at the Fall of Singapore, and spent the next three years as a prisoner-of-war in Singapore, Taiwan, and Manchuria. Kent Hughes retained his seat in parliament during that time, and joined the new Liberal Party upon his return to Australia in 1945. He became Deputy Premier of Victoria in 1948, but resigned the following year to contest the House of Representatives at the 1949 federal election. Robert Menzies added Kent Hughes to his cabinet in 1951, as Minister for the Interior and Minister for Works and Housing. Kent Hughes was Chairman of the Organising Committee for the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. His chairmanship was widely judged a success, and he left a lasting legacy by engineering the sale of television rights, an Olympic first. Despite his high profile, Menzies removed Kent Hughes from his ministry in early 1956. He spent the rest of his career as a backbencher, dying in office in 1970. Kent Hughes was famous for his stubbornness and abrasive personality, particularly the insults he directed at opponents. He was sympathetic towards fascism early in his career (generally overlooked due to his later status as a war hero), and later became an ardent anti-communist. Early life and family The second child of seven of English orthopaedic surgeon and publisher Wilfred Kent Hughes and his wife Clementina (n√©e Rankin), Kent Hughes was born in East Melbourne and educated at Trinity Grammar and Melbourne Grammar. He was accepted at Christ Church, Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar in 1914 (although he did not commence study at Oxford until 1919 due to his war service). The family name was Hughes, and young Wilfrid was usually called Bill or Billy. Later, to avoid confusion with fellow politician Billy Hughes, he adopted one of his middle names, Kent, as part of his surname. It is not known why he spelled his given name \\"Wilfrid\\" while his father's was \\"Wilfred.\\" A number of Kent Hughes's relatives also gained national recognition in their chosen fields. Uncle Canon Ernest Hughes was an influential member of the Anglican Church of Australia and a leading Australian rules footballer with St Kilda and EssendonHarper, N. (1983) \\"Hughes, Ernest Selwyn (1860‚Äì1942)\\", Australian Dictionary of Biography, Vol. 9. pp 388‚Äì389. Melbourne University Press: Parkdale. and uncle Frederic Hughes was a Brigadier-General, mayor of St Kilda and Aide-de-camp to the Governor- General, the Earl of Dudley.Smart, J. (1983) \\"Hughes, Frederic Godfrey (1858‚Äì1944)\\", Australian Dictionary of Biography, Vol. 9. pp 387‚Äì388. Melbourne University Press: Parkdale. Aunt Eva Hughes OBE founded the Australian Women's National League, the then largest body of organised women in the country, while his sisters Dr Ellen Kent Hughes MBE was a leading paediatrician and community activist and Gwendoline Kent Lloyd, who Wilfrid referred to as \\"the family Communist\\", was a renowned proponent of Indigenous rights. World War I Kent Hughes enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force as a private on 8 August 1914. (listed third from top) He served in the 3rd Light Horse Brigade at Gallipoli, where he was wounded, then Sinai, Palestine and Syria. Kent Hughes, who reached the rank of major, was mentioned in despatches four times, received the Military Cross in 1917 for his \\"marked ability and energy in the performance of his duties\\", and appointed Deputy Adjutant and Quartermaster General of the Australian Mounted Division. Upon his return to Australia in 1918 he published a volume of memoirs, Modern Crusaders, about his exploits in the Light Horse Brigade. University and 1920 Olympics At war's end, Kent Hughes entered Christ Church, Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, gaining a Bachelor of Arts with Honours in Modern History. He also captained the Oxford ski team and showed a proficiency for athletics, such that Kent Hughes was chosen to represent Australia in the 110 and 400 metre hurdles at the 1920 Summer Olympics. He finished fourth in his heat of the 110 metre hurdles and failed to progress but won his 400-metre heat before finishing fifth in the semi final. Kent Hughes did not return to England empty handed, as he later admitted to souveniring an official Olympic flag from the Olympic stadium.Findling, J. & Pelle, K. (2004) Encyclopedia of the Modern Olympic Movement, Greenwood Press. In 1921, Kent Hughes was part of the Oxford Ski Team visit to Europe, during which he became the first Australian to ski competitively overseas. Following his graduation from Oxford, he married Edith Kerr, a wealthy American heiress to a thread manufacturing empire, on 3 February 1923 in Montclair, New Jersey. He subsequently returned to Melbourne to work as a director in his father's publishing company Ramsay Publishing Pty Ltd while sizing up a career in politics. State politics Major Kent Hughes (right) in Palestine with the 3rd Light Horse Brigade. In 1926 Kent Hughes unsuccessfully sought Nationalist Party of Australia preselection for the newly created seat of Kew in the Victorian Legislative Assembly before winning the seat as an Independent candidate at the 1927 election, after which he joined the Nationalists. Kent Hughes soon found himself opposed to the conservative establishment and what he considered the mediocrity of Victorian politics. He openly referred to a number of his fellow Nationalists as \\"boneheads\\" and opposition Labor Party members as \\"uncouth, semi-educated ill-mannered narrow-minded boors\\". Kent Hughes, along with his close friend and ally Robert Menzies, founded the Young Nationalists Organisation in 1929, which became an influential force in conservative politics in Victoria. When the Nationalists came into power in December 1928, Kent Hughes was appointed Cabinet Secretary and Government Whip but resigned his positions in July 1929, ostensibly in protest over a government subsidy to a freezing works company but more likely in reaction to the ongoing boneheadedness of his fellow parliamentarians. Following the formation of the United Australia Party (UAP) in place of the Nationalists in 1931, Kent Hughes served in several portfolios, including Railways, Labour, Transport and Sustenance. It was as Minister for Sustenance, a portfolio designed to deal with the poverty of the Great Depression, that he became known as the \\"Minister for Starvation\\".Spenceley, G. (2001) \\"The minister for starvation: Wilfrid Kent Hughes, fascism and the Unemployment Relief\\", Labour History, Australian Society for the Study of Labour History. Vol. 81. Kent Hughes drafted legislation that became the Unemployment Relief (Administration) Bill, which when enacted in January 1933, forced the unemployed to work for the dole and denied any form of financial assistance to women.Stone, J. (1998) \\"Brazen Hussies and God's Police\\", Rebel Women in Australian Working Class History, ed. Bloodworth, S. & O'Lincoln, T. Interventions: Melbourne. Kent Hughes's bill has been described as the harshest piece of legislation in Australia directed towards the unemployed during the Depression. In January 1933 Kent Hughes became embroiled in cricket's Bodyline affair. A friend of English captain Douglas Jardine from their Oxford days, Kent Hughes publicly defended Jardine's tactics of sustained short pitched bowling against the Australian batsmen, arguing that Australia used similar tactics against England during the 1921 Ashes tour. He also criticised the protests of Australian cricket's governing body, the Australian Cricket Board of Control towards Jardine, stating they were \\"boorish, bitter (and) insulting\\".________ \\"The Leg Theory\\", The Times, London, 20 January 1933, p 6 While he was attacking the Cricket Board of Control, Kent Hughes was simultaneously organising the Australian tour of the Duke of Gloucester, and for his efforts was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order in 1934. In 1938 he was manager of the Australian team at the Empire Games held in Sydney. =\\"Why I Have Become a Fascist\\"= The \\"Why I have Become a Fascist\\" article During the late 1920s and 1930s Kent Hughes developed a strong sympathy for fascism, encouraged in part by his uncle Ernest, who visited Italy in 1926 and published an enthusiastic report on Mussolini's Italy in a local newspaper on his return. Kent Hughes was also impressed by Sir Oswald Mosley's proposal for a British parliament consisting of business and national interests and headed by a powerful executive government. In 1933 he published a series of articles in the Melbourne Herald, titled \\"Why I Have Become a Fascist.\\" In one article he wrote that fascism \\"endeavours to avoid the egotistical attitude of laissez faire and the inertia of socialism.\\" Kent Hughes saw it as \\"a half-way house between the two systems.\\" In fascist countries, he said, \\"industrial peace and security have been found to be worth the price of sacrificing some of the individual liberty previously enjoyed.\\" In what he called \\"British communities,\\" however, he expected that fascism would \\"be garbed not in the dictatorial black shirt, but in the more sedate style of the British Parliamentary representative.\\"Howard, F. (1972) Kent Hughes, Macmillan. Kent Hughes was unique among prominent Australians in publicly identifying as a fascist, although he never joined a fascist organisation or acted overtly in a way that could be described as fascist and there is no evidence to suggest he was an anti-semite. His biographer Frederick Howard maintains that Kent Hughes did not know much about fascism and used the word mainly for its shock value. \\"Kent Hughes does not seem to have paid enough attention to the difference between theory and practice in Mussolini's Italy,\\" he observes. Kent Hughes's public support of fascism failed to damage his political career, as he was elected Victorian Deputy Leader of the UAP in 1935, serving until his enlistment in the army in 1939. World War II and aftermath Lieutenant Colonel Kent Hughes (right) with his Aide de Camp Gordon Walker (left) in Kuala Lumpur, 1941 In 1939, without resigning from Parliament, Kent Hughes rejoined the Army, becoming a colonel in the 8th Division. He served in the Malaya campaign of 1942, where he was again mentioned in despatches. Kent Hughes was taken prisoner by the Japanese in Singapore and was kept in the Changi Prisoner Of War camp, where he was beaten and half-starved. In 1943 he was shipped as a slave labourer to Taiwan. In October 1944 he was shipped to Japan and on to Korea, and then sent by rail to Mukden in Manchuria, where prisoners of war were put to work in arms factories. In August 1945 Kent Hughes was liberated by the invading Red Army and returned to Australia with an amoebic complaint that would continue to bother him. While imprisoned, Kent Hughes secretly wrote what became Slaves of the Samurai, a colourful account of his wartime experiences, published in 1946. He also took up the case of Australian General Gordon Bennett, who was accused of cowardice and desertion after leaving Singapore without authorisation shortly before the city surrendered to the Japanese. Kent Hughes appeared before the Royal Commission into Bennett's case, and argued that Bennett was correct to avoid being taken prisoner and return to Australia to continue the fight. Appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1947 for his wartime service,Papers of Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes (1895‚Äì1970) ‚Äì MS 4856. Held at the National Library of Australia Retrieved 10 June 2006. Kent Hughes was very popular with the ex-service community, appearing in the ANZAC Day march in April each year on horseback, in his World War I uniform, and campaigning for improved benefits for ex-servicemen, particularly ex- prisoners of war. He returned to politics after the end of World War II and followed most of the UAP into the newly created Liberal Party. He served as Deputy Premier, Minister for Transport and Minister for Public Instruction from 1947 to 1949, as well as Chief Secretary and Minister for Electrical Undertakings in 1948. Federal politics In 1949, Kent Hughes decided to transfer to federal politics. The bulk of his state electorate was within the comfortably safe Liberal federal seat of Kooyong, but that was held by his old colleague Menzies, now the federal leader of the Liberal Party. Instead, Kent Hughes opted to stand in Chisholm, a newly created seat in south-east Melbourne that was just as safe as Kooyong. Duly elected, he was appointed Minister for the Interior and Minister for Works and Housing (Minister for Works from June 1952) under Menzies. Kent Hughes complained that he was left in charge of only trifling issues. =1956 Olympics= Following the successful bid by Melbourne to host the 1956 Summer Olympics, problems had beset the organising of the Games to the extent that International Olympic Committee President Avery Brundage threatened to award the Games to another city.Peterson, D. (1996) \\"The Games in our times\\", Daily Telegraph, 13 July 1996, p 36. In response, the Melbourne Organising Committee approached Kent Hughes in 1951 to be its chairman, believing his public stature, Olympian background and experience in administration would be great assets.Barney, R. & Wenn, S. (2004) \\"Nothing in Hand but Billions in Precedent\\", Journal of Olympic History, Vol. 12, No. 1, International Society of Olympic Historians: Cologne. Kent Hughes took to the Chairman role with gusto, although his relationship with Brundage was never cordial. During a visit to Melbourne in 1955 to inspect the preparations, Brundage was less than impressed with the progress achieved under Kent Hughes's chairmanship and condemned Kent Hughes's apparent lack of concern at the looming deadline for the Games. Not one to take criticism lightly, Kent Hughes was quoted as saying that he had enough to worry about without having \\"Chicago blow-ins come out here and blow their tops over nothing in particular and annoy everyone in general.\\" Kent Hughes broke Olympic tradition in two significant ways. He decided to charge for television and newsreel footage of the Games where previously footage was provided free of charge. Secondly, following a suggestion from John Ian Wing, a 17-year-old apprentice carpenter from Melbourne, Kent Hughes instigated the now familiar closing ceremony tradition of the athletes of different nations parading together, instead of with their national teams, as a symbol of world unity. Kent Hughes's plan to charge for television and newsreel footage of the Games was strongly opposed in many circles, including the media, who believed that the Games were news and as such should be free, while Australian government authorities thought that providing free television coverage of the Games would lead to greater tourism opportunities. Brundage made no public comment on television rights for the Games but grasped the financial possibilities of charging for rights, devising a television rights fees policy following the Games, whereby television stations were forced to negotiate for televised rights for all future Games. This policy is believed to have netted the IOC over $12 billion since its inception at the 1960 Summer Olympics. In recognition of his work successfully organising the Games Kent Hughes was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1957. An award presented by the Victorian Olympic Council to the athlete it considers to have given the most outstanding performance at a Games is named in his honour and Kent Hughes's significance to the modern Olympic movement is such that it has been suggested that an oil portrait of Kent Hughes be commissioned and placed in the Olympic Museum in Lausanne. =Later years= Menzies dropped Kent Hughes from cabinet in 1956, ostensibly because Menzies opposed some of his housing plans for Canberra. However, it was more likely due to Kent Hughes's continued public comments on foreign affairs and defence matters,Whitington, D. (1964) The Rulers, Lansdowne Press, Melbourne. in which he took an independent line favouring a policy even more anti-Communist than that of Menzies, higher defence spending and the reintroduction of conscription. Widely renowned as the parliamentary figure most knowledgeable in Asian affairs, Kent Hughes was a leading member of the \\"Taiwan lobby\\" in the Liberal Party, which sought to maintain the recognition of Taiwan as the official representative of China,Hancock, p. 67. and met several times with Chiang Kai- shek.________ \\"Sir W Kent Hughes\\", The Times, London, 1 August 1970, p 14 Following the unexpected death of Prime Minister Harold Holt in 1967, Kent Hughes was one of a number of Liberal politicians who expressed support for Country Party leader (and acting Prime Minister) John McEwen remaining Prime Minister ahead of any of his fellow Liberal Party parliamentarians.Abjorensen, p. 122. As it turned out, Liberal Party member John Gorton was selected as the new Liberal parliamentary leader and Prime Minister.Abjorensen, p. 123. He remained very popular in his electorate, and served in Parliament until his death in 1970. Survived by his wife and three daughters, Kent Hughes was accorded a State Funeral. The Times obituary highlighted his war service and Olympian status, referring to him as \\"one of the more colourful Australian parliamentarians\\". Sources * Abjorensen, N.

The site is located near the section of the Holston River once referred to as the Great Falls. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, but subsequently removed in 2017. History After immigrating from Ireland, John Beauregard Barnes and his wife, Emaline Baker Barnes, owned 2000 acres (809 hectares) of land in east Tennessee around the time of the American Civil War. In 1860, Barnes constructed the two-story house from hand-fired brick on the site. The Barnes' slaves, brought from Ireland, would be hidden in the cellar of the house when Union soldiers or sympathizers were near the property. In addition, the family frequently caught runaway slaves and housed them in the cellar until their owners claimed them. The house was inherited by the children of John Beauregard Barnes. A son, John Rice Barnes, and his wife, Elizabeth Hawk Barnes, raised their family of 12 children in the house. In addition to being a farmer, J. R. Barnes was a logger who cut and floated timber on the Holston River to Knoxville, accompanying the timber on the river in a flatboat. The house has since had several owners including the Tennessee Valley Authority. The property is currently owned by Jim Pearson and his wife. Architectural details The house is constructed from hand-fired brick. A chimney with decorative brickwork is located at each end of the house. The meanings of the initials on the chimneys (E.B. and L.L.) are not precisely known. The house has a total of five fireplaces. The house contains two cellars. One of the two cellars is dirt-walled and contains a fireplace for smoking meats and chains for restraining slaves. A rear wing with five rooms was added to the house during the occupancy by the family of John Rice Barnes. This addition was removed in 1955.

Career Born in the Sydney suburb of Lakemba, Cook attended Fort Street High School. After leaving school he worked around Australia in a variety of jobs including laboratory technician, journalist and television documentary-maker, and boatshed operator. In 1966, with businessman Gordon Barton, Cook founded a new political party, the Liberal Reform Group. Cook was vehemently opposed to the Vietnam War, and stood (unsuccessfully) as an LRG candidate for the seat of Parramatta in the 1966 federal election. A keen amateur lepidopterist, Cook established the first butterfly farm in Australia on the banks of Sydney's Hawkesbury River in the 1970s. Several of Cook's novels were adapted for the screen. Wake in Fright was filmed in 1971 by Ted Kotcheff, starring Donald Pleasence and Gary Bond (released under the title Outback in Europe and the US). Stockade was filmed by Ross McGregor and Hans Pomeranz, also in 1971. In 1976 The Bushranger was made into a telemovie, starring Leonard Teale, John Hamblin and Kate Fitzpatrick. Cook also wrote one episode of the Australian TV children's adventure series The Rovers (1970). In 2007 Cook's novel The Man Underground was adapted as a radio drama by ABC Radio National. A 72-minute audio interview with Cook by Hazel de Berg was recorded in 1972, in which he discusses his family, his work for the ABC, the background to Wake in Fright, his ventures into film production and his novels. The interview is preserved in the collection of the National Library of Australia. He also wrote novels under the pseudonyms Alan Hale and John Duffy.Jacqueline Kent, Beyond Words: A Year with Kenneth Cook Cook's literary estate is managed by Curtis Brown Australia.

With great skill and tenacity, he was the first idol of Corinthians, being the first player to get a statue in the team's gardens (in 1929). As of 2006, Neco is the player who played the longest for Corinthians: 17 years. Called often to the Brazilian national team, he won two South American Championships: 1919 (team's top scorer) and 1922 (top scorer). Playing for Corinthians, he won the Paulista League eight times as a player (being top scorer in 1914 and 1920) and once as a coach (1937). Neco had a quick temper and frequently got involved in fights; his second stint as a manager occurred because he was suspended as a player for 18 games when he beat a referee. He started in the third team of Corinthians at the age of 16 and joined the first team in 1913 (the first year Corinthians participated in official competitions). In 1915, Corinthians did not play official games because of political issues and almost went bankrupt; this year, Neco played friendlies for Corinthians and the official games for Mackenzie. During this time, he broke into the Corinthians building to retrieve books that the landlord had locked inside due to non-payment of the rent. After scoring two goals playing for Brazil against Uruguay in the 2x2 tie valid for the 1919 South American Championship in Rio de Janeiro, Neco returned to his regular job as a carpenter in S√£o Paulo and was fired for missing work.

They play in the fourth tier of the English rugby union league hierarchy and have played in National League 2 North since season 2013‚Äì14. The Tigers nickname is due to their striped kit. History Sedgley Park is a district of Prestwich approximately two miles north of Manchester city centre. In 1932 at a public meeting in a temperance bar, the club began. The very first ground was a farmer's field in Whitefield, and the club has never been based in Sedgley Park. Despite primitive conditions - cowshed for changing, farmyard pump for washing - the new club thrived. A clubhouse had already been built and three regular teams were being fielded before World War II broke out in 1939. They survived the war years, and also a difficult period afterward when they lost their rented ground. For two years all games were played away, with barely enough playing members for two teams, until in 1955 they moved to their present site, Park Lane in Whitefield, with an immediate and spectacular improvement in playing standards. During the next twenty years Sedgley Park became a successful and respected junior club but, in the years before league rugby, advancement was practically impossible, especially for a club notorious for its muddy pitches; they were often nicknamed 'Sludgley Park' by other teams! The decision to build a large, two-story clubhouse was arguably the most significant one in their history. Building began in 1978 at a time when the club was enjoying great success on the field, and was completed in time for the 1982 Golden Jubilee season; it had been a risky venture at the time, but it set them apart from all the local junior clubs. When the Courage Leagues began in 1987 they had progressed far enough to be placed in North West 2 (level 8), from which they gained promotion at the first attempt. They remained in North West 1 for seven years; meanwhile, the club was expanding in other directions with a huge increase in quantity and quality at the age-group level of the game. When the game went 'open' in the middle 1990s, Sedgley Park was ready for the next leap forward. Promotion was achieved three years in succession; the clubhouse was extended; the two pitches became one, now in excellent condition, with floodlights and terracing. A newly purchased field, just across the road, provided three more much needed pitches and floodlit training. Team bus, 15 May 2008 Another promotion, in 2001, took them to National League Two, level 3 of the English game. The Tigers attained League One status in 2004, their 6th promotion since 1987, but were relegated back to level three in 2009.

Boris Lehman Lehman initially studied piano, but in the early 1960s became interested in photography and cinema. In 1966, after graduating in Film Studies from the Institut National Sup√©rieur des Arts du spectacle, Brussels, he became a film enthusiast and critic, contributing reviews to weekly publications and magazines. He began making films between 1965 and 1983 when working for Club Antonin Artaud, a readjustment day centre for the mentally ill, using cinema as a therapeutic tool with patients. He later founded the film-based organisations Cin√©libre, Cin√©dit, and AJC, the young filmmakers' workshop. He has assisted Henri Storck with the films Secret Forest of Africa and F√™tes de Belgique, and Chantal Akerman with Jeanne Dielman. He has also collaborated with filmmakers Patrick Van Antwerpen, Jean- Marie Buchet and G√©rard Courant. As an actor, Lehman has played roles in Brussels-transit (dir. Samy Szlingerbaum 1980), Canal K (dir. Maurice Rabinowicz 1970), and Les Filles en Orange (dir. Ya√´l Andr√© 2003). Initially working with amateurs, he has produced 400 films in Super 8, 16 mm or video, as either shorts, features, documentaries, journals or autobiographies, and has shot 300,000 photographs.

The RF node with three antennas was at the platform and another antenna near the stairs on the far side. A distributed antenna system, or DAS, is a network of spatially separated antenna nodes connected to a common source via a transport medium that provides wireless service within a geographic area or structure. DAS antenna elevations are generally at or below the clutter level, and node installations are compact. A distributed antenna system may be deployed indoors (an iDAS) or outdoors (an oDAS). Concept As illustrated in the figure, the idea is to split the transmitted power among several antenna elements, separated in space so as to provide coverage over the same area as a single antenna but with reduced total power and improved reliability. A single antenna radiating at high power (a) is replaced by a group of low-power antennas to cover the same area (b). The idea was described in a paper by Saleh et al.A. A. M. Saleh, A. J. Rustako and R. S. Roman, Distributed Antennas for Indoor Radio Communications, IEEE Transactions on Commun., vol. 35, pp. 1245-1251, Dec. 1987 in 1987. These antennas have recently been employed by several service providers in many areas around the United States. DAS is often used in scenarios where alternate technologies are infeasible due to terrain or zoning challenges. The idea works because less power is wasted in overcoming penetration and shadowing losses, and because a line-of-sight channel is present more frequently, leading to reduced fade depths and reduced delay spread. A distributed antenna system can be implemented using passive splitters and feeders, or active-repeater amplifiers can be included to overcome the feeder losses. In systems where equalization is applied, it may be desirable to introduce delays between the antenna elements. This artificially increases delay spread in areas of overlapped coverage, permitting quality improvements via time diversity. If a given area is covered by many distributed antenna elements rather than a single antenna, then the total radiated power is reduced by approximately a factor N1‚Äìn/2 and the power per antenna is reduced by a factor Nn/2 where a simple power-law path-loss model with path-loss exponent n is assumed. As an alternative, the total area covered could be extended for a given limit of effective radiated power, which may be important to ensure compliance with safety limits on radiation into the human body. Precursors Prior to the invention by Saleh et al., tunnel transmitters and leaky feeders had been used to provide radio reception in tunnels, mines, subway lines, and other indoor and underground spaces.  Use in WiFi networks  Using a distributed antenna system to create an area of wireless coverage, it is possible to use this technique to propagate indoor WiFi for commercial uses. It is estimated that only about 5% of commercial WiFi use a distributed antenna system.  Placement of distributed antenna systems  Distributed antenna systems may be placed inside buildings for increasing wireless signals within buildings. Often they are placed within large structures such as stadiums or corporate headquarters. Systems are also placed in the utility right of way on top of utility poles, street light poles and traffic signal poles.  Regulations  = United States = Historical regulatory challenges arise at the federal, state and municipal levels. However, regulations have been getting promulgated at the state and federal level, with Midwest states leading the way with state level regulations. Industry resources like The HetNet Forum (formerly The DAS Forum) also address regulatory issues in their conferences and communicate the outcome through their websites. Federal Communications Commission Rules: The FCC has promulgated the FCC Pole Attachment Order 11-50. Michigan: The METRO Authority, which regulates access to the utility right-of-way determined in 2004 that Distributed Antennae Network Systems are part of the landline infrastructure, and hence are subject to state regulation via an administrative determination. Ohio: The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio has issued a pole attachment rulings which require the utility to allow Distributed Antenna Systems in the utility right-of-way in August 2014.

During his career, McCann played in the Scottish Premier League for Heart of Midlothian as well as having spells in both the Scottish and English football leagues. Career =Scotland= McCann started his career with Wolves Boys Club in GlasgowNottscountyfc.co.uk and then became an apprentice with Scottish League First Division Airdrieonians in 1997. Primarily considered a left fullback, he has on occasion played as a wingback or even in left midfield. He spent 3 successful seasons with Airdrie, playing 97 times and scoring 9 goals while gaining a reputation as an exciting young talent. His form attracted the attention of Premier League side Heart of Midlothian, who were seeking a replacement for the recently sold Gary Naysmith, and he moved to the Edinburgh club in February 2001. McCann struggled to maintain a regular place in the Hearts' side during his three seasons at Tynecastle, as firstly the veteran Stephane Mah√©, then latterly converted right back Alan Maybury, were preferred in the left back berth by manager Craig Levein. Consequently, Austin appeared a mere 39 times for Hearts. However, his only competitive goal for the side was a memorable final minute 30-yard strike against Celtic in 2002‚Äì03, which secured a 2‚Äì1 home win against a side which reached the UEFA Cup Final that season. =England= McCann left Hearts in April 2004 in search of more regular first team football, initially signing a short-term deal with Clyde before agreeing to join Steve Evans' growing Scottish contingent at Boston United in the summer. McCann played 88 games in two seasons for the Pilgrims, scoring 1 goal against Cambridge United, before joining Notts County when his contract at York Street expired in the summer of 2006. =Return to Scotland= In February 2008, McCann signed a pre-contract deal with Scottish First Division side Dunfermline Athletic. He moved to the First Division side on the 19 May 2008. He later became their club captain. He scored his first and only goal for the club in a 1-0 win at Hibernian on 5 November 2011. He was released by the club after his contract expired at the end of the 2011/12 season. McCann signed for Ayr United during the 2012 summer transfer window. On 1 June 2013 he signed a contract with his hometown club Clydebank, where he played for two seasons before retiring from football.

It is typically sold at a low price. Cleanskin labels usually only show the grape variety and the year of bottling, as well as other information required by Australian law - alcohol content, volume, additives and standard drink information. Cleanskin wines are typically sold cheaply in dozen lots for home consumption. They may be branded wines that were originally sold at a higher price and re-labelled as cleanskins, or they may be wines produced for the purpose of being sold as cleanskins. Consequently, the quality of various batches of cleanskin wine can vary significantly. Cleanskin wine was introduced to Australia in the early 2000s as a way for the wine industry to cope with a massive oversupply of wine, and a resulting drop in prices. As a result, wine consumption in Australia has greatly increased as of 2006. Also, the price of cleanskin wine has dropped to around or below the price of beer or even bottled water. The word \\"cleanskin\\" comes from the Australian term for unbranded cattle, and is also used to refer to undercover law enforcement agents.

He played for a number of professional clubs, including Kettering Town, Leicester City, Hull City, Northampton Town, Notts County and Southend United. Dudfield made over 300 career appearances including playing in the Premier League, later becoming the most expensive player in Hull City's history in June 2001. After retiring from football in 2009 Dudfield launched Iconz Experience Ltd. a company specialising in UK Soccer Tours and EPL Soccer Clinics featuring many current and former Professional Footballers. He now spends his time between the UK and the United States.  Career  =Leicester City= Dudfield started off his career at Kettering Town where at 16 years and 2 months he became the youngest player to play in the National League in August 1996. After making 14 appearances in all competitions including 3 starts Dudfield was signed by Leicester City on his 17th birthday, spending 4 years working his way up from being the top scorer in the youth and reserve teams in the first 2 years before making his EPL debut in April 2000 at home to Everton as a replacement for Tony Cottee. He went on to make two appearances in the Premier League and was named on the substitutes bench a further 11 times in his breakthrough season. On 15 September 2000 Dudfield joined Lincoln City on a month's loan for further experience, making his Football League debut for the club in the 1‚Äì1 home draw with Blackpool the following day. Following this experience he then starred on loan for Chesterfield, scoring five goals in fourteen appearances as the club were successfully promoted as League 2 Champions. =Hull City= Chesterfield were keen to secure a permanent transfer for Dudfield following his successful loan spell however due to the reputation he was forming for himself other clubs came in for him and in June 2001 Hull City broke their transfer record to bring Dudfield to the club by signing him for over ¬£250,000. He spent two successful seasons at Hull City playing 59 times, scoring 17 goals and becoming a firm fans favourite so much so that he still regularly guests on local sports shows in the area as well as occasionally taking up co-commentary duty on Hull City's EPL and EFL games for BBC Humberside. In the 2001/2002 season Dudfield's performances earned him the annual Supporters Club Player of the Year Award. =Northampton Town= He fell out of favour with New Hull City manager Peter Taylor, who had coincidentally had sold him from Leicester City, and was sent out on loan to Northampton, who liked what they saw and signed him for a fee of ¬£25,000. He spent one season at Northampton Town playing 32 games and scoring 7 goals. He then made the move to Southend United on loan following the appointment of Colin Calderwood as the new manager. =Southend United= Dudfield hit the ground running immediately on loan with his new club scoring 5 goals in his loan spell, 3 of them match winning goals, as his goals helped fire Southend United up from the bottom of League 2 to mid table safety. Following the conclusion of his loan spell Dudfield made known his desire to stay with the club and subsequently turned down more attractive offers from clubs including Yeovil Town, Peterborough United and Luton Town in order to remain at the club. It proved to be a wise decision as during his spell at Southend United he became a firm fans favourite as the club were promoted to League 1 via a win over Lincoln City in the League 2 Play Off Final at the Millennium Stadium. Dudfield would in fact appear in 3 major finals at the Millennium Stadium (staged there as the new Wembley Stadium was being built) for Southend United during his spell at the club with Southend United also reaching consecutive LDV Finals. Following promotion to League 1 it was expected that Dudfield would remain at the club however he had a disagreement with owner Ron Martin, who he felt had reneged on his word to offer him a new improved contract, and left the club \\"out of principle\\" stating that he was a man of his word and expected the same in return. Dudfield left the club immediately after promotion despite Martin expecting him to return for pre-season and never returned to the club. =Notts County= His contract situation saw him make appearances for Boston United before Notts County signed Dudfield in the summer of 2006. He signed a two- year contract, which kept him there until the summer of 2008. During his two- year spell at the club, Dudfield relaunched his career showing his versatility by playing Centre Forward, Right Midfield and Left Wing as he played 74 games for the Magpies scoring on 17 occasions. In the 2006‚Äì2007 season Dudfield formed an impressive partnership with Jason Lee as the strikers scored 35 goals between them. His form earned him a Player of the Year nomination. In 2007-2008 Dudfield was used as the main striker for the new management team and was a mainstay of the team, often playing as a sole striker. Following the end of the season Dudfield announced he was leaving the club to seek new opportunities. =Cork City= On 25 July 2008, he signed a contract with League of Ireland side Cork City, having impressed manager Alan Mathews during a training period at the club. Dudfield scored several important goals for the club in the last couple of months of the 2008 season, and featured in the UEFA Cup and Setanta Sports Cup final, in which they beat Glentoran 2‚Äì1 to win the competition for the first time. Dudfield then decided to return home, turning down the offer of a new two-year deal, in order to retire from football due to the troublesome knee injury that had continued to take its toll.  Management  =Quorn= In September 2011, Dudfield was appointed as first team manager at semi-pro Quorn of the Evo-Stik League, who under their previous manager had lost the first 9 games of the season. He held the position for several months taking the club off the bottom of the League, including wins against eventual champions Ilkeston FC, before leaving a month before the end of the 2011/12 season. Quorn FC remains Dudfield only coaching role to date despite being linked with a number of coaching roles at professional clubs, most notably Notts County.  Career after Football  =Iconz Experience Ltd.= Upon his retirement from full-time professional football in 2009, Dudfield began employment at Nottingham Forest and worked in various roles through to his departure in May 2015. In early 2015 Dudfield launched his own company, Iconz Experience Ltd. focussing on UK Soccer Tour's as well as hosting 'EPL Soccer Clinics' abroad. Specialising in using former Premier League footballers as the main attraction, Iconz Experience Ltd. exhibited at the 2013 Soccerex festival in Rio de Janeiro with a host of international household names including Ruud Gullit, Aron Winter and Gaizka Mendieta. On 1 June 2015, Iconz Experience signed an official partnership agreement with Nottingham Forest to exclusively host all 'Nottingham Forest UK Soccer Tours' from countries such as the U.S, Australia and various other countries. Since 2015, former Manchester United and England Striker Alan Smith has been the official ambassador for Iconz Experience Ltd. and coaches including former Leicester City EPL boss Micky Adams have been linked with hands on roles at the company.

It is located near the Western Australian Museum and State Library of Western Australia and is supported and managed by the Department of Local Government, Sport and Cultural Industries of the Government of Western Australia. The current gallery main building opened in 1979. It is linked to the old court house ‚Äì The Centenary Galleries ‚Äî which house the historical collection. History The Art Gallery was originally housed in the Jubilee Building with the State Museum and Library. The Jubilee Building, which was intended to be a public library only, was to be opened in honour of Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee in 1887, but instead, only the first stone for the foundation was laid. The foundation stone was laid for the Art Gallery in July 1901 by the Duke of Cornwall and York, shortly after the federation of Australia. Several notable individuals were involved with the development of the Jubilee Building and Art Gallery, including John Winthrop Hackett, James Battye, Ludwig Glauert, George Pitt Morison and George Temple-Poole. Sir James Dromgole Linton recommended purchases for the State Art Collection. Centenary Gallery building, formerly the Police Courts, is linked to the main gallery. The Art Gallery Administration Building is housed in the former Police Quarters, designed by architect Hillson Beasley, who also designed Government House. It was built during the economic boom created by the 1890s Kalgoorlie gold rush. The Administration Building moved into the Police Quarters in the 1970s during the nickel mining boom. The Main Gallery Building was built in 1977, and was also spurred by the mining boom. Western Australia was also placing more importance on cultural institutions, and the government was inspired by the upcoming 150th anniversary of federation in 1979. Construction of the Alexander Library began in the same period. The architect of the main gallery building was Charles Sierakowski from the Public Works Department, who worked with engineer Philip Nadebaum and architectural company, Summerhayes and Associates. It was designed in the Bauhaus method with a Brutalist exterior, which was popular in European design. The slab and shear head column system was an innovative architectural feature in Western Australia at the time. In 2017 AGWA announced plans to redevelop its sizable rooftop as focus for sculpture, events, restaurants, film etc in a project called AGWA Elevate‚Äù targeted for opening before the Gallery‚Äôs anniversary in 2020. The Government of Western Australia has pledged $10m towards this project. ‚ÄòSix Seasons‚Äù a high profile project to increase the focus on AGWA‚Äôs Indigenous collection was launched in 2017, and a new dedicated permanent Indigenous gallery was inaugurated alongside ‚ÄúPlain Speak‚Äù a special exhibit for the Perth International Arts Festival.

The village Dundonald Castle from the Old Bank woods The village is mostly known for Dundonald Castle, which was built in the 14th century by King Robert II, on the ruins of a castle built earlier (in 1260) by his grandfather, Alexander Comyn. It served the Scottish kings for 150 years. The ruins of Old Auchans Castle lies nearby, the previous residence of Susanna Montgomery, Lady Eglinton. In Dundonald Woods near the old Hallyards Farm are the ruins of Kemp Law Dun, an Iron Age vitrified hillfort, close to the site of St Mary's Chapel. Since 1945, it serves mostly as a dormitory town for the larger towns in the area. Tens of thousands of years ago Dundonald did have a beach at one point. The parish church The present church (NS 366 343) was built in 1803, however the first recorded church was present in 1229 when it was gifted to the convent at Damilling and later to Paisley Abbey, with whom it stayed until the Reformation.Campbell, Page 175 ;Views in and around Dundonald File:The Auchans Burial Ground, Dundonald.JPGThe Auchans Burial Ground, Dundonald Parish Church File:James Dunlop's memorial, Dundonald.JPGMemorial to John Dunlop Esq., who lived to over ninety years of age; onetime Factor at Auchans Castle.

The house was built for the Earl of Eglinton's commissioner Monteaulieu Burgess of Coilsfield, followed in 1885 by the Hon. Greville Richard Vernon, son of the 1st Lord Lyveden. Major Coats of the Paisley thread manufacturers tenanted the house at one time, as did the Beattie banking family.Stewart, Page 11 In 1947 the Earl of Eglinton sold the house to the Earl of Dundonald.Close (2005), Page 22 The house was then sold by the Earl of Dundonald in 1960 to a builder and finally demolished in 1970 and the site has since been developed as a housing estate on the edge of the town.Love (2005), Page 23Love (2003), Page 226  Natural history  Aught Woods and Collennan Reservoir. Dundonald Woods (NS363343) are one of the most extensive areas of elm-dominated woodlands in Ayrshire. Ash, oak and sycamore are also abundant; much of the policies are composed of derelict-coppiced-type growth from trees felled in the Second World War. Some conifer plantations are present. Wetland habitats are also present, including the Collennan Reservoir, springs and a eutrophic loch, contributing to the high biodiversity of the site. Dog's Mercury, Wood Melick, Broad-leaved Helleborine, and Giant Bellflower are amongst the significant plants present.Edwards, Site 22 The site of Galrigs Loch with Dundonald in the background. The small loch of Galrigs was located near Laurieston Farm and the ruin of Lochside Farm; it is now evident as a marshy area dominated by rushes. Galrigs was the old name for the lands of Newfield. Sport =Troon Dundonald A.F.C.= The prominent sports team in the village is Troon Dundonald A.F.C. The club was formed in 1983 by 3 'ageing' players, at which time they were named Troon Burns A.F.C., and have now surpassed their 30th season in the Ayrshire Amateur Football Association. During this time they have had a few name changes, sometimes due to sponsorship commitments, but in 1998/99 season, they settled on Troon Amateurs Football Club. The club President, Stuart Urquhart, still remains from the original founders of the club and he is as passionate as ever about everything that goes on within the club, as well as with Amateur football in general. In the years since their formation, they have enjoyed 3 promotions in back to back seasons, 1983/84 through 1985/86, which saw them go from the 4th Division to the 1st of Ayrshire's Amateur Leagues, which is one of the largest & toughest amateur leagues in Scotland. In recent years, the club have developed to add youth teams below the amateur structure. =Dundonald Highland Games= The main sports event in Dundonald is the annual \\"Dundonald Highland Games\\" which brings the whole village together for the weekend in sport. The Slough of Despond The old limekiln The Slough Burn in the Slough of Despond. On the boundary of Dundonald and Symington parishes lies an area known as the 'Slough of Despond'. The original Slough of Despond is a deep bog in John Bunyan's allegory The Pilgrim's Progress into which the character Christian sinks under the weight of his sins and his sense of guilt for them. The burn in this area, rising near the old Broadhirst Farm, has long been known as the Slough, the Scots equivalent spelling is Sleugh, meaning a marsh or quagmire. It is not known how the name 'Slough of Despond' was added to the area, however it is recorded since the mid 19th century and may be linked to the nearby limekilns that were generally notorious for the acrid 'hell-like' smoke that issued from them. The Slough Burn still rises from the marshy area below the Broadhirst Woods, however the limestone quarry that served the limekilns is now abandoned, surviving as an area rich in wildlife, containing old woodland indicator plants such as Wood Anemone (Anemone nemorosa), Bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), Wood Sorrel (Oxalis acetosella), Dog's Mercury (Mercurialis perennis), Herb Robert (Geranium robertianum) and other species. The Slough Burn runs down past Dankeith House, Templeton and Fortacres, Todrigs and through Caprington, to join the River Irvine near Gatehead.

Career Lavety started his career with local heroes St Mirren in season 1991‚Äì92. In the following season he really began to catch the eye, as he scored 20 goals as St Mirren narrowly missed out on a return to the Scottish Premier Division. Lavety failed a drugs test for the recreational drug ecstasy in 1995. Lavety moved to Hibernian for a transfer fee of ¬£200,000. He scored on his debut in a 2‚Äì0 win against Brechin City in August, but injury problems dogged him and he only managed eight games in his first season at Hibs. His absence did not help a team who narrowly avoided relegation thanks to a play-off victory against Airdrieonians. Altogether he made 43 starts for Hibernian, with a further 23 sub appearances. He scored 12 goals and was top scorer with 9 goals the year Hibs were relegated to the First Division. He made his final appearance as a substitute against Falkirk on the day Hibs were presented with the First Division title, in May 1999. Lavety moved back to St Mirren on loan, scoring 15 goals in their 1999‚Äì00 title-winning season before he was bedeviled by injury problems. Lavety was part of TeamBath, the team who became the first university side to qualify for the FA Cup proper for 122 years. He also had spells with Clydebank, Pollok, KR Reykjavik of Iceland and with Des Moines Menace in America before his return to St Mirren. He had been on trial at Love Street in the summer of 2003, and scored against Gretna before signing for two years on a part-time deal. When Gus MacPherson took over the managers job he appeared looking fitter and the magic moment finally came against Airdrie United in the Scottish Cup, when he hit a low 25-yard shot past the Airdrie goalkeeper for his only goal of the season so far. That goal took him past former Saint Mark Yardley in the post-war scorer's chart, but it was his last in Saints colours. His final game came against Ayr United towards the end of the season, and Lavety helped the side overcome a 0‚Äì1 deficit, which was turned into a 4‚Äì1 victory. Lavety left in the summer of 2004 and signed for junior side Neilston, playing alongside fellow ex-Saints James McGuire and Chris Kerr, but left them the following summer. Lavety returned to action for St Mirren in the Selco Masters tournament on 12 June 2011.

He was born in Souvret, Belgium (Courcelles) and died in Montigny-le-Tilleul. He shot his films with very small budgets (‚Ç¨2000 to 2500 per film) and used unknown or non-professional actors. He called himself the director of the absurd and always fiercely protected his anonymity by masking his face during his public appearances. He shot over 50 films making him one of Belgium's most prolific film directors. His life was supposed to be the subject of a Yann Moix film, called Palme d'or, starring Beno√Æt Poelvoorde. The project was not filmed. Moix did make, without Poelvoorde, the disastrous '. Fr√©d√©ric Sojcher's film ', also known as Born to Film, was selected and shown at the Cannes Film Festival in 2004, is dedicated to Rousseau's work as well as Max Naveaux's and Jacques Hardy's. It stars the actors Bouli Lanners and Beno√Æt Poelvoorde. Rousseau's first few films were fairly conventional examples of the fantasy genre. However, some of them won regional awards in the 1970s (people's choice, best screenplay). A semi-permanent lack of financial resources prevented him from making technically accomplished films. However, he financed, edited, directed and acted in most of them. He was also known for carrying a gun on set and sometimes firing it to get the actors' attention. Having a fertile imagination fueled by esoteric tastes in books, his films shunned the mainstream more and more, thus becoming marginalized. He never received subsidies to finance his films. Patrick Moriau, a Belgian politician, stated once that \\"If one asked me to allocate part of the Walloon Community's finances to the Committee for Film Selection, the money would undoubtedly never go into Rousseau's pockets. He may be a kind man, but his films are frankly wild and scare people.\\" On the evening of July 15, 2014 after an altercation outside a caf√© between two men, he was run over by a car driven by one of the men and remained in a coma until his death later that year on November 5.

In 1909, the two men published their first novel, Le Rour. Investigating Magistrate Germain Fuselier, later to become a recurring character in the Fant√¥mas series, appears in the novel. Then, in February 1911, Allain and Souvestre embarked upon the Fant√¥mas book series at the request of publisher Arth√®me Fayard, who wanted to create a new monthly pulp magazine. The success was immediate and lasting. After Souvestre‚Äôs death in February 1914, Allain continued the Fant√¥mas saga alone, then launched several other series, such as Tigris, Fatala, Miss T√©ria and F√©rocias, but none garnered the same popularity as Fant√¥mas.

Hence, the name of the town was changed to Ahmedgarh in honour of Nawab Ahmed Ali Khan.  Geography  The city lies about 18 km north of Malerkotla on the Sangrur-Ludhiana road.

Design  Ahmedgarh is an example of pre- independence town planning. It was planned as a market town on the model of Lyallpur (Faisalabad) in Pakistan. The planning consisted of a cross-axis of two main avenues along which auctioning, vending and storage of agricultural and agriculture-related goods took place. The four quadrants thus constituted the residential quarters for the people. The town was enclosed by a fasil, a brick arched wall with only four manned entry points for security. Further, each of the four mohallas could be accessed via one of the two gated structures from the main avenues. At the intersection of the two avenues is a public well. The intersection is now known as the Gandhi chowk. The plots abutting the market avenues were 16 feet wide and ranged from 150 to 240 feet in length. Each plot was constructed with a facade featuring three Mughal arches, forming a colonnade on both sides of the avenues. Sardar Bahadur Singh Dhaliwal's descendants reside in Ahmedgharh. At a later stage, the avenues were split in two, with shops along the median, hence forming the 8 streets intersecting at Gandhi Chowk. The wide avenues have been encroached upon from both sides, and only a few buildings retain the arched facade, often found behind several rooms from the entrance to the building.  Economy  Ahmedgarh is the only city in India that manufactures trowels and harrow for cultivation and then transports it to other states and places. Ahmedgarh is an important agricultural market. The main crops brought to this market are paddy, wheat and cotton. Close to two industrial towns of Malerkotla and Ludhiana, a number of small-scale industries operate in and around this town. The city is also famous for agricultural implements such as diggers, plows, and sickles. Ahmedgarh became one of India's dry ports. Demographics India census, Ahmedgarh had a population of 28,007.

It is dedicated to Saint Matthew, whose relics are inside the crypt. The Cathedral was built when the city was the capital of the Principality of Salerno. History Begun by Robert Guiscard in 1076 in the episcopate of Alfano I, the Duomo was consecrated by Pope Gregory VII in 1084. In 1688, the architect Ferdinando Sanfelice remodelled the interior of the Duomo in the Neapolitan Baroque and Rococo styles. A restoration in the 1930s brought it back to an appearance similar to the original one. The Duomo is a symbol of the Italian Renaissance because inside is the tomb of Pope Gregory VII who rejected imperial domination of the church. The Duomo was damaged in World War II when, as part of the Operation Avalanche, the Allies landed in Salerno in September 1943. Architectural features One of the pulpits. The most striking external feature is the bell tower (mid-12th century), with small arcades and mullioned windows, standing 56 m high and in Arabic-Norman style. It contains 8 large bells. The fa√ßade has a Romanesque portal with Byzantine-style bronze doors from Constantinople (1099), with 56 panels with figures, crosses and stories from Jesus's life. The entrance has a portico with 28 antique columns whose pointed arches, with lava rock intarsia, show influence of Arab art, and contains a series of ancient Roman sarcophagi. The interior has a nave and two aisles, divided by pilasters in which the original columns are embedded, and three apses. Artworks include two pulpits with mosaic decorations, paintings by Francesco Solimena, a 14th-century Gothic statue of Madonna with Child and the sepulchres of the Neapolitan queen Margaret of Durazzo, of Roger Borsa and of archbishop Bartolomeo d'Arpano, and the tomb of Pope Gregory VII. The Crypt The crypt, believed to house the remains of Matthew the Apostle, is a groin vaulted hall with a basilica-like plan divided by columns.

Overview  Knowledge environments departing from constructivist epistemology assume that domain knowledge is built in and results from cognitive and/or social practices. From this perspective the primary purpose of knowledge environments is to host and support activities of knowledge building, the means including cognitive ergonomics, social software, immediate information access exploiting means of multimedia and hypertext, content contribution functionalities and structured ontologies. Wikipedia itself is a prototypical example of a knowledge environment in this sense. From another perspective, the purpose of a knowledge environment can be defined as a method to facilitate consistent knowledge outcomes. Knowledge outcomes reveal themselves as learning, communication, goals, decisions, etc. Consistent knowledge outcomes imply predictable learning results or replicable communication results and predictable quality of decisions. The design of knowledge environments is both commonplace activity and specialised expert work. At a simplistic level every teacher, every author, every librarian and every database manager is a creator of a knowledge environment. At a specialized level, knowledge environments need sophisticated architecture and modeling capabilities. This approach is necessary when the creator of the knowledge environment wants to deliver replicable results in hundreds of specific instances of the same knowledge environment. On the other hand, the strengthening trend of public authorship leads to open-ended ontologies by means of, say, tagging or folksonomies. In a significant sense, knowledge environments are in such cases created not only by their authors or owners but also by the contributors of their ontologies. Types There are various kinds of knowledge environments: * Socio-technological environments, e.g. Virtual Learning Environments, of which the goal is collaborative knowledge building * Learning environments where the main goal of the participants is to gain some kind of knowledge, skill, or conceptual clarity * Virtual environments incorporating communities of participation in, e.g., political processes * Creative or experimental environments in which knowledge is constructed by means of collaborative authoring of text, but even non-verbal, e.g. audiovisual content * Online simulations of ecology, economy, or society * Knowledge-intensive gaming environments * Communication environments where the main goal of the participants is to transmit to each other some signals or information related to the activities and behavior being generated in that environment * Decisional environments where the main goal of the participants is to share knowledge and opinions such that decision options are generated and choices made * Operating environments where the knowledge environment is a support or enabler for the actual process or physical work being carried out  Issues of development =Variables= Knowledge environments are all pervasive but difficult to build on a scalable and a replicable basis. This is because of two groups of interacting variables: * Variables associated with diversity of context * Variables associated with the consequent multiplicity of perspectives to the domains in question * Variables associated with complexity of domain =Issues= Some of the issues in development are: * How to create a knowledge environment that acknowledges the diversity in participants, and the consequent multiplicity of perspectives to given domain of information * How to facilitate exploration of multiple perspectives to domains of information * How to optimize cognitive economics * How to measure effectiveness of a knowledge environment * How to integrate multiple media * How to give users of such environments freedom to discover knowledge in such an environment while placing them within an operating structure  Applications Knowledge environments are useful for designing: * Learning * Knowledge management * Scenario planning in companies * Decision gaining tools * Simulations * Games * Surrounding External links * Workshops on Knowledge environment for science and engineering * Environment ","title":"Knowledge environment"},{"id":"5702465","text":"Akkarampalle is a census town in Chittoor district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.

His followers were later labelled \\"Bonosians\\" and considered heretical.CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Bonosus History Bonosus taught that Mary had several other children after Jesus, which was counter to the prevalent teaching of the Great Church in the 4th Century. The Council of Capua in 391, before which the matter was brought, did not pass any judgment on it, but referred it to the Metropolitan Anysius of Thessalonica and the other bishops of Illyria. They condemned Bonosus and tried to exclude him from his church. In a letter to the same bishops Pope Siricius approves the sentence and also condemns the opinion that Mary did not always preserve her virginity. Notwithstanding his condemnation, and the prudent advice of his study friend St. Ambrose to submit, Bonosus continued to exercise the episcopal functions, to consecrate bishops and ordain priests. According to two letters of Pope Innocent I, one to Martian of Na√Øssa in 409 and the other to the bishops of Macedonia in 414, those ordained by Bonosus before his condemnation were to be received in the Church without a new ordination, those ordained since Bonosus's condemnation, especially if they had themselves sought to be ordained by him, were to be deprived of their dignity. As Innocent speaks of Bonosus as no longer living, we may infer that he died at the end of the fourth, or the beginning of the fifth century. The baptism conferred by his followers, the Bonosians, was by some declared valid and by others invalid. Whether, besides denying Mary's perpetual virginity, Bonosus also denied Christ's divinity cannot be determined with certainty, but it is certain that the Bonosians, to whom we find references in the councils and in ecclesiastical writers up to the seventh century, denied this dogma. On this point they were at one with the Photinians. As a consequence, they affirmed the purely adoptive divine filiation of Christ. However, they differed from the Adoptionists in rejecting all natural sonship, whereas the Adoptionists, distinguishing in Christ the God and the man, attributed to the former a natural, and to the latter an adoptive sonship.

In the provinces of Anhui, Fujian, Gansu, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Liaoning, Nei Mongol, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Shandong, Shanxi, Sichuan, Xizang, Yunnan, and Zhejiang, and also to Taiwan and Korea. It grows close to sea level in the north of its range, and at altitudes of up to 2,800 m in the south of the range. The species prefers full sun and acidic, loamy soil, and has a medium growth rate.Flora of Taiwan: Castanea mollissima  Ecology  When cultivated close to other species of chestnut (including Japanese chestnut, C. crenata; American chestnut, C. dentata; and sweet chestnut, C. sativa), Chinese chestnut readily cross-pollinates with them to form hybrids.Sisco, P. H., et al. 2005 An Improved Genetic Map for Castanea mollissima/Castanea dentata and its Relationship to the Genetic Map of Castanea sativa. Acta Hort. 693. Abstract. Chinese chestnuts have evolved over a long period of time in coexistence with the bark fungal disease chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica, formerly Endothia parasitica), and have evolved a very successful resistance to the blight, probably more so than any other species of chestnut, so that, although it is not immune, it typically sustains no more than minor damage when infected. It's important to realize, though, that Chinese chestnut trees vary considerably in blight resistance. Some individuals are quite susceptible while others are essentially immune to the disease.Dr. Greg Miller, Empire Chestnut Company, FAQ http://www.empirechestnut.com/faqpests.htm Retrieved January 13, 2016 Japanese chestnut is also comparatively resistant to blight, with European chestnut somewhat less so. In the 1890s, Chinese and Japanese chestnuts were imported to the United States with the intention of utilizing them as orchard trees due to their small, compact size compared to the towering American chestnut. The results unfortunately were disastrous as the imported Asian species introduced blight to which C. dentata lacked any resistance. The disease was first noticed on a tree in the Brooklyn Zoo in 1904 and quickly spread all out of control, ravaging American chestnuts. Within 30 years, there were very few left in their native range. An active program has been pursued in North America to cross-breed the Chinese and American chestnuts to try to maximize various desirable traits of the American chestnut, such as larger stature, larger leaf size, larger nut size, and greater nut sweetness, while also isolating and carrying the blight resistance from the Chinese chestnut.FAO: Chestnut blight  Uses  The nuts are edible, and the tree is widely cultivated in eastern Asia; over 300 cultivars have been selected for nut production, subdivided into five major regional groups: Northern, Yangtze River Valley, Sichuan and Guizhou, Southern, and Southwestern. Besides that, the Dandong chestnut (belonging to the Japanese chestnut ‚Äì Castanea crenata) is a major cultivar in Liaoning Province.Economic forest trees . Some cultivars, such as 'Kuling', 'Meiling', and 'Nanking', have large nuts up to 4 cm diameter. The nuts are sweet, and considered by some to have the best taste of any chestnut,Biodiversity of China: Economic forest trees though others state they are not as good as the American chestnut.Castanea mollissima: Chinese chestnut.

However, Gibraltar experienced restrictions after that date causing problems with its telecommunications system, as a direct result of the Spanish sovereignty claim. Until 10 February 2007, Spain continued to impose restrictions on Gibraltar's ability to expand and modernise its telecommunications infrastructure. These included a refusal to recognise Gibraltar's International Direct Dialling (IDD) code (+350) which restricted the expansion of the Gibraltar telephone numbering plan, and the prevention of roaming arrangements for Gibraltar GSM mobile phones in Spain and vice versa. Following the signing of the C√≥rdoba Accord between the Governments of Gibraltar, the United Kingdom and Spain in September 2006, these restrictions were removed with effect from 10 February 2007.  History of the dispute  = International calls to Gibraltar = With the introduction of International Direct Dialling in the 1970s, Gibraltar was allocated its own IDD code, +350, by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), which was accessible from any telephone network outside Spain. However, although physical connectivity existed between Gibraltar and Spain, the Spanish government prohibited its national operators from recognising this code. When direct dialling from Spain was introduced, Gibraltar was treated as part of the Spanish telephone numbering plan, with callers from Spain having to dial 956 (the area code for the adjacent province of C√°diz) followed by the digit 7, and the subscriber's five digit landline number in Gibraltar, which could only begin with the digits 4, 5 or 7. Consequently, only 30,000 numbers available in Gibraltar could be dialled directly from Spain. With a population of approximately 28,000,CIA World Factbook: Gibraltar this caused a shortage of new numbers that could be allocated to new telecom operators, thereby preventing deregulation of the industry as required by the European Union.Position of the government of Gibraltar , 1998 This also affected international calls from the rest of the world, because carriers using least- cost routing, especially in the United States, routed calls to Gibraltar via Spain, which prevented calls dialled using the +350 code from terminating in Gibraltar. Consequently, the caller would hear a recorded announcement saying that the number dialled did not exist. Even when calls routed via Spain were allowed to terminate in Gibraltar, under the 'sender keeps all' arrangement, Telef√≥nica in Spain was able to keep revenue from these calls, instead of paying Gibtelecom's international termination charges. Although all other countries and territories recognised the +350 dialling code, not all networks blocked calls to Gibraltar from being made using Spain's +34 9567 code, which allowed subscribers to call Gibraltar for the cost of a call to Spain. Owing to the demand for mobile phones, Gibraltar introduced new number ranges consisting of eight digits, but these could not be dialled directly from Spain. For example, Gibtelecom's pre-paid services consisted of eight digit numbers with the prefix 540, but when using the 9567 prefix from Spain, the last three digits were not recognised, and callers were required to re-enter the eight digit number, during which time they were being charged. However, if the number were dialled from the rest of the world using the +350 code, the call would be terminated in Gibraltar without any problem. On 16 November 2001, Spain offered to allocate 70,000 numbers to Gibraltar. However, Gibraltar refused the offer, citing that it would mean giving Spain control of its numbering policy.The Government of Gibraltar Press Release on 23 January 2002 = GSM roaming = Gibraltar's only GSM operator, Gibtelecom, was prevented from establishing roaming agreements with Spanish operators. As a consequence, once Gibtel GSM customers crossed into Spain and moved outside the area of coverage of their own base stations, they were unable to use their phones until they entered another Member State of the European UnionQuestion to the EU Commission, 2000 or were within range of base stations in Morocco. = Resolution = Under the September 2006 accord in C√≥rdoba between Gibraltar, Spain and the UK, a timetable was agreed to remove these restrictions. Spain recognised Gibraltar's international dialling code, thereby allowing Gibraltar to expand its telephone numbering plan, and allow Spanish mobile phone operators to enter into roaming arrangements with Gibtelecom. These measures came into force on 10 February 2007.International Dialing codes implemented Following the removal of Spanish restrictions in 2007, all mobile telephone numbers in Gibraltar can be dialled in full from Spain, using the +350 international code. The Spanish numbering space allocated to Gibraltar has now been withdrawn from use, and will now only be used for numbers in Spain.

Krapanj is one of the smallest inhabited islands of the Adriatic Sea covering 0.36 km¬≤. It is also the most densely inhabited island and has the lowest elevation (1.5 m above sea level). Krapanj is 300 m offshore at its closest point from the mainland village of Brodarica.  Geography  The average elevation is about and the highest point is above sea level. It lies in the Dinaric direction, from north-west to south-east. =Geology= Krapanj is composed of Mesozoic limestone and dolomite. =Climate= The island of Krapanj is situated in the central part of the Croatian littoral and is characterised by a warm, dry Mediterranean climate. According to data from the nearest weather station, in ≈†ibenik, for the period from 1986 to 1996 the average annual temperature was and the average annual precipitation .  History  Krapanj Many of the Adriatic Islands were populated in pre-history by the Illyrians. Krapanj however was first populated by Croatian Toma Juriƒá, a nobleman from ≈†ibenik and a descendant of the ≈†ubiƒá family from Bribir. Juriƒá purchased the island in 1436 from the ≈†ibenik County with the intention of building a Franciscan church on the uninhabited island. Realising their father's dream after his death, Juriƒá's 4 sons completed The Holy Cross Church and monastery in 1523 with blessings from Pope Eugene IV on one condition: only the Friars were to live and inhabit Krapanj. Krapanj came under the possession of the Franciscan Province of St. Jerome of Dalmatia in the 16th century as the Ottoman Empire invaded neighbouring lands. The Franciscans allowed people living on the neighbouring mainland to build their own settlement, southeast of the monastery who then united to defend themselves against the Ottomans. Since the work of the Franciscan friars was closely connected to the inhabitants of the island, in 1652, the monastery was given a parish and the friars began offering spiritual and other assistance to parishes on the mainland. The remains of the old church walls, in part, can be seen by the front door of the cloister. The church was expanded in 1937, and the wall bearing the consecration date (May 15, 1523) joins the new church building with the cloister. Krapanj was the most densely populated of all Croatian Islands given a lucrative economy. But from the middle to late 20th century, many inhabitants fled communism and poverty by emigrating to Australia, Canada and the United States. Adding to the trend of depopulation, the population decreased from 1,767 in 1981 to only 170 in 2011.  Art and culture  The island of Krapanj's culture and traditions reflect the Dalmatian way of life. Hard work, good food and a healthy lifestyle embodies the seaside rock houses and tiny side-streets. Krapanj takes pride in its origins of deep sea diving and generally personifies a seafaring culture. Krapanj's tourist industry is vastly underdeveloped, with the main factor being the prohibition of vehicles on the island. As a result, the island has kept many of the old-world traditions that add a unique charm. The art of producing wine (vino), olive oil (maslinovo ulje), rakija and sea sponge (spu≈æve) are traditions that date back to pre-history but are still extremely evident in modern-day Krapanj. Food is generally seafood, caught by local fisherman and distributed locally. Krapanj holds a host of cultural antiquities in the monastery including \\"The Last Supper\\" by the 16th-century Italian artist Francesco da Santa Croce and a Renaissance painting titled \\"The Black Madonna On The Throne\\". The biggest event on the island's calendar is the annual Krapljanska Fe≈°ta. The day-long festival is held on 2 August and celebrates Gospe od Anƒëela (\\"Our Lady of the Angels\\"). Thousands of people gather on the island for the cultural feast of good food, good wine and centuries of culture. The locals annually proclaim \\"a night the island almost sank\\". =Cuisine= Krapanj's island culture has spread throughout the region as many inhabitants now live in mainland Brodarica. Traditionally fish, clams and octopus are either grilled over dried vine leaves or cooked in a wood- fired oven. The signature dishes of the region are Squid Ink Risotto, Octopus Potato Salad and Grilled Fish. Economy =Deep sea diving= Sea sponge from Krapanj Krapanj has a rich history in deep sea diving, primarily in the harvesting and selling of sea sponges. Antun from Crete introduced Krapanj's inhabitants to diving and sea sponge gathering/processing over 300 years ago. For many years, diving for sponges had been the major income for Krapanj families, earning them the title of \\"Spu≈ævari\\" (sponge vendors). By the middle of the 20th century the industry peaked with the inception of breathing apparatus and motorised boats. Crews would generally dive 6 times a day, over 20 days taking turns one at a time at depths of over . It was a dangerous occupation as just the weight of the suit was and the constant danger of decompression sickness discouraged generations to come. The small industry still persists, with sponges from Krapanj sold throughout Europe with a primary market in Greece and Italy. The cosmetic market has in recent years opened the market for Krapanj sponges on an international scale. The tradition of diving has in latter days given rise to scuba diving, free diving and spearfishing professionals from Krapanj. The Krapanj monastery museum permanently exhibits a show on sea sponge diving. =Tourism= Krapanj is not on the tourist map. Since the end of the Croatian War of Independence, the island has begun a slow rebuild. Many of its old terraces have either been restored or are in the process of rebuild under strict heritage by-laws. This has started a steady stream of tourists to the island which now supports a certain level of tourism infrastructure. Many other Adriatic Islands have constructed bridges to allow tourist access by car. Krapanj has made the decision not to connect to the mainland as this would destroy the island's heritage. Demographics The island has only one settlement; Krapanj, which, apart from the island itself, consists of islets of Mumonja, Oblik, Krbela mala, Krbela vela and the O≈°trica peninsula, located to the south. Krapanj is administratively located in the City of ≈†ibenik and is one of its local committees. According to the 2011 census, Krapanj had a population of 170.

Biography Jon Hul (Born May 30, 1957) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and later grew up in [California] and [Nevada]. In 1971, he attended Orr Middle School in [Las Vegas Valley / Las Vegas, NV] until 1973. In 1974, he attended Valley High School (Las Vegas, Nevada)Valley High School] where he studied ceramics, oil painting, watercolors, and commercial design, graduating in 1976. After graduating from Valley High School in 1976, he decided to pursue music (playing drums for hand full of years), travels the world, but maintained his desire to become a successful artist, thus turning his God given art talents into being a fine art artist, full-time. With limited education in the arts (junior high school and high school, without college education) Jon (subsequently) continued experimenting with different art materials thus expanding his use of creativity by using different art materials (different from that of his early school years) making it prevalent for him to create his artworks (rendered from past to present) and selling them, successfully. Therefore, he is not a college graduate, and is mainly self-taught at his craft. He has noted as early influences the artists Salvador Dal√≠, Frank Frazetta, Alberto Vargas, M. C. Escher, Pablo Picasso, and later Patrick Nagel, Olivia De Berardinis and Hajime Sorayama (later). In 1987 he decided to become a full-time artist, and to focus on fatherhood. Many of his art pieces were rendered on different substrates, as he uses the media of watercolor, acrylic paint, oil paints, and pencil. To date, Jon Hul has rendered art of the most gorgeous women in the world, such as the following models are: Shae Marks, Suzi Simpson, Lisa Boyle, Barbara Moore, Angela Melini, Tylyn John, Sandra Taylor, Destiny Davis, Kay O'Hara, Jade Reiger, Leslie Sanchez, Devin DeVasquez, Brandy Lee, Madeline Ghenea, and many more.

In 1678, on the outbreak of the fabricated Popish Plot, he was falsely accused of treason by Titus Oates, who had gained the backing of Thomas Osborne, 1st Earl of Danby, the effective head of the English government. Oates accused Wakeman of conspiring to kill the King with the help of the Jesuits, and to put his brother James, Duke of York on the throne in his place. At his trial in 1679 Wakeman was acquitted, the first sign that the public was beginning to lose faith in the reality of the Plot. Life He was the son of Edward Wakeman (1592‚Äì1659) of the Inner Temple, by Mary (d. 1676), daughter of Richard Cotton of Warblington, Sussex. George Wakeman was raised as a Roman Catholic, and was educated abroad, probably in Paris, where he possibly graduated in medicine. Like his elder brother Richard (d. 1662), who raised a troop of horse for the king, he was a staunch royalist. On his return to England he became involved in a plot against Oliver Cromwell, and was imprisoned until the eve of the Restoration. His record of loyalty to the Stuart dynasty was to be a crucial factor in his acquittal on charges of treason in 1679: although Charles II's gratitude to his subjects for their past services could not always be relied on, in the crisis of 1678-9 he repaid Wakeman's loyalty in full. Also, once the initial hysteria caused by the Plot died down, it became clear to most rational people that Wakeman's record of unblemished loyalty to the Crown was utterly inconsistent with the charges of treason made against him. John Evelyn, a personal friend of his, was no doubt one of many who accepted that there was a Plot of some sort but refused to believe that Wakeman, \\"so worthy a gentleman\\", had any part in it.Fraser, Antonia King Charles II Mandarin edition 1993 p.357 On 13 February 1661, as Sir George Wakeman of Beckford, he was created a baronet by Charles II, though it seems that the patent was never sealed. In August 1668 he was attending the rising statesman Sir Joseph Williamson, later Secretary of State; his appointment some two years later as physician in ordinary to Queen Catherine of Braganza is attributed to his high reputation for a Roman Catholic physician in England. =Popish Plot= In their perjured narrative of the Popish Plot, Titus Oates and Israel Tonge declared that Wakeman had been offered ¬£10,000 to poison Charles II's posset, and that he could easily effect this through the agency of the Queen. The story went that Wakeman refused the task, and held out until ¬£15,000 was offered him. Then, they said, he attended the \\"Jesuit Consult\\" on 30 August 1678, received a large sum of money on account, and, the further reward of a post as physician-general in the army having been promised him, he definitely engaged to poison the king. At his first appearance before the King and his Privy Council, Wakeman defended himself with such vigour, pointing to his lifetime of loyal service to the Stuart monarchy, that the Council, somewhat taken aback, did not order his arrest. Kenyon, J.P The Popish Plot Phoenix Press reissue 2000 p.83 Wakeman was indicted for high treason at the Old Bailey on 18 July 1679, together with three priests, the case being tried by Lord Chief Justice William Scroggs, assisted by his fellow Chief Justice Francis North, 1st Baron Guilford and the junior King's Bench judges. Scroggs, formerly a strong believer in the Popish Plot, was on this occasion, for reasons which have never been entirely clear, firmly on the side of the accused. Kenyon 2000 pp.192-201The chief witnesses for the prosecution were William Bedloe and Oates, who swore that he had seen the paper appointing Wakeman to the post of physician-general. It was elicited from Oates in the course of the proceedings that he was incapable at the time alluded to of identifying either Wakeman's person or his handwriting. Wakeman and his co- accused all defended themselves with great vigour (in a case of treason the accused was not entitled to counsel until the passage of the Treason Act 1695), and their witnesses received a far more courteous hearing than defence witnesses in previous trials had. In particular Ellen Rigby, the housekeeper to the Benedictine order in London, was listened to with a respect not often accorded to a Catholic woman in that age. Scroggs in his summing up commented severely upon the character of the evidence, stressed his reluctance to shed innocent blood, (a reluctance which had certainly not been evident on his part in previous Plot trials), and warned the jury that while he still believed in the Plot, it must not be assumed that all those accused were party to it.Kenyon 2000 p.200 The jury, after asking if they might find the prisonersThe other defendants were William Cuthbert Wall alias William Marshall (Marshal, Marsh), William Rumley or Rumney and James Corker; . guilty of misprision of treason, and being told they could not, found all the prisoners not guilty. The acquittal dealt a severe blow to the credibility of the \\"Plot\\", but there was a public backlash also. The jurors had to flee their homes for fear of the mob, and a dead dog was thrown at Scroggs. When the Portuguese Ambassador, the Marquis of Arronches, called on Scroggs in person to congratulate him on Wakeman's acquittal (historians have called the Ambassador's action one of \\"incredible folly\\"), the public, perhaps not unreasonably, assumed that the judge had been bribed.Kenyon p.202 Wakeman went to Windsor Castle to see the queen and king, and left the country.

He was born in London, England in 1810. He completed an apprenticeship with a printer, then came to Upper Canada in 1833 with his two brothers and settled on farms there. In 1837, he went to Toronto in search of work. He joined the city guards during the Upper Canada Rebellion. He managed a newspaper for Charles Fothergill and then became a partner with booksellers William and Henry Rowsell, managing their printing operation. In 1848, he became editor for the Toronto Patriot, owned by Edward George O'Brien. In 1849, with Ogle Robert Gowan, he took over the operation of the paper. They also published the United Empire. After the partnership ended in 1853, with partners, he bought the British Colonist. In 1858, he sold this paper and set up his own called the Atlas; later that same year, he bought the Colonist back. Thompson had also served on Toronto city council from 1849 to 1854. He won the contract for government printing and so moved to Quebec City in 1859. After being accused of bias against French Canadians, he went back to Toronto in 1860. He served as managing director for the Beaver Mutual Fire Insurance Association from 1860 to 1876, when it was forced to close because of a new requirement for insurance companies to provide a large security deposit to the government. Left in a difficult financial situation at the age of 66, he became manager for a branch of the city library. In 1884, he published Reminiscences of a Canadian pioneer : for the last fifty years, 1833-1883 : an autobiography . He died in Toronto in 1886.

The goal of protein‚Äìligand docking is to predict the position and orientation of a ligand (a small molecule) when it is bound to a protein receptor or enzyme. Pharmaceutical research employs docking techniques for a variety of purposes, most notably in the virtual screening of large databases of available chemicals in order to select likely drug candidates. Several protein‚Äìligand docking software applications that calculate the site, geometry and energy of small molecules or peptides interacting with proteins are available, such as AutoDock and AutoDock Vina, rDock, FlexAID, Molecular Operating Environment, and Glide. Protein flexibility Computational capacity has increased dramatically over the last two decades making possible the use of more sophisticated and computationally intensive methods in computer-assisted drug design. However, dealing with receptor flexibility in docking methodologies is still a thorny issue. The main reason behind this difficulty is the large number of degrees of freedom that have to be considered in this kind of calculations. However, in most of the cases, neglecting it leads to poor docking results in terms of binding pose prediction in real-world settings. Using coarse grained protein models to overcome this problem seems to be a promising approach. Coarse-grained models are often implemented in the case of protein-peptide docking, as they frequently involve large-scale conformation transitions of the protein receptor.

It has a capacity of which is fed into the National Electricity Market. The power station is owned by CleanCo Queensland. Taking its name from the Aboriginal word meaning 'big water', the Kareeya Hydro project originally comprised construction of Koombooloomba Dam, the Tully Falls Weir and Kareeya Hydro power station. A dam was needed for water storage because most of the rain in the area falls in the first few months of the year. An intake tower is located in the weir, which directs water down a tunnel to the turbines in an underground power station below Tully Falls. Planning for the project began in 1949 and it was intended to be operating by 1955. Construction of a diversion tunnel started in early 1952. The 132 Kv transmission line was the first ever constructed in Queensland and the state's first use of steel towers for electricity distribution. The last of the four generating sets was installed by mid-1959. The power station's staff and families were provided accommodation in a small village, named Cardstone, located downstream from the plant. Upgrade The power station was upgraded between 2005 and 2008. This has effectively extended the life of the power station by 25 years and increased capacity, generation, efficiency and availability.

Fearnley is also the grandfather of British Olympic gymnast Nile Wilson. Birth and early life Fearnley was born in Pudsey, Yorkshire. In 1955 he had just played for the England Schoolboys team and hoped for a career in professional cricket, but during the winter months he began making cricket bats to supplement his income. The first bats Fearnley made were branded 'Tudor Rose', but soon they became known as 'Fearnley of Farsley'. Cricket career Fearnley's main aim was to play professional cricket, and though a phenomenal schoolboy cricketer, he could not make it into his home county's 1st XI, only managing to play for Yorkshire IIs. He sought trials elsewhere to fulfil his ambition and in 1960 he was given the opportunity he‚Äôd craved at Worcestershire. Fearnley was a left-hand opening batsman who played 22 times in Worcestershire's maiden Championship-winning season of 1964 but never really established himself in the side. In seven seasons he made 97 appearances, his average always hovering around 20. After leaving New Road at the end of 1968 he played for Lincolnshire, returning to Worcestershire in 1972 to captain the 2nd XI. Cricket bat company At the same time he established his highly successful eponymous bat-manufacturing company, during the early years Fearnley got many of his ex-playing colleagues and opponents to use his products. Introducing new forms of sponsorship, he built the brand around these friends. John Snow was the first to use the Duncan Fearnley bat in an international, with the likes of Basil D'Oliveira and Dennis Amiss close behind. By the early 1980s, Fearnley had become the dominant brand within the market throughout the world. At the time it seemed everyone was using or wearing the three-wicket symbol. Leading players such as Sunil Gavaskar, Clive Lloyd, Kepler Wessels, Ian Botham, Graham Gooch, Allan Lamb, Viv Richards, Graeme Pollock, Wasim Akram, Ravi Shastri, Allan Border, Martin Crowe and many more were putting their trust in the product. In 1986 he became Worcestershire's high-profile chairman. He attracted some big names ‚Äì notably Ian Botham ‚Äì and the county won two County Championships, two Sunday League titles, one Benson & Hedges Cup and one NatWest Trophy title in his 12 years as chairman, as well as more than doubling the membership. During the 1990s the marketplace changed, with many smaller brands developing, and cricket bat production started to move overseas to India and Pakistan. Fearnley firmly resisted this trend and cut production accordingly, still concentrating on totally hand-crafted bats at its factory in Worcester. The company today Today the brand still operates from its Worcester base, with a factory producing, by hand, up to 5,000 bats per year. Fearnley still remains one of the major UK manufacturers as other companies seek overseas production and is still one of the world's most recognised names in cricket, with Vikram Solanki and Darren Gough two of the main UK endorsements. New markets include Club Clothing and Ground Equipment. The company manufactures and retails clothing and accessories for the ECB Association of Cricket Officials.ECB ACO shop References External links * Cricinfo Profile * Fearnley Cricket Living people 1940 births English cricketers Worcestershire cricketers Cricketers from Pudsey Lincolnshire cricketers Cricket equipment manufacturers ","title":"Duncan Fearnley"},{"id":"5702792","text":"Qiangba Puncog, also spelled Champa Phuntsok (; ; born in May 1947) was the chairman of the government of Tibet Autonomous Region of China from 2003 until January 2010.

He saw the statue of Lord Shyam rising from the ground and stopping once it was half-way from the earth. King Jai Shingh, remembering the dream, dug out the statue of the lord and built the \\"Temple Of Shri Jai Singh Shyam\\".

The Guge and Burang kingdoms were separated about the late 11th century, when king Logtsha Tsensong founded an independent realm.

The AIDGAP series is a set of books published by the Field Studies Council. They are intended to enable students and interested non-specialists to identify groups of taxa in Britain which are not covered by standard field guides. In general, they are less demanding in level than the Synopses of the British Fauna. All AIDGAP guides are initially produced as test versions, which are circulated widely to students, teaching staff and environmental professionals, with the feedback incorporated into the final published versions. In many cases the AIDGAP volume is the only non- technical work covering the group of taxa in question.  History of the series  The Field Studies Council recognised the widespread need for identification guides soon after its inception, and has since established a long tradition of publishing such material. Many of these were written by teaching staff writing their own keys to fill obvious gaps in the available literature (see for example A key to the land snails of the Flatford area, Suffolk (1959)). However, it became increasingly apparent that a change in approach was needed. Too few guides were available which were usable by those with little previous experience. Many groups of plants and animals appeared to be neglected. The FSC initiated the AIDGAP project in 1976, with input from an advisory panel which included a range of organisations such as the Linnean Society, teachers in secondary education and professional illustrators. The two main objectives adopted by the panel were first to identify those groups of organisms regarded as 'difficult' due to a lack of a suitable key, and second to investigate ways of alleviating the difficulties of identification for each group. The panel also decided to incorporate a 'testing' stage during which the identification guides could be revised and improved. In practice today, AIDGAP guides are produced as 'test versions', which are then circulated to at least 100 volunteer 'testers', drawn from a wide range of backgrounds. Test versions are available for free download from the AIDGAP web pages. Feedback from the testers is passed anonymously to the author, then used to inform the production of the finished AIDGAP guide.

He had previously held the position from 2 June 1992 to 11 July 2006. He founded and led the Concerned Citizens' Movement (CCM), now chaired by Stedmond Tross. He was a West Indies cricketer who played for the Combined Islands and the Leeward Islands. Prime Minister Amory also served as the Minister of Sports in the Nevis Island Administration. The main airport in Nevis, The Vance W. Amory International Airport, bears his name. Prime Minister Amory was born in Rawlins Village. He received his elementary, primary and secondary school education in Nevis. He has been an active member of a local church in Nevis since childhood. Amory was known for his fondness for the game of cricket. He suffered injuries, including a broken nose; that caused him to be lifted off the cricket field. Amory was known to excel academically, obtaining passes in 5 out of available 7 GCE 'O' level subjects at Charlestown Secondary School. He subsequently achieved his ‚ÄòA' grade levels in St. Kitts, went on to University of the West Indies at Cave Hill Campus, Barbados, where he obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree. Then he returned home to continue teaching students at Charlestown Secondary School in 1973. Transferred to Gingerland Secondary School, Vance Amory, 1974‚Äì1977 and for 6 months during that period, took on the additional responsibility as acting headmaster while fulfilling his role as teacher, without additional compensation. At age 28 he became the youngest headmaster of Charlestown Secondary School. He took an institution that was lagging seriously behind and almost single-handedly restored acceptable grades and credibility. The transition from GCE ‚ÄòO' levels to CXC and the newly introduced sports programs were among some of the challenges that he overcame, despite serious opposition from others. He assisted greatly with the education improvement of thousands during his days as teacher and principal. Mr. Amory then, between 1981 and 1983, had a short stint in banking as manager of the St. Kitts, Nevis and Anguilla National Bank, during which time he aided many individuals in obtaining well needed financing. That Bank was relatively new on Nevis and had its early difficulties. Nevis residents were very cautious in doing business with the institution and Amory set his mind to change this. The bank thereafter experienced healthy financial growth. He was also instrumental in overseeing the purchase of the land on which National Bank sits today. Deciding to move forward in 1983, Amory applied for and successfully received a position in the finance department of the Nevis Island Government. He was then promoted to Permanent Secretary in Finance, under the premiership of Dr. Simeon Daniel. It was from that position that Mr. Amory learned the ins and outs of governance. He decided to sacrifice himself for the betterment of Nevis and took study leave in September 1986 to further his education at University of the Virgin Islands, St. Croix campus. He resigned his position in December of that year and reported that he wanted to dedicate himself for the betterment of Nevis. During this time he organised a political party, the Concerned Citizens Movement. Within 5 years, Nevis in 1992 he took off for new destinations and altitudes with determination to serve as Premier. His transformation of the face of Nevis can be seen in many facets. He played a substantial role in securing the funding for the construction of the airport. There were numerous regulatory obstacles strewn in path of the airport development and numerous delays by the Basseterre Government (in Saint Kitts) in extending a loan guarantee. His commitment to the successful completion of the project is one reason that the airport bears his name.

It is generally recommended for use with other antiretrovirals. It is often used with low doses of ritonavir or cobicistat to increase darunavir levels. It may be used for prevention after a needlestick injury or other potential exposure. It is taken by mouth once to twice a day. Common side effects include diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, headache, rash and vomiting. Severe side effects include allergic reactions, liver problems, and skin rashes such as toxic epidermal necrolysis. While poorly studied in pregnancy it appears to be safe for the baby. It is of the protease inhibitor (PI) class and works by blocking HIV protease. Darunavir was approved for medical use in the United States in 2006 and in the European Union in February 2007. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The fixed-dose combination medication darunavir/cobicistat (Rezolsta) is available as a single pill. Medical uses Darunavir is an Office of AIDS Research Advisory Council (DHHS) recommended treatment option for adults and adolescents, regardless of whether they have received HIV treatment in the past. In a study of patients that had never received HIV treatment, darunavir was as effective as lopinavir/ritonavir at 96 weeks with a once-daily dosing.hivandhepatitis.com , Efficacy and Safety of Boosted Darunavir (Prezista) Are Superior to Lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra) at 96 Weeks: ARTEMIS Trial, 2008-10-28, URL .

As with other antiretrovirals, darunavir does not cure HIV/AIDS. It is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in adults and children three years of age and older when co-administered with ritonavir, in combination with other antiretroviral agents.  Adverse effects  Darunavir is generally well tolerated by people. Rash is the most common side effect (7% of patients). Other common side effects are diarrhea (2.3%), headache (3.8%), abdominal pain (2.3%), constipation (2.3%), and vomiting (1.5%). Darunavir can also cause allergic reactions, and people allergic to ritonavir can also have a reaction to darunavir. High blood sugar, diabetes or worsening of diabetes, muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, and increased bleeding in people with hemophilia have been reported in patients taking protease inhibitor medicines like darunavir. Changes in body fat have been seen in some patients taking medicines for HIV, including loss of fat from legs, arms and face, increased fat in the abdomen and other internal organs, breast enlargement, and fatty lumps on the back of the neck. The cause and long-term health effects of these conditions are not known. = Drug interactions = Darunavir may interact with medications commonly taken by people with HIV/AIDS such as other antiretrovirals, and antacids such as proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists. St. John's wort may reduce the effectiveness of darunavir by increasing the breakdown of darunavir by the metabolic enzyme CYP3A. Mechanism of action Darunavir is a nonpeptidic inhibitor of protease (PR) that lodges itself in the active site of PR through a number of hydrogen bonds. It was developed to increase interactions with HIV-1 protease and to be more resistant against HIV-1 protease mutations. With a Kd (dissociation constant) of 4.5 x 10‚àí12 M, darunavir has a much stronger interaction with PR and its dissociation constant is 1/100 to 1/1000 of other protease inhibitors. This strong interaction comes from increased hydrogen bonds between darunavir and the backbone of the PR active site (Figure 2). Darunavir's structure allows it to create more hydrogen bonds with the PR active site than most PIs that have been developed and approved by the FDA. Furthermore, the backbone of HIV-1 protease maintains its spatial conformation in the presence of mutations. Because darunavir interacts with this stable portion of the protease, the PR- PI interaction is less likely to be disrupted by a mutation. Figure 3. Ribbon structure of PR with darunavir in active site: Structures colored as in Fig. 1. with certain residues partaking in hydrogen bonding further highlighted. The catalytic aspartates, 25 and 25‚Äô, are in orange and the other interacting residues in green. Right image is a magnified view of the image on the left (PDB 4qdb). =Catalytic site= The chemical activity of the HIV-1 protease depends on two residues in the active site, Asp25 and Asp25‚Äô, one from each copy of the homodimer. Darunavir interacts with these catalytic aspartates and the backbone of the active site through hydrogen bonds, specifically binding to residues Asp25, Asp25‚Äô, Asp 29, Asp 30, Asp 30‚Äô, and Gly 27 (Figure 3). This interaction prevents viral replication, as it competitively inhibits the viral polypeptides from gaining access to the active site and strongly binds to the enzymatic portions of this protein. Cost In the US and UK, healthcare costs were estimated to be lower with boosted darunavir than with investigator-selected control protease inhibitors in treatment-experienced patients. History Figure 2. Hydrogen bonds between darunavir and HIV-1 protease: The bonds with the red residues indicate hydrogen bonds that are also present between the PI saquinavir and HIV-1 protease. The hydrogen bonds with the blue residue are unique to darunavir. Darunavir was approved for use in the United States in June 2006 and for use in the European Union in February 2007. The development of first-generation clinical inhibitors was founded on creating more protease-ligand interactions through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. The first HIV protease inhibitor approved by the FDA was saquinavir, which was designed to target wild-type HIV-1 protease. However, this inhibitor is no longer effective due to resistance-causing mutations on the HIV-1 protease structure. The HIV genome has high plasticity, so has been able to become resistant to multiple HIV-1 protease inhibitors. Since saquinavir, the FDA has approved several PIs, including darunavir.

Mitch Boyer (sometimes spelled 'Bowyer', 'Buoyer', 'Bouyer' or 'Buazer', or in Creole, 'Boye') (1837 - June 25, 1876) was an interpreter and guide in the Old West following the American Civil War. General John Gibbon called him \\"next to Jim Bridger, the best guide in the country\\". He was killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Family background He was born Michelthe incorrect 'Minton' in early 20th century writings is due to his nickname 'Mitch' Boyer in 1837.according to 1840 baptismal records; Mitch himself, in the only direct information we have from him, testimony about the 1866 Fetterman Massacre, claimed he was 28 in 1867 His father, Jean-Baptiste Boyer,Camp gives 'Vital', probably a confusion with Vital Beauvais, whose surname is similarly pronounced in French was a French Canadian who was employed by the American Fur Company, trading with Sioux in the Wyoming area. Mitch's mother was a Santee Sioux. His father was killed by Indians while trapping, about 1863. Mitch's Indian name was Kar-pash. He had three full sisters: Marie, Anne, and Th√©r√®se, who seem to have been triplets born in 1840. He also had at least two half-brothers: John Boyer (c. 1845-1871), who was hanged at Fort Laramie for killing an Army scout in the first legal execution in Wyoming Territory, and Antoine Boyer (born 1852?), whom Walter Mason Camp interviewed in 1912. John, in an interview just before he was hanged, stated that there had been other siblings who had already died. Boyer was an interpreter at Fort Phil Kearny in 1868. In the fall of 1869, he married a young Crow woman named Magpie Outside (or Magpie Out-of-Doors), who became known as Mary. Their first child, also named Mary, was born in 1870. Sometime later they also had a son, apparently named Tom, but eventually called James LeForge (see below). Army scout and death at the Little Big Horn Boyer became a guide for the 2nd U.S. Cavalry, working with the Northern Pacific Railroad's survey team. From 1872 on he was employed by the Crow Agency and the US Army. In 1876 Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer requested that Boyer be transferred to the 7th U.S. Cavalry as an interpreter for the Crow scouts when Gen. Alfred Terry ordered the 7th south from the Montana Column to search for hostile Indians. Custer's regular scouts were Ree (Arikara). However, for this mission, Terry had assigned six of Lt. James Bradley's Crow scouts to the 7th (including Curley). Boyer had the additional bonus of knowing the country well. At the Crow's Nest, Boyer was one of the scouts who warned Custer about the size of the Indian village, which Custer claimed he couldn't make out. Boyer told him, \\"General, I have been with these Indians for 30 years, and this is the largest village I have ever known of.\\" After failing to convince Custer, it is reported Boyer gave away his possessions, convinced he would die in the coming battle. There was a report that Sitting Bull had offered a bounty of 100 ponies for Boyer's head. When Custer's command was divided into 3 battalions, about noon, Boyer was assigned to accompany Custer, whose battalion would be almost completely wiped out. There were only about a dozen survivors of Custer's battalion, all of whom had left it before the battle began. Soldiers in Reno's fight claimed to have seen Custer on the bluffs watching the retreat, but this was later shown probably to have been Boyer and Curley, who had ridden ahead of the main force. Boyer stayed with Custer and was killed in the Battle of the Little Big Horn. Mitch Boyer marker on Deep Ravine trail, Deep Ravine is to the right of this picture (s/sw), and about 65 yards distant. In 1984, a fire burned through much of the Custer Battlefield, enabling archaeological digs to be made. Part of a skull was found that was identified as Boyer's by comparison of the facial bones with the only photograph known of him. The skull was found to the west of the monument on Custer Hill, at what is called the 'South Skirmish Line'. Boyer seems to have been a flamboyant character. In the photograph, he is wearing a fur hat with 2 woodpeckers one on either side, and he was wearing a piebald calf's vest the day of the fatal battle. After Boyer's death, his widow Mary was taken in by his close friend, Thomas Leforge. When his own wife died, Leforge married Mary and adopted her children. This is probably when Mitch's son was renamed, as Leforge had a son of his own named Tom. Mary died in 1916.

The film is a moody psychodrama, \\"blending multiple flashbacks and dream sequences with a gloomy atmosphere.... It is one of the earliest surviving works of (F. W. Murnau).\\" It was shot at the Babelsberg Studios in Berlin. The film's sets were designed by the art director Hermann Warm.  Plot summary  A company of men meet for a hunt lasting several days at Castle Vogel√∂d, being hosted by Lord von Vogelschrey, but a sweeping rain brings the pleasure to nought and they spend their time in the inward parts of the castle. Even the not invited Count Johann Oetsch appears. He gets eschewed by other partakers of the hunt since he is reputed to have shot his own brother, Peter, a few years ago. This rumour gets nourished by a retired Judge of the District Court. The widow of the brother, the remarried Baroness Safferst√§tt, is also expected ‚Äì which makes the situation unpleasant for the host. Count Oetsch neglects this matter and remains. The Baroness is affrighted by their coming and determined to depart again. The report of the coming of Father Faramund, allied with her former husband, is kept back by her; she will make confession unto him. In the following days, Oetsch and the Baroness ‚Äì and the Baron ‚Äì accuse one another of the murder of the brother of the Count. At the same time, in flashbacks, follows a confession in stages of the Baroness, that her marriage was anything but harmonious. Her husband became more and more interested in spiritual things than in her, so that she, in the presence of Baron Safferst√§tt, a friend of her husband, had wished for something \\"evil\\" ‚Äì which in turn had falsely interpreted it and thereafter shot her husband. This common trespass had finally let her and the Baron be married, without something else to feel for each other than emptiness. The Father takes his false beard and his wig off, revealing himself as Count Oetsch who now can justify his innocence. Baron Safferst√§tt shoots himself.

Retrieved 19 February 2014. Life and family Gardner was born in Preston, Lancashire on 10 May 1912 and was educated at Hutton Grammar School. After leaving education he initially worked as a journalist. Gardner married Nina Collins in 1950 (having one son, one daughter) but was divorced in 1962. Then in 1963 he married Joan Belcher (also having one son, one daughter); this second marriage lasting until Joan's death in 1999. Gardner died in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire on 2 August 2001 aged 89. Military career Gardner served in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, surviving the sinking of two ships. In 1945 he was appointed a Commander in the RNVR and Chief of Naval Information (East Indies). Legal career Gardner became a barrister, called to the bar by Gray's Inn in 1947, and was deputy chairman of the Kent quarter sessions. He became a distinguished and a Recorder of the Crown Court from 1972 to 1985. Gardner was appointed as a Queen's Counsel in 1960 and was subsequently admitted to the Nigerian and British Guianan bars: he also appeared in the courts of Goa, the High Court of Singapore and the Supreme Court of India, besides having an extensive practice in England. He was a leading member of the Society of Conservative Lawyers, chairman of its executive committee from 1969 to 1975 and Chairman, 1975‚Äì85. Under his guidance the society produced a steady flow of influential pamphlets on suggested changes to the criminal law.

In 1987 Gardner made the first attempt to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into English law with a Private Member's Bill. Despite gathering some distinguished cross-party support (including Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone), he was unable to secure sufficient support to see his Bill into law. He was a strong advocate of Britain‚Äôs membership of the common market. ‚ÄúPulling Britain out of Europe would desolate our industries, increase our unemployment and reduce our stature in the world to insignificance‚Ä¶.isolated from Europe we should no longer be able to influence legislation or rules which govern our trade.‚Äù Gardner's major contribution to the law was the British Nationality Act 1981. Whilst in opposition in 1977, the Conservative Party asked Gardner to chair a study group to provide advice on changes to the nationality laws.

He has appeared in almost 200 pulp magazines published in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and France.  History  The original pulp dime-novel series that later became Harry Dickson began in Germany in January 1907 under the title of Detektiv Sherlock Holmes und seine weltber√ºhmten Abenteuer (Sherlock Holmes' Most Famous Cases), published by Verlagshaus f√ºr Volksliteratur und Kunst, and comprised 230 issues in total, published until June 1911. The name Sherlock Holmes was actually used for the first 10 issues. After some concern about the rights of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the series was retitled Aus den Geheimakten des Weltdetektivs (The Secret Files of the King of Detectives) with No. 11, even though the main character was still called Sherlock Holmes inside. Holmes' Doctor Watson sidekick, however, was a younger man named Harry Taxon. Sixteen issues of the original German series were adapted into French starting in October 1907 by publisher Fernand Laven for the magazine La Nouvelle Populaire under the title Les Dossiers Secrets de Sherlock Holmes (Sherlock Holmes' Secret Files) for No. 1, immediately changed to Les Dossiers Secrets du Roi des D√©tectives (The Secret Files of the King of Detectives) with issue No. 2. In December 1927, the Dutch-Flemish publisher Roman-Boek-en-Kunsthandel launched a Dutch translation of the original German series, this time entitled Harry Dickson de Amerikaansche Sherlock Holmes (Harry Dickson, the American Sherlock Holmes). The name Harry Dickson may have been inspired by that of Harry Taxon (from the German edition above), or by writer Arnould Galopin's Allan Dickson, the King of Australian Detectives which had been created in the early 1900s. Allan Dickson even met Sherlock Holmes in L'Homme au Complet Gris (The Man in Grey) (1912). The Dutch series lasted 180 issues, until May 1935. In it, Dickson's young assistant was renamed Tom Wills In 1928, Belgian publisher Hip Janssens asked writer Jean Ray to translate the Dutch series into French, for distribution in Belgium and France. The French-language edition, also entitled Harry Dickson, le Sherlock Holmes Americain, began in January 1929. Eventually, Ray became tired of translating the mediocre original stories. Using the titles and the covers from the original pre-World War I German edition (by artist Alfred Roloff, a member of the Berlin Academy) as starting points, he began to write his own stories. The French edition lasted 178 issues, until April 1938. Overview The adventures of Harry Dickson and his young assistant, Tom Wills, have delighted several generations of French readers. Because they were written by a master of horror fiction, they are far more fantasy-oriented than the true Holmesian canon. The best and most fondly remembered Harry Dickson stories are those that pit the Great Detective against some supervillains such as Professor Flax, the mad scientist known as the Human Monster, and, later, his daughter, the equally deadly Georgette Cuvelier, a.k.a. The Spider (with whom Dickson had a love-hate relationship); Euryale Ellis, a beautiful woman who had the power to turn her victims into stone and who may be a reincarnation of the legendary gorgon Medusa; Gurrhu, a living Aztec god who hid in the Temple of Iron, an underground temple located beneath the very heart of London, filled with scientifically advanced devices; the last, living Babylonian mummies who found refuge under a Scottish lake; a nefarious blood-drinking serial killer dubbed the Vampire with Red Eyes; the enigmatic, tuxedo-suited avenger known as Cric- Croc, the Walking Dead; the supervillain Mysteras, who relies on elaborate and deadly illusions; the bloodthirsty Hindu god Hanuman, etc. Harry Dickson's fame in France rivals that of Sherlock Holmes and Ars√®ne Lupin.  Fictional Biography  Based on various clues mentioned in the series, Harry Dickson was likely born circa 1890 in New York City. He was educated from childhood in England, because his father wanted him to receive a British education. He only spent three months during his summer holidays in New York where, as a child, he befriended Reginald Marlow. Dickson‚Äôs family background is unknown, but we know that Ars√®ne Lupin studied magic with a stage magician named Dickson in Paris in 1893. At age 15, Dickson was a student in England at the Pertwee Private School and solved a case involving a diamond smuggling ring. At age 20 or about, Dickson enrolled as a student at the University of South Kensington in London and became acquainted with Jean Ray‚Äôs armchair detective Mister Triggs. He also helped fellow French student Antoine de Hautefeuille solve a family mystery. Coincidentally, Arnould Galopin began recording the adventures of a young detective named Allan Dickson also in 1910 although Galopin‚Äôs Dickson is said to be Australian. In 1919, Dickson was on an official intelligence mission in post-war Berlin. There, he met the brilliant Professor Krausse, whom he much impressed. Dickson met Krausse again, ten years later, i.e.: in 1929, when he was already an established detective at 221B Baker Street. This supports the notion that Dickson‚Äôs published cases take place from the mid-1920s to the mid- or late 1930s when he was in his late thirties and early forties, which is consistent with his physical description and abilities.

Unlike other yeshivas, the Talmud Torah focused primarily on the study of Musar (\\"Jewish ethics\\") and self-improvement. Under the Leadership of Simcha Zissel Ziv The Talmud Torah was founded in the 1860s by Rabbi Simcha Zissel Ziv, known as the Alter of Kelm (the Elder of Kelm), to strengthen the study of Musar in Lithuania. In 1872, Rabbi Ziv purchased a plot of land and erected a building for the Talmud Torah, which began as a primary school and soon became a secondary school. In 1876, the Talmud Torah was denounced to the authorities, who began to watch it closely and to hound it. Many traditional Jews in Kelm saw Rabbi Ziv as a \\"reformer,\\" as his school supported unconventional prayer practices and an unconventional, musar-focused curriculum.Menahem Glenn, Israel Salanter: Religious-Ethical Thinker (New York: Dropsie College, 1953), 71-2. The curriculum of the original Talmud Torah under Rabbi Ziv's leadership was fairly unusual for a nineteenth-century Lithuanian yeshiva in two respects: 1\\\\. Significant time was devoted to Musar, work on the improvement of character traits. In most Lithuanian yeshivas, nearly the entire day was spent studying Talmud. By contrast, at the Talmud Torah, according to Menahem Glenn, \\"Musar was the chief study, while the study of Talmud was only of minor importance and little time was devoted to it.\\" 2\\\\. In addition to Jewish subjects, students studied general subjects such as geography, mathematics, and Russian language and literature for three hours a day. The Kelm Talmud Torah was the first traditional yeshiva in the Russian empire to give such a focus to general studies.Zalman Ury, The Musar Movement: A Quest for Excellence in Character Education (New York: Yeshiva University Press, 1970), 51. Under pressure from the Jews of Kelm, Rabbi Ziv decided to open his school elsewhere: he re-established it in Grobin, in the Courland province. In 1881, Rabbi Ziv returned to Kelm, where the Talmud Torah became an advanced academy for the study of Torah and Musar. Most of the students who came to study at the Talmud Torah were married. Entry to the Talmud Torah was difficult and restricted to select students from other yeshivas, who had to bring letters of recommendation from their Rosh Yeshiva. Students were chosen after they passed rigorous examinations on Musar. At its peak, the Talmud Torah had a student body of between 30 and 35 members. Rabbi Ziv established a group that was known as \\"Devek Tov,\\" comprising his foremost students. He shared a special relationship with the group's members and he worked on writing out his discourses for them. The Talmud Torah after Ziv's death Simcha Zissel Ziv died in 1898. Upon his death, his brother Rabbi Aryeh Leib Broida became the new director of the Talmud Torah. Aryeh Leib moved to the land of Israel in 1903, and his son Rabbi Tzvi Hirsch Broida (also Simcha Zissel Ziv's son-in-law) became the new director of the Talmud Torah. After Tzvi Hirsch Broida's death in 1913, Simcha Zissel's son Rabbi Nahum Ze'ev Ziv became the new director of the Talmud Torah. After Nahum Ze'ev Ziv's death in 1916, Simcha Zissel's student Rabbi Reuven Dov Dessler became the new director. He was succeeded by Simcha Zissel's sons-in-law, Rabbi Daniel Movshovitz and Rabbi Gershon Miadnik. On June 23, 1941, Nazi forces entered Kelm. Shortly after, the faculty and students of the Talmud Torah were murdered by the Nazis and their collaborators and are buried in a mass grave in the fields of the Grozhebiski farm. Notable students The Mashgichim in many of the yeshivas in Poland and Lithuania were students of the Talmud Torah of Kelm. Some were: * Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel of Slabodka * Rabbi Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler of Ponevezh Yeshiva * Rabbi Yechezkel Levenstein in Mir and then later in Ponevezh Yeshiva * Rabbi Yeruchom Levovitz of Mir * Rabbi Yosef Leib Nenedik in Kletzk * Rabbi Moshe Rosenstein in ≈Åom≈ºa * Rabbi Naftoli Trop of Radun * Rabbi Nosson Meir Wachtfogel, mashgiach ruchani of Beth Medrash Govoha, Lakewood, New Jersey * Rabbi Elyah Lopian of the Knesses Chizkiyahu Yeshiva in Kfar Hasidim, Israel. * Rabbi Hayyim Yitzhak HaCohen Bloch, Honorary President of the Union of Orthodox Rabbis of the United States and Canada.

Located in the highest valley east of the Mississippi River, the park contains the second-largest inland wetland area in the United States. The valley featured the first commercial ski development in West Virginia. History In 1950 and 1951, members of the Washington Ski Club identified the Canaan Valley side of Cabin Mountain as an opportune place for ski development, based on pilots' reports. Because of its protection from the sun, snow on that side of the mountain often remains until April or later. The club began slope development in the early 1950s,Fansler, Homer Floyd (1962), History of Tucker County, West Virginia, Parsons, West Virginia: McClain Printing Company, pg 595-6 signing a ten year operational lease with local landowners in 1954. Their slope, named Cabin Mountain Ski Area, featured two rope tows on of terrain stretching from route 32 to a height of . Runs extended down a slope with a vertical drop of . It was the first commercial ski establishment south of the Mason‚ÄìDixon line. The ski area closed in 1962. In 1955, University of Virginia School of Law student Robert Barton established Weiss Knob Ski Area, climbing the slope of Weiss Knob above the Cabin Mountain site to a height of . It featured of terrain serviced by a T-bar as well as three rope tows. This site was acquired by the state of West Virginia in 1959, so Barton reopened \\"Weiss Knob Ski Area\\" at a new site on Cabin Mountain's Bald Knob. Opening in fall 1959, the new site featured four rope tows and the first snowmaking equipment in West Virginia; in its first season, of snow fell, burying the equipment and closing the facility for the year. The resort remained open until 1970, when the impending opening of Canaan Valley Resort prompted Barton to go out of business. This new ski area was actually a redevelopment of the original Weiss Knob site; the second Weiss Knob site would be re-opened as the second home of White Grass Ski Touring Center in 1981. In 1957, the state of West Virginia made its first land acquisition with an eye toward further developing a ski industry in West Virginia. Sarah Maude Thompson Kaemmerling granted to the state in the 1950s for the formation of a state park with the stipulation that the state make a matching acquisition. The state would go on to claim more than 30 properties between 1964 and 1970. It was not until 1971, however, that the Canaan Valley Resort State Park was established centering on the ski slopes at the southern end of the Valley. In 1972, an 18-hole golf course was also constructed there. The lodge at Canaan Valley Resort State Park Lodge opened in 1977.Michael, Edwin Daryl (2002), A Valley Called Canaan: 1885-2002, Parsons, West Virginia: McClain Printing Company, pp 221-222. The park has been very successful and several private ski operations have opened nearby and in other parts of the state as well. Canaan Valley Resort Canaan Valley Resort opened for skiing in 1971, on the original site of Weiss Knob Ski Area. It offers 49 ski trails, one terrain park, and a snow tubing area. A chairlift and magic carpet access the resort's beginner skiing area, on the far right of the mountain (facing up the slope). Other than this terrain and one long green trail running from the summit to the resort base, practically all the mountain terrain is marked more difficult or most difficult. These blue and black slopes generally descend the mountain at the same pitch, regardless of their difficulty marking. A triple chair and quad chair access the resort summit; the latter also has a mid-mountain station, which is the point beginners are encouraged to offload as the upper part of the mountain is steeper. =Amenities and recreation= Canaan Valley Resort State Park features a 160 room lodge, plus 23 cabins & cottages, and 34 campsites. The park also provides hiking trails, bike trails, ski area, and an 18 hole championship- level golf course designed by Geoffrey Cornish. In 2016, a paragliding launch site was opened on Cabin Mountain, and is accessible from the ski lift. =Explosion= On Sunday, February 14, 1988, a mid-day explosion and fire in a maintenance building killed three men who were attending an air compressor for the snowmaking system. The building also contained several drums of chemicals.

Any institution issuing the dipl√¥me d'ing√©nieur must be accredited by the Commission des titres d'ing√©nieur (within the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research) which is the official administrative body responsible for evaluating higher education institutions to train professional engineers in France. Anyone found to be misusing the title of Ing√©nieur dipl√¥m√© is liable to a ‚Ç¨15,000 fine and a one-year sentence in prison. Since the signing of the Bologna Process in 1999, the European Master's Degree is also conferred by the state to the holder of a dipl√¥me d'ing√©nieur. The dipl√¥me d'ing√©nieur is also recognized in the United States by the AACRAO since 2013 as \\"Master of Science in Engineering\\".Memorandum of Understanding (AACRAO - CTI)  Grandes √âcoles and Universities in France  France is particular in that it is mainly the Grandes √âcoles in engineering that are accredited and are certified to issue the dipl√¥me d'ing√©nieur, which is differentiated from bachelor's and master's degrees in engineering issued by public universities (Universit√©s). Universities in France are comprehensive institutions composed of several faculties covering various fields (natural sciences, engineering, law, economics, medicine, humanities, etc.) with a large student body. On the other hand, Grandes √âcoles in engineering are much smaller in size and recruit their students with more selective processes (typically a few hundred students per year per institution, and a few thousand students per year country-wide). Curriculum Student engineers in Grandes √âcoles are educated in close cooperation with the various industries through academic-industry partnerships, which introduce graduates to professional life while giving them a solid grounding in their discipline. As many graduates will advance to positions leading future projects and teams, courses related to management and professional training are also included in the curriculum. In addition to the core curriculum in engineering and science, the French engineer training often includes, and is not limited to: * courses in humanities and social sciences * courses in business administration * visits to production sites * conferences and career talks by professionals * internships and research projects Professional training More than 90 percent of the French engineer programs require at least one internship (typically in a business setting) at some point in the curriculum. Most schools arrange three types of internships that train the students with progressive responsibilities, initially as observers and increasingly as actors, in order to gain a comprehensive understanding and perspective of all levels of responsibility and roles within the industry. One can distinguish ‚Äúworker‚Äù (blue-collar) internships, ‚Äúsenior technician‚Äù internships, and ‚Äúgraduate‚Äù internships where the students perform the same type of work they will do as graduate engineers. Internships are graded and constitute part of the academic degree requirements.

It was released in January 1968 on their second studio album, White Light/White Heat. Also in January 1968, the song was released as a single with the B-side \\"Here She Comes Now\\". Background \\"White Light/White Heat\\" was recorded in the course of the recording sessions for White Light/White Heat in September 1967 at Scepter Studios in Manhattan. The song's vocals are performed primarily by Lou Reed, with John Cale and Sterling Morrison performing backing vocals. The song, much like \\"I'm Waiting for the Man\\", features a pounding rock-and-roll Barrelhouse-style piano vamp. The song is about the sensations produced by intravenous injection of methamphetamine and features a heavily distorted electric bass outro played by John Cale over a single chord. This bass solo purportedly mimics the throbbing, ear-ringing effects experienced during the methamphetamine \\"rush.\\" \\"White Light/White Heat\\" was also a staple of the Velvet Underground's live performances from 1967 on. The tune appears on numerous live bootleg albums, and the nearly nine-minute version included on the group's posthumous 1969 Live double LP is one of the album's centerpieces. Reed also recorded a live version of the song in 1974, which featured on his Rock 'n' Roll Animal and Greatest Hits albums. Reed went on to perform the song with several notable musicians, including David Bowie, Metallica and the Raconteurs. David Bowie version The song was regularly performed live by David Bowie. A version he recorded in 1973 was released as a single in 1983 to promote the album Ziggy Stardust: The Motion Picture. Bowie, a long-time Velvets fan, had been performing \\"White Light/White Heat\\" since 1971. (His album of that year, Hunky Dory, features a credit to the song for having inspired Bowie's \\"Queen Bitch\\"). It had featured throughout the Ziggy Stardust Tour (including a performance with Lou Reed on July 8, 1972), been recorded by Bowie for two BBC sessions, and been slated for inclusion on Pin Ups (the backing track from this session was later recorded as a solo version by Mick Ronson in 1975). Despite this, the Ziggy Stardust ‚Äì The Motion Picture project would be the first time the song had been issued on a Bowie record, and as such it was released as a single. With Bowie at the peak of his global stardom thanks to Let's Dance, \\"White Light/White Heat\\" was considered an unusual turn for the pop audience he had attracted, and reached only #46 in the UK. Bowie performed the song during his 1987 Glass Spider Tour, a live version of which was released in 1988 (re- released in 2007) on Glass Spider. The song continued to feature in Bowie's live repertoire throughout his career. In popular culture Two traditional- music influenced versions of the song were included on the soundtrack to the 2012 film Lawless, one by The Bootleggers featuring Mark Lanegan and one by bluegrass legend Ralph Stanley. The live version of the song from Reed's Rock 'n' Roll Animal was specially covered by Julian Casablancas for the HBO television series Vinyl. It appeared on the soundtrack of the fifth episode, during a flashback to a fictional Reed gig in 1973.

Biography Born in the town of Paisley, in Renfrewshire, Scotland, Dr Weir was to become Physician Royal to King George V (reigned 1910‚Äì36; Weir his physician from 1918), King Edward VIII (reigned 1936), King George VI (reigned 1936‚Äì52), Queen Elizabeth II (physician 1952‚Äì68), and King Haakon VII (1872‚Äì1957) of Norway, whose wife Maud (1869‚Äì1938) was the youngest daughter of King Edward VII (1841‚Äì1910). Weir attended Allan Glen's School in Glasgow, a school noted for its emphasis on science. He received his medical education first at Glasgow University MB ChB 1907, and then on a sabbatical year in Chicago under the tutelage of Dr James Tyler Kent of Hering Medical College during 1908-9, along with Drs Harold Fergie Woods (1883‚Äì1961) and Douglas Borland (1885‚Äì1961). He returned to the London Homeopathic Hospital as Consultant Physician in 1910, and was appointed the Compton-Burnett Professor of Materia Medica in 1911. He rose to become President of the Faculty of Homeopathy in 1923. Weir reputedly first learned of homeopathy through his contact with Dr Robert Gibson Miller (1862‚Äì1919) head of the Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital, who had an important influence on the future Physician Royal, who he treated for boils and converted to homeopathy [Bodman, 1971]. \\"It was Dr Gibson Miller who advised Sir John Weir to go to the United States.\\" [Stewart, 1967, p. 260] This influence tended to be passed on: Dr Douglas Gibson (1888‚Äì1977) \\"became interested in homeopathy in 1936 through a meeting with Sir John Weir,\\" [Gibson obit, 1977, 225]. He spoke on homeopathy before the Royal Society of Medicine in 1932, and was knighted by King George V that same year. The renovated Manchester Homoeopathic Institute and Dispensary was opened in Oxford Street by Sir John Weir in May 1939. Weir said in an \\"address: homeopathy‚Ä¶is no religion, no sect, no fad, no humbug‚Ä¶remedies do not act directly on disease; they merely stimulate the vital reactions of the patient, and this causes him to cure himself.\\" [Sir John Weir, 1931, 200-201] Having advanced through all levels of the Royal Victorian Order he was, as a rare distinction, awarded the Royal Victorian Chain in 1949, possibly as a mark of the medical care he gave to the ailing King George VI.

Plot summary In I, Lucifer, God presents the devil with a chance of redemption by living a somewhat sinless life in a human body. Lucifer, not wanting redemption, takes God‚Äôs offer for a trial but instead takes it as a month's holiday. This story takes place in London and Lucifer lives in the body of Declan Gunn (an anagram of \\"Glen Duncan\\", the author's name), formerly a struggling writer who is suicidal. While in Declan‚Äôs body, Lucifer takes his body for granted and abuses drugs, alcohol, and sex. Not only does Lucifer still live a devilish life, but also he starts to realize what being a human is really like. He realizes there is so much going on in their lives and so much temptation, and people can‚Äôt simply do whatever they please. As Lucifer‚Äôs trial is coming to an end, he receives a visit from the angel Raphael, who attempts to help Lucifer head in the right direction. Raphael tells him the world is going to end so there‚Äôs no choice but to gain redemption from rebelling against God and be accepted back into heaven. Lucifer makes his decision. The whole story is permeated by the main character's versions of biblical episodes and his disparaging opinions about God and \\"Jimmeny\\" (Jesus). Music A soundtrack album for the novel was released by The Real Tuesday Weld. The album is also called I, Lucifer. Glen Duncan was staying in Clerkenwell with Stephen Coates of The Real Tuesday Weld while writing the novel, and so \\"the book and record grew up together\\". In their cover of ABBA's \\"The Day Before You Came\\" the band changed the lyric of the third verse which references writer Marilyn French to reference Declan Gunn, the fictional writer in the book. The 2003 Biffy Clyro album, The Vertigo of Bliss, takes its name from one of Lucifer's musings in I, Lucifer. The first track on the album is named \\"Bodies in Flight\\", which is similar to the title of a novel written by Declan Gunn, the author in the book.

A Nikkeijin (first-generation Japanese-American), Shimada emigrated to the United States in the early 1930s to follow in the footsteps of his idol Sessue Hayakawa, where he began acting in theatre before finding a steady career playing supporting roles in Hollywood films. After being interned during World War II, Shimada found a career resurgence starring opposite Humphrey Bogart in the 1949 film, Tokyo Joe. Shimada subsequently appeared in many films and television series throughout the 1950s and 60s. He also appeared in an episode (\\"And Five of Us are Left\\") of the 1960s American television series Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea in 1965. That year, he also made a guest appearance on Perry Mason as Dr. Maseo Tachikawa in \\"The Case of the Baffling Bug\\" and as Ito Kumagi in the 1962 episode \\"The Case of the Capricious Corpse.\\" In 1970, he had had a leading role in an episode of Hawaii Five-O (\\"The Reunion\\"). Arguably his most well-known role came in 1967, when he was cast as Mr. Osato, a SPECTRE agent in the 1967 James Bond film, You Only Live Twice. He later retired in the mid-1970s following appearances in Barnaby Jones and The Six Million Dollar Man and died in Encino, Los Angeles, California in 1988.  Early life  Shimada was born Akira Shimada (JP: Â≥∂Áî∞Êòé) in the city of Mito, Ibaraki Prefecture, in the Kant≈ç region of Japan. His birth date has been variously reported as both 1905 and 1906. Shimada was intrigued from early childhood by the tales of the entertainers who would visit the home of his artist grandfather, whom he visited frequently and briefly lived with. The young Shimada regularly went to the movies, and idolized cowboy star Tom Mix. After seeing Japanese expatriate actor Sessue Hayakawa in a Hollywood film, Shimada decided to emigrate to the United States to become an actor. He arrived in San Francisco in March 1924, knowing no English, on a student visa. While Shimada ultimately attended two years of college, his determination to become an actor never changed, and he remained in the United States after leaving college (during which time he was technically an illegal alien). He worked for some time as a janitor at the Granada Theatre, where he began taking acting lessons. In the following years, he moved to Los Angeles, where he supported himself as a hotel clerk and then a pressman for a Japanese- language newspaper.  Career  = 1930s = Shimada's first professional acting role was as a valet in a Los Angeles production of Hale Hamilton‚Äôs play Dear Me in 1929. He enrolled in acting courses at the studio of Katherine Hamil, and subsequently starred in a student production of The Flower of Edo, a one-act play about Japan. In June 1931, he headlined a class show in Los Angeles‚Äôs Jinnistan Grotto theater, performing scenes from Melchior Lengyel‚Äôs play The Typhoon. As the American film industry shifted to sound films, Shimada took English and speech classes, while supporting himself through odd jobs as a butler, gardener, clerk, and dishwasher. He first broke into films with a brief role in The Night Club Lady (1932), directed by Irving Cummings. Shortly afterward, he auditioned for Cecil B. DeMille. Shimada later recalled that in his first interview with the great director, DeMille stated that he was looking for a ‚Äúyoung, strong husky man who can climb a rope‚Äù for his Pacific Island epic, Four Frightened People, and he invited Shimada to climb a rope hanging in his office. After demonstrating his athletic prowess, Shinada was hired to play a ‚Äùsakai‚Äù native guide, one who clambered up the tall palms to get food and scan the horizon. He sailed to Hawaii with the cast and crew for several weeks of filming. After his work with DeMille, Shimada was hired for numerous extra roles and bit parts, mainly uncredited, as houseboys and valets. He was cast as a martial artist in the 1934 potboiler Charlie Chan's Courage. In Midnight Club, made shortly after, he was a member of a gang of jewel thieves, and he then played a gangster henchman in Public Hero Ôπü1. He appeared briefly the Claudette Colbert-Louise Beavers version of the film Imitation of Life (1934) and in Mae West‚Äôs film, Klondike Annie (1936). Yearning for better roles, Shimada's was cast in his first featured part as a comic Yokohama teahouse proprietor in Oil for the Lamps of China (1935), swiftly followed by a role as a showy servant in Revolt of the Zombies (1936). That same year, he played his first serious part, in the independently produced film White Legion. The film dramatizes the adventures of a group of heroic doctors who travel to Panama during the building of the Panama Canal in search of a cure for yellow fever. Shimada‚Äôs character Dr. Nogi (based on the celebrated Japanese-born bacteriologist Hideyo Noguchi) has special powers to resist pain and treat illness. Shimada‚Äôs last prewar role of importance was in the 1939 thriller Mr. Moto's Last Warning, in which his character was a decoy who impersonated the eponymous Japanese spy (played, ironically, by a non- Japanese, Austrian-born actor Peter Lorre). = World War II and internment = Shimada was taken by surprise by Executive Order 9066 and the mass removal of Japanese Americans. He dreamed of relocating to New York and establishing himself in the Manhattan theater world, but was unable to get away from the West Coast in time before resettlement was ‚Äúfrozen‚Äù in late March. Instead, in May 1942 he was removed to the Poston War Relocation Center. Still only in his mid-thirties and fluent in English, Shimada was a rare figure among the Issei in camp. Because of his fame as an actor, he was named production manager of a Nisei drama group, the Poston Drama Guild. The Guild performed in mess halls, putting on skits and comic sketches of camp life, including ‚ÄúComing to Boilton‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Blockhead‚Äôs Nightmare‚Äù. In fall 1942, the Guild announced a forthcoming original 3-act comedy, ‚ÄúPostonese,‚Äù depicting life in camp, to be written and directed by Shimada and his fellow actor Wilfred Horiuchi. Shimada took over an entire barrack and designed a stage for the dramatic department. An article in the Poston News-Chronicle stated that the stage had ‚Äúa synchronized platform, footlight, spotlights, ceiling and natural wood furniture.‚Äù Shimada noted, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know anything about building a stage‚Äîit isn‚Äôt in our line. But we are forced to do it because this is Poston.‚Äù The group was also forced to construct its own chairs for the theater. However, materials were scarce and the work on the theater was slow. Worse yet, during the hiatus of the construction, the Guild's original actors went into other jobs or began leaving camp, and Shimada was forced to re-cast his show‚Äîhe thought of recruiting high school students. By early 1943, the little theater was nearly completed. However, one day a fire broke out in a neighboring mess hall, and swept through the barrracks and consumed the stage and seats. The entire theater, the product of months of labor, was destroyed almost instantly. Stunned and distraught by the loss, Shimada nonetheless resolved to carry on. Armed with a certificate from the American Red Cross that authorized him to give classes in swimming and lifeguard training, he joined Captain Tetsuo Sakamoto to champion a ‚Äúbuild a pool‚Äù project. Such a swimming pool, Shimada announced, would ‚Äúcool off the griddled brains of the old-timers‚Äù and would offer all the children in the camp a chance to learn how to swim. Shimada helped recruit a group of volunteers to dig a pool and put up shade around it. (The workers also built a large diving platform‚Äîso large, in fact, that it would ultimately be converted for use as a makeshift outdoor stage for skits by the drama group as well). The new pool turned out to be wildly popular. Over the next months, Shimada supervised nineteen lifeguards who held swimming classes and cared for thousands of young Nisei swimmers. They even held a series of water carnivals with races, diving competitions, and talent shows. At the request of John W. Powell, chief of Poston's community management division, Shimada was appointed Unit I Community Activities Coordinator. ‚ÄúMr. Shimada‚Äôs proven leadership of the younger men, and his sympathetic understanding of the needs and interests fo the older people, will be of great value to the enjoyment and harmony of the residents of Unit I,‚Äù Powell told the Poston News-Chronicle. In February 1945, Shimada's residence block elected him as a block leader, and he resigned his other positions. While he felt pride in his community activities, Shimada loathed the heat and hardships of Poston and yearned to return to acting. Ironcially, during the war Hollywood had produced numerous films with villainous Japanese characters, but all were played by Chinese or Korean or white actors. Even after the end of World War II and the return of Japanese Americans to the West Coast, the other Nikkei actors who had worked in Hollywood in the 1920s and 1930s (apart from Sessue Hayakawa) would disappear from view. = Post-war career = In summer 1945, while still confined at Poston, Shimada was cast as a Filipino scout in a war propaganda film for 20th Century Studios, to be entitled American Guerilla in the Philippines. However, once Japan surrendered and the war ended in late summer 1945, the project was shelved indefinitely. Shimada later claimed that he was summoned back to Hollywood by a telegram from Paul Wilkins, former casting director at MGM, and that he swiftly made the trip back from Poston to Culver City in a milk truck, but was unable to find work once he arrived. He thus returned to his previous idea of moving to New York. Once there took up residence at the Cherrie Lane Theatre in Greenwich Village. There he stayed backstage and studied theatrical technique, even as he searched for agents and pounded the pavements for work. After several weeks of searching, Shimada found a golden opportunity. He was cast in The First Wife, a play written by the Nobel laureate Pearl S. Buck based on her own story, and performed by The Chinese Theatre, a troupe of Chinese actors that she sponsored. Shimada's role was that of Yuan, a young Chinese man who returns to his family in China after spending several years studying in the United States, and clashes with his wife because of her traditional ways. To obscure his Japanese origins, Shimada was billed under a Chinese-sounding name, ‚ÄúShi Ma-Da‚Äù. After a run in New York, he joined the show for an extended tour of the United States, and remained with the production for two years. When the show played New Orleans in February 1946, local critic Gilbert Cosulich described Shimada's lead performance as ‚Äúintelligently though a bit stiffly portrayed.‚Äù = Tokyo Joe = In 1949, Shimada was recruited back to Hollywood by Robert Lord, who had joined leading man Humphrey Bogart to form the production company Santana Productions. The two started work on Tokyo Joe, a new motion picture starring Bogart that would be set in Occupation-era Japan, and sought Japanese actors to play in it. The producers located Sessue Hayakawa, by then long absent from Hollywood and living in France, and he agreed to make a comeback role as the main villain. Meanwhile, Lord remembered Teru Shimada from Oil for the Lamps of China, on which he had been a writer, and sought him out as well. Shimada's first appearance in Tokyo Joe is near the beginning of the film. Bogart's character Joe Barrett, who had run a bar in Tokyo before the war, comes back to occupied Japan after 7 years away to take care of some unfinished business. He visits his bar, though it is formally off limits to Allied personnel. There Bogart's Joe is reunited with his old friend and partner Ito, played by Shimada, who now runs the ‚Äújoint.‚Äù While Shimada's role was originally intended to be small, as work on the film progressed he was given increasingly more to do. In fact, in the final film, Joe and Ito have a friendly judo match, and Ito succeeds in flooring his opponent. Shimada later stated that Tokyo Joe had been his most enjoyable film experience, as even people who did not know his name recognized him as the man who had beaten Bogart in a fair fight. = 1950s = Shimada's performance in Tokyo Joe led to a revival of his career in Hollywood. Soon after, he was cast as a brutal Japanese officer in Fox's Three Came Home and a villainous captain of a Chinese junk in Smuggler's Island. In The Bridges at Toko-Ri he plays a man who brings his wife and children to a Japanese bath and is surprised to find William Holden and his family already in the tub. In House of Bamboo (1955) Shimada played the uncle of Yoshiko Yamaguchi‚Äôs lead character‚Äîthe film also offered him his first chance to work together with his childhood idol Sessue Hayakawa. During this period, Shimada auditioned for the role of Sakini, an Okinawan interpreter, in the 1956 film version of the hit play The Teahouse of the August Moon, but was disappointed when Caucasian Hollywood star Marlon Brando was awarded the role. One notable Shimada role during this period was in the low-budget feature Battle of the Coral Sea (1959). In it he plays Commander Mori, a Japanese naval officer of intergrity who is tasked with interrogating his American prisoners. Abandoning torture, he tries using psychological methods to gain information from his captives. Mori displays sympathy for his victims but does not allow his feelings to interfere with his duty and loyalty to Japan. A more positive role for Shimada was in independent producer Sam Fuller‚Äôs 1959 drama Tokyo After Dark. There Shimada plays Sen- Sei, a blind instructor and mentor to the geisha Sumi who is a master of the Japanese musical instrument called the koto (in fact performed by Kimio Eto). Sumi brings her American boyfriend Bob, who has been accused of murder and is on the lam, to hide at Sen-Sei‚Äôs house. Sen-Sei has a lengthy conversation with Bob, explains to him with kindness how badly he‚Äôs been behaving, and persuades him to show faith in Japanese justice and his financ√©e‚Äôs love by surrendering himself to the authorities, rather than letting himself be smuggled out of the country. In addition to his film roles, Shimada worked steadily in TV dramas during the ‚ÄúGolden Age of Television.‚Äù Most notably, he played a lead role in The Kotaro Suto Story. In ‚ÄúThe Pearl,‚Äù an episode of the anthology series The Loretta Young Show, he appeared as a Japanese fisherman who finds a valuable pearl, but attempts to conceal this fact from his Japanese wife (played by Young). The program was so successful that ‚ÄúAn Innocent Conspiracy,‚Äù another episode with the same characters, was presented the following season. Shimada enjoyed the challenge of playing opposite Young, an experienced actress and former Oscar-winner, though he was generally ambivalent about working in television. = 1960s = During the 1960s, Shimada worked primarily in television guest spots, including one in the adventure series Journey to the Center of the Earth. According to one of the show's actors, it was a difficult experience, as Shimada had trouble pronouncing English words, and was berated on the set by the show's producer, Irwin Allen. He also played a few film roles. He had a small part in James Clavell‚Äôs drama The Sweet and the Bitter (filmed in 1962 but not released until 1967). He also played a supporting role as a Japanese landlord in the 1966 drama Walk, Don't Run. The film, set in Tokyo at the time of the 1964 Olympics, would become chiefly notable in film history as the final role of Hollywood star Cary Grant. Shimada made a different kind of notable film appearance as the narrator of the documentary ‚ÄúMy Garden Japan,‚Äù a film tour of notable public and private gardens around Japan that was screened regularly at the United Nations Pavilion at Montreal's Expo 67 World's Fair. He also had a small but memorable role in the Adam West-starring Batman (1966), a feature film version of the television series of the same name. Shimada played a Japanese delegate to the \\"United World Security Council\\" (a thinly-veiled analogue for the United Nations Security Council), whose mind is invariably swapped with one of his foreign colleagues. = You Only Live Twice = It was at this time, in early 1967, that Shimada won the role for which he would be best known, that of Mr. Osato in the James Bond film You Only Live Twice. Mr. Osato, an independently wealthy and well-respected Japanese businessman, runs Osato Chemicals, a chemical and engineering company that is in fact a front for the international crime syndicate SPECTRE. When Bond (Sean Connery) comes to see him, the suave Osato politely warns him, ‚ÄúYou should give up smoking. Cigarettes are very bad for your chest.‚Äù Mr. Osato wishes Bond well as he departs his office, then waits a few seconds, turns to his ‚ÄúConfidential Secretary‚Äù Helga Brandt (Karin Dor) and utters the succinct icy command: ‚ÄúKill him!‚Äù Shimada acted the role with relish, and received positive media attention for it. Shooting took place in Japan, and Shimada returned to his homeland for the first time in nearly 50 years. Fuji TV filmed a program recording Shimada's visit to his childhood home of Mito. = Later career = In his later years, Shimada appeared on a number of episodes of popular television series, including I Spy, Mannix, Have Gun ‚Äì Will Travel, The Doris Day Show, and The Six Million Dollar Man. One of his most notable appearances was in Hawaii Five-O. Shimada played Mr. Shigato, a millionaire Japanese businessman accused by three former prisoners of war of being the officer responsible for extreme physical and mental cruelty toward them during World War II.  Retirement  Shimada retired in his 70s, and lived in Encino. He supported himself by buying and renting out an apartment complex.  Personal life  Shimada never married (on the draft card he was issued in 1940, he listed Anna Snyder as ‚Äúnext-of-kin‚Äù). He became a U.S. citizen in 1954, and began receiving Social Security in 1970.  Death  Shimada died on June 19, 1988, at his home in Encino. He is buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery.

It spends its larval stage in the weedbeds of slow flowing rivers and when the fly emerges, the female seeks a blood meal before mating. It usually bites the lower legs causing pain, itching and swelling. Scratching the irritated areas can lead to breaks in the skin, after which secondary infection may set in. The Blandford fly's English common name derives from a major outbreak of people being bitten around the town of Blandford Forum in Dorset, England, in the 1960s and 1970s. In a four-week period during the spring of 1972, some 600 people were estimated to have visited their doctors in Blandford to be treated for insect bites. In the late 1980s, Dorset County Council asked the Institute for Freshwater Ecology (now the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology), then based in Wareham, Dorset, to investigate a means of ameliorating the problem. They suggested using a biological, bacterial insecticide, Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti), which was sprayed into the weed beds, resulting in the destruction of 80‚Äì90% of the Blandford fly larvae and a corresponding reduction in the numbers of people bitten.Evaluation of Bti - Advisory Committee on Pesticides 1994 Indeed, it is reported that the number of people bitten has dropped to less than one hundredth of those affected in 1989. Recently, the fly has begun affecting people in other parts of southern England, including built up areas, probably encouraged by water features. Singer Mollie King and golfer Ian Poulter have both been affected by bites, with the latter having to pull out of the French Open. Distribution The Blandford fly has been recorded in the following countries: Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Latvia, Germany, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Southern England, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, European Russia and Western Siberia, Slovenia, Sweden, Turkey, and Ukraine.

Foundation Feargus O'Connor, a former Irish MP forging a career in English radical politics, decided to establish a weekly newspaper in 1837. He based it in Yorkshire, one of the heartlands of the campaigns for an extension of the Factory Acts and against the controversial Poor Law Amendment Act 1834. He chose the name Northern Star in tribute to the newspaper of the Society of United Irishmen which was suppressed by the military in Belfast in 1797. Meetings were held in Leeds, Bradford, Halifax, Huddersfield and Hull; share capital was also raised from supporters in Ashton-under-Lyne, Oldham and Rochdale. ¬£690 was raised for the foundation of the Northern Star, which was first published on 22 November 1837. The newspaper An engraving of O'Connor published in the Northern Star in 1837 The newspaper paid a stamp duty of 4d., despite O'Connor's protests that the tax restricted free speech. The Northern Star reported on chartist meetings throughout Britain and its letters page was host to lively debates on parliamentary reform. The paper led a campaign in support of the working class who suffered economically due to the introduction of new technology and falling wages (notably the handloom weavers). By September 1838 it had a circulation of 10,000, and by summer 1839 this had increased to 50,000, allowing O'Connor to make a personal profit of ¬£13,000 by the end of the year. By the end of 1839, it had the second largest circulation in the United Kingdom. O'Connor used the paper to help propagate the essence of the movement, to achieve reform and the ideas of The People's Charter. O'Connor was imprisoned for 18 months in March 1840 for publishing 'seditious libels' in the paper's columns, yet in truth this was an attempt to imprison the leader of the Chartists and hence deflate the movement. The Northern Star continued to sell well, however, outstripping the 6,000 copies a week sold by Robert Hartwell's The Charter with a circulation of 48,000. Whilst in prison, O'Connor also used the paper as his means of communication with the Chartists. From its start, Northern Star was a lively and innovative newspaper. It quickly abandoned the standard practice of devoting the front page to advertisements (O'Connor's weekly letter was prominent in the columns that took their place). Unusually for a provincial paper, each issue was published in various editions (sometimes as many of eight) tailored to different regions of the country.Mussell, Jim, \\"Headnotes: Northern Star\\", Nineteenth-century Serials Edition (NCSE) http://www.ncse.ac.uk/headnotes/nss.html O'Connor presented copies of engraved portraits of Chartist heroes to regular readers, effectively pioneering newspaper \\"give aways\\".Allen, Joan, and Owen R. Ashton, Papers for the People: A Study of the Chartist Press (2005), pp. 25‚Äì53. The Star's poetry column not only printed the work of radical heroes such as Shelley and Shakespeare but hundreds of contributions by the paper's working-class readers.Chase, Malcolm, Chartism: A New History (2007), p. 119.Mike Sanders‚Äô The Poetry of Chartism, published in 2009, is a complete record of the poetry published in the Northern Star. Much of the credit for the astonishing success of the Northern Star is due to its publisher and general manager, Joshua Hobson, and the founding editor, William Hill, who was also a minister of the Swedenborgian New Jerusalem Church. In 1845 O'Connor used the Northern Star to help launch the Chartist Land Plan (the National Land Company). The same year George Julian Harney replaced William Hill as editor of the paper. Harney increasingly used the paper to advocate his internationalist outlook, for example publishing articles by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. O'Connor disapproved, accusing Harney and his supporters of being \\"Socialists first and Chartists second\\". The relationship between the two men was often tense, but as Harney told Engels: 'I must do O'C. the justice to say that he never interferes with what I write in the paper nor does he know what I write until he sees the paper'.Letter to Engels, 30 March 1846, quoted in E. Royle, Chartism (1996), p. 121. It was not until May 1850 that Harney finally resigned as editor of the paper, to concentrate on his other journalistic interests. Sales of the paper declined as the interest in the Chartist movement fell, with weekly circulation being only 1,200 by the end of 1851. O'Connor was losing interest in the campaign and sold the Northern Star to Harney in April 1852, who merged it with the Friend of the people to form the Star of Freedom. The latter appeared in a smaller format to Northern Star and to avoid the Stamp Duty printed no news. It survived only until December of the same year. =Names= *Northern Star and Leeds General Advertiser, November 1837 ‚Äì November 1844 *Northern Star and National Trades' Journal, November 1844 ‚Äì March 1852 *Star and National Trades Journal, 20 March 1852 ‚Äì 17 April 1852 *Star of Freedom, 24 April 1852 ‚Äì 27 November 1852 Literary references In Mary Barton (published in 1848), Elizabeth Gaskell describes a Sunday afternoon, in which Mary‚Äôs father John ‚Äúsat smoking his pipe by the fire, while he read an old ‚ÄòNorthern Star‚Äô, borrowed from a neighbouring public-house‚Äù.Chapter 8.

It inhabited the Mascarene island of R√©union and was part of the Western Indian Ocean radiation of kestrels. Known from subfossil bones and the writings of Dubois published in 1674, this bird was larger than its relative F. punctatus on Mauritius, being about the size of a common kestrel, or around 35 cm from head to tail, with males being noticeably smaller than females. This trait, while present in most birds of prey, is most pronounced in the larger, bird-eating species and reduces between-sex competition by niche differentiation. It can be assumed that the bird was of the same generally brownish coloration as its closest relatives, with a lighter underside and darker spots or stipples, the tail, brown or more probably grey, being banded and tipped black. Its feet were yellow and large relative to the bird's overall size. The wingspan was 60‚Äì70 cm, its wings being more rounded than those of the common kestrel - just as in the Mauritius bird - for increased maneuvrability when hunting in the forest. It is probable, but not certain, that the only difference between the sexes was their size. The bird fed mainly on birds, but certainly also on insects and the local gecko; Dubois noted that despite their small size they were able to prey on (presumably half-grown) domestic chickens. Extinction Dubois mentioned three kinds of birds of prey extant on R√©union in the early 1670s: in order of decreasing size, papangues (the local marsh harrier which still exists), pieds jaunes (\\"yellow-feet\\") and √©merillons (a term for small falcons like the merlin). It is not quite clear what name refers to the R√©union kestrel. From reviewing the evidence, the bird was most probably the √©merillon, with the pieds jaunes being either migrant falcons (the only species that might occur in the area, the sooty falcon, Eleonora's falcon and the peregrine falcon, are larger than F. duboisi was, if not in overall length, then at least in wingspan) or the juveniles of the marsh harrier, which are distinctly colored and also have yellow feet. The latter explanation seems more likely as the name was unequivocally applied to young marsh harriers in the late 19th century. Nonetheless, it seems remotely possible that the R√©union falcon's sexes were not only of different size, but also differently colored. In this case, the males would be the √©merillons and the females the pieds jaunes. This seems not likely, however, as Jean Feuilley in 1705 only mentions papangues and pieds jaunes as extant. The extinction of the R√©union kestrel, which thus seems to have been complete around 1700, is something of a mystery, just as that of the R√©union owl. Introduced predators were not present in numbers at that time and even rats probably would not have presented much of a problem for the birds. Certainly, they were considered a pest as they fed on poultry, but hunting is unlikely to have been able to reduce their population much at such an early time, as evidenced by the continuous survival of the marsh harrier, which was heavily persecuted for centuries for the same reason.

History Luigia Torelli, Countess of Guastalla (b. about 1500; d. 29 October 1559 or 1569), widowed for the second time when she was twenty-five, resolved to devote her life to the service of God. The Principality of Guastalla, which she had inherited from her father, was laid claim to by another branch of the family, and the affair carried before Pope Clement VIII and Emperor Charles V, whereupon she settled the matter by disposing of her estates to Fernando Gonzaga, thereby also increasing her resources for the religious foundations she had in mind. In 1536, she entered the Angelicals, a congregation which she had founded and richly endowed, taking the name in religion of Paola Maria; and later she established or assisted in the establishment of several other religious houses in various parts of Italy. With other Angelicals she accompanied the Barnabites on their missions, working among women, and converting numbers from lives of sin. When Pope Paul III imposed the cloister on the Angelicals, whom their foundress had destined for works of active charity, particularly the care of the sick and orphans, she instituted another community, also at Milan, for whom she built a house between the Roman and the Tosa gate, known as the College of Guastalla. Like the Angelicals, they were under the direction of the Barnabites. The members, known as Daughters of Mary, dedicated themselves to the care of orphans of noble family, eighteen being provided for in the endowment. The orphans, appointed by prominent Milanese, who eventually became administrators of the institute, may remain for twelve years, after which they are free either to return to the world, or remain as religious, receiving in the former event a dowry of 2000 lire ($400). After the death of the foundress, Pope Urban VIII, at the instance of St. Charles Borromeo, enclosed the community. The sisters since live as religious, attend choir, have their meals in common, observe definite hours for prayer, silence, and work, but take no solemn vows. Their garb is black, fashioned according to a more secular style than was that of the Angelicals and their veil is folded in a peculiar coronet form; each also wears a gold ring engraved with a hand holding a cross. Their charges dress in blue and are also popularly known as Guastallines.

The True Origins of Parallel Robots. Online article available at http://www.parallemic.org/Reviews/Review007.html Delta robots have popular usage in picking and packaging in factories because they can be quite fast, some executing up to 300 picks per minute.http://www.botjunkie.com/2009/11/03/adept-quattro-is-fastest-ever-for- the-moment/  History  pick and place robots The delta robot (a parallel arm robot) was invented in the early 1980s by a research team led by professor Reymond Clavel at the √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne (EPFL, Switzerland). After a visit to a chocolate maker, a team member wanted to develop a robot to place pralines in their packages. The purpose of this new type of robot was to manipulate light and small objects at a very high speed, an industrial need at that time. In 1987, the Swiss company Demaurex purchased a license for the delta robot and started the production of delta robots for the packaging industry. In 1991 Reymond Clavel presented his doctoral thesis 'Conception d'un robot parall√®le rapide √† 4 degr√©s de libert√©',Clavel, R. (1991) Conception d'un robot parall√®le rapide √† 4 degr√©s de libert√©. PhD Thesis, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland and received the golden robot award in 1999 for his work and development of the delta robot. Also in 1999, ABB Flexible Automation started selling its delta robot, the FlexPicker. By the end of 1999 delta robots were also sold by Sigpack Systems. In 2017, researchers from Harvard's Microrobotics Lab miniaturized it with piezoelectric actuators to 0.43 grams for 15 mm x 15 mm x 20 mm, capable of moving a 1.3g payload around a 7 cubic millimeter workspace with a 5 micrometers precision, reaching 0.45 m/s speeds with 215 m/s¬≤ accelerations and repeating patterns at 75 Hz.  Design  Delta robot kinematics (green arms are fixed length, at 90¬∞ to their blue axis that they rotate about) Over- actuated planar Delta robot. The delta robot is a parallel robot, i.e. it consists of multiple kinematic chains connecting the base with the end- effector. The robot can also be seen as a spatial generalisation of a four-bar linkage.Merlet, J.-P., Parallel Robots, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2000. The key concept of the delta robot is the use of parallelograms which restrict the movement of the end platform to pure translation, i.e. only movement in the X, Y or Z direction with no rotation. The robot's base is mounted above the workspace and all the actuators are located on it. From the base, three middle jointed arms extend. The ends of these arms are connected to a small triangular platform. Actuation of the input links will move the triangular platform along the X, Y or Z direction. Actuation can be done with linear or rotational actuators, with or without reductions (direct drive). Since the actuators are all located in the base, the arms can be made of a light composite material. As a result of this, the moving parts of the delta robot have a small inertia. This allows for very high speed and high accelerations. Having all the arms connected together to the end-effector increases the robot stiffness, but reduces its working volume. The version developed by Reymond Clavel has four degrees of freedom: three translations and one rotation. In this case a fourth leg extends from the base to the middle of the triangular platform giving to the end effector a fourth, rotational degree of freedom around the vertical axis. Currently other versions of the delta robot have been developed: * Delta with 6 degrees of freedom: developed by the company Fanuc, on which a serial kinematic with 3 rotational degrees of freedom is placed on the end effector * Delta with 4 degrees of freedom: developed by the company Adept, which has 4 parallelogram directly connected to the end- platform instead of having a fourth leg coming in the middle of the end- effector * Pocket Delta: developed by the Swiss company Asyril SA, a 3-axis version of the Delta Robot adapted for flexible part feeding systems and other high-speed, high-precision applications. * Delta Direct Drive: a 3 degrees of freedom Delta Robot having the motor directly connected to the arms. Accelerations can be very high, from 30Miller, K., \\"Modeling of Dynamics and Model-Based Control of DELTA Direct-Drive Parallel Robot,\\" Journal of Robotics and Mechatronics, Vol. 17, No. 4, pp. 344-352, 1995. up to 100 g. * Delta Cube: developed by the EPFL university laboratory LSRO, a delta robot built in a monolithic design, having flexure-hinges joints. This robot is adapted for ultra-high-precision applications. * Several \\"linear delta\\" arrangements have been developed where the motors drive linear actuators rather than rotating an arm. Such linear delta arrangements can have much larger working volumes than rotational delta arrangements. \\"Gallery of robots - prof. Reymond Clavel\\" Reymond CLAVEL. \\"Robots parall√®les\\" The majority of delta robots use rotary actuators. Vertical linear actuators have recently been used (using a linear delta design) to produce a novel design of 3D printer. These offer advantages over conventional leadscrew-based 3D printers of quicker access to a larger build volume for a comparable investment in hardware.  Applications  Large delta-style 3D printer Industries that take advantage of the high speed of delta robots are the packaging industry, medical and pharmaceutical industry. For its stiffness it is also used for surgery. Other applications include high precision assembly operations in a clean room for electronic components. The structure of a delta robot can also be used to create haptic controllers. More recently, the technology has been adapted to 3D printers. These printers are faster and can be built for about 200 dollars and compete well with traditional Cartesian printers.

The racemic form of the drug was invented by Aspro Nicholas in the early 1970s. Moussa B.H. Youdim identified it as a potential drug for Parkinson's disease, and working with collaborators at Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology in Israel and the drug company, Teva Pharmaceutical, identified the R-isomer as the active form of the drug. Teva brought it to market in partnership with Lundbeck in Europe and Eisai in the US and elsewhere. It was approved in Europe in 2005 and in the US in 2006. Medical use Rasagiline is used to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease both alone and in combination with other drugs. It has shown efficacy in both early and advanced Parkinsons, and appears to be especially useful in dealing with non-motor symptoms like fatigue.Azilect Prescribing Information Label last revised May, 2014 Rasagiline has not been tested in pregnant women and is Pregnancy Category C in the US. Side effects The FDA label contains warnings that rasagiline may cause severe hypertension or hypotension, may make people sleepy, may make motor control worse in some people, may cause hallucinations and psychotic-like behavior, may cause impulse control disorder, may increase the risk of melanoma, and upon withdrawal may cause high fever or confusion. Side effects when the drug is taken alone include flu-like symptoms, joint pain, depression, stomach upset, headache, dizziness, and insomnia. When taken with L-DOPA, side effects include increased movement problems, accidental injury, sudden drops in blood pressure, joint pain and swelling, dry mouth, rash, abnormal dreams and digestive problems including vomiting, loss of appetite, weight loss, abdominal pain, nausea, constipation. When taken with Parkinson's drugs other than L-DOPA, side effects include peripheral edema, fall, joint pain, cough, and insomnia. =Interactions= People who are taking meperidine, tramadol, methadone, propoxyphene, dextromethorphan, St. John‚Äôs wort, cyclobenzaprine, or another MAO inhibitor should not take rasagiline. The FDA drug label carries a warning of the risk of serotonin syndrome when rasagiline is used with antidepressants or with meperidine. However the risk appears to be low, based on a multicenter retrospective study in 1504 people, which looked for serotonin syndrome in people with PD who were treated with rasagiline plus antidepressants, rasagiline without antidepressants, or antidepressants plus Parkinson's drugs other than either rasagiline or selegiline; no cases were identified. There is a risk of psychosis or bizarre behavior if rasagiline is used with dextromethorphan and there is a risk of non-selective MAO inhibition and hypertensive crisis if rasagiline is used with other MAO inhibitors. Chemistry Rasagiline is molecularly a propargylamine derivative. The form brought to market by Teva and its partners is the mesylate salt, and was designated chemically as: 1H-Inden-1-amine-2,3-dihydro-N-2-propynyl-(1R)-methanesulfonate. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= Parkinson's disease is characterized by the death of cells that produce dopamine, a neurotransmitter. An enzyme called monoamine oxidase (MAO) breaks down neurotransmitters. MAO has two forms, MAO-A and MAO-B. MAO-B breaks down dopamine. Rasagiline prevents the breakdown of dopamine by irreversibly binding to MAO-B. Dopamine is therefore more available, somewhat compensating for the diminished quantities made in the brains of people with Parkinson's. Selegiline was the first selective MAO-B inhibitor. It is partly metabolized to levomethamphetamine (l-methamphetamine), one of the two enantiomers of methamphetamine, in vivo. While these metabolites may contribute to selegiline's ability to inhibit reuptake of the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine, they have also been associated with orthostatic hypotension and hallucinations in some people. Rasagiline metabolizes into 1(R)-aminoindan which has no amphetamine-like characteristics and has neuroprotective properties in cells and in animal models. It is selective for MAO type B over type A by a factor of fourteen. =Metabolism= Rasagiline is broken down via CYP1A2, part of the cytochrome P450 metabolic path in the liver. It is contraindicated in patients with hepatic insufficiency and its use should be monitored carefully in patients taking other drugs that alter the normal effectiveness of this metabolic path. History Racemic rasagiline was discovered and patented by Aspro Nicholas in the 1970s as a drug candidate for treatment of hypertension.US 3,513,244. See US patent 5453446, lines 50-60. US Patent 5453446 was the patent at issue in Teva v Watson, see page 2 Moussa Youdim, a biochemist, had been involved in developing selegiline as a drug for Parkinsons, in collaboration with Peter Reiderer. He wanted to find a similar compound that would have fewer side effects, and around 1977, at about the same time he moved from London to Haifa to join the faculty of Technion, he noticed that rasagiline could potentially be such a compound.Judy Sielg- Itzkovich for the Jerusalem Post. November 13, 2010. Making armor for the brain He called that compound, AGN 1135. In 1996 Youdim, in collaboration with scientists from Technion and the US National Institutes of Health, and using compounds developed with Teva Pharmaceutical, published a paper in which the authors wrote that they were inspired by the racemic nature of deprenyl and the greater activity of one of its steroisomers, L-deprenyl, which became selegiline, to explore the qualities of the isomers of the Aspro compound, and they found that the R-isomer had almost all the activity; this is the compound that became rasagiline. They called the mesylate salt of the R-isomer TVP-1012 and the hydrochloride salt, TVP-101. Teva and Technion filed patent applications for this racemically pure compound, methods to make it, and methods to use it to treat Parkinsons and other disorders, and Technion eventually assigned its rights to Teva.Teva v Watson, see page 2 Teva began development of rasagiline, and by 1999 was in Phase III trials, and entered into a partnership with Lundbeck in which Lundbeck agreed to share the costs and obtained the joint right to market the drug in Europe. In 2003 Teva partnered with Eisai, giving Eisai the right to jointly market the drug for Parkinson's in the US, and to co-develop and co-market the drug for Alzheimers and other neurological diseases.Eisai Press Release. May 15, 2003 It was approved by the European Medicines Agency for Parkinson's in 2005 and in the US in 2006.Richard B. Silverman, Mark W. Holladay. The Organic Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Action, 3rd Edition. Academic Press, 2014 Research Rasagiline was tested for efficacy in people with multiple system atrophy in a large randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind disease-modification trial; the drug failed. Teva conducted clinical trials attempting to prove that rasagiline did not just treat symptoms, but was a disease-modifying drug - that it actually prevented the death of the dopaminergic neurons that characterize Parkinson's disease and slowed disease progression. They conducted two clinical trials, called TEMPO and ADAGIO, to try to prove this. The FDA advisory committee rejected their claim in 2011, saying that the clinical trial results did not prove that rasagiline was neuroprotective. The main reason was that in one of the trials, the lower dose was effective at slowing progression, but the higher dose was not, and this made no sense in light of standard dose-response pharmacology.Vadim Sviderski for Reuters and Haaretz.

She sailed for Sitmar Cruises, Princess Cruises, P&O; Cruises Australia, and Pullmantur Cruises. Under ownership of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., the ship had been laid up since 2010 before being handed over to STX France in 2013 as a partial payment for the construction of what is now, Harmony of the Seas. She was later sold to a shipbreaker in Aliaƒüa, Turkey, renamed Antic, and scrapped on 14 April 2013. History Sky Princess in Auckland, New Zealand in February 2000 FairSky was built in 1984 by Chantiers de Nord et de la Mediterranee of La Seyne-Sur Mer in France for the Italian cruise company, Sitmar Cruises. In keeping up with the rest of the Sitmar fleet, she was originally named FairSky and was registered in Liberia. In September 1988, when Sitmar was purchased by P&O; Cruises, she was renamed the Sky Princess for P&O;'s Princess Cruises subsidiary and re-registered in London. Pacific Sky in Port Douglas, Queensland, Australia. Sky Princess sailed her last cruise for Princess Cruises in October 2000, arriving in Sydney on 23 October, where she was to be transferred to P&O; Cruises Australia under the name, Pacific Sky, after a $10 million refurbishment at Cairncross Dockyard in Brisbane. Replacing the 1957-built Fair Princess, Pacific Skys was quickly accepted by Australian cruise passengers. Between 2000 and 2006, Pacific Sky carried 275,000 passengers on 200 cruises. Her popularity prompted the expansion of the P&O; Australia fleet to include Pacific Sun (2004), Pacific Dawn (November 2007), Pacific Jewel (2009) and Pacific Pearl (2010). Sky Wonder in Dubrovnik, Croatia. In May 2006, the transfer from P&O; Cruises Australia to Pullmantur Cruises in Spain was made, after a series of 33 seven-day cruises based out of Singapore. Sky Wonder was registered in Valletta, Malta. The Italian-built Regal Princess took Sky Wonders place in the P&O; Cruises fleet in mid-2007 as the Pacific Dawn. From March 2009 on, Sky Wonder was laid up in Piraeus. In April 2009, she was renamed Atlantic Star and sailed for the Portuguese market. Atlantic Star at sea. In January 2010, Kyma Ship Management expressed interest in purchasing the ship,http://www.shipsmonthly.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=168:pullmantur- future-of-atlantic-star&catid;=51:cruise&Itemid;=66 but they backed out due to the high cost of replacing the steam turbines with diesel engines. It was speculated that she would be operating on charter for a German tour operator as Mona Lisa previously did, but the vessel remained moored in Marseille, France until March 2013.http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/shipdetails.aspx?MMSI=256205000 In January 2013, it was announced that the ship had been transferred to STX France as part of the deal with the new order of the Oasis-class cruise ship ordered by Royal Caribbean International. In March 2013 it was reported that the ship had departed under tow for Suez, Egypt, and on 14 April 2013, Atlantic Star arrived the shipbreaking yard in Aliaga, Turkey, under the name Antic. General characteristics Promenade deck on the Sky Wonder Atlantic Star was in length and in width at her widest point. Her draft was approximately , but this figure varies with respect to the amount of stores, fuel and water on board. The size of a cruise ship is expressed in gross tonnage, which is actually a measurement of the vessel's volume and not the actual weight. Atlantic Star measured . Atlantic Star was powered by steam turbines and was one of the last steam turbine cruise ships in the world. While at sea, she operated on two or three boilers depending on the speed required. When two were in use, she could achieve a maximum speed of ; when all three boilers were in use, she could steam at a maximum of . At full speed, she would consume up to 220 tonnes of fuel oil a day. The vessel had two fixed pitch propellers and a single rudder. She was fitted with one bow thruster and one stern thruster for maneuvering at ports Atlantic Star was fitted with two retractable stabilizer fins, which could be extended either individually or together depending on the sea conditions. Each fin was long and wide. They were controlled by hydraulic rams and were fed information from gyroscopes which sense the vessel's rolling motion. When in use, they could reduce the amount of the vessels roll by up to 85% but they had no effect on the ship's pitching motion. Atlantic Star had two anchors. Each anchor weighed nine tonnes and was attached to approximately 80 tonnes of anchor chain.  Incidents  Atlantic Star was involved in many incidents during her career. Some are listed below in chronological order. * September 2002 - Dianne Brimble, 42, of Brisbane, died after overdosing on the drug GHB. An inquest found that her drink had been spiked while on a 10-day cruise of the Pacific. * January 2005 - Pacific Sky was due to begin a scheduled cruise off the Indian coast, but could not sail after a swarm of jellyfish blocked a cooling water intake. The engines had automatically shut down, leaving the vessel stuck fast at its Brisbane River berth. The shutdown also triggered the automatic dumping of vast quantities of distilled water used by the ship's boilers - and a fresh supply had to be trucked. * 1 April 2005 - P&O; Cruises was forced to cancel another two Pacific Sky cruises to allow extended work on the ship‚Äôs troublesome starboard gearbox. P&O; Cruises said the two-month layoff would lead to the cancellation of five cruises but was confident problems would have been fixed in time for its scheduled 4 June cruise.Two more Pacific Sky cruises cancelled * 7 March 2006 - Hundreds of passengers on a seven night cruise were left stranded for about 30 hours after the vessel broke down in the Malacca Strait near Singapore. About five hours after leaving Singapore the ship experienced problems with its starboard engine and came to a halt with more than 1300 passengers on board. Crew tried to fix the problem but were unsuccessful.Pacific Sky stranded into troubled waters * 18 January 2007 - Early in the morning, the Sky Wonder with 1600 passengers ran aground on a sandbar in the Rio de la Plata, 3 kilometres from the port of Buenos Aires, Argentina. There were no injuries other than a heart problem suffered by a 50-year-old male passenger, who was treated ashore. The ship was freed by tugboats at high tide several hours later, so she could reach her destination of Punta Del Este, Uruguay.Playfuls.com - Play your life! She was chartered for CVC Cruises at the time. The grounding was reported to be a navigational error, made by her captain.

Pantethine was discovered by Gene Brown, a PhD student at the time. Pantethine is two molecules of pantetheine linked by a disulfide bridge. Pantetheine is an intermediate in the production of coenzyme A by the body. Most vitamin B5 supplements are in the form of calcium pantothenate, a salt of pantothenic acid, with doses in the range of 5 to 10 mg/day. In contrast, pantethine is sold as a dietary supplement for lowering blood cholesterol and triglycerides at doses of 500 to 1200 mg/day. Dietary supplement Pantethine is available in the United States as a dietary supplement because of evidence for lowering elevated LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides and raising HDL-cholesterol. In multiple clinical trials of patients with elevated cholesterol and triglycerides, total and LDL cholesterol were decreased by an average of 12%, triglycerides decreased by 19%, and HDL cholesterol was increased by 9% in clinical trials with daily intakes ranging from 600 to 1200 mg/day. Physiological effects Although pantethine can serve as a precursor for generation of vitamin B5 and consumption of therapeutic amounts of pantethine results in higher circulating concentrations of vitamin B5, this is not thought to be the mechanism of action. Vitamin B5 requirements are on the order of 5 mg/day. High doses of vitamin B5 do not result in the lipid changes seen with pantethine.Two mechanisms of action are proposed for pantethine. In the first, pantethine serves as the precursor for synthesis of coenzyme A. CoA is involved in the transfer of acetyl groups, in some instances to attach to proteins closely associated with activating and deactivating genes. By this theory, either the genes responsible for cholesterol and triglyceride synthesis are suppressed or the genes governing the catabolism of compounds are turned on. In the second theory, pantethine is converted to two pantetheine molecules which are in turn metabolized to form two pantethenic acid and two cysteamine molecules. Cysteamine is theorized to bind to and thus inactivate sulfur-containing amino acids in liver enzymes involved in the production of cholesterol and triglycerides. What is known is that high doses of the related vitamin - pantothenic acid - has no effect on lipids.

After serving as a councillor on the Glasgow Corporation, he was Member of Parliament for Glasgow Provan for 23 years. He has been described as the last \\"Red Clydesider\\".  Early life  Brown was born in Glasgow, Scotland, where his father was a Clydeside engineer. He was educated at Allan Glen's School and Whitehill Secondary School, Glasgow. He left school aged 14 to work at the Post Office, and played semi-professional football at Shettleston Juniors. By 1935 he was a temporary postman-messenger and by 1937 a sorting clerk and telegraphist. Both of his parents were members of the Independent Labour Party, which he also joined in 1935. He moved over to the Labour Party in 1946. He became a civil servant in 1947 at the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance. In 1947 he married Mary Carmichael, daughter of ILP and then Labour MP Jimmy Carmichael and sister of future Labour MP and peer Neil Carmichael, and he served as a councillor on the Glasgow Corporation from 1954. He became a magistrate in 1961.  Political career  Brown left the civil service in 1962, when he was selected as a prospective parliamentary candidate, and served as MP for Glasgow Provan from 1964 until he retired in 1987. His constituency in north-east Glasgow had a high rate of unemployment, included several large public sector housing estates, including Easterhouse and Blackhill, and also covered Barlinnie Prison. His political views lay to the left-wing of the party, and his parliamentary interests concentrated mainly on constituency and Scottish matters. After winning the ballot for Private Members Bills one year, he successfully pushed through his bill to become the Employer's Liability (Defective Equipment) Act 1969. He was Parliamentary Private Secretary to Judith Hart, the Paymaster-General, and served as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland during the 1974‚Äì1979 Labour government, dealing with home affairs, housing and agriculture and fisheries. After Iceland expanded its claimed fishing territory to 200 nautical miles, Brown joined the MP for Grimsby, Tony Crosland, as British negotiator with Iceland during the third Cod War, in 1976‚Äì77. Brown was praised for the role he played in resolving the dispute both by the Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, and by the Icelandic Government. He survived a reselection challenge by a Militant candidate before the 1983 general election, and retired before the 1987 general election. His successor, Jimmy Wray, was also closely challenged by Militant. In later life, he was a director of Margaret McIver Limited, which owned a ballroom and market in Glasgow. In retirement, he enjoyed playing golf and listening to jazz, particularly Django Reinhardt. His wife died in 2000. He died in Glasgow in 2008, and was survived by his daughter.

The song was written about his local pub at Taylors Arm, New South Wales, adapted by Gordon Parsons from the original poem \\"A Pub Without Beer\\" by Irish poet Dan Sheahan of Ingham, North Queensland, in the Day Dawn Hotel, now known as Lees Hotel, Ingham, Queensland. The song gently explores the \\"devastation\\" caused to a pub and its community when its beer supply is interrupted. The song was first performed in public by Gordon Parsons in 1954 at the 50th birthday of George Thomas, a resident of Creek Ridge Road, Glossodia (near Windsor in Sydney). It was performed with an extra verse that was dropped from Slim Dusty's recorded version, because it contained elements of blue humour. In January 2018, as part of Triple M's \\"Ozzest 100\\", the 'most Australian' songs of all time, \\"A Pub with No Beer\\" was ranked number 45. Australia In 1957, \\"A Pub with No Beer\\" became the first Australian single to become a gold record and was the biggest-selling record by an Australian at the time. It was the first single by an Australian artist to enter the British charts, reaching number three. In 1959, Dusty wrote and recorded a sequel, \\"The Answer To A Pub With No Beer\\", explaining the reason for the beer delivery truck's failure to arrive and describing the townsmen's efforts to solve the problem. Another sequel, \\"The Sequel to a Pub with No Beer\\", shows that the town now has a guaranteed delivery, thanks to air freight. In May 2001, Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) celebrated its 75th anniversary by naming the Best Australian Songs of all time. As decided by a 100 strong industry panel, \\"A Pub With No Beer\\" was ranked fifth on the list. In June 2008, the song was included in the National Film and Sound Archive's Sounds of Australia registry. Europe Belgian entertainer Bobbejaan Schoepen recorded the song in several languages. His Dutch version (\\"Caf√© zonder bier\\") debuted in 1959 and his German version (\\"Ich steh an der Bar und ich habe kein Geld\\") in 1960. Both became number one hits in Belgium and in Austria. The song remained in the German charts for 30 weeks, where it reached number six. \\"A Pub with No Beer\\" is also the theme song and title of a 1962 Belgian-British film starring Bobbejaan Schoepen, also known as De Ordonnans and At the Drop of a Head. In 1999, the alternative rock band Dead Man Ray wrote (partly) a new soundtrack for the film and went on tour with it in the Low Countries. The band also covered the song and released it on one of their albums. Canada This song was very popular in Ontario, Canada, following a strike by brewery workers. Starting on Thursday, August 7, 1958, when 1,200 Brewers Warehousing Ltd. (Brewers Retail) employees walked off their jobs over pay, layoffs became industry wide as retail beer was no longer available. Originally aimed at Brewers Warehousing, the dispute quickly spread as contracts at various breweries across Ontario came up for renewal. Their actions stopped the flow of beer from various breweries for 48 days and sales of hard liquor increased 25 percent. Non-unionized Formosa Spring operated at full capacity until it ran out of beer August 29, 1958. Many people purchased beer smuggled in from US and Quebec with bootleggers collecting up to C$20.00 for a case of 24 pints (previously sold at C$4.25). This song could be heard daily on most radio stations during the beer strike. United States In 1964, Benny Barnes from Beaumont, Texas, Americanized the lyrics to \\"A Pub with No Beer\\" and titled it \\"Bar with No Beer.\\" The song became a regional hit on the Hall-Way label. The melody of the song is almost identical to Stephen Foster's \\"Beautiful Dreamer\\". \\"Bar with No Beer\\" was recorded by Tom T. Hall in 1985 on the album Song in a Seashell. Johnny Cash, who also performed the song, advised him to record it.

The son of a neurologist, he was educated at Summer Fields School in Summertown, Oxford, followed by Eton College and the University of Geneva. Career After national service with the Scots Guards, Brinton studied acting and production at the Central School of Speech and Drama. He then joined the BBC as an announcer and newsreader and moved in 1959 to ITN, where he was a newscaster until 1962. He was also a regular presenter of Roundabout on the BBC Light Programme between 1964 and 1967. Brinton was a Kent County Councillor from 1974 to 1981 and Member of Parliament (MP) for the marginal seat of Gravesend from 1979 (gaining the seat from Labour) to 1983, and, following boundary changes, for the new Gravesham constituency from 1983 until he stood down in 1987. In 2003, he became a member of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP). =Alternative 3= Brinton was the presenter and narrator of the mockumentary Alternative 3, and lent it the gravitas it needed to be a successful hoax. The programme had been due to be broadcast on April Fools' Day, 1977, but industrial action meant that it was broadcast in June. Sometimes cited as a British parallel to Orson Welles's radio production of The War of the Worlds, Alternative 3 purported to be an investigation into Britain's contemporary \\"brain drain\\". Alternative 3 was supposedly a plan to relocate a cross section of Earth's scientific and philosophical population to Mars in the event of climate change or some other planetary catastrophe.

His musical work expands from electronic breakbeats to experimental electronica while occasionally touching the area of club music and pop. He describes his own music as \\"Eclectica\\". He was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, but grew up in Germany for most of the time. He was one third of the Electronic Body Music / Synthpop-Formation \\"Der Liederkranz\\" in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He has organised and co-organised many activities in Cologne's electronic music underground including \\"Mos Eisley\\" (with DJ Tetsuo), \\"Twist'n'Shout\\" (with Uh- Young Kim), \\"Is It Now?\\", \\"Radical Love Area\\", \\"Vectrax\\" (with Telekolleck), \\"Propellor Knights\\", \\"Lights!

He has also run the two record labels named Bored Beyond Belief (1995‚Äìalong with Wolfgang Schreck from Big Noise fame) and Serve & Destroy Recordings, the latter being his own label platform. Currently he is one of the resident-DJs of \\"Ehrenfeld Calling\\", a colognian monthly event featuring both breakbeat and techno-orientated music. Bob Humid was also the technological editor for the German Groove Magazine for almost six years as a successor to Christian Rindermann (aka C-Rock). He gained reputation in the German Keyboards / Sound & Recording Magazine where he worked as a technological author as well. Along testing studio and DJ gear he is a producer with an affinity for detail. Over the years he has gained a growing reputation as a dedicated mastering engineer. Under the credit of his own studio \\"Fat Of Excellence\\", which he runs together with Numinos, he mastered countless records for Boxer Sport, Mathias Schaffhaeuser's Ware Records, Pagoda London, Plasteline, Audiolith, Patrick Alavi, Kitbuilders, Dan Curtin, Plemo, Der Tante Renate, Bratze and many other independent labels and artists. His work also includes sound design for various companies such as Native Instruments, Magix (Samplitude, Sequoia) and U-He (Satin). His more recent works are productions for the highly acclaimed Leipzig-based band Brockdorff Klang Labor for whom he produced half of the tracks of the album \\"Die F√§lschung der Welt\\", along with one of Germany's most known producers for alternative music, Tobias Levin. Over the time, Bob Humid has worked, produced, and remixed with such people and groups as: twila.too, Carla Subito (Fetisch Park), Holger Czukay (Can), Fabian Stall (Zero Cash), Oliver Twist Kooperationen, Brockdorff Klanglabor, Igor Sirodzha, Daniel Myer (Dots And Dashes, Haujobb), Bernhard Deissler (Videos), Alexander Gerdes, Numinos, Coloma, Mathew Mercer, Carlsbop, Der Liederkranz, Decomposed Subsonic (aka Valour), Uh-Young Kim, Telekolleck (British Botschaft), Peter Licht, Djamel Laroussi and Mathias Schaffh√§user (Ware Records). Album Releases Twisted Repairs (Serve & Destroy / Groove Attack) ‚Äì 2001 His debut twin-album release Twisted Repairs (see also \\"Twisted Despairs\\") draws a sharp line between the musical styles of labels such as Rephlex and Certificate 18. It features elements of IDM, Techstep, Drum'n'Bass and some vocal production. It also features sophisticated beat-programming and a unique editing where every sound has a meaningful feel to it. Bob Humid has an obsession for Funk within 4/4th metrics and a digital production philosophy that he claims to be influenced a lot by Rupert Hine in his early 1980s phase . It can be noted that it is one of the first electronic works that feature object-oriented editing, a feature only available in the Digital Audio Workstation Samplitude back in 2001. While being distributed worldwide by Groove Attack, both debut albums have been solely promoted in Germany, where they have been highly acclaimed by the local press. Twisted Despairs (Serve & Destroy / Groove Attack) ‚Äì 2001 This album can be considered the \\"Evil Twin-Brother\\" of \\"Twisted Repairs\\". It is the effort of the artist to perform a remixed variation of his own work in Twisted Repairs. Bob Humid intended to make \\"Twisted Despairs\\" sound as if the original album would have been remixed in a far away future and brought to present times by mysterious ways of time-travel. Therefore, it leaves the paths of abstract Drum'n'Bass behind, while serving a wild and eclectical mix of electronic genres, heavily covered under a lot of DSP-Processing and hundreds of layers of effects and filtering-techniques. It extensively features sounds generated with Coagula, an Image Synthesizer programmed by Rasmus Ekman. Second Wind Phenomenon (Suburban Trash / Serve & Destroy) ‚Äì 2006 Five years after his debut album \\"Twisted Repairs\\" Bob Humid has changed his look at Electronic Music. \\"Second Wind Phenomenon\\" is a mature musical oeuvre that combines elements of Soundtrack, Science-Fiction, Psychedelia, IDM, Drill'n'Bass and Radioplays. Being a real concept-album, inspired a lot by the way Bands like Godley & Creme, The Legendary Pink Dots or Coil (band) produced their albums, it is very diverse and eclectical while slightly touching all kind of musical styles. The production defines the limits of what is possible in modern music-production as up to date. It features binaural microphoning- techniques and a lot of unusual vocal production. Along the participants we find the names of Holger Czukay (Can), Igor Sirodzha, Coloma, twila.too and Carla Subito (Fetisch Park). The CD Extra-Zone of the CD-version (a double- vinyl version is available) contains a XviD-version of \\"Angst\\", a 16mm short- movie by filmmaker Alexander Gerdes for whom Bob Humid has written the soundtrack and score. The idea of the album-artwork was strongly inspired by the psychedelia-art of Heinz Edelmann who was responsible for the pop-art-look in Yellow Submarine (film).

After initial immunization, a booster injection or booster dose is a re-exposure to the immunizing antigen. It is intended to increase immunity against that antigen back to protective levels, after memory against that antigen has declined through time. For example, tetanus shot boosters are often recommended every 10 years, before which memory cells specific against tetanus have lost their function or undergone apoptosis. The need for a booster dose following a primary vaccination is evaluated in several ways. One way is to measure the level of antibodies specific against a disease, a few years after the primary dose is given. Anamnestic response, the rapid production of antibodies after a stimulus of an antigen, is a typical way to measure the need for a booster dose of a certain vaccine. If the anamnestic response is high after receiving a primary vaccine many years ago, there is most likely little to no need for a booster dose. People can also measure the active B and T cell activity against that antigen after a certain amount of time that the primary vaccine was administered, or determine the prevalence of the disease in vaccinated populations. If a patient receives a booster dose but already has a high level of antibody, then a reaction called an Arthus reaction could develop, a localized form of Type III hypersensitivity induced by high levels of IgG antibodies causing inflammation. The inflammation is often self-resolved over the course of a few days, but could be avoided altogether by increasing the length of time between the primary vaccine and the booster dose. It is not yet fully clear why some vaccines such as hepatitis A and B are effective for life, and some such as tetanus need boosters. The prevailing theory is that if the immune system responds to a primary vaccine rapidly, the body does not have time to sufficiently develop immunological memory against the disease, and memory cells will not persist in high numbers for the lifetime of the human. After a primary response of the immune system against a vaccination, memory T helper cells and B cells persist at a fairly constant level in germinal centers, undergoing cell division at a slow to nonexistent rate. While these cells are long-lived, they do not typically undergo mitosis, and eventually, the rate of loss of these cells will be greater than the rate of gain. In these cases, a booster dose is required to \\"boost\\" the memory B and T cell count back up again.  Polio booster doses  In the case of the polio vaccine, the memory B and T cells produced in response to the vaccine persist only six months after consumption of the oral polio vaccine (OPV). Booster doses of the OPV were found ineffective, as they, too, resulted in decreased immune response every six months after consumption. However, when the inactive polio vaccine (IPV) was used as a booster dose, it was found to increase the test subjects' antibody count by 39‚Äì75%. Often in developing countries, OPV is used over IPV, because IPV is expensive and hard to transport. However, in places where polio is still present, following up an OPV primary dose with an IPV booster may help eradicate the disease. In the United States, only the IPV is used. In rare cases (about 1 in 2.7 million), the OPV has reverted to a strengthened form of the illness, and caused paralysis in the recipients of the vaccine. For this reason, the US only administers IPV, which is given in four increments (3 within their first year and a half after birth, then one booster dose between the ages 4‚Äì6).  Hepatitis B booster doses  The need for a booster dose for hepatitis B has long been debated. Studies in the early 2000s that measured memory cell count of vaccinated individuals showed that fully vaccinated adults (those that received all three rounds of vaccination at the suggested time sequence during infancy) do not require a booster dose later in life. Both the CDC and Canadian National Advisory Committee supported these recommendations by publicly advising against the need for a hepatitis B booster dose. However, immuno-repressed individuals are advised to seek further screening to evaluate their immune response to hepatitis B, and potentially receive a booster dose if their B and T cell count against hepatitis B decrease below a certain level.{{citation needed}]  Tetanus booster dose  The tetanus disease requires a booster dose every 10 years, or in some circumstances immediately following infection of tetanus. Td is the name of the booster for adults, and differs from the primary dose in that it does not include immunization against pertussis (whooping cough). While the US recommends a booster for tetanus every 10 years, other countries, such as the UK, suggest just two booster shots within the first 20 years of life, but no booster after a third decade. Neonatal tetanus is a concern during pregnancy for some women, and mothers are recommended a booster against tetanus during their pregnancy in order to protect their child against the disease.  Whooping cough booster dose  Whooping cough, also called pertussis, is a contagious disease that affects the respiratory tract. The infection is caused by a bacterium that sticks to the cilia of the upper respiratory tract and can be very contagious. Pertussis can be especially dangerous for babies, whose immune system are not yet fully developed, and can develop into pneumonia or result in the baby having trouble breathing. DTaP is the primary vaccine given against pertussis, and children typically receive five doses before the age of seven. Tdap is the booster for pertussis, and is advised in the US to be administered every ten years, and during every pregnancy for mothers. Tdap can also be used as a booster against tetanus. Upon its invention in the 1950s, the pertussis vaccine was whole-cell (contained the entire inactivated bacterium), and could cause fever and local reactions in people who received the vaccine. In the 1990s, people in the US started using acellular vaccines (contained small portions of the bacterium), that had lower side effects but were also less effective at triggering an immunological memory response, due to the antigen presented to the immune system being less complete. This less effective, but safer vaccine, led to the development of the booster Tdap.

The film was written, directed and edited by three friends (Justin Burns, Bob Kelly and John Maguire). All sound and camera equipment was borrowed from a local community group. Many interior shots were filmed at a local public house, where the crew were allowed to take over the function suite for two and a half days. Catering was supplied by a local bakery. Costumes were either borrowed or provided by the cast. Once most elements were in place producer/director Bob Kelly approached actor David Hayman to ask for advice. However, David was so impressed by Bob's enthusiasm and progress he offered to star in the movie. On the same day Zal Cleminson and Chris Glen from The Sensational Alex Harvey Band were with David Hayman. Being musicians they asked about the soundtrack. Bob informed them the soundtrack would be created by another friend, Stephen Maguire. They offered to help and a meeting and jam session with Stephen was set up. Stephen and The Sensational Alex Harvey Band got on well, so agreed to work on the soundtrack together.

Virtual screening has been defined as the \\"automatically evaluating very large libraries of compounds\\" using computer programs. As this definition suggests, VS has largely been a numbers game focusing on how the enormous chemical space of over 1060 conceivable compounds can be filtered to a manageable number that can be synthesized, purchased, and tested. Although searching the entire chemical universe may be a theoretically interesting problem, more practical VS scenarios focus on designing and optimizing targeted combinatorial libraries and enriching libraries of available compounds from in-house compound repositories or vendor offerings. As the accuracy of the method has increased, virtual screening has become an integral part of the drug discovery process. Virtual Screening can be used to select in house database compounds for screening, choose compounds that can be purchased externally, and to choose which compound should be synthesized next.  Methods  There are two broad categories of screening techniques: ligand- based and structure-based. The remainder of this page will reflect Figure 1 Flow Chart of Virtual Screening. = Ligand-based = Given a set of structurally diverse ligands that binds to a receptor, a model of the receptor can be built by exploiting the collective information contained in such set of ligands. These are known as pharmacophore models. A candidate ligand can then be compared to the pharmacophore model to determine whether it is compatible with it and therefore likely to bind. Another approach to ligand-based virtual screening is to use 2D chemical similarity analysis methods to scan a database of molecules against one or more active ligand structure. A popular approach to ligand-based virtual screening is based on searching molecules with shape similar to that of known actives, as such molecules will fit the target's binding site and hence will be likely to bind the target. There are a number of prospective applications of this class of techniques in the literature. Pharmacophoric extensions of these 3D methods are also freely-available as webservers. = Structure-based = Structure-based virtual screening involves docking of candidate ligands into a protein target followed by applying a scoring function to estimate the likelihood that the ligand will bind to the protein with high affinity. Webservers oriented to prospective virtual screening are available to all. = Hybrid methods = Hybrid methods that rely on structural and ligand similarity were also developed to overcome the limitations of traditional VLS approaches. This methodologies utilizes evolution‚Äêbased ligand‚Äêbinding information to predict small-molecule binders and can employ both global structural similarity and pocket similarity. A global structural similarity based approach employs both an experimental structure or a predicted protein model to find structural similarity with proteins in the PDB holo‚Äêtemplate library. Upon detecting significant structural similarity, 2D fingerprint based Tanimoto coefficient metric is applied to screen for small-molecules that are similar to ligands extracted from selected holo PDB templates. The predictions from this method have been experimentally assessed and shows good enrichment in identifying active small molecules. The above specified method depends on global structural similarity and is not capable of a priori selecting a particular ligand‚Äêbinding site in the protein of interest. Further, since the methods rely on 2D similarity assessment for ligands, they are not capable of recognizing stereochemical similarity of small-molecules that are substantially different but demonstrate geometric shape similarity. To address these concerns, a new pocket centric approach, PoLi, capable of targeting specific binding pockets in holo‚Äêprotein templates, was developed and experimentally assessed.  Computing Infrastructure  The computation of pair-wise interactions between atoms, which is a prerequisite for the operation of many virtual screening programs, is of O(N^{2}) computational complexity, where N is the number of atoms in the system. Because of the quadratic scaling with respect to the number of atoms, the computing infrastructure may vary from a laptop computer for a ligand- based method to a mainframe for a structure-based method. = Ligand-based = Ligand-based methods typically require a fraction of a second for a single structure comparison operation. A single CPU is enough to perform a large screening within hours. However, several comparisons can be made in parallel in order to expedite the processing of a large database of compounds. = Structure-based = The size of the task requires a parallel computing infrastructure, such as a cluster of Linux systems, running a batch queue processor to handle the work, such as Sun Grid Engine or Torque PBS. A means of handling the input from large compound libraries is needed. This requires a form of compound database that can be queried by the parallel cluster, delivering compounds in parallel to the various compute nodes. Commercial database engines may be too ponderous, and a high speed indexing engine, such as Berkeley DB, may be a better choice. Furthermore, it may not be efficient to run one comparison per job, because the ramp up time of the cluster nodes could easily outstrip the amount of useful work. To work around this, it is necessary to process batches of compounds in each cluster job, aggregating the results into some kind of log file. A secondary process, to mine the log files and extract high scoring candidates, can then be run after the whole experiment has been run.  Accuracy  The aim of virtual screening is to identify molecules of novel chemical structure that bind to the macromolecular target of interest. Thus, success of a virtual screen is defined in terms of finding interesting new scaffolds rather than the total number of hits. Interpretations of virtual screening accuracy should, therefore, be considered with caution. Low hit rates of interesting scaffolds are clearly preferable over high hit rates of already known scaffolds. Most tests of virtual screening studies in the literature are retrospective. In these studies, the performance of a VS technique is measured by its ability to retrieve a small set of previously known molecules with affinity to the target of interest (active molecules or just actives) from a library containing a much higher proportion of assumed inactives or decoys. By contrast, in prospective applications of virtual screening, the resulting hits are subjected to experimental confirmation (e.g., IC50 measurements). There is consensus that retrospective benchmarks are not good predictors of prospective performance and consequently only prospective studies constitute conclusive proof of the suitability of a technique for a particular target.  Application to drug discovery  Virtual screening is a very useful application when it comes to identifying hit molecules as a beginning for medicinal chemistry. As the virtual screening approach begins to become a more vital and substantial technique within the medicinal chemistry industry the approach has had an expeditious increase.  Ligand-based methods  While not knowing the structure trying to predict how the ligands will bind to the receptor. With the use of pharmacophore features each ligand identified donor, and acceptors. Equating features are overlaid, however given it is unlikely there is a single correct solution. = Pharmacophore models = This technique is used when merging the results of searches by using unlike reference compounds, same descriptors and coefficient, but different active compounds. This technique is beneficial because it is more efficient than just using a single reference structure along with the most accurate performance when it comes to diverse actives. Pharmacophore is an ensemble of steric and electronic features that are needed to have an optimal supramolecular interaction or interactions with a biological target structure in order to precipitate its biological response. Choose a representative as a set of actives, most methods will look for similar bindings. It is preferred to have multiple rigid molecules and the ligands should be diversified, in other words ensure to have different features that don't occur during the binding phase.  Structure  Build a compound predictive model based on known active and known inactive knowledge. QSAR's (Quantitative-Structure Activity Relationship) which is restricted to a small homogenous dataset. SAR's (Structure Activity Relationship) where data is treated qualitatively and can be used with structural classes and more than one binding mode. Models prioritize compounds for lead discovery.  Machine Learning  In order to use Machine Learning for this model of Virtual Screening there must be a training set with known active and known inactive compounds. There also is a model of activity that then is computed by way of substructural analysis, recursive partitioning, support vector machines, k nearest neighbors and neural networks. The final step is finding the probability that a compound is active and then ranking each compound based on its probability of being active. = Substructural analysis in Machine Learning = The first Machine Learning model used on large datasets is the Substructure Analysis that was created in 1973. Each fragment substructure make a continuous contribution an activity of specific type. Substructure is a method that overcomes the difficulty of massive dimensionality when it comes to analyzing structures in drug design. An efficient substructure analysis is used for structures that have similarities to a multi-level building or tower. Geometry is used for numbering boundary joints for a given structure in the onset and towards the climax. When the method of special static condensation and substitutions routines are developed this method is proved to be more productive than the previous substructure analysis models. = Recursive partitioning = Recursively partitioning is method that creates a decision tree using qualitative data. Understanding the way rules break classes up with a low error of misclassification while repeating each step until no sensible splits can be found. However, recursive partitioning can have poor prediction ability potentially creating fine models at the same rate.  Structure-based methods known protein ligand docking  Ligand can bind into an active site within a protein by using a docking search algorithm, and scoring function in order to identify the most likely cause for an individual ligand while assigning a priority order.

Village in the former Caledon district, 93 km southeast of Cape Town. It takes its name from the Bot River on the west bank of which it is situated. The form Botrivier is preferred for official use. History Long before Western settlement, this east-facing glen was home to prosperous herders, the Khoi-Khoi, who pastured their livestock in rich pastures along the banks of the ‚ÄúCouga River‚Äù. The river flows south towards the marsh Botrivier estuary, and was for centuries the home of contented tribes who savoured the privilege of fresh waters in the water-scarce Cape. ‚ÄúRich in fat‚Äù, was the river‚Äôs name ‚Äì a tribute to the area‚Äôs reputation for ‚Äúlots of butter‚Äù, which the early settlers came in search of to barter for. It was this creamy ‚Äúbotter‚Äù (Afrikaans) which gave the ‚ÄúBot River‚Äù its ultimate name. Later, the hamlet was to become an 18th- century outpost for the Dutch East India Company at Compagnes Drift farm in Botrivier, now home to Beaumont Wines, where the owners have cherished and protected its early heritage. At the same time that a company of soldiers was stationed at the drift at Bot River to monitor who crossed the Cape frontier, Compagnes Drift also developed as a loan farm. Loan farms were owned by the Dutch East India Company. Under this scheme, burghers could rent the land, farm it and profit from it, but they could not own it. As Napoleon extended his control over Europe, including Holland, the British sought to pre-empt possible French control of the Cape. In January 1806 British forces defeated the Dutch at the battle of Blouberg. Among the handful of Dutch burghers who rendered loyal service in the battle was Servaas Daniel de Kock. As a reward for his service, the Dutch East India Company gave him ownership of the farm he had worked on loan. De Kock planted wheat, vines, fruit trees, vegetables and turmeric‚Äîa spice that was in high demand in the curry-loving kitchens of the Cape of Good Hope. A major event in the life of Botrivier was the arrival of the railway line from Cape Town to Caledon in 1902. In much the same way as the American railway teams forged west in the USA, the Cape tracks were forged through the Hottentots-Holland mountain range above Somerset West ‚Äì a great engineering feat - and this brought the village of Bot River to its feet when the first trains ran in 1912, allowing villagers, farmers and traders to journey to the Mother City of Cape Town faster than ever before. And the traffic grew from the City into the countryside too.

He has since transitioned into a role of partner, father and coach. Rugby career =Toulouse / France= He played his first Heineken Cup match during the 2000‚Äì01 tournament, against Welsh side, the Cardiff Blues. He scored his first Heineken Cup try coming off the bench in a match against the Saracens, and did the same in the subsequent match against the Cardiff Blues. Toulouse won the Top 14 in 2001, defeating ASM Clermont Auvergne 34 to 22 in the final at Stade de France. Poitrenaud made his debut for France during 2001, and was part of the French side which defeated the Springboks 20 to 10 in Paris. He earned a further two international caps for France that year, playing in the subsequent victories over Australia in Marseille and Fiji in Saint-√âtienne. Toulouse made it to the final of the 2002-03 Heineken Cup, and defeated USA Perpignan to win the cup. Toulouse were also finalists of the domestic competition, but were defeated by Stade Fran√ßais. Poitrenaud returned to the national side in early 2003, to play in all of France's matches during the 2003 Six Nations Championship, which included losses to England and Ireland, with wins over Wales, Italy and Scotland. In the lead up to the Rugby World Cup he appeared in three matches for France; in the losses to Argentina, the All Blacks and England. He was called up to the French squad for the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia. He played in the 51‚Äì29 victory over Japan as well as the 41‚Äì14 in over the United States during the pool stages. France played the All Blacks in the third place match. He played in the 24 to 21 win over England in Paris. France would eventually win the 2004 Six Nations Championship. Toulouse made it to the final of the 2003-04 Heineken Cup, but were defeated by the London Wasps in the final. The scores were tied going into the last minute when Wasps player Robert Howley kicked the ball to the corner; Poitrenaud stood over the ball waiting for it to bounce into touch but it stayed in play and Howley chased the ball down and touched it down for the winning try . Poitrenaud played another four times for France later that year; playing in matches against the United States, Canada, Argentina and the All Blacks. Toulouse were finalists of the 2004-05 Heineken Cup, and met fellow French club Stade Fran√ßais (who defeated Toulouse in the domestic final of 2003). Stade Toulousain won the match 18 points to 12. He did not play any tests during 2005, or during the 2006 Six Nations Championship, but played in the wins over Romania and the Springboks in June 2006. Poitrenaud sustained a broken ankle during a match between Toulouse and Perpignan on Saturday 16 February. He is expected to be sidelined for at least three months with this injury and as a result will miss out on France's remaining matches in the Six Nations championship. This came only a few days after he was recalled to the French national team by Marc Lievremont.

He organised a small circle of like-minded men of police and even professional backgrounds into a self-sufficient gang that carried out at least one multimillion-dollar robbery, and the initial stage of a bizarre extortion plot that echoed a notorious and still-unsolved series of multiple robbery-homicides. A lifelong gun fanatic, he repeatedly retained and then was caught with illegal weapons that implicated him, with his final downfall coming when he shot dead the head of a family of diamond merchants that he and his partner apparently tried to rob. Although he always denied any involvement and passed a polygraph, Bouhouche became the subject of enduring suspicions about what he might have been able to reveal about mass shootings by the still unidentified Brabant killers. Life and criminal activities Madani \\"Dany\\" Bouhouche was born in Brussels, son of an Algerian father and Belgian mother. His views have been described as neo Nazi despite his parentage. He started his police career with the Bijzondere Opsporings Brigade (BOB), a detective branch of the Rijkswacht/Gendarmerie in a fragmented law enforcement system Belgium then had. Soon after joining the BOB, Bouhouche developed illegal activities with a few gendarmes of the BOB and others, most of whom ended up dismissed, imprisoned, fugitive or murdered after being inveigled into helping him. 22 Apr 1999 New Times Broward-Palm Beach, Secrets and Crimes\\"Secrets Untold\\". Expatica.com. July 22, 2006. In 1981 he was caught trying to electronically surveil another unit and reassigned to regular duty, the same year he committed burglary of Group Diane in Etterbeek, stealing firearms including machine guns. Also in 1981 the superior officer who insisted on the disciplining of Bouhouche was almost killed in a machine gun attack that happened within days of another investigator suspicious of Bouhouche being the target of a car bomb. Both attempted multiple murders were linked to Bouhouche and associates (by the provenance of an automatic rifle and remote control component respectively). By this time under a cloud, he quit the Gendarmerie along with an accomplice, Robert Beijer, eventually setting up a private detective bureau Agence de Recherches et d'Informations, before Bouhouche left and bought a gun shop. A small framed man who often wore sunglasses, Bouhouche enjoyed hobbies such as mountaineering and skydiving, however his lifelong obsession was shooting and he participated in private paramilitary training with Far Right acquaintances, these included fellow members of Westland New Post, an organisation given close attention by the Brabant killers investigation for reasons independent of his involvement with it.Brabant killings: between hopes and doubts Fr√©d√©ric Loore  Published onOctober 24, 2017  UpdatedFebruary 21, 2019 Vague circumstantial links abound between Bouhouche's gang and the Brabant killers, they included the taking of risks to steal firearms rather than money; firearms stolen, used or seen carried in the killings being types he was known to have either bought (MAC10) or stolen (heavy buckshot riot guns, MP5 submachine guns), and those very same type weapons being found neither in the Brabant killer gangs' river dump of their guns or in Bouhouche's secret arms cache of guns stolen from Group Diane. Moreover, the method of anonymising firearms and manufacturing false car number plates were reportedly identical; the areas chosen for clandestine disposal sometimes overlapped, both stored stolen cars for long periods, etc. However, even when taken together, the pattern of similarities are inconclusive, as such a large scale investigation would be expected to reveal coincidental parallels between armed gangs of the same era. A forged number plate found on a stolen car used by the Brabant gang and reportedly showing signs of being made by the same set of equipment as Bouhouche's might have amounted to more tangible evidence of a connection, but like a number of other evidentiary items it was lost before being properly examined. Arrests and trials He was first arrested in January 1986 on suspicion of murdering his acquaintance Juan Mendez, a FN weapons engineer, whose firearms collection Bouhouche had stolen. Through being in the deceased man's home with his family when police arrived he came under suspicion. Bouhouche used hollow point ammunition years before during an incident when he opened fire in the line of duty, Furthermore, a pistol (concealed in frozen spaghetti sauce) was found in his home that was the same type and thought ballistically identical to the Mendez murder weapon. However the evidence was challenged and Bouhouche was released in November 1988. The next year, Bouhouche fled the country, sought after a diamond dealer in Antwerp was murdered in what Bouhouche said was a factored debt collection that got out of hand, but was suspected to be a botched robbery. He was brought back to Belgium, convicted of the murder, and of murdering a security guard who had disappeared along with a consignment of gold in 1982. Bouhouche was acquitted on the charge of attempting to murder his superior in 1981. Another man was convicted as a fugitive for the gold robbery murder, but was acquitted at a retrial when finally caught. The trial was one of the longest in Belgian history, and greatly embarrassed the Belgian Gendarmerie or Rijkswacht and politicians responsible for it. Public reaction Suspicion over Bouhouche having been involved in the still unsolved 28 murders committed 1982-85 by the mysterious Brabant killers grew as details emerged of his psychopathic behavior and bizarre schemes. The most remarkable revelation was that Bouhouche had been leader of a complex extortion plot for blowing up gas mains just outside the shops of a supermarket chain (the Brabant killers' massacres had mainly been of shoppers in a chain of just such stores). Bouhouche had thought it up in the late seventies and involved several friends in concrete pre-preparations, which progressed to the construction of a secret escape tunnel from a building where the ransom payment was to be made. Another connection was that Mendez became so concerned that guns had passed through his hands and then been used in the Brabant killers crimes, that he had repeatedly contacted police for reassurance. Bouhouche's physical size and facial features not fitting any description compiled from early unmasked encounters with the three main (possibly only) members of the Brabant killers gang weighs against his active participation, especially in 1985. Post-parole life and death On September 15, 2000, Bouhouche was freed on parole, with the authorities (embarrassed the previous year by failing to track down a fugitive associate living openly in Florida) seemingly having little interest in pressuring him for information. He moved to the French Pyrenees, isolated near the small city of Fougax-et-Barrineuf, and living quietly in a modest hilltop home with virtually no modern amenities.

Fictionalized autobiographical novels, written in the 3rd-person, account for most of his creative work. His academic writing encompasses reviews, essays, articles, and books on semiotics, film, dance, theater, and opera. His non-traditional films reveal an engineered penchant for melodrama, love songs, and silent movies; their central topic is homosexuality. Towards the end of the 2000s, he started organizing concerts en images, events in which he combines silent films, some segments shot by himself for the occasions, with live classical music, and sometimes singing and acting.  Biography  Eric de Kuyper was born and spent his early childhood in Brussels and then, as he put it, his teenage years of choices swayed by \\"faith, sexuality, and the future\\" in Antwerp. According to him, his family mostly spoke Dutch while they \\"thought in French and felt the more subtle emotions\\" in that language. After graduating from Notre Dame Jesuit High School, he returned to the city of his birth to study in the Department of Audiovisual and Dramatic Arts and Techniques (Rits), Erasmus University College Brussels, and took courses in philosophy and mass communication at the Free University of Brussels. While in college, he began to work as a producer at the Flemish Radio and Television Network. In 1974 he registered for graduate study at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences in Paris where he worked in semiotics and from which he received a PhD for his thesis \\"Pour une S√©miotique Spectaculaire\\" under the direction of A. J. Greimas in 1979. Before he became a full-time writer in 1992, he was professor of film theory at the Catholic University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands (1978‚Äì1988), and then Deputy Director of the Dutch Film Museum (1988‚Äì1992). He was on the editorial board of and contributed to the Dutch academic film journal Versus. De Kuyper has described himself as belonging to the dying breed of inhabitants of Brussels who are fully bilingual in Dutch (Flemish) and French, he also speaks English and German. His most frequent coauthor of academic papers and teammate in filmmaking has been another Flemish Belgian and de Kuyper's fellow student at Brussels and Paris, Emile Poppe, later a colleague at Nijmegen University (Poppe's position with the Film Archives eventually associated him with the University of Groningen). They live near Nijmegen in Kranenburg in Germany, about from the Dutch border, as does the main character of de Kuyper's short story \\"De verkeerde krant,\\" (\\"The Wrong Newspaper\\"). De Kuyper has said that he feels at home both in Belgium and the Netherlands to a certain degree, as well as somewhat of a stranger in each of the countries.  Fiction  = By the Sea (1988) = De Kuyper's first novel (Aan zee: taferelen uit de kinderjaren; By the Sea: Scenes from a Childhood) consists of a series of insightful snapshots of a small boy's life in post-World War II Brussels and family summer vacation at Ostend.Ostend beach without thinking of de Kuyper.\\" Together, they conjure up a nostalgic vignette of times gone by, along with a timeless sense of childhood when one feels everything revolves around him. A reviewer said of its effective acuteness that no one who has read it can look at the Belgian beach without thinking of de Kuyper. The lyrical By the Sea turned out to be the first volume in de Kuyper's successful series of 3rd-person fictionalized memoirs. = \\"The Wrong Newspaper\\" (2008) = In the short story (De verkeerde krant), de Kuyper turns his observations to all things German as a Dutch professor, living in Germany like de Kuyper, takes a train trip to Frankfurt: > The ticket inspector came. Ich bedanke mich, he said politely. Strange that > in German you thank yourself. For a long time he had pondered why the custom > differed so much from that of other languages. In French, English, and Dutch > you thank the other person and not yourself. Ultimately, he reached the > conclusion that it wasn't so much a direct expression of thanks as a form of > courtesy in which I declare myself to be thankful. Of course, you could > always just say Danke sch√∂n. The traveler's thoughts drift from languages to comparisons of European newspaper styles to cross-cultural observations, while his journey brings him to an unusual chance encounter as he transfers to a connecting train at Cologne.  Film  De Kuyper's films reveal an engineered penchant for melodrama, love songs, and silent films of Alfred Machin and Yevgeni Bauer. The central theme of his filmmaking is homosexuality. Most of his work is highly experimental underground shown mainly at film festivals. = Casta Diva (1983) = His non-traditional directorial debut (finished 1982, released 1983) earned him the Grand Prix at the Hy√®res International Festival of Young Cinema, Different Cinema. Its original Italian title refers to the aria \\"Oh, pure/chaste goddess...\\" (i.e., the moon) from Norma. The black-and-white 106'-long feature without a dialogue starts with a stationary camera showing attractive men grooming in front of a mirror while the soundtrack of operatic arias and fragments of other songs challenges the viewer to perceive the two levels as seductive and intoxicating parallels, speculative contrasts, or mold-breaking transgressions. The film establishes a relation with its cinematic objects, male bodies, that is both sensual and distant, somewhat reminiscent of Flesh (dir. Paul Morrissey; 1968) produced by Andy Warhol. = A Strange Love Affair (1984) = In his most narrative film, de Kuyper explores the themes of melodrama in the context of the characters' selection of lovers, and drives it in with an unconventional ending. The black-and-white photography is by the legendary Henri Alekan, cinematographer on Beauty and the Beast (dir. Jean Cocteau, 1946). The love story between a college student and his 40-year-old professor of film studies (like de Kuyper at the time), specialized in Hollywood dramas, takes an unusual twist when the two decide to visit the student's parents. The father turns out to be the professor's lover of fifteen years ago. De Kuyper said he considered it important not to allow the audience to read the film through the common expectations of a gay topic, while at the same time, the choice of two male lead characters prevented the deciphering of the topic of love through the commonly established codes. He intended the balance to bring to the foreground the film's central topic, the exploration of asynchrony at the roots of the Western notion of love. Rather than a discourse about love in people's real lives, though, A Strange Love Affair is filled with discourse about love as found in the movies, particularly Johnny Guitar (dir. Nicholas Ray, 1954), the controlling metaphor for the whole story. After a decade-long hiatus from film, de Kuyper collaborated with Chantal Akerman on the screenplays for her La captive (The Captive; 2000) and Demain on d√©m√©nage (Tomorrow We Move; 2004) and she later cast him in a supporting role in her Die Blutgr√§fin.

The equation for an s-particle distribution function (probability density function) in the BBGKY hierarchy includes the (s + 1)-particle distribution function, thus forming a coupled chain of equations. This formal theoretic result is named after Nikolay Bogolyubov, Max Born, Herbert S. Green, John Gamble Kirkwood, and Jacques Yvon. Formulation The evolution of an N-particle system in absence of quantum fluctuations is given by the Liouville equation for the probability density function f_N = f_N(\\\\mathbf{q}_1 \\\\dots \\\\mathbf{q}_N, \\\\mathbf{p}_1 \\\\dots \\\\mathbf{p}_N, t) in 6N-dimensional phase space (3 space and 3 momentum coordinates per particle) : \\\\frac{\\\\partial f_N}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{p}_i}{m} \\\\frac{\\\\partial f_N}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{q}_i} + \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\mathbf{F}_i \\\\frac{\\\\partial f_N}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{p}_i} = 0, where \\\\mathbf{q}_i, \\\\mathbf{p}_i are the coordinates and momentum for i-th particle with mass m, and the net force acting on the i-th particle is : \\\\mathbf{F}_i = -\\\\sum_{j=1 eq i}^N \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi_{ij}}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{q}_i} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi_i^\\\\text{ext}}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{q}_i}, where \\\\Phi_{ij}(\\\\mathbf{q}_i, \\\\mathbf{q}_j) is the pair potential for interaction between particles, and \\\\Phi^\\\\text{ext}(\\\\mathbf{q}_i) is the external-field potential. By integration over part of the variables, the Liouville equation can be transformed into a chain of equations where the first equation connects the evolution of one-particle probability density function with the two-particle probability density function, second equation connects the two-particle probability density function with the three-particle probability density function, and generally the s-th equation connects the s-particle probability density function : f_s(\\\\mathbf{q}_1 \\\\dots \\\\mathbf{q}_s, \\\\mathbf{p}_1 \\\\dots \\\\mathbf{p}_s, t) = \\\\int f_N(\\\\mathbf{q}_1 \\\\dots \\\\mathbf{q}_N, \\\\mathbf{p}_1 \\\\dots \\\\mathbf{p}_N, t) \\\\,d\\\\mathbf{q}_{s+1} \\\\dots d\\\\mathbf{q}_N \\\\,d\\\\mathbf{p}_{s+1} \\\\dots d\\\\mathbf{p}_N with the (s + 1)-particle probability density function: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial f_s}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\sum_{i=1}^s \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{p}_i}{m} \\\\frac{\\\\partial f_s}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{q}_i} - \\\\sum_{i=1}^s \\\\left( \\\\sum_{j=1 eq i}^s \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi_{ij}}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{q}_i} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi_i^{ext}}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{q}_i} \\\\right) \\\\frac{\\\\partial f_s}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{p}_i} = (N-s) \\\\sum_{i=1}^s \\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi_{i\\\\,s+1}}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{q}_i} \\\\frac{\\\\partial f_{s+1}}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{p}_i} \\\\,d\\\\mathbf{q}_{s+1} \\\\,d\\\\mathbf{p}_{s+1}. The equation above for s-particle distribution function is obtained by integration of the Liouville equation over the variables \\\\mathbf{q}_{s+1} \\\\dots \\\\mathbf{q}_N, \\\\mathbf{p}_{s+1} \\\\dots \\\\mathbf{p}_N. The problem with the above equation is that it is not closed. To solve f_s, one has to know f_{s+1}, which in turn demands to solve f_{s+2} and all the way back to the full Liouville equation. However, one can solve f_s, if f_{s+1} could be modeled. One such case is the Boltzmann equation for f_1(\\\\mathbf{q}_1, \\\\mathbf{p}_1, t), where f_2(\\\\mathbf{q}_1, \\\\mathbf{q}_2, \\\\mathbf{p}_1, \\\\mathbf{p}_2, t) is modeled based on the molecular chaos hypothesis (). In fact, in the Boltzmann equation f_2 = f_2(\\\\mathbf{p}_1, \\\\mathbf{p_2}, t) is the collision integral. This limiting process of obtaining Boltzmann equation from Liouville equation is known as Boltzmann‚ÄìGrad limit.Harold Grad (1949). On the kinetic theory of rarefied gases. Communications on pure and applied mathematics, 2(4), 331‚Äì407. Physical interpretation and applications Schematically, the Liouville equation gives us the time evolution for the whole N-particle system in the form Df_N=0, which expresses an incompressible flow of the probability density in phase space. We then define the reduced distribution functions incrementally by integrating out another particle's degrees of freedom f_s \\\\sim \\\\int f_{s+1}. An equation in the BBGKY hierarchy tells us that the time evolution for such a f_s is consequently given by a Liouville-like equation, but with a correction term that represents force-influence of the N-s suppressed particles :D f_s \\\\propto \\\\text{div}_{\\\\mathbf p} \\\\langle \\\\text{grad}_{\\\\mathbf q}\\\\Phi_{i,s+1}\\\\rangle_{f_{s+1}}. The problem of solving the BBGKY hierarchy of equations is as hard as solving the original Liouville equation, but approximations for the BBGKY hierarchy (which allow truncation of the chain into a finite system of equations) can readily be made. The merit of these equations is that the higher distribution functions f_{s+2},f_{s+3},\\\\dots affect the time evolution of f_s only implicitly via f_{s+1}. Truncation of the BBGKY chain is a common starting point for many applications of kinetic theory that can be used for derivation of classical or quantum kinetic equations. In particular, truncation at the first equation or the first two equations can be used to derive classical and quantum Boltzmann equations and the first order corrections to the Boltzmann equations. Other approximations, such as the assumption that the density probability function depends only on the relative distance between the particles or the assumption of the hydrodynamic regime, can also render the BBGKY chain accessible to solution.Harris, S. (2004). An introduction to the theory of the Boltzmann equation. Courier Corporation. Bibliography s-particle distribution functions were introduced in classical statistical mechanics by J. Yvon in 1935.J. Yvon (1935): La th√©orie statistique des fluides et l'√©quation d'√©tat (in French), Actual. Sci. & Indust. ‚Ññ 203 (Paris, Hermann). The BBGKY hierarchy of equations for s-particle distribution functions was written out and applied to the derivation of kinetic equations by Bogoliubov in the article received on July 1945 and published in 1946 in Russian and in English.

Plot In the summer of 1967, Marshall Stouffer is chased in Fort Smith, Arkansas, by his two older brothers, Mark and Marty; the brothers love using Marshall to film him in stunts, which he dislikes. Occasionally Marty and Mark will show footage of their antics in their garage to all their friends. Marshall repeatedly and secretly gets even with his brothers by pulling revenge pranks of his own, like cleaning the toilet with his brothers' toothbrushes and filling their canteens with downstream river water into which they had been urinating. Mark and Marty have a dream of filming dangerous animals around the country, and the dream starts when they find a rare, special camera in a shop where they have their films developed. Despite their father Marty Sr.'s insistence that they cannot afford the camera, he relents after their mother, Agnes, says she will give them her \\"vacation\\" money that she has been saving for several years. Marty and Mark purchase the camera & begin planning their trip. Their father is against this idea. The three brothers start camping. First, they miss a shot at catching an eagle, then go to film some alligators, and start by seeing a man who was attacked by an alligator. As they go in a swamp on a boat, Mark throws some bait but it lands in the trees, trying to retrieve it, his clothing gets stuck in a branch underwater and he starts to drown, Marshall and Marty drive the boat in attempts to save him, but it crashes into another branch, which sends Marshall flying into the water. Marshall gets a knife from Marty and cuts Mark loose, but Marshall is now dealing with a bigger problem; he and the alligator are face to face. Marshall is able to get back on the boat in time. When they get back to the hut, the alligator man (Strango) tells them about how back when he served in the Korean War he befriended a fellow soldier named Phil. Strango and Phil would exchange stories about their wilderness adventures. Strango would talk about hunting alligators and Phil would tell tall tales about bears. This rouses Marty's attention and he asks about it. Strango states that Phil was talking about a cave full of hundreds of bears somewhere \\"Out West.\\" They drive northwest until they reach Devil's Playground in Colorado, \\"the last home of the wild American wolf.\\" Devil's Playground is located on government protected land. They catch footage of a wolf creeping up on a doe. Then as the wolf is about to ambush the doe there is a series of explosions. The brothers look up and see two F-4 Phantoms flying overhead. The pilots see the brothers and turn around, firing missiles at them eventually hitting a giant boulder knocking the three down. As they get up a herd of wild horses comes thundering towards them. They get in the truck just in time to film it. When the horses pass Marshall sees an owl that looks a lot like his owl Leona. The three follow it and discover a cave. On the wall of the cave is an ancient Indian drawing of a cave filled with bear-shaped figures. Marty and Mark draw it on Marshall's chest and show it to an old Native American woman. The woman tells them that it's located near Arapaho Peak in Montana. After a strange man (Danny Glover) saves Marshall after going down the stream, he tells the brothers about the cave where it is too. During the journey, they meet a woman whose husband was killed by bears, when returning to their van, they discovered they been robbed, but they still got the film, Mark breaks his leg after getting into a fight with Marty. Despite his injury, they continued finding the Bear Cave, they discovered it and begin filming while the bears are asleep, but the bears wake up, luckily the brothers sing a song that puts them to sleep. However the bears wake up, after some Bat Guano lands on one of their lamps and they managed to escaped, not before grabbing the camera. Upon returning home, Marshall learns his Dad never flew the plane and things start going downhill when the brothers' father get injured and is in the hospital, causing the boys and their mother to do the work now. The next day Marshall flies the plane, but Leon (Tracey Walter) jumps in helps while flying it, after flying it, his father ends up being impressed for learning how to fly it. They display their film at the school gym, and everyone claps, but when their adversarial affiliate DC makes a rude comment, their dad begins to applaud, having the crowd cheer and clap. DC, who is always being a \\"devil's advocate\\" from the beginning, becomes the only one who wants his money back, which he gets from Marty Sr., but everyone else comments all of the brothers with compliments. Marshall and his Dad smile at each other.

The agitations involved several mass protests, riots, student and political movements in Tamil Nadu concerning the official status of Hindi in the state. The first anti-Hindi imposition agitation was launched in 1937, in opposition to the introduction of compulsory teaching of Hindi in the schools of Madras Presidency by the first Indian National Congress government led by C. Rajagopalachari (Rajaji). This move was immediately opposed by E. V. Ramasamy (Periyar) and the opposition Justice Party. The agitation, which lasted three years, was multifaceted and involved fasts, conferences, marches, picketing and protests. The government responded with a crackdown resulting in the deaths of two protesters and the arrests of 1,198 persons including women and children. Mandatory Hindi education was later withdrawn by the British Governor of Madras Lord Erskine in February 1940 after the resignation of the Congress Government in 1939. The adoption of an official language for the Indian Republic was a hotly debated issue during the framing of the Indian Constitution after India's independence from the United Kingdom. After an exhaustive and divisive debate, Hindi was adopted as the official language of India with English continuing as an associate official language for a period of fifteen years, after which Hindi would become the sole official language. The new Constitution came into effect on 26 January 1950. Efforts by the Indian Government to make Hindi the sole official language after 1965 were not acceptable to many non-Hindi Indian states, who wanted the continued use of English. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), a descendant of Dravidar Kazhagam, led the opposition to Hindi. To allay their fears, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru enacted the Official Languages Act in 1963 to ensure the continuing use of English beyond 1965. The text of the Act did not satisfy the DMK and increased their skepticism that his assurances might not be honoured by future administrations. As the day (26 January 1965) of switching over to Hindi as sole official language approached, the anti-Hindi movement gained momentum in Madras State with increased support from college students. On 25 January, a full-scale riot broke out in the southern city of Madurai, sparked off by a minor altercation between agitating students and Congress party members. The riots spread all over Madras State, continued unabated for the next two months, and were marked by acts of violence, arson, looting, police firing and lathi charges. The Congress Government of the Madras State, called in paramilitary forces to quell the agitation; their involvement resulted in the deaths of about seventy persons (by official estimates) including two policemen. To calm the situation, Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri gave assurances that English would continue to be used as the official language as long as the non-Hindi speaking states wanted. The riots subsided after Shastri's assurance, as did the student agitation. The agitations of 1965 led to major political changes in the state. The DMK won the 1967 assembly election and the Congress Party never managed to recapture power in the state since then. The Official Languages Act was eventually amended in 1967 by the Congress Government headed by Indira Gandhi to guarantee the indefinite use of Hindi and English as official languages. This effectively ensured the current \\"virtual indefinite policy of bilingualism\\" of the Indian Republic. There were also two similar (but smaller) agitations in 1968 and 1986 which had varying degrees of success. Background The Republic of India has hundreds of languages. During the British Raj, English was the official language. When the Indian Independence Movement gained momentum in the early part of the 20th century, efforts were undertaken to make Hindi as a common language to unite various linguistic groups against the British Government. As early as 1918, Mahatma Gandhi established the Dakshin Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha (Institution for the Propagation of Hindi in South India). In 1925, the Indian National Congress switched to Hindi from English for conducting its proceedings. Both Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru were supporters of Hindi and Congress wanted to propagate the learning of Hindi in non-Hindi speaking Provinces of India. The idea of making Hindi or Hindi the common language, was not acceptable to Periyar, who viewed it as an attempt to make Tamils subordinate to North Indians. Agitation of 1937‚Äì40 (From right to left) : B. R. Ambedkar, Periyar and Jinnah at Jinnah's residence in Bombay (8 January 1940) The Indian National Congress won the 1937 elections in Madras Presidency. Rajaji became the Chief Minister on 14 July 1937. He was a supporter of propagating Hindi in South India. On 11 August 1937, within a month of coming to power, he announced his intention to introduce Hindi language teaching in secondary schools by issuing a policy statement. On 21 April 1938, he issued a government order (G.O.) making the teaching of Hindi compulsory in 125 secondary schools in the Presidency. Periyar and the opposition Justice Party led by A. T. Panneerselvam immediately opposed the move. They started statewide protests against Rajaji and Hindi. The agitation was backed by Periyar's Self-Respect Movement and Justice Party. It also had the support of Tamil scholars like Maraimalai Adigal, Somasundara Bharathi, K. Appadurai, Mudiyarasan and Ilakkuvanar. In December 1937, Tamil Saivite scholars were among the first to announce their opposition to the Hindi teaching in the Saiva Sidhandha Maha Samaja conference at Velur. Women also participated in the agitation in large numbers. Moovalur Ramamirtham, Narayani, Va. Ba. Thamaraikani, Munnagar Azhagiyar, Dr. S. Dharmambal, Malar Mugathammaiyar, Pattammal and Seethammal were some of the women who were arrested for participating in the agitation. On 13 November 1938, the Tamil Nadu Women's Conference was convened to demonstrate women's support for the movement. The agitation was marked by anti-Brahmin sentiments as the protesters believed Brahmins were attempting to impose Hindi and Sanskrit over Tamil. Despite the general anti-Brahminism of the agitation, a few Brahmins like Kanchi Rajagopalachari also participated in the movement. The Tamil speaking Muslims in the Madras presidency supported the agitation (in contrast to the Urdu speaking Muslims, who supported the propagation of Hindi). The agitation was marked by fasts, protest marches, processions, picketing of schools teaching Hindi and government offices, anti-Hindi conferences, observing an anti-Hindi day (1 July and 3 December 1938) and black flag demonstrations. It was active in the Tamil speaking districts of the Presidency ‚Äì Ramnad, Tirunelveli, Salem, Tanjore and North Arcot. During the course of the agitation, two protesters -Natarajan and Thalamuthu ‚Äì lost their lives in police custody. Front page of Periyar E. V. Ramasamy's periodical Kudiyarasu (3 September 1939). The headline reads \\"Veezhga Indhi\\" (Down with Hindi) The ruling Congress Party was divided on the Hindi issue. While Rajaji and his supporters stuck to their position, Sathyamurti and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan were against it. They wanted Rajaji to make Hindi optional or to provide a conscience clause for allowing parents to withhold their children from Hindi Classes. But Rajaji was firm in his stance. The police response to the agitation grew progressively brutal in 1939. During the agitation, a total of 1,198 protesters were arrested and out of them 1,179 were convicted (73 of those jailed were women and 32 children accompanied their mothers to prison). Periyar was fined 1,000 Rupees and sentenced to one year of rigorous imprisonment for inciting \\"women to disobey the law\\" (he was released within six months on 22 May 1939 citing medical grounds) and Annadurai was jailed for four months. On 7 June 1939, all those arrested for participating in the agitations were released without explanation. Rajaji also organised pro-Hindi meetings to counter the agitators. On 29 October 1939, the Congress government resigned protesting the involvement of India in the Second World War, and the Madras provincial government was placed under Governor's rule. On 31 October, Periyar suspended the agitation and asked the Governor to withdraw the compulsory Hindi order. On 21 February 1940, Governor Erskine issued a press communique withdrawing compulsory Hindi teaching and making it optional. Agitations of 1946‚Äì50 During 1946‚Äì50, there were sporadic agitations against Hindi by the Dravidar Kazhagam (DK) and Periyar. Whenever the government introduced Hindi as a compulsory language in schools, anti-Hindi protests happened and succeeded in stopping the move. The largest anti-Hindi imposition agitations in this period occurred in 1948‚Äì50. After India obtained independence in 1947, the Congress Government at the Centre urged all states to make Hindi compulsory in schools. The Congress Government of Madras Presidency under Omandur Ramasamy Reddiar complied and made Hindi compulsory from the academic year 1948‚Äì49. It also introduced a minimum mark qualification in Hindi for the promotion of students to higher classes. Periyar once again launched an anti-Hindi imposition agitation. The 1948 agitation was supported by former Congress nationalists like M. P. Sivagnanam and Thiru. Vi. Ka, who recanted their earlier pro-Hindi policies. On 17 July, the DK convened an all party anti-Hindi conference to oppose the compulsory Hindi teaching. As in the agitation of 1938‚Äì40, this agitation was also characterized by strikes, black flag demonstrations and anti-Hindi processions. When Rajaji (then the Governor-General of India) visited Madras on 23 August, the DK staged a black flag demonstration protesting against his visit. On 27 August, Periyar and Annadurai were arrested. The Government did not change its position on Hindi and the agitation continued. On 18 December, Periyar and other DK leaders were arrested again. A compromise was reached between the government and agitators. The government stopped the legal action against the agitators and they in turn dropped the agitation on 26 December 1948. Eventually, the government made Hindi teaching optional from the academic year 1950‚Äì51. Students who did not want to learn Hindi were allowed to participate in other school activities during Hindi classes.  Official languages and the Indian Constitution  The Indian Constituent Assembly was established on 9 December 1946, for drafting a Constitution when India became independent. The Constituent Assembly witnessed fierce debates on the language issue. The adoption of a National Language, the language in which the Constitution was to be written in and the language in which the proceedings of the Constituent Assembly were to be conducted were the main linguistic questions debated by the framers of the Constitution. On one side were members from the \\"Hindi-speaking provinces\\" like Algu Rai Sastri, R.V. Dhulekar, Balkrishna Sharma, Purushottam Das Tandon, (all from United Provinces), Babunath Gupta (Bihar), Hari Vinayak Pataskar (Bombay) and Ravi Shankar Shukla, Seth Govind Das (Central Provinces and Berar). They moved a large number of pro-Hindi amendments and argued for adopting Hindi as the sole National Language. On 10 December 1946, Dhulekar declared \\"People who do not know Hindi have no right to stay in India. People who are present in the House to fashion a constitution for India and do not know Hindi are not worthy to be members of this assembly. They had better leave.\\"Constitution Assembly Debates-Official Report (New Delhi: Lok Sabha Secretariat, 1988), Volume 1, p 26-27 The members of the Constituent Assembly in favor of recognizing Hindi as the National Language of India was further divided into two camps: the Hindi faction comprising Tandon, Ravi Shankar Shukla, Govind Das, Sampurnanand, and K. M. Munshi; and the Hindi faction represented by Jawaharlal Nehru and Abul Kalam Azad. The adoption of Hindi as the national language was opposed by certain Constituent Assembly members from South India like T.T. Krishnamachari, G. Durgabai, T. A. Ramalingam Chettiar, N. G. Ranga, N. Gopalaswamy Ayyangar (all belonging to \\"Madras\\") and S. V. Krishnamurthy Rao (Mysore). This anti-Hindi block favoured \\"retaining\\" English as the \\"official\\" language. Their views were reflected in the following pronouncement of Krishnamachari: > We disliked the English language in the past. I disliked it because I was > forced to learn Shakespeare and Milton, for which I had no taste at all. If > we are going to be compelled to learn Hindi, I would perhaps not be able to > learn it because of my age, and perhaps I would not be willing to do it > because of the amount of constraint you put on me. This kind of intolerance > makes us fear that the strong Centre which we need, a strong Centre which is > necessary will also mean the enslavement of people who do not speak the > language at the centre. I would, Sir, convey a warning on behalf of people > of the South for the reason that there are already elements in South India > who want separation..., and my honourable friends in U.P. do not help us in > any way by flogging their idea of \\"Hindi Imperialism\\" to the maximum extent > possible. So, it is up to my friends in Uttar Pradesh to have a whole India; > it is up to them to have a Hindi-India. The choice is theirs.Constitution > Assembly Debates-Official Report (New Delhi: Lok Sabha Secretariat, 1988), > Volume 7, p235 After three years of debate, the assembly arrived at a compromise at the end of 1949. It was called the Munshi-Ayyangar formula (after K.M. Munshi and Gopalaswamy Ayyangar) and it struck a balance between the demands of all groups. Part XVII of the Indian Constitution was drafted according to this compromise. It did not have any mention of a \\"National Language\\". Instead, it defined only the \\"Official Languages\\" of the Union: Hindi in Devanagari script would be the official language of the Indian Union. For fifteen years, English would also be used for all official purposes (Article 343). A language commission could be convened after five years to recommend ways to promote Hindi as the sole official language and to phase out the use of English (Article 344). Official communication between states and between states and the Union would be in the official language of the union (Article 345). English would be used for all legal purposes ‚Äì in court proceedings, bills, laws, rules and other regulations (Article 348). The Union was duty bound to promote the spread and usage of Hindi (Article 351). India became independent on 15 August 1947 and the Constitution was adopted on 26 January 1950. The language commission The adoption of English as official language along with Hindi was heavily criticized by pro-Hindi politicians like Jana Sangh's founder Syama Prasad Mookerjee, who demanded that Hindi should be made National language. Soon after the Constitution was adopted on 26 January 1950, efforts were made to propagate Hindi for official usage. In 1952, the Ministry of Education launched a voluntary Hindi teaching scheme. On 27 May 1952, use of Hindi was introduced in warrants for judicial appointments. In 1955, in- house Hindi training was started for all ministries and departments of the central government. On 3 December 1955, the government started using Hindi (along with English) for \\"specific purposes of the Union\\". As provided for by Article 343, Nehru appointed the First Official Language Commission under the chairmanship of B. G. Kher on 7 June 1955. The commission delivered its report on 31 July 1956. It recommended a number of steps to eventually replace English with Hindi (the report registered \\"dissenting notes\\" from two members ‚Äì P. Subbarayan from Madras State and Suniti Kumar Chatterji from West Bengal. The Parliamentary Committee on Official Language, chaired by Govind Ballabh Pant was constituted in September 1957 to review the Kher commission report. After two years of deliberations, the Pant Committee submitted its recommendations to the President on 8 February 1959. It recommended that Hindi should be made the primary official language with English as the subsidiary one. The Kher Commission and the Pant Committee recommendations were condemned and opposed by self-described \\"non-Hindi\\" politicians like Frank Anthony and P. Subbarayan. The Academy of Telugu opposed the switch from English to Hindi in a convention held in 1956. Rajaji, once a staunch supporter of Hindi, organised an All India Language Conference (attended by representatives of Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu, Assamese, Oriya, Marathi, Kannada and Bengali languages) on 8 March 1958 to oppose the switch, declaring [that] \\"Hindi is as much foreign to non-Hindi speaking people as English is to the protagonists of Hindi.\\" As the opposition to Hindi grew stronger, Nehru tried to reassure the concerns of \\"non-Hindi speakers\\". Speaking in the parliamentary debate on a bill introduced by Anthony to include English in the Eighth Schedule, Nehru gave an assurance to them (on 7 August 1959): > I believe also two things. As I just said, there must be no imposition. > Secondly, for an indefinite period ‚Äì I do not know how long ‚Äì I should have, > I would have English as an associate, additional language which can be used > not because of facilities and all that... but because I do not wish the > people of Non-Hindi areas to feel that certain doors of advance are closed > to them because they are forced to correspond ‚Äì the Government, I mean ‚Äì in > the Hindi language. They can correspond in English. So I could have it as an > alternate language as long as people require it and the decision for that ‚Äì > I would leave not to the Hindi-knowing people, but to the non-Hindi-knowing > people. This assurance momentarily allayed the fears of the South Indians. But the Hindi proponents were dismayed and Pant remarked \\"Whatever I achieved in two years, the prime minister destroyed in less than two minutes\\". DMK's \\"Anti- Hindi imposition\\" policies The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) which split from the Dravidar Kazhagam in 1949, inherited the anti-Hindi policies of its parent organisation. DMK's founder Annadurai had earlier participated in the anti-Hindi imposition agitations during 1938‚Äì40 and in the 1940s. In July 1953, the DMK launched the Kallakudi demonstration against changing the name of a town from Kallakudi to Dalmiapuram. They claimed that the town's name (after Ramkrishna Dalmia) symbolised the exploitation of South India by the North. On 15 July 1953, M. Karunanidhi (later Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu) and other DMK members erased the Hindi name in Dalmiapuram railway station's name board and lay down on the tracks. In the altercation with the Police that followed the protests, two DMK members lost their lives and several others including Karunanidhi and Kannadhasan were arrested. In the 1950s DMK continued its anti-Hindi policies along with the secessionist demand for Dravida Nadu. On 28 January 1956, Annadurai along with Periyar and Rajaji signed a resolution passed by the Academy of Tamil Culture endorsing the continuation of English as the official language. On 21 September 1957 the DMK convened an anti-Hindi Conference to protest against the imposition of Hindi. It observed 13 October 1957 as \\"anti-Hindi Day\\". On 31 July 1960, another open air anti-Hindi conference was held at Kodambakkam, Madras. In November 1963, DMK dropped its secessionist demand in the wake of the Sino-Indian War and the passage of the anti-secessionist 16th Amendment to the Indian Constitution. But the anti-Hindi stance remained and hardened with the passage of Official Languages Act of 1963. The DMK's view on Hindi's qualifications for official language status were reflected in Annadurai's response to the \\"numerical superiority of Hindi\\" argument: \\"If we had to accept the principle of numerical superiority while selecting our national bird, the choice would have fallen not on the peacock but on the common crow.\\"  Official Languages Act of 1963  As the deadline stipulated in Part XVII of the Constitution for switching to Hindi as primary official language approached, the central government stepped up its efforts to spread Hindi's official usage. In 1960, compulsory training for Hindi typing and stenography was started. The same year, India's president Rajendra Prasad acted on the Pant Committee's recommendations and issued orders for preparation of Hindi glossaries, translating procedural literature and legal codes to Hindi, imparting Hindi education to government employees and other efforts for propagating Hindi. To give legal status to Nehru's assurance of 1959, the Official Languages Act was passed in 1963. In Nehru's own words: > This is a Bill, in continuation of what has happened in the past, to remove > a restriction which had been placed by the Constitution on the use of > English after a certain date i.e. 1965. It is just to remove that > restriction that this is placed. The Bill was introduced in Parliament on 21 January 1963. Opposition to the Bill came from DMK members who objected to the usage of the word \\"may\\" instead of \\"shall\\" in section 3 of the Bill. That section read: \\"the English language may...continue to be used in addition to Hindi\\". The DMK argued was that the term \\"may\\" could be interpreted as \\"may not\\" by future administrations. They feared that the minority opinion would not be considered and non-Hindi speakers' views would be ignored. On 22 April, Nehru assured the parliamentarians that, for that particular case \\"may\\" had the same meaning as \\"shall\\". The DMK then demanded, if that was the case why \\"shall\\" was not used instead of \\"may\\". Leading the opposition to the Bill was Annadurai (then a Member of the Rajya Sabha). He pleaded for an indefinite continuation of the status quo and argued that continued use of English as official language would \\"distribute advantages or disadvantages evenly\\" among Hindi and non-Hindi speakers. The Bill was passed on 27 April without any change in the wording. As he had warned earlier, Annadurai launched statewide protests against Hindi. In November 1963, Annadurai was arrested along with 500 DMK members for burning part XVII of the Constitution at an anti-Hindi Conference. He was sentenced to six months in prison. On 25 January 1964, a DMK member, Chinnasamy, committed suicide at Trichy by self-immolation, to protest the \\"imposition of Hindi\\". He was claimed as the first \\"language martyr\\" of the second round of the anti-Hindi struggle by the DMK. Nehru died in May 1964 and Lal Bahadur Shastri became Prime Minister of India. Shastri and his senior cabinet members Morarji Desai and Gulzari Lal Nanda were strong supporters of Hindi being the sole official language. This increased the apprehension that Nehru's assurances of 1959 and 1963 would not be kept despite Shastri's assurances to the contrary. Concerns over the preference of Hindi in central government jobs, civil service examinations and the fear that English would be replaced with Hindi as medium of instruction brought students into the anti- Hindi imposition agitation camp in large numbers. On 7 March 1964, the chief minister of Madras State, M. Bhaktavatsalam at a session of the Madras Legislative Assembly recommended the introduction of Three-language formula (English, Hindi and Tamil) in the state. Apprehension over the Three-language formula increased student support for the anti-Hindi cause. Agitation of 1965 (Front row : left to right) K. A. Mathialagan, C. N. Annadurai, Rajaji and M. Karunanidhi As 26 January 1965 approached, the anti-Hindi imposition agitation in Madras State grew in numbers and urgency. The Tamil Nadu Students Anti Hindi Agitation Council was formed in January as an umbrella student organisation to coordinate the anti-Hindi efforts. The office bearers of the council were student union leaders from all over Madras State including P. Seenivasan, K. Kalimuthu, Jeeva Kalaimani, Na. Kamarasan, Seyaprakasam, Ravichandran, Tiruppur. S. Duraiswamy, Sedapatti Muthaiah, Durai Murugan, K. Raja Mohammad, Navalavan, M. Natarajan and L. Ganesan. Several student conferences were organised throughout the state to protest against Hindi imposition. On 17 January, the Madras State Anti-Hindi Conference was convened at Trichy and was attended by 700 delegates from Madras, Maharashtra, Kerala and Mysore. They called for the indefinite suspension of Part XVII of the constitution. The Home and Information & Broadcasting ministries of the central government (headed by Nanda and Indira Gandhi respectively) upped the ante and issued circulars for replacing English with Hindi from 26 January. On 16 January, Annadurai announced that 26 January (also the Republic Day of India) would be observed as a day of mourning. Chief minister Bhaktavatsalam warned that the state government would not tolerate the sanctity of the Republic day blasphemed and threatened the students with \\"stern action\\" if they participated in politics. The DMK advanced the \\"Day of Mourning\\" by a day. On 25 January, Annadurai was taken into preventive custody along with 3000 DMK members to forestall the agitations planned for the next day. On 26 January, 50,000 students from Madras city's colleges marched from Napier park to the Government secretariat at Fort St. George and unsuccessfully tried to petition the chief minister. On 25 January, a clash between agitating students and Congress party workers in Madurai went out of control and became a riot. Rioting soon spread to other parts of the State. Police responded with lathi charges and firing on student processions. Acts of arson, looting and damage to public property became common. Railway cars and Hindi name boards at railway stations were burned down; telegraph poles were cut and railway tracks displaced. The Bhaktavatsalam Government considered the situation as a law and order problem and brought in para military forces to quell the agitation. Incensed by police action, violent mobs killed two police men. Several agitators committed suicide by self-immolation and by consuming poison. In two weeks of riots, around 70 people were killed (by official estimates). Some unofficial reports put the death toll as high as 500. A large number of students were arrested. The damage to property was assessed to be ten million rupees. On 28 January, classes in Madras University, Annamalai University and other colleges and schools in the state were suspended indefinitely. Within the Congress, opinion was divided: one group led by K. Kamaraj wanted the government not to impose Hindi on the Tamils; but others like Morarji Desai did not relent. Home minister Nanda agreed with Bhaktavatsalam's handling of the agitation. Rioting continued throughout the first week of February and by the second week students lost control of the agitation. Violence continued despite Annadurai's appeal for calm. Efforts were made by both sides to find a compromise. On 11 February, C. Subramaniam and O. V. Alagesan, two union ministers from Madras state, resigned protesting the government's language policy. President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan refused to accept the Prime Minister Shastri's recommendation that their resignations be accepted. Shastri backed down and made a broadcast through All India Radio on 11 February. Expressing shock over the riots, he promised to honour Nehru's assurances. He also assured Tamils that English would continue to be used for centre-state and intrastate communications and that the All India Civil Services examination would continue to be conducted in English. =Impact= Shastri's assurances calmed down the volatile situation. On 12 February, the students council postponed the agitation indefinitely and on 16 February, C. Subramaniam and O. V. Alagesan withdrew their resignations. Sporadic acts of protests and violence continued to happen throughout February and early March. On 7 March, the administration withdrew all the cases filed against the student leaders and on 14 March, the Anti-Hindi imposition Agitation Council dropped the agitation. Shastri's climbdown angered the pro-Hindi activists in North India. Members of Jan Sangh went about the streets of New Delhi, blackening out English signs with tar. The agitation slowly changed into a general anti-Congress organisation. In the 1967 election, student leader P. Seenivasan contested against Kamaraj in the Virudhunagar constituency. A large number of students from all over the state campaigned for him and ensured his victory: the Congress party was defeated and DMK came to power for the first time in Madras State. The Anti-Hindi imposition agitations in Tamil Nadu also had a considerable impact on the neighbouring states of Andhra Pradesh, Mysore and Kerala. The 1965 agitations evoked a strong response from the Tamils of Bangalore city. In Mysore, over 2000 agitators gathered to protest Hindi and the police had to launch a lathi charge when the agitation grew violent. In Andhra Pradesh, trains were damaged and colleges were shut down. Official Languages (Amendment) Act of 1967 =Amendment efforts in 1965= Efforts to amend the Official Languages Act according to Shastri's assurances given in February 1965 faced stiff resistance from the pro-Hindi lobby. On 16 February 55 MPs from 8 different states publicly expressed their disapproval of any change in the Language policy. On 19 February 19 MPs from Maharashtra and Gujarat voiced their opposition for change and on 25 February 106 Congress MPs met the Prime Minister to request him not to amend the Act. However, Congress MPs from Madras did not debate the issue on the Parliament floor but met the Prime Minister on 12 March. Congress and opposition parties hesitated to debate the issue in Parliament as they did not wish to make their bitter divisions in public. On 22 February at a meeting in Congress Working Committee, K. Kamaraj pressed for the amendment to Official Languages Act, but received instant opposition from Morarji Desai, Jagjivan Ram and Ram Subhag. The Congress working committee finally agreed to a resolution which amounted to slowing down of Hindi-isation, strong implementation of the three language formula in Hindi and non-Hindi speaking states, and conduct of the public services exam in all regional languages. These decisions were agreed upon during the Chief Ministers' meeting which was held on 24 February. The three language formula was not strictly enforced either in South or Hindi-speaking areas. The changes to public services exams were impractical and not well received by government officials. The only real concession to the south was the assurance that the Official Languages Act would be modified. However, any effort to follow through with that pledge received stiff resistance. In April 1965, a meeting of a cabinet sub-committee comprising Gulzari lal Nanda, A. K. Sen, Satyanarayan Sinha, Mahavir Tyagi, M. C. Chagla and S. K. Patil and but no southern members debated the issue and could not come to any agreement. The sub-committee recommended the continuation of English and Hindi as joint link languages and was not in favour of either quota system or use of regional languages in public services exams. They drafted an amendment to Official Languages Act incorporating Nehru's assurances explicitly. This Bill guaranteeing the use of English in inter-state and state-Union communications as long as desired by Non-Hindi states was approved for discussion by the Speaker on 25 August. But it was withdrawn after a bitter debate citing inopportune time due to the ongoing Punjabi Suba movement and Kashmir crisis at that time. =Amendment in 1967= Shastri died in January 1966 and Indira Gandhi became prime minister. The election of 1967 saw Congress retaining power with a reduced majority in the Centre. In Madras State, Congress was defeated and DMK came to power thanks to the support of the entire student community who had taken up the challenge thrown by Kamaraj to defeat him in the elections. The Students' Election Army did door to door campaign urging people to vote against Congress to teach them a lesson for all the atrocities committed by the Bhaktavatsalam Government to students under Defence of India Rules etc., P. Sreenivasan defeated Kamaraj in Virudhunagar. In November 1967, a new attempt to amend the Bill was made. On 27 November, the Bill was tabled in Parliament; it was passed on 16 December (by 205 votes to 41 against). It received presidential assent on 8 January 1968 and came into effect. The Amendment modified section 3 of the 1963 Act to guarantee the \\"virtual indefinite policy of bilingualism\\" (English and Hindi) in official transactions. Agitation of 1968 The anti-Hindi activists from Madras State were not satisfied with the 1967 Amendment, as it did not address their concerns about the three language formula. However, with DMK in power, they hesitated to restart the agitation. The Tamil Nadu Students' Anti-Hindi imposition Agitation council split into several factions. The moderate factions favored letting Annadurai and the government to deal with the situation. The extremist factions restarted the agitations. They demanded scrapping of the three language formula and an end to teaching of Hindi, abolishing the use of Hindi commands in the National Cadet Corps (NCC), banning of Hindi films and songs and closure of the Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachara Sabha (Institution for Propagation of Hindi in South India). On 19 December 1967, the agitation was restarted. It turned violent on 21 December and acts of arson and looting were reported in the state. Annadurai defused the situation by accepting most of their demands. On 23 January 1968, a resolution was passed in the Legislative Assembly. It accomplished the following: The Three-Language Policy was scrapped and Hindi was eliminated from the curriculum. Only English and Tamil were to be taught and the use of Hindi commands in the NCC was banned. Tamil was to be introduced as the medium of instruction in all colleges and as the \\"language of administration\\" within five years, the Central Government was urged to end the special status accorded to Hindi in the Constitution and \\"treat all languages equally\\", and was urged to provide financial assistance for development of all languages mentioned in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution. These measures satisfied the agitators and \\"normalcy\\" returned by February 1968. Agitation of 1986 In 1986, Indian Prime minister Rajiv Gandhi introduced the \\"National Education Policy\\". This education policy provided for setting up Navodaya Schools, where the DMK claimed teaching of Hindi would be compulsory. The Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (ADMK) led by M. G. Ramachandran (which had split from the DMK in 1972), was in power in Tamil Nadu and the DMK was the main opposition party. Karunanidhi announced an agitation against the opening of Navodaya schools in Tamil Nadu. The Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya program, supported fully by the Ministry of Human Resource Development, was established to identify gifted and talented students from economically disadvantaged and historically neglected communities, throughout every state and Union Territory in India and provide for them an education on par with elite residential schools traditionally available in India only for children of the wealthy as well as children of the political class. On 13 November, the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly unanimously passed a resolution demanding the repeal of Part XVII of the constitution and for making English the sole official language of the union. On 17 November 1986, DMK members protested against the new education policy by burning Part XVII of the Constitution. 20,000 DMK members, including Karunanidhi, were arrested. 21 persons committed suicide by self-immolation. Karunanidhi was sentenced to ten weeks of rigorous imprisonment. Ten DMK MLAs including K. Anbazhagan were expelled from the Legislative Assembly by the speaker P. H. Pandian. Rajiv Gandhi assured Members of Parliament from Tamil Nadu that Hindi would not be imposed. As part of the compromise, Navodhaya schools were not started in Tamil Nadu. Currently, Tamil Nadu is the only state in India without Navodaya schools. Agitation of 2014 In 2014, the Home Ministry ordered that \\"government employees and officials of all ministries, departments, corporations or banks, who have made official accounts on social networking sites should use Hindi, or both Hindi and English but give priority to Hindi\\". This move was immediately opposed by all the political parties in Tamil Nadu. Terming the move on use of Hindi as being \\"against letter and spirit\\" of the Official Languages Act the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa cautioned that this direction may \\"cause disquiet to the people of Tamil Nadu who are very proud of and passionate about their linguistic heritage,\\" and asked the Prime Minister of India to suitably modify the instructions to ensure that English was the language of communication on social media. The major opposition party Indian National Congress advised prudence, expressing fear that such directions may result in a backlash in non-Hindi states, especially Tamil Nadu and also said that the \\"Government would be well-advised to proceed with caution,\\". These protests ensured the continuous official usage of English. Impact A memorial for those who died in the Anti-Hindi imposition agitations in Chennai The anti-Hindi imposition agitations of 1937‚Äì40 and 1940‚Äì50 led to a change of guard in the Madras Presidency. The main opposition party to the Indian National Congress in the state, the Justice Party, came under Periyar's leadership on 29 December 1938. In 1944, the Justice Party was renamed as Dravidar Kazhagam. The political careers of many later leaders of the Dravidian Movement, such as C. N. Annadurai and M. Karunanidhi, started with their participation in these agitations. The agitations stopped the compulsory teaching of Hindi in the state. The agitations of the 1960s played a crucial role in the defeat of the Tamil Nadu Congress party in the 1967 elections and the continuing dominance of Dravidian parties in Tamil Nadu politics. Many political leaders of the DMK and ADMK, like P. Seenivasan, K. Kalimuthu, Durai Murugan, Tiruppur. S. Duraiswamy, Sedapatti Muthaiah, K. Raja Mohammad, M. Natarajan and L. Ganesan, owe their entry and advancement in politics to their stints as student leaders during the agitations, which also reshaped the Dravidian Movement and broadened its political base, when it shifted from its earlier pro-Tamil (and anti-Brahmin) stance to a more inclusive one, which was both anti-Hindi and pro-English. Finally, the current two-language education policy followed in Tamil Nadu is also a direct result of the agitations. In the words of Sumathi Ramaswamy (Professor of History at Duke University), > [The anti-Hindi imposition agitations knit] together diverse, even > incompatible, social and political interests... Their common cause against > Hindi had thrown together religious revivalists like Maraimalai Atikal > (1876‚Äì1950) with avowed atheists like Ramasami and Bharathidasan > (1891‚Äì1964); men who supported the Indian cause like T.V. Kalyanasundaram > (1883‚Äì1953) and M. P. Sivagnanam with those who wanted to secede from India > like Annadurai and M. Karunanidhi (b. 1924); university professors like > Somasundara Bharati (1879‚Äì1959) and M.S. Purnalingam Pillai (1866 -1947) > with uneducated street poets, populist pamphleteers and college students. The anti-Hindi imposition agitations ensured the passage of the Official Languages Act of 1963 and its amendment in 1967, thus ensuring the continued use of English as an official language of India.

Gracillariidae is an important family of insects in the order Lepidoptera and the principal family of leaf miners that includes several economic, horticultural or recently invasive pest species such as the horse-chestnut leaf miner, Cameraria ohridella. Taxonomy and systematics There are 98 described genera of Gracillariidae (see below). A complete checklist is available of all currently recognised species (de Prins and de Prins 2005). There are many undescribed species in the tropics but there is also an online catalogue of Afrotropical described species ; the South African fauna is quite well known. Although Japanese and Russian authors have recognised additional subfamilies (de Prins and de Prins, 2005), there are three currently recognised subfamilies, Phyllocnistinae of which is likely to be basal. In this subfamily, the primitive genus Prophyllocnistis from Chile feeds on the plant genus Drimys (Winteraceae), and has leaf mines structurally similar in structure to fossils (Davis, 1994) (see \\"Fossils\\"). While there have been some recent DNA sequence-based studies of Palaearctic species (Lopez-Vaamonde et al., 2003, 2006), there is need for a satisfactory modern global phylogenetic framework for the subfamilies of Gracillariidae. Some genera are very large, e.g. Acrocercops, Caloptilia, Cameraria, Epicephala and Phyllonorycter. Distribution Gracillariidae occur in all terrestrial regions of the World except Antarctica. Identification These generally small (wingspan 5‚Äì20 mm) moths are leaf miners as caterpillars, which can provide a useful means of identification, especially if the hostplant is known. The subfamilies differ by the adult moth resting posture (Davis and Robinson, 1999). Most Gracillariinae rest with the front of the body steeply raised; Lithocolletinae and Phyllocnistinae rest with the body parallel to the surface; in Lithocolletinae often with the head lowered. Life history The first to fifth-instar larvae are flattened and possess specialised mouthparts adapted for feeding on sap. Older-instar larvae are cylindrical and have normal chewing mouthparts for feeding on plant tissue within the leaf mines, and have a fully functional silk-producing organ, the \\"spinneret\\". Some genera have an intermediate stage in this remarkable hypermetamorphosis (Davis and Robinson, 1999). Larval hostplants Many hostplants are known, generally dicotyledonous trees or shrubs. Patterns of hostplant shifting have been inferred for many United Kingdom species in the genus Phyllonorycter and its sister genus Cameraria (Lopez-Vaamonde et al., 2003). A recent DNA sequencing study mainly of Palaearctic species has shown that the burst of evolutionary adaptive radiation occurred long after that of the larval hostplants, rather than demonstrating a tight coevolutionary process (Lopez-Vaamonde et al., 2006). Fossils The family is an old one, with fossil Phyllocnistinae mines known from 97-million-year-old rocks in Kansas and Nebraska (Labandeira et al. 1994). There are other fossil mines known from rocks of Eocene and Miocene age (de Prins and de Prins, 2005). There are also two adult moths known from Lithuanian or Baltic amber of Eocene age: Gracillariites lithuanicus Kozlov, 1987 and G. mixtus Kozlov, 1987) (de Prins and de Prins, 2005). Subfamilies and genera Horse-chestnut leaf miner (Cameraria ohridella) tree damage in Parma, Italy Gracillariidae phylogeny has been revised in 2017 and is now containing eight subfamilies (Kawahara et al. 2017): * Acrocercopinae Kawahara & Ohshima, 2016 * Gracillariinae Stainton, 1854 * Lithocolletinae Stainton, 1854 * Marmarinae Kawahara & Ohshima, 2016 * Oecophyllembiinae R√©al & Balachowsky, 1966 * Ornixolinae Kuznetzov & Baryshnikova, 2001 * Parornichinae Kawahara & Ohshima, 2016 * Phyllocnistinae Herrich-Sch√§ffer, 1857 Unplaced species *\\"Ornix\\" blandella M√ºller-Rutz, 1920, this species was described from Switzerland.

Like all ratites it was a member of the order Struthioniformes. The Struthioniformes are flightless birds with a sternum without a keel. They also have a distinctive palate. This genus contains three species, and are part of the Anomalopteryginae or lesser moa subfamily. Pachyornis moa were the stoutest and most heavy-legged genus of the family. The most notable species being Pachyornis elephantopus - the Heavy-Footed Moa. They were generally similar to the Eastern Moa or the Broad-billed moa of the genus Euryapteryx, but differed in having a pointed bill and being more heavyset in general. At least one species (P. australis) is assumed to have had a crest of long feathers on its head. The species became rapidly extinct following human colonization of New Zealand, with the possible exception of P. australis, which may have already been extinct by then-although the most recent moa skeleton ever described is a partial skeleton of this species, radiocarbon dated to between 1396 and 1442. Two new genetic lineages, which may eventually be described as new species, are now known to have existed, one each from New Zealand's North and South Island.

The aim of this project is to provide an alternative route for Russian and Kazakhstani oil and to ease the traffic burden in the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles. History The Samsun‚ÄìCeyhan pipeline was planned as a Bosphorus bypass. At the beginning of the 2000s, Tun Oil filed for construction of a pipeline from Samsun through Sivas to Ceyhan. In 2003, the Italian energy company Eni studied possible oil transport routes from the North Caspian area. In 2004, based on the pre-feasibility study, the Samsun‚ÄìCeyhan route was selected. Another partner in the project, Turkish company √áalƒ±k Enerji, carried out technical and commercial studies, and filed for the construction licence on 31 March 2004. One of the route alternatives involved connecting the Kirikkale refinery; however, this option was rejected. On 26 September 2005, Eni and √áalƒ±k Enerji signed a Memorandum of Understanding for their joint cooperation in the project. A pipeline feasibility study was completed in March 2006. The construction licence was granted in June 2006. The Front End Engineering Design Phase was completed at the beginning of 2007, and the ground-breaking ceremony, attended by the Italian Minister for Economic Development Pierluigi Bersani and the Turkish Minister for Energy and Natural Resources Hilmi G√ºler, was held in Ceyhan on 24 April 2007. In 2008, it was decided to move the starting point from Terme in Samsun Province to √únye in Ordu Province. On 19 October 2009, at a ceremony held in Milan Italy, Russia and Turkey signed an intergovernmental agreement guaranteeing a stable regulatory framework and agreeing to the participation of Russian oil companies in the pipeline project. At the same ceremony, Eni and √áalƒ±k Enerji signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Transneft and Rosneft to include Russian companies in the development of the project. On 27 March 2013, Turkish energy minister Taner Yildiz announced that Eni would not be allowed to go forward with the project due to company's plans for the natural gas exploration off Cyprus, and that the pipeline's project may be suspended if √áalƒ±k continues their partnership with Eni. Technical features and financing The project consists of the new unloading terminal and tank farm, a pipeline from the √únye terminal to Ceyhan, and additional storage capacity in Ceyhan. It will be connected with the existing Ceyhan loading terminal. The length of the pipeline will be . Starting from Sarƒ±z, the pipeline will follow the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline's corridor. The diameter of the pipe will vary from to . It will have four pumping stations and one pressure-reducing station. The designed capacity is and initial capacity is . The tank farm in Samsun will have a storage capacity of and the additional tank farm in Ceyhan . The pipeline is scheduled to become operational in 2012. The project costs are expected to be around $2 billion. Pipeline company The pipeline will be constructed, owned and operated by the Trans-Anatolian Pipeline Company (TAPCO), a joint venture of Eni and √áalƒ±k Enerji incorporated in Turkey. In 2006, it was announced that Indian Oil Corporation will have a 12.5% stake in the project; however, this deal was not completed. Also Royal Dutch Shell and Total S.A. had expressed their interest in the project. In 2009, it was decided that the new partners in the project will be Rosneft and Transneft, while Lukoil and Kazakhstan have expressed interest in participating in the project.

It is similar to the 5-course baroque guitar, but larger and typically strung with five double strings, traditionally made of brass, but currently - steel. Nowadays it is typically used by folk musicians, mainly in the southern Italian regions of Calabria, Apulia, Basilicata, and Campania, as well as in other areas of southern Italy; in past centuries the instrument was found in most of central and southern Italy. History It is considered a folk instrument, though it has its origins in the Italian court music in the early Baroque era. Musicologists refer to the \\"historical\\" as well as the \\"folk\\" chitarra battente. There are many extant historical 17th century instruments in museums. The chitarra battente comes in three sizes. The medium and large instruments are the most common. The instrument may have five or four courses of strings. These courses are typically double or triple, a‚Äúcourse‚Äù being a group of 2 or 3 strings plucked as a single unit. Thus chitarra battente is typically a five or four-course instrument. There is great variation in the size of the bouts (the rounded ‚Äúhourglass‚Äù curves of the body of the instrument), kinds of wood, shape of the back, decorations, number of frets, etc. The strings are tuned in what is called a ‚Äúre-entrant‚Äù system; that is, unlike a modern classical guitar, the lower strings may be tuned to higher pitches. The instrument is played without a plectrum, and the fingers achieve a wide range of effects through plucking, strumming, beating the strings or the sound board, etc. The chitarra battente is typically used to accompany singing or dancing and can be played in an ensemble or as a solo instrument. The most important center of production is in Bisignano in the province of Cosenza. Traditionally the instrument has been made locally in the region from which its characteristics derive, often being constructed by non-professional craftsmen or simple carpenters.

This 53 km-long right tributary to the White Drin river flows entirely within the western part of Kosovo (the Metohija/Dukagjini region).  Name  The name of the river, Bistrica, means \\"clearwater\\" in Serbian. The adjective Deƒçanska, \\"of Deƒçani\\", is added to distinguish it from other Bistrica rivers in the Metohija region: Peƒá Bistrica (\\"of Peƒá\\"), Prizren Bistrica (\\"of Prizren\\"), Ko≈ænjar Bistrica (\\"of Ko≈ænjar\\"), Loƒáane Bistrica (\\"of Loƒáane\\"), etc.  Prokletije and Gorge of De√ßan  De√ßan Bistrica originates from the southern slopes of the Bogiƒáevica mountain, a part of the massive Prokletije mountain system. The river flows north of the ƒêeravica peak, the highest in Kosovo (2,656 m), initially under the name of Ko≈ænjarska Bistrica, and receives many streams from the Bogiƒáevica, Micinat, Streƒçoka and Kopranik mountains. The river turns southeast on the northern slopes of the Koprivnik and Streƒçoka mountains, where it carved the deep gorge of De√ßan (Deƒçanska klisura). The upper part of the gorge is the glacial trough of the ancient De√ßan glacier on the Prokletije mountain.  Metohija region  As the river flows out of the gorge it reaches the medieval monastery of Visoki Deƒçani, which is on UNESCO's World Heritage List. The river continues eastward, in the very densely populated area next to the small town of Deƒçani and the villages of Istiniƒá, Beleg, Brdliƒá, Vranovac and Jablanica, before it empties into the White Drin. In the upper course, the waters of the river are used for the Ko≈ænjar hydroelectrical power plant (6.5 MW). In the lower parts its waters are, to some extent, used for irrigation.

Zevi was a vocal critic of \\"classicizing\\" modern architecture and postmodernism. Early life Zevi was born and died in Rome. His family was Italian Jewish.His kin never kept him from openly expressing his own ideas: Art Kutcher () remembers a protest in 1970 against Teddy Kollek, opposing the project of building an underground parking near the Jaffa Gate. On finishing school in 1933, he enrolled at the Faculty of Architecture at the University of Rome. Due to the anti-Semitic laws, Zevi was forced in 1938 to abandon his studies, and so left for London, UK, before moving to the United States. Zevi graduated from the Harvard Graduate School of Design, then under the directorship of Walter Gropius. In 1940 he married Italian journalist and writer Tullia Calabi. While in the US he discovered the work of Frank Lloyd Wright, which became one of the bases for his championing of organic architecture. Zevi returned to London in 1943, working as a translator in the war effort. Association for Organic Architecture In 1944, he founded the influential Association for Organic Architecture (APAO). The following year the magazine Metron-architecture reviewed his book Towards an Organic Architecture, which brought him international acclaim. A stairway in Rome named in his honor University professor In 1945, Zevi became Professor of Architectural History at the University of Venice. Later, he was a Professor at the University of Rome, and a member of the International Academy of Architecture (IAA) in Sofia, Bulgaria. Editor, writer and politician From 1955 onwards, he wrote a column for the weekly L'Espresso magazine. He was an active member of the Italian Jewish community, and took part in anti-fascist activities within the Giustizia e Libert√† movement. He was active in the Action Party and later in Popular Unity and in the Radical Party, which he represented in the Chamber of Deputies from 1987 to 1992. From 1954 until his death in 2000 he was editor of his own magazine L'architettura. Cronache e storia. The Modern Language of Architecture is one of Zevi‚Äôs most significant publications. In this book Zevi sets forth seven principles or ‚Äúantirules‚Äù to codify the language of architecture created by Le Corbusier, Gropius, Mies van der Rohe, and Wright. In place of the classical language of the Beaux Art school, with its focus on abstract principles of order, proportion, and symmetry, he presents an alternative system of communication characterized by a free interpretation of contents and function, an emphasis on difference and dissonance, a dynamic of multidimensional vision, and independent interplay of elements, an organic marriage of engineering and design, a concept of living spaces that are designed for use, and an integration of buildings into their surroundings. Anticipating the innovations of postmodern architecture, Zevi argues forcefully for complexity and against unity, for decomposition dialogue between architecture and historiography, finding elements of the modern language of architecture throughout history, and discussing the process of architectural innovation. Architecture as space Zevi argued in Saper vedere l'architettura that space is essential for both the definition and appreciation of architecture. Modern architecture movement Zevi participated in the influential International Architecture Symposium \\"Mensch und Raum\\" (Man and Space) at the Vienna University of Technology (Technische Universit√§t Wien) in 1984, also attended by Justus Dahinden, Ernst Gisel, Jorge Glusberg, Otto Kapfinger, Frei Otto, Ionel Schein, Dennis Sharp, Paolo Soleri, and Pierre Vago. Such was Zevi's uncompromising critique of any tendency in modern architecture towards classicism that he even would criticize those architects he otherwise admired: \\"When Gropius, Mies and Aalto produced [symmetrical buildings] it was an act of surrender. Lacking a modern code, they weakened and regressed to the familiar womb of classicism.\\"  Quotes  \\"In 1973, Zevi set out (his) ideas as a set of invariants - a sort of anti-classical codebook that attempted to define modernity as a language of asymmetry and dissonance, which he propagated via his magazine L'architettura, cronache e storia. This exciting theory of architecture as rupture and fragmentation marks him out as the seminal theoretician for all currents of modernism interested in iconoclasm and deconstruction, from Alvar Aalto in the 1930s to Daniel Libeskind in the 1990s.\\" (Thomas Muirhead, March 1, 2000; The Guardian, Obituary, 2000)Thomas Muirhead, 'Bruno Zevi, Architectural philosopher who railed against the evils of classicism', The Guardian, Wednesday 1 March 2000  Select publications *(English translation) *(English translation) *(English translation)  References  Bibliography  * .

Ingredients The ingredients in monjayaki are finely chopped and mixed into the batter before frying. Monjayaki batter has ingredients similar to okonomiyaki. However, additional dashi or water is added to the monjayaki batter mixture, making it runnier than okonomiyaki. The consistency of cooked monjayaki is comparable to melted cheese. Diners eat directly from the grill using a small spatula. Monjayaki diners also participate in the cooking by spreading raw monja on the grill so that crispy bits form and caramelize. Many monjayaki restaurants can be found in the Tsukishima district of Tokyo where the dish is said to have originated.

It provides routine and specialist orthopaedic surgery, plastic surgery and rheumatology services to the people of Oxfordshire. Specialist services, such as the treatment of osteomyelitis and bone tumours, and the rehabilitation of those with limb amputation, congenital deficiency and neurological disabilities, are provided for patients from across the UK and abroad. It is managed by the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.  History  Funded by a donation from Mrs. Hannah Wingfield, the hospital began work as the Wingfield Convalescent Centre in 1872. During the First World War it was a military hospital and was expanded by building a fresh air annexe of wooden buildings. By 1929 the Wingfield Morris Hospital badly needed rebuilding and Lord Nuffield, then Sir William Morris, donated ¬£70,000 to build new nurses' quarters, seven new wards and a massage department. In recognition of Morris' contribution, the hospital became the Wingfield-Morris Orthopaedic Hospital in 1930. In 1936 Lord Nuffield announced a further gift to Oxford University Medical School which created five clinical chairs, and Professor Gathorne Robert Girdlestone became the first Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery in 1937. During the Second World War the hospital was controlled by the War Office. In 1948 it was designated as a regional orthopaedic centre and in 1950 it was renamed the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre. Thanks among others to the appointments in 1949, of Josep Trueta and in 1966, of Robert Duthie, the centre established its prestige and international reputation. Duthie championed its independence and on 1 April 1991 the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre became an NHS Trust hospital.  Research  The Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust is a member of the Oxford Research and Development Consortium. The research activities within the consortium are divided into fifteen collaborative research groups (CRGs). The NOC belongs to the musculo-skeletal group, which covers research activities in the fields of orthopaedics, rheumatology, metabolic medicine, neurological and functional rehabilitation and physiotherapy and have close links and collaboration with the University of Oxford and Oxford Brookes University.

The school received a Grade 3 (satisfactory) rating from Ofsted in 2012.  Structure  Acklam Grange uses pastoral management schemes that manage the pupils by year group, with students being assigned a form tutor with whom they have significant daily contact and who is their contact point for any issues. This was chosen instead of a house system. Rewards for pupils are issued in a tiered system, including certificates, vouchers, and school trips. In Year 11, pupils have the opportunity to become prefects and senior prefects, where they assist in the management of the school and are overseen by a Head Boy and Head Girl.

Dick, Volume One: The Variable Man & Other Stories in 2009. \\"Adjustment Team\\" served as the basis for the 2011 film The Adjustment Bureau. Synopsis Sector T137 is scheduled for adjustment, and a Clerk is supervising a canine Summoner to ensure real estate salesman Ed Fletcher is inside Sector T137 during the process. An 8:15 bark to summon a Friend With A Car is needed. Unfortunately, a one-minute delay in the bark prompts the appearance of an Insurance Salesman, causing Fletcher to leave for work late. Arriving at Sector T137 after it has been de-energized, Fletcher enters a terrifying gray ash world. Escaping white-robed men, he flees across the street back to the everyday energized world outside Sector T137, fearing he's had a psychotic episode. The Clerk is brought to the top-level Administrative Chambers to explain what went wrong to the Old Man, who decides to personally deal with this unusual situation and orders Fletcher \\"brought up here\\". Complicating matters further, Fletcher has told his wife Ruth about the experience. With Ruth accompanying him for moral support, Fletcher returns to his workplace to prove he has not experienced a full psychotic breakdown or seen behind the fabric of reality as he still fears. Things seem normal at first, and Ruth leaves, but he soon realizes people and objects have subtly changed. Panic stricken, he runs to a public phone to warn the police, only to have the phone booth ascend heavenward with Fletcher inside. Meeting the Old Man, Fletcher first thinks he is dead, but is informed he is only visiting; that a correction was being made, it was a very serious error, he was not changed, and his revealing to others what he saw is a grave threat. \\"The natural process must be supplemented‚Äîadjusted here and there. Corrections must be made. We are fully licensed to make such corrections. Our adjustment teams perform vital work.\\" In this instance, the adjustment is to bring about a chain of events that will lessen Soviet‚ÄìWestern Bloc war tension. Fletcher is allowed to return without being de-energized and adjusted, on the condition that he tell no one the truth he has learned, and convinces his wife that everything he has already told her was due to a temporary psychological fit. The Old Man threatens him that should he fail doing so, he will have a terrible fate when they meet again; and he adds that every person eventually meets the Old Man. On his return, Ruth catches him lying about where he spent the afternoon and demands he tell her the truth, while he tries to stall her long enough to come up with a story she will believe. A bark is heard and a vacuum cleaner salesman rings the doorbell. While Ruth is distracted by the salesman's demonstration, Fletcher escapes to the bedroom, where he shakily lights a cigarette and gratefully looks up, saying, \\"Thanks ... I think we'll make it‚Äîafter all. Thanks a lot.\\" Critical commentary Richard Mullen, the founder of the journal Science Fiction Studies, described the story as Dick's \\"first tentative try\\" at Frederik Pohl's \\"tunnel under the world\\" theme, in which it is imagined that mundane existence is totally a product of unseen manipulators.

Name The event is named because it follows historical water transportation routes on Lake M√§laren which have been used since the so-called Viking times, ca 1000 CE. History The first race was in 1999 when about 4000 skaters participated. The event had to be cancelled in 2000 and 2002 due to poor ice conditions on the planned race date, and again in 2008 due to nearly complete absence of ice all through the winter along the planned route. Beginning in 2003, the race date is only set a few weeks beforehand, depending on short term predictions of ice conditions. Beginning in 2006 most of the 80 km course, called Vikingaslingan, was kept ploughed for the entire three-month skating season, not just for the race event.

Biography Holness gained his nickname \\"Niney\\" after losing a thumb in a workshop accident. In the latter half of the 1960s he worked as an engineer at KG records, where he began producing. His first release was his own composition \\"Come on Baby\\" issued on his Destroyer label. He moved on to work with Bunny Lee in 1967, then for Lynford Anderson's studio, then working for Joe Gibbs as chief sound engineer, replacing his friend Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry. While working for Gibbs he produced Dennis Alcapone and Lizzy's \\"Mr. Brown\\", and played a major role in launching the career of Dennis Brown. After leaving Gibbs' setup, his first major success as a producer was \\"Blood & Fire\\" in December 1970, initially released in a pressing of 200 on his Destroyer label, but reissued the following year on his Observer label, and going on to sell over 30,000 copies in Jamaica.Larkin, Colin (1998), The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae, Virgin Books, . Inspired by Perry's nickname of \\"The Upsetter\\", Holness adopted \\"The Observer\\", using the name for his new Observer label, and the name of his house band, The Observers (actually the Soul Syndicate). Several singles followed, some reusing the \\"Blood & Fire\\" rhythm, including Big Youth's \\"Fire Bunn\\". In the early 1970s, Holness became one of Jamaica's most sought after producers, with Dennis Brown, Delroy Wilson, The Heptones, Johnny Clarke, Slim Smith, Jacob Miller, Junior Delgado, and Freddie McGregor all using his services. He also continued to record himself, on collaborations with Dennis Alcapone, Max Romeo, and Lee Perry. By the mid-1970s, he was also working with Ken Boothe, Junior Byles, Gregory Isaacs, Horace Andy, I-Roy, and Dillinger. The late 1970s saw him still active as a producer, but his output in the early 1980s was significantly less after relocating to France. He re-emerged in 1982 with the Ital Dub Observer Style album and returned to Kingston in 1983, taking on the role of house producer for the Hitbound label at Channel One Studios. In this capacity he was one of the first to work with Beenie Man, and also produced Third World and Sugar Minott. In the mid-1980s, he relocated to New York City, returning to Kingston again in 1988, and working with Yami Bolo, Frankie Paul, Andrew Tosh, and Junior Byles. He began an association with Heartbeat Records, working on reissues of much of his back catalogue, as well as new recordings. He continued to produce new material through the 1990s.

History  The castle originated from a fortified building that was erected in the 13th century next to the city's walls. This first building was called Castelvecchio (\\"Old Castle\\"), and was the seat of the Bishopric of Trent from the 13th century onwards to the end of the 18th century. The castle is composed of a series of buildings of different eras, enclosed by a circle of walls in a slightly elevated position above the town. The, as called, Castelvecchio is the oldest and most dominant building of the entire housing development. The Magno Palazzo is the sixteenth expansion in the forms of the Italian Renaissance, wanted by the Prince Bishop and Cardinal Bernardo Clesio (1485-1539), the third part, in the southern end of the complex is the known Eagle tower, which preserves the famous Cycle of the Months, one of the most fascinating pictorial cycles of profane late Middle Ages. Bishop George of Liechtenstein was the first to enlarge the castle, in the late 14th century, turning it into a well-styled residence. The Castelvecchio was further modified by Johannes Hinderbach, who had the double loggia Gothic entrance gate built. In the first decades of the 16th century, Bishop Bernardo Clesio had a new residence, called Palazzo Magno (\\"Grand Palace\\") built in Renaissance style alongside the old castle. The last great addition was the so-called Giunta Albertiana, from the name of Bishop Francesco Alberti Poja (1686), with which the Castelvecchio and the Palazzo Magno were united The castle remained the seat of the Prince-Bishops until 1803. Used by the Austrians as military barracks and, later, as a jail, it decayed. In the 1920s, when Trento was returned to Italy, it became seat of a National Museum and was restored. Since 1992 it is home to the Provincial Gallery of Art. According to legend, it was connected by a secret tunnel to the city's cathedral, which allowed the prince-bishops to move unseen between them. In 2015, rights were granted for the first time to film inside the castle, for Sebastiano Serafini's music video for his single \\"Akane\\".http://gekkayo.biz/2015/10/30/sebastianoserafini20051030/http://www.trentoblog.it/akane- e-lisola-del-buonconsiglio-il-nuovo-video-di-sebastiano-serafini-diretto-da- matteo-scotton/https://www.ufficiostampa.provincia.tn.it/Comunicati/AKANE-E-L- ISOLA-DEL-BUONCONSIGLIO-IL-NUOVO-VIDEO-DI-SEBASTIANO- SERAFINIhttp://www.trentinofilmcommission.it/it/SC/2021/SID/325/AKANE_E_LISOLA_DEL_BUONCONSIGLIO.html File:10 2014 Trento-Castello Buonconsiglio-Castelvecchio-Mastio Torre Augusto Sodegerio da Tito- Loggia veneziana tardo gotico Johannes Hinderbach-ITALY- K-5 II -Tamron AF 17-50mm F2.8-photo Paolo Villa FOTO8900 01.jpgFa√ßade of the castle File:10 2014 Trento-Castello Buonconsiglio-Castelvecchio-Mastio Torre Augusto Sodegerio da Tito- Loggia interna Johannes Hinderbach - ITALY- K-5 II -Tamron AF 17-50mm F2.8-photo Paolo Villa FOTO8909.JPGAugusto Tower view inside of the Castle File:10 2014 Trento-Castello Buonconsiglio-panorama Loggia veneziana gotica-Col Castion, Doss Trento, Mausoleo Cesare Battisti, Monte Soprasasso, Monte Terlago-ITALY- K-5 II -Tamron AF 17-50mm F2.8-photo Paolo Villa.jpgThe Venetian Gothic Loggia of the Buonconsiglio Castle  Interior  The interior halls have precious frescoes, including those in the Torre Aquila (\\"Eagle Tower\\"), which are one of the most noteworthy examples of International Gothic art in Europe: they represent the \\"Cycle of the Months\\" (15th century) and were made by an unknown artist from Bohemia. The cycle is interesting also for its accurate portrayal of the landscape, the economic activities, the habits and the fashion of Medieval Trentino. The walls of Torre del Falco (late 16th century) have frescoes with hunting scenes, also a rare example of German landscape painting in northern Italy. The decoration of the Palazzo Magno (Big Palace) section was commissioned in the early 16th century by prince-bishop Bernardo Clesio. Dosso Dossi and his brother Battista painted the frescoes in the Sala Grande, Sala degli Specchi, the Camera del Camin Nero, the Stua della Farnea (the refectory), the Library and others. Girolamo Romanino frescoed, among the others, the loggia in the Lions' Court (Cortile dei Leoni) with typical Renaissance themes, such as mythological or ancient Roman episodes, as well as biblical ones, and others from daily life. He also painted a portrait of Bernardo Clesio in the Sala delle Udienze (\\"Audience Hall\\"), accompanied by those of members of the Habsburg family (for which Clesio had worked as a diplomat).

It was written and directed by Chantal Akerman. Plot Henry Harriston is a psychoanalyst whose patients are driving him crazy by constantly leaving him messages during his off hours. On a whim he places an ad offering up his apartment for a housing swap. B√©atrice Saulnier (Juliette Binoche) a Parisian dancer responds to his ad and without meeting the two switch apartments. B√©atrice is impressed with Henry's high-tech apartment which is both beautiful and spacious. Henry meanwhile is horrified when he arrives in B√©atrice's apartment and finds it filthy and messy. Meanwhile, Henry's patients, who Henry sees at home, begin coming to his apartment seeking therapy. B√©atrice begins listening to their stories, and the patients accept her as Henry's temporary replacement. At B√©atrice's apartment Henry discovers a cache of love-letters written to B√©atrice by various men. B√©atrice's lovers also begin showing up in her apartment and talking to Henry about their love for her. When they begin calling the apartment telling Henry how helpful he was and how they want to talk to him again he turns tail and returns to New York. Originally intending to simply pick up his mail, Henry notices that his patients keep coming in and out of his apartment and, when he tries to enter his apartment, is pushed out by B√©atrice's friend who is posing as her receptionist. Believing that B√©atrice is intentionally running a scam, he goes to confront her, posing as a fake patient, John. Instead of confronting her however, he keeps up the ruse of being a patient, but is unable to talk and the session consists of B√©atrice and Henry saying \\"Yes\\" back and forth at one another. Despite this, the two find themselves attracted to one another and the session ends with B√©atrice suggesting that Henry, as John, come back. Henry meanwhile is convinced that B√©atrice really does mean well and decides to keep up the ruse and continue seeing her. After a particular session in which Henry talks about his distant relationship with his mother, both Henry and B√©atrice begin to think they've fallen in love with one another. Henry refuses to say anything, feeling too cowardly, while B√©atrice's friend tells her she cannot be involved in a relationship with a patient. B√©atrice and Henry become close and continue to feel strongly towards one another. During one of their sessions the light turns off and both secretly whisper love confessions in the dark, but neither hears what the other is saying. Henry's friend urges him to run to B√©atrice or write her a letter but as these are all things that B√©atrice's previous lovers have done that have failed, Henry refuses. He decides that the only way the situation will be resolved is if B√©atrice confesses her love to him. Instead she calls him late at night to tell him their sessions must come to an end as she is returning to Paris. Henry tells B√©atrice he loves her, but she hangs up before she hears what he has said. Henry rushes to the airport hoping to get a last minute flight to Paris. Unfortunately, the plane is overbooked. Henry decides to wait on standby. He is able to get the last ticket as one passenger has not shown up, however that ticket belonged to B√©atrice, so while Henry flies to Paris, searching the plane, looking for B√©atrice, B√©atrice stays behind. Eventually arriving home, B√©atrice realizes she cannot go to her apart as Henry is still in her apartment and goes to stay with her neighbour. On her neighbour's terrace she sees her plants which have flourished in her absence. She strikes up a conversation with Henry, who she cannot see through the plants. He disguises his voice so she will not recognize him. Talking to Henry through the plants B√©atrice confesses that she came early because she had fallen in love with one of Henry's patients, John. Realizing that Henry and John are one and the same person, B√©atrice climbs over the terrace back into her apartment and kisses Henry, telling him she loves him.

It was the first major battle of the Turkish War of Independence, and the three-week-long engagement in the city ultimately forced the French to abandon and retreat from Marash and resulted in a Turkish massacre of Armenian refugees who had just been repatriated to the city following the Armenian Genocide. Background After the surrender of the Ottoman Empire to the Allies in October 1918, the city of Marash had come under the joint-occupation of the British and French armies (the latter largely composed of Armenians from the French Armenian Legion).Hovannisian & Payaslian (2008) p. 497 In February 1919, Field Marshal Edmund Allenby appointed a number of French officers to oversee the administration of the region of Cilicia and the repatriation of tens of thousands of Armenians who had been deported during the war in the course of the Genocide. Within a few months, approximately 150,000 Armenians had been repatriated, including 20,000 natives from Marash.See Vahram Shemmassian, \\"The Repatriation of Armenian Refugees from the Arab Middle East, 1918‚Äì1920\\" in Armenian Cilicia, pp. 419‚Äì56. In the months following the end of the war, Cilicia had also become a source of dispute between the British and French, who both aspired to establish influence in the region. The British government, however, was under strong domestic pressure to withdraw and demobilize its forces in the Middle East and on 15 September 1919, Prime Minister David Lloyd George begrudgingly accepted a proposal by Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau to have the French formally assume control of Cilicia. The transfer of command took place on 4 November, but Field Marshal Ferdinand Foch's promise to reinforce the existing forces in the area with at least 32 infantry battalions, 20 cavalry squadrons and 14 artillery batteries went unfulfilled. The French units were thus deprived of armoured cars and air support and lacked automatic weapons, heavy artillery and even wireless transmitters and carrier pigeons.Hovannisian & Payaslian (2008) pp. 499-501. The French army was largely made up of Algerian or Senegalese soldiers who were not used to Cilicia's cold winter weather. =Turkish Nationalist movements= Marash was located in Aleppo Vilayet. The Anglo-French rivalry had led to the coalescence and strengthening of the Turkish National Movement under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Pasha. Atat√ºrk had denounced the Allied occupation of Cilicia in November 1919 and the forces loyal to him were tenaciously preparing to launch a major insurrection against the thinly spread French units garrisoned in Marash, Antep and Urfa. Experienced officers, including the captain Ali Kƒ±lƒ±√ß, were sent by Mustafa Kemal to organize the tribal units and chete (irregular fighters) bands in the region. The Turkish forces in Marash numbered 2,500. Some of them were armed with old hunting rifles and others with melee weapons. Before the battle, they obtained 850 rifles, 2 machine guns, 2 cannons (not used during the fighting), from the gendarmerie building in Marash.Toplumsal tarih (Edition 3), T√ºrkiye Ekonomik ve Toplumsal Tarih Vakfƒ±, 1995, p. 29. Those without firearms would arm themselves with rifles acquired from killed French soldiers. By January 1920, French supply convoys and communication lines were regularly coming under attack by the partisans and those Armenians who had been repatriated were being harassed and pressured to leave their homes once more.Hovannisian & Payaslian (2008) p. 502. The French attempted to mollify the minority Muslim elements (Circassians, Alevis, Kurds) in Marash by creating gendarmerie units but this only emboldened the Turkish Nationalists to hoist the Turkish flag over Marash's abandoned citadel and to intimidate those Muslims who cooperated with the French. The French troops in Marash included many Algerians, and also Armenians who had been recently enlisted, and it was stated that the latter had supposedly \\"annoyed the local population, by their arrogant attitude as they strolled on the streets in their French uniforms.\\"See Documents on British Foreign Policy, 1919‚Äì1939, vol. 7, p. 302. Seeing all this, Captain Pierre-Jean Daniel Andr√©, the head of the Marash detachment, requested additional reinforcements but, due to the indecisiveness of his superior, Lt. Colonel Jean Flye-Sainte-Marie, he was ordered to go to Adana to apprise the division commander, Brigadier General Julien Dufieux, of the situation. Dufieux agreed to send extra men under the command of General Qu√©rette to Marash but by 17 January, when the reinforcements arrived, the French had already lost the initiative: supply convoys in Bel Punar and El-Oghlu had come under attack and a relief column led by battalion commander Major Corneloup had been ambushed.Hovannisian & Payaslian (2008) pp. 506-09 On 21 January, General Qu√©rette summoned the Muslim notables of Marash to his headquarters located at a barracks in the north of the city and presented them with evidence pointing to their complicity in the attacks and demanded that they put an end to the hostilities. As the leaders departed, Turkish police chief Arslan Toƒüuz drew out his pistol and fired five rounds into the air, signalling the beginning of the uprising.The Lions of Marash (1973) Kerr pp. 95-96 Sahakyan, Ruben G.

Yerevan: Armenian Academy of Sciences, p. 149. Battle and Siege The bulk of the French garrison at Marash was made up of Armenians (such as those from the French Armenian Legion seen above), Algerians and Senegalese. The first French units to come under attack were those officers accompanying the local gendarmerie or standing guard. The contingents of the French garrison at Marash, numbering only 2,000 men, were separated from one another in the citywide siege. Direct communications did not exist between Marash and division headquarters and General Dufieux was only informed of the insurrection on 31 January, after several Armenians from the French Armenian Legion managed to disguise themselves as Muslims and cross the battle lines.Hovannisian & Payaslian (2008) pp.510-11 He immediately appointed Lieutenant Colonel Robert Normand to lead a relief expedition, composed of three infantry battalions and half a squadron of cavalry, to Marash, and dispatched aerial recon flights, giving hope to the besieged French, Armenians and American relief workers who were assisting the local population. Colonel Robert Normand has related the account of his campaign in Cilicia, including the campaign of Marash in his book Colonnes dans le Levant. Colonel Robert Normand led a brilliant career in the French army, when he returned to France. He was promoted to the grade of General de brigade, the youngest in the army to reach the grade. He ultimately became Directeur du G√©nie the highest responsibility in the engineering Corps. As such, he was responsible of the construction of the Ligne Maginot in France. He died, as General de Division, in a train accident in 1932. On 7 February, Normand's unit fought its way into the city and began to bombard the Turkish positions with heavy artillery. The following day, he relieved Cornelope's column, which had held its position for two weeks, and broke through to reach General Qu√©rette's headquarters. To Qu√©rette's astonishment, Normand told that he had come with orders from General Dufieux to begin the full evacuation of the French garrison of Marash, followed by the Christian and loyal Muslim population. Qu√©rette was reluctant to carry out such a command but Normand claimed that no more reinforcements or supplies would be sent. With this in mind Qu√©rette agreed to the evacuation. The order to evacuate ironically came at precisely the same moment that the Turkish Nationalists were seeking a ceasefire: no sooner had General Qu√©rette begun negotiations with the Turkish representative, Dr. Mustafa, when he was told by Normand to prepare to evacuate.Sahakyan. Turkish-French Relations, p. 153. By 3:00 in the morning of 11 February, Qu√©rette had destroyed the remaining ammunition dumps and was preparing to slip out under the cover of darkness. They were, however, unable to do so and 3,000 Armenians managed to flee with the French troops in a three-day, long march to ƒ∞slahiye. A thousand of the Armenian refugees had died from exhaustion and from the bitter cold by the time they reached ƒ∞slahiye on 13 February.\\"Armenian Refugees Perish in Blizzard.\\" The New York Times. 27 February 1920.See also Mabel E. Elliot (1924), Beginning Again at Ararat. New York, Chicago: Fleming H. Revell Company, pp. 115‚Äì31. The French casualties of the battle included 160 killed, 280 wounded, 170 missing and 300 severely frostbitten.Hovannisian (1996). pp. 41-42. =Massacre of Armenians= The three-week siege of Marash was also accompanied by the massacre of the Armenian repatriates. Early reports put the number of Armenian dead at no less than 16,000, although this was later revised down to 5,000‚Äì12,000, which were considered far more likely figures.Documents on British Foreign Policy, vol. 7, p. 303.The Lions of Marash (1973) Kerr p. 196 A surgeon at the German hospital reported that around 3,000 Armenians in the area around the Church of Saint Stephen had been killed by Turkish, Kurdish and Cherkess villagers. The Armenians, as they had in previous times of trouble, sought refuge in their churches and schools. There were six Armenian Apostolic, three Armenian Evangelical churches and one Catholic cathedral. Some, who had fled St. Stephen's before it was put to the torch, sought shelter in the Franciscan monastery, while others still hid in a soap factory, subsisting on stores of dried fruits, tarhana and olive oil for several days before the Turks reached them.The Lions of Marash (1973) Kerr p. 122. The American relief hospital came under fire on January 22nd.\\"Eyewitness Tells How Armenians were Massacred.\\" The New York Times. 29 February 1920. The Armenian legionnaires attempted to put up a defense but were ultimately overwhelmed. All the churches and eventually the entire Armenian districts were put to flames. Mur√©, Materne (1921). Un √©pisode de la trag√©die arm√©nienne: le massacre de Marache (f√©vrier 1920). Brussels: Soci√©t√© Belge de Libraire.The Lions of Marash (1973) Kerr p. 142.Sahakyan. Turkish-French Relations, pp. 150‚Äì52. The plight of the Armenians was only exacerbated when the French decided to pull out on 10 February. When the 2,000 Armenians who had taken shelter in the Catholic cathedral attempted to follow the retreat, they were cut down by Turkish rifle and machine gun fire. Aftermath At the London Conference in February 1920 the Allied Supreme Council, which at the time was working out the details to a peace treaty that it would present to the Ottoman government, were amazed by news of the defeat of the French army and the massacre of the Armenians at Marash. The French High Command however did not publicly indicate that anything serious had taken place. Internally, however, they were astonished by this move launched by the Turkish Nationalists. The battle and the massacre were discussed fervently in the European and American press, as well as the British Parliament.Parliament, House of Commons. The Parliamentary Debates. vol. 125. 5th series. London: H.M. Stationery Office, 1918‚Äì20, cols. 1958‚Äì71, 2060‚Äì62. Lloyd George was concerned that Atat√ºrk's army of regulars existed, blaming poor military intelligence. Colonel Normand's role in ordering the evacuation, in particular, stirred controversy as members of General Dufieux's staff maintained that no evacuation order had ever been given. Dufieux, however, was inexplicably told by senior commander and General of the Army of the Levant Henri Gouraud that he should let the matter drop.Sahakyan. Turkish-French Relations, pp. 153‚Äì56. French Colonel √âdouard Br√©mond, the chief administrator of the occupation zone, reflected on the decision in his memoirs: A few years later, he stated frankly, \\"Colonel Normand did not bring an order for the evacuation; he gave it [emphasis in the original].\\" In his own analysis of the conflict, the American relief worker Stanley E. Kerr attributes the withdrawal inter alia to the untenable position the French military itself had assumed, its failure to provide adequate supplies to its men, and its inability to carry out intelligence work.The Lions of Marash (1973) Kerr pp. 194-95 In Constantinople, Allied military representatives pushed to threaten the Ottoman government for the affair, while the French simultaneously explored the possibility of reaching a modus vivendi with Atat√ºrk. The Allied Supreme Council deliberated on how best to respond; some of the delegates present, including Lloyd-George, insisted that strong pressure should be brought to bear against the Ottoman government to prevent new atrocities. Other diplomats were sceptical of the idea.Documents on British Foreign Policy, vol. 7, pp. 291‚Äì99, 306. The officials also agreed that the Ottoman government should dismiss Atat√ºrk from office, although they admitted that such a move was impractical, since the Ottoman government held no control over Atat√ºrk, who was leading a counter Turkish government in Anatolia.Documents on British Foreign Policy, vol. 7, pp. 411‚Äì23. Despite objections made by the British War Office, a decision was finally reached on 10 March. British, French and Italian leaders agreed to authorize the formal occupation of Constantinople, which was carried out by the forces under General George F. Milne's command on the morning of 16 March. The decision was carried out Hovannisian (1996). pp. 43-48.

Soon after he became a Fellow of that house and was promoted to the degree of Master of Arts in 1549.

In the same year, Queen Elizabeth ascended the throne of England, and efforts were made by the Church of England party at Cambridge to gain recruits to its ranks, but Baily refused to conform to Anglicanism. As a consequence, he was deprived of his Mastership. He next visited Louvain, where he remained until 30 January 1576, during the interval receiving the degree of Doctor of Divinity. From Louvain he went to the English College, Douai, at the invitation of William Allen (afterwards Cardinal), during whose absence he usually filled the position of President of the English College, both while it was at Douai and later while it was in Reims.
