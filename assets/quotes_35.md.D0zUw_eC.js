The estate is owned by Michael Brockenhuus-Schack and has been owned by members of the Schack/Brockenhuus-Schack family since 1736. The oldest part of the main building was built in 1751 for countess Anna Sophie Schack but it was later heightened with an extra storey in 1847 and adapted in 1873 and again in 1904. It now appears as a two-storey, white-plastered building with two octagonal towers and black-glazed tile roofs. The estate covers 3,115 hectares of land. History 1668‚Äì1719: The Giesegaard family A village named Skivede was until the 1670s located where Giesegaard stands today. It belonged to the crown until 1668 when Frederick IV ceded it to Frederik Gieses in exchange for land eklsewhere. Giese was originally from Husum. He also acquired other land in the area before establishing the manor of Giesegaard in 1683. After his death in 1693 Giesegaard was taken over by his widow Margrethe Elisabeth Sch√∂nbach and son Christoffer Joachim Giese. 1719‚Äì1736: Scavenius and Gabel Christian Carl Gabel Christoffer Joachim Giese died in 1719 and his mother had to cedethe estate to her debitor Christian Scavenius. In 1720, he sold it to Christian Carl Gabel. He had been appointed to Chief Secretary of War (overkrigssekret√¶r). He expanded the estate considerably through the acquisition of more land. In 1823, he fell out of facour at the court and was dismissed. He ran into economic difficulties and was, in 1726, the same year thatr he was appointed to prefect of Ribe County, forced to obtain a loan from countess Anna Sophie Schack. 1736‚Äìpresent: The Schack family Anna Sophie Schack In 1736, Anna Sophie Schack took over Giesegaard when Gabel was unable to pay his debts. She founded Stamhuset Gieasegaard in her will with the effect that the land could not be sold or divided between heirs. The land was heavily mortgaged and Stamhuset Gieasegaard could therefore not be established until 1766. Christian Frederik Schack, the son of Otto Didrik Schack and Anna Ernestine Frederikke f√∏dt Gabel, inherited the estate in 1760. Knud Bille Schack, inherited Stamhuset Gieasegaard in 1790. He died on a journey to Karlsruhe in 1821 and GGieasegaard was then passed on to his nephew, Henrik Adolph Brockenhuus-Schack, who was created a count the following year. Giesegaard on a drawing by Ferdinand Richardt from 1853 Giesegaard after the 1873 adaption Brockenhuus-Schac's son Knud Bille Brockenhuus-Schack inherited Gieasegaard in 1847. His son, Adolph Ludvig Brockenhuus-Schack, became the owner of Gieasegaard in 1892. Stamhuset Giesegaard was dissolved in 1922 as a result of lansafl√∏sningloven of 1919. √Üarge areas of land was also ceded to the state and divided into smallholdings. Frederik Knud Bille Brockenhuus- Schack inherited the remaining part of the estate in 1924. Architecture A one-storey main building was built for countess Anna Sophie Schack in 1750-51\\\\. It was heightened with an extra storey in 1843. Both sides of the building feature a triangular pediment. The building was in 1873 adapted to the Renaissance Revival style by Theodor Zeltner. He constructed two copper- clad towers, changed the roof and added sandstone decorations. The building was restored under supervision of the architect G. Tvede in 1904. Most of the decorations were removed and the walls were dressed. Most of the associated farm buildings are from 1902 Today Gieasegaard covers 3115 hectares of which 1,013 hectares is farmland and 1,499 us woodland.¬¥Ub April 2017, DR estimated the value of the estate to DKK 330 million.

It is the successor to 1997's Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo, and features playable characters from various Capcom franchises.http://toucharcade.com/2017/11/20/puzzle-fighter-release-date/ The game launched in November 2017 and was discontinued in July 2018. Gameplay Based on the 1997 arcade title Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo, Puzzle Fighter is a competitive puzzle game in which players fight against each other using characters from Street Fighter and other Capcom franchises such as Darkstalkers, Dead Rising, and Mega Man. Each player uses one main character and can also equip two backup characters who can perform support actions. During gameplay, colored gems drop down from the top of the grid and can be rotated and placed by the player. By connecting multiple gems of the same color together into square or rectangle formations, they can merge into larger gems. Players attack their opponent and clear their grid by using Crash Gems, which destroy all connected gems of the same color upon contact. Successful crashes deals damage to the opponent and sends them Counter Gems, which turn into regular Gems after the timer counts down unless a Crash is made next to them. More damage can be done by either crashing larger gems or performing chains of successive crashes. Additionally, there are diamonds that destroy all gems of the color it lands on. Unique to this version is the Super Gauge, which can be built up with successful crashes or by placing the diamond on an empty space on the floor. When the gauge is full, players can perform a powerful Super Attack with their character. Extra damage is dealt to the player if they become overstacked and cannot place any more gems down, although this does not instantly defeat them like in the original game. Players win by reducing their opponent's health to zero. The game is divided into two modes of play; Online Matches against human opponents through an internet connection, and Missions against computer opponents. By playing through each mode, players receive one of three main kinds of rewards; coins, gems, and skill cards, as well as additional characters and costumes. Coins and skill cards are used to increase each character's abilities, such as special moves that trigger when certain patterns are crashed. When players have enough skill cards and coins, they can upgrade these abilities, which also increases the character's experience and raises their level, making them more powerful. Gems serve as the main in-game currency, allowing players to purchase certain items or skip wait times, and additional gems can be purchased with real money.http://toucharcade.com/2017/11/20/puzzle-fighter- release-date/ Characters The following characters were released up to the point of discontinuation. *Ryu (Street Fighter) *Ken Masters (Street Fighter) *Chun-Li (Street Fighter) *E.

Early life Sherburne was born 18 September 1618 in Goldsmith Rents, Cripplegate, London, the son of another Sir Edward Sherburne (1578‚Äì1641), a civil servant and secretary of the East India Company, and his wife, Frances (1588-1673), a daughter of John Stanley of Roydon Hall, Essex. His father, a descendant of the Sherburnes of Stonyhurst, had moved from Oxford to London to be employed as agent to Sir Dudley Carleton (later Viscount Dorchester), then from 1617-21 as secretary to Nicholas Bacon (Lord Keeper), as secretary of the East India Company from 1621, and finally as Clerk of the Ordnance of the Tower of London from 1626. The younger Edward was tutored first under Thomas Farnaby and later Charles Alleyn, until the latter's death in 1640. Thereupon he attempted an abortive tour of France and Italy, returning in late 1641 upon the news of the grave illness of his father, who died in December 1641. He succeeded his father as Clerk of the Ordnance, having obtained the reversion of that office in 1637-1638. Civil War Due to his staunch royalist and Roman Catholic views, Sherburne was removed as Clerk of the Ordnance by order of the House of Lords at the outbreak of the civil war. For the following months he was prisoner in the custody of the usher of the black rod until his release in October of that year, whereupon he joined the forces of the king at Oxford. On the surrender of Oxford, in June 1646, he moved to London to live in Middle Temple with his kinsman Thomas Povey. He also asserted, in petitioning for compensation in 1661, that he 'kept the train of ordnance together, to serve as a troop in the field in the decline of the late king's cause* and preserved the ordnance records, so that it is now restored to its primitive order and constitution'. Now living in near poverty‚Äîdue to the seizure of his estate and considerable library‚Äîhe obtained the acquaintance of several notable literary figures of the day, including his kinsman the author Thomas Stanley, the dramatist James Shirley, and latterly of the collector and naturalist Sir Hans Sloane. It was at this stage that he began the truly literary portion of his life, devoting a great deal of time to scholarship of the classics and publishing his first independent published works in 1648, both translations in verse of Seneca the Younger: \\"Medea, a Tragedie, written in Latine, by Lucius Ann√¶us Seneca\\" and \\"Seneca's Answer to Lucius his Qu√¶re: Why Good Men suffer Misfortunes, seeing there is a Divine Providence\\". The latter contained a dedication to the 'King of Sorrows' Charles I, then captive on the Isle of Wight, who may detect \\"\\" carefully omitting the continuing line \\"\\". Interregnum Following the execution of the king in January 1649, Sherburne moved from London, along with Thomas Stanley, staying at the country homes of the latter's relations in Cumberlow Green, Hertfordshire and Flower, Northamptonshire. His budding French and Italian scholarship, greatly encouraged by Stanley, bore fruit in his 1651 \\"Poems and Translations Amorous, Lusory, Morall, Divine\\" dedicated to Stanley. Sherburne was then enlisted as a tutor to the young Sir George Savile (later the Marquess of Halifax), and was linked at this time with the steward (of the same name) of Rufford Abbey who was involved in the Penruddock uprising. On the recommendation of Savile's mother, he was then attached as tutor to John Coventry, accompanying him on an extensive trip through \\"All France, Italy, some Part of Hungary, the Greater Part of Germany, Holland, and the Rest of the low Countries, and Flandres, returning Home about the End of October 1659\\". Post-Restoration At the Restoration Sherburne was restored to his office as Clerk of the Ordnance, and references in state papers suggest that he continued to be a diligent public servant. In this role he was principal author of the Rules, Orders, and Instructions given to the office of ordnance in 1683, which continued in use largely unaltered until the office was abolished in 1857. Near the time of the popish plot efforts were made to remove him on grounds of religion, but he was supported by the king, by whom he was granted a knighthood in 6 January 1682. At the time of the Glorious Revolution Sherburne was unable to swear the new oaths on grounds of his Roman Catholicism, and was forced to retire. As his petition to the then Master-General of the Ordnance the Earl of Romney went unanswered, it is likely he was supported in his final years by his cousin Sir Nicholas Sherburne of Stonyhurst Hall. He died on 4 November 1702 and is buried in the chapel of the Tower. Legacy Sherburne's literary reputation rests principally on his work as a translator. His poems, rare in number and largely unoriginal, serve largely to illuminate the literary fashions of the day, rather than stand as model works in their own right.

Chartered by Solomon Lewis and M. W. Kales in 1877, the Bank of Arizona was the first business in the Arizona Territory devoted exclusively to banking. The partners built a two-story structure at the southeast corner of Gurley and Cortez Streets. Soon, this building was inadequate and a new design competition was announced in January 1900 for a new building. Work commenced in August 1900. The new bank building, designed in a classical style with Second Renaissance Revival influence, reflected Prescott's prosperity, with rusticated stone and fired brick and a large column bringing attention to the corner entry. The interior featured oak paneling and patterned wallpaper. Customers included General George Crook and his wife, Governor John Fremont and his wife and many of the miners who brought in their gold to be weighed. The Bank of Arizona later became the First National Bank of Arizona, then First Interstate Bank and then Wells Fargo Bank. When Wells Fargo Bank closed the bank in 1998, it was believed to be the longest continuously operating bank in the State. This building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Next to the bank to the east is the Electric Building, built in 1898, which survived the fire of July 14, 1900. It was then used as a temporary headquarters for the Bank of Arizona, however, their safe would not fit through the door, so they left it on the sidewalk, with a guard to prevent pranksters from rolling it down Elk's Hill. The Electric Building was built in a Victorian Melange style with a large oriel window decorated with swags, recessed panels and a bracketed cornice. It is the only building of its kind in Prescott. Funded by the City of Prescott --  Bashford Block   NW corner of Gurley and Cortez streets   Bashford Block Originally this was the site of A.G. Dunn's Butcher Shop, which provided fresh locally grown beef from Dunn's ranch. This was followed by Hubbard's drug store, which was later owned by W.W.Ross, who established the Corner Drug Store. The drug store was purchased by Harry Brisley in 1899. Brisley's carried a variety of medicines, medical supplies, prescription drugs, stationery, soap and perfumes. Their most popular item was the picture post card, first introduced to Prescott by Harry Brisley. After the fire of July 14, 1900, the local newspaper reported on August 17, 1900 that \\"Architect Kilpatrick is preparing plans and specifications for a two-story building to cover the entire lot...\\" which would be constructed of brick and tufa stone. The large columns at the Cortez Street entrance were cut of locally quarried blue granite. In 1932 the Eagle Drug Store, formerly Brisley's opened a lunch counter, where many local girls waitressed their way through high school. The Eagle served as the crossroads of the community and the place to hear all of the local news. The lunch counter closed in 1974 after serving thousands of 5 cent cups of \\"the best coffee in town.\\" Funded by the Historic Preservation Fund and the City of Prescott --  Bashford Burmister Company   NE corner of Gurley and Montezuma streets   Bashford Burmister Company Coles Bashford arrived in Prescott in 1864 and was the first President of the Territorial Legislature. In 1874, Coles, his brother Levi, and son William formed a partnership with Robert Burmister. The Bashford-Burmister Company became one of the largest mercantile stores in northern Arizona, selling everything from mining supplies to fresh vegetables. Bashford advertised that his was the only store in Arizona that received goods directly from New York City. The original structure burned in the fire of 1900. This brick building, built after the fire, was enlarged and remodeled in an Art Deco style in 1929. In the 1940s, J.C. Penney replaced the Bashford-Burmister Company at this location. Renovated for use as an atrium mall in 1994, it once again serves as one of the commercial focal points of the downtown area. Funded by the Historic Preservation Fund and the City of Prescott --  Buckey O'Neill VFW Post 541   200 N Arizona Avenue   VFW Bucky O'Neill Post No. 541 Founded in Jan. 1921 and named after the famous Rough Rider William \\"Bucky\\" O'Neill, the post is the oldest active VFW post in Arizona. Born Feb. 2, 1860 in St. Louis, Missouri, his many accomplishments include being a Lawyer, Judge, Sheriff, Editor of 3 newspapers and Mayor of Prescott, Az. He was killed in action July 1, 1898 in the battle for San Juan Hill, Cuba. On his grave at Arlington it is written \\"Who would not die for a new star on the flag\\" --  The Carnegie Library   125 East Gurley Street   The Carnegie Library Prescott's first library consisted of over 300 volumes brought to the territory in 1864 by Secretary of State Richard C. McCormick. In 1870, a group of local women opened a reading room with 263 books collected from local citizens and out-of- town newspapers. Run by private parties, this was the only source of library material. In 1895 the Women's Club of Prescott (later known as the \\"Monday Club\\") was formed. Their dream was to establish a free library \\"as attractive as an evening resort\\". In June, 1899, Prescott Monday Club member Julia Goldwater wrote a letter to Andrew Carnegie requesting funds for a free library. Carnegie offered half the sume requested with the understanding that first the matching $4,000 had to be raised in the community. Eventually, the funds were raised and a building lot was granted. But the fire of July 14, 1900, destroyed all of the books for the library. The ladies of the Monday Club pressed on, accepting the donation of replacement books for the library. The Prescott Public Free Library (Carnegie Library), located here on the southwest corner of Gurley and Marina Streets, finally opened on November 24, 1903. Built in a Classical Revival style of brick and stone with a symmetrical facade, a pediment over the main entry door and a beautiful arched window above the entry, it is typical of the traditional styles being built in Prescott in the early 20th century. This library served the Prescott community until 1974, when the current City of Prescott library opened. Funded by the Historic Preservation Fund and the City of Prescott --  Citizens Cemetery   800 East Sheldon Street   Citizens Cemetery Citizens Cemetery was founded in early June 1864 with the burial of Colorado legislator Joel Woods. Established on public land east of Prescott and southwest of Fort Whipple, the cemetery has been known at various times as \\"Town Cemetery\\", \\"City Cemetery\\", \\"Prescott Cemetery\\", and \\"Citizen's Burying Ground\\". The name \\"Citizen's Cemetery\\" first appeared in print in January 1872. The United States deeded the land to Virginia Koch in 1876. After her death, it was purchased by T.W. Otis and George Tinker and their wives. On October 13, 1884, the land was transferred to Yavapai County. Burial lots were \\"leased\\" for 99 years at a cost of $2.50. Interments continued on a regular basis until 1933. The cemetery contains the graves of more than 2,500 persons and approximately 600 markers. Citizens Cemetery is populated with a wide spectrum of individuals who settled and developed central Arizona during the late 19th and early 20th century. In 1934, a Civil Works Administration project resulted in the construction of an uncoursed fieldstone and concrete masonry wall which enclosed the 6-1/2 acre cemetery. By that time, the entrance to the cemetery had been moved from the south end to the north end. Later, the north wall was demolished for the widening of Sheldon Street. A new stone wall topped by a fence and a new entry were construction in 2000. Citizens Cemetery is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Funded by the City of Prescott --  City Jail and Firehouse   117 West Goodwin Street  City Jail and Firehouse This Romanesque/Classical Revival building was constructed in 1895 and served as both a fire station (on the first floor) and the City jail (on the second). It is one of the two buildings facing the Courthouse Plaza that survived the fire of 1900. After construction of a new fire station and jail, the building saw various uses and was heavily stuccoed, covering many of its original features. Careful restoration in 1980 revealed the excellent tufa stone work that was quarried locally. Funded by the Historic Preservation Fund and the City of Prescott --  City Park and Ballfield  thumb  NE corner of Gurley and Washington streets   City Park and Ballfield, Now Ken Lindley Field has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places by the United States Department of the Interior --  Curtis Hall, Curtis Duplex and Curtis Cottages (original location)   125 South McCormick Street  Site of Curtis Hall/Curtis Duplex & Curtis Cottages George W. Curtis came to Prescott from California in 1864, and in 1867 purchased an interest in a sawmill. He purchased a building on Granite Creek on South McCormick Street, and he and his brother John enlarged and modified the building in 1878. This building was known as Curtis Hall and was used as the meeting place for the Territorial Legislature from 1879 to early 1885 and as City Hal. Curtis Hall was described as a \\"mammoth frame house\\" which \\"overshadows every edifice in town\\". This building was apparently gone by the mid-1880s at which time the Curtis Duplex was built at the same location. The Curtis Duplex appears in an 1885 photograph of Prescott. It was a one-story wood frame building with a porch across the front, covered with shiplap siding. It was an unusual example of multi-family housing, circa 1880. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Around 1881, the Curtis brothers also built three \\"cottages\\" along South McCormick Street to the north and south of the Curtis Duplex. These early Territorial frame cottages were a good example of blue- collar housing in Prescott in the 1880s. Although greatly modified, one of these cottages still stands at 125 South McCormick Street and is listed in the National Register or Historic Places. The Curtis Duplex and their other two cottages were demolished in 1988. Funded by the City of Prescott --  The Day Octagon   212 East Gurley Street  The Day Octagon The Day Octagon is the oldest known fired brick building in Arizona. Built in 1877 by Lowell and Crouch for Dr. Warren E. Day, it is significant as the first surgical hospital in Arizona Territory, where Dr. Day pulled teeth, delivered babies, fitted eyeglasses and cared for the community's other medical needs. It embodies many of the features described by Orson Fowler in his book \\"The Octagon House A Home for All\\". Fowler subscribed to the idea that the octagon was the shape most closely a sphere and was, therefore, ideal for houses. Dr. Warren E. Day was a colorful figure in the history of the Territory. His bravery and medical expertise during the Civil War gained the respect of General George Crook, who asked Day to come to Fort Verde, Arizona Territory, with him in 1873. In 1876 Day came to Prescott to establish a medical practice. He married a widow, Bridget Cordon in 1880. They had ten children. Dr. Day continued to practice in the area until the 1920s. The rectangular portion of the Day Octagon was added in 1888. The building was later used as a commercial laundry and as offices. The Day Octagon was completely restored in 1987 and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. --  The Ehle Family and the Montezuma Hotel   NW corner of Montezuma and Willis streets   The Ehle Family and the Montezuma Hotel Joseph and Margaret Ehle arrived in Prescott, Arizona Territory, on July 13, 1864 with their children, John Henry, Mary Jane, Amy E., Olive Joan, Sarah F. and Margaret Viola. Mr. Ehle helped to build the log Governor's Mansion (now part of Sharlot Hall Museum). The Ehle were the first settlers in the area to have domesticated honeybees and chickens, and Mrs. Ehle's yellow cat was worth her weight in gold, as her kittens sold for an ounce of gold, over twenty dollars apiece. Mrs. Ehle, known as \\"Grandmother Ehle\\", also brought the first sewing machine to Prescott. Their daughter, Mary Jane, was Prescott's first bride, marrying John Dickson at the Governor's Mansion with Governor Goodwin officiating. The Ehles built a log house at the southwest corner of Goodwin and Marina Streets. In the fall of 1868, they opened the Montezuma Hotel at the northwest corner of Willis and Montezuma streets where the Coronado Apartments, which were apparently built between 1910 and 1924, are today. The Arizona Miner reported on October 10, 1868 that \\"[t]his hotel is now in full blast and is crowded with guests. Mr. Ehle sets a first-class table.\\" By 1869, they had built a residence next door at 214 North Montezuma Street. The house presently at this location was built between 1890 and 1895. Mrs. Ehle died there in 1905. Joseph Ehle died in 1912 in California at the age of 98. Both are buried at the Masonic Cemetery in Prescott. --  The Fire of 1900   SW corner of Montezuma and Goodwin streets   The Fire of 1900 A disastrous fire on the night of July 14, 1900 changed the face of downtown Prescott. Starting in a room in the Scopel Hotel on the southwest corner of Goodwin and Montezuma Streets, the fire quickly hopped across Goodwin Street and proceeded to consume all of the buildings on \\"Whiskey Row\\" leveling the entire block. Though some of the Plaza buildings were built of brick, many were wood, and the destruction was nearly complete. The fire burned almost everything in its path to Granite Creek and Willis Street, a total of over 80 businesses. Prescott had suffered fires before, but this was by far the worst. The pluck and courage of its merchants and residents was evident, however, as they pitched in to rebuild, this time of more substantial means: brick, concrete, and stone. Within three days construction was underway. Undaunted merchants were open and doing a brisk business in tents, corrugated metal buildings, and hastily constructed sheds on the courthouse lawn. Of the buildings standing at the time of the fire, only a few remain: The Prescott National Bank and the Bank of Prescott (both under construction in 1900), the Knights of Pythias Building on South Cortez Street, and the City Jail and Fire Station on West Goodwin Street. Funded by the Historic Preservation Fund and the City of Prescott --  J.I. Gardner Store   NE corner of Cortez and Willis streets   J.I. Gardner Store J. I. Gardner came to Prescott with a pack train in 1879 and opened his first mercantile store in 1883. The J. I. Gardner Store was built on this corner in 1890. Gardner's motto was \\"all goods guaranteed to be first class\\". They carried every type of \\"general supply and merchandise including fresh fruit and vegetables, coffee, tea and spices, flour, sugar, canned goods, household goods, pots and pans and wallpaper, dress goods and boots, shirts, coats and hats, sheep dip, farming and ranching supplies and toys. Many customers paid in gold, but others paid in trade goods - anything of value including livestock and farm products. Gardner's even had a mail order service, with goods going by train to their destinations, many of which were in remote areas of the country. Today, the Gardner Store building has been adapted for use as a restaurant, at the same time retaining the historic appearance of the building and many of the original store fixtures. --  Goldwater Brothers Mercantile (original location)   NE corner of Union and Cortez streets  Site of Goldwater Brothers Mercantile The Goldwater Brothers, Morris and Michael, arrived in Arizona from California in 1876. They opened one of the area's first general merchandising stores on the southeast corner of Cortez and Goodwin (where City Hall is now located). Three years later they built a new, larger establishment on this site. A leading citizen of early Prescott, Morris served as mayor from 1879-1880, 1894-1897, 1905-1913, and 1919-1927. Both of the Goldwater homes in Prescott are still standing, and one is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. In 1964, Morris' nephew, Barry, announced his candidacy for President of the United States from the Courthouse steps across the street. A local landmark for over 100 years, the building, best known then as the \\"Studio Theater\\", was torn down in 1978. Funded by the Historic Preservation Fund and the City of Prescott --  Grace M. Sparks   854 East Gurley Street   Grace M. Sparks 1893 - 1963 There was a time when progress in Yavapai County was spelled S-P-A-R-K-E-S. Grace M. Sparkes came to Prescott, Arizona Territory, at the age of 14 in 1906. By 1911, she was working for the Yavapai County Chamber of Commerce as Secretary, a job she held for 34 years. In this capacity, and due significantly to her influence, the economy of Yavapai County remained stable through her tenure with a diverse base of tourism, health, mining, ranching and forestry. Among many other accomplishments, Miss Sparkes was the producer of the Prescott Frontier Days Rodeo for 30 years and developed the \\"Prescott Rules\\" used widely for rodeos across the West. She was involved in funding for the Hassayampa Hotel, was the publisher and editor of Yavapai Magazine, helped organize the Smoki People, and joined historian Sharlot Hall in securing a reservation for the Yavapai Indians in 1935. She worked to enlarge the Montezuma Castle National Monument and campaigned for good roads across the state. As Yavapai County Immigration Commissioner and member of the Arizona State Board of Welfare, she directed the Works Progress Administration for the County. Projects constructed under her supervision include the Sharlot Hall Building (the House of A Thousand Hands), the Hospital at Ft. Whipple, the Smoki Museum, Ken Lindley Field and Stadium, Prescott High School (now Mile High Middle School), Goldwater Dam and several street bridges. In 1945 Grace resigned her position as Secretary of the Yavapai Chamber of Commerce and moved to Cochise County. She died October 23, 1963 in Bisbee. --  Granite Creek   300 West Gurley Street   Granite Creek American History in Arizona is quite recent, although the history of the Native American, Spanish and Mexican occupation periods are much older. Encampments of Native Americans were drawn to the creeks, which offered a fairly reliable source of fresh water, and the Anglo settlers followed suit. The first known Anglo-Americans to camp in the vicinity of Prescott were the Walker and Weaver parties in 1863. The Walker Party camped on the banks of Granite Creek in what is now downtown Prescott. Granite Creek quickly became a magnet for explorers, miners and settlers, and later, farmers. Activities and development along Granite Creek included panning for minerals, particularly gold; picnicking; the location of the first store and school in Prescott and a conglomeration of shanties and lean-tos; saloons; and Chinese and Mexican settlements. Later, substantial residences along with warehouses, a gas plant, bottling works and farms were developed. among the drinking establishments was the Quartz Rock Saloon, owned by a nose-less military deserter. It sported a plank bar with two bottles of whiskey and one cup. The sight of water purportedly make the patrons sick, so the business was moved to South Montezuma Street. Local legend is that saloon patrons kept falling into Granite Creek, thus diminishing a booming business. As a result, many of the saloons moved to \\"Whiskey Row, which was safer because of its further distance from the creek. In addition to supporting human uses, Granite Creek gives life to many species of trees, shrubs, and grasses. Approximately 75 percent of our local wildlife are dependent upon Granite Creek and its tributaries. Over the last 150 years Granite Creek has seen many changes. The broad \\"gallery\\" of cottonwood and willow trees seen here was once up to a 1/4 mile in width, and it stretched from what is now downtown Prescott all the way to the Granite Dells, 5 miles to the northeast. The Granite Creek channel has been straightened, mined, filled, and built upon over time, resulting in a substantial loss of riparian habitat. In the 1990s, local organizations were formed to preserve and restore what riparian (streamside) habitat was left. The trail you can see below was the first effort toward this end. Since then, riparian habitat has been protected at West Granite Creek Park, Watson Woods Riparian Preserve, Watson & Willow Lakes, and the Yavapai-Prescott Tribal Lands. --  Head Hotel   117 North Cortez Street   Head Hotel Colonel C. P. Head was in the hardware business in Prescott by about 1866. By 1875, Colonel Head was involved in several businesses including hardware, lumber and a hotel. He served in the territorial House of Representatives from Yavapai County for the 1875‚Äì1877 term. Colonel Head was described by William A. Farish as \\"a most excellent gentleman, a business man of wealth.\\" By 1916, there were 16 hotels in Prescott, including the 80-room Head Hotel. Built by A. J. Head just after the fire of July 14, 1900, the \\"grand brick\\" hotel was 3 stories high and had pairs of windows looking out onto the street with 3 sets of balconies on the 2nd and 3rd floors. Unlike many hotels of the time, the Head hotel boasted steam heat and hot and cold water in every room. Twenty rooms had private baths. Rates were by the day, week or month. The first floor was primarily commercial, except for the lobby. The hotel offered a restaurant, floral shop, newsstand and barber shop. Business included the Post Office, Calles' Saddelry, the New State Theater, Andres' Cigar Shop and various retail stores including, in later years, J.C. Penny's. In the 1980s, the Head Hotel was extensively remodeled on the exterior and no longer has historic integrity. --  Hotel St. Michael   205 West Gurley Street   Hotel St. Michael The cornerstone of historic \\"Whiskey Row\\", the Hotel St. Michael, represents the coming of age of Prescott's hostelries. Constructed on the site of the modest Hotel Burke, which burned in 1900, the new three-story hotel was designed by D. W. Millard in the Second Renaissance Revival style. Built of brick and stone, it is decorated with stone faces or \\"gargoyles\\", which allegedly represent crude images of local politicians. Opened June 1, 1901, the hotel offered \\"gracious accommodations\\" and the most advanced amenities of the era. Significantly, the hotel has hosted many distinguished visitors, including President Theodore Roosevelt, John L. Sullivan, Jake Kilrain, Tom Mix, Zane Grey, Senator Barry Goldwater. The Hotel St. Michael is an excellent example of early twentieth century western style accommodations in Prescott and today presents a reminder of Prescott's colorful historic past. Funded by the Historic Preservation Fund and the City of Prescott --  Hotel Vendome   230 South Cortez Street   Hotel Vendome The Hotel Vendome, referred to in a contemporary newspaper article as an \\"apartment house\\", was built on South Cortez Street in 1917 by J. B. Jones. An article in Yavapai Magazine in November 1917 refers to it as the \\"Hotel Vendome\\" and states \\"its construction will fill a need for housing in the town which was crucial even when the summer visitors were induced to return home.\\" The hotel is constructed of dark red wire-cut brick with a traditional brick cornice. A two-story veranda extends across the front of the building. It is the only Prescott example of a two-story structure built exclusively for residential use during the first quarter of the Twentieth Century. The Hotel Vendome was advertised as an \\"attractive small hotel with 30 rooms and 16 baths, wide verandas upstairs and down, attractive lobby, hot and cold water in all rooms, night and day phone service with buzzers in all rooms, excellent steam heat, free parking, one- half block from the Plaza, one block east of Highway 89, rates are reasonable with $1.50 single and $2.50 double\\". One of the Hotel Vendome's more famous guests was Tom Mix, who rented a room by the year. The Hotel Vendome was restored and modernized in 1983 and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. --  Howey's Hall (original location)   201 South Cortez Street   Site of Howey's Hall The southeast corner of Goodwin and Cortez Street was the site of Howey's Hall, which was built on the first lot sold (for $175) in Prescott by James Howey in 1876. The Goldwaters had their first mercantile store here. It was later converted to an opera house \\"dedicated to mirth and dancing\\". It was a secondhand store when the City purchased it in 1904 for a fire station. Howey's Hall was demolished in 1959, replaced by today's City Hall. Funded by the Historic Preservation Fund and the City of Prescott --  Knights of Pythias Building   105 South Cortez Street   Knights of Pythias Building With the exception of the Courthouse, the Knights of Pythias Building, also known as the Tilton Building, has always been the tallest building on the Plaza at 46 feet. It was dedicated on November 27, 1895, and is one of the few buildings that survived the fire of 1900. The building originally housed retail on the first floor, office space on the second floor, and a large open hall on the third floor as the meeting room of the Knights of Pythias, an early social fraternal organization attended by many of Prescott's leading male citizens. Scorched in the fire, the front facade was stuccoed and scored to resemble stone. The building was partially restored in 1995. Funded by the Historic Preservation Fund and The City of Prescott\\" --  Lincoln School   201 Park Avenue   Lincoln School In early 1908, the Prescott School Board decided that a new school was needed in Prescott. On July 12, 1908, a school bond election was held and approved by the voters 119‚Äì1. In August 1908, the three-acre site on Park Avenue on the west side of town was selected because it \\"was becoming increasingly popular as a residential area\\". The school was designed in a traditional style with Neo-Classical influences by architect W. S. Elliott and was to be constructed of red brick. A contract with Clinton Campbell was approved for $19,480. In late 1909, the north building of Lincoln School opened its doors. The first principal was Glenn Persons, who was also the principal of Washington School. The first full-time principal was Miss Piper. In 1930, Prescott schools were bursting at the seams, and Lincoln School, which was designed to accommodate 200 students, had an enrollment of 420. By that time, the west side of Prescott was \\"an established residential area growing larger by the day\\" and the decision was made to build an additional building on the southern portion of the campus at Lincoln School This building, too, was designed in a traditional style with Neo-Classical influences. This building was later expanded and in 1990 the multipurpose building which was designed by William Otwell, was constructed. In 1999 Lincoln School held its 90th birthday celebration, with many former teachers and students in attendance. Part of the celebration included a May Pole Dance, a Lincoln School tradition, and a flag ceremony. As Prescott's second elementary school, Lincoln School holds an important place in the history of the community. Lincoln School is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. --  Montezuma Street   100 South Montezuma Street   Montezuma Street The one hundred block of South Montezuma Street has long been known as \\"Whiskey Row\\" for the numerous saloons which once lined the street. As Prescott poet Gail Gardner once wrote of \\"Whiskey Row\\": \\"Oh they starts her in at the Kaintucky bar, At the head of Whiskey Row, And they winds up down by the Depot House, Some forth drinks below.\\" On July 14, 1900 this block was totally destroyed by fire. Within a few days of the fire, new construction was underway in brick and masonry. Most of the buildings on this block were constructed between the fall of 1900 and 1905 and include Sam'l Hill Hardware Company, the Highland Hotel, the Palace, the Levey Building and the Hotel St. Michael. All of these buildings are constructed with permanence and appearance in mind in styles typical of early 20th century buildings. Some buildings were architecturally progressive, such as Sam'l Hill Hardware Company, or architecturally outstanding such as the Palace and the Hotel St. Michael. All preset a united front to the Courthouse Plaza, resulting in a unique turn-of-the century facade which is essentially intact today. --  Mulvenon Building   227 W Gurley Street   Mulvenon Building Completed in August 1901, the Mulvenon Building was one of the first buildings constructed after the fire of 1900. It replaced a one-story wood- frame saloon building which was destroyed in the fire. Built by William J. Mulvenon, who arrived in Prescott in 1876, it is typical of the late 19th Century Territorial Commercial style with a prominent central arch over the main entrance. It is constructed of locally made brick, although the brick on the front of the building is of better quality than the brick in the rest of the building. Originally there were two retail bays on the ground floor and hotel rooms on the second floor. The west half of the building at one time housed \\"Prescott Vulcanizing Works\\" and the east half was a saloon. Rooms were available for rent until 1991. In 1991 the building was restored and converted into a bar and restaurant. W.J. Mulvenon originally worked as a stablekeeper at Peck's mine. He later served as deputy sheriff and as sheriff of Yavapai County, leading two posses into Tonto Basin to restore law and order during the Pleasant Valley War. He was instrumental in establishing the Crystal Ice Company, the first ice plant in Prescott and was organizer of the Arizona Brewing Company. The Mulvenon Building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. --  Nob Hill   SE corner of Union and Marina streets   East Union Street Originally a part of the Capital Block, which was set aside in 1864 for a Territorial Capitol Building, the south half of the block was sold at auction. John Lawler, a miner, capitalist and real estate developer, bought the entire block and built a \\"double house\\" on the east end of the block. The Lawler House is unique because it is one structure containing two houses divided down the middle from front to back along the lot line. It is also very plain, with none of the typical features of the popular Victorian architecture of the day. Between 1893 and 1899 he sold lots to three others, based on their financial and social status to create a San Francisco style \\"Nob Hill\\" district overlooking the town from the top of the hill. Homes were built by Henry Goldwater, C.A. Peter and Jake Marks. The Henry Goldwater House at 217 E. Union, was built in 1894 in a Victorian Melange style. A conical roof on the southwest corner suggests a turret even though none actually exists. Goldwater was one of the brothers who founded Goldwater Mercantile Company. The C. A. Peter House at 211 E. Union was the last one to be built on the block. It is a Queen Ann interpretation of the Victorian style and is one of the most significant Victorians in Prescott. Mr Peter was a cashier at the Bank of Arizona when he built the house in 1989. Jake Marks built his house in 1894. Although he was a wealthy cattle rancher and mine owner, he was also a wholesale liquor dealer, and Lawler would only sell him the last or \\"lowest\\" lot on the block. The Marks House at 203 E. Union is also a Queen Anne interpretation of the Victorian style, which includes a turet on the southwest corner of the house. All of these houses have been restored to varying extents and all are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. --  O'Neill/Munds House (original location)   420 E Sheldon Streey   O'Neill/Munds House A beautiful Victorian Cottage which faced East Sheldon Street was built on this site by W.B. Jones. On November 15, 1893, William Owen (Buckey) O'Neill and his wife Pauline moved into the house. O'Neill used a portion of the upstairs as his office where he published his livestock newspaper, \\"Hoof and Horn\\". O'Neill, who came to Arizona in 1879 at the age of 19, met his future wife, Pauline Marie Schindler, in Prescott in 1885. They were married on April 27, 1886. Two days later, \\"Buckey\\" O'Neill announced his marriage to Pauline in \\"Hoof and Horn\\" with a passionate essay on the joys of the \\"Beulah land of matrimony\\". O'Neill, who by 1888 had been elected Probate Judge and then Sheriff of Yavapai County, was later elected Mayor of the City of Prescott. Pauline, too, earned political appointments which reflected her interests in suffrage and prohibition. Roughrider Captain William \\"Buckey\\" O'Neill was killed in Sangtiago, Cuba on July 1, 1898. Pauline, who was elected to the Arizona House of Representatives in 1917, sold the house to John and Frances Munds in 1902. John Lee Munds and Frances (\\"Fannie\\") Lillian Willard Munds were both from Arizona ranching families. Munds was Sheriff of Yavapai County. Fannie Munds worked tirelessly for women's suffrage, and the right to vote in Arizona was granted on November 15, 1912. Fannie Munds was the first woman elected to such a position in the nation. The O'Neill/Munds House later burned and was demolished. --  The Palace Saloon   120 South Montezuma Street   The Palace Saloon The exact age of Prescott's Palace Saloon is something of a puzzle. The first reliable documentation is an item from the September 21, 1877 Arizona Weekly Miner: \\"Mess'rs Shaw and Standefer have fitted up the Palace Saloon in the most superb style and fitted it with choice liquors of every conceivable kind.\\" An 1883 fire destroyed most of \\"The Row\\", including the Palace. Owner Robert Brow rebuilt in brick, with a stone foundation and iron roof. The interior featured a 20-foot-long bar and beautiful back-bar, which had been shipped by boat and freight wagon to Prescott, three gaming tables and two club rooms. On July 14, 1900, much of downtown Prescott burned to the ground, including the \\"fireproof\\" Palace Saloon. Patrons managed to salvage much of the liquor and the bar, all taken across the street to the Plaza, where drinks were served as the fire progressed. After the fire, Robert Brow and the owners of the Cabinet Saloon pooled their interests and determined to build \\"the finest and best club house, saloon, caf√©, etc. that Arizona has ever had, or in fact that can be found west of the Mississippi River\\". The new Palace Hotel, designed in the Neo-Classical Revival style, took over the front page of the June 29, 1901 Prescott Journal Miner. It was the most elegant pleasure resort along \\"The Row\\". The Miner described the interior furnishings as \\"rich and elegant\\" with only the best materials used. The bar and fixtures were described as \\"the crowning features of the furnishings\\" and \\"without doubt the most elegant in this part of the country\\". Three large gaming tables encouraged faro, poker, roulette, kino and craps. A glass of beer was five cents, and a man could pay for his drinks with unminted gold. In 1907 a State law outlawed wagering and games of change, along with their \\"attendant evils\\" and Prohibition during World War I closed many a saloon, but the Palace held on. In 1996 The Palace was closed and in severely deteriorated condition when restoration began. Working from old photographs, the elegance of the Palace Hotel and Saloon of 1901 was recaptured. The Palace is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Funded by the City of Prescott --  Plaza Bandstand   Courthouse Plaza   Plaza Bandstand As early as 1865, Lucian Bonaparte Jewell organized a Brass Band in Prescott, but by the 1870s the regimental bands from Ft. Whipple began to dominate the local music scene. The original Plaza Bandstand, built in the late 1800s, had survived the fire of 1900, but was eventually removed. On July 8, 1908, The Prescott Brass Band was reorganized and showed interest in erecting a permanent ornamental Bandstand on the Plaza. It was not until May, 1910, that Henry Rockmark was awarded the contract for construction of the new Bandstand for the sum of $1,150.00. The Summer of 1910 was a special time for the AZ Territory with the passage of the statehood bill by the US Congress, June 19, 1910. Territorial Governor Richard E. Sloan was the honored guest for the Statehood and Fourth of July celebration several weeks later. From the new Bandstand, the Prescott Concert Band, in their handsome new uniforms from the East, struck up the tune \\"Hail to the Chief\\" and the Governor delivered the dedication address for the planting of the Statehood Tree. This was the first official ceremony from the new Bandstand. The Bandstand pre-dates the present Courthouse and has been the site for weddings, Sunday schools, and Christmas ornamentations. It remains much as it was constructed in 1910, with the exception of the original wood railings which were replaced with iron railings. In celebration of the Plaza Bandstand Centennial. Granite Mountain Questers - 2010. --  Prescott   101 West Goodwin Street   Prescott Founded in 1864 on Granite Creek, early source of placer gold. Former territorial capital of Arizona. Now a center for ranching, mining, health, especially asthma relief. Located here on site of old Ft. Whipple is Whipple Veterans Hospital. Seat of First Governor's Mansion, and Arizona Pioneer's Home. Frontier Days, oldest rodeo in West, began here. Erected by Prescott Rotary Club --  Prescott's Beginnings: The First Mining District in Yavapai County   150 South Montezuma Street   Prescott The City of Prescott had its beginnings in the Spring of 1863 when a party of explorers and would-be gold miners led by the famed Joseph R. Walker arrived near the headwaters of the Hassayampa River. On May 10, 1863, at a location some six miles south-southeast of this Plaza, twenty-five members of the Walker Prospecting and Mining Company adopted \\"Laws and Resolutions\\" governing members of the first mining district in what would later become Yavapai County. The rules for the \\"Pioneer Mining District\\" provided a foundation for the establishment of mining law in the central Arizona highlands, and can be considered Prescott's birth certificate. Thus began a gold rush that sparked the settlement and development of central Arizona, and the choice of Prescott as the first Territorial Capital. Before then, this area was almost totally unknown to white men, and gold mining prospects had been known only along the Colorado and Gila Rivers. Joseph R. Walker led this group of explorers and miners on an expedition that started in California and went through portions of Northern Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico before ending here two years later. John W. (Jack) Swilling joined the party in New Mexico and then guided them to where he had seen significant indication of gold three years earlier. The other twenty-three members of the \\"Original Prospectors\\" listed in their organizational document were: Joseph R. Walker, Jr., John Dickson, Jacob Linn, Jacob Miller, James V. Wheelhouse, Frank Finney, Sam Miller, George Blosser, A. C. Benedict, S. Shoup, T. J. Johnson, Daniel Ellis (Conner), Abner French, Charles Taylor, H. B. Cummings, William Williams, G. Gillalan, Jackson McCrackin, Rodney McKinnon, Felix Cholet, M. Lewis, James Chase, and George Coulter. When the company was officially disbanded six months later, Captain Walker noted with satisfaction that: \\"We opened the door and held it open to civilization and now civilization will do the rest.\\" Sidebar One: Jack W. (Jack) Swilling (1830 - 1878) led the first party of non-Indians to explore the Hassayampa River in January 1860 where he and his companions declared that \\"this new region has the finest indications of gold of any they have ever seen.\\" In 1867 Swilling began the first canal building company in the Salt River Valley, leading to the beginnings of Phoenix and surrounding communities. Sidebar Two: Joseph R. Walker, (1798 - 1876) played a dramatic half-century role in the opening of the American West; beginning as a fur trader and trapper, then as an explorer and guide, he was one of the great pathfinders across the unknown portions of the United States. This famous frontiersman was on his last great adventure \\"into the only unknown section of the United States\\" when he led a party of fortune seekers to this undeveloped area. --  Prescott High School and the Yavapai Club   SW corner of Gurley and Alarcon streets  Prescott High School and the Yavapai Club Three very prominent buildings once stood on East Gurley Street between Alarcon and Marina Streets - The Territorial Capital Building, Prescott High School and the Yavapai Club. Originally, the property between Alarcon and Marina streets on Gurley Street was the site of the red brick building which housed the Territorial Legislature and Prescott City Hall. Built in 1884, it was remodeled in 1904 for use as a high school. In 1914, it was demolished and a new high school was constructed. The new high school was described as \\"splendid\\". By 1930, this was too small for the number of students, so in 1931 a junior high school was added on the east and south sides of the block. Meanwhile, in 1903 railroad entrepreneur Frank Murphy purchased the building along South Marina Street at Gurley. The Dake Opera House, the Goldsworthy Residence and the Gould Cottage were demolished to build the Yavapai Club, an organization \\"incorporated by the businessmen of the county for the purpose of furthering the material and social interest of the community\\". It was housed in \\"one of the finest buildings in Arizona and was as completely equipped as the finest gentleman's club in San Francisco or New York\\". The club featured a library, games room, restaurant with a buffet, a bowling alley, sleeping accommodations and a second-floor ballroom. After a fire in 1907, the Club was restored. It was eventually turned over to the high school in the 1930s and was used for art classes and a music room. It was torn down about 1941. In 1976, the entire block was cleared for the construction of a new Yavapai County Administration complex. --  Prescott National Bank   NE corner of Gurley and Cortez streets  Prescott National Bank The Prescott National Bank was organized by William Bashford, R.N. Fredericks and others in March, 1893. In October, 1900 Bank President Frank N. Murphy announced the construction of a new bank building on the \\"Old Wooster Block\\" at Prescott's \\"banking intersection\\" of Gurley and Cortez. The building was completed in January, 1902. Constructed of yellow brick with stone accents, idendical entrances on Gurley and Cortez Streets are each flanked by two sets of blue granite columns. The bank closed its doors on November 15, 1920. In 1922, Valley Bank consolidated with the First National Bank of Arizona and moved into the building. The use of this building as a bank ceased in 1957 when the building was converted to retail use. In 1998 the building changed hands for the first time in decades and was restored for use as professional offices. Funded by the Historic Preservation Fund and the City of Prescott --  Prescott National Guard Armory   824 East Gurly Street   Prescott National Guard Armory Prescott was one of the first towns in Arizona to have a National Guard Unit. Companies B and C of the First Territorial Rifles were organized in Prescott in 1865 and Company M of the First Arizona Infantry was organized in 1910. Company M of the 158th Infantry of the National Guard of Arizona received Federal recognition February 3, 1930. This Company originally used a church on South Montezuma Street as their Armory, but it was described as \\"totally inadequate\\". The Prescott National Guard Armory, one of the largest and most prominent buildings on East Gurley Street, was designed by architect Orville A. Bell and was constructed on land donated to the State of Arizona by the City of Prescott. This was a portion of the property previously donated to the City by Mr. & Mrs. Charles T. Joslin. A Works Progress Administration (W.P.A.P) project, construction of the Armory was begun on March 5, 1936 and completed in November, 1939. The Armory was designed as a vernacular structure with elements of Richardsonian Romanesque style in the decorative detail. The building is constructed of reinforced concrete with native ashlar granite facing and sandstone trim, red or black extruded mortar joints and a Lamelia truss roof. It was described at the time of completion as \\"fortress-like\\". In July 1980 the Armory, no longer needed by the Arizona Nation Guard, was deeded to the City of Prescott. Today it is used as a multi-use City Parks and Recreation facility. The Prescott National Guard Armory is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. --  Prescott Public Library   215 East Goodwin Street   Prescott Public Library Prescott's modern public library was dedicated on May 18, 1975. However, the history of a public library in Prescott goes back to August 1895, when seven local ladies founded the Women's Club of Prescott (now the Monday Club). They gathered a collection of books from local households and opened a reading room. This venture was supported with membership dues, but the dream of the Women's Club was to establish a free reading room. In July 1899, Julia Goldwater wrote a letter to Andrew Carnegie requesting assistance. Carnegie offered $4,000, half the sum which had been requested, with the understanding that a matching amount must be raised in the community. Eventually, the funds were raised and in 1903 the Carnegie Library was completed on the southwest corner of Gurley and Marina streets. This was Prescott's public library until 1975, when the current library building was completed on the southeast corner of Marina and Goodwin streets. Prescott Public Library provides access to books, magazines and newspapers, computers and internet access, Summer Reading programs, story hours, special programs, meeting rooms and an ongoing Friends Book Sale that includes some of the original book stacks from the Carnegie Library. The Prescott Public Library is one of the most extensively used library facilities in the state, and parking is always at a premium. In 1998, in an effort to help alleviate this problem, the City acquired the adjacent property to the south, and constructed a new parking lot. One of the primary features of this property is an Arizona White Oak (Quercus Arizonica) estimated to be over 300 years old. This tree is very slow growing, may live to be 500 years old and is found at elevations of 4,900 to 11,000 feet. The parking lot was designed around the tree, enabling the City to preserve and protect the tree and leaving a small park area within the parking lot. Funded by the Bumpus Trust --  Ruffner Plaza Stables   Near 117 W Goodwin Street  Ruffner Plaza Stables The Ruffner Plaza Stables were built on this lot purchased from Frank Murphy for $3,600. In May 1898, a local newspaper reported that it was \\"one of the most substantial as well as ornamental improvements which has been put up for several years. It is said to be one of the handsomest buildings of the kind in the Southwest and far ahead of any similar structure in Arizona.\\" In February 1922, Ruffner sold the business to Dixon Fagerbert, who remodeled the building into a modern garage. The building later burned. Owner, George Ruffner (marked with an X on the photograph) was described as \\"a man of honest and respectable industry\\". He came to the Territory in 1881 and worked as a cowboy and teamster. In 1888, Ruffner was one of the organizers of Prescott's World's Oldest Rodeo and he carried the American flag in every Fourth of July parade until his death in 1933 at the age of 71. In 1893 he was appointed a Deputy Sheriff of Yavapai County and the following year was elected Sheriff. He served five non-contiguous terms and was the first person from Arizona inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners in the Cowboy Hall of Fame. This plaque was placed by the City of Prescott and Ruffner descendants at the Ruffner family reunion in June 2003. --  Sacret Heart Catholic Church and Rectory   208 North Marina Street   Sacret Heart Catholic Church and Rectory In the fall of 1878 the Sisters of St. Joseph came to Prescott. Money was raised in the community for a hospital to be run by the sisters and by 1881 the hospital had been completed on North Marina Street. In June 1891 construction was started next door on Sacred Heart Catholic Church. The church was designed by Frank Parker under the direction of Father Alfred Quetu. Fr. Quetu was the prime mover behind the building of the church. The first services were held on February 17, 1895. Sacred Heart Catholic Church is a substantial brick structure in the \\"Sober Gothic Style\\" featuring pointed arches, decorative brickwork and two colors of local rhyolitic tuff stone for trim and the foundation. It is one of the best examples of religious architecture in Arizona. Originally, the church had a steeple 115 feet tall. After being struck by lightning several times, it was removed in 1930. In 1915, the old hospital was torn down and the Rectory was built next door. A new hospital had been built on Grove Avenue in 1898, and the name was changed to Sisters of Mercy Hospital. June 13, 1969 was the last time the church was used for religious services. In 1969 the Prescott Fine Arts Association acquired the property for a theater and art gallery, an excellent example of adaptation of a historically significant building for re-use for the benefit of the community. The church and rectory are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. --  Santa Fe Depot   100 East Sheldon Street   Santa Fe Depot Prescott's first railroad arrived on December 31, 1886. The current depot was built by the Santa Fe, Prescott and Phoenix Railway, also known as the \\"Peavine\\", in 1907. Designed in the Mission Revival style of poured concrete with a barrel tile roof, it occupies a prominent location at the north end of Cortez Street and was the center of shipping and receiving in Yavapai County. The tracks were last in use on December 31, 1986, the 100th anniversary of the arrival of the railroad. The tracks were removes and the Depot, long empty, has now been restored and converted to use as professional offices. --  Territorial Capital   SE corner of Montezuma and Gurley streets   Prescott Prescott, Yavapai County seat, founded 1864 on Granite Creek, source of placer gold. Named for William Hickling Prescott, Historian. First Governor John N. Goodwin, appointee of Abraham Lincoln, established first territorial capital of Arizona here, at Governor's mansion. Two blocks west, the first legislature met July 10, 1865. Site of first graded school started in Arizona. Disastrous fire started by Miner's cancel destroyed four blocks about this square in 1900. Erected by the Prescott Rotary Club, 1959 --  Territorial Courthouse (original location)   SW corner of Cortez and Gurley streets   Site of Territorial The courthouse you see today, constructed in 1916 and listed in the National Register of Historic Places, is not the original one on this site. The first courthouse constructed on the Plaza, one of two city blocks set aside in 1864 for government use, was a smaller, but more elaborate brick structure built in 1878. It was an impressive structure that immediately became the symbolic focal point of a young Yavapai County. Many important cases were heard here in the days when Prescott served as the Territorial Capital of Arizona (1864-1867 and 1877-1889). Arizona became State in 1912, four years before the current courthouse was constructed. Funded by the Historic Preservation Fund and the City of Prescott --  Washington School   300 East Gurley Street   Washington School The first public school in Prescott was opened in 1867. In 1876 a four-room brick public school building was erected here. It was known as the \\"Prescott Free Academy\\". In 1903 that building was torn down and replaced by Washington School. Washington School was designed by D. Kilpatrick in a Classical Revival style. It was constructed of deep red brick with tuff and cement trim and \\"presents a handsome appearance from the exterior\\". The school opened on September 1, 1903. The bell from the Prescott Free Academy was hung in the belfry. In 1914 a second building was constructed northwest of the main school building for manual arts and domestic science classes. This building was torn down in 1979. A second annex building constructed in 1930 is still in use. The multi-purpose building was designed by William Otwell and was constructed in 1990. Washington School is the oldest school building in Yavapai County which has been in continuous use as a school, and may be the oldest school building in Arizona still in use as a school. A 1903 article in the Prescott Journal Miner stated that Washington School is \\"one of the best, most complete and thoroughly equipped (schools)\\" and \\"means not only a great deal from an educational standpoint bur also from the standpoint looking to the material advancement of the City\\". Washington School stands not only as a reminder of Prescott's history, but as a bridge between the time-honored traditions of the educational past and the promises of the future. Washington School is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. --  Wilson Block and Wilson Apartments   104 North Montezuma Street   --  Pauline Weaver   321 W Gurley Street  Pauline Weaver 1800 - 1867 Known as Prescott's first citizen, Weaver was a trapper, miner, Army Scout and friend of the Indians.

In February 1311, Malik Kafur besieged the Hoysala capital Dwarasamudra, and the defending ruler Veera Ballala III surrendered without much resistance. Ballala agreed to pay the Delhi Sultanate an annual tribute, and surrendered a great amount of wealth, elephants and horses.  Background  By 1310, Alauddin Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate controlled large parts of northern India, and had ended the Mongol threat. The Yadava and Kakatiya rulers of Deccan region in southern India had become his tributaries. During the 1310 Siege of Warangal against the Kakatiyas, his general Malik Kafur had learned that the region to the south of the Yadava and Kakatiya kingdoms was also very wealthy. After returning to Delhi, Kafur told Alauddin about this, and expressed his desire to lead an expedition there. Alauddin readily agreed to the proposal. His motive appears to have been plundering, although his courtier Amir Khusrau claims that the objective of the expedition was to \\"spread the light of shariat\\" in the South.  March to the Hoysala kingdom  On 17 November 1310, the Delhi army led by Malik Kafur marched from Delhi with Alauddin's symbol, the royal canopy. Their first stop was Tankal, a village located on the banks of the Yamuna River; the modern identity of this place is uncertain. Here, the minister of war Khwaja Haji held a review of the army over the next 14 days. The army left Tankal on 2 December 1310, and reached a place called Katihun in 21 stages. The modern identity of this place is also uncertain. After leaving Katihun, the Delhi army crossed hills, valleys and three rivers, the largest of which was Narmada. After 17 days, it reached a place called Ghargaon, which can be identified with modern Khargone. Here, the Delhi generals encamped for 20 days during which they conducted a second review of the army. In addition, the army was reinforced with 23 elephants sent by the Kakatiya king Prataparudra. The Delhi army resumed its march on 29 January 1311, and after crossing the Tapti River, reached the Yadava capital Devagiri on 3 February 1311. The Yadava king Ramachandra had decorated the city to welcome the army, and had made arrangements to facilitate their onward march. He had ensured that all of the army's necessities, including a variety of clothes and fruits, were available at the local bazaars (markets), at a fair price. He had also arranged for a number of money changers (sarrafs) with gold and silver tankas (coins). Khusrau mentions that the Muslim soldiers of the Delhi army and the local Hindus interacted peacefully. After arranging itself in formations and replenishing its stocks at Devagiri, the Delhi army left Devagiri on 7 February 1311. Over the next 5 days, it crossed three rivers: Godavari, Sini (Sina), and Pahnur (or Binhur, identified with Bhima). It halted at Bandri (identified with Pandharpur), the fief of Ramachandra's general Parasuram Deva, who had been instructed by his master to support the Delhi army. With Parasuram's assistance, Malik Kafur learned the following details: Taking advantage of a fight between the Pandya brothers Vira and Sundara, the Hoysala king Veera Ballala III had left his capital to plunder cities in the Pandya territory. However, after learning about the Delhi army's presence in Deccan, he had decided to return to his capital.  Siege and surrender  Ruins of Dwarasamudra, now known as Halebidu The Hoysala ruler Ballala had returned to his capital Dwarasamudra in a hurry, and had little time to make adequate preparations for the impending onslaught from the Delhi army. The Delhi generals wanted to take advantage of this, but it was not possible for the entire Delhi army to reach Dwarasamudra in a short time. So, Maik Kafur selected 10,000 soldiers and marched with them to Dwarasamudra on 14 February 1311. After a 12-day journey, Malik Kafur reached Dwarasamudra on 26 February 1311, and besieged the local fort, which Amir Khusrau describes as a strong fort surrounded by a water body. Ballala's advisors urged him to put up a fight, fearing that negotiating a truce would irreparably damage the kingdom's prestige. However, Ballala did not engage in any conflict other than minor skirmishes. One night, he sent an officer named Gesu Mal (or Gaisu Mal) to collect information about the invading army, and learned that it had subdued other kings like Ramachandra and Prataparudra. He also learned that the invaders intended to attack his fort on the next day. The next morning, Ballala deva sent Balak Deva Nayaka and other envoys out of the fort, and requested a truce. According to Khusrau, Malik Kafur offered the following terms to the Hoysalas: they could accepted Islam, or they could pay a tribute (zimmah). If they accepted neither of these choices, they would be killed. Ballala Deva chose to pay the tribute. Ballala Deva's messengers requested Malik Kafur to send two envoys to their king, so that the terms of the truce could be finalized without any misunderstanding. Malik Kafur obliged, and sent two Hindu messengers inside the fort. Ballala Deva told these messengers that he was ready to surrender all his belongings except his sacred thread, which was an important symbol of his Hindu identity. He also promised to pay an annual tribute in the future. Kafur agreed to these terms, and thus the siege of Dwarasamudra was lifted without much violence. On the same day, Ballala Deva sent his envoys Balak Deva Nayak, Main Deva, Jitmal and others outside the fort. The envoys bowed to Alauddin's royal canopy, and offered 36 elephants. Four days later, Ballala Deva surrendered his horses. A few days later, he himself came out of the fort, bowed before the royal canopy, and surrendered his treasures.  Aftermath  Malik Kafur halted at Dwarasamudra for 12 days, for the rest of his army to catch up. He left Dwarasamudra for the Pandya kingdom on 10 March 1311. The 14th century chronicler Isami states that Ballala Deva guided the Delhi army during the plunder of the Pandya territories, and later, visited Delhi. According to this narrative, Alauddin was very pleased with Ballala's loyalty and assistance in the raid of the Pandya territory. He gave the Hoysala king a robe of honour, a crown, a chhatr, a gift of 1 million tankahs (coins). Historian Banarsi Prasad Saksena doubts this claim, as it does not appear in the writings of the contemporary Delhi courtier Amir Khusrau. However, according to historian Kishori Saran Lal, Ballala Deva's visit to Delhi is corroborated by an inscription which states that the Hoysala king returned from Delhi on 6 May 1313.

Created in 1981 by the Union Miles Community Coalition, it was successful in drawing national attention to discriminatory practices in lending practices and won passage of an Ohio law reforming housing foreclosure procedures. Formation CCCA organizing Cleveland had long suffered from racially discriminatory practices by lending institutions. The Union-Miles Park neighborhood, once a working class, white area, had suffered the loss of most of its employers in the 1959s and 1960s and seen extensive white flight. By the 1970s, the area was overwhelmingly African American, poor, crime-ridden, and decaying. The 1973‚Äì75 recession hit the area especially hard. Many of the most affordable homes were owned or leased by federal, city, or state public housing agencies, yet these homes were some of the most decrepit in the area. The Union-Miles Community Coalition was the culmination of a decade-long process of social justice organizing in Cleveland. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Cleveland formed the Commission on Catholic Community Action (CCCA) in June 1969 to institutionalize its attempts to stem the economic and social losses in the greater Cleveland area. CCCA sought to preserve neighborhoods where the Catholic Church had invested a great deal of financial and human capital in staff, churches, and schools. A major programming area was Union-Miles Park, where there were a large number of Roman Catholic church which were rapidly losing members. CCCA organizers initially used community organizing tactics pioneered by Saul Alinsky. Strongly left-wing groups began to form at the block level. These were too radical for the diocese, which shifted its community organizing efforts to focus on empowerment and asset and wealth preservation. CCCA worked with the Catholic Campaign for Human Development and The George Gund Foundation to organize homeowners and the poor as part of their empowerment initiative. CCCA efforts led directly to the creation of the Union Miles Development Corporation (UMDC). In January 1979, the CCCA helped local neighborhood block groups form a \\"reinvestment committee\\" to agitate around discriminatory practices in home improvement loans. In May 1979, the Union-Miles Community Coalition began picketing area housing lenders, including the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Realizing that a neighborhood-wide effort was needed, CCCA organizers began pushing for the \\"reinvestment committee\\" to build an even larger, more representative coalition which would focus not just on the financial industry but on a range of community issues. During the summer, 185 groups in the Union-Miles Park neighborhood joined the new coalition. The new group, calling itself the Union Miles Community Coalition (UMCC), met for the first time on September 29, 1979. UMCC efforts UMCC initially focused its efforts on the practices of two federal agencies, the FHA and Veterans' Administration (VA). Both were major sources of low-interest home and home improvement loans in the area. In October 1979, UMCC became first community group to win a hearing before the Comptroller of the Currency regarding discriminatory practices in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. By 1980, it had become clear to CCCA organizers that the wider issue of economic development in Union-Miles Park needed to be tackled. But neither Famicos Corp. nor Lutheran Housing Corp. (the two largest nonprofit housing lenders in the city) wanted to become involved in the issue. CCCA staff pushed for the UMCC to establish a nonprofit corporate subsidiary, the Union Miles Development Corporation (UMDC), to take on these issues. Very gradually through 1980 and early 1981, UMCC began adopting procedures and resolutions to establish the new body. Operational history UMDC was formally incorporated as a nonprofit organization on May 1, 1981. It received more than $100,000 ($ in dollars) in start-up financing from a wide range of foundations and religious organizations. UMCC swiftly faded away, however. In 1982, two left-wing groups, the Ohio Action Training Center (OATC) and National People's Action (NAP), decided to target Alton Whitehouse, the president of Standard Oil of Ohio (\\"Sohio\\"), over what they perceived as predatory oil and home heating fuel pricing. Both groups worked with UMCC, among other Cleveland-area community groups, to win support for their activities and to recruit protesters. In April 1982, the OATC and NAP disrupted the Sohio annual shareholder meeting. The weekend of September 10-12, 1982, the groups held another protest at the exclusive Chagrin Valley Hunt Club in Gates Mills, Ohio. More than 300 protesters clamored for Whitehouse to come out of the club and meet with them. (Whitehouse was not present that weekend.) The involvement of UMCC in these activities was not viewed favorably by either Catholic Charities USA or The Gund Foundation, and they both withdrew funding of UMCC. The organization soon withered away. Receivership efforts Initially, UMDC focused on winning grants for small projects that would immediately improve the value of existing, inhabited property. It won a grant to help low-income homeowners weatherize their properties, and another grant to train homeowners in basic home repair and maintenance. It also developed programs to prepare welfare-dependent and homeless families in bill-paying, budgeting, and other consumer skills so they could become reliable rent- or mortgage-paying citizens. The nonprofit declined to get involved in programs with long-term payoffs like Head Start or drug abuse prevention and treatment because of their expense. It also declined to join in a coalition with local businesses. Shortly after UMDC incorporated, businesses in Union-Miles Park formed the Southeast Improvement Association (SIA) to act as a voice for local business. SIA members were concerned that worsening crime in the neighborhood was causing their security costs to rise and made it difficult to attract night-shift workers. Infrastructure and public services in the area were deteriorating, and a lack of contiguous industrial space and extensive cross-streets made it difficult for businesses to expand. Limited funds and the failure of the city to assist in coordinating redevelopment efforts (which could have multiplied the positive impact of UMDC and SIA) discouraged UMDC from working on projects that had spillover potential (such as a land bank that could help businesses expand). Instead, UMDC focused on a more conservative strategy designed to protect the existing assets and wealth of homeowners in the community. It partnered with other nonprofit development corporations in the city in 1981 to create the Cleveland Housing Network, an organization to help train staff in foreclosure and receivership issues and in housing redevelopment. Receivership became a major early tool for UMDC. In 1982 and 1983, the nonprofit pioneered the use of receivership as a means of redeveloping abandoned property. An extensive legal analysis conducted by UMDC revealed that title to many abandoned but inhabitable properties was unclear. A large number of these properties had several owners, who often could not be located. Utilizing a patchwork of state laws, UMDC convinced a local court in March 1984 to place an abandoned home in receivership, with UMDC as trustee. The news media reported that it was believed to be the first time Ohio law had been used in this way. With technical assistance from Cleveland State University Center for Neighborhood Development and a $61,000 ($ in dollars) Ford Foundation grant, UMDC was able to remodel the home and sell it‚Äîhelping to stave off a decline in the value of nearby properties, and remove a potential source of crime and vandalism. The difficulty in using existing law to obtain receivership led UMDC to push for passage of a new state law giving nonprofit community development corporations new powers to act as receivers of abandoned or foreclosed homes in distressed neighborhoods. This legislation, Substitute House Bill 706, became law in 1984. In 1989, UMDC officials testified before Congress regarding fair credit lending practices and FHA's tendency to require larger fees from poorer homeowner loan applicants. This testimony directly influenced successful amendments to the Community Reinvestment Act. New construction efforts As UMDC's technical expertise and finances grew, it began financing new construction. The organization purchased vacant land owned by the city and in 1989 broke ground on an eight-home housing development called Miles Estates. In 1990, UMDC broke ground on the Miles Avenue Shopping Center at E. 131st Street and Miles Avenue. ; This shopping center was the first substantial capital investment in area since the 1950s. In 1993, UMDC won an agreement from the city not to extend Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. Instead, the land which was to be used for the street extension was turned over to UMDC, which in 1993 began construction of the 16-home Harvard Glen housing project.

She was a leader in the social purity movement. She was affiliated with Elizabeth Boynton Harbert. Early years and education Lucinda Banister was born in Potsdam, New York, April 1, 1828. Her parents were Silas Banister and Eliza Smith, both of New England birth and ancestry. Chandler suffered a spinal injury in early infancy from a fall, which caused a life of invalidism and extreme suffering. As a child, she was fond of books and study, and when she entered St. Lawrence Academy (now, State University of New York at Potsdam), at nine years of age, her teacher registered her as two years older, because of her advancement in studies and seeming maturity of years. At the age of 13, her first great disappointment came, when her school course was suspended, never to be resumed, by the severe development of her spinal malady. For several years, even reading was denied to her. Career In the winter of 1870‚Äì71, she wrote \\"Motherhood, Its Power Over Human Destiny,\\" while recuperating from a long illness, and it was so warmly received in Vineland, New Jersey, that it was afterwards published in booklet form. That introduced her to many thinking women of Boston, where in 1871‚Äì72, she held parlor meetings and organized a body of women who were pledged to work for the promotion of enlightened parenthood as well as an equal and high standard of purity for both sexes: the Moral Education Society of Boston. Societies were formed in New York City, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., by the efforts of Chandler and with the cooperation of prominent women. That was the first work in this country in the line of educational standards for the elevation and purity of the relations of men and women, inside as well as outside of marriage. The publication of essays, \\"A Mother's Aid, \\"Children's Rights\\" and the \\"Divineness of Marriage,\\" written by her, followed and furnished a literature for the agitation of questions that later were widely discussed. During one of the long periods of prostration and confinement to her room, to which Chandler was subject, she commenced study on the lines of political economy as a mental tonic and helpful agency to restoration. After her recovery, she wrote extensively for reform publications upon finance reform, the land question and industrial problems. In Chicago, in 1880, the Margaret Fuller Society was founded, especially to interest women in those subjects and the principles of Americanism. A lifelong advocate of the total abstinence principle, Chandler served as vice-president of the Woman's Christian Temperance Alliance of Illinois. She was the first president of the Chicago Moral Educational Society, formed in 1882. She was an advocate of Christian socialism, and a firm believer in the final triumph of the Christian idea of the brotherhood of man as a practical and controlling principle in commercial and industrial systems. Personal life At the age of 20, she married John H. Chandler, who was born and raised in Potsdam. He was a carpenter and joiner by trade. He was also a music teacher and gave musicalconcerts and instruction in music. Their only child was John Nelson who drowned at the age of four years. Chandler's marriage was a happy one. Her husband's care made it possible for her to enjoy a period of usefulness in later life. Chandler died in 1911.

Function This gene encodes a member of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) protein family. Members of the family share several distinct protein modules, including a propeptide region, a metalloproteinase domain, a disintegrin-like domain, and a thrombospondin type 1 (TS) motif.

Soldiers and Sailors Monument (1908-1911) is a Beaux Arts monument in Syracuse, New York, dedicated to the 12,265 men of Onondaga County who served in the Civil War.Soldiers and Sailors Monument, from SIRIS. It was designed by architect Clarence Blackall and includes two bronze sculptures, The Call to Arms and An Incident at Gettysburg by Cyrus Dallin. The Memorial was erected in Clinton Square, alongside the Erie Canal.Hardin, Evamaria, Syracuse Landmarks: An AIA Guide to Downtown and Historic Neighborhoods, photographs by Jon Crispan, Syracuse University Press and Onondaga Historical Society, pp. 34-35. The monument consists of a square granite pylon with attached Roman Ionic columns at its corners, supporting a heavy cornice with a carved frieze, and crowned by a globe guarded by four eagles grasping a thick garland. This is set atop a plinth, and a stepped plaza with corner piers supporting bronze lampposts. The pylon's east and west sides are adorned with bronze high-relief sculpture groups by Dallin. The north and south sides feature granite reliefs of flags and military accoutrements. The plith features dedication plaques, and a quotation from President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. The monument is approximately 75 ft (22.86 m) tall. Dallin won a design competition to produce the two monumental bronze groups, The Call to Arms and An Incident at Gettysburg.The Monumental News, vol. 20, no. 8 (August 1908). The competition's judges included J. Q. A. Ward and Daniel Chester French. Ahrens, Kent, Cyrus E. Dallin: His Small Bronzes and Plasters, Rockwell Museum, Corning, NY, 1995, p. 74. The Incident at Gettysburg group depicts the moment when a Syracuse native, Color Sergeant William C. Lilly of the 149th New York Infantry, paused in the middle of a firefight to repair a broken flagstaff with his belt. Lilly survived Gettysburg but was killed in a later engagement in the War. The monument's cornerstone was laid on Memorial Day, May 31, 1909. It was dedicated on June 21, 1910, although only Dallin‚Äôs The Call to Arms had been installed. Dallin's assistant, Frederick MacMonnies, had been sent to France to attend to the other sculpture group's casting in bronze, but instead got married and went off on his honeymoon. The Incident at Gettysburg was dedicated on June 23, 1911. The Syracuse section of the Erie Canal was filled in and paved over in 1925, to create Erie Boulevard. The monument's original granite plaza measured 50 ft (15.24 m) by 150 ft (45.72 m), but the sections east and west of its central portion were removed in the 1930s, and replaced by landscaping. A reflecting pool that traces the canal's former path was constructed alongside the monument in 2001. It features fountain jets in warm weather and becomes an iceskating rink in winter.

While the collection and storage of infant cord blood has become commonplace since the 1990s, Forever Labs is notable for being the first company to offer collection and storage of adult stem cells.  History  Forever Labs was founded in Ann Arbor, Michigan in 2015 by Dr. Mark Katakowski, Dr. Ben Buller, Dr. Laith Farjo, and Steven Clausnitzer. After initial launch in Michigan, the company now operates in eight states. In the summer of 2017, Forever Labs was invited to participate in the Silicon Valley Incubator Y Combinator.  Procedure  Forever Labs contracts with licensed physicians to perform the collection procedure. The patient lies on his/her side, the area just above the hip is disinfected and locally anesthetized. The physician then uses a special syringe to collect the bone marrow. The cells are spun down with special centrifuge devices, cooled and shipped off to the long term storage facility. The entire process typically takes 15‚Äì20 minutes.  Storage and future use  The patient's stem cells are stored in a clinical-grade cryogenic biorepository for future withdrawal, expansion, and use in disease prevention, longevity treatments, and regenerative medical treatments. Hundreds of clinical trials are currently underway studying the effects of stem cell therapy.

It stars Bhumika Gurung and Abhishek Sharma and premiered on 28 August 2017 on Star Bharat. The show's main theme is about women's empowerment and shows how a girl becomes the Mukhiya (village chief) of her village and then a Vidhayak (MLA) and strives to make a difference in the complicated world of politics. Plot Nimki Mukhiya (Season 1) The story, set in a small village in Bihar, deals with the life of Nimki, a carefree, materialistic girl who accidentally becomes the Mukhiya (chief) of the village. Nimki is mad about cinema, a dreamer and unaware of the darkness of the world. Nimki loves Babbu and she believes that Babbu loves her, too. After becoming chief of the village, Nimki is married to Babbu Singh, son of Tetar Singh, former chief of the village. Tetar's intention to make Nimki his daughter-in-law is to fulfill his political ambitions but no one in Babbu's family accepts Nimki. They housed her in a maid's room and treated her like one. But Nimki believed that Tetar's family will love her one day. After many incidents Sweety, Babbu's sister befriends her. Meanwhile, Sweety falls in love with BDO Abhimanyu Rai. But Abhimanyu loved Nimki secretly and he could not express his love and agrees to marry Sweety, who has just divorced her cheating husband, Rituraj. Tetar did not favour this and planned against Nimki. Babbu shoots Sweety to stop her marriage with Abhimanyu. Sweety realises Abhimanyu's feelings for Nimki and hence decides to leave him and remarries Rituraj, when Rituraj learns why Sweety marries him, he blackmails and rapes Sweety. Tunney is aware that Rituraj rapes Sweety daily, but keeps mum to reunite Ahimanyu and Nimki. Nimki realises that she never loves Babbu, it was just attraction rather she started loving Abhimanyu. She organises a fashion show in the village to raise funds for development, but Tetar and Babbu are opposed. Before the beginning of the fashion show Tetar Singh tries to stop it and the villagers insult him. To avenge his father's insult, during the fashion show Babbu rapes Nimki. Unlike other victims of rape, Nimki overcomes her sorrow and again lives her normal life. She doesn't change her attitude or her swag. Nimki takes Babbu to court on rape charges, but Babbu kidnaps Elina to blackmail Tunney into giving fake proof against Nimki in court. She still tries to get him punished, but he is declared innocent. She then learns of her pregnancy. Babbu saves his sister Sweety from being raped by Rituraj, then realises his mistake and asks Nimki's forgiveness. He reforms and pleads with her to give their marriage a second chance. Seeing his changed behaviour, she forgives him and moves back into the mansion with him upsetting her family members. Nimki decides to support Babbu to teach him lesson for his wrongdoing but she doesn't want to involve her family members in this fight therefore she maintains a distance from them, further disappointing them. Mahua is angry on her and doesn't allow her to meet sick Monu. She asks Nimki to choose between her and Babbu and Nimki chooses Babbu as he is the father of her unborn child. To harm Babbu, Mahua throws a brick at Babbu but Nimki comes in between and the brick hits her abdomen. After realising Nimki's support for him, Babbu decides to support her and chooses her over his family as she, too, chose him over her own family. To free Sweety from Rituraaj, Nimki suggests to Babbu to contest the election. Tetar Singh becomes angry that his own son challenges him in the election. Both parties gain the voters' trust. One such day, Monu comes to Haveli to meet Nimki after learning that Nimki visits Ghattola. Nimki slaps Anaro when she insults Monu. Nimki tries every way to break every pillar of Haveli. Nimki Babbu shares some lovey-dovey moments while talking to their unborn. Tunney has little understanding towards Nimki's plan and he along with Abhimanyu secretly support Nimki. Tater Singh holds a rally in the village, where he bridges himself with praise. He tells Nimki's sister Mahuaa to speak out against Nimki and Babbu. Rituraj rebuked Sweety for her condition after Tetar Singh wins the election. Just then, Sweety tells the crowd of villagers not to vote for Tater Singh and that he is not fit to be called a human and beats Rituraaj in front of everyone. Tater Singh's rally is spoiled. After some time Babbu goes to Nimki's house and she tells us how much Nimki loves her sister Mahuaa and all the family members. Mahuaa and everyone else agree that Babbu has improved and all are happy as before. Babbu arrives at the mansion to take Nimki to reunite him with his family. In Babbu's absence, Tetar and Rituraj tangle with Sweety and Nimki and knock Nimki down on the stomach. Annaro Devi is also there, severely deteriorating Nimki's condition. Tetar Singh realises that Nimki's condition is critical. To eliminate Babbu from MLA position, Tetar makes his wife Annaro Devi a pawn and knocks her down the stairs while Rekha (Dabloo's wife) is watching. Now Diamond is also with Nimki. When the police arrive, Anaro Devi gives testimony against Babbu. She holds Babbu responsible for her and Nimki's accident. Nimki loses her child, enraging Babbu. Nimki and Babbu decide to punish everyone who is responsible for death of his unborn child. A fight ensures between Babu and Tetar Singh. Anaro and Diamond also arrive. Nimki goes missing, Tunney, Abhimanyu and Sweety search for her. Meanwhile, Anaro tries to stop Babbu and Tetar Singh's fight. On the way, Abhimanyu and Sweety's car collides with a tree. Abhimanyu is hit on the head, seeing Sweety's care and love for him, Abhimanyu chooses Sweety over Nimki. Nimki arrives there and reveals to Tetar Singh and others that it was on Rituraaj's suggestion, not hers, that Babbu decided to contest the election, therefore he begs Nimki. She then shows a recorded video in which Rituraaj suggested to Babbu to accept Nimki as it was the only way to win the MLA seat and go against his own family. The more he defied his family, the more voters trusted him and his chances of him winning the MLA election would increase. Tetar knocks down Babbu, Anaro doesn't believe this and after giving her testimony against Tetar Singh she goes insane. Nimki approaches Babbu and says that she knew he has not changed Babbu Singh and that he resembles his father and that even were Babbu to change, she would not forgive him, and that she is an example for those who are unable to act for fear of being raped. She labelled him a rapist and said that she would never forgive him. The police then arrest Tetar Singh. While leaving, Tetar Singh kills Rituraj with a stone. Anaro Devi cannot believe that her son has died. Nimki remembers all the previous things but she wears her glasses to hide her pain and walks away. Two years later Nimki Vidhayak (Season 2) Nimki becomes Vidhayak and she lives with Bimla Chachi and Monu. Nimki holds Tunney and Mahua responsible for her unborn's death. Mahua and Tunney don't believe that for once Nimki ever asked them why they did so. Mahua is pursuing her education while Tunney does small jobs, both live in Patna. Anaro Devi can't handle the death of Babbu and goes insane which led her to stay in a mental asylum. Nimki never forgets her unborn child and hence helps Anaro Devi in her treatment. Sweety and Abhimanyu are now happily married, Sweety is pregnant and they live in Patna with their daughter Alina. Nimki becomes Vidhayak and comes to Patna, regains her rights on her bungalow by dramatically fighting with ex-MLA. The hero of the show, Mintoo Singh, now appears. Mintoo Singh (played by Abhishek Sharma) is a look-alike of Babbu Singh but has a completely different personality. He lives with his dadi (Dadi is the older version of Nimki) and has two friends Pichku and Tillu. Mintoo, unlike Babbu Singh, is a happy-go-lucky boy. Nimki meets the powerful and good-hearted Ganga Devi. While protesting outside Vidhan Bhawan, Ganga Devi is shot by a goon and she is hospitalised. It is later revealed that she is the one who hired the gunman to shoot her security personnel so that she can gain some sympathy and votes. Nimki, unaware of the true face of Gangadevi, idolises her. Ganga Devi has a spoiled son, Parag. While driving rashly, he hits Anaro Devi who runs behind Mintoo Singh, thinking he is her Babbu. Nimki and Mintoo face some hit-and-miss moments. While helping Mishra's sister in marriage, Nimki and Mintoo have to don an avatar of bride and groom, that's where Nimki first saw Mintoo and is completely traumatised. Nimki and Mintoo meet again in hospital where she realises that he is not Babbu, but his look alike. Since Nimki helps in the marriage of Mishra (another MLA)'s sister against his will, he wants to kill her. Mintoo saves her in time. He brings her home where Dadi calls the bride's family to fix Mintoo's marriage. They misunderstand Nimki and Mintoo's relationship and the alliance breaks. Mintoo cares for Nimki. Dadi doesn't like Nimki because she is MLA. Mintoo's mother (Ganga Devi) leaves Mintoo for politics hence Dadi hates politics and politicians. Mintoo Singh receives news of his Dadi having a brain tumor and is saddened. Accidentally Mintoo completes process of jitiya fast, Anaro Devi demands to eat food only if Babbu feeds her. Food intake is much needed for Anaro Devi, hence Nimki decides to change the avatar of Mintoo Singh to Babbu Singh. Mintoo Singh agrees for the same and Nimki gives him training to become Babbu Singh. Mintu and his friends hold a protest in front of Ganga Devi's house chanting slogans, Mintu does the protest only for the treatment of his dadi. Nimki tries to hide Mintu from her family, she knows this will badly impact everyone, especially Sweety (Shriya Jha). Ganga Devi traps Shukla, therefore Shukla has to call police and arrest his own men. Ganga Devi calls Nimki and asks her to stop Mintu otherwise he may land in trouble. To impress Ganga Devi, Nimki with the help of Dadi, makes a drama of Dadi's death. Upon learning about Dadi's death Mintu runs towards home. After recognizing the foul play, Mintu strangles Nimki and is angry at Nimki (since Mintu knows that Dadi is actually suffering and can die anytime if not treated), after realising his mistake he apologises to Nimki and they resume their plan of Babbu Simgh to treat Anaro Devi. Mintu and Nimki's family attends Navratri function that was held by Ganga Devi. Ganga Devi arranges this function to divert peoples mind from Parag's gambling. Mintu and Nimki share some moments and dance together. On Dadi's insistence, Tillu, Pichku and Mintu return home halfway through the function. Nimki dances with Ganga Devi. At function Nimki meets with Tunney and Mahua and the sisters quarrel. Mahua leaves the function in anger but in meanwhile Parag (Sagar Wahi) misbehaves with her. Nimki slaps Parag for his action. Mahua gives statement against Nimki to the media. At night Ganga Devi's goons throw Tunney and Mahua out of the house along with their baggage. After a long drama, Mahua and Tunney settle in Nimki's bungalow. Ganga Devi attempts to topple the current government by using a \\"No Confidence Motion\\" and she is confident that the government will fall. But the government survives by a two-vote margin, since Nimki and Ganga Devi vote to sustain, to save Dadi because Dadi was kidnapped by Shukla and to hide the past.

Sources differ on his precise birth year with at least three dates given‚Äî1825, 1831, and 1843. Heppner's headstone in the Beth Israel Cemetery in Portland, Oregon lists his birth year as 1831.

(Heppner, Morrow County, Or.) 1892-1912, April 19, 1900, Image 3; Image provided by Morrow County Museum; Heppner, OR; University of Oregon Libraries. Heppner and other family members first settled in New York and later in California. In California, Heppner clerked a store and eventually began his own mercantile business. Heppner eventually relocated from California to Oregon where he spent time in Corvallis and The Dalles. The 1860 U.S. Census listed his occupation as a pack train operator in Wasco County. Circa 1862, Heppner joined hundreds seeking profits from recent gold discoveries in eastern Oregon and western Idaho. Heppner found opportunity and success in freighting supplies to the mining districts for over ten years. Heppner settled in eastern Oregon where he was involved in early merchant work in parts of the present-day towns of Arlington, Heppner, La Grande, and Umatilla. Heppner found success in a variety of business ventures in eastern Oregon. One of his most prominent was establishing a store with Colonel Jackson Lee Morrow in 1873 in Stansbury Flats, a small settlement in north- central Oregon. The settlement would later rename itself Heppner in Heppner's honor despite his objections. Heppner and his brother-in-law, Henry Blackman, were successful business partners in several early enterprises in and around Heppner. Among their pursuits were building and managing a warehouse and a general trading store. These businesses were so successful in the early 1880s that they reportedly influenced the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company to bring rail transportation to Heppner as early as December 7, 1889.  Final years  Heppner would go on to support several efforts to build the nascent town named after him. He co-founded the Heppner Gazette newspaper with Henry Blackman and contributed relief and recovery funds to the town following the Flood of 1903. He was a member of Heppner Masonic Order and at one point affectionately called \\"Uncle Henry\\" in local press. He and his nephew, Phill Cohn, provided substantial contributions to the construction of the first Catholic church in Heppner. Heppner did not wed or have children. He was characterized as \\"an unpretentious man, [who] dressed simply, and lived simply.\\" Additional sources described him as \\"a little eccentric, [but also] a big-hearted man.\\" In a 1971 history of the County of Morrow, Heppner was described as a \\"5' 6\\", 150-pound bundle of mental energy, always planning the next move. More than anyone else, he shaped the destin[y] of Heppner.\\" Heppner died on February 16, 1905 in Heppner following at least two years of complications from several illnesses.Oregon Historical Society; Portland, OR; Index Collection: Pioneer Index. Sources again conflict on the date, though one newspaper assures readers that Heppner passed on the same day that the County of Morrow was founded. A few days after his death, a Portland-based newspaper stated that with Heppner's passing \\"goes...a prominent landmark in the history of Heppner and Morrow County. In times of need he has helped many.\\" Heppner's last will and testament divided the profits from his estate among his surviving siblings and relatives, including Dora, Elias, Elizabeth, Fanny, Flora, Kaskel, and Jenny.Record of Wills, 1886-1941; Author: Morrow County (Oregon). County Clerk; Probate Place: Morrow, Oregon. He was buried in the Beth Israel Cemetery in Portland, Oregon. The value of Heppner's estate in 1905 was valued at $150,000, roughly equivalent to $3.5 million in 2017. In a 1916 edition of the Heppner Gazette-Times, the newspaper re-published an article from May 7, 1891 in which the paper states that \\"Heppner Ought To Have More Heppners,\\" a nod to Heppner‚Äôs business savvy and investment in the burgeoning town.

The station is run as a club within the University of Sydney Union, and broadcasts online through the iHeartRadio platform. SURG stands for the 'Sydney University Radio Group'. History Student radio groups have existed on the University of Sydney campus since the 1920s. In 1924 Major E. H. Booth, then President of the Sydney University Union, founded the Radio Club, with Professor J. P. V. Madsen as President. Holding lectures on subjects such as ‚ÄòThe Fundamentals of Broadcasting‚Äô, ‚ÄòThe Nature of Wireless Waves & Methods of Broadcasting‚Äô, ‚ÄòBroadcasting & Reception‚Äô, and ‚ÄòCommercial Wireless‚Äô, the club had 30 members and averaged 4 members at their weekly events. Madsen proposed in 1926 that their studies should continue under a ‚ÄòRadio Research Board‚Äô within the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR ‚Äì now the CSIRO), which was founded the same year. The CSIR would build the first National Standards Laboratory in Australia ‚Äì what is now the Madsen Building. In the late 1970s, University Broadcasting Services, running from the Wentworth building, created content and recorded lectures for 2SER. When further community radio licenses were made available to Sydney stations, the USU Society, ‚ÄòSydney University Friends of the Radio Station‚Äô, was formed to conduct test broadcasts and lobby for a campus station, under the name 2SUX. After a General Meeting of the USU attracted 30 people ‚Äì 21 voting for and 9 against the bid, the USU withdraw its support of the society‚Äôs bid as it was believed not an economically feasible investment at the time. Radio Skid Row-Radio Redfern took over the Wentworth studio until being kicked out in June 1984. University Broadcasting Services, now FBi Radio, was granted a lease to use the space under the Footbridge Theatre in the mid-90s, and moved briefly to the Wentworth studio before leaving for a Pitt St Mall shopfront, and then finally moving to their current home in Waterloo in the early 2000s. At the same time, William Balfour created the Sydney University Radio Group. When FBi left campus, SURG applied for a Temporary Community Broadcast License, broadcasting twice a year from Manning House or a caravan in front of the Quadrangle: for a week during O-Week, and for two weeks during Verge Festival in October. The license was owned by the USU and thus the station was formally ‚ÄòUSUFM‚Äô, used interchangeably with ‚ÄòSURG FM‚Äô. In late 2010, after renovations to the Holme Building radio studio, SURG began to use that space for its broadcast periods, broadcasting from the University‚Äôs own FM transmitter on top of Fisher Library. In Semester 2 2012, SURG launched its online broadcast, broadcasting on weekdays for 10 weeks of each semester. This coincided with a Memorandum of Understanding with the USU, noting that SURG provides a service outside the scope of most clubs and societies, and thus receives special funding. This was resigned in following years, culminating in the current 2015 MOU which terminates December 31, 2017. In Semester 1 2017, SURG launched in iHeartRadio, ‚ÄòAustralia‚Äôs leading online entertainment platform‚Äô, appearing next to radio stations from Australian Radio Network (ARN) and national broadcasters.  Current structure  SURG is run as a club within the University of Sydney Union. This means it is independent but relies on funding from the Union's Clubs & Societies Program, of up to $6000 per annum. SURG is run by a student executive, elected in October of each year. The current executive consists of Andrew Rickert (President), Jake Landa (Vice President), Haydn Hickson (Secretary), Jack Foster (Treasurer), Abbey Lenton (Publicity Officer), Beckett McNeil (Technical Officer), Deepa Alam (Music Director), Jasper Bruce (General Executive) and Bronte Coles (General Executive).

Macrinus, a native of Mytilene, was a descendant of one of the more famous inhabitants of the island of Lesbos, Theophanes of Mytilene; this was the origin of his cognomen Neos Theophanes, or \\"The New Theophanes\\". The descendants of the original Theophanes had fallen into the disfavor of the emperor Tiberius, and in the year 33 AD many were forced to commit suicide or driven into exile.Tacitus, Annales, VI.18  Career  An inscription, now preserved in the Museum of Mytilene, provides details of Macrinus' cursus honorum.Greek text published with a French translation in Ren√© Hodot, \\"La grande inscription de M.

After stepping down from the office of praetor, Macrinus received a series of imperial appointments. First was procurator of the Via Latina for a period of about two years. This was followed with a commission as legatus or commander of Legio VI Victrix, which was stationed at Novaesium (modern Neuss) on the Rhine frontier, which he held for about three years.

It neighbors Belarus and is an enemy of the Union State. Veyshnoria occupies most of the Grodno Region and the northwestern parts of the Minsk and Vitebsk regions. There are two other fictional enemies of the Zapad 2017 participants: Vesbaria and Lubenia. Lubenia straddles the Suwalki gap and covers parts of northeastern Poland and southwestern Lithuania, while Vesbaria covers the rest of Lithuania and central Latvia. The \\"proclamation\\" of the state caused a response on the Internet, often humorous.Republic of Veishnoria: Official page and social network Since September 2017, a web-based Veyshnoria have been proclaimed, which started acquiring the signs of an internet-based micronation with more than 10 thousand people signing for \\"citizenship\\". Toponomy The name \\"Veyshnoria\\" comes from the Baltic name of Veisnor (Lithuanian \\"Vai≈°noras\\", Old Prussian \\"Waisnor\\") ‚Äì \\"one who willingly treats\\" (hospitable). There are several places in Lithuania called Vai≈°noriai (plural for \\"Vai≈°noras\\").Vai≈°noriai (≈†iauliai), Vai≈°noriai (Joni≈°kis) Zapad 2017 scenario Zapad 2017 was a joint strategic military exercise of the armed forces of the Russian Federation and Belarus (the Union State of Russia and Belarus) held 14‚Äì20 September 2017, in Belarus as well as in Russia‚Ä≤s Kaliningrad Oblast and other north-western areas. According to the scenario a conflict between \\"The North\\" (the Union State) and \\"The West\\" (a coalition of three aggressor states: Veyshnoria, Vesbaria and Lubenia) developed. \\"The West\\" tries to split the union of Belarus and Russia, worsen the socio- economic situation in the Union State, and force a change of leadership, and Veyshnoria is trying to annex parts of Belarus. After that, \\"the West\\" sends its troops enter the rest of the territory of Belarus. The Union State resists these actions. Paznyak's electoral map In a post on Facebook, Sergey Chaly noticed a similarity between Veyshnoria and the region of Belarus where a large percentage of voters supported Zianon Pazniak in the first round of the 1994 presidential election. Journalist Leonid Bershidsky further pointed out that this territory has a high proportion of Catholic population and a high share of Belarusian-language speakers in the bilingual Russian-Belarusian state with dominant Russian Orthodox church. In Bershidsky's view these observations may be how the Zapad 2017 scenario was intended to be seen: Veyshnoria seeks destabilization of Belarus the same way, in the eyes of the Russian establishment, it happened in Ukraine (by pro-Western national forces, allegedly fomented by \\"the West\\"). Internet reaction The creation quickly found a humorous response in social media. On 30 August 2017, a satirical Twitter account of the Foreign Ministry of Veyshnoria appeared, which published political statements on behalf of the state. According to the account, the anthem of the state is the song \\"Niamon\\" (meaning \\"Neman\\") by the Belarusian band Stary Olsa. The same account says that the official residences of the state are in Grodno, the parliament and the government (in addition to the Ministry of Culture) in Lida, and the cultural capital of Veyshnoria is Smarhon. Veyshnoria is also present on Facebook, and its Russian Wikipedia article had been noted as \\"a dry rundown of how Veyshnoria emerged\\" before the article was deleted and redirected to the article on Zapad 2017.  Monetization  Some Belarusian businessmen were quick to monetize Veyshnoria by launching a Veyshnoria website and legally registering it as a gaming service. After Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko issued the decree which made cryptocurrencies a legal method of payment and the Taler (TLR) cryptocurrency was launched in Belarus, Taler was made the official currency of Veyshnoria. Notable Veyshnorians Online \\"Veyshnorians\\" were quick to notice that the following famous persons have Veyshnorian descent:\\"–ú–ò, –ù–ï–ó–ê–õ–ï–ñ–ù–Ü –í–ï–ô–®–ù–û–†–¶–´‚Ä¶\\" (\\"We, Independent Veyshnorians...\\") September 9, 2017 (retrieved November 28, 2017) *Olga Korbut, Olympic gymnast, was born in Grodno *Shimon Peres, the 9th President of Israel, was born in Vishnyeva, Valozhyn Raion, Minsk Region, near the border with Lithuania *Parents of Charles Kushner, a relative-in-law to Donald Trump, were Holocaust survivors from Navahrudak area (see Joseph Kushner).

The cave is located NE of Doberdob Lake, near the top of a small hill, in the small village of Jamiano. The name is referred to the artillery battery set in the cave during World War I. Morphology Grotta dell'Artiglieria opens above sea level. Overall, it is long and deep. The cave is made up of three main rooms, connected by small pits. The entrance is vertical and leads to the first room. On the left side of this cavern, a pit leads to the second room. Another small pit, made up of collapsed bedrocks, leads to the last room, which is the biggest one. This room is full of cave formations and declines subhorizontally until reaching the deepest part of the cave. History The cave entrance is located in the vicinity of a panoramic viewpoint, whence it is possible to observe most of the Gorizia Karst, including Doberdob Lake. Because of its location, during World War I, the Austro-Hungarian Army used the first part of the cave as an observation post and placed an artillery battery in it. The Italian Army also used the cavity when occupying the area. Still now, the remains of a small plaque dedicated to an Italian Artillery Regiment can be seen next to the entrance. Fauna In the last decades, the cave was known to be the refuge of an important bat colony, including some hundred specimens. Bat species are the common bent-wing bat Miniopterus schreibersiii and the Mediterranean horseshoe bat Rhinolophus euryale. Recently, the colony has strongly decreased and, at certain periods of the year, is completely absent. A fair number of individuals (about 30) has recently been observed between September and October, the breeding season, immediately prior to hibernation. Why the colony has decreased and where individuals move throughout the year are still unknown. The Bat colony causes a huge amount of bat guano to accumulate in the innermost part of the cave. A large invertebrate community developed using guano as primary food source. Invertebrates are cave dwelling species typical of the Karst area. Troglobites include woodlouses Alpioniscus strasseri and Androniscus stygius, and the round fungus beetle Bathysciotes khevenhulleri tergestinus. Troglophiles include the spiders Nesticus eremita and Troglohyphantes excavatus, the cave cricket Troglophilus neglectus, the cricket Gryllomorpha dalmatina, the moth Scoliopteryx libatrix, the fly Limonia nubeculosa and a unidentified phorid fly species, the ground beetles Laemostenus cavicola and Laemostenus elongatus, and the rove beetle Atheta spelaea.

The film stars Pranav Mohanlal in the title role (in his debut adult role) and features Jagapati Babu, Aditi Ravi, Anusree, Siddique, Lena, Sharaf U Dheen, Siju Wilson, Meghanathan, Sijoy Varghese, Tony Luke, and Krishna Shankar in supporting roles. It was produced by Antony Perumbavoor through Aashirvad Cinemas. The original soundtrack for the film was composed by Anil Johnson. Aadhi also mark Pranav's debut as a singer- songwriter with the song \\"Gypsy Women\\" he wrote, sung, and performed. The principal photography took place between August and November 2017 in Kochi, Bangalore, and Hyderabad. Aadhi was released in India on 26 January 2018 and met with positive critical response. The film was a major commercial success, becoming one of the highest-grossing Malayalam films of the year and ran over 100 days in theatres. Plot Aadhi aspires to become a music director in cinema who is doing local singing gigs. His other passion is parkour which he practices regularly. He receives some support from his father, Mohan Varma, a successful businessman, he is not so optimistic about Aadhi's musical career and wants him to earn a livelihood from business. His mother, Rosy, however, supports his wishes except the parkour. Aadhi is trying hard to get a breakthrough. Mohan sends Aadhi to take his friend Roy's car to Bangalore to receive Roy after his foreign trip. In Bangalore, Aadhi goes to a nightclub where eminent personalities from music industry gathers and seeks an opportunity to perform a musical so as to catch their attention. He gets a shot at performing and happens to meet a friend, Anjana, who is accompanied by her boss' son and nephew (Jayakrishnan), both of whom gets over-jealous on seeing Anjana dancing to Aadhi's performance. They make a fuss and Aadhi leaves the podium. He goes to the rooftop. Anjana on the behest of apology, goes to him, only for the other two to intervene and create a commotion, in which her Jayakrishnan accidentally kicks the boss' son of the roof to his death. The deceased was the son of Narayana Reddy, the owner of Pinnacle Group and a greatly influential person in the whole of Bangalore city. Jayakrishnan intimidates Anjana and frames Aadhi for the death and informs it to Reddy, who seeks to take revenge on Aadhi. He uses his influence to make it an accidental death to avoid police intervention and starts an underground manhunt for Aadhi, using a picture of him captured by the security camera in the club. Reddy gets hold of the car that Aadhi brought to the pub, his dad's boss's one, and through the security cam footage that he stays somewhere in the Bangalore-Mysore road. He sends his goons to catch Aadhi, while unbeknownst to all of it, is in the streets. But using his free running skills, he evades the goons only to end up with Sharath. Sharath takes him home and tells him about the bounty Reddy has placed on him. Sharath also tells him that he will help him as Reddy has caused ill fates to his family, and is the sole reason why his family is this way. Sharath agrees to help him and his sister Jaya to approves of that. Sharath takes help from his friend Mani Annan and decides to plot an escape plan, all to go waste. Aadhi meets up with his dad at Sharath's home and decides to go abroad. He takes refuge in an abandoned factory until his escape plan is done. In the meantime, Reddy urges the cops to have a lookout for Aadhi and all the transport routes are inspected for Aadhi's suspected departure. Aadhi having lost his phone, keeps on his communication with his parents through Sharath and this intrigues Reddy, who decides to go for call tracing on that. Suspecting of his activities being disclosed, Jayakrishnan readily takes over the responsibility of monitoring the calls. He overhears the call and confirms Aadhi's location and goes with some goons to get done with Aadhi. Aadhi somehow escapes from them and interprets that Jayakrishnan has been tapping his phone calls. Jayakrishnan, having learned of Sharath's role in Aadhi's hideout, captures him and murders him before Sharath discloses Jayakrishnan's role in the death of Reddy's son. This creates a stir and Aadhi is forced to leave the hideout. Aadhi plots a new plan to disclose things to Reddy, as the situation brings him to the conclusion that Jayakrishnan devised the whole plan to save face, owing to the fact that Reddy might kill him if he is found guilty. Aadhi takes help from Mani Annan and a former employee of the Pinnacle Group, Ebin to disclose Reddy on all the happenings at his office in Bangalore. As per Ebin's request, he gets hold of gadgets to gain access to the security cam footage of the building and thereby get to Reddy's office. He also uses Anjana to device a plan so that Jayakrishnan stays out of the office and passes information that he is going to meet Reddy at an event outside his office late one day. Jayakrishnan leaves the office soon. Aadhi gets inside the office through the service exit, and Anjana through the front door, which alerts Jayakrishnan who returns soon after. Meanwhile, both reach Reddy's office, only for Reddy to attack Aadhi, who later convinces Reddy of Jayakrishnan's part in the ploy. Jayakrishnan soon comes and shoots Reddy, and leaves him for dead, and along with Siddharth aka Siddhu discloses them as partners intending on killing Reddy and take his wealth. Siddhu never intended on sharing and turns on Jayakrishnan and kills him and moves to kill Aadhi and Anjana as well. Aadhi makes a quick run for it and reaches the 10th floor of the building. He is taken out by the guards before he could rappel out. He is taken down by the guards and Siddhu gets down to kill him. Before Siddhu could shoot him, it is revealed that the 10th- floor exit was an escape plan and Aadhi performs a D√ºlfersitz just before Ebin turns the fire alarm on, to shower gasoline on them. Aadhi throws a lighter and escapes out in the ensuing explosion. Reddy recovers and it is revealed that Aadhi is set free and Jayakrishnan and Siddhu was killed because of the explosion on the 10th floor.

The film marks the return of Pranav as an actor, who had earlier appeared as child actor. He had worked with Jeethu as an assistant director in two filmsPapanasam and Life of Josutty. The project was green-lit a few days before the announcement when Jeethu had a discussion with Pranav. After learning Pranav wanted to return to acting, Jeethu approached him with an abstract idea of a film and received positive feedback. Jeethu was in charge of writing; he had completed the story by the time of the announcement and had begun writing the screenplay, intending it to be his next directorial. He described the film as an action movie and a thriller, but it will not resemble a thriller like his 2013 film Memories. Jeethu had developed the story idea during his college education. His protagonist was a marathon or cross country runner, whose athletic skills aid him in the story. For the film, it was changed to parkour since Pranav had learned it during his academic life. The entire plot takes place within one week or 10 days. By the end of March 2017, Jeethu said he was working on the script and hoped to start filming by June, with the rest of the cast finalizing after the first draft is prepared. In early May, Jeethu confirmed that the first draft was complete and they were about to enter pre-production, with the filming planned to begin in the second half of 2017. In mid-May he stated that he is still working on the screenplay. In early July 2017, Jeethu said he intended to start filming by the end of that month. For the film, Pranav trained in parkour. The title Aadhi along with an animated digital poster were revealed on 5 July at the puja function of the film held at hotel Vivanta by Taj in Thycaud, Thiruvananthapuram. The venue was shared with the puja of Aashirvad Cinemas's Odiyan. Aadhi is billed with the tagline, \\"some lies can be deadly\\". Satheesh Kurup was signed as the cinematographer, while Anil Johnson as music composer.  Casting  Pranav plays Aadhi, an urban youth who loves music and aspires to become a music director. Although Pranav was described about his character, Jeethu gave him freedom to mould the character accordingly. In August 2017, Siddique, Sharaf U Dheen, and Siju Wilson were confirmed in prominent roles. Initially Sunny Wayne was signed for a role but had to cancel because of scheduling conflicts. The film has no romantic track. The leading female roles were played by Anusree, Aditi Ravi, and Lena. Aditi plays Anjana, a Bangalore-based Malayali banking professional. She was suggested to Jeethu by cinematographer Satheesh Kurup, who worked in her debut film Alamara; Aditi was cast after a screen test. Siddique and Lena play Aadhi's father and mother. Also in August 2017, confirming his presence, Tony Luke shared his character look on a social networking site, sporting a thick beard.

Preliminary principal photography commenced on 5 July 2017 at hotel Vivanta by Taj in Thycaud, Thiruvananthapuram after a puja function held at the same venueit was a single brief shot featuring Pranav. The regular filming began on 1 August 2017 in Nedumbassery, Kochi. Pranav was seen playing a guitar in the scene stills taken on the day. Early in this schedule, some scenes were filmed inside a studio near Pathadipalam in Kochi, inside which a house was created in set. Pranav and Anusree were present in that segment. The first schedule in Kochi continued until 10 August and the second schedule began in Bangalore the following week. The schedule was expected to continue until mid-September and then shift to Hyderabad by the end of the month. In early September, Jeethu said the crew had already filmed two songs of the three songs. The unit finished filming in Bangalore and shifted to Hyderabad earlier than scheduled due to rain. Filming began at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad from 3 September; the scenes including an office, a building, a club, and a dance bar had originally been planned for Bangalore but were shot in Ramoji Film City instead. The schedule in Ramoji Film City was planned for 20 days. The film also had location shooting in a few streets in Hyderabad. Pranav, Aditi, and Anusree took part in this schedule. Jeethu's spouse Linta Jeethu was the film's costume designer. Pranav received the screenplay early and had several discussions with Jeethu, who said, \\"because he has been through the script so many times, he is able to add his improvisations\\" and \\"directing him has been a seamless experience\\". By the end of September 2017, Jeethu said they had one month of shoot left in Hyderabad and would soon film the action scenes, for which a foreign stunt director would join the unit. After completing the action scenes, the crew would shift again between Kochi and Bangalore. On 23 October, the unit returned to Kochi to begin the final phase of filming; the climax scenes were shot in the next two days. Pranav was injured while breaking glass for a scene. While performing an action scene in Kochi, Pranav's finger bruised and bled; he was taken to a hospital and was prescribed two days' rest. The crew had only three days of filming left and were about to return to Hyderabad for the weekend. Since the upcoming action scenes require many hand movements, filming was postponed to the next week. They were permitted to shoot only at weekends. When the first poster of the film was released on 4 November, Jeethu wrote on his social networking page that the final phase of filming was progressing in Hyderabad. Filming was wrapped on 8 November 2017.  Music  Anil Johnson composed the music for the film, it features three songs. Besides acting, Pranav made his debut as a playback singer and songwriter with a retro English track in the film. When Jeethu asked, Pranav expressed interest in writing and singing the track that appears in a live performance scene in the film. He also played the guitar. Johnson was confident of Pranav's singing and guitar skills. Titling the song, finalizing the tune, and recording, was done in Kochi after Pranav returned from the final filming schedule in Hyderabad. \\"Sooryane\\", a single from the film was released by Goodwill Entertainments label on 5 January 2018 for digital download and as music video on YouTube. It was sung by Najim Arshad and written by Santhosh Varma. The music work was done at Blacknoise studio in Kochi and 20 dB Studios in Chennai.  Release The makers initially targeted a release by Christmas 2017, but in August that year, Jeethu confirmed the film would not be released at Christmas because filming was expected to finish by October and the film would have an extensive post-production. In early November 2017, Jeethu stated they had a few more days of filming left but had already begun the post-production work to ensure a release by the end of January 2018. Release date was confirmed in December 2017. Aadhi released in India on 26 January 2018. Critical reception Aadhi opened to positive response from critics. Anna M. M. Vetticad from Firstpost rated 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote that \\"Pranav Mohanlal is a perfect fit for a smashing action flick\\" and called it \\"one of the most exciting rollercoaster rides ever to emerge from Malayalam cinema ... Aadhi is marked by some clever writing, slick execution, top-notch production values and chases that are so frickin' awesome, they rival the Bourne films although Mollywood works on a fraction of the budget of an average Hollywood venture\\" and \\"Parkour is not Pranav's only strength. He is sweet-looking and a natural before the camera\\". Meera Suresh of The New Indian Express also gave 3.5 out of 5 and called it \\"an impressive debut from Pranav\\", stating that \\"it is a film made just for Pranav, to announce his arrival, and it is nothing less than grand ... Pranav makes it all worthwhile. With mind-boggling action sequences and enough screen presence, Mohanlal's son makes a comfortable debut, winning us with his charisma ... Full marks for the terrific performance in the action sequences, which are the film's highlights\\". G. Ragesh of Malayala Manorama awarded 3.5 in a scale of 5 and said: \\"Pranav Mohanlal, perhaps, could not have waited for a better cinematic package than Aadhi to mark his entry to Malayalam cinema as a lead actor. The Jeethu Joseph directorial offers everything that a film in the populist mold can offer and explore all aspects of Pranav's acting skills\\" and \\"at the center of the narrative is a convincing performance by Pranav as an innocent young dreamer as well as a courageous and smart parkour expert\\". Describing the film \\"a thrilling ride\\", Sify critic rated 3 out of 5 and wrote: \\"Aadhi is an entertaining journey of a youth, who gives you some edge of the seat moments with his action skills ... In a role that demands tremendous acrobatic skills, Pranav Mohanlal makes a confident debut as a hero. He performs in a dedicated way and is a delight to watch as he unleashes his amazing athletic prowess\\" and \\"it's a rather simple storyline and Jeethu Joseph has evidently tried to keep the viewers engaged using a fast paced presentation\\". Manoj Kumar R. of The Indian Express awarded 3 out of 5 stars and stated that \\"Pranav's performance in action sequences is one of the mainstays in the film. Shot in real locations, Pranav draws applause for his skills in free running or popularly known as Parkour ... What makes this film works is Jeethu's equal distribution of responsibilities to each character to take the story forward. Even as Aadhi is a hero-centric film, Jeethu has treated Pranav's role as just the first among the equals\\". Deccan Chronicle critic also gave 3 stars out of 5 and said the film is \\"a high-octane, action- packed drama keeps audience, irrespective of ages, engaged. Pranav deserves one extra pat on the back for proving himself as a seasoned stuntman in his first movie outing\\". However, \\"the first half drags a bit\\". Deepa Soman of The Times of India also rated 3 out of 5 and said: \\"Pranav effortlessly portrays the soft-spoken, free-spirited Aadhi. He seems to have given his all for the numerous chasing and stunt scenes ... Aadhi deserves your time if you can look past the familiarity of the story, and want to enjoy a mix of Mohanlal nostalgia, stunts and the genuine efforts of a newbie actor to breathe life into his debut character\\".

Persian piano music () refers to piano pieces that are based on Persian traditional music or to pieces by Persian (Iranian) composers for the piano.  History  The first Piano arrived to Iran in 1805, in a cargo of gifts, which also included portraits, furniture and clocks, sent to the Persian Shah, Fath Ali Shah Qajar by Napoleon Bonaparte. It didn't receive attention as a proper instrument by the Iranian musicians at that time, was treated as a decorative object and forgotten where it was placed at the corner of a hall in Golestan palace. Techniques of piano performance with regard to Persian music, academia In 1866 for the first time a French company started selling pianos in Tehran, and this gradually increased the popularity of the instrument among Iranians. At that time one of the courtiers asked the renowned musician, Sarvar-ol-Molk, to go to his house and examine his newly purchased Piano. Sarvar-ol-Molk, who was a master Santoor player, found out that piano is similar to Santoor and works with the same logic. He then tuned the instrument based on the quadritone system of Dastgahs so that Persian songs could be played on it. Thrilled by Savar-ol-Molk's discovery, princess Esmat-od-Dowleh decided to learn the instrument as well. As it was inappropriate for an aristocratic women to be directly taught music by a man, she sent her black bondwoman to learn it from him, and each session bondwoman transferred to her what she had learned that day. The second person to learn the instrument was prince Azod-od-Dowleh, the son of the deceased king Fat'h Ali Shah, who was then 47. Techniques of piano performance with regard to Persian music, academiaMoayer, Dustali. Rejal-e Asr-e Naseri. Tehran: 1984, p.284. Towards the end of the nineteenth century an Iranian form of playing the Piano was formed. In this style left hand mainly played the octaves, bases or simply doubles the voice of the right hand. It also found its own innovative types of tunes, namely Rast-Kook and Chap-kook, which made the instrument compatible with the traditional scales. Lemaire Alfred Jean Baptiste Lemaire (1842-1907), then the Director of Music in the Persian army, was the first to compose Persian music for piano based on the classical European rules. He primarily drew upon the Iranian form of playing the Piano, but, with incorporating classical composing methods of harmonisation and variation, broke free from it at the same time. Such integration sounded uncanny and unauthentic to the Iranian musician and in their works they had tried to stay away of that. Lemaire's book, titled Avaz et Tasnif Persans, covered four of Dastgahs published in Paris and was enthusiastically received in Europe. Throughout the twentieth century Piano became more integrated with the classical Persian music and appeared in the ensemble playing, accompanying Sehtar, Tombak and Kamanche. The key musicians of the Iranian piano at this period were Motamed-ol-Molk Yahya'ian, Moshir- Homayoun Shahrdar, Morteza Mahjubi and Javad Maroufi. Mahjubi and Maroufi brought about the most significant changes in Iranian piano and each developed their own techniques, the style of former being recognised more as classical and the latter as modern and hybrid. Techniques of piano performance with regard to Persian music, academia Mahjubi Mahjubi (1900-1965) in addition to being a composer and player, was a great tuner as well. It was known that he always had his hammer with himself to change the tune of Piano or fine tune during a recording session or prior to a performance. His main effort was to offer an equivalent for the timbre and preformative qualities of traditional instruments, including Santoor and Sehtar. He had developed a new method for the use of pedals and translated the Persian music ornamental motifs for the piano. Techniques of piano performance with regard to Persian music, academia Mahjubi used the Reez technique - which is a common technique among Tar players, meaning a fast repetition of a note - but has modified it by playing on two intervals, most commonly the third and eight intervals, instead of on a single note. The trill sound produced in result has a similar impression to the sound of Persian string instrument and can easily accompany and respond to the vocal. His other invention is the Persian Ambience, which is produced when a note is played with a single rapid alternation of the note above. This method is known in the Persian music as Dorrab. He also achieved a sound quality similar to Tahrir - which a sobbing kind of vocal embellishment - through the use of ascending or descending arrays of trills. His other technique, named as Eshareh Ve Tekeih, which is literary translated as lean and pointing, was also commonly used before, specially in Avaz and Santoor. He also integrated the technique of Khafeh Kardan, which in western music is known as Damping, to piano by applying a very subtle damper pedal. The main feature of Mahjubi's style was his innovating notation. He never used the Modern European notation but instead used his self-invented method, which was writing the name of the notes in Persian alphabet, without the use of staff. The duration of the notes was also not indicated and had to be learned by memorising the rhythm. In contrast, he used an extended set of symbols to emphasise different dynamics and articulations, for instance + to indicate rest, ( ) to point out a complete repetition of the whole measure and b to show that the note should played on Black key. This notations was registered as a National Cultural Heritage of Iran (UNESCO) in 2013 by Pooyan Azadeh.BBC Persian reported the first research in Persian piano music done by Dr. Pooyan Azadeh Mahjubi was able to tune the piano both on Chap-kook and Rast-kook, but normally he switched between an array of different tunes in a performance, based on the Dastgah he would play in. Techniques of piano performance with regard to Persian music, academia According to Esamil Navab Safa, Mahjubi's performance style was improvisational, and he never planned or prepared for his performances, and if he played a piece ten times he would play it differently each time. Mahjubi taught several students, including princess Azarmidokht Malek-Mansoor, Mrs. Fakhri Malekpour and Mrs. Turandokht Sane'i. His most notable pupil is Fakhri Malekpour, who was trained under Mahjubi for twelve years and ever since has dedicated her life to passing down the method of his teacher to the younger generation. She do so through teaching young children, performing music and publishing CDs and books. Being solely motivated by her love of music, she never asks for money in return. Techniques of piano performance with regard to Persian music, academia Maroufi Maroufi (1912-1993) born into the family of the former prime-minister Mirza Ali Asghar Khan Amin al-Soltan and his parents were both renowned musicians. His style differs from Mahjubi, in that he was interested in the music of modernism and works of Debussy and Ravel, and has drawn inspirations from the aforementioned. He wrote his harmonic lines based on the western standards, while achieving a Persian mood at the same time; so his compositions are a balance which are neither western classical in charterer, nor too foreign for the western ear. His left hands includes minor, major, diminished, dominants, dominant sevenths and rarely dominant ninths chords. His harmonies are colourful and various in form, as he uses different types of Arpeggios. His famous Arpeggio consists of four notes with quavers as the beginning and the end note, and two semiquaver at the middle, while the more complicated ones incorporate trills or triplets. He used the simple chord progression and never altered modulation or secondary dominants. His mostly applied chord is I---III ---V---I. His melodic lines follow the classical rules of Variation. He doesn't use complex variations, and doesn't think of variation as a goal within itself; rather he employs a simple altering of the melody line as far as it helps to a more pleasant feeling of the piece. Unlike Mahjubi, he adopted the modern notation. Maroufi was a great teacher as well and has trained numerous musicians who has perused and developed his style up until the present.

Biography  Raza had been tasked with returning pieces of debris from Malaysian Airlines Flight 370, which vanished on March 8, 2014 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, with 239 crew and passengers on board. A wreck hunter, Blaine Gibson, has claimed that the murder took place in an effort to hinder the investigation into the plane's disappearance. Gibson also claims he has been subject to death threats, which he says are related to his investigative efforts. A representative of the Independent Group, which has been following the disappearance of MH370, said the timing of Houssenaly‚Äôs death was ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù as he had been scheduled to visit the Malagasy transport ministry to retrieve the debris and return it to Malaysia. The representative noted that Houssenaly was of French Malagasy nationality, and added that the diplomat's death had been met with ‚Äústony silence‚Äù from both French and Malaysian authorities. The diplomat's car was riddled with bullets, and a French news agency has speculated that he had been killed as revenge for his alleged involvement in the 2009 abduction of several residents of Indo-Pakistani descent. Other sources have denied this, and note that he was not convicted of any crime related to that incident. Malaysia‚Äôs foreign ministry said Houssenaly was first appointed Malaysia‚Äôs Honorary Consul in Madagascar in December 2013 for a three-year term ‚Äì and this was recently extended to December 2019.

It was published on August 24, 2017 in the United Kingdom and on September 12, 2017 in the United States. The book, which is set in New York City and Israel, is dedicated to Krauss's fatherKrauss's father grew up partly in Israel. and its title is derived from the opening lines of Dante's Inferno, as translated by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. \\"Midway upon the journey of our life I found myself within a forest dark, For the straightforward pathway had been lost.\\" Its chief characters are lawyer Jules Epstein, who is wealthy, divorced and retired, and Nicole, an internationally acclaimed novelist and mother of two sons who is in a failing marriage. Plot Jules Epstein, a wealthy retiree, goes missing in Tel Aviv to the distress of his three children. Prior to his disappearance triggered perhaps by the death of his parents, and his divorce from his wife, Epstein had been in the process of giving away both his money and his earthly possessions. Meanwhile, in New York City, novelist Nicole is living a crisis herself as she is aware that her marriage is failing but cannot find it within herself to work on saving it. After hearing a program on the radio in which a physicist explains the concept of the multiverse Nicole begins to wonder if all life is not dreamed up from one location, believing that her location could be the Hilton Tel Aviv where she and her family have visited frequently. After her father's cousin tells her of a man who died there, Nicole abruptly makes the decision to go the hotel herself as research for a new novel. Reception The novel's title is derived from the opening lines of Dante's Inferno in which Dante is lost in a dark forest, shown here in this engraving by Gustave Dor√© The Financial Times describes it as a \\"richly layered tale of two lives\\" that explores \\"ideas of identity and belonging ‚Äì and the lure of the Tel Aviv Hilton\\". Maureen Corrigan, for NPR, said: \\"The two separate plotlines about these two questers ‚Äî Nicole and Epstein ‚Äî ultimately intersect, but that's the only predictable aspect of this scramble of a novel. There are digressions here into Franz Kafka, Ren√© Descartes, Sigmund Freud, fairy tales and film. Sections of the novel are walled off from each another, as disconnected as that row-after-row of rooms in the Tel Aviv Hilton. Readers should just go along for the choppy ride, because the pleasure of Krauss' writing isn't located in the story. Instead, it's the wayward precision of her language that draws us into the desert, 'the forest dark' and other contemplative places where illumination occurs.\\" Peter Orner in The New York Times said: \\"[o]ne of the beauties of this lucid and exhilarating book is that Krauss is unafraid, at times, to let it go where it will. Aspects of 'Forest Dark' will be familiar to readers of Krauss‚Äôs earlier books 'The History of Love' and 'Great House,' including a preoccupation with the writing process and a revelatory take on the ties that bind people separated by generations. Other qualities, like a consuming emphasis on disconnection ‚Äî on all that refuses to add up ‚Äî might come as a surprise\\". Francesca Angelini, writing in The Sunday Times, called it \\"a daring novel\\". The New Statesman described it as \\"an impressive meditation on identity and the human condition\\". Its reviewer, Douglas Kennedy, said: \\"Forest Dark, which comes seven years after [Krauss's] last book, Great House, is that rare species: a novel of ideas in which the cerebral never impinges on the human mess that underscores the external and internal landscapes of a riveting narrative... This is as original and impressive a work of fiction as I have encountered in years; a welcome reminder of how a novel can be defiantly and brilliantly novel.\\" Emily St. John Mandel, reviewing the book for The Guardian, praised it as being \\"a brilliant achievement\\", saying \\"There have been a great many novels about writing novels and it‚Äôs a difficult trick to pull off, but it‚Äôs testament to Krauss‚Äôs formidable skill as a writer that this one feels entirely original.\\" Francesca Segal, writing in the Financial Times, described it as \\"a richly layered masterpiece; creative, profound, insightful, deeply serious, effortlessly elegant, both human and humane. Krauss is a poet and a philosopher, and this latest work does what only the very best fiction can do ‚Äì startles, challenges and enlightens the reader, while showing the familiar world anew\\". Sarah Hughes, reviewing the book for the i newspaper, described Forest Dark as \\"a novel of ideas that is impossible to put down\\". However, Kirkus Reviews described it as an \\"ambitiously high- concept tale that mainly idles in a contemplative register\\". Its reviewer said that \\"much of the drama [Krauss] establishes for her two characters feels dry, with her riffs on Kafka and Judaism more essayistic than novelistic. And though the novel never promised high drama, its low boil makes it harder to inspire the reader to draw connections within her braided narrative.\\" Notes References External links * Author Nicole Krauss on life, literature and her new book Forest Dark McGlone, Jackie (August 25, 2017).

Early life LaSalle \\"Sallie\\" Corbell was born in Chuckatuck, Virginia, on May 16, 1843, the daughter of David John Corbell and Elizabeth Phillips, slaveholders and plantation owners near Suffolk. She attended the Lynchburg Female Seminary in Lynchburg, Virginia. Career Mrs. Pickett, after 1910 Pickett obtained a professorship in belles-lettres and taught French, Latin and piano in Sherbrooke, Canada. She also sold her jewelry to maintain the family. After General Ulysses S. Grant insisted that the cartel which granted privileges to her husband should be honored, General Pickett and his family returned to their home in Virginia. Pickett accepted a position with the New York Life Insurance Company in Norfolk, with a large salary. Her husband died of scarlet fever in 1875. She received donations from across the Southern United States, and a subscription was started with eight-thousand dollars from one State, and pledges of thousands more. Hearing of that plan to provide her with financial security, Pickett resolutely declined to accept financial aid, and soon obtained a position as a government clerk in the Federal Pensions Office sufficient to support herself and son. In the 1880s, she became a popular writer and speaker. Her first book was published in 1899, \\"Pickett and His Men\\". Between 1899 and 1931 she toured America and wrote for Cosmopolitan, McClure's and other popular magazines; and published a dozen books. In 1891, after recovering from an accident, she was threatened with total blindness. With health broken and the almost total loss of her sight, she retained her position in the clerical service of the government. Personal life General Pickett and LaSalle Corbell Pickett, 1863 Sallie Corbell married Gen. George Pickett on September 15, 1863, a short time after his famous charge at Gettysburg. They had two sons: George Edward Pickett (1864-1911), who died at sea returning from the Philippines on an Army transport ship, and David Corbell Pickett (1866-1874), who died in childhood. When the war was over, fearing retaliation for his hanging of 22 Union soldiers, the General and his wife went to Canada for a year, living at the St. Laurent Hotel in Montreal. She died on March 22, 1931, and was originally buried at Abbey Mausoleum, Arlington National Cemetery, due to the fact that women weren't allowed to be buried in the Confederate section of Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia. In 1998 she was reinterred in front of her husband.

After the death of Sir Richard Cocks in the late 18th century the Hall fell into disrepair and was eventually demolished c1780. In 1830 the agriculturalist Edward Holland employed George Stanley Repton to build the present Hall using the local Cotswold stone. The Hall was completed in 1832. Elizabeth Gaskell, the novelist and cousin of Edward Holland, was a frequent visitor to the Hall.Pollard, Arthur \\"Mrs. Gaskell: Novelist and Biographer\\", 24.

The German Ambassador Joachim von Ribbentrop was invited to stay at Dumbleton. During the Second World War the Hall was allegedly considered as a suitable alternative venue for the House of Lords. In the 1940s the Women's Land Army were billeted on the top floor of the Hall. The Hall became a private hotel in 1959 when it was purchased by the Post Office Fellowship of Remembrance for the benefit of its members for the sum of ¬£180,000. In 1960 the Hall opened to provided holiday facilities to Post Office employees. It was funded as a living memory to those men and women of the Post Office who had died in the First and Second World Wars. A memorial garden was laid out in the former swimming pool area. Books of Remembrance listing all 12,830 postal workers killed in the two world wars were kept at the Hall, but these are now on permanent display at the Postal Museum in London. Today The Hall has been open to the general public as a hotel since 1996 under the trading name of Classic Hotels, although it remains under the ownership of the Post Office Fellowship of Remembrance.

The line was operated by the Great Western Railway and absorbed by that company on 2 August 1898. Originally it had a single passenger platform on the up side and a goods loop without a platform; the connections were operated by ground frame. In 1937 the facilities were considerably extended, with a full crossing facility for passenger trains and longer platforms on both lines, as well as a loop line behind the up platform and a large goods yard. In 1941 the station's goods sidings were further modified and extended in connection with airfield construction in the locality, and a new signal box with a lever frame that had been relocated from the Cornish Main Line at St Germans. A second, metal, bridge was also built at this time to carry the road over the new goods yard access lines. A camping coach was positioned here by the Western Region from 1958 to 1962. Due to the line's \\"uncoloured\\" classification, heavy locomotives such as GWR Classes 43XX 2-6-0 Tender Engine and 51XX 2-6-2T Tank Engines were allowed as far as Nancegollan only. Although larger locomotives did run past Nancegollan in the branch's dying days the Class 22s ran on the branch even though they were a GWR blue classification, higher than the branch line. In April 1957, Nancegollan won ¬£10 (¬£238.65 in today's money) in the British Railways Western Region Station Gardens Competition. The branch was closed for passengers on 5 November 1962.

It lasted from mid-August until early September 2017, with many records for rainfall and landfall intensity set during that time. The eighth named storm, third hurricane, and first major hurricane of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Harvey originated from a broad area of low pressure southwest of Cape Verde that was first monitored on August 13\\\\. Tracking steadily westward, the disturbance developed strong convection, a well-defined circulation, and sustained tropical storm- force winds, leading to the classification of Tropical Storm Harvey late on August 17\\\\. Moderate easterly vertical wind shear kept Harvey weak, as it continued westwards into the Caribbean Sea; despite repeated predictions for gradual intensification by the National Hurricane Center, Harvey eventually opened up into a tropical wave on August 19\\\\. The remnants of Harvey continued to move westwards and reached the Yucat√°n Peninsula on August 22, and were forecast to regenerate into a tropical cyclone after exiting land. On August 23, Harvey moved into the Bay of Campeche and quickly developed a well-defined circulation, becoming a tropical depression later that day and a tropical storm fifteen hours later. Curving northwestwards into a favorable environment with low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures, Harvey began to consolidate and developed an eye. Rapid intensification ensued as Harvey approached the coast of Texas, with Harvey becoming a hurricane in the afternoon of August 24\\\\. Despite some dry air entrainment halting the intensification process for the rest of the day, Harvey soon resumed strengthening and became the season's first major hurricane in the evening of August 25\\\\. Continuing to deepen, Harvey attained peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 km/h)‚ÄîCategory 4 status on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale‚Äîand a minimum pressure of 937 mbar (hPa; 27.67 inHg), as it made its first landfall near Rockport, Texas at 03:00 UTC on August 26\\\\. This made Harvey the first major hurricane to make landfall in the United States since Wilma in 2005, the first major hurricane in Texas since Bret in 1999, and the strongest in Texas since Carla in 1961. Rapid weakening began as Harvey made a second landfall just north of Holiday Beach three hours after its first, degrading to a tropical storm that evening. Trapped between two ridges to its west and east, Harvey dramatically slowed as it moved inland, but began drifting southeast back towards water on August 27\\\\. Harvey reemerged over the extreme western Gulf of Mexico as a weak tropical storm early on August 28; by this time almost of rain had fallen in the Greater Houston area. Moving slowly east-southeastwards, Harvey would bring an additional of rain to Greater Houston and parts of southwestern Louisiana over the next three days, becoming the wettest tropical cyclone on record in the United States. Eventually, a trough moving over the Ohio Valley pulled Harvey northwards, and Harvey made a third and final landfall just west of Cameron, Louisiana, on August 30 before weakening into a tropical depression. Continuing to push inland, Harvey gradually lost tropical characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 1\\\\. Origins and track through the Caribbean Tropical Storm Harvey over the Windward Islands on August 18 On August 12, a tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa, accompanied by a large area of convection. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) began to track the wave the next morning, just before the convective mass dissipated. The tropical wave was expected to merge with a broad area of low pressure located southwest of Cape Verde and slowly consolidate, with the NHC giving a low chance of tropical cyclogenesis over the next five days. The merger failed to complete, however, with the two areas of disturbed weather remaining separate despite being contained by the same area of low pressure. The two systems eventually split again on August 15, with the original low-pressure area continuing westwards towards the Caribbean Sea while the tropical wave moved farther north. Conditions in the Caribbean Sea though were not forecast to be conducive for development. Convection around the low began to increase that same day as a Kelvin wave passed through the area, but remained disorganized amid strong upper-level winds. However, the NHC noted that the low could experience a slight reprieve near the Lesser Antilles. On August 17, satellite imagery revealed that the system had become much more organized, with the circulation becoming better defined. Assessing it as having a high chance of tropical cyclogenesis over the next two days, the NHC began issuing advisories at 15:00 UTC on Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine roughly east of Barbados; this allowed tropical cyclone warnings and watches to be issued for the Lesser Antilles. Post-analysis revealed that a tropical depression had already formed by 06:00 UTC while located east of Barbados. The remnants of Harvey in the Gulf of Honduras on August 21, within the shadow of a total solar eclipse. An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigating the disturbance from 18:00‚Äî21:00 UTC on August 17 detected a well-defined circulation center with strong convection sheared to the west. With the system already producing maximum sustained winds near 40 mph (65 km/h), the disturbance was immediately upgraded to a tropical storm and given the name Harvey. With Harvey moving due west at in an environment of moderate easterly vertical wind shear, the intensity forecast remained challenging; statistical and hurricane models called for Harvey to near or reach hurricane intensity, while the global models, most notably the ECMWF and the GFS, showed Harvey degenerating to a tropical wave within the next few days. Meanwhile, on August 18, Harvey's center passed over Barbados at 10:00 UTC and over Saint Vincent at 15:00 UTC with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) and a central pressure of 1,004 mbar (hPa; 29.65 inHg); both islands received little impact as Harvey's strongest winds were located well to the north. The latter scenario eventually played out as Harvey remained disorganized, with the low- and mid-level circulations becoming misaligned. In fact, a reconnaissance aircraft flying through Harvey on the next day was unable to find a closed mid-level circulation, although the low-level circulation remained intact. By 12:00 UTC on August 19, Harvey had degraded to a tropical depression. The weakening circulation opened up into a wave six hours later. Despite subsiding vertical wind shear ahead, Harvey's quick motion and proximity to dry air were expected to hinder reintensification for the time being. However, the NHC noted the possibility of Harvey regenerating near the Yucat√°n Peninsula or in the Bay of Campeche. Regeneration and rapid intensification Harvey shortly after regeneration in the Bay of Campeche on August 23 On the morning of August 20, the NHC began to feature the remnants of Harvey on their Tropical Weather Outlooks, assessing it with a medium chance of redevelopment over the next five days. However, this was increased to high just hours later after showers and thunderstorms associated with the system increased in coverage. The system regained winds of tropical storm-force later on August 20, yet a closed circulation still could not be found. Harvey's remnant trough continued to move steadily westwards to west-northwestwards towards Belize and the Yucat√°n Peninsula through August 21, passing over the latter on August 22. As the low- pressure area associated with ex-Harvey moved over land, its circulation became better defined, and the NHC noted that tropical cyclone development was almost a certainty over the next few days as the system entered the Bay of Campeche. At this time, the NHC also mentioned the possibility of hurricane- force winds affecting the coast of Texas. The NHC's forecasts came to fruition at 12:00 UTC on August 23 as Harvey regenerated into a tropical depression 175 mi (280 km) west of Progreso, Mexico, after the presence of a closed circulation was finally confirmed. Satellite animation of Harvey as it rapidly intensified near the Texas coast on August 25 Over the next few hours, Harvey continued to consolidate, with the radius of maximum winds decreasing to 70 mi (110 km) early on August 24. Moving slowly northwestwards to north- northwestwards in response to a weak ridge to the northeast, Harvey intensified to a tropical storm at 04:00 UTC. By that time, Harvey was located 440 mi (705 km) southeast of Port O'Connor, Texas. Further strengthening was anticipated, as wind shear over Harvey decreased with the weakening of an upper-level low over the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. In fact, the NHC assessed that the probability of rapid intensification‚Äîsustained winds increasing by 35 mph (55 km/h) in 24 hours‚Äîincreased to 45 percent just five hours after Harvey had been declared a tropical storm. This forecast materialized shortly afterwards as Harvey began rapidly strengthening, with reconnaissance aircraft monitoring the storm at around 14:00 UTC reporting the structure had \\"markedly improved\\": a eye had developed and the central pressure had fallen to 982 mbar (hPa; 28.99 inHg). This resulted in a substantial increase in the intensity forecast, with the cyclone expected to be a powerful hurricane by the time it reached the Texas coastline. Less than two hours later, at 18:00 UTC, Harvey was upgraded to a mid-range Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale based on additional aircraft data. Afterwards, the intensification process stalled somewhat and the eye lost some definition, despite a steady decrease in the central pressure. This was attributed to likely dry air entrainment. Early on August 25, however, strengthening resumed again, with Harvey attaining Category 2 intensity at roughly 05:00 UTC that day. During this time, the satellite presentation improved significantly with the appearance of an intermittent eye feature embedded in a central dense overcast (CDO), as well as improving outflow. However, shortly afterwards, concentric eyewalls were reported within Harvey‚Äîsignifying an eyewall replacement cycle‚Äîwhich prevented the sustained winds from increasing beyond 110 mph (175 km/h) for a while despite an unusually low pressure of 947 mbar (hPa; 27.97 inHg), which is typical of a stronger storm. Despite this, Harvey managed to quickly strengthen into a major hurricane‚Äîa storm with winds of 111 mph (179 km/h) or greater‚Äîat 19:00 UTC that day. Rapid strengthening eventually culminated with Harvey reaching peak sustained winds of 130 mph (215 km/h)‚Äîa Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale‚Äîat 23:00 UTC, as a well-defined eye formed within the hurricane. The pressure bottomed out at 937 mbar (hPa; 27.67 inHg) hours later at 03:00 UTC on August 26, just as it was making landfall on San Jos√© Island. Texas landfalls and subsequent stalling Harvey shortly after emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on August 28 Harvey officially made landfall at 03:00 UTC on August 26 on the northern end of San Jos√© Island, 6 mi (9 km) east of Rockport, Texas, at its peak strength. This made Harvey the first storm to strike the United States at Category 3 intensity or higher since Hurricane Wilma in 2005, the strongest in terms of wind speed to hit the country since Charley in 2004, and the first hurricane to strike Texas since Ike in 2008. Harvey also became the first major hurricane in the state since Bret in 1999, as well as the strongest in Texas since Carla in 1961. A storm surge of was recorded between Port Aransas and Matagorda. Weakening began as the eye of Harvey moved further inland, and Harvey made a subsequent landfall on the northeastern shore of Copano Bay at 06:00 UTC with slightly lower winds of 125 mph (205 km/h). The weakening process accelerated as it slowly progressed northwest, with Harvey falling to minimal hurricane strength by 15:00 UTC as the central inner core collapsed and the eye disappeared from visible satellite imagery. Harvey's movement slowed to a crawl as the cyclone became trapped between two ridges to its east and west, which generated light steering currents that prevented any fast movement. Later that day, Harvey weakened to a tropical storm as the central convection continued to warm. As Harvey barely moved and continued dropping rain, catastrophic and record- breaking flooding occurred in the southeastern portion of the Lone Star state. During this time, a total of 52 tornadoes were produced, half of which occurred within or near Greater Houston. The strongest was rated EF2 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, which touched down near Evangeline, Louisiana on the evening of August 29\\\\. All of the other tornadoes were ranked at EF0 or EF1 intensity. By late on August 27, the cyclone completed an anticyclonic loop and began a slow southeastward drift towards the Gulf of Mexico; at this time Harvey was only a minimal tropical storm. Deep convection formed repeatedly in Harvey's right semicircle as it had remained over water, which likely helped the system to sustain tropical-storm-force winds despite being centered over land. Still moving slowly, Harvey emerged back over water into Matagorda Bay late on August 28. Once back over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, deep convection blossomed well to the north of the center of the tropical storm, which led to slight strengthening. The center of the storm continued to drift to the east-southeast into the early hours of August 29, but never strayed more than 70 mi (110 km) away from the Texan coast. Convection blossomed again later that day, with the center jumping northwards into the convection as Harvey began moving to the northeast. Consequently, Harvey's winds reached a third and final peak of 50 mph (85 km/h) at 18:00 UTC. As a ridge built over the western Atlantic, Harvey began to be steered north-northeastwards back towards the United States coast. Strong vertical wind shear weakened the storm somewhat as it approached the coast of Louisiana, though the central pressure continued to fall to around 990 mbar (hPa; 29.23 inHg). Rainfall and flooding event Beaumont and Houston Owing to Harvey's slow motion near and over Texas and Louisiana from 26‚Äì30 August, prolonged heavy rainfall and resulting widespread record-breaking and catastrophic flooding was observed in many parts of the two states, especially within the Houston metropolitan area. Harvey's combination with a weak stationary front located over the Southern United States resulted in baroclinic enhancement of heavy rains in that region. Warm moist air wrapping round the east side of Harvey's circulation converged with cooler and drier air and rose in a process known as isentropic lifting, creating prolonged heavy rains. As a result, the NHC declared Harvey \\"the most significant tropical cyclone rainfall event in United States history\\". The highest rainfall accumulations totaled over , with a reading of at Nederland, Texas and another of near Groves, Texas. This well surpassed the previous records for tropical cyclone rainfall for both the continental United States, which was held by 1978's Tropical Storm Amelia, as well as for the entire United States, which was held by 1950's Hurricane Hiki. Rain rates of up to per hour contributed greatly to breaking daily and even monthly rainfall records in the region. The weather station at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport observed all-time record daily rainfall accumulations on both August 26 and 27, measured at and respectively. The total of of rain in August, mostly from Harvey, made that month the wettest ever recorded in Houston, more than doubling the previous record of . Besides Houston, nearly the entirety of southeastern Texas received at least of rain, and an estimated 25‚Äì30 percent of Harris County‚Äîabout of land‚Äîwas submerged. Louisiana was not spared by Harvey's rains, with peak accumulations at recorded west of Vinton, though radar data indicated that up to of rain likely fell. Elsewhere, Harvey also caused significant flooding in Tennessee where about a foot of rain was recorded. Final landfall and dissipation The center of Harvey crossed the coast near Cameron, Louisiana, at 08:00 UTC on August 30 with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) and a central pressure of 991 mbar (hPa; 29.26 inHg). As the storm moved farther inland, weakening commenced once again and Harvey weakened to a tropical depression at 00:00 UTC on August 31. Consequently, the NHC issued its last advisory on the cyclone three hours later, with further information to be handled by the Weather Prediction Center (WPC). While continuing to generate heavy rainfall, Harvey began to lose its tropical characteristics, ultimately transitioning into an extratropical cyclone at 06:00 UTC on September 1 over the Tennessee Valley. Eventually, what was left of Harvey weakened to the point where the WPC terminated advisories on the storm, which it did at 15:00 UTC the next day. The remnants continued moving northeastwards while interacting with a developing low-pressure area over the Mid-Atlantic, dissipating shortly afterwards over northern Kentucky.

He is the author of leading publications in his field (see selected bibliography). In 2011 he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George (KCMG) for services to human rights, democracy and the rule of law in Europe. He is a Bencher of Middle Temple and holds honorary degrees from the Universities of Athens, Ritsumeikan, Cape Town and Paris 2. He is an Honorary Fellow of University College London and Hertford College Oxford. In 2016 he was awarded the National Order of the Southern Cross by the President of Brazil for his contribution to constitutionalism and the rule of law internationally. He has variously been listed as one of The Time's 100 most influential lawyers. Jeffrey has held a number of public appointments including Non-Executive Director of the Office of Rail Regulation; Member of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution; Chair of the British Waterways Ombudsman Committee, Chair of the Council of the Institute for Philanthropy, and Trustee of a number of charities. He is a member of the Foreign Secretary's Advisory committee on Human Rights. Between 2000 - 2011 he was the UK's member of the Council of Europe's Commission for Democracy through Law (\\"The Venice Commission\\").  Professional Life  Sir Jeffrey‚Äôs professional career includes a mix of academic scholarship, academic and other administration, and practice as a barrister and constitutional advisor.  Scholarship  Jeffrey has produced leading publications on a number of legal issues, but his principal work can be divided into four strands. His first published paper made the case for laws against racial and religious discrimination at a time when the UK had none. That paper (which influenced the campaign to introduce anti-discrimination laws in the mid-sixties) also dealt with the institutional means to achieve the most effective implementation of such laws (rejecting a criminal approach). This interest in institutional design led to his second major area of interest, the merits and demerits of judicial control of administrative discretion, challenging the widely held view at that time that such as welfare recipients had no rights to challenge decisions to grant or refuse their benefits.Jowell, J. The Legal Control of Administrative Discretion Public Law, 1973. Law and Bureaucracy , 1975. He then turned to a third issue, neglected at the time, of the extent to which judges could interfere with the substance of, rather than the procedure by which, decisions are made by public bodies (under the notions of ‚Äòunreasonableness‚Äô and ‚Äòproportionality‚ÄôJowell, J. and Lester A, Beyond Wednesbury: Substantive Principles of Administrative Law. Public Law, 1987.). This was followed by work on the related issue of ‚Äòjudicial deference‚Äô more generally.Such as, Jowell, J. What Decisions Should Judges Not Take? Tom Bingham and the Transformation of the Law, eds M. Andenas and D. Fairgrieve, OUP, p. 129. After his involvement in the drafting process of the South African constitution,See D. Cowan and D. Visser, The University of Cape Town Law Faculty (2004) p.83, where it is stated at p.83 that ‚ÄúJeffrey Jowell, a former student, was to play an important role in the creation of the new South African order during the 1990s‚Äù. he turned to a fourth issue: the extent to which constitutional principles or rights could be implied in the UK‚Äôs uncodified constitution, and their content. In particular, whether the concepts of equalityJowell, J. Is Equality a Constitutional Principle? Current Legal Problems, 1994, p.1. and the rule of lawJowell, J. The Rule of Law, in J. Jowell and C. O‚ÄôCinneide, The Changing Constitution, 8th ed. OUP 2019, p.3. are inherent components of the UK and constitution, and indeed whether they are a necessary component of any constitutional democracy. In 1993, Jeffrey joined Lord Woolf as joint author of the leading text, de Smith‚Äôs Judicial ReviewOriginally: ‚ÄòJudicial Review of Administrative Action‚Äô. (then in its third edition, now in its eighth2019, Thomson Reuters.), which proved to be an important channel through which to advance his ideas to the practising profession.  Academic Administration  During the course of his academic career Jeffrey was, on two occasions, Dean of University College London‚Äôs Law FacultyFrom 1981-9, and then from 2000-2003. In between, he was a Vice Provost of UCL and Head of its Graduate School, where he advocated its new School of Public Policy. In both roles he advanced programmes to make UCL more connected to London intellectual life and to involve practitioners and judges in its legal work. He was one of the first law deans to engage in successful fundraising, concentrating on developing the Faculty into a leading international centre of comparative law, with the opportunity for students to study in the great universities of Europe and elsewhere. This attracted great scholars, such as Professor Ronald Dworkin, to UCL‚Äôs Law Faculty, which was consistently rated as one of the top law schools in the country. In 2010 Jeffrey was appointed the inaugural Director of the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law, which soon established itself as a significant centre for the study and promotion of the rule of law, involving issues such as devolution, closed trials, schools programmes, immigrants‚Äô rights, the rule of law in Parliament etc. The Centre also worked on rule of law matters abroad, in countries such as Myanmar, Bahrain and Turkey.  Practice and advice  Jeffrey has always combined his academic life with practice at the English Bar, in Blackstone Chambers. He advises over a broad range of public law and human rights issues, particularly in relation to the powers and accountability of public officials. He has appeared in the UK Supreme Court, the Privy Council, and also the courts of countries such as Malawi, the Southern African Development Community Tribunal in Namibia, in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. As one of a small number of experts on the drafting of national constitutions, he has been involved in the constitutions of South Africa, the Cayman Islands, the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Georgia, and elsewhere. He also advises on the constitutions of a number of British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies. As the UK‚Äôs member on the Venice Commission (the Council of Europe‚Äôs Commission for Democracy Through Law) he advised on the constitutions and public law of a number of countries in Central and Eastern Europe and the Balkans, chairing the committee which produced the Commission‚Äôs influential document on The Rule of LawEuropean Commission for Democracy Through law, report on the Rule of Law, CDL-AD (2011) Report on the Rule of Law..  Personal Life  Sir Jeffrey was born on 4 November 1938 in Cape Town. He attended the University of Cape Town (BA. LL.B 1961), where he was active in the student resistance to the growing apartheid measures at that time. He then studied at Oxford University (MA 1963), where he was President of the Oxford Union, and at Harvard Law School (LLM 1966; SJD 1970). In 1963 he married Frances Suzman, an art historian, daughter of the physician Moses Suzman and Helen Suzman DBE (the longstanding South African Member of Parliament and campaigner against the apartheid regime). They have 2 children, Daniel Jowell QC and Joanna Jowell, and four grandchildren. Selected bibliography Jowell J., Lord Woolf et al,. de Smith's Judicial Review (8th ed. 2018). Thomson Reuters.

Irish seamen were previously represented by the British-based National Sailors' and Firemen's Union (NSFU) (led by the right-wing Havelock Wilson) and other unions. However the NSFU (which changed its name to the National Union of Seamen in 1926) fell into disrepute by its failure to observe the General Strike in 1926, among other things, and in September 1928 the NSFU was officially expelled from the Trades Union Congress. From the outset the Irish Seamen and Port Workers' Union campaigned for the establishment of an Irish Maritime Board, in opposition to the National Maritime Board (a bilateral board governing wages and working practices in the British shipping industry). The Irish Maritime Board was set up on 15 October, 1948.http://www.irishships.com/irish_seafarers__trade_union_or.html In 1951, the union had a victory in a wage claim, having rejected an initial Labour Court Recommendation. Around that time Des Branigan, seaman, archaeological diver and maritime historian, appeared on the scene and became involved in agitation dealing with Irish Shipping and the Irish Seamen and Port Workers‚Äô Union, among others. The union changed its name to the Marine, Port and General Workers Union (MPGWU) in 1955. In doing so, it hoped to focus on its shore-based members, particularly dockers. With the encouragement of the Congress of Irish Unions (CIU), in 1957 it formed the Irish Seamen's Union, which it hoped that the sailors in its membership would join. However, the new union was accused of being corrupt, and of being controlled by companies and political parties. The union was a failure, and was dissolved in 1959, its members and other seamen in the MPGWU leaving to form the new Seamen's Union of Ireland. The MPGWU followed the CIU into the new Irish Congress of Trade Unions in 1959, but it left in 1970. Its membership declined, falling to only 3,114 in 1989. In 1999, it merged into SIPTU.

History The growing demand for health care pushed the Kenyan Government to see the need to implement an effective health care system. With this in mind, the Kenyan Government held discussions with a leading Chinese Medical Corporation about the possibility of setting up a state-of-the-art medical facility in Kenya. A follow-up visit by the then Minister for Health, Hon. Charity Ngilu culminatedi n the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in 2005. A cabinet paper was then prepared and endorsed by Parliament in 2005. The Management of Kenyatta University led by Prof. Olive Mugenda conceptualised the hospital project in 2008 and embarked on writing a proposal for it. The proposed project would have innovative and unique research and treatment centres that would fill the gaps in medical service provision in Kenya. This proposal was presented to the Ministry of Health, appealing for funding to set up a Teaching, Research and Referral Hospital. With the support of the Kenyatta University Council, and the Government of Kenya through various Ministries and their Permanent Secretaries, the idea came to fruition with the signing of an M.O.U on Thursday, 21 April 2011 between the Chinese Government and the Government of Kenya. The then Minister of Finance and currently the President of the Republic of Kenya, H.E. Uhuru Kenyatta signed the M.O.U on behalf of the Government of Kenya, and Mr. Li Changchun, a member of the Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China on behalf of the People‚Äôs Republic of China. The signing was witnessed by the former President H.E. Mwai Kibaki at State House Nairobi. Construction The construction of this state of the art facility started in the year 2011. The construction process involved the creation of the hospital, a medical school, tuition block, student hostels, laboratories, staff quarters and Installation of modern medical equipment which was completed in 2016.  Opening of the hospital  Legal notice No. 4 of 2019 issued on 25 January 2019 created KUTRRH as a state corporation. After that, the KUTRRH Board of Directors was established, and the process of operationalising the hospital began. The hospital opened its doors for the patients on 28 October 2019.

Krzykowski in his feature debut, and starring Sam Elliott, Aidan Turner and Caitlin FitzGerald. The film debuted at the Fantasia Film Festival in Montreal, Canada, where it premiered on July 20, 2018. The US Premiere took place at the Plaza Classic Film Festival in El Paso, Texas on August 10, 2018. In the UK, it played at FrightFest London on August 26, 2018, in Spain at the Sitges Film Festival and in Finland at the Night Visions Film Festival. John Sayles and Douglas Trumbull are executive producers. Trumbull also provided special effects. Plot Set in 1987, the story is about Calvin Barr (Sam Elliott), an old man living his last days in his quiet hometown with his dog. Barr reminisces about his past with flashbacks showing that during World War II, he served as a special ops soldier on a mission to assassinate Adolf Hitler which he pulls off successfully, however the operation was classified and never revealed to the public. As Barr goes about his day-to-day routine, which includes visiting his brother Ed (Larry Miller) in his barbershop, he fights off a gang of thugs who try to steal his car and is followed around by a pair of mysterious men in a government car. The men eventually approach him identifying themselves as joint American and Canadian government agents. They explain that all life on Earth may be coming to an end as a strange virus has been killing people and animals in the Canadian wilderness and the original source of the virus is Bigfoot itself. Knowing Barr is a highly trained tracker and survivalist, and one of the few people on Earth immune to the virus, the agents try to recruit him to go into the wilderness and kill the Bigfoot in hopes it will end the epidemic. Barr hunts the Bigfoot, wounding him. After much tracking, he finds the Bigfoot dying. Barr chooses to burn the body rather than turn it over to the government, but the Bigfoot is still alive and then attacks Barr, maiming him. The two fight until Barr stabs the Bigfoot and ultimately shoots him to death. Barr lies back, seemingly dying from his wound. The screen fades to Barr's funeral as his brother gives a beautiful eulogy. Time passes and Ed goes fishing with Barr's dog. Secretly alive, Barr reappears and the two go fishing together. Barr later digs up his casket to retrieve an old box and walks home; the box's contents are never revealed.

He was a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University. He was previously the director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. Following his 2017 nomination to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the White House decided to forgo renominating Goodfriend at the beginning of the new term.Fed Nominee Nellie Liang Withdraws From Consideration He was known for his opposition to monetary instruments such as quantitative easing and bond buying programs. Education Goodfriend received a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Union College in 1972 before earning an M.A. (1977) and Ph.D. (1980) in economics from Brown University. Career From 2005 until his death, Goodfriend served as the Friends of Allan H. Meltzer Professor of Economics at Carnegie Mellon's Tepper School of Business. His teaching and research interests include macroeconomic fluctuations, monetary theory and policy, banking and financial markets, and economic development. Prior to his teaching career, from 1993 to 2005 he was director of research and policy advisor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. In this capacity, he regularly attended meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Washington, D.C. from 1993 to 2005. Before that, he was an economic advisor at the White House in 1984 and 1985. Goodfriend was frequently engaged with central banks such as the European Central Bank, Norges Bank, the Sveriges Riksbank, and the Swiss National Bank, and has been a visiting scholar at several of them. He was also engaged in teaching activities on monetary theory and policy in China, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and Switzerland. In November 2017, Goodfriend was nominated by President Donald Trump to fill one of the vacancies on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Fiscal policy positions Goodfriend has been described as conservativeUnexpected Opposition Imperils Federal Reserve NomineeWhy can‚Äôt conservatives just admit they were wrong about inflation?Trump's Fed nominees set to add 'balance' to central bank and was skeptical of monetary policy instruments that were employed by the Federal Reserve under Janet Yellen. He was a critic of an actively regulating role of the Fed and has repeatedly argued against the current form of quantitative easing as well as bond buying programs, especially the purchases of mortgage-backed securities. In 2008, Goodfriend warned that the Federal Reserve's actions would cause higher inflation; a prediction that never materialized. Asked at a Senate confirmation hearing for a seat on the Federal Reserve‚Äôs board of governors in January 2018 why he got his prediction wrong, Goodfriend did not give an explanation and instead spoke of the value of low inflation. Goodfriend agreed with Yellen regarding the aim of shrinking the Fed's $4.5-trillion balance sheet, much of which it acquired through bond buying programs. He supported a rules based monetary policy, which would limit the freedom of action of the Federal Reserve bank in favor of a more mathematically based approach. He has also been willing to consider unusual monetary instruments in times of crisis, such as negative rates as used by the Bank of Japan, European Central Bank, and other institutions in Europe. On March 16, 2017, Goodfriend testified before the Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade of the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Financial Services. His testimony was titled \\"The Fed Needs a Credible Commitment to Price Stability\\". He argued that the current commitment to price stability of the Fed lacks reliability. Memberships Goodfriend was a member of the Shadow Open Market Committee, an independent group of economists who strive for a new way of thinking about monetary politics. Goodfriend was co-editor with Stan Zin of the Carnegie Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy and has served on the editorial boards of the Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, the International Journal of Central Banking, and the Journal of Monetary Economics.

The vast majority of micro enterprises (over 99%) are run by only one individual. They can be found mainly in emerging markets where they help to foster economic growth. In France, running a microbusiness (as an auto-entrepreneur or micro- entrepreneur) implies abiding by a tax policy specifically designed for companies with low turnovers. This legal status is legally restricted to freelance workers and employers (FWE)‚Äî‚Äîretailers, artisans and a small number of professionals in private practice. This status is not subject to the usual Value-Added Tax (the State doesn't collect it and the company cannot claim it back) and prevents the company from any claim to governmental support programmes. Apart from these specifics, all microbusinesses abide by other FWE-targeted regulations.  Micro enterprises in France  Microbusinesses fall into two groups: trading activities or non-trading activities. The tax status of any given micro enterprise is checked and approved by the tax office. The method of taxation depends on the company's annual turnover, up to 32,000 EUR without VAT (or 80,000 EUR without VAT for retailers). Should a non-trading microbusiness fall into this tax status, the taxation is calculated over two thirds of the company's total sales over the year (regardless of the company's actual profits). Should a trading microbusiness fall into this tax status, the taxation is calculated using: * 29% of the company's total sales over the year (regardless of the company's actual profits) provided the company performs retailing operations; * 50% of the yearly turnover for all other activities. The microbusiness legal status was defined in Article 35 of the Economic Growth Incentive Law (published on 01/Aug/2003). Before the law, freelancers were expected to pay taxes either using the micro enterprise tax status defined in Article 50-0FR:Article 50-0 of the General Tax Code (GTC). of the General Tax Code or using the Special Declaratory Scheme defined in Article 102FR: Article 102 ter of the General Tax Code. of said General Tax Code. The provisions of the EGI law grant freelancers the ability to opt out of standard conditions for paying social contributions and charges (accounting provisions, regularization, minimum fees to start a business) in favour of the provisions defined in Article L 131-1 and Article L 136-3FR: Article L 131-6 and Article L 136-3 of the Social Security Code. of the Social Security Code (SSC). Article 102 ter of the GTC defines a special declaratory scheme for non-trading profits (classified as BNC, for b√©n√©fices non-commerciaux). This tax status is labelled \\"micro BNC\\". Profits from this status is exclusively restricted to people who do not earn more than 32,600 EUR exclusive of VAT over a calendar year (since 2011, the scheme should be valid up to 2013). In this situation, since 2006 the yearly Gross Operating Surplus (GOS) is minored by a 34% rate (was 37%). Article 50-0 of the GTC defines the microbusiness tax status for crafting/trading/industrial company benefits. In other words, for industrial and commercial benefits (classified as BIC, for b√©n√©fices industriels et commerciaux). This tax status is labelled \\"micro BIC\\" and restricted to companies with turnover limitations: * <82,200 EUR VAT-free for businesses selling goods, food (whether on premises or to take out) or housing services. In this situation, the GOS is minored by a 71% flat-rate reduction since 2006 (was 72%) * <32,900 EUR VAT-free in any other case of non-trading profit. Since 2006, this allows a 50% flat-rate reduction of the GOS (was 52%) Note: If the business deals with both types of activities, the total turnover of the company must not exceed 82,200 EUR and the turnover related to non-trading activities must not exceed 32,900 EUR. A minimum flat-rate reduction of 305 EUR is to be applied to the micro enterprise regardless of their tax status.

The status of Jadira in the sense defined by Tindale has been recently questioned by Paul Burke. Ascribed country Tindale described the tribal boundaries of some of land belonging to a 'Jadira' people, in the following terms.3,600 sq. The Jadira occupied the areas about the middle sections of the Cane and Robe rivers, running south of Mount Minnie, and as far north as the Fortescue River. Their eastern frontier putatively fell short of the western scarp of the higher plateau of the Hamersley Ranges. Tindale also added a list of alternative names for these Jadira: * Kawarindjari. Kawarandjari. * Kawarandari. * Kawarindjara. * Kauarind'arri, Kauarndhari. * Garindjari. These terms represented Ngarluma exonyma applied to the Jadira, and bore the sense of 'belonging to the west'. The only other information available to Tindale led him to suggest that some of the Jadira, a non-circumcising tribe, with the onset of European colonization, shifted eastwards to Ashburton Downs Station, while a second group moved to the mouth of the Fortescue River where they were assimilated into the Martuthinira. Traditionally, he added, their access to the coastal waters lay through Nhuwala (which Tindale spelt Noala) territory, between the Cane and Robe rivers, a practice Tindale described as 'trespassing'. Controversy Aboriginal Legal Aid lawyer and Land Council lawyer Paul Burke re-examined Tindale's papers and sources when, with regard to a native title claim, he had to work out the precise boundaries for another tribe in this area. He came to the conclusion that the Jadira people and their territory were a misnomer, a phantom category, inexplicably created by Tindale on otherwise very thin evidence. The primary source for Tindale's thesis lies in a single reference to the Kau'arndh√§ri in a 1914 paper by Daisy Bates, where Bates names it as one of four western Pilbara tribes ‚Äì the others being the Ngarluma, the Kariera, and the Martuthinira ‚Äì whose class system, governing marriages, is, she claimed, identical. Bates does not mention the Jadira, but Tindale drew the conclusion that it was the endonym of the Kau'arndh√§ri, on the basis of a report by Carl Georg von Brandenstein, who glossed the latter term by the former.

Louise Thomas M. \\"Minnie\\" Louise Russell Thomas (1861-1947) was the founder of Lenox Hall, a girls' school in St. Louis. Early life M. \\"Minnie\\" Louise Russell was born in 1861, the daughter of Judge Thomas Allen Russell (1834-1921), who was for some years a judge of the Circuit Court in St. Louis, and Martha Louisa Lenoir (1831-1913). Born during the war in Columbia, Missouri, and coming to live in St. Louis while a little girl, Louise Russell was educated in the public schools and graduated from the High School. The graduating exercises were held in a hall so spacious as to make it difficult to hear the essays, and the entertainment naturally became very monotonous to the audience. Russell said to herself, \\"when my turn comes I will make them hear me,\\" and she did. Her clear and well-modulated voice at once attracted the attention of the guests and she was well rewarded, for the applause was so great as to call for an encore. That was the beginning of her success as a speaker. Her gift was much in demand in public and social life. Russell attended the University of Missouri, where she won the gold medal awarded by the Press Association at their annual meeting for the greatest excellence in oratory. This was the first occasion which presented itself for asserting her belief for equal rights for women. The boys preferred to have two gold medals awarded, one for them and another for the girls, making the contests separate and apart. An indignation meeting was held by the girls. Having been subjected to the same rules they could see no reason for discrimination, wanting to come in on an equal footing on this competition as well as on the examinations. The rules were made over and the privilege granted. The winner was Minnie Louise Russell. She believed that all women should be permitted to enter any field of labor or study for which they feel fitted. Career University City. Teachers and students gathered in the rain on March 2, 1910 for the ground breaking ceremony. In this photograph which appeared in \\"The Woman's National Daily\\" on March 3, 1910, the group posed on the steps of the Woman's National Daily Building with their school pennants. Edward Gardner Lewis is in the front row on the right. Lenox Hall, a high-grade resident and day school for girls and young women, was established by M. Louise Thomas, the principal, in September 1907. The architects who were chosen for the great new Cathedral, Barnett, Haynes & Barnett designed the new Lenox Hall, in University City, and it was a perfect type of home for a girls' school. It was early English in type, and the entire building, together with its location‚Äîgiving a broad range of the open country‚Äîleaves nothing to be desired in providing ideal surroundings for the students. On coming to St. Louis to establish a school, a name could not be decided upon, and it was while walking with her father, discussing the question, that they came upon Lenox Place‚Äîa beautiful residence portion of the city. \\"Here\\" she said, \\"is a name, suitable, musical and short, and if it stands for someone great and good, we will adopt it.\\" Referring to the encyclopedia it was found that James Lenox was an American bibliophilist and philanthropist, founder of the Lenox Library in New York City for public reference, built in 1870. Later this was combined with the Astor and Tilden Libraries as the New York Public Library. On May 17, 1910, members of the Junior and Senior classes at Lenox Hall and their principal, Louise Thomas, were guests of Mabel Gertrude Lewis for a tour of University City, luncheon and an afternoon at Delmar Garden Amusement Park. In this photograph which appeared in \\"The Woman's National Daily\\" on May 18, 1910, Edward Gardner Lewis had joined the group for luncheon in the Delmar Pavilion. Lenox Hall was a private school for girls. Their new building in University City was scheduled to be ready in the fall of 1910. While Thomas was married every luxury and comfort was hers, but when it became necessary to support herself and two daughters, she obtained a position to teach in Hardin College and Conservatory of Music, Mexico, Missouri, where she could keep her children with her. There she established the course of lectures to girls which she calls \\"Round Table Talks\\" and which were continued in her school. Not being able to reach each girl individually in the classroom, she gave them the privilege of coming to her at stated times to talk over questions and matters which worried or puzzled them, such as morals, ethics, rules for social life, attitude toward those who were inclined to bad habits, etc. Remaining in the school for six years she felt that conditions made it advisable to enter a field of work where her ideals for girls' education could have freer scope. Two offers were made her, one to take charge of a girls' school in Montana, and another in St. Louis. She refused both‚Äî entertaining the idea of establishing such a one as would enable her to carry out her plans unrestrictedly. About that time Martha H. Matthews, who had been a very successful principal of Hosmer Hall in St. Louis, died, and she felt that this was her opportunity for establishing a school for girls. Without a pupil registered or one promised, she went ahead and opened Lenox Hall, engaging a splendid faculty and arranging a course of study covering all grades of college preparatory work; also selected a graduate of Pratt Institute for a full course in domestic science; established a full art course under competent teachers, and engaged instructors for piano, voice and violin. It was a daring thing to do, but she looked into the future and believed there would be a demand for such a school in this growing metropolis. Success came from the start. Every year it was necessary to add to the capacity of the institution, several buildings being rented to accommodate the resident pupils, until from the old home on Taylor and McPherson, the last move was made to the beautiful new building in University City, planned and devised in every detail by Thomas herself. Some discouraging experiences were hers after deciding to build this new school; she went to bankers, trust companies, rich women, and to everyone whom she thought might be influenced to build such a one as she would require, but not a single word of encouragement, satisfaction or assistance could she obtain until Mrs. Edward Gardner Lewis, the president of the American Woman's Republic (AWR), interested her husband, and he made it possible to carry out her plans. Lenox Hall's new building in University City was designed by Barnett, Haynes and Barnett. In this photograph taken of the north facade on Washington Avenue on April 27, 1910, construction is well under way. A large stack of bricks is piled in the street and the building is surrounded by other construction materials. Construction workers appear to have lined up on top of the building to pose for this photograph. Lenox Hall accommodated thirty-seven students and offered all the advantages of a country home to its pupils while enjoying the many opportunities for culture of a school in a large city. The aim of Thomas was to establish a relation of friendship between teacher and pupil, as well as to develop ideals which will be of lasting influence in building up a cultured and refined womanhood. In large institutions general classifications and uniform demands are imperative, but in the small private school it was possible for each pupil to have such individual attention that her instruction was adapted to her especial needs, and her mental and physical growth stimulated and encouraged by a healthful and normal process. It was impossible to cast all minds in one mold, to measure all by one standard. Each individual was a separate entity with individual insufficiencies and needs, and ought to have training suited to such needs, also the attention that awakens dormant talent and the power of right thinking which determines right living. Lenox Hall was affiliated with University of Missouri‚ÄìSt. Louis, Washington University in St. Louis, Wellesley College, Smith College, and other colleges of the East and South admitting women. Much individual work was done teaching students to analyze, systematize, and correlate their work; suggestive talks were given on the value of concentration, accurate and independent thinking, sustained attention, etc. The course of study prescribed by Thomas was elastic and the methods of teaching vary each year according to age, development, tastes and interest of the pupils. She believed that \\"what we teach has higher ends than merely being taught and learned,\\" and held that the supreme end of education was the formation of character, therefore all subjects were dealt with vitally and with relation to the life of the individual pupil, whose sense of responsibility was thus awakened and gradually developed so that the foundation was laid upon which to build a future, well-ordered, satisfying life. Thomas laid much stress upon the moral as well as the religious training of the girls under her care. Right thinking as well as right living was the basic principle of character building. Truth, \\"from within, out,\\" sincerity, lofty ideals, and unselfish sympathy with one's fellow beings is the spirit she tried to inculcate. Realizing the importance of definite training of the social instincts and the necessity of affording maturing womanhood an opportunity to exercise the natural tendencies of her social being, Thomas endorsed various forms of entertainment by which the young girl may learn the grace and charm which characterizes \\"gentle womanhood,\\" and which gave every opportunity for enjoyment, instruction and means of acquiring ease and grace of manner in conversation. She believed that social training was essential in the development of poise, and in the cultivation of the faculty of being interested in things‚Äîthe best things. It was the means whereby the facts of scholarships were translated into terms of life and the individual developed into an active, efficient social unit. Just as growth was secured by cultivation so was development made sure by expression. Social training was the means for the expression of education; it was the opportunity for \\"applied culture,\\" and was as essential a factor in the development of an effective personality as was the storing up of facts which in themselves made but a \\"dead scholarship.\\" Thomas also advocated the study of languages as being a decided advantage to every woman. The editor of The World's Work issued a Hand Book of Schools in 1912 as a guide to parents considering the school question. Thomas was requested to contribute one of the two articles allotted to schools for girls only; the others being written by such men as professors of Columbia University, editors of magazines, presidents of well-known schools, etc. She contributed frequently to magazines and periodicals, both prose and poetry, and one of the poems which she sent out as a New Year's greeting to the patrons of the school was adopted by the president of the Mothers' Congress of Texas to send to members of the different branches throughout the State as her greeting for 1913, being printed very neatly in booklet form. It was the custom of the principal of Lenox Hall to entertain, at intervals, house guests of distinction and recognized culture, giving the pupils the opportunity of coming into close personal touch with men and women whose wealth of experience and achievement was an inspiration. Many of the principal educators of Eastern colleges, as well as authors of note, enjoyed this courtesy‚Äîamong them James Monroe Taylor, 4th president of Vassar College; Ruth McEnery Stuart; Bertha Kunz-Baker; Florence Howe-Hall, daughter of Julia Ward Howe; Belva A. Lockwood; Samantha A. Huntley; Alfred D'Orsay Tennyson Dickens. As an educator Mrs. Louise Thomas ranked among the best. She was highly cultured, and was gracious and charming in manner. Her strong personality endeared her to all of her pupils. In 1888, M. Louise Thomas served as a founding member and officer of the National and International Council for Women alongside Susan B. Anthony. Personal life M. Louise Thomas M. Louise Russell married J.D. Thomas and had three children: Russell A. Thomas (died in 1895), Raydell T. Watson (1891-1974) and Louise Le Noir Thomas. Louise Le Noir Thomas followed her mother example as an advocate of women's suffrage and a member of the Equal Suffrage League of St. Louis. She attended Smith College and engaged in a variety of athletic pursuit. After college she became a writer and worked in advertising and advocated for women's self-defense as an extension of the quest for political equality. M. Louise Thomas died in 1947, and is buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery, Saint Louis. NOTE: This article partially conflates M. Louise Russell Thomas with Maria Louise Palmer Thomas (1825-1907),who was born in Mount Holly, New Jersey, raised in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, and who married Universalist minister Abel C. Thomas. This Louise was an intimate friend of Abraham Lincoln, Edwin M. Stanton, P.T. Barnum, and Susan B. Anthony. In 1867, the Thomases purchased the 20-acre estate of Thomas Lloyd Wharton in the Tacony neighborhood of Philadelphia, PA. Among achievements too numerous to mention here (see Tacony: Era of William H. Gatzmer and the Philadelphia & Trenton Railroad (2015) by Charles A. McCloskey), Louise founded a Tacony chapter of the women's organization, Sorosis, conceived of the idea for a library for the growing community of Tacony (which endures today as the Tacony branch of the Free Library of Philadelphia), and served as secretary of the National Council of Women while Susan B. Anthony was vice- president. The photo appearing to the right, here, is of this M. Louise Thomas, not \\"Minnie.\\" References 1861 births 1947 deaths Burials at Bellefontaine Cemetery People from Columbia, Missouri People from St. Louis Educators from Missouri ","title":"M.

History  While tulips were known from at least the 12th century in Persia, and appear in decorative art in Turkey in the 13th century, the first description in European botanical literature, was by Conrad Gesner in his De Hortus Germanica (1561), which he referred to as Tulipa turcarum, and states he saw in a garden in Augsburg in 1559.  Phylogeny  The taxonomy of Tulipa has always been complex and difficult for many reasons. Tulipa is a genus of the Liliaceae (lily) family, once one of the largest family of monocots, but which molecular phylogenetics has shown to be a much smaller discrete family with only 15 genera. Within Liliaceae, Tulipa is placed within Lilioideae, one of three subfamilies, with two tribes. Tribe Lilieae includes seven other genera in addition to Tulipa. Some species with a more eastern distribution (China, Korea, Japan) formerly classified as Tulipa are now considered as the separate genus Amana, including Amana edulis (Tulipa edulis). These species are more closely allied to Erythronium, although some authors believe that all three genera of the Tulipeae could be treated as a single genus. The evolutionary and phylogenetic relationships between the genera currently included in Liliaceae are shown in this Cladogram.  Subdivision  Subgenera and sections Historically, subdivision of the genus and speciation (separation of species) has been based on vegetative and floral characters, but further research has shown these to be quite plastic, even within a species. Together with population variability, hybridisation and naturalisation, the classification and taxonomy of tulips has been complex and controversial. The genus Tulipa was traditionally divided into two sections, Eriostemones and Tulipa (as Leiostemones), and comprises about 76 species. In 1997, the two sections were raised to subgenera and subgenus Tulipa was divided into five sections: * Clusianae * Eichleres ** subdivided into eight series * Kopalkowskiana * Tulipanum * Tulipa Subgenus Eriostemones was divided into the sections: * Biflores * Sylvestres * Saxatiles In 2009, two other subgenera were proposed, Clusianae and Orithyia, and this total of four subgenera was corroborated by a 2013 study by Maarten Christenhusz and colleagues. That study did not find support for any of the previous sections proposed, and since hybridisation is relatively common, it is probably better to refrain from subdividing the subgenera any further. Species Historically there has been considerable disagreement about the number of species within the genus. For instance tulips often grow in remote inaccessible hills and valleys where winters are harsh and summers long and dry, and may flower for only a short period, meaning that species are often missed. Furthermore, descriptions of species were often derived from studying cultivated bulbs, and the variability of the wild population was poorly understood. Many of these species were never identified in the wild. These taxonomic difficulties are those associated with long established cultivation, hybridisation, selection and naturalisation. Treatments of the genus vary considerably in how they deal with speciation, with some, such as the Flora Europaea (1980), taking a very broad approach, and others a much more narrow approach. For example, a broad approach treats T. orphanidea as a single variable species with a range of forms, while those using a narrow approach divide the species into T. bithynica, T. hageri and T. whittallii. The number of accepted species has varied between 50 and 114, for instance The Plant List (2013) includes 113. A 2013 review lists 76, as described here.

Etymology The word tulip, first mentioned in western Europe in or around 1554 and seemingly derived from the \\"Turkish Letters\\" of diplomat Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, first appeared in English as tulipa or tulipant, entering the language by way of and its obsolete form tulipan or by way of Modern Latin tulƒ´pa, from Ottoman Turkish t√ºlbend (\\"muslin\\" or \\"gauze\\"), and may be ultimately derived from the delband (\\"Turban\\"), this name being applied because of a perceived resemblance of the shape of a tulip flower to that of a turban. This may have been due to a translation error in early times, when it was fashionable in the Ottoman Empire to wear tulips on turbans. The translator possibly confused the flower for the turban.

They were one of four classes, together with the BB 12000, CC 14000 and CC 14100 classes, that formed an experimental group for studying the practicality of the new French electrification.  25 kV 50 Hz electrification  The standard French electrification system before WWII was 1,500 V DC, beginning with locomotives such as the 2BB2 400. Post-WWII, France occupied the south-west of Germany and the H√∂llentalbahn. This line had been electrified with one of the first systems to use 50 Hz, the standard commercial distribution frequency, rather than the lower Hz AC frequency previously required for railway traction motors in Europe. The H√∂llentalbahn used a voltage of 20 kV. There was much interest post-war in using the 'industrial' frequency of 50 Hz and supplying the railways from the now established national systems of electricity generation, rather than requiring an isolated supply network for railways alone. The first French 50 Hz AC line, the , was in the :Haute- Savoie, using a small quantity of experimental motive power. It began at 20 kV in 1951, as for the H√∂llentalbahn, but in 1953 the voltage was raised to 25 kV. As this was successful, a second 25 kV electrification of 'la Transversale Nord-Est', the between Thionville and Valenciennes, was tried. This carried three express trains and a hundred freight trains each day, with gradients of up to 1:90. It was significantly a mineral line, bringing coal from the mines of the North to the ironworks of the Lorraine. To investigate the best system for taking the industrial frequency line current and delivering it to the traction motors, four similar classes of locomotive were constructed, each using a separate technique. One class, the BB 12000, was to be geared fast enough for express passenger services at , the others for mixed-traffic or freight. In 1952 orders for 85 locomotives were placed: five BB 12000, fifteen BB 13000, twenty CC 14000, sixty five CC 14100\\\\.  Design  The four classes each took a different approach to the use of the AC supply current. The first, the BB 12000, used DC traction motors with ignitron rectifiers; the BB 13000 used new 50 Hz AC traction motors; the CC 14000 used DC traction motors with rectification by rotary converters and the CC 14100 used three-phase AC traction motors, again with rotary converters. The first two classes were of B‚Ä≤B‚Ä≤ layout with two four wheel bogies and a separate traction motor for each axle. As the axles were mechanically coupled by gearing though, they were classified as B‚Ä≤B‚Ä≤ rather than Bo‚Ä≤Bo‚Ä≤. Owing to the greater weight of the rotary converters, the 14000 and 14100 had a Co‚Ä≤Co‚Ä≤ layout with extra axles to carry their weight without increasing the axle load. The BB 13000 system was designed by Jeumont-Schneider. The 25 kV line current was regulated by an autotransformer then transformed by the main transformer to 750 V AC. This secondary current drives the four single-phase traction motors (one per axle) connected in parallel. Motor speed was controlled by resistor and capacitor shunts at low speeds, resistor and inductor shunts at high speeds. This AC motor system did not have the advantages of the traction control of the BB 12000 series and their DC motors with precise control from the ignitron phase control. It was found that although the AC motor system was initially simpler to build as it did not need rectifiers, it was not so well-suited to low speed and accelerating from frequent stops, and so ito was generally restricted to longer non-stop mainline services. Once silicon rectifiers became available to replace the ignitrons, as had been used on the last of the BB 12000, this became the dominant way to build all AC electric locomotives for decades. The bogie designs were taken from the , but shortened and simplified as the locomotives were of lower speed. This bogie used two separate traction motors with cardan shaft connection to the wheels, rather than the previous French 'dancing ring' design. As these bogies mechanically coupled the two motors, they are classed as a B‚Ä≤B‚Ä≤ arrangement, rather than Bo‚Ä≤Bo‚Ä≤. The body style was a steeplecab with a single 'monocabine' central control cab and long, low bonnets at each end. The single cab design was chosen because previous experience had suggested that providing duplicated control gear at the ends of the locomotive was the least reliable part of an electric locomotive, and this way only one set might be needed, with direct access to it. However this simplicity also prevented the locomotives being connected in multiple. The driver was also better protected in case of accident. The two diamond pantographs required more space than the cab roof and so were supported on two distinctive cantilevered platforms, ahead and behind the cab. The steeplecab and its overhanging pantograph platforms gave them the nickname of 'flatirons'. Some drivers also knew them as 'trancheur de jambon' from the control wheel's resemblance to that of a bacon slicer.  Service history  Luxembourg in 1987 Both the BB 12000 and BB 13000 classes had cramped cabins and relatively poor braking. The BB 12000 were clearly electrically superior though. The BB 13000 class began to be withdrawn in the 1980s and the last operated in January 1994.

He is best known for sailing alongside Jean-Baptiste du Casse as well as for his Articles, or ‚ÄúPirate Code.‚Äù History Dutch pirate Laurens de Graaf in 1687 captured a 14-gun Spanish frigate near Cartagena which he renamed Sainte Rose. He sailed to Petit-Goave where the officials confirmed the capture ‚Äì de Graaf claimed the Spaniard had attacked him first - and granted de Graaf possession of the ship. The Governor of Port-de-Paix asked him to retire to Ile a Vache to serve as Major. He agreed and arranged for his crew to disperse. The Governor suspected trouble and sailed to Ile a Vache to investigate, finding less than half of de Graaf's crew still present and the Sainte Rose missing. de Graaf explained that he'd set the ship to sea to rescue an English vessel which had foundered nearby, and to intercept a privateer spotted in the area. French language original, as reprinted in Le Diable Volant : Une histoire de la flibuste : de la mer des Antilles √† l'oc√©an Indien (1688-1700) / ('The Flying Devil : A History of the Filibusters : From the Antilles to the Indian Ocean (1688-1700)'). In truth de Graaf had given the Sainte Rose to a friend and former crewmate, Jean Charpin. By the time the Governor left satisfied with de Graaf's explanation, Charpin had drawn up Articles to govern the crew's piracy and had all aboard sign them. His Pirate Code is one of the few surviving sets and one of the only ones complete. Translated from the French, they read: In early 1688 Charpin collected additional crew before setting out. At the island of Roatan he took on board Jean FantinOne source (Vallar) says Fantin and Charpin were the same person; Gasser et al. do not agree. and some sailors from Dutch buccaneer Jan Willem‚Äôs former crew. He also embarked William Kidd and Robert Culliford, whom he picked up at Ile a Vache, two of only 6 Englishmen among over 70 French sailors. Under a privateering commission they captured a Dutch ship in early 1689, which they renamed Dauphin and carried back to New England where they sold their plundered cargo and refitted for a longer voyage. While there, the crew took a vote and removed Charpin as commander, selecting Fantin in his place. Charpin remained aboard the Sainte Rose as Fantin sailed to west Africa, joining forces with Jean-Baptiste du Casse at Cape Verde and then returning to the Caribbean. Charpin complained to du Casse about the loss of his ship, but his pleas were ignored. Fantin captured a rich Spanish ship at du Casse's request, then joined him ashore in unsuccessful attacks on Dutch colonies at Surinam and Berbice. Charpin argued about division of the loot from the Spanish ship, and his former crew abandoned him to sail aboard it with Fantin. When England and France declared war later in 1689, du Casse assaulted the English settlement at St. Christopher. It was there that Kidd and Culliford conspired with the English crewmen to steal the unguarded Spanish prize ship from Fantin, sailing it to Nevis where they renamed it Blessed William. Fantin left with Charpin's remaining crew aboard a captured brigantine. Little more is known of Charpin; he may have departed with the soldiers du Casse dismissed after the attack on St. Christopher, whom he sent away on the Dauphin. The Sainte Rose itself ended up beached during one of du Casse's attacks. Charpin's quartermaster Desmarestz bought a small ship named La Machine and continued on to a piracy career of his own.

Approximately 300,000 individuals in the United States have their appendix removed each year. Extirpation of the colon, or colectomy, is used in the treatment of patient's ulcerative colitis whose condition is resistant to other therapies. In many cases, the removal of the colon may entirely cure the disease. A colectomy may also be utilized in the treatment of colon cancer. Extirpation of the gallbladder, known as a cholecystectomy, may be used as a treatment for recurrent gallstones or cholecystitis. This type of procedure is typically elective and outcomes following the procedure are typically good. The rate of cholecystectomies being performed on patients with cholecystitis has increased markedly since the first laparoscopic procedure was performed in 1985; jumping from 2.2% in 1996 to 31.4% in 2008.

Early life George Julian Zolnay with sculpture students at Art Academy of People's University. Nancy Coonsman is kneeling on the far right. Nancy Coonsman was born in St. Louis, Missouri, on August 28, 1887, the daughter of Robert A. Coonsman (b. 1851) and Henrietta \\"Nettie\\" Hynson (b. 1854). After passing through the public schools her mother influenced her to develop the talent which she early displayed, and which she herself possessed in a marked degree when young, but had never had the opportunity of developing. Rodney Coonsman, her brother, was interested in the financial sheet of a local newspaper, and his wife was an artist of considerable reputation. She graduated from the Central High School in 1906. Coonsman took a four-year course in the St. Louis School of Fine Arts of University of Missouri‚ÄìSt. Louis and then studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts with Charles Grafly. In 1911 she was an honor student working with George Julian Zolnay. This privilege was only accorded those who showed unusual talent. Coonsman studied in New York City under Abastenia St. Leger Eberle. Career Frogs and Girls, International studio (1897) Nancy Coonsman exhibited in the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, New York Academy of Design and Western Artists' Exhibition. For her lighter work, fountains, both for interior decorations and the garden, had always held her attention. Coonsman placed a fountain in the Mullanphy Floral Shop, a center fountain with graceful cherubs, and made another of quite pretentious design for Randolph Laughlin's new home, \\"Lachlin,\\" in St. Louis County. A little St. Louis girl posed for this. There were two figures, and hers was kneeling down on flat stones catching the water in a lily leaf, which she held in her hand, as it trickled through the rock. Another ambition was to do large agricultural figures in a big conventional way, but in St. Louis the need or call for such work did not come up often. Coonsman also worked as a teacher, as assistant in the Art School, private classes, and regularly at Bishop Robertson Hall. She did a portrait of Ruth Felker. It was dignified and true to life. Another sketch of Eloise Wells was a charming piece of workmanship, as well as of Elsie Blackman and Georgia Cady. Coonsman was selected over a number of competitors to execute sculpture for a fountain for the Kincaid Memorial to be located in the sunken garden behind the Public School Library. Margaret Kincaid of Louisiana, Missouri, had donated funds for a drinking fountain, specifying that the competition had to be open only to women. Coonsman also designed the two concrete benches nearby which are supported by elves. Nancy Coonsman and the Missouri War Memorial In 1922, Nancy Coonsman won a $25,000 ($348,890.17 in 2017) competition to design the war memorial, called Victory, erected in Cheppy-Varennes-en-Argonne, France, to honor the Missouri soldiers from the 35th Infantry Division (United States) killed during World War I. In 1926 she designed The Doughboy, dedicated in 1928, to honor World War I soldiers and placed in Overton Park (or Veterans Park) in Memphis, Tennessee. Later in life she became a teacher and worked on small figures and busts. Personal life Nancy Coonsman, 1 August 1912, St Louis Post-Dispatch Nancy Coonsman married Emanual (Mannel) Hahn (b. 1885) in 1918 and they had one son, Charless Hahn (February 13, 1919 ‚Äì March 17, 1999), a stamp dealer and collector who wrote a column on philately for the Chicago Sun Times.Charless Hahn. Hahn was the founder, and consequently first president, of the Burlington Liars' Club. While living in Burlington, Nancy Coonsman sculpted the brass plaque erected by the Burlington Historical Society on Highway 11, west of White River bridge, to commemorate the site of the Voree Mormon settlement.

It is a low-impact AMPAR PAM. Tulrampator (S-47445, CX-1632), a newer and high-impact AMPAR PAM. AMPA receptor positive allosteric modulators are positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the receptor (AMPR), a type of ionotropic glutamate receptor which mediates most fast synaptic neurotransmission in the central nervous system. Medical applications AMPAR PAMs have cognition- and memory-enhancing and antidepressant-like effects in preclinical models, and have potential medical applications in the treatment of cognitive impairment (e.g., cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia, mild cognitive impairment), dementia (e.g., Alzheimer's disease), depression, and for other indications. They can broadly be divided into low-impact and high-impact potentiators, with high-impact potentiators able to produce comparatively more robust increases in AMPAR activation. However, high-impact AMPAR PAMs can cause motor coordination disruptions, convulsions, and neurotoxicity at sufficiently high doses, similarly to orthosteric AMPAR activators (i.e., active/glutamate site agonists). The AMPAR is one of the most highly expressed receptors in the brain, and is responsible for the majority of fast excitatory amino acid neurotransmission in the central nervous system (CNS). Considering the broad impact of the AMPARs in the CNS, selectively targeting AMPARs involved in disease is difficult, and it is thought that global enhancement of AMPARs may be associated with an intolerable level of toxicity. For this reason, doubt has been cast on the feasibility of AMPAR activators for use in medicine. However, low doses of AMPAR activators may nonetheless be useful, and AMPAR PAMs, which, unlike agonists, show selectivity for AMPAR subpopulations of different subunit compositions, may hold greater potential for medical applications. Pharmacology AMPAR PAMs bind to one or more allosteric sites on the AMPAR complex and potentiate the receptor. Unlike orthosteric (active/glutamate) site AMPAR activators, otherwise known as AMPAR agonists, AMPAR PAMs only potentiate AMPAR signaling in the presence of glutamate and hence do not activate the receptor directly/themselves. Moreover, whereas AMPAR agonists activate all AMPARs, AMPAR PAMs can show selectivity for specific subpopulations of AMPARs. This is because the AMPAR is composed of different combinations of various subunits, and the allosteric sites differ depending on the different subunit combinations. AMPAR PAMs can be broadly grouped into two types based on their binding site and impact on AMPAR activation: low-impact (type I) and high-impact (type II). Low-impact AMPAR PAMs have the following criteria: * Have little or no effect on the half-width of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP); and * Do not substantially bind to the cyclothiazide site on the AMPAR complex; and * Do not induce the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) While high-impact AMPAR PAMs have the following criteria: * Substantially alter/increase the half-width of the fEPSP; and/or * Substantially bind to the cyclothiazide site on the AMPAR complex; and * Induce the expression of BDNF Low-impact AMPAR PAMs decrease AMPAR deactivation (channel closing) alone to augment synaptic currents while high-impact AMPAR PAMs decrease both deactivation and desensitization together to enhance and prolong synaptic currents. Low-impact AMPAR PAMs have only slight effects on AMPAR currents, whereas high-impact AMPAR PAMs have effects more similar to those of AMPAR agonists and can produce strong enhancement. Similarly to AMPAR agonists, high-impact AMPAR PAMs can cause convulsions and neurotoxicity in sufficiently high doses. Conversely, low-impact AMPAR PAMs have few adverse effects. Classes and list of drugs By chemical structure There are several major chemical classes of AMPAR PAMs: * Benzamide and related compounds (also known as ampakines or CX compounds; mostly benzoylpyrrolidines) ‚Äì 1-BCP (BA-14), CX-516 (Ampalex, BDP-12, BA-74, ORG-24292, SPD-420), CX-546, CX-554 (BDP-20), CX-614, farampator (CX-691, ORG-24481, SCH-900460), CX-717, CX-929, CX-1501, tulrampator (S-47445, CX-1632), CX-1739, CX-1796, CX-1837, CX-1942, CX-2007, CX-2076, ORG-26576, S-70340 * Benzothiadiazides ‚Äì BIIR-777, cyclothiazide, diazoxide, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), IDRA-21, S-18986 * Biarylpropylsulfonamides and related compounds ‚Äì LY-392098, LY-404187, LY-450108, mibampator (LY-451395), LY-4516146, LY-503430, PEPA, PF-04778574, PF-04958242, CMPDA, CMPDB, (R,R)-PIMSD * Racetam and related compounds (very weak) ‚Äì aniracetam, piracetam, various others * Others: PF-04701475, PF-04958242, GVS-111 These classes have divergent properties, including allosteric site specificity, potency, impact (i.e., low versus high), and selectivity for AMPAR populations composed of different subunits. All of the biarylpropylsulfonamides are high-impact AMPAR PAMs, whereas the majority of the ampakines are low-impact AMPAR potentiators. The biarylpropylsulfonamides are highly potent, on the order of 1,000-fold more potent than the ampakines and cyclothiazide. By impact AMPAR PAMs can be broadly grouped by their impact on AMPAR activation: * Low-impact (type I): aniracetam, CX-516 (Ampalex, BDP-12, BA-74, ORG-24292, SPD-420), CX-614, CX-717, CX-929, CX-1739, farampator (CX-691, ORG-24481, SCH-900460), ORG-24448, piracetam * High-impact (type II): CX-701, CX-1837, CX-1846, LY-404187, LY-451646, mibampator (LY-451395), ORG-26576, PF-4778574, PF-04958242, tulrampator (S-47445, CX-1632)  See also  * GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator * NMDA receptor antagonist * List of investigational antidepressants  References  AMPA receptor positive allosteric modulators ","title":"AMPA receptor positive allosteric modulator"},{"id":"55112502","text":"Cycas saxatilis is a species of cycad found only on Saint Paul's Mountain, Palawan, Philippines.

The two follow Pallomari to Gilberto's location in Cali and alert Pe√±a. The police raid the house the next day and capture Gilberto when he tries to hide, avoiding the corrupt police in the process. With Gilberto in prison, his brother Miguel Rodr√≠guez Orejuela becomes the leader of the cartel, and has Pallomari and his family hide in a safehouse. Pe√±a investigates the cartel's money laundering operations, which is led by Franklin Jurado, a Colombian banker. Pe√±a meets with Jurado's American wife Christina but fails to get her cooperation in arresting Jurado. He tails Jurado in Cura√ßao and arrests him with help from the Dutch Caribbean Police Force, but Jurado refuses to testify until he sees his wife. Christina is kidnapped and held hostage by the FARC guerillas, but Pe√±a rescues her with the help of Don Berna and the right-wing Casta√±o brothers. Fearing that Jurado will testify against them, the Cali Cartel has him killed in prison. The Cali Cartel begins to slowly weaken with pressure from the Colombian police, the DEA and the North Valley Cartel. Jorge Salcedo, a rather reluctant member of the Cali Cartel, becomes an informant for the DEA. During the Cali Fair, the North Valley Cartel attacks Miguel at a salsa party and Pacho Herrera in Mexico; the two escape unharmed. Impressed by Salcedo's actions that helped save his life, Miguel promotes Salcedo as his head of security, replacing his son David Rodriguez, not knowing that Salcedo is secretly working alongside the DEA. Salcedo tips Van Ness and Feistl of Miguel's location, but Pe√±a insists that the operation is done entirely legally. After a lengthy search, Van Ness and Feistl discover open air space in the wall that they highly suspect Miguel is hiding in and they start to bash down the wall, but they are stopped when the head of the Cali Attorney General's office walks in and declares their actions illegal. After the close call on Miguel, David becomes increasingly suspicious of Salcedo and Enrique, Salcedo's right-hand man. Miguel and David torture Enrique who confesses that Salcedo is an informant. David and Miguel are about to kill Salcedo when an American pager planted by Salcedo goes off in Enrique's pocket. Convinced he is the rat, Miguel has Enrique killed, but David remains highly suspicious of Salcedo, and continues to dig for evidence on Salcedo's disloyalty. Salcedo tips off the DEA again on Miguel's new location, and tells them he will convince Miguel to move to a safer location and advises the arrest happen during the transport. Before Miguel can leave the house, David finds video proof of Salcedo walking into Van Ness and Feistl's apartment and alerts his father. Salcedo is almost killed by Miguel but he flees before the raid team can capture him. Miguel is arrested when he tries to flee his house. With the Rodriguez brothers gone, Pacho kills the North Valley leaders and surrenders to the police with Chepe. David sends the sicario Navegante to kill Pallomari, but is killed by Salcedo and the DEA. Pallomari agrees to testify in exchange for immunity for himself and his family. Both Salcedo and Pallomari testify against the cartel, and disappear in the witness protection program. David is killed by the North Valley Cartel after failing to kill Salcedo's family. In court, Pallomari reveals the Cali Cartel has illegally funded the presidential campaign of Ernesto Samper and have bribed multiple politicians. While a political scandal ensues, the Rodriguez brothers are extradited to the United States and receive lengthy sentences. Pacho is killed in prison by the North Valley and Chepe is murdered by the AUC leaders when he fails to ally himself with them. With the last of the Colombian cartels gone, Pe√±a realizes the drug trade has moved to Mexico, where the trade is played differently. The final episode ends with him and his father Chucho by the Rio Grande, where they watch an armed group smuggle drugs on a boat.

It was direct by Uruguayan Walter Tournier, based on a script he wrote in collaboration with Mario Jacob and Enrique Cort√©s and premiered on Feb. 2, 2012.Selkirk, el verdadero Robinson Crusoe (2011). Ficha completa It was filmed mainly with stop motion, with digital details added in post-production.  Background  The story behind the film is based on an actual case in 1703, when Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk argued with the captain of his ship and was abandoned for more than four years on a deserted island. That case, and perhaps another similar one carried out by Pedro Serrano, were sources for English writer Daniel Defoes' novel Robinson Crusoe.  Plot  Selkirk, a rebellious and egotistical pirate, is the pilot of the Esperanza, an English galleon that sails the southern seas looking for treasure. Through gambling he earns the present and future savings of his companions, winning the enmity of the crew and Captain Bullock, who decides to leave him on a desert island.  Reception  The critic Diego Batlle said that to the rhythm of a catchy candombe music and with a colorful visual design (even if the finish is far from Hollywood perfection) this film produced in Uruguay in an artisan form -frame by frame- delivers good doses of humor And ingenuity in developing the misadventures of the pathetic crew of the Esperanza galleon, and especially the anti-hero who will be stranded on a tropical island. Although the film welcomes the morals expected in every politically correct children's film (the egoism, greed and individualism of the protagonist will be transformed, with experience, into feelings much more noble), does not fall into the didactic and the obvious descent of line. It is worthwhile that a certain sector of the public accustomed to the frenetic pace and the spectacularity of the images of the animated productions of the North American cinema see this more than worthy Uruguayan proposal although it costs him a little accustomed to its tone, rhythm and style, because it will be a good Exercise that the children of today discover that there is another type of narrations as valuable and equally recommendable as those of the vertiginous digital images and effects in 3D.Una pel√≠cula artesanal para que los chicos descubran una narraci√≥n distinta y valiosa by Diego Batlle, published in La Naci√≥n del 2-2-2012, Accessed 5-2-2012 For the critic of La Voz del Interior, this feature reminded him of the celebrated television program Caloi. The director has directed numerous shorts, one of which was chosen as a prominent film of the twentieth century by the Festival of Annecy, France, one of the most famous of the genre and one of the sources where he drank the cycle of the Black Caloi, the creator Of Clement. Using figures that could have been made with plasticine, Tournier recreates delicious details ranging from the metal of beer pints, to wooden buckets from where pirates serve rationed water when they are on the high seas, recreation of the village, Tavern, galleon and Selkirk survival techniques, such as cooking turtle eggs for lunch, using a clam as a frying pan.

In this map based storytelling board game, players seek fame and fortune and the eventual discovery of a mysterious last ruin. The gameplay blends resource management with a storybook, with players controlling heroes that equip and provision themselves in a town, and then set out to explore the map, setting up camps and completing quests. The game is a sequel to Laukat's Above and Below, which is set in the same fictional universe (Arzium). The game can be played as an ongoing, 10 game campaign, with each session being played on a different map. The game was originally sold via a Kickstarter campaign in July 2016, raising over $520,000 from over 7,000 backers.  Gameplay  Players begin in a town, hiring allies and obtaining supplies such as coins, gems, and food from different buildings. They can then explore the world by using one of 11 different maps. The game comes with an atlas of spiral bound world maps, with each flip of the page revealing a different map that can be the board for a particular game. Players will set up camps on the map, gain resources, defeat threats, and explore story locations through the use of a separate storybook. When a player reaches an adventure location, another player will read the story, which ends by giving the player two choices, and a skill check which must be passed to give rewards. Players win by scoring the most points, many of which come from artifacts, which require certain resources to build. There are four play modes to the game. There is a tutorial scenario, an arcade mode which eliminates the stories from play, a character mode which has different stories for eight unique characters attempting to find a lost ruin which holds an artifact that will fulfill their heart's desire, and a full campaign mode with far reaching story elements which uses 10 of the game's maps in different play sessions.  Reception  Popular Mechanics, Inverse, and Stuff each cited Near and Far as one of the best board games of 2017, with Matt Thrower of Stuff describing it as \\"a rare game that can satisfy the desire for both story and strategy at once.\\"  Expansion  In October 2017, Red Raven Games launched an expansion to the game, again via a Kickstarter campaign, titled Near and Far: Amber Mines. The campaign raised over $350,000 from just under 6,600 backers, with an anticipated delivery date of April 2018.

The memorial was designed by Alfred Preis, and has a sagging center but strong and vigorous ends, expressing \\"initial defeat and ultimate victory\\". It commemorates all lives lost on December 7, 1941. Glencoe Online website, retrieved on November 10, 2011. Although December 7 is known as National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day it is not a federal holiday in the United States. The nation does however pay homage remembering the thousands injured and killed when attacked by the Japanese in 1941 and on Pearl Harbor Day the American flag should be flown at half-staff until sunset. Schools and other establishments in many places around the country do observe lowering the American flag to half-staff out of respect. Ceremonies are held annually at Pearl Harbor itself, attended each year by some of the ever-dwindling number of elderly veterans who were there on the morning of the attack. 24SevenPost website, December 7, 2010. retrieved on November 10, 2011.

Prange is an extremely comprehensive account of the events leading up to the Pearl Harbor attack and is considered by most scholars to be the best single work about the raid. It is a balanced account that gives both the Japanese and American perspectives. Prange spent 37 years researching the book by studying documents about Pearl Harbor and interviewing surviving participants to attempt the most exhaustive account of what happened: the Japanese planning and execution, why U.S. intelligence failed to warn of it, and why a peace agreement was not attained. The book is the first in the so-called \\"Prange Trilogy\\" of Pearl Harbor books co-written with Donald Goldstein and Katherine Dillon, the other two being: ** Pearl Harbor: The Verdict of History ‚Äì a dissection of the various revisionist theories surrounding the attack. ** December 7, 1941: The Day The Japanese Attacked Pearl Harbor ‚Äì a recollection of the attack as narrated by eyewitnesses. * Day of Infamy by Walter Lord was one of the most popular nonfiction accounts of the attack on Pearl Harbor.Walter Lord, Day of Infamy (Henry Holt and Co., 1957.

In 1972, while at Stanford University, he pioneered the use of the bioptome and transvenous endomyocardial biopsy in the early diagnosis of heart transplant rejection. It was considered the most significant advance in antirejection therapy of the time. Awarded the British American Research Fellowship in 1971, Caves worked with pioneering cardiothoracic surgeon Norman Shumway at Stanford and became staff surgeon leading the transplant programme by 1973. A year later he went to Edinburgh as a senior lecturer in cardiac surgery, where he became particularly interested in pediatric cardiac surgery. By 1975, Caves had become a professor in the University of Glasgow honorary consultant surgeon and chair of cardiac surgery in Glasgow and with 'inexhaustible dynamism' involved in the organisation of cardiac surgery. His sudden death at the age of 38 years whilst playing squash was documented to have shocked many of his colleagues. The International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) bestows one of its highest awards in his name.  Early education  Caves was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland in 1940. He attended the Royal Belfast Academical Institution and then studied medicine at Queen's University Belfast, from which he graduated with a MB BCh in 1964.  Surgical career  Caves achieved the DObst RCOG in 1966 and the FRCS for Edinburgh in 1968. That year, he began his early surgical training with the cardiovascular and thoracic unit at Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, continuing at the Brompton Hospital, London in 1970 after taking the English FRCS in 1969. In 1971, the British and American Heart Associations awarded him and funded a research fellowship at Stanford University. After receiving the research fellowship to Stanford, Caves worked in the dog laboratory with Margaret Billingham, who was the histopathologist at Stanford. Here, he perfected the technique of percutaneous transvenous endomyocardial biopsy using the flexible Stanford- Caves Schulz bioptome which transformed the management of heart transplant patients and helped in a significant improvement in the results of heart transplantation. Werner Schulz was an instrument maker and key to the modification of the bioptome. Until that time the only way of trying to detect early rejection was by the daily monitoring of summated EKG voltages which tended to decline as rejection developed but at a relatively late stage. However, by being able to examine small biopsies taken from the interventricular septum of the heart it was possible to detect early histological changes of rejection and increase immunosuppressive treatment earlier and more effectively. Likewise, repeat biopsy after some days could define whether the rejection was resolving and reduce therapy sooner. The device, a modification of one produced by Konno in Japan, was inserted through the right internal jugular vein and guided into the right ventricle of the transplanted heart. A biopsy was then taken. This technique of allowing early detection of acute organ rejection and confirming absence of rejection eventually resulted in the establishment of a heart rejection grading system. Cyclosporin was given if the biopsy result indicated early rejection. By the 1980s this was considered the best method of detection. During his second year, Stanford's leading cardiothoracic surgeon, Norman Shumway had become impressed with what Caves had achieved and he promoted Caves to Chief Resident in 1972 and to Staff Surgeon in charge of the Transplant programme in 1973. Caves travelled to Edinburgh in 1974 to become senior lecturer in the Department of Clinical Surgery, where he was active in new techniques in coronary artery surgery in newborns and infants. He held the first chair of cardiac surgery at the University of Glasgow in 1975, and contributed to the development of the adult and paediatric cardiac surgical service for the west of Scotland. A close friend who visited Caves in Stanford and later pioneered the cardiac transplant programme in Cambridge, Sir Terence English, described Caves in an interview as giving priority to the development of the paediatric and adult cardiac services and having \\"great enthusiasm for the future of heart transplantation\\". Caves was a left-handed surgeon who worked with specially designed left-handed instruments. Shumway made sure that Caves took his left-handed tools with him on return to Scotland. His influence on attitudes at Glasgow's Children's Hospital in the 1970s has been described as \\"whirlwind\\" as he operated on newborns who were previously considered not fit for surgery. According to his cousin, at one stage, Caves was performing up to one hundred operations a month. Amongst colleagues, Caves is thought to have been the most likely surgeon to have started the UK's first heart transplant program had he lived. Caves was influential in the careers of future pioneering surgeons including John Wallwork, who joined Papworth Hospital's Heart transplant programme in 1981 and was experienced in the use of cyclosporin after heart transplant whilst a chief resident at Stanford, under Shumway. His lecturing skills were highly regarded and sought after.  Death and legacy  He died unexpectedly on 23 July 1978. Since 1983, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplant has awarded its highest award to a surgical trainee. $1,000 is awarded at the Caves Award session during the annual general meeting to the surgical trainee who gives the best oral presentation. Eligibility criteria include students / Residents / Fellows / Scientists in training who are first authors and presenters, must be current members of the Society and no having previously won the award. It was recorded at the 50th anniversary of the annals of thoracic surgery in 2015, that Caves' approach to early organ rejection \\"remains the gold standard for today\\".

High school  Lewis attended Woodruff High School in 1974 but did not play basketball because the Peoria public schools did not yet offer a varsity basketball for females. Despite this lack of opportunity within the school, she played basketball on the playgrounds of Peoria, usually playing with boys. However, her ability came to the attention of Jill Hutchinson, who was working on building a program at Illinois State University. Lewis was invited to enroll at ISU to further her basketball career.  College  While at ISU, Lewis help the Redbirds win four state championships. She set the record for most rebounds in a game (27) and in a season (345); records which are still school records as of 2017. Lewis earned a letter in each of her four years at Illinois state. In the 1976‚Äì77 season the team recorded a record of 20‚Äì6 which led to a national ranking, 11th in the AIAW. She was named a Kodak All- American in 1977 and listed as a finalist for the Wade Trophy (an award for the nation's top female athlete). Lewis's accomplishments led to her induction into the Missouri Valley Conference Hall of Fame in 2016. USA Basketball Pan Am Lewis was named to the USA Basketball team roster. She would play for the team in the 1975 USA Women's Pan American Team. The games were originally planned for Santiago, Chile, then Sao Paulo, Brazil and finally held in Mexico City, Mexico in October. The Pan Am team had failed to win the gold in 1967 and 1971. This year, the team would be more successful, compiling a 7‚Äì0 record, and winning the gold medal for the first time since 1963. Olympics Lewis was named to the USA national team selected to play in the 1976 Olympics the first ever Olympic competition for a women's basketball team. While the team lost to the dominant Soviet Union team, they beat Czechoslovakia to win the silver medal. Professional career Lewis left school before graduating, and turned professional. She joined a professional team in France and played there for two years, before returning to the states and playing for the Iowa Cornets, a team in the Women's Professional Basketball League, the first professional basketball league for women in the US.

Terminology The first research into cute aggression was led by Oriana Arag√≥n. The term \\"cute aggression\\" was published widely in 2013, after Rebecca Dyer and Arag√≥n presented their team's early research on the topic at the annual meeting of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology on January 18.Stephanie Pappas (2013) \\"'I Wanna Eat You Up!' Why We Go Crazy for Cute\\" LiveScience, 21 January 2013. Accessed 2 September 2013. In 2015, Arag√≥n and colleagues published their first academic paper on the subject, using the alternative term \\"playful aggression\\", defined as follows: > Playful aggression is in reference to the expressions that people show > sometimes when interacting with babies. Sometimes we say things and appear > to be more angry than happy, even though we are happy. For example some > people grit their teeth, clench their hands, pinch cheeks, or say things > like \\"I want to eat you up!\\" It would be difficult to ask about every > possible behavior of playful aggression, so we ask generally about things of > this kind‚Äîcalling them playful aggressions. The concept of playful aggression is also captured in several non-English terms.Amy Smith (2017) \\"Cute anger management\\" Lateral magazine, 9 August 2017. Accessed 2 September 2017. In Filipino, for example, the word gigil refers to \\"the gritting of teeth and the urge to pinch or squeeze something that is unbearably cute.\\" In Indonesian, the word 'gemas' refers to the built- up feeling you feel when seeing cute objects, which then leads up to the gritting teeth or the urge to pinch. Function Playful aggression is a type of \\"dimorphous\\" display, in which a positive experience elicits expressions usually associated with negative emotions. This behaviour occurs more commonly in individuals who experience dimorphous emotions across a range of situations, and may help to regulate emotions by balancing an overwhelmingly positive emotion with a negative response.  Hormones involved  Dopamine and serotonin pathways * Dopamine ‚Äì released when engaging with an object that you perceive as cute, also released during aggression (neuronal reward system) * Oxytocin ‚Äì neuronal hormone and neurotransmitter that controls empathy and forms bonds with others * Serotonin ‚Äì regulates mood, social behaviors, and digestion * Endorphins ‚Äì involved in pain tolerance, associated with fight or flight stress response * Corticotropin Releasing Hormone (CRH) ‚Äì stimulates the production of ACTH * Adrenocorticotropin Hormone (ACTH) ‚Äì production of cortisol * Cortisol ‚Äì controls blood sugar levels, regulates metabolism * Adrenaline ‚Äì neurotransmitter involved in stress response, controls heart rate and sweat secretion amounts * Noradrenaline ‚Äì comparable function to adrenaline, stress response hormone  Emotion regulation  When presented with a \\"cute\\" stimulus, the natural response is often positive, which is linked to activity within the hippocampus located in the medial temporal lobe of the brain. Dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin are all released during a pleasurable situation and are thus involved in neurological reward pathways. CTH, ACTH, cortisol, adrenaline, and noradrenaline are all involved in the aggressive side of the response. When exposed to a stimulus, the emotions experienced activate the amygdala in the brain, eventually activating the hypothalamus which will, in turn, release CTH which travels via the infundibulum in order to bind to receptors allowing for the release of ACTH into the bloodstream, which will bind to receptors in the adrenal glands, which will release cortisol, adrenaline, and noradrenaline as a stress response. This reward pathway pairs with the stress response because the body strives to achieve homeostatic levels of emotion in addition to other physiological balances. In order to prevent becoming overly consumed by an emotion, the body will release hormones that impose the opposite effect in order to allow keeping the emotions under control. Intense positive feelings often produce hybrid categorically positive and typical negative expressions. This is commonly witnessed in situations in which a person is so overwhelmed by happiness that they begin to tear up or even cry. Such regulation of emotion has been coined \\"dimorphous expression\\". The dimorphous expression model seeks to identify the validity of the phenomenon via a study involving a series of questions asked to subjects in conditions where they were not exposed to a cute stimulus and in conditions where they were exposed.  Natural tendencies  Human beings possess the natural tendency of care- taking. As a species, humans rely heavily upon parental care in order for their offspring to survive. Humans have very low reproductive rates relative to other species which amplifies the importance of parental care toward the survival of their very few offspring. These feelings tend to be on a continuous scale rather than a particular threshold value. The gradient is most intense with objects that we perceive to be more cute in comparison to objects that are not as cute, but still generate a response.

His work as an architect is largely in the Scots baronial style. Life He was born in December 1819 the son of Peter Matthews, a bank teller, living on Thistle Street in Aberdeen.Aberdeen Post Office Directory 1824 His mother was Margaret Ross, daughter of the architect William Ross who had built the Union Bridge in the centre of the city. In 1834 he was articled to the local architect, Archibald Simpson to train as an architect. Here he met Thomas MacKenzie (1814-1854) whom he later went into partnership with. In 1839 he took the radical step of moving to London to work under George Gilbert Scott where he honed his design and business skills. Returning to Aberdeen in 1844 Simpson offered him a partnership but he instead set up with his assistant to create MacKenzie & Matthews.http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=200044 In 1850 he was living at 16 Adelphi Court in AberdeenAberdeen Post Office Directory 1850 Following Mackenzie's death in 1854 Matthews practiced alone. His commissions ranged from banks and churches to the remodelling of several country houses and castles (most notably Cawdor) but following the Scottish Education Act of 1872 he was involved in the wave of necessary school building. In 1863 Matthews entered Aberdeen Town Council as a councillor, but stood down in 1871. In 1883 he was suddenly and unexpectedly called upon to take the role of Lord Provost, replacing Peter Esslemont. During his term of office he oversaw several city improvement schemes including the Mitchell Tower and new University Graduation Hall. In 1886 he was succeeded by Sir William Henderson. Matthews services to the city brought him an honorary doctorate (LLD) from the University of Aberdeen.http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=200044 In later life he purchased Springhill House on the edge of the city which he enlarged and altered to his own needs. He died at his town house, 15 Albyn Terrace, on 28 June 1898. He is buried with his family in St Nicholas' Churchyard in Aberdeen. Family He was married to Elizabeth Duncan, and their children included the zoologist James Duncan Matthews.

Bergdorf attracted further public attention following an article in the Daily Mail highlighting Facebook comments that she‚Äîa mixed race trans woman of white English and black Jamaican heritage‚Äîhad made about white people. These comments‚Äîwhich included the claim that all white people were guilty of \\"racial violence\\" and that the white race was \\"the most violent and oppressive force of nature on Earth\\"‚Äîgenerated accusations that she was racist against white people. In response to her comments, L'Or√©al fired her from its campaign and Facebook removed her posts from their website, regarding them as being in contravention to its rules against hate speech. Bergdorf said she also faced online harassment, much of it of a racist and transphobic nature. Other commentators argued that the Daily Mail had quoted her out of context, and that her wider point about white supremacy and white privilege in Western societies was valid and needed wider dissemination. Claiming this to be the case, the Illamasqua beauty brand employed her to front its campaign and her supporters followed her suggestion to promote a boycott of L'Or√©al. Background At the time of the controversy, Bergdorf was aged 29 and living in London. She grew up in Stanstead Abbotts, Hertfordshire, into a middle-class family. Mixed race, she was born the child of a white English mother and an Afro-Jamaican father. She described growing up as a \\"very effeminate boy\\" and attending an all-boys school before studying English at the University of Brighton. At this point, she started wearing makeup and heels; she later described herself as having been genderqueer in that period of her life. While in Brighton, she later noted, \\"I went completely nuts, it was like an internal bomb had gone off and I did everything at once: crazy hair, crazy clothes, reckless behaviour and sex. I was living my teens in my early twenties.\\" After university, Bergdorf worked for three years in fashion PR. At the age of 24, she decided to undergo transition treatment; her experience transitioning was the subject of an episode of London Live's television show Drag Queens of London. She described experiencing prejudice as a result of being transgender, stating that \\"I get abuse every day. I've had my dress lifted up, I've been groped, yelled at. I've heard people I thought were friends referring to me as 'shemale' or 'it'. I've been walking down the street and pushed into parked cars.\\" She claims she was raped during this period and the perpetrator was never apprehended, an event which inspired her to take a greater role in social activism; \\"It wasn't just standing up for rights that were my own... Islamophobia, antisemitism, anything I saw that I didn't think was right, I would protest or post\\". She subsequently posted about issues like racism and transphobia on social media outlets like Facebook on a regular basis. Around the same time that she was transitioning, she established a club night called Pussy Palace. She got involved in modelling, stating that she was inspired by the lack of representation of trans women of colour in the industry; \\"I definitely set out to empower girls like me\\". Her first modelling job was for a Lebanese couture company. In 2014, the London Evening Standard referred to her as \\"a cornerstone of London's trans scene.\\" She told the newspaper that she was \\"so vocal\\" on trans issues because she sees it as \\"the new frontier\\", an issue being brought into public consciousness through the work of trans women like Laverne Cox and Carmen Carrera. Controversy In August 2017, Bergdorf was announced as one of 27 models taking part in L'Or√©al UK's \\"True Match\\" campaign. This was the first time that the company's UK branch had employed an openly transgender model to front one of its campaigns. On her social media, she declared: \\"Thank you L‚ÄôOr√©al Paris for giving me this platform. I hope it reaches another little eight-year-old trans girl and makes her feel a little more hopeful and a little less scared about her future, than what was installed in me when I was her age.\\" On 31 August, the Daily Mail published an article highlighting comments that Bergdorf had made on a Facebook post, describing it as an \\"extraordinary rant\\". In this post‚Äîwritten in the wake of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville‚ÄîBergdorf had stated: \\"Honestly I don't have energy to talk about the racial violence of white people any more. Yes ALL white people\\". Her post was also quoted as saying that \\"Once white people begin to admit that their race is the most violent and oppressive force of nature on Earth... then we can talk.\\" The Daily Mail's revelation went viral, being picked up by international news agencies including The New York Times and Al Jazeera. Various people accused Bergdorf of being racist toward whites; others believed that she raised awareness about white privilege and societal racism. On 1 September, L'Or√©al sacked Bergdorf. They issued a statement that the company \\"supports diversity and tolerance towards all people irrespective of their race, background, gender and religion\\" and that Bergdorf's comments about white people were \\"at odds with those values\\". Facebook also removed Bergdorf's original post from their website for breaching their policies on hate speech. In the wake of the controversy, Bergdorf described receiving threats of assault, rape, and death. Many comments contained racist, homophobic, and transphobic sentiment; among the comments posted to her social media were statements like \\"fuck you, stupid dirty and smelly nigga\\". She later related that as a result of this backlash she did not leave her home for several days, describing it as the worst week of her life. Publicly replying to L'Or√©al's action, Bergdorf stated: \\"Just know that in tearing me down, you are proving everything that I said to be true\\". She accused the company of trying to \\"cash in\\" on consumers with darker skin tones using rhetoric about \\"equality and diversity\\" while at the same time refusing to work towards dismantling the original \\"source of... discrimination and division\\" in Western society. She called on people to boycott the brand, and her supporters tweeted the hashtag \\"boycottLOreal\\". In solidarity with Bergdorf, the BBC Radio 1 DJ Clara Amfo‚Äîwho was also part of L'Or√©al's campaign‚Äîstood down from it. Bergdorf added that The Daily Mail had taken her comments out of context, revealing that when she had originally made the statement \\"all white people are racist\\", she was referring to \\"the fact that western society as a whole is a system rooted in white supremacy - designed to benefit, prioritise and protect white people before anyone of any other race.\\" She also stated that she found it puzzling why many regarded her views as \\"out of touch or extreme\\". Public response Bergdorf appeared on Good Morning Britain, where she argued with Piers Morgan; he was affronted by her view that he could be considered racist or sexist. Following her dismissal, Bergdorf appeared on morning television show Good Morning Britain on 4 September. There, she argued with the host Piers Morgan, who disagreed with a number of her views. He claimed to be offended by Bergdorf's suggestion that he, as a white man, was racist or sexist. She followed this with an appearance on the television show Victoria Derbyshire. There, she stated that L'Or√©al should not have sacked her and that it was ironic that they dropped her while retaining Cheryl Cole on the same campaign given that the latter had been \\"actively convicted for punching a black woman\\", the nightclub toilet attendant Sophie Amogbokpa, in 2003. Cole's representative issued a statement declaring that her employer was \\"disappointed\\" at being introduced into the controversy, adding that Cole had been \\"unanimously acquitted\\" of having any racial motivations in the 2003 incident. Writing in an op ed for the i newspaper, India Willoughby stated that‚Äîalthough as a fellow trans woman she sympathised with Bergdorf in many ways‚Äîshe did not believe that simply being a member of a minority gave Bergdorf \\" to insult a large percentage of the population\\". Criticising Bergdorf for presenting herself as a martyr, Willoughby further chastised \\"the right-on brigade\\" for \\"predictably\\" presenting the model as the victim of the situation. Writing for The Irish Times, Laura Kennedy stated that while Bergdorf should be free to express \\"her no doubt well-intended but very divisive and bigoted opinion\\", L'Or√©al should have every right to end its association with her as a result of her statements. Kennedy expressed support for some of Bergdorf's views‚Äîsuch as the need for wider acknowledgment of colonialism‚Äîbut critiqued what she regarded as the \\"increasingly popular but very shaky postmodernist and intersectional theory\\" upon which Bergdorf's arguments relied. Kennedy noted that this form of identity politics classifies \\"whole swathes of varied individuals into groups\\" and negates the role of inner-group diversity, individuality, and agency; she believed that it encouraged individuals to make \\"sweeping judgements\\" about people by \\"categorising them as part of my group, or external to it.\\" In turn, she noted, it closely mirrors the logic used by white supremacists and identitarians. In an op-ed written for The Independent, Otamere Guobadia argued that the controversy surrounding Bergdorf's comments was \\"part of a long media tradition of painting anti-racism activists, and particularly black women, as irrational anti-white furies\\", comparing it to the controversy that erupted the previous month following Jason Osamede Okundaye's statement that \\"all white people are racist\\". Guobadia added that in sacking Bergdorf, L'Or√©al was \\"contributing to the silencing of anti-racism activists\\" by ramping up the consequences for those \\"speaking out against racism\\" towards people of colour. The commentator Yasmin Alibhai-Brown argued that there was a trend among the British right-wing to defend free speech for white men but not for individuals of other backgrounds. As evidence, she contrasted the way that Bergdorf's comment was received on social media with the way that the politician Jacob Rees-Mogg and conversion therapist Mike Davidson‚Äîboth white men‚Äîhad been publicly received after making controversial comments during that same month. Alibhai-Brown stated that in the UK, there was a situation whereby \\"freedom of speech is a now a right reserved for white toffs and homophobes, bigots and sexists, populists and supremacists. The rest of us must watch what we say, or else.\\" Left-wing commentator Owen Jones concurred; in an article in the Irish Times, he stated that \\"the right-wing 'free speech' brigade did not proclaim [Bergdorf] was entitled to her opinion\\" in the same way that it had done for Davidson and other right-wing men. Writing for the New Statesman, Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff stated that L'Or√©al was \\"so blinded by gaining profit\\" that it did not bother to conduct \\"research into the people\\" it employed \\"in the first place\\" and that had the company's staff read Bergdorf's social media posts before hiring her then they would be well aware of her views. In an interview for The Guardian, Bergdorf stated that L'Or√©al were aware that she was an activist when they hired her, and that \\"being an activist means calling people out, not just saying what everyone else is saying and what everyone else wants to think and upholding the common consensus.\\" She insisted that people should avoid dictionary definitions of \\"racism\\" because they were \\"written a very long time ago and not by a person of colour\\"; instead she said that people should use the word \\"racism\\" only for \\"a whole system\\" upholding the social dominance of white people over people of colour through societal phenomena such as white privilege. Nosheen Iqbal, who interviewed Bergdorf for The Guardian, suggested that there were many problems facing Bergdorf's desire to promote anti-racist ideas initially generated among academic circles across the wider population. As Iqbal noted, \\"Not everyone reads Frantz Fanon and Patricia Hill Collins for kicks ‚Äì academic theory will only go so far in convincing the average person on an average street that institutionalised, systemic racism is just as damaging as a violent, racist attack.\\" Aftermath Later in September, a rival beauty product brand, the UK-based Illamasqua, hired Bergdorf as the face of its Beauty Spotlight campaign, which focuses on gender fluidity. In a statement, the company described Bergdorf as embodying \\"diversity and individuality; she is not scared to be truly herself.\\" It added that it did not \\"stand or accept any form of racism, but we also believe Munroe‚Äôs comments have been edited out of context by a certain media title (who we won't bother naming) without telling a true story\\". Bergdorf had also worked for Illamasqua on a previous occasion. Also in September, Bergdorf gave a verbal performance of Maya Angelou's poem \\"Still I Rise\\" for a short film directed by Bec Evans and Laura Kirwan-Ashman. That same month, the scriptwriter Gareth Roberts referenced Bergdorf in a tweet stating: \\"I [love] how trannies choose names like Munroe, Paris and Chelsea. It's never Julie or Bev is it?\\". His tweet received headline attention in Britain. Munroe hit back at Roberts on Instagram, stating \\"Excuse me for not choosing 'Bev' as a name. Do I look like a Bev?\\". Several days later, she entered a Twitter argument with Morgan. She suggested that it was incongruous that he had not been sacked despite making many controversial statements and yet \\"somehow a black trans woman calling out [racist] behaviour is a sackable offence\\". He replied that her LGBT status had nothing to do with her losing her job with L'Or√©al, and rather that she had been fired \\"for calling all white people violent racists\\", a sacking which he agreed with. After Bergdorf then retweeted Lily Allen's statement \\"#blockpiersmorgan\\", he responded: \\"please do, you insufferable creature\\". In December, Bergdorf reappeared on Good Morning Britain as a guest alongside the black writer and broadcaster Edward Adoo, invited to discuss Twitter's newly introduced restrictions on material displaying \\"hateful conduct\\". Bergdorf supported Twitter's move, and in the interview repeatedly used the word \\"nigger\\". Adoo expressed the view that it was inappropriate to use the term so regularly on breakfast-time television, with co-presenters Morgan and Susanna Reid requesting that Bergdorf cease using it; in turn, she stated that Morgan's attempt to get her to stop was itself \\"highly racist\\". On Twitter, many users criticised Bergdorf's use of \\"nigger\\"; some stated that they found it offensive, others criticised the perceived double standard in which Bergdorf insisted on her right to use the term but expressed condemnation of white people doing so. Although acknowledging that to do so on morning television \\"may raise some eyebrows\\", after the interview Bergdorf defended her use of \\"nigger\\", stating that she did so \\"for a reason\\": \\"I wanted to highlight that the outrage of a black woman saying it around white people is often met with more outrage than the fact that black women in the media are barraged with this word by some white social media users.\\" In June 2020, during the international George Floyd protests, Bergdorf called out L'Or√©al Paris for posting on Instagram that they stood in solidarity with the Black community. She noted that she had never received an apology from L'Or√©al. In response, the company announced that they would create and appoint Bergdorf to a U.K. Diversity & Inclusion Advisory Board.

Her work relates to symbolism and musicalism (the attempt to interpret music in painting).  Biography  Louise Janin was born in Durham, to a well-off family of French descent. Her father had put together a rich collection of Asian art. After the remarriage of her mother at the beginning of the 20th century, she lived in San Francisco, witnessing the earthquake of 1906. Demonstrating from early childhood dispositions for drawing, theater and music, it was in painting that she decided to educate herself. After attending courses at the California School of Fine Arts in San Francisco from 1911 to 1914 and William Merritt Chase's last summer class in Carmel-by-the-Sea, she took a long trip through Asia, then made her first canvases inspired by Buddhist, Hindu and Taoist mythologies. In 1921, she stayed in New York and participated in various exhibitions, pursuing work influenced by Far Eastern spirituality. Two years later, she went to Europe and settled permanently in Paris.Benezit Dictionary of Artists She participated in the 1920s in the Salon des Orientalistes, in the Union of Women Painters and Sculptors Fair, in the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in 1925, in the Paris Colonial Exposition in 1931, and in the Salon des Tuileries. Personal exhibitions took place in 1924 at the Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, then four years later at the Galerie Georges Petit. In 1924 the National Museum of Franco- American Cooperation at Ch√¢teau de Bl√©rancourt Mus√©e Franco Americain acquired the canvas entitled Le dragon.(fr)Culture.gouv.fr It is at that time that her figurative paintings began to acquire abstract decorative motifs.Centre Pompidou , National Museum of Modern Art Through the poet and art critic Alexandre Mercereau, she was introduced to two significant artists, Franti≈°ek Kupka and . In 1932, she joined the musicalist movement at the request of Henry Valensi and participated in almost all of the group's events. At the onset of the Second World War, she was living in Corsica, and subsequently interned in a camp in Italy. After the war, her work became increasingly abstract.(fr)Cour16 She was an exhibitor at the Salon des R√©alit√©s Nouvelles, then at the Salon Comparaisons. It was during the 1950s that she invented a new artistic process, a mixed technique on paper, a variation of the marbling technique that led to original works visualizing the sacred in cosmic visions, which she called \\"cosmogrammes\\".Jstor, Painting with a marbling technique, first published in Leonardo (journal) Louise Janin continued to exhibit regularly at the Salon of Sacred Art, at the Salon of Women Painters and Sculptors, at the Salon d'Automne and at the Salon des Ind√©pendants, offering works incorporating symbolism, musicality and spirituality, mixing figuration and abstraction.

Biography Born in Santiago on 18 June 1768, Jaraquemada was the daughter of Domingo de Jaraquemada and Cecilia de Alguizar.. She was a relative to the Carrera Family. At the end of the Independence of Chile, Paula who was 50 years old received the Patriot Army in her hacienda in Paine (Maipo). She gave refuge to them after the defeat in the Battle of Cancha Rayada, on 19 March 1818 physically protecting them from the Spaniards. She provided the accoutrements and to revitalize the troops, she facilitated horses and ordered her servants to be part of this army. Her greatest achievement was to deal with a Spanish captain, who arrived to her hacienda to stock on supplies for his troops. The captain demanded the keys to her storehouse, but she denied stating \\"I won't never give you the keys. Nobody, except me, gives the commands in this house\\". The offices ignored her reply and once again gave the order for the keys. Paula did not give up in the argument and risking her life she took one of the bayonet from a soldier and put it in her chest. She stated, that she preferred to die instead of accepting the order. Jaraquemada is seen as a symbol of a Chilean woman standing up to authority like In√©s Su√°rez and Javiera Carrera. She is still mentioned as a role model to contemporary protestors against mistreatment.

In the semifinals, Arrigoni excluded the Catalans of Cotonificio (95‚Äì108 loss in Badalona and 87‚Äì63 win in Rieti). In the single final which held on March 20 at Hala Pionir of Belgrade, Arrigoni Rieti lost 98‚Äì108 to Partizan. In the Italian league, Arrigoni ranked 6th in the regular season and played with disadvantage in the play-off quarterfinals against the three-peat FIBA European Cup Winners' Cup champions of Gabetti Cant√π (ranked 3rd) and qualified with 2-0 wins. In the semifinals Sinudyne Bologna was superior team and eliminated Arrigoni with a score of 2-1 wins. The following season (1979‚Äì80) Arrigoni Rieti had the most successful season ever in the history of the club. In the domestic league ranked 4th in the regular season but in the play-offs eliminated in the quarterfinals by Gabetti Cant√π although it had the seat advantage. In the FIBA Koraƒá Cup Arrigoni qualified undefeated from the top 16 group stage (2. Olympiacos, 3. Joventut Freixenet and 4. Tofa≈ü). In the semifinals Arrigoni faced the famous Jugoplastika and qualified hard (1-1 wins) with the aggregate score of 183‚Äì179. In the final (March 26, Country Hall du Sart Tilman, Li√®ge), Arrigoni Rieti was found to opposite one more Yugoslav club, the emerging Cibona of Andro Knego, Aleksandar Petroviƒá and Mihovil Nakiƒá, and won the title. The next two seasons AMG Sebastiani played in the domestic league play-offs until the quarterfinals and in the top 16 group stage of FIBA Koraƒá Cup (In the first case lost the first position and the semi-finals qualification in the tie with Crvena zvezda). In the 1982‚Äì83 season Binova Rieti ranked 16th and last in the regular season and downgraded to Serie A2. In serie A2 Rieti stayed for five seasons until 1988 and then downgraded to serie B1. Until the dissolution of the club in 1997, AMG Sebastiani Basket had been moved between serie B1 and serie B2. At the end of the 1996‚Äì97 season the deficit becomes unsustainable, new buyers are sought in vain, and a stock exchange is also blurred to acquire the A2 of Pistoia. Deferred by debt, AMG Sebastiani fails to sign up for the championship and end its business after 51 years of history.

He served as Finland's ambassador to Warsaw (1958‚Äì1963), Moscow (1963‚Äì1967), Rome, Valletta and Nicosia (1970‚Äì1975) and Stockholm (1975‚Äì1980). He also served as Ambassador to Bucharest (1958‚Äì1960), Sofia (1958‚Äì1963), Kabul (1963‚Äì1966) and Ulan Bator (1963‚Äì1966).  Childhood and youth  Jorma Vanamo was born as a child of pharmacists. Vanamo belonged to the first members of the Pyk√§l√§ Association of the largest law school students in Finland and served as its third chairman in 1937‚Äì1938.  Ura  When graduating as a lawyer in 1939, Jorma Vanamo had worked in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs for more than a month. On February 1, 1939 Vanamo started at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as an unpardonable typist, and on March 3, 1939, he officially joined the Foreign Service. Vanamo was also able to prove the development that led to Winter War at the beginning of his career. The Baltic states where negotiating with o the Soviet Union on base requirements, when Jorma Valamo on 5 October 1939, was a telegraphist when Moscow sent a secret telegram to Aarno Yrj√∂- Koskinen. The central element of the telegram was the invitation of the Kremlin to negotiate concrete political issues. After the Winter War , Vanamo was sent to the office of deputy to Stockholm. At the end of the war, he was transferred to Moscow, where Juho Kusti Paasikivi served as Envoy At the beginning of the Continuation War, Vanamo received a seat from Finland as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. He was at the Political Department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and Vanamo's duties included secret telegrams. It can be said that Vanamo's career progressed very fast, for just under two and a half years after he had come to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he had already been appointed a permanent official. In the early spring of 1942, Jorma Vanamo took the cryptography course and after the course he developed secretarial systems in the Foreign Ministry. He served as secretary of state until the end of the war. Vanomo also translated the first draft of the Finno-Soviet Treaty in May 1945. When the diplomatic relations between Finland and the Soviet Union returned, Vanamo returned to Moscow in August 1945. He continued his duties in Moscow until 1948. This term also included the Finnish-Soviet treaty negotiations. Vanamo did not personally participate in the negotiations but was responsible for sending delegations of secret ballot, which was why he was well aware of the conduct of the negotiations. The Finnish-Soviet Agreement entered into force on 6 April 1948. In 1948, Vanamo moved to the post of deputy secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and became the Secretary next year . Between 1951 and 53 Vanamo was again sent to Stockholm, now the first Secretary of the Embassy and Delegation Counselor. From Sweden, he became Deputy Director General at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in the Trade Policy Department in 1953 to negotiate trade agreements with the Soviet Union. Vanamo moved to Washington DC in 1954. The area included administrative matters, consular offices, and political issues. After two years in the United States, Vanamo returned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as Head of the Administrative Department in 1956.Pekkarinen & Palokoski, 92. After two years in the United States, Vanamo returned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as Head of the Administrative Department in 1956. Jorma Vanamosta became an Ambassador in Warsaw in 1958, where he also worked for relations between Finland and Bulgaria. The Warsaw years were followed four years in Moscow in 1963‚Äì67, this time at the ambassador's post. During this time as President Urho Kekkonen, during the second time, he was convinced of Vanama's qualifications. In 1967, he was appointed State Secretary to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. During his State Secretaryshp, Vanama played an important role in dealing with the investigation of the operation of the Soviet Ambassador Aleksey Beljakov. Beljakov was revealed to support the Stalinist hardline wing of the Finnish Communist Party, which naturally strengthened the ideological role of the Soviet Union in domestic politics in Finland. The case led to the resignation of Beljakov from his post and return to his native country in the spring of 1971. After the end of the 1960s in Finland, Vanamo was sent back in 1970 to a new place of employment in Rome. Finland and Italy had not had mutual visits to date, but now President Kekkonen made a state visit to Italy in January 1971. Foreign Minister Aldo Moro made a return visit to Finland in the same spring Vanamo returned to Stockholm as an ambassador directly from Rome in 1975.

Name Bathyphysa conifera was nicknamed the Flying Spaghetti Monster, for the satirical deity of the Internet, by the oil workers who first saw it. The specific epithet conifera, meaning 'cone-bearing', is due to the shape of the cluster of reproductive structures called gonophores. In Japanese it is called / / ', \\"jewel leek\\". In Chinese it can be called ' \\"flying noodles monster\\". Distribution B. conifera has been found in the Northeast and Northwest Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of Gabon and as far south as Angola,Jones, Daniel O.B., Gates, A.R., Curry, R.A., Thomson, M., Pile, A., Benfield, M. (Eds) (2009). SERPENT project. Media database archive. Available online at http://archive.serpentproject.com/2621/ accessed on Fri Sep 01 2017 and in Monterey Bay in the Pacific Ocean. Description Close-up of B. conifera Although B. conifera may appear to be an individual organism, each specimen is in fact a colonial organism composed of medusoid and polypoid zooids that are morphologically and functionally specialized. Zooids are multicellular units that develop from a single fertilized egg and combine to create functional colonies able to: reproduce, digest, float, and maintain body positioning. It has a cystonect body plan, meaning it has a pneumatophore, or float, and siphosome, or line of polyps, but no nectosome, or propulsion medusae. Without that propulsion, B. conifera moves through contracting and relaxing the body stem. It differs from members of the genus Rhizophysa by the presence of ptera, or side 'wings', on the young gastrozooids, or feeding polyps. It is distinct from other members of the genus Bathyphysa as its tentacles do not have any side branches, or tentilla. Tentilla are thought to be ancestral to siphonophores, and B. conifera likely lost the trait as did Apolemia. The tentacles have stinging cells called nematocysts that are haploneme, or uniform in thickness, and have a single size of isorhiza, or anchoring nematocysts. The entire animal, including tentacles, is several meters long. The feeding polyps are pink when young, before developing tentacles. A mature feeding polyp is yellow with a single tentacle. Colonies are unisexual, and reproduce by incomplete asexual reproduction. Not much more is known about B. conifera reproduction. Early development of cystonects is not known either. Siphonophores generally start life as a single-celled zygote, which divided and grows into a single polyp called a protozooid. The protozooid then divides by budding into all the zooids of the colony. The zooids are homologous to individual animals, but are connected physiologically to each other. Ecology Like many siphonophores, it is carnivorous. The typical siphonophore diet consists of a variety of copepods, small crustaceans, and small fish. B. conifera has been observed eating a lanternfish. A species of manefish in the genus Caristius associates apparently mutualistically with B. conifera, using it for shelter, stealing meals, and perhaps nibbling on its host as well, yet protecting it from amphipod parasites like Themisto.

The church originated from the first Methodist congregation in Indianapolis that began in a log cabin in 1821‚Äì22 with fifty members. The congregation worshipped at several locations and erected four earlier churches on Monument Circle and along Meridian Street in downtown Indianapolis before it merged with the Fifty-first Street Methodists in 1945. The first service at its North Meridian Street location was held on June 29, 1952. Designed by the architectural firm of Russ and Harrison, the Georgian-Colonial-style, red-brick church is noted for its architecture, pipe organ (one of the city‚Äôs largest), and formal parlor. The Aldersgate addition on the west side (rear) of the church was consecrated on October 4, 1989. The church conducts midweek and Sunday worship services in addition to its ongoing religious ministry and foreign missions. During its early years, the congregation was involved in the organization of Asbury University (present- day DePauw University) and Indianapolis's Methodist Hospital. The church‚Äôs membership reached its peak in 1965 at 2,571 members, but declined in subsequent decades as the city expanded. Notable members of the congregation include former U.S. Vice President Charles W. Fairbanks; Albert J. Beverage, a two-term U.S. senator and Pulitzer Prize-winning author; James F. Hanly, a former Indiana governor and U.S. congressman; Mary Stewart Carey, founder of The Children's Museum of Indianapolis; Calvin Fletcher, an early Indianapolis citizen who helped found the city's public school system; and industrialists and philanthropists James I. Holcomb and Herman C. Krannert. History Origins The Meridian Street United Methodist Church originated from the first Methodist congregation in Indianapolis, Indiana. Initial services and the first formal religious services held in Indianapolis began in 1819 when Resin Hammond conducted services under a walnut tree. The site was near the south end of the Indiana State House and is commemorated by a plaque within the State House. In 1821 Reverend William Cravens, an ordained minister, organized a group of Methodists who began meeting in Isaac Wilson's log cabin. On September 2, 1824, the congregation acquired a log cabin on the south side of Maryland Street between Meridian and Illinois Streets for $300 and enlarged it for use as a meetinghouse that could seat 200 people. Chapel on the Circle In 1829 the congregation erected its first new church, initially called the Indianapolis Circuit or the Indianapolis Station, at the southwest corner of Meridian Street and Governor's Circle (present-day Monument Circle). The lot and small, brick church cost an estimated $3,000. The two-story church had separate entrances for males and females.Evans, pp. 19, 63. In 1842, when the city's Methodist congregation exceeded 600 members, it divided into two smaller groups, a western and an eastern charge, using Meridian Street, a major north-south thoroughfare, as a boundary line for the new congregations. The western charge, which eventually became the Meridian Street United Methodist Church congregation, remained at its chapel on the Circle. The eastern charge, which was named Roberts Chapel and later known as Roberts Park Church, relocated to a site at the northwest corner of Market and Pennsylvania Streets. (The present-day Roberts Park United Methodist Church at the northeast corner of Delaware and Vermont Streets was dedicated on August 27, 1876, as the Roberts Park Methodist Episcopal Church.)Dunn, pp. 85‚Äì86, 593‚Äì95; Evans, p. 63.Roberts Chapel was named in honor of Bishop Robert R. Roberts, the first Methodist bishop to live in Indiana. Roberts Park United Methodist Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. See: See also: In 1845 the western charge was divided again. At that time the Methodist congregation on the Circle became known as the central charge, while a new western charge established Strange Chapel to serve Methodists living west of the Central Canal. In 1846 the original chapel on the Circle was demolished and replaced with a new one on the same site. The two-story, Romanesque Revival‚Äìstyle, which was called Wesley Chapel, cost an estimated $10,000. Its sanctuary was located on the second floor; a lecture hall, library, and study were on the first floor. The Wesley Chapel congregation remained on the Circle until it sold its chapel at public action to the Indianapolis Sentinel in 1868 for $28,000. The former church became known as the Waverly Building; it was demolished in 1922. Later, the site was developed for other commercial purposes.Evans, pp. 21‚Äì22, 63. Other early sites After the Wesley Chapel congregation left its facility on the Circle in 1869, it purchased a site to erect a new church, which was named the Meridian Street Methodist Episcopal Church, at the southwest corner of Meridian and New York Streets. While its new stone church was under construction, the congregation worshipped at other locations. The new church cost an estimated $100,000. By 1870 the congregation's name had been changed to Meridian Street Methodist Episcopal Church in reference to its new location. The Gothic Revival-style church was dedicated on December 10, 1871. Its second-floor sanctuary had a seating capacity of 1,000; the lower level included a lecture hall, classrooms, a study, and a parlor.Dunn, p. 594. After the congregation's church at New York and Meridian Streets was destroyed by fire on November 17, 1904, the congregation met at the Propylaeum in University Park and elsewhere until its new church at Saint Clair and Meridian Streets was completed in 1906. The congregation was known as the Meridian Street Methodist Church from 1939 until 1968. Designed by the Indianapolis architectural firm of D. A. Bohlen and Son, the Gothic Revival-style church was constructed of Indiana limestone. The Saint Clair Street property cost $40,000; the new church cost an estimated $125,000. The church's cornerstone was laid on November 30, 1905. The facility housed the congregation until 1947. Its front facade had three oak doors beneath a large, stained-glass window. The building also included two towers with spires and had five stained-glass windows on each of the sanctuary‚Äôs north and south walls. The church's pipe organ contained 1,572 pipes. The congregation's last service at the Meridian and Saint Clair Street site was held on December 7, 1947. The church building, which still stands, was subsequently sold to the Indiana Business College.Evans, pp. 25‚Äì28, 63. On May 14, 1945, the Fifty-first Street Methodist Church congregation agreed to a merger with the Meridian Street Methodists. Until funds were raised to build a new church on Meridian Street, the combined congregation met at the Fifty- first Street facility, which was located at Fifty-first Street and Central Avenue.Evans, pp. 28, 30. Present-day church The architectural firm of Russ and Harrison designed the present-day Meridian Street United Methodist Church, which is located at 5500 North Meridian Street. The cost to construct the church in 1950 was $909,364. Donations to the church's building campaign and a mortgage paid for its construction. Its cornerstone was laid on September 17, 1950; the first service was held in the new building on June 29, 1952.Evans, pp. 31, 35‚Äì40. In 1968 the church was renamed the Meridian Street United Methodist Church following a merger of the Methodist Church with the Evangelical United Brethren Church to become the United Methodist Church.Evans, p. 63. Construction on the church's Aldersgate addition, which is connected to the main building, began in 1988; it was consecrated on October 4, 1989. A low bid submitted for the building project was $2.3 million. Funding for the construction came from donations made to the church's building campaign, as well as a mortgage.Evans, pp. 46‚Äì49. Description Notable features of the church on North Meridian Street are its Georgian- Colonial-style architecture, pipe organ, and formal parlor. The two-story church, a smaller chapel to the south, and a two-story wing that connects the church to the chapel were built in the early 1950s; the Aldersgate addition on the building's west side, at the rear of the church, was built in 1988‚Äì89. The red-brick exterior has wood trim that is painted white. The church's front facade, which faces east toward Meridian Street, includes a two-story portico with four columns. A steeple was erected at the front edge of the church's gable roof. A domed cupola rests atop the chapel's gable roof, above its front entrance.Evans, pp. 25‚Äì31, 35‚Äì40, and 46‚Äì49. The church's sanctuary has a seating capacity of 600; the chapel seats 100; and the lower level below the sanctuary contains a dining hall. The church's pipe organ is made by Casavant Fr√®res of Canada and contains more than 3,500 pipes (58 ranks, each one comprising 61 pipes). It is one of the largest pipe organs in Indianapolis and cost $26,800 when it was installed in 1952. The church's formal parlor measures by and cost $127,000 to decorate in the early 1950s with Sheraton- and Hepplewhite-style furniture. The use of the parlor was restricted to women's group meetings and receptions, including the church's Women's Society for Christian Service group.Evans, pp. 35‚Äì42, 45. Mission In addition to its religious ministry, church leaders and members of the Meridian Street congregation were involved in the organization of Indiana Asbury University (renamed DePauw University in 1884) in Greencastle, Indiana. Several of its ministers and congregational members were present when the cornerstone was laid for the school's first building and served as university trustees. Over the years the Meridian Street Methodists continued to contribute to the university's endowment.Evans, pp. 103‚Äì5. The church was also involved in forming Indianapolis's Methodist Hospital. On October 10, 1899, an organizational meeting of Methodist Hospital's board of trustees was held at the Meridian Street Methodist Church. (At that time the church was located at Meridian and New York Streets.) The church also continued to support the hospital through financial gifts. Several of its members have served as trustees of the hospital. Foreign missions have been an important aspect of the church's ministry. In the past the congregation has supported missions to several countries in Africa, as well as Indonesia, Bolivia, South Korea, and China. In addition, it has supported mission trips to aid communities in the United States and provided support to the Indianapolis community through the Fletcher Place Community Center, among others. In 1965 it also acquired a camp in Cloverdale, Indiana. The facility was renamed Camp Otto in honor of Mr. and Mrs. William Otto, who were church members.Evans, pp. 107‚Äì14. The church's United Methodist Women and its predecessors, the Women's Association and the Women's Society for Christian Service, have supported the religious needs of the congregation, in addition to conducting numerous fund-raising projects to benefit the church and its various missions. Membership The congregation formed in 1821‚Äì22 with 50 initial members; later that decade the Indianapolis Journal reported the church's membership had reached 93. By 1829 its membership had grown to 300.Evans, pp. 19‚Äì21, 65‚Äì66. In 1842, when the city's Methodists was divided into two groups, the Wesley Chapel congregation, the predecessor to the Meridian Street United Methodist Church, had slightly more than 600 members. After the division the Meridian Street congregation continued to grow. Author W. R. Holloway reported in his history of Indianapolis, published in 1870, that the church's membership was 504; however, a history of the church published in 1995 reported its membership in 1870 was 449. The congregation did not have more than 600 members again until the mid-1890s.Evans, pp. 65‚Äì66, 72. Historian Jacob Piatt Dunn Jr. reported in Greater Indianapolis (1910) that the Meridian Street Methodist congregation had reached 753 members. In 1935, prior to the merger with the Fifty-first Street Methodists, the Meridian Street congregation had fallen to 566 members. The merged congregation reached its peak in 1965 at 2,571 members, but declined as the city expanded in the 1970s and 1980s. New and even larger congregations moved to new facilities north of downtown Indianapolis and surpassed the Meridian Street Methodist Church's membership in the 1990s. Men have dominated the mostly all-white congregation's decision-making authority since the early years of its history. Very few women held leadership positions in the church prior to the merger with the Fifty-first Street Methodists in 1945. Leadership changes were slow to occur. In the 1990s the conservative and formal worship services continued to attract predominantly white, upper- middle-class members who lived in the Indianapolis metropolitan area. By 1995 about one-third of the church's elected administrative board were women and one-third of its trustees were women; a few women served on its finance and pastor-parish relations committees.Evans, pp. 74‚Äì75.

He is known for playing the Bugle which played a part when he, as a volunteer, defended the city of Burhaniye against Greek forces on the western front of the Turkish War of Independence, also known as the Greco-Turkish War (1919‚Äì1922). He played an instrumental part in the defense of the coastal town against a large retreating Greek occupational force that was burning and destroying as they retreated. Early life and military service ƒ∞smail was born in the Pelitk√∂y village of Burhaniye. ƒ∞smail was his real name. He joined the army at the age of 20 and after 1 year of service, following the outbreak of WW1, is sent to the Suez front. Together with his unit, the 28'th Tumen, he fought against English and Arabs in the desert. Many of his brothers in arms fall casualty and his unit returns to √áanakkale afterwards. He is chosen as one of the exceptional men of the 28'th Tumen to become a Bugle player and is promoted to the rank of Onba≈üƒ±. He had learned to play the bugle during battles in √áanakkale. He soon became known as Borazan (Bugle). Volunteering in the Turkish Liberation War He joined the national struggle known as the Turkish Liberation War voluntarily. Together with a small detachment of volunteers, a Kuva-yi Milliye that he formed, he moved around the back of enemy units and severed their telephone communication lines and performed frequent raids on the enemy. Saving Burhaniye ƒ∞smail √áavu≈ü prevented the destruction and burning of Burhaniye by the Greeks using his military experience. The Greeks were retreating from Burhaniye which they had occupied in the beginning of the war, and as they retreated it was common of them to leave behind the defenseless towns burned and destroyed. They intended to do the same with the town center of Burhaniye. On the Greek occupying commander bans people from leaving their homes in the occupied town and threatens that those leaving their homes will be shot. They are preparing to burn and destroy the town. This was thwarted by ƒ∞smail √áavu≈ü who with a few other men entered the occupied town undetected and positions his men in different places of the town also alerting the townsfolk of the situation and explains his plan. The plan is that when he plays his bugle everyone will create a yell and fire their guns at the same time. When it becomes dark he climbs up to the top of the minaret of the Hanay Mosque and keeps a lookout over the town. On in the early morning hours he spots the Greek enemy units approaching and he immediately starts playing the attack tune on his bugle. Bugle Attack Tune The other soldiers who had secretly entered the town with him and are ready and waiting in their positions start to fire their weapons and the townsfolk, who wake up from all that noise, now understand that the enemy has arrived and also begin to fire weapons and yell alongside the soldiers who are already firing. They trick the approaching Greek forces into thinking that the town has a large Turkish military presence that is about to ambush them and the Greeks flee from the town and continue their retreat to the west coast and the town is saved. Legacy Having served valiantly at √áanakkale and in the war of indepenence he is considered a hero by the people and is offered worldly goods such as houses, plantations, gardens and olive tree fields, however refuses them all. He did not do it for the reward, he sacrificed his life unconditionally for the love of his country and his people. He died in 1972 in Burhaniye. Around this time the well known Turkish sculptor G√ºrdal Duyar created a sculpture depicting ƒ∞smail √áavu≈ü for Burhaniye. Around 1992 this sculpture was removed by the mayor at the time. Another monument in honor of Borazan ƒ∞smail can be found in front of the Atat√ºrk statue in Burhaniye. The monument features a bugle and a revolver sitting on a stone base next to a marble slab with black text on the front face explaining the meaning of the monument. He is remembered and honored as a hero for his service and heroic deeds in saving Burhaniye.

The gate along with the restaurant is now open for public. The visitors gallery and restaurant is surrounded by glass, which will be part of the wall. From here, one can see a lot of parts of New Town, Bidhannagar, Rajarhat and Kolkata. It is a type of Welcome gate and is built by HIDCO, under the government of West Bengal. The design was finalised by calling for submission of designs through a public notice in web sites as well as newspaper advertisements. A committee headed by Architect Dulal Mukherjee was formed which evaluated the designs from various architects from around the country. The design by M/s Vector Designs, a Pune-based architecture firm was recommended by the committee. A work order was soon issued now that the design was accepted by the Board of Directors of HIDCO. The hotel is successfully running with both staircases and a lift that carries visitors to the hotel and provide a marvelous view of Neo city Newtown. Location Narkelbagan crossing, near Rabindra Tirtha in Action Area 1, New Town, Kolkata. Construction Kolkata Gate at Narkel Bagan Crossing The Kolkata Gate design was made public in 2015. The construction of the Gate started on 6 March 2017. The construction of the Gate will use around 70 tons of steel. The total cost of the construction of the Gate is expected to be around ‚Çπ25 crore. For the design of the iconic structure, a national design competition was organized and a committee headed by architect Dulal Mukherjee, oversaw design plans from architects from all over the country. Most were variations of the inverted ‚ÄòU‚Äô and catered to the wish of making the Gate a utility structure as well. The project finally went to M/S Vector Designs, a Pune-based company. The construction was carried out by a Pune firm Construction Catalysers Pvt.limited. The plan initially was to have just a viewing gallery, but later on, it was decided to have a night-time restaurant as well. Work on the proposed structure began on March 6, 2017. Steel plates were used and two inverted parabolas were erected. Not a single piece of steel was curved and the whole structure was made from flat steel. Around 70 tons of steel were used with the top portion elevated at 55 metres. All points were rigorously tested. The first sign of trouble came when the rings had to be elevated to the proposed height of 25 metres. The arch wasn't a problem since it was from the sides, but with the rings came a major traffic issue. To elevate the rings, the cross roads, on which the gate is constructed, needed to be closed down. Work was to be done through the night, between 11 pm and 5 am and permission for the same was taken from the police. The ring had four parts, two large and two small. The problem was lifting the larger parts to their designated spots and for that a full 48 uninterrupted hours would be required. That became one of the main causes for delay. Finally, the work went on uninterrupted over one whole weekend, with minimum inconvenience to traffic and the rings were elevated using large cranes. Curved, double glazed glasses, brought all the way from Bengaluru, were used in the ring. More than 20 per cent of these glasses broke on the way to Kolkata and replacing them consumed even more time. The fire department then wanted staircases along with the Glass Capsule lifts as a safety measure since it was to be for public use and spiral staircases had to be installed. The initial plan for the structure also included a Biswa Bangla Globe to be installed. One day, while it was being pulled up, the chain snapped and it crashed to the ground. Thankfully, no one was around at that time, but it was decided not to get another globe up again. Today, the Gate stands at 55 meters - A ring ‚Äî situated at a height of 25 metres and with a diameter of 220 meters around the Kolkata Gate - is a restaurant, a viewing gallery, a cafeteria and a curio shop. The ring has the support of four arc-like pillars from four sides. Decorative paintings of luminaries have been drawn on the wall inside the ring with the outer side having a glass facade to have a view of the township. Not more than 50 visitors are allowed inside the ring at a time.  Specification  Kolkata Gate Night View This gate is about 55 meters high. The circular tunnel made for the viewers is approximately 25 meters above the ground. Visitors can climb up the lifts on one side of the Gate. Decorating of the tunnel is done with several photographs of the Bengali culture, with adaptation. The outer part of the entire tunnel has lighting. The logo \\"Welcome to Kolkata\\" is put up on the ring structure to greet the incoming vehicles. The tunnel provides a 360 degrees view of Newtown with all its scenic beauty.  Reaction  This hanging restaurant is developed as a part of Newtown's beauty project. From the idea of Visitor's Gallery in Paris's Eiffel Tower and hanging restaurant in Malaysia, HIDCO has built this gate and the accompanying hanging restaurant.

She made headlines in 2019 after getting arrested in the United States for assaulting a flight attendant on a flight from Australia, for reach she received probation and community service hours. After handing down the verdict the judge told Adau he wanted her to have a wonderful life.Amy Lee Dixon, Maurice Novoa and Adau Mornyang at the Variety Australia children's charity fundraiser Miss World Australia Finalist Mornyang competed for the Miss World Australia 2017 title at the Rendezvous Hotel against 30 other contenders, there she progressed to the final eight, Mornyang vowed to use the Miss world platform to inspire people and speak out against rape in communities which sweep the criminal acts under the rug. Personal life Mornyang migrated to Australia when she was 10 as a refugee from war- torn South Sudan unable to speak English, Mornyang moved from Sydney to Melbourne on her own at age 17, and from 19 to 22 her career in modelling prospered having worked as a global campaign face for Sephora and recently in 2019 walked the runway at New York Fashion week.

Mornyang spoke out against victim- blaming but received a backlash from men in her community. Apex teen crime wave Mornyang urged South Sudanese parents and leaders in the Melbourne community to be proactive and play a more serious role of the teens who have been involved in violent crime, She believes African immigrants were not taking note of serious mental health issues in teenagers, thus turning them towards a life of violence and drug abuse. Mornyang told Herald Sun that the Sudanese community needed to integrate more by both teaching teenagers about their heritage and the local Australian cultures and laws. Positive body image Mornyang offered advice to young girls dealing with something that they feel insecure about their body by talking about her scar she received on her face. She told Teen Vogue that she embraced her scar for the way it made her different and unique, and that people will try to bully others some stage because there will always be something they dislike. Mornyang ended by stating We all have scars, some you can see, some you can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm lucky you can see mine. United Airlines incident On a January 21, 2019 United Airlines flight from Melbourne to Los Angeles, Mornyang was involved in a physical altercation with a flight attendant. Audio was released showing her drunkenly yelling obscenities and racial slurs and abused the airline crew after they investigated complaints about her behavior from fellow passengers. The incident escalated when she slapped a member of the flight crew and had to be handcuffed by a flight marshal. About two hours before the flight landed, she was allowed to use the restroom, where she stayed for the remainder of the flight. She was arrested upon the plane's arrival in Los Angeles. In March 2019, she was found guilty of a felony charge of interference with a flight crew member and a misdemeanor count of assault by a Los Angeles jury. At her trial, it was disclosed that she had to be carried out of the plane by air marshals. After her trial, she stated that she did not remember what had happened, but might have mixed prescription drugs with too much alcohol during the flight. On July 15, 2019, Adau was sentenced to 3 years probation and 100 hours of community services. Alongside, she was to receive mental health counseling and submit to drug tests. US District Court Judge Cormac J. Carney said he believed Adau was deeply remorseful for the incident and did not deserve to go to prison and that he wanted her to have a wonderful life. Adau had read a statement that she was currently trying to deal with emotions and anxiety brought on by childhood trauma through proper medical treatment, not drugs and alcohol like she had done earlier in her life.

Function  For an emoji domain to work, it must be converted into so-called \\"Punycode\\". Punycode is a character encoding method used for internationalized domain names (IDNs). This representation is used when registering domains containing special characters. The ASCII representation starts with the prefix \\"xn--\\" and is followed by the emoji-containing domain name encoded as Punycode, for example \\"xn--i-7iq\\". Each emoji has a unique Punycode representation. For example, \\"üòâ\\" in an IDN is represented as \\"xn--n28h\\". There are several generators on the Internet that allow one to convert emoji to Punycode and back.  Availability and registration  The availability of emoji domains is limited. , there are fourteen top-level domains for which registration is possible: .cf, .ga, .gq, .la, .ml, .tk, .st, .fm, .to, .je, .gg, .kz, .com.kz, .org.kz, and .ws. The registration of an emoji domain can be more difficult than with normal domain names using only ASCII characters, since it is sometimes not possible to enter emoji into the online registration forms of domain name registrars, and instead the Punycode representation must be entered. The availability of an emoji domain can be verified by using an emoji domain search engine or by checking the WHOIS data of the punycoded domain.  History  The first three emoji domains were created on April 19, 2001: ‚ô®Ô∏è.com (xn--j6h.com), ‚ô®Ô∏è.net (xn--j6h.net) and ‚òÆÔ∏è.com (xn--v4h.com).

Another problem is that emojis can look different depending on the operating system, applications, and fonts used. Not all browsers support emoji domains. On Google Chrome and Firefox, emoji display as Punycode in the address bar. In Safari, on the other hand, emoji are visible in the address bar. Emoji domains are also visible in Google and Bing search results. There are also issues with using emoji domains in social media. While they are well supported on Twitter and LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram impose serious restrictions. Support varies on messaging platforms. At present, only Punycode encoding is advised in e-mail addresses, e.g. \\"mail@xn--n28h.tld\\", as many MTAs and MUAs don't support SMTPUTF8 which would allow SMTP commands with non- ascii characters.  Emoji subdomains  Emoji subdomains are like normal subdomains, except that they begin with emoji. Emoji subdomains are possible with many popular TLDs, including .com. As with any other emoji domain, emoji subdomains have to be converted into Punycode and can then be used as regular subdomains. Thus, domain combinations like üëç.website.tld (xn-- yp8h.website.tld) are possible. This allows a wide scope of emoji domains outside of ccTLDs.

Early life Olive Ann Moorman was born in Franklin, Ohio, on July 28, 1852, the daughter of Thomas J. Moorman (1810-1883) and Mary Yates (1828-1901). In her early childhood her parents moved to Iowa, but she returned to her native State to finish her education. As a child her ambition was to become an educator, and all her energies were directed to that end. Career For thirteen years Olive Moorman Leader was a successful teacher in the schools of Keokuk, Iowa, Plattamouth, Lincoln and Seward. She was identified with school work in Seward, Lincoln and Plattsmouth successively, and, moving to Omaha, she began, in connection with the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, active work in the temperance cause. She introduced the systematic visiting of the Douglas county jails. She was one of the first workers among the Chinese, being first State superintendent of that department. In 1887, moving to Dakota Territory, she worked indefatigably for its admission as a prohibition State. During her three years' residence in Dakota she was State superintendent of miners' and foreign work in the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. In 1889 she returned to Nebraska and settled in Chadron, Nebraska. She was for two years superintendent of soldiers' work in Nebraska, and was for twelve years identified with the suffrage cause. She was an adherent of Christian Science and a strong believer in its efficacy, having, as she firmly believed, been personally benefited thereby. While living in Chadron, Leader established the Christian Science Church there. In 1901 she moved to a ranch in Cherry County, Nebraska and then in 1919 she moved again to Wood Lake, Nebraska. She was a member of the Eastern Star Work and organized the Wood Lake Culture Club. Personal life On April 5, 1880, Olive Moorman married Joseph Baird Leader (1856-1931), a pioneer railroad man on the Northwestern, and moved to Seward, Nebraska. She died on April 9, 1930, in Wood Lake, Nebraska, and is buried at Greenwood Cemetery, Chadron.

Despite the huge economic importance of his discovery, he received little recognition during his life. Monuments to Thomas in Tunisia were destroyed after the country gained independence.  Career   Early years (1843‚Äì85)  Philippe Thomas was born in Duerne, Rh√¥ne on 4 May 1843. He attended the √âcole nationale v√©t√©rinaire d'Alfort, where he was a brilliant student, and the Cavalry School. He was named an Army Veterinarian in 1865. He was assigned to Algeria but returned to France at the start of the Franco-Prussian War (1870) and fought in various engagements. He returned to Algeria after the war and took part in suppression of the revolt in the Kabylie in 1871. In his spare time, he studied geology, paleontology, and other scientific disciplines. Thomas became a qualified geologist. Thomas classified the succession of Eocene rocks in Algeria from the Mediterranean coast to the Sahara, a succession that he would again find in southern Tunisia. In 1873, in the M'Fatah massif of Algeria Thomas was the first to discover the existence of phosphated nodules from the lower Eocene. In 1875, he studied the fluvio- lacustrine terrains of the Upper Tertiary and Quaternary, and published a series of notes on palaeontology and palaeoethnology. The first, on \\"Buhalus Antiqus\\" appeared in the Bulletin of the Climatological Society of Algiers. In the same bulletin, he reported the discovery of a prehistoric workshop in Hassi-El-M'Kadden, near Ouargla. In 1876, the Soci√©t√© des Sciences physiques, naturelles et climatologiques d'Alger recognized his work between 1868 and 1875 in geology and palaeontology by awarding him a silver medal. This was soon followed by his admission to the Soci√©t√© g√©ologique de France. Between 1880 and 1884, Thomas published several papers on his Algerian research, and with the mining engineer Jules Tissot (1838‚Äì83) investigated the Eocene formations in the Constantine region, where Tissot suspected the presence of calcium pyrophosphate. Thomas was the first to discover phosphates in the province of Ras El Aioun, Algeria.  Tunisian Scientific Exploration Mission (1885‚Äì86)  Monument to Philippe Thomas in Tunis In 1882, Jules Ferry, Minister of Public Instruction, decided to create a mission to explore the Regency of Tunisia. The expedition was headed by the botanist Ernest Cosson, who had already undertaken eight study trips in Algeria between 1852 and 1880. It included the botanist Napol√©on Doumet-Adanson and other naturalists. The botanists undertook their work in 1883 and 1884. In 1884, a geological section under Georges Rolland was added to the Tunisian Scientific Exploration Mission. Rolland was assisted by Philippe Thomas from 1885 and by Georges Le Mesle in 1887. Thomas was 42 when he started his exploration of Tunisia. He was assigned to the expedition at the recommendation of the paleontologist Jean Albert Gaudry, and because Jules Ferry knew his ability and perfect knowledge of the Arabic language. Rolland covered the centre of the country, while Thomas worked further south and Le Mesle worked mainly in the north, apart from an expedition to the extreme south. The team gave good descriptions of the Jurassic of the Zaghouan region and the Eocene of the Maktar and Kairouan regions. In 1885‚Äì86, Thomas explored the southern area of Tunisia between the meridian of Kairouan and the Saharan chotts, covering a vast area. He also explored the western area, which his colleagues had neglected, particularly the Cha√Æne du Thaljah or Cha√Æne du Tseldja mountains that stretch westward from Gafsa into Algeria. He identified the geology of the Gafsa chain with that of the M'fatah massif in Algeria and on 18 April 1885 found phosphates at Jebel Tselja. He found a brown or greenish gray limestone that on average contains 60% tricalcium phosphate near M√©tlaoui, where the Cretaceous limestone axis of the mountains joins the Eocene foundations. Thomas crossed the Cha√Æne du Tseldja through the dramatic gorges of the Oued and found identical phosphate deposits on the southern slope of the range extending for at least . Thomas sent rock samples to the √âcole des Mines de Paris for analysis, and on receiving the results on 18 October 1885, informed Dr. Cosson, head of the mission. The discovery had great economic and agricultural importance. With Cosson's authorization, he informed the French Academy of Sciences on 7 December 1885. He completed his observations in the 1886 exploration campaign in southern and central Tunisia up to Kalaat es Senam.  Later career (1887‚Äì1910)  Place Philippe Thomas, Sfax. The bust of Thomas in the center of the square was later torn down. Thomas sent a second note to the Academy of Sciences in 1887 and a third in 1888, in which he described his 1878 observations and the Algerian deposits. He did not have the time or resources to travel the Dyr of T√©bessa to confirm the presence of the phosphates that he expected to be found there, but the deposit was found as predicted and was the first to be exploited. Philippe Thomas published the palaeontology results of the Scientific Exploration Mission in six instalments plus an atlas, giving the work of Victor-Auguste Gauthier (sea urchins), Arnould Locard (Mollusca), Auguste P√©ron (Brachiopods, Bryozoa, and Pentacrinitess), and Henri √âmile Sauvage (fish). Thomas was promoted to First Class Veterinarian in 1895. When he retired, he was made an officer of the Legion of Honour. In 1898, a member of the Institute of Carthage revived interest in his work. When the Sfax‚ÄìGafsa railway was inaugurated in 1899, Thomas was made a member of the Tunisian Order of Glory. In 1900, he was awarded a small pension of 6,000 francs. In 1904, he was awarded a Gold Medal by the Geographic Society of France. Thomas continued to send regular notes on his findings until 1909. In 1902, the Ministry of Education proposed that Georges Rolland should write up the results of the Scientific Mission, but he refused for health reasons. The task was given to Thomas, who was now in retirement. He wrote the Essai d'une description g√©ologique de la Tunisie with the support of Jean Albert Gaudry, Alphonse P√©ron, and Paul Bursaux, technical director of the Compagnie des phosphates de Gafsa. The first part, an Overview of physical geography, was published in 1907. The second part, Stratigraphy of the Palaeozoic and Mesozoic terrains, was published in 1908. Thomas described the great density of marine fauna at the dawn of the Tertiary that had created the layers of phosphates and the coastal fauna of the later Eocene layers characterized by the great vertebrates, particularly Sauria and giant turtles, and very numerous Plagiostoma bivalves. Thomas died before completing the third part of the Essai. In 1909, when he was dying of disease, the Soci√©t√© des Phosphates de Gafsa awarded him 25,000 francs, to be added to the 6,000 francs life annuity from the Tunisian government. Philippe Thomas died on 12 February 1910 in Moulins, Allier, France at the age of 66.  Legacy  Monument in Thomas's memory in Tunis, since dismantled. The third part of Thomas's Essai d'une description g√©ologique de la Tunisie, which was to have described the Tertiary formations, was completed and published by his friend, Professor L√©on Pervinqui√®re (1873‚Äì1913), holder of the Chair of Geology at the Faculty of Science in Paris. √âmile Haug published the Essai d'une description g√©ologique de la Tunisie after Pervinquiere had also died and presented it to the Geological Society of France in session on 6 April 1914. The V√©t√©rinaire G√©n√©ral L√©on-Paul-Charles Vivien wrote, On 10 December 1908, the Bey Muhammad an-Nasir gave Philippe Thomas's name to the Metlaoui station in recognition of the prosperity that his discovery of phosphates of lime had brought to the country. A medallion was placed in front of the station. A monument with a bust of Thomas by the sculptor Andr√© C√©sar Vermare was inaugurated in Sfax by Gabriel Alapetite, Resident-General of France in Tunisia on 26 April 1913. Alapetite inaugurated another monument in honour of Thomas in Tunis on 29 May 1913. Thomas's bust in Sfax and that of the olive-grower Paul Anthelme Bourde were thrown down and shattered on the night of 3‚Äì4 January 1957. The monument in Tunis was toppled soon after.

It has been owned by members of the Wolf/Wolff-Sneedorf family since 1830. The main building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places by the Danish Heritage Agency in 1918. History Banjamin Wolf Engelholm was created when the former Vordingborg Cavalry District (Vordingborg Ryttergods) was divided into 12 estates and sold by the crown in the middle of the 1770s. One of them, until then known as Skovbygaard, was sold to Hans Petersen, a local master butcher. He had previously been indicted for charging double prices for all deliveries to queen dowager Juliane Marie's household but was acquitted due to lack of evidence. He was able to buy the estate after marrying the wealthy widow of a miller in 1773. She was called Inger Engel, and Hans Petersen named the estate after her. Hans Petersen completed a new main building on the estate in 1785, and prior to that had also improved the farm buildings. Their son Peter Benedict Petersen took over the estate after his father in 1803. The manor fell into neglect during the crisis years of the 1800s and 1810s. Peter Petersen's heirs sold Engelholm to Ludvig Georg C√∏ln in 1824. He was also hit by economic difficulties and the estate therefore entered administration by the Treasury (Rentekammeret) in 1827. In 1830, the Treasury sold Engelholm to Benjamin Wolff. He had studied law at the University of Copenhagen before travelling to Calcutta, where he was employed by the trading house Cruttenden, Mackillop & Co., of which he later became a partner before returning to Denmark as a wealthy man in 1829. In 1832, he married Julie Sneedorff. They kept a large household at Engelholm. Their guests included Bertel Thorvaldsen and Adam Oehlenschl√§ger. Wolf was an amateur painter and had also built a collection of local drawings and watercolours in India which he supplemented with Danish works after his return to the country. In 1855, Wolf also purchased the estate Grevensv√¶nge. Wolf's eldest son, Hans Christian Theodor Wolf, who had served as a military officer in the Second Schleswig War, inherited the Engelholm in 1866. He and his brother Germer Wolf changed their last name to Wolff-Sneedorrf the following year in accordance with a wish made by their father in his will. Hans Christian Theodor Wolff-Sneedorrf was also bank manager of the local savings bank in Pr√¶st√∏. None of his sons outlived him and in 1906 he chose to cede Engelholm to his brother, who had already inherited Grevensv√¶nge after their mother's death in 1875. Germer Wolff- Sneedorrf was a military officer with rank of rittmeister and chamberlain. He passed Engelholm on to his son Knud Wolff-Sneedorf in 1925. Architecture The main building is from 1781-85\\\\. It is an 11 bay long, one-storey building with Mansard roof and a two-storey, three-bay avant corps on both sides. The building is rendered yellow with white details. A staircase with Rococo railing in the vestibule connects the two floors. The ceiling in the music room features a gilded rosette. The main building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places by the Danish Heritage Agency on 2 July 1918. Surroundings Peter Benedict Hansen created an English style landscape garden to the east of the house. It was later redesigned by the landscape architect rik August Flindt in the 1780s. The garden contains the grave of Hans Petersen as well as a family tomb for the Wolff-Sneedorf family.

This was the first album released by the label for the band. This was also the first album to be released on shops by the band, and also the first where the band had professional recordings. Informations Background The Kelly Family was formed in 1974, initially as a hobby by the older siblings, Caroline, Kathy, Paul and John, and one of their cousins, Maribel, when they lived in Spain. They mainly played at other children's parties or in the streets. Popularity began to grow and the hobby became more serious, as Dan and Barbara Kelly joined their sons on the stage. Dan Kelly opened a bar in 1974 called La Vida where the band and others could play, but eventually closed it after the bar became too popular for the freedom of their children. In 1975, the family started to tour in Europe, without Maribel. So Patricia learned to play the guitar in two weeks (thanks to Caroline) and she joined the band, aged only 6. In 1976, while Papa Dan was showing Rome to his children, all of their money was stolen in their double-decker bus, leaving only their passports and their instruments. After that, the Kellys continued to play in the streets, in order to finish the return trip. They also released two albums without professional recordings in 1977 and in 1978. By this time, also Jimmy and Joey had joined the band. At mid-1978, the label Polydor offered them a contract, which Papa Dan accepted. The family then moved to Germany and lived in a camp, in order to record songs in Polydor's studios in Hamburg. Their first recordings were for the songs Danny Boy and Agur Jaunak, which were both released as a Double A-side single in 1978. The album Ten Kellys took part in the album: Dan, Barbara, Caroline, Kathy, Paul, John, Patricia, Jimmy, Joey and Barby. The older child, Danny, did not took part because of a disability, but he briefly took part in home music. Though they were present on this album, Barbara, Paul and Barby have no lead vocals here. Many of the tracks from this album were also recorded and released in 1977 in their first album, Kelly Family Tours Europe. All the tracks were produced by J√ºrgen Kramer and Peter Schirmann and arranged by Schirmann and Dan Kelly. This album features traditional tracks or cover of famous songs. Five of them are English, four Spanish, two in Basque and one German. The first song recorded for this album was Danny Boy.

In 2020, he returned to compete in the show's 40th season, Survivor: Winners at War., finishing in 5th. Early life Driebergen attended Capital High School in Boise, Idaho. When he was about 12 years old, his father came out to the family and his parents separated. After graduating in 2001, he eventually enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. During his time in the Marines, he served in Iraq, attaining the rank of Lance Corporal. Once, while stationed in Fallujah, he came across an elderly couple that couldn't evacuate the city due to the wife's illness. As other civilians were being cleared out of the place, LCpl. Driebergen and his squad agreed to watch over them. After a week of protecting the two civilians, the couple was able to make it out of town on their own, unharmed. Survivor Heroes v. Healers v. Hustlers In 2017, Driebergen participated in Survivor: Heroes v. Healers v. Hustlers, the 35th season of Survivor. He was initially placed on the Levu tribe, also known as the Heroes tribe. On Day One, he formed an alliance with Alan Ball, JP Hilsabeck, and Ashley Nolan. When Levu lost the first immunity challenge, Driebergen joined the rest of the Heroes in voting out Katrina Radke. Following her elimination, he aligned with Chrissy Hofbeck. Following the tribe switch, he was switched to the Yawa tribe, where he was the only original Levu member, and in the minority. He also took a dislike to new tribemate Cole Medders due to the latter's eating habits. Driebergen made it to the merge on Day 17. Going into the first post-merge Tribal Council, he and his ally Lauren Rimmer were the swing votes. Both he and Rimmer sided with the Yawa and Levu members at Tribal Council resulting in the elimination of Soko member Jessica Johnston. On Day 25, he and Rimmer, Nolan, and Devon Pinto, formed a Final Four alliance. The next day, Driebergen stumbled on a clue to a Hidden Immunity Idol and managed to find the idol. On Day 27, Pinto suggested that Driebergen play double agent by voting against Mike Zahalsky while his new alliance blindsided Hilsabeck, shocking Driebergen's former allies Hofbeck and Ryan Ulrich. On Day 33, Driebergen suspected his alliance was plotting against him. At Tribal Council, everyone voted against him, but he played his idol negating the six votes cast against him, and his sole vote blindsided Rimmer. This was the first time in Survivor history that someone was able to negate all of the other votes at Tribal Council with a Hidden Immunity Idol. On Day 36, he found a clue to another idol, and found it moments before Tribal Council. He played the idol before the votes were cast which resulted in Nolan's unanimous elimination. The following morning he found a third idol, tying Russell Hantz in Samoa, Tony Vlachos in Cagayan, and Tai Trang in Game Changers for the record of most Hidden Immunity Idols found in a season, with three. At Tribal Council, he played the idol, which negated the three votes against him, while voting against Pinto, resulting in a 1‚Äì1 tie between Pinto and Zahalsky. In the revote, Zahalsky was voted out. On Day 38, Driebergen lost the final immunity challenge to Hofbeck. During Tribal Council, Hofbeck revealed that since she won immunity, she had to choose one person to bring to the Final Three with her, while the other two castaways were to go against each other in a fire-making challenge. She chose to save Ulrich, forcing Driebergen and Pinto to compete in the fire challenge. Driebergen easily won the challenge, joining Hofbeck and Ulrich in the Final Three. Driebergen received mixed reception during the Final Tribal Council. He was applauded for finding multiple idols, and his strong strategic play, but was condemned particularly by Joe Mena for his weak social game. When Zahalsky and Mena encouraged Driebergen to explain why he believed he should win, he opened up to the jury about his post-traumatic stress disorder and how he has learned to live with it, stating that he hoped to show fellow veterans that while life after the military is difficult, there is more to look forward to in the future. Driebergen was ultimately awarded the title of sole Survivor with five of the eight jury votes. He earned everyone's vote except Nolan, Zahalsky, and Pinto; the former two voted for Hofbeck while the latter voted for Ulrich.

Along the way, Driebergen was immediately pegged as a potential leaker of information when he unintentionally brought up a plan by Danni Boatwright to blindside Rob Mariano in Mariano's presence. Following the Tribe Switch, Driebergen was moved to the new Yara tribe along with former Sele tribemates Mariano and Adam Klein, where they joined Sophie Clarke and Sarah Lacina. Having chafed under Mariano's domineering style of gameplay since the start of the game, Driebergen and Klein turned on Mariano at the earliest opportunity, voting him out at the subsequent Tribal Council. After reaching the merge, Driebergen found himself in a comfortable position, having joined Tony Vlachos's majority alliance. Driebergen had developed strong bonds with Vlachos, Lacina, Clarke and Denise Stapley during this time. However, his already fractious relationship with Klein started to sour even further, and the two of them would come to distrust each other as the game wore on. Furthermore, Driebergen quickly developed a rivalry with Jeremy Collins, who had found himself on the wrong side of the numbers at the merge. Collins's attempts to align with Driebergen fell on deaf ears, as Driebergen's faith in his alliance was strengthening with each passing day. On Day 29, he found a Hidden Immunity Idol in Vlachos's presence, further cementing their bond. On Day 31, he received his first elimination votes of the season: from Collins and Michele Fitzgerald. However, Collins's luck ran out and he was voted out. On Day 34, seizing an opportunity to take a shot at the majority alliance, Nick Wilson played his disadvantage on Driebergen, forcing him to set up a 30% longer line of blocks, causing Driebergen to come second in the immunity challenge to Fitzgerald, who was the initial target for that round. However, this wound up backfiring as Wilson was voted out instead. When Natalie Anderson rejoined the game from the Edge of Extinction, Driebergen sensed she and Fitzgerald were going to take another shot at him, so he played his idol at the Final Six, negating two votes cast against him, resulting in a 0-0 tie. Due to this, Driebergen was forced to vote between two allies: Lacina and Stapley, who were the only eligible players left to vote out. Driebergen wound up siding with Lacina and voted out Stapley. On Day 37, Vlachos won his fourth immunity challenge and Anderson found a hidden immunity idol. Knowing that the jury viewed his game unfavorably and not willing to risk being raked over the coals in Final Tribal Council, Driebergen advised Lacina that if she wanted to differentiate her game from Vlachos, she would have to make a big move on her own. Having seen the writing on the wall for his own game, Driebergen gave Lacina his blessing to vote him out, stating that the friendship he'd built with her was more important to him than his dwindling shot at winning the game. That night, Driebergen and Vlachos voted for Fitzgerald, but Lacina, Fitzgerald and Anderson voted for Driebergen. Driebergen joined the jury having come to terms with his fate and accepting it. At the Final Tribal Council, Driebergen specifically credited Fitzgerald's win in Survivor: Ka√¥h R≈çng and praised her gameplay, stating that as a \\"fellow controversial winner\\", she should be proud of her achievement. Nevertheless, Driebergen voted for Vlachos to win, which he did in a 12-4-0 vote, making him the second two-time winner in Survivor. Personal life After completing his service to the Marines, Driebergen worked several regular or odd jobs around the United States. He reconnected with his father and was working at a bar where he met his current wife, Kelly Russell. He proposed to Russell after the birth of his son, Wyatt. At the time of his Survivor casting, he was employed at a grocery warehouse. He currently works as a real estate agent in Boise, where he lives with his wife Kelly, and their two children, Wyatt and Gracie.https://www.bendriebergen.com/ References External links *Official CBS biography page Living people People from Boise, Idaho Survivor (American TV series) winners United States Marines 1983 births ","title":"Ben Driebergen"},{"id":"55114648","text":"Sister Mary-Joy Langdon is a nun who was the first woman to be an operational firefighter in Britain.

Women were very involved in the project which eventually had 30 different libraries serving 100,000 people. Pack horse librarians were known by many different names including \\"book women,\\" \\"book ladies,\\" and \\"packsaddle librarians.\\" The project helped employ around 200 people and reached around 100,000 residents in rural Kentucky.  Background  A pack horse librarian reads aloud to a man in the Kentucky mountains. Because of the Great Depression and a lack of budget money, the American Library Association estimated in May 1936 that around a third of all Americans no longer had \\"reasonable\\" access to public library materials. Eastern, rural Kentucky is a geographically isolated area, cut off from much of the country. Prior to the creation of the Pack Horse Library Project, many people in rural Appalachian Kentucky did not have access to books. The percentage of people who were illiterate in eastern Kentucky was at around 31 percent. People who lived in rural, mostly inaccessible areas wanted to become more literate, seeing education as a way to escape poverty. While there were traveling libraries, which were created by the Kentucky Federation of Women's Clubs starting in 1896, the lack of roads and population centers in eastern Kentucky discouraged the creation of most public library services in those locations. The traveling libraries were discontinued in 1933. In Kentucky, 63 counties had no library services at all during the early 1930s. The first Pack Horse Library was created in Paintsville in 1913 and started by May F. Stafford. It was supported by a local coal baron, John C.C. Mayo, but when Mayo died in 1914, the program ended because of lack of funding. Elizabeth Fullerton, who worked with the women's and professional projects at the WPA, decided to reuse Stafford's idea. In 1934, A Presbyterian minister who ran a community center in Leslie County offered his library to the WPA if they would fund people to carry the books to people who could not easily access library materials. That started the first pack horse library, which was administered by the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) until the WPA took it over in 1935. By 1936, there were eight pack horse libraries in operation. Description 350x350px The Pack Horse Library Project was headed by Ellen Woodward at a federal level. The project ran between 1935 and 1943. \\"Book women\\" were hired by the WPA and worked for around $28 a month delivering books in the Appalachians via horseback or on mules. They delivered both to individual homes and to schoolhouses. The WPA paid for the salaries of the supervisors and book carriers; all books were donated to the program. Members of the community had to not only donate books but also provide facilities to store the books and other supplies needed by the librarians on horseback. Each local pack horse library had a clerk, or head librarian, who handled various library duties and four to ten book carriers who delivered books to mountain schools and homesteads. The head librarian would process donations at the headquarters, repair books and get items ready to deliver. Librarians repurposed items like cheese boxes into card catalog files or license plates bent into shapes for bookends. Monthly, the librarians would meet at their central facility in what they called \\"conferences.\\" Most of the people involved in the Pack Horse Library Project were women. Most of the pack horse librarians were the only person in their family who was then earning an income. Book carriers provided their own horses or mules, some of which were leased from local farmers. Some routes were so steep that one book woman, Grace Caudill Lucas, had to lead her horse across the cliffs. Other areas had deep water and her feet sometimes \\"froze to the stirrups.\\" Another librarian chose to hike her 18 mi route on foot after the death of her mule. One librarian had a very old mule and so walked with her animal part of the route instead of riding. Over the course of a month, women would ride and walk their route at least twice, each route covering a week, totaling an average of . The book packs that the librarians carried could hold around 100 books. left Books were rotated between locations and were chosen based on the preferences of the library patrons. The collection of the libraries were focused on children's books. Maggie Mae Smith, a supervisor at the Whitley County Pack Horse Library wrote that the children all ran to meet the book women, saying, \\"Bring me a book to read.\\" For adults, the collection focused on current events, history, religion and biographies. The Bible was one of the most requested books, along with \\"instructive literature.\\" Other popular books were Robinson Crusoe and literature by Mark Twain. Women enjoyed reading illustrated home magazines and books about health and parenting. Another unique aspect of the collection was the recipe and quilting pattern books that women created, writing down their favorites into binders which were shared throughout the area. The scrapbooks also contained cuttings from other books and magazines and eventually, there were more than 200 different books generated by patrons and librarians. In 1938, four Tru-Vuers with 40 films were purchased to circulate through the different libraries so that people could see their first moving pictures. The books were in such demand that one young man walked to the closest pack horse library to get new books. In 1936, around 33,000 books were circulated to around 57,000 families. The lending period for books was usually about a week. Parent Teacher Associations (PTA) and women's clubs in Kentucky were key to helping raise money to purchase new books. Lena Nofcier, who was involved in promoting the book donation program through the PTA, helped raise money by book drives and penny donations. In Paintsville, Kentucky, the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) helped pay shipping expenses for the books donated. The head of the library in Paintsville, Stafford, also solicited books by writing to the editor of The Courier-Journal. PTA's in Kentucky helped promote the Pack Horse Library Project. Local communities held book drives and open houses to support libraries. The Pack Horse Library Project not only distributed books but also provided reading lessons. Librarians and book women would also read aloud to families. Librarians were also seen as educators, bringing new ideas into isolated areas. In order to do so, librarians had to deal with their community's suspicion of strangers and deal with a \\"hostility toward any outside influence\\". The librarians managed to overcome the attitude to such a degree that one family was reported as refusing to move to a new county because it lacked a packhorse library service. The project ended in 1943, when the WPA stopped funding the program. While local communities tried to keep the libraries going, they were unable to continue without funding. It was only in the 1950s that the remote communities would have access to bookmobiles.  Locations  Carriers in Hindman, Kentucky. There were around 30 different pack horse libraries who served around 100,000 different people in the mountain areas. The libraries also served around 155 schools in these counties by 1937. Breathitt County was an early pack horse library location, opening in 1935. Campbellsville, Kentucky opened a pack horse library on November 3, 1938. The head of the project was Louise S. Van Cleve. Burkesville in Cumberland County started up a pack horse library in 1938 that had around 1,000 books and 3,000 magazines in the collection. To obtain books for a planned Floyd County library, an open house was held in Prestonsburg in 1938. The supervisor for Floyd county was Grace Moore Burchett, who oversaw services at Prestonsburg, Martin, Lackey and Wheelwright. Greenup County started a pack horse library in 1939. Hindman was the central location for Knott County which had a pack horse library in 1935. By 1937, there was a pack horse library in Lee County. A major headquarters was located in Lexington. Letcher County also had its own library. London, Kentucky in Laurel County was one of the more centrally located pack horse libraries. The center was run by Ethel Perryman, who was a local director of the WPA, women's work division. London also served as a central receiving area for book donations. One large central book distribution program was run out of Pittsburgh by Mrs. Malcolm McLeod, wife of the head of the English department at Carnegie Tech, who sent her donations to London. The first location to have a pack horse library was Johnson County, Paintsville. Leslie's collection was donated by their minister, Benton Deaton, who kickstarted the project. The pack horse library in Leslie started in the Wooton Community Center. A pack horse library existed in Martin County by 1941. The headquarters of the pack horse library in Morehead experienced a fire in 1939. In Owsley County, they had a pack horse library by 1937. Paintsville, Kentucky revived its original pack horse library idea when the WPA funded it. May F. Stafford was in charge of the project there. The Painstville library had grown to hold around 5,000 books by 1938. It was estimated that it cost around $40 a month in rent and utilities to run the central facility for the pack horse library. The Pikeville pack horse library was run by Naomi Lemon. Pine Mountain school was the headquarters for the pack horse library in Harlan County, which had been opened up by 1937. The supervisor of the library in Harlan County was Ann Richards, a WPA employee. In 1936, the WPA began planning to open a pack horse library in Somerset, Kentucky. The Somerset library was supervised by Imogene Dutton. By 1937, there was a pack horse library in Whitely County. Maggie Mae Smith was the supervisor at that location.  In literature  Several books have been written about the Pack Horse Library Project. That Book Woman (2008), by Heather Henson and illustrated by David Small, is a children's book that introduces children to the project. Another children's book that mentions the pack horse libraries is The Great Depression for Kids (2015) by Cheryl Mullenbach. In 2010, Kathi Appelt and Jeanne Cannella Schmitzer published Down Cut Shin Creek, a non-fiction book that describes the travels of the book women and men who helped deliver books throughout eastern Kentucky. Poetry about the \\"book women\\" has also been written. The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek (May 2019) by Kim Michele Richardson, a native Kentucky author, was published as historical fiction. The song \\"Book Woman of Troublesome Creek\\" was created in May 2019 as a tribute to the book, with words and music by Ruby Friedman. In October 2019, Jojo Moyes published The Giver of Stars, a fictionalized version of one woman's involvement in the project. On October 7, 2019, Richardson accused Moyes of writing a novel with alarming similarities to her own, and was quoted as saying \\"None of the similarities found in Moyes' novel can be chalked up to the realities of history, nor can be found in any historical records, archives or photographs of the packhorse librarian project initiative that I meticulously studied. These fictional devices/plot points were ones I invented.\\"  In media  The NPR series The Keepers, \\"stories of activists, archivists, rogue librarians, curators, collectors and historians\\", devoted an episode to the Packhorse Librarians of Eastern Kentucky. The episode originally aired on Morning Edition September 13, 2018. A \\"director's cut\\" of the story can also be heard through the Radiotopia podcast \\"The Kitchen Sisters present\\".

He was admitted at Lincoln‚Äôs Inn on 3 April 1761 and matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge at Easter 1762. He succeeded his cousin Sir Trafford Smyth, 4th Baronet in the baronetcy on 8 December 1765. In 1766 he was awarded MA and in 1775 MA.

Early life Pearlretta Weller was born on June 27, 1871, in Waterloo, Iowa, the daughter of Zachariah H. Weller and Eliza Klingaman, and moved to California in 1887. Music Zither Pearl Weller Severance Dupuy was a noted zither player, usually performing with her sister, Daisy Weller. On June 24, 1893, Professor M. S. Arevalo gave a successful concert at the YWCA Auditorium, Los Angeles; Arevalo was a well known musician of rare talent, and the concert was a triumph; the prelude of the concert was a march, arranged by Arevalo, given by the guitar club composed by the following artists: L. L. Taggart, Pearl W. Severance, Lizzie Thayer, Mabel McFarland, H. T. Longstreth, H. Brodrick, V. Wankowski, and M. Carrizosa. On November 23, 1897, she gave a zither concert at Blanchard-Fitzgerald Hall in Los Angeles, assisted by Maud Priest and Lillian Weller, guitars, Daisy Weller, zither, and M.S. Arevalo, guitar. She performed also outside California; on February 23, 1894, she played at the Baptist church in Phoenix, Arizona. According to the record, every seat available was filled and included the elite of the city. The concert was far above the average and she was highly praised for the performance. On February 3, 1906, she performed at the First Brethren Church in her native Waterloo, Iowa. Club leadership Ebell of Los Angeles Pearlretta DuPuy was president of the San Pedro Woman's Club in 1908; she resigned from the position but in October 1916 she was named again president replacing Mrs. Richard C. Goodspeed, resigning on account of serious illness. The Woman's Club of San Pedro, Los Angeles District, was organized in January 1906 and federated in November 1907. The members met every first and third Tuesday first at Liberty Hall, 264 Fifth St. and then moved at the Masonic Hall, 525 1/2 Beacon St., San Pedro, California. DuPuy was the first vice-president of the General Henry Martyn Robert Parliamentary Club of Los Angeles. During the meeting of the Robert Parliamentary Club, parliamentary questions were asked at members and Robert's Rules of Order was the reference manual. On November 27, 1920, she led a debate upon the subject \\"Shall Women Give up the Battle for Community Property Rights?\\" She was active in civic and club affairs. She was a charter member of the Los Angeles Women's Athletic Club, Ebell of Los Angeles, the Republican Study Club, the San Pedro Golf and Country Club, the California Bridge Club, the Wednesday Afternoon Whist Club, the Dutch Club. In 1908, DuPuy was on the organizing committee for the 8th Annual Meeting of the Los Angeles District of the California Federation of Women's Club to be held in Venice, California. On January 15, 1912, DuPuy was on the committee organizing the visit of leading members of Women's Clubs in Los Angeles. In 1924, DuPuy was among the 150 Republican women of Los Angeles supporting the presidential campaign of Calvin Coolidge; in particular DuPuy was representing San Pedro.

Cars of InMotion Ignition In 2009, a group of students from the University of Applied Sciences of Utrecht presented their graduation project: an eco- friendly formula race car, the Formula Bio. Their dream was to participate in the Formula Student, a race similar to Formula 1, only for students. The Formula Bio stood for environmentally friendly and inexpensive race cars. After they graduated, one of the group members went to study at Eindhoven University of Technology. This student, Albert Maas, came into contact with Maarten Steinbuch InMotion,[ https://www.inmotion.tue.nl/en/ourstory \\"How it All Began\\"]. Together they came up with the idea of participating in the 24 Hours of Le Mans with a fully electric car. In 2012, the InMotion student team was officially established. Fusion The Fusion with Beitske Visser behind the wheel. The Fusion is the fastest electric formula car in the world, with a top speed of 246 km/h. The Fusion is built to break track records of circuits, and not to fit into a particular ranking, so the car does not have to meet certain restrictions. How is the car so fast? This is due to a combination of different techniques. The propulsion is important, and also the aerodynamics of the car. The small size of the car also plays a role. Below are some facts to get a better understanding of the Fusion. * The car weighs 650 kilos in total, of which the monocoque weighs 60 kilos * The Fusion has reached a maximum speed of 246 kilometers per hour * The full power of the car is 400 kW The InMotion team launched its first full electric racing car in 2016. The car was based on the former Formula Bio car has been built on a carbon fiber chassis. The full electric engine has a better power to weight ratio compared to a Formula E car. The car made its track debut at Circuit Zandvoort during the 2016 Masters of Formula 3 event. Drivers Xavier Maassen and Jan Lammers gave the car a shakedown. In 2017 USF2000 driver Rinus van Kalmthout did a straight line test at the Automotive Campus Helmond test track (part of the A270 motorway). During the year the team improved track records for electric cars at two tracks. Beitske Visser improved the record at Zandvoort. Testdriver Maassen beat the track record for electric cars at Circuit Zolder, previously held by Bert Longin in a Tesla Roadster. =Aerodynamics= :Keeping the test platform on the road requires a lot of downward pressure. The most important parts of the car that generate this pressure are the diffuser, the front wing and the rear wing. The diffuser is the floor plate of the car, which is shaped so that it creates a lower pressure under the car and thus generates downforce. The rear wing consists of three elements, one of which is adjustable. The front wing is similar. Both wings can be removed from the car so that the aerodynamics specialists can test them and gain more insight into the air flows. This is mainly done with the program ANSYS Fluent, using simulations to investigate aerodynamics. Then the data is supplemented with results from our test drives. =Monocoque= :The monocoque is made of a composite with sandwich structure, which is also used in other open wheel race cars. The monocoque is not only made for drivers of average length, but even for drivers up to just under 2 meters. The total weight of the chassis is only 60 kilograms, including the bulkhead and the paint. The drivers all have her or his own pre-formed seat, making them comfortable and protected against unexpected movements. =Propulsion= :The propulsion is one of the main reasons why this car is so fast. Our battery pack is about 1/3 of the total weight of the car. The Fusion has rear-wheel drive, with two Yasa 750-series engines. At the Circuit Zandvoort the car achieved a maximum speed of 246 kilometers per hour. In addition, various safety measures have been taken to ensure safety. The battery pack is constantly monitored by the battery management system, and at the smallest deviation the current is removed. =Electronic control unit (ECU)= :The car contains many sensors that measure parameters such as temperature and resistance, and which register data for the models. By connecting the ECU to our computer you can read these measurements. ICT Automatizing and InMotion have designed the ECUs for the Ignition together. ICT has given the access to their Motar platform, which consists of the hardware and software of the ECU. InMotion has created the control algorithms in MATLAB and Simulink. With the Motar-Toolbox they can generate production class software based on AUTOSAR of the model at the touch of a button. Vision The Vision is a fully electric Le Mans prototype under development. Unlike the Fusion, this car is also built for its endurance. The Vision will be unique because it will be the first fully electric race car to participate in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. In the Garage 56 category, InMotion can use the innovative technological developments to make the race car as fast and environmentally friendly as possible. Engineers of the team have already thought about the following topics for the Vision: fan system for downforce, suspension, electric powertrain, aerodynamics and the monocoque. The team has gained knowledge about most of these topics by building the Ignition and the Fusion. Furthermore, there have been several graduation projects on various topics regarding the Vision. The most important difference between these cars and the Vision is the focus on charging time. The concept car is an embodiment of the future for electric driving. The ultimate goal of the team is thus literally visible and tangible. The aerodynamics of the concept car have already been carefully thought out and designed by the team. The concept car is the embodiment of future electric mobility. The ultimate end goal of the team is now made attainable. The outline of the concept car has been carefully designed and engineered by the team. Making the end goal closer to reality, by our team tackling the primary technical challenge, charging times. Student team Passion and ambition are the great motivations of the student team. The team consists of full-time members, part-time members, and trainees. Together, from all kinds of different disciplines, they work on one mission. The uniqueness of the InMotion student team is the ultimate goal, not an annual project. Everyone who has worked with them is seen as part of the team. In addition, the team receives regular advice from the 'technical advisory board' and 'supervisory board'. The Supervisory Board ensures that the project continues to follow a uniform line over the years. The technical advisory board consists of experienced members who meet weekly with the current engineers in order to guarantee the transfer of knowledge and to help with problems.
