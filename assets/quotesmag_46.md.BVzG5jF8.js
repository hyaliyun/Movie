The other ideological founders of the concept were another Austromarxist, Karl Renner, in his 1899 essay Staat und Nation (State and Nation),All of Renner's essay is reproduced in an English translation in and the Jewish Labour Bundist Vladimir Medem, in his 1904 essay Di sotsial-demokratie un di natsionale frage (Social Democracy and the National Question). 1943\\\\. “Di sotsial-demokratie un di natsionale frage” (1904).

Medem In his 1904 text, Medem exposed his version of the concept: > \\"Let us consider the case of a country composed of several national groups, > e.g. Poles, Lithuanians and Jews. Each national group would create a > separate movement. All citizens belonging to a given national group would > join a special organisation that would hold cultural assemblies in each > region and a general cultural assembly for the whole country.

The national movements > would be subject to the general legislation of the state, but in their own > areas of responsibility they would be autonomous and none of them would have > the right to interfere in the affairs of the others\\". Supporters This principle was later adopted by various parties, among them the Jewish Socialist Workers Party from its foundation in 1906, the Jewish Labour Bund at its August 1912 Conference (when the motion \\"On National Cultural Autonomy\\" became part of the Bund's program), the Armenian social democrats, the Russian Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets) at its June 1917's Ninth Congress,Bill Bowring, \\"Burial and resurrection, Karl Renner's controversial influence on the \\"national question\\" in Russia\\", in the first Ottoman then Greek Socialist Workers' Federation of Thessaloniki, the left- wing Zionists (Hashomer Hatzair) in favour of a binational solution in Palestine, the Jewish Folkspartei (inspired by Simon Dubnov, who had developed a concept of Jewish autonomy close to Bauer's), and the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania (DAHR) after 1989. Opponents The whole concept was strongly opposed by the Bolsheviks. Stalin's pamphlet Marxism and the National Question (1913) was their ideological reference on the matter, along with Lenin's Critical Remarks on the National Question (December 1913), in particular in the chapter \\"Cultural-National Autonomy\\". (Stalin was later People's Commissar of Nationalities from 1917 - 1923.) Lenin's and Stalin's critiques of the national personal autonomy concept were later joined by the Catalan Andreu Nin in his article The Austrian School, National Emancipation Movements (1935). Implementation It was adopted as an official policy in the short-lived Ukrainian People's Republic (1917–1920) and in the interwar Estonian Republic (1925 Law on Personal Autonomy), and it was included in the Declaration Concerning the Protection of Minorities in Lithuania by the League of Nations in 1925. The autonomous representative structure of the Palestinian Jews between 1920 and 1949, the Asefat ha-Nivharim, can also be considered as an implementation of the national personal autonomy principle. Since the fall of the Soviet Union and its satellites regimes, the national personal autonomy is the principle on which legislation applying to ethnic minorities has been enacted such as Estonia's (1993 National Minorities Cultural Autonomy Act), Hungary's Act LXXVII of 1993 on the Rights of National and Ethnic Minorities, Latvia's 1991 Law on Unrestricted Development and Right to Cultural Autonomy of Latvia's Nationalities and Ethnic Groups, Lithuania's 1989 Law on Ethnic Minorities, Russia's 1996 Law on National-Cultural Autonomies, and Ukraine's 1992 Law on National Minorities.

Applications of blade grinders for preparing foods include numerous electric kitchen appliances such as blenders (including immersion blenders), food processors, some garbage disposals, and some coffee grinders. The terms \\"blade grinder\\" and \\"propeller grinder\\" are in popular use to distinguish the blade grinder type of coffee grinder from other types. Other consumer applications include rotary lawn mowers. Design A blade grinder may be considered a type of hammermill. A blade grinder resembles a meat grinder in that both have propeller-shaped cutting blades. However, meat grinders (and food mills) use a scissor cutting action as the blades rotate against a perforated metal plate. Meat grinder blades rotate at a much slower speed than blade grinders, which may rotate at speeds as high as 20,000 to 30,000 rpm; for example, the Steele model mixer-grinder by Indian appliance manufacturer Preethi has a no-load speed of 23,500 rpm and loaded speed of 11,500rpm. Blade grinders also resemble industrial blade (propeller) mixers, which like meat grinders rotate at much slower speeds. Unlike blade grinders, these mixers do not alter (break, cut, shred, macerate, pulverize) the material being mixed. The high speed of rotation of blade grinders is necessary to achieve their cutting action. In a blender application, the high speed of rotation contributes to shearing, which in turn contributes to aeration and the formation of emulsions. These are desirable qualities in many food preparations. A blade grinder can run on batteries or more commonly on utility electricity. History Blade grinders are a 20th-century innovation that followed the adaptation of propellers to small motorboats. Blade grinders exploit a feature of propellers that is undesirable in the propulsion systems of boats and airplanes: the higher the rotation speed, the more energy is spent in shearing and cutting rather than in pushing. Rotary lawn mowers were not developed until small engines became powerful enough to run the blades at a speed high enough to cut. Commercial blenders were developed in the 1920s. With increasing miniaturization of the electric motor, the first consumer blender, the Waring Blendor, was developed in the 1930s, and a canister blender, the Osterizer, entered the market in 1946. The first immersion blenders were patented in the 1950s. Types =Coffee grinders= Special purpose coffee grinders usually are either blade grinders or burr grinders: blade grinders being less expensive and having additional uses, burr grinders giving a better quality of grind. Special purpose spice grinders usually are either blade grinders or mortar and pestle (or related tools). Low cost coffee blade grinders for use in home kitchens frequently are difficult to clean. The Joy of Cooking (1997 edition) suggests a blade grinder may be cleaned by grinding a few tablespoons of sugar then wiping it out. Another suggestion is to clean around the blade with a soft brush or a damp cloth. Because these blade grinders frequently are used for grinding both coffee beans and spices, cleaning them well is important to prevent unwanted transfer of flavors. Some people keep two blade grinders, one for coffee and the other for spices. =Pharmacy, restaurant, and laboratory grinders= Blade grinders for home grinding of coffee beans are commonly used for grinding spices. However, larger, more powerful versions are used, particularly in Asia. Commonly found in pharmacies in China for grinding Chinese traditional medicine, the blades of this style of grinder can rotate at 28,000 rpm or more and are capable of reducing hard dried roots to powder. This type of grinder is also used in restaurants for spices as well as for laboratory use. =Blenders= Blenders are blade grinders designed specifically for use with wet ingredients. Blenders are popular tools for production of purées and pastes, using both the cutting and shearing effects of high speed blades. =Food processor= A food processor is similar to a blender. The primary difference is that food processors use interchangeable blades and disks (attachments) rather than a fixed blade. Also, their bowls are wider and shorter, a more proper shape for the solid or semi-solid foods usually worked in a food processor.

Life  Benjamin Pitman was born October 12, 1815, in Salem, Massachusetts. His father was Benjamin Cox Pitman (1790–1845) and mother was Sally Richardson (1789–1858). He had two sisters: Sally (died 1822) and Mary Elizabeth (died 1825). Benjamin Cox Pitman came to the Hawaiian islands on trading missions with Stephen Reynolds in 1826 and 1828. He brought his son in 1833 and settled in Hilo, Hawaii. About a year later, the younger Pitman married Chiefess Kinoʻole o Liliha, who controlled vast lands under King Kamehameha III. On September 11, 1845, his father died and was buried in the new Oahu Cemetery. Around 1846, he opened a small thatched hut with only a mat over a floor of bare earth at the rim of Kilauea volcano called Volcano House. He charged $1 a day, but eventually gave up the remote site. He opened a store in Hilo (called a ship chandler) to supply whaling ships. As the whaling business grew, so did his fortunes. He started added \\"Esq.\\" at the end of his name and acted as district magistrate, but there is no record of his being educated in law. In 1849 a visitor described him as the major businessman in town. By 1852, he was growing coffee, arrowroot, and sugarcane, and served as vice president of the Royal Hawaiian Agricultural Society. He employed Chinese laborers on his sugarcane plantation. Pitman served as customs collector and first postmaster on the island of Hawaii. In 1854, after the Hilo Boarding School and Church started by Sarah Joiner and David Belden Lyman burned down, he raised funds to rebuild it. His children with Kinoʻole were Mary Pitman Ailau (1838/41–1905), Henry Hoʻolulu Pitman (1845–1863), and Benjamin Franklin Keolaokalani Pitman (1852–1918). Kinoʻole died in 1855. He married for a second time on August 5, 1856, on Oahu. Maria Louisa Walsworth was born in Cleveland, Ohio, May 20, 1822, married Rev. Henry Kinney, and had come in 1848 as missionary to the island. When Kinney's health failed, they traveled to California, where Kinney died in 1854. Walsworth moved back and married Pitman, but she died on March 6, 1858, in Hilo. Daughter Maria Kinoʻole Pitman (1858–1905) married Fred Morey of Chicago in 1881. His third wife was Martha Ball Pitman (1824–1902) with whom he had two sons: Charles Brooks Pitman (1860–1918) and Harold Albert Pitman (1865–1948). Pitman family house in Brookline, Massachusetts When his business partner Reynolds died in 1859, Pitman became sole owner of the plantations, and built a house in Honolulu. About two years later, he sold his Hilo residence, which Pitman built at Niopola in 1840, and the sugarcane plantation at Amauulu (Puueo) to Thomas Spencer, and moved back to Boston so the children could attend school there. The Spencer House, as it became called, was later converted into the Hilo Hotel, which was torn down in 1956. In January 1868 he founded a \\"Hawaiian Club\\" in Boston. For a period in the 1870s, Pitman and his family lived in Germany. The Pitman family marker at Mount Auburn Cemetery The family met future Queen Liliʻuokalani on her visit to Boston in 1887. His daughter Mary Pitman Ailau had been a bridesmaid with the Princess at Queen Emma of Hawaii's wedding. Pitman died on January 17, 1888, at Somerville, Massachusetts. He was buried in a family plot in the Mount Auburn Cemetery. Henry Hoʻolulu served in the American Civil War as a private in the 22nd Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry. He was captured, and died on February 27, 1863. Benjamin F. K. Pitman married Almira Hollander (1854–1939) in 1875 and became a partner in his father-in-law's law firm, L. P. Hollander & Co. Almira became active in the movement for Women's suffrage in the United States, and the two returned to visit Hawaii in 1917. Their son Benjamin attended Harvard College, and their other son Theodore Pitman became a sculptor, dedicating a monument to his ancestors in 1928. Another Theodore, their great-grandson, donated a manuscript of notes from 1836 to 1861 to the Bishop Museum in 2007.

He was one of the educated gangsters and had some degree of unfinished education. Surve was known for his daredevilry and strategic planning. As a young man and graduate of Kirti College, Surve was implicated in a murder that he did not commit and was sentenced to imprisonment in Yerwada Jail. Within just two years of activity, his crew rose to such prominence that the Pathans, who had ruled the underworld for over two decades, sought his help in murdering the Konkani-speaking Kaskar brothers, Dawood and Shabbir, the leaders of their archrival gang, D-Company. Following the murder of Shabir Ibrahim, Surve's fellow accomplices began to fall off one by one. Noticing this, Surve laid low. Meanwhile, local law enforcement was preparing operations to reduce persistent mob violence with an onslaught of targeted assassinations. Inspectors Isaque Bagwan and Raja Tambhat, with Senior Inspector Y. D. Bhide, was put in charge of taking down Surve. Surve's was killed in 1982 by the Maharashtra police which is regarded as the city's first encounter killing. Biography =Early years= Manohar Arjun Surve was born in 1944 in the village of Ranpar in the Konkan region, located in the Central Deccan Division of the erstwhile Bombay Presidency, British Indian Empire. The village is now a part of Ratnagiri Taluk, Pawas Tal & Ratnagiri District, Maharashtra, India. Surve moved to Bombay with his mother and stepfather in 1952. For years, he lived in different chawls in Elphinstone Road and Lower Parel. He was a Chemistry graduate from Kirti M. Doongursee College, Mumbai, achieving a high score of 78%. He then fell into street life, eventually forming a crew consisting of former classmates. During these years, he was introduced to his best friend and associate Sumesh Desai through his stepbrother Bhargav Dada. Dada was a feared criminal from Agar Bazar in Dadar. In 1969, Surve, Dada and associate Manya Podhkar were all charged in the homicide and gang assault of a man named Dandekar. The trio were soon caught by Police Inspector E. S. Dabholkar and sentenced to life imprisonment. =Imprisonment and escape= While incarcerated at the Yerwada Central Jail in Pune, Surve developed a fierce rivalry with gangster Suhas (\\"Potya Bhai\\") Bhatkar. Annoyed by Surve's terror tactics, the prison authorities had him transferred to Ratnagiri jail. There, he took part in a hunger strike and lost almost 20 kg before being transferred to the local civil hospital. Surve utilized this opportunity to escape on 14 November 1979 and returned to the streets of Mumbai, having served over nine years of his sentence. =Mumbai underworld= After he returns to Mumbai, Surve formed another outfit and recruited his two trusted lieutenants, Sheikh Munir from Dharavi and Vishnu Patil from Dombivili. They were soon joined by another gangster, Uday Shetty, in March 1980. The group's first robbery took place on 5 April 1980, in which they stole an Ambassador car. The vehicle was later used to loot Rs 5,700 from the Laxmi Trading Company near Currey Road. On 15 April, Surve and his associates brutally assaulted and nearly killed Sheikh Aziz, an enemy of Sheikh Munir, near Kala Killa in the Dharavi slum. On 30 April, they stabbed a police constable when he was escorting rival Vijay Ghadge to a police station in Dadar. Borrowing the plot from a James Hadley Chase novel, which he had read in prison, Surve decided to loot money from the government milk scheme in a bid to gain money as well as recognition from the Mumbai underworld. The group, with the addition of Dayanand, Parshuram Katkar, and Kishore Sawant, stole a car near Badal Bijlee Barkha in Mahim and went on to execute a heist of Rs 1.26 lakh near Govandi. The stolen vehicle was later found abandoned near National College in Bandra, exactly as penned in the Chase novel. Another famous robbery undertaken by Surve's group included Rs 1.6 lakh from Canara Bank's branch on Sion-Trombay road and Duke and Sons Company at Deonar. Surve's criminal activities were not confined to heists and robberies. He was also involved in narcotics trafficking, as he saw that the profits derived from it were considerable. The group's various successful heists and robberies brought a tremendous amount of attention. As a result, the police were put under great pressure to deal with Surve, and they launched Operation Manya Surve to capture and curb his criminal activities. On 22 June 1981, Sheikh Munir was picked up from a chemical company near Kalyan. A few days later, Dayanand and Parshuram Katkar were arrested at a lodge in Goregoan. Anticipating his capture, Surve slipped into an aide's hideout in Bhiwandi but quickly fled on 19 November 1981. When police finally broke into the apartment, they recovered a hand grenade, a country-made revolver, and live ammunition. Surve was finished after systematic police operations led to a crackdown of his criminal enterprise. After the arrest of his cohort Uday, he was the only remaining member of the group who was not in prison. =Encounter= On 11 January 1982, Surve took a taxi to the Ambedkar College junction in Wadala. It is believed Mumbai police received a tip from Dawood Ibrahim that Surve would be arriving at a beauty parlor near the Ambedkar College junction there. It is also theorized that his girlfriend Vidya revealed his whereabouts at that time, as was shown in the movie Shootout at Wadala. At around 1:30 pm, 18 Crime Branch officers split into three teams and waited for him to arrive. After twenty minutes, Surve was spotted exiting a taxi to pick up his girlfriend Vidya. After noticing several men closing in on him and taking positions, Surve pulled out his Webley & Scott revolver. However, before he could fire a shot, police officers Raja Tambat and Isaque Bagwan fired five bullets into his chest and shoulder. Surve was dragged from the scene and put in an ambulance. This encounter was the end of Surve's spree of urban crime. This happened due to his involvement in Dawood's brother. Surve's death became known as Mumbai's first recorded encounter killing.

It was designed in 1917 by church member Giles M. Smith of the noted Boston architectural firm of Bigelow and Wadsworth (later Bigelow, Wadsworth, Hubbard and Smith), who patterned it after Thomas Jefferson's The Rotunda at the University of Virginia and the Pantheon in Rome. Due to cost constraints it was built in two phases between 1924 and 1930. The basement and ground floor levels topped by a belt course comprised the first phase, while the additional four stories and the massive dome comprised the second and final phase. The dome itself was designed and built by the noted Guastavino Fireproof Construction Company, which in 1898 had done the reconstruction of the dome in The Rotunda at UVA and the construction in 1906 of the dome of the Mother Church Extension in Boston. Guastavino used its patented tile arch system consisting of Akoustolith, a porous ceramic material resembling stone, on the interior, with limestone on the exterior. The tile was manufactured at its plant in nearby Woburn. In 1933 copper flashing was added to the exterior of the dome in order correct a leakage problem. An oculus provided light to the interior.

The diocese lapsed in 1941. Prior to this, it was a diocese of the Assyrian Church of the East, from which the Chaldean Catholic Church originated.Fiey, POCN, 107–8; Tfinkdji, EC, 505–11; Wilmshurst, EOCE, 72–5  Background  The old town of Mardin Fiey’s list of the Assyrian bishops of Mardin is derived principally from the list compiled by Tfinkdji in 1913. Tfinkdji's treatment of the diocese of Mardin, where he was himself an Assyrian Chaldean Catholic priest, is more than usually detailed, but although containing much valuable information is not free from error. From the middle of the eighteenth century onward, most of the Chaldean bishops of Mardin were buried in the city's church of Rabban Hormizd and the dates of their deaths were recorded in their epitaphs. These dates were used by Tfinkdji, and most of them also appear in an undated note made around the end of the nineteenth century in a manuscript in the Mardin collection, which lists the bishops of Mardin from Basil Hesro (ob. 1738) to Peter Timothy Attar (ob. 1891), giving wherever known the dates of their consecration and death. The author of the note is not known, but may have been Tfinkdji himself, despite occasional discrepancies in some of the dates given. Details of this kind, based on first-hand knowledge and personal recollection, can probably be trusted. Elsewhere, particularly for the early history of the diocese, his evidence is contradicted by other sources, and cannot be relied upon. The Chaldean diocese of Mardin appears to have been founded in the second half of the sixteenth- century, either by Yohannan Sulaqa or (more probably) his successor Abdisho IV Maron, after Saluqa broke from the Assyrian Church of the East in 1553 AD. Tfinkdji gave the following list of supposed bishops of Mardin from 1194 to 1512, apparently contained in an evangelary copied in 1621: Yaqob of Amid (1194–1227); Isaac of Nisibis (1229–51); Marqos of Mardin (1252–75); Denha of Maiperqat (1280–1301); Quriaqos of Dunaysir [according to Tfinkdji the old name of the Mardin village of Tel Armen] (1305–17); Stephen of Mardin (1319–40); Giwargis of Resh Aïna (1345–61); Eleazar of Kfartutha (1364–75); Samuel of Edessa (1378–95); Yohannan of Seert (1397–1400); Yahballaha of Gazarta (1400–09); Yalda of Amid (1410–29); Peter of Mardin (1431–45); Sabrisho of Gazarta (1448–68); Eliya of Mosul (1470–86); and Timothy of Hesna d'Kifa (1488–1512). This list is of very doubtful authenticity. Firstly, although some of its names are plausible, it is surprising to find Assyrian bishops from the West Syriac centres of Resh Aïna, Kfartutha and Edessa, and the names Eleazar and Samuel are also rarely found in the Assyrian Church of the East. Secondly, none of the bishops named is mentioned elsewhere. Finally, the list conflicts with other evidence indicating that Mardin was not a separate diocese until after the schism of 1552. In the literary sources Mardin appears three times in the title of the Assyrian Church of the East bishops of Maiperqat, but not as a separate diocese. The patriarch Yahballaha II (1190–1222) was bishop 'of Maiperqat and Mardin' before becoming metropolitan of Nisibis in 1176; the bishop Yohannan 'of Maiperqat, Amid and Mardin' was present at the consecration of Makkikha II in 1257; and the bishop Ishodnah of 'Maiperqat, Amid and Mardin' was present at the consecration of Denha I in 1265. Furthermore, the dating formulas of manuscripts copied in Mardin in 1502 and 1540/1 mention the patriarch Shemon VII Ishoyahb and, respectively, the metropolitan Eliya of Amid and the metropolitan and natar kursya Hnanisho. Neither colophon mentions a bishop of Mardin. The metropolitan Ishoyahb of Nisibis, a supporter of Shemon VII Isho‘yahb and his successor Eliya VII, is styled 'metropolitan of Nisibis, Mardin, Amid and all Armenia' in a colophon of 1554, and 'metropolitan of Nisibis, Mardin and Armenia' in colophons of 1558 and 1560. The earlier title may have been intended to challenge the authority of Sulaqa's metropolitan Eliya of Amid, and both styles may be evidence that Mardin was at this period loyal to Shemon VII Ishoyahb and did not yet have its own bishop.  The Chaldean bishops of Mardin  Mardin was ranked as a suffragan diocese of Nisibis in the list of Abdisho IV Maron in 1562, together with the dioceses of 'Tallescani' and 'Macchazin'. Presumably these were East Syriac villages near Mardin and Nisibis, but they have not been localised. This reference is of some interest. The first indisputable metropolitan of Mardin was Hnanisho, a native of the Mardin village of Tabyatha, who copied at least seven manuscripts between 1564 and 1586. According to Tfinkdji, he was one of the five bishops consecrated by Yohannan Sulaqa after his return from Rome in 1553 and this may well be true, though Tfinkdji's authority for this claim is not clear. Alternatively, as he is not mentioned before 1564, it is perhaps more likely that he was consecrated by Sulaqa's successor Abdisho IV Maron. He was certainly a supporter of the union with Rome, as the catholicus Abdisho IV is mentioned in the colophon of his earliest manuscript. He also copied a manuscript in the monastery of Mar Yaqob near Seert in 1569, the patriarchal residence of Abdisho IV. Hnanisho was one of the signatories of a letter of 1580 from the fourth Catholic patriarch Shemon IX Denha to pope Gregory XIII. In 1582, he visited Jerusalem, where he celebrated the feast of the Resurrection on 15 April. He completed a copy of a manuscript at Mardin on 10 December 1586, and was not among the metropolitans who witnessed the profession of faith of Eliya VII at Alqosh a fortnight later on 23 December 1586. An archbishop Hnanisho 'of Mansuriya', probably the same man, is included in Leonard Abel's 1587 list of 'the most literate men in the Nestorian nation'. Hnanisho may have died shortly afterwards. Thereafter, until 1615, Mardin appears to have been under the jurisdiction of Yaqob, metropolitan of Nisibis. Yaqob is mentioned in the report of 1607 as 'metropolitan of Mardin', and in 1614 is styled 'metropolitan of Nisibis and Mardin' in a letter of Peter Strozza. According to Tfinkdji, the next three seventeenth-century metropolitans of Mardin were Yohannan (1615–41), Joseph (1641–78), and Shemon of Amid (1682–95). The source for some of these dates is not clear, and the evidence from the dating formulas of manuscripts is contradictory. The title of Timothy, metropolitan of Amid between 1615 and his death in 1621/2, also included Mardin, suggesting that Yohannan's reign began in 1622 or later. The metropolitan Yohannan of Mardin, said by Tfinkdji to have died in Nisibis in 1641, is mentioned in the dating formulas of manuscripts of 1635 and 1645. The name and (presumably incorrect) reign-dates of the metropolitan Joseph were contained in a note in an East Syriac manuscript copied in 1679 and seen by Tfinkji in a Jacobite church. Shemon of Amid is said to have been consecrated by Joseph I, and to have died at Mardin in 1695. According to Tfinkdji Timothy Maroge, who succeeded Joseph II as patriarch of the Chaldeans in 1714, was metropolitan of Mardin between 1696 and 1713. According to his own account, however, which has been preserved in the Vatican archives, he was metropolitan of Amid, though he also ministered to the Chaldeans of Mardin. The bishop Basil Hesro of Mardin was one of three bishops (with Basil of Amid and Shemon of Seert) consecrated by Joseph III before his departure for Rome in 1731. According to Fiey, following Tfinkdji, he was consecrated in 1714, but in the patriarch's own account the two Basils were consecrated 'one after the death of the other'. Since Basil of Amid died in 1728, Basil Hesro must have been consecrated between 1728 and 1731. He seems to have died in September 1738. In March 1739, the patriarchal administrator Shemon Kemo and the clergy and people of Amid and Mardin wrote several letters to Joseph III at Rome to inform him of Basil's death and to plead for Joseph's return. These letters state that he died on 26 September 1738 and mention that he had been appointed patriarchal vicar by the Sacred Congregation. He was the first bishop of Mardin to be buried in the church of Rabban Hormizd, and according to his epitaph in the church died on 25 September 1738, a day earlier than the date given in the Vatican correspondence. A note in a manuscript in the Diyarbakr collection gives the date of his death as 10 January 1739, probably incorrectly. Basil Hesro was succeeded shortly after his death by the priest Yohannan of Mardin, who was consecrated by Joseph III and also took the name Basil in honour of his predecessor (Tfinkdji). He cannot have been consecrated in 1738, as Tfinkdji stated, as Joseph III only returned to Amid at the end of 1741. He is probably to be identified with the 95-year-old metropolitan of Mardin mentioned by Cardinal Tamburini at the beginning of 1757 as the sole surviving Catholic bishop in the Amid patriarchate (following the recent deaths of the patriarch Joseph III and the metropolitan Timothy Masaji of Amid). He consecrated Lazar Hindi metropolitan of Amid on 8 February 1857, and according to his epitaph he died shortly afterwards, on 25 February 1758. Yohannan was succeeded by the metropolitan Shemon of Amid, apparently consecrated by Joseph III in 1758. In 1782, he intervened to secure protection for the Syriac Catholic patriarch Michael III Jarweh, who was persecuted by the Jacobites of Mardin after his conversion to Catholicism. According to his epitaph, he died on 19 November 1788. Shemon was succeeded in 1795 by the priest Mikha'il Shawriz of Seert, the brother of the metropolitan Peter Shawriz of Seert. According to the patriarch Yohannan VIII Hormizd, whose account is quoted by the Anglican missionary George Percy Badger, he was consecrated between November 1793 and 14 February 1794 in an irregular manner on the initiative of Augustine Hindi: > All this time I had received no letters from Diarbekir or Mardeen, for it > appears that they would not receive the orders of our lord the Pope; on the > contrary, Kasha Agostîn went to Sert, where there was a presbyter named > Michael. Him he took to one of the Tcawâlakha [Jilu] Metropolitans and got > him consecrated Metropolitan, and set him over Mardeen without the consent > of our lord the Pope.Badger, Nestorians, i. 158 Because of the irregularity of his consecration, Mikha'il was excommunicated by the Vatican but was absolved by pope Pius VI in 1795 and confirmed as bishop of Mardin. Tfinkdji, followed by Fiey, gives the date of his death as 3 April 1810. Mikha'il was succeeded by Ignatius Dashto of Alqosh, a monk of the monaster of Rabban Hormizd, who was born in 1794 and ordained a priest in 1821. According to Tfinkdji, he was consecrated by Augustine Hindi in 1824 but according to another source, he was consecrated in 1827 and died on 12 July 1868. According to Badger, he was consecrated by Augustine Hindi (who liked to style himself Mar Joseph V) along with four other monks and was sent to Mardin to embarrass Yohannan Hormizd: > Mar Yoosef took upon himself to send Mutran Michael to Sert, and Mutran > Ignatius to Mardeen, though this latter town had been placed under the > jurisdiction of Mutran Hanna by the Pope himself.Badger, Nestorians, i. 158 Ignatius Dashto was succeeded by Gabriel Farso, who was consecrated in 1870 and died on 27 June 1873. He was succeeded by Peter Timothy Attar, who was consecrated metropolitan of Amid in 1870 and transferred to Mardin in 1873 on Farso's premature death. He died on 1 November 1891, but seems to have been succeeded as metropolitan of Mardin some years before his death by Yohannan Eliya Mellus, c.1887–1908. A number of manuscripts in the Mardin collection, some of which were later donated to the Vatican, formed part of the personal collection of the metropolitan Yohannan Eliya Mellus in the 1880s. In 1910, became metropolitan of Mardin, but the 1918 Assyrian Genocide eliminated the Chaldean presence in Mardin, and the diocese was abolished after his death in 1941.  Population  The modern day Chaldean population of Mardin is said to include only one family, and they hold the key to the Chaldean Catholic Church of Mardin, which is still maintained but inactive. The Church is now under the control of the Chaldean Catholic Archeparchy of Amida. =Historic censuses= In 1842, the diocese of Mardin consisted only of the town itself, which had a church, four priests, and 60 Chaldean families (Badger). In 1852 the diocese of Mardin and Nisibis contained 500 Chaldeans (Marchi). In 1867, the diocese contained 2 villages and had a population of 1,000 Chaldeans, served by 2 priests (Martin). In 1896, the diocese of Mardin had 850 Chaldeans, with a parish for Mardin itself, and four stations, one of which was near Nisibis (Chabot). There were then 3 priests, assisted by a Capuchin house in the diocese. In 1913, the diocese of Mardin consisted of 1,670 believers, with 6 priests, a church, 2 chapels, 3 schools, and 2 mission stations (Tfinkdji). The majority lived in Mardin itself. There were also small Chaldean communities living alongside much larger groups of West Syriac and Armenian Christians in Midyat, Nisibis, Derik, Viransehir, and the village of Tel Armen. The only significant Chaldean settlement left in the vicinity of Mardin was the village of Issadeir, several miles to the north. In 2005 the Chaldean Catholic Church was reopened, and served 5 Chaldean families. Due to the absence of a Chaldean Catholic priest, the church is managed by a local Syriac Orthodox priest.

While at the VA, Sowers represented and advised the Secretary of Veterans Affairs on matters relating to media relations, public affairs, and intergovernmental affairs. He has testified before the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs regarding the VA's efforts to increase the number of veterans accessing their VA benefits. Sowers served as a primary spokesman for the VA, making appearances in numerous national print and televised media. He served in the post until April 2014. = Collegiate teaching = From 2006 to 2009, Sowers served as an Assistant Professor at the United States Military Academy at West Point, teaching courses in American Government, Advanced American Government and Media & Politics. While at West Point, Sowers led a cadet summer trip to India, focused on service learning in the Himalayas and interaction with the Tibetan Government in Exile, including an audience with the Dalai Lama. In fall 2009, Sowers taught in the History and Political Science Department at the Missouri University of Science and Technology in Rolla, Missouri. In April 2014, Sowers accepted a position as visiting faculty in the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University.

Hacking for Defense was featured in NPR and in Duke Magazine. = Business and entrepreneurial experience = In 2011, Sowers became a management consultant with McKinsey and Company. During his time at McKinsey he was trained in their mini-MBA program and served private equity clients in assessing mergers and acquisitions, predominately in Latin America. In 2015, Sowers, along with fellow founders Shayne Sowers and Narayan Krishnan, created the firm now known as GoldenKey an online marketplace focused on unbundling the real estate industry. GoldenKey offered home owners the opportunity to unbundle services—listing, home showing, transaction coordination, etc. or choose a flat rate bundle to sell their homes. In March 2016, Fortune Magazine listed GoldenKey as a top Raleigh-Durham start-up to watch. During the summer 2016, Sowers led GoldenKey through its participation in the NFX Guild accelerator program. In 2016, GoldenKey was named by CNN as one of the five startups \\"changing the real estate game\\". In 2017, Forbes named Goldenkey as one of the top 25 veteran founded start-ups. In September 2018, Landis, a data science specialty service used to help institutional real estate developers buy and sell residential real estate, acquired GoldenKey. The acquisition of GoldenKey allows Landis to better serve their home buyers, enhancing productivity by providing vital data in regards to what home buyers are actually looking for, and how much they are willing to spend. It deepens the relationship between sellers, brokers, title insurance companies and other participants in the real estate field. Over the life of GoldenKey, Sowers led the raising of over $3.7M of venture capital with an institutional round led by Lowe's Ventures. = NSIN--National Security Innovation Network = In 2018 Sowers rejoined federal service as Southeast Regional Director of MD5 National Security Technology Accelerator, a US Department of Defense program researching ways to improve the problem-solving capacity of war-fighters. In regards to the Southeast expansion of MD5, Sowers stated, “MD5 looks to connect the venture and academic communities to warfighters to solve national security problems. The Triangle’s density of top public and private universities and the Southeast’s top entrepreneurial ecosystem all within a few hours of the greatest concentration of elite Army, Marine, Air Force and Special Operations Forces, makes Durham the perfect location for our expansion. On August 31, we’ll start proving out what right looks like by connecting these outstanding, elite communities to do good for our nation.” Sowers and the MD5 team intend on connecting elite tech and military communities in The Research Triangle to create a collaborative environment for the betterment of the nation. MD5 focuses on supporting military and veterans transitioning from active duty to careers in tech companies. They feature three portfolios of programs and services: education, collaboration, and acceleration. The education portfolio incorporates programs bringing innovation methods and the tools of entrepreneurship to the DOD workforce. Sowers himself is scheduled to teach an upcoming MD5 course at Duke titled “Hacking for Defense” where students focus on solving National Security problems through coding.  Political endeavors  thumb In September 2009, Sowers announced his candidacy for Congress against incumbent Representative Jo Ann Emerson. Libertarian Rick Vandeven and Independent Larry Bill also ran. On Veterans Day 2009, former Clinton White House official Paul Begala featured Sowers in an op-ed, calling the candidate \\"everything you'd want in an up-and- coming young leader: brave and battle-tested, deeply rooted in his community and passionate about bringing change and progress to his long-neglected corner of Missouri.\\" In January 2010, Sowers traveled around all twenty-eight counties in the district in a project dubbed \\"Boots on the Ground.\\" Sowers worked a job in every county, garnering a great deal of local press. Boots on the Ground's success led to a mention from former Governor of Vermont Howard Dean on MSNBC, predicting Sowers \\"is going to knock off, I think, Jo Ann Emerson.\\" In July, Sowers embarked on Boots on the Ground II, again working a job in every county. Sowers was added to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's top races, the \\"Red to Blue\\" program. Sowers raised over $1.5 million in the 2010 cycle. Sowers out raised all of his opponents, including Emerson, two out of the four quarters. Sowers was endorsed by General Wesley Clark and his organization VoteVets, which aims to put more veterans in Congress. He was also endorsed by two Medal of Honor recipients: Retired Colonel Jack H. Jacobs and former U.S. Senator Bob Kerrey. In a profile in mid-April, Politico's Jonathan Martin called Sowers \\"one of the party's most promising recruits.\\" In August, Sowers released his first ad, Combat Bible, which highlighted his military credentials. The ad was met with praise from Politico's Ben Smith, who called the ad \\"How to run against a GOP incumbent in red America this year.\\" On Election Day, Emerson defeated Sowers with 65% of the vote. After his congressional campaign, Sowers worked as the Senior Advisor to the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the nation's first and largest non-profit focused on improving the lives of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans and their families. As Senior Advisor, Sowers represented his generation of veterans, speaking and attending various conferences from Renaissance Weekends, TED Global, Aspen Institute's security forum and the Clinton Global Initiative. = Political positions = During his campaign, Sowers received national attention for his call to end the conventional war in Afghanistan, criticizing the objective of training the Afghanistan National Army and Police. In September 2010, Sowers appeared on Joe Scarborough's Morning Joe and The Ed Show to call for an end to the war in Afghanistan. In October, he was profiled on the front page of the Washington Post. The article sympathized with the idea of “popular indifference” as the defining feature of the Nation’s engagement with the war, acknowledging Sowers uphill battle to get voters to recognize the war as a pressing issue and not just an unpleasant distant news item.  Volunteer service  After his 2010 Congressional campaign Sowers started working in the nonprofit sector with Iraq and Afghanistan War Veterans of America to improve veterans lives and the lives of their families. In 2015 he was elected to the Americans for the Arts Board of Directors for a three-year term. The organization focuses on the advancement of arts and arts education in America. He is a co-creator of the Lincoln Awards a concert for Veterans & The Military Family that recognizes outstanding achievement and excellence in providing opportunities and support to our nation’s veterans and military families. It was nationally broadcast on PBS and hosted by the Kennedy Center. From 2017-2018 he served on the board of the Entrepreneurs’ Organization in the Raleigh Durham chapter, where he is still a current member. EO is the World’s Only Peer-to-peer Network Exclusively for Entrepreneurs, The Entrepreneurs' Organization enables entrepreneurs to learn and grow from each other leading to greater business success and an enriched personal life.  Personal life  Sowers lives in Chapel Hill, North Carolina with his wife, four daughters and dogs. He is an adventure racer and ultramarathoner. He has also an accomplished sommelier, arborist and freestanding handstand training.

The festival was held over three days with Friday night swing, Saturday night orchestral 'Proms in the Park' with fireworks, and Sunday family chill-out. History The festival was organised by local residents Peter and Caroline Hammond. The first event was held in 2001 with one band, and was not planned as an annual event. Organised by the Friends of Stoke Climsland Parish Church, it expanded into a three-day festival. By 2008, the event was attracting over 2,000 people. The festival celebrated its 10th anniversary on 16 - 18 July 2010. It featured a combination of big band music, \\"Proms on the Lawn\\" featuring light orchestra and choir, with a firework finale, and \\"chill out\\" music. Sunday's event tied in with the BBC's \\"Big Lunch\\" campaign, designed to get communities and neighbours talking to each other more by having communal lunches and street parties. After a break in 2011, it returned the following year over the weekend of 15–17 June 2012 to celebrate the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. Despite the festival's award-winning success and popularity for over a decade, 2012 was the last annual Whiteford Festival. The organisers continued to support the local community at Stoke Climsland with other events. This secular festival helped raise money for the physical (non-religious) maintenance and repair of the local Parish Church at Stoke Climsland and other charities including the Royal Marines Charitable Trust.

Background Freedman was born and raised in New Jersey. His music makes heavy use of the piano, which has led to regular comparisons with chanteuse Tori Amos. Similar to Amos, Freedman was a child piano prodigy and won statewide competitions while growing up. Freedman has said that repeated bouts of depression during his adolescence inspired him to write his first songs. He cites Joni Mitchell, Cat Stevens, Paula Cole, and Beethoven as major influences. Freedman's music blends pop and folk influences with a confessional lyrical style. His hallmark rapid staccato style is classically influenced (audio sample below). Freedman's first public performance was at the Butterfield Beanery in New Brunswick, NJ on April 26, 1996. He went on to formally study piano at Ithaca College in Ithaca, NY.Gustavo Rivas, The Ithacan, Ithaca College, http://www.ithaca.edu/ithacan/articles/9904/01/accent/freedman.html Freedman has since been based out of Chicago, Boston, Charleston, and San Diego. Music In 1999, Freedman released his first album Swimming After Dark on the independent label Violent Yodel Records. The debut was met with rave reviews, including a feature on Indie-music.com. \\"I've never heard anything like this. It's heartbreaking, passionate, and unabashedly honest. He [Freedman] lives in a beautiful world, even when it's painful, and I'm finding it hard to leave.\\" Following the success of his first album, Freedman released a follow-up album in 2001, Anything Worth Mentioning. His second release strayed from the intimate quality of Swimming After Dark and featured full- band arrangements, including an enigmatic banjo solo during the opening number. Critics hailed Freedman's sophomore release as proof the songwriter was maturing. Billboard Magazine gave Freedman a full page profile, dubbing the young pianist \\"a star-in-waiting.\\"Larry Flick, Billboard Magazine, February 23, 2002 Freedman began nationally touring at that time, performing at colleges, festivals, and coffeehouses across the country. Freedman returned to the studio in 2003 to record a third album, Some Company. Along with 10 new original numbers, the album included a popularly downloaded version of Marc Cohn's Walking in Memphis. Some Company was reminiscent of Freedman's early roots and consisted solely of vocal-piano numbers. Freedman's fan base began to expand about that time, spreading as far as Australia where Freedman toured for three months promoting the album.

In response to fan suggestions, Freedman posted 30 songs on his website where fans voted on which tracks to record. In 2005, the aptly titled Judge a Book was released featuring the top- voted tracks. Collaborations appeared for the first time including the controversial \\"Soldiers of Christ\\" by \\"I Kissed a Girl\\"'s Jill Sobule (who also sings on the track). A spin on The Magnetic Fields' \\"Papa Was a Rodeo\\" was recorded with singer-songwriter Mark Weigle, and indie singer-songwriter Edie Carey lent vocals to the pop-tinged \\"Good Morning Baby\\". A bonus track of The Cranberries' \\"Zombie\\", recorded on an old church organ in Charleston, SC, also appeared on the cover album. \\"Zombie\\" was subsequently released as a single in 2009,https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/zombie-the-cranberries- cover/id307748971 and featured in the 2016 finale of the popular Italian talent show, Amici di Maria De Filippi.http://www.wittytv.it/amici/macbeth- gabriele-la-finale/ Freedman disappeared from the music scene between 2006–2010 in order to earn his Doctor of Philosophy in Language and Communicative Disorders from San Diego State University and the University of California, San Diego.

The album was a collection of deeply personal songs including the final track \\"Stay\\", which bared Freedman's religious side for the first time.

He was succeeded briefly by Solomon Goldelman, then in January 1919 by Abraham Revutzky of Poale Zion. In October 1918 he was amongst the founders of an important Yiddish publishing house Folks-Farlag, initiated by intellectuals affiliated to the Folkspartei, like himself. In 1920, he emigrated to Germany, where he continued searching for places to build a Jewish homeland. From 1923 to 1925 he traveled around the Jewish settlements in South America, about which he wrote a book, Einwanderung in di Yiddish Ishuwim in Dorem America (Immigration to the Jewish Communities of South America, 1926). In 1925 he moved to Riga, where he published the daily Yiddish newspapers Dos Folk and Freemorgn. By the end of 1925 he had become disillusioned with Territorialism and switched to Zionism, immigrating to Eretz Yisrael.

It is a sequel to Dennis the Menace and Dennis the Menace Strikes Again. The plot is based on Charles Dickens's 1843 novella A Christmas Carol. Composer Peter Allen was nominated for a Leo Award for his score for the film. None of the cast from the first or second film appear in this film. Plot Dennis attempts to inject his grinchy neighbor, Mr. Wilson, with the holiday spirit, but causes his usual array of damage along the way. Dennis also hopes with his good deeds, that he will receive a new bicycle for Christmas. However, because of all of his accidents, Mr. Wilson threatens Dennis' parents with lawsuits and forces them to pay for damages, as well as losing his temper to Dennis, by telling him there is no such thing as Santa Claus. The Angels of Christmas Past, Present, and Future intervene to help save Christmas for the Mitchell and Wilson families. The Angel takes Mr. Wilson to his childhood home in the 1950s, where he runs to his bathtub to put his neighbor's model boats which he thinks are in the wrong place, when the nozzle breaks and floods the room. Mr. Wilson was like Dennis himself when he was a child. The Angel then takes him back to the present, and Mr. Wilson sees Dennis's parents do not have enough money for presents as a result of having to hand over so much money to the Wilsons in order to fix the damage caused by Dennis's behavior. They will have to sell the house to pay off Mr. Wilson's damage and Dennis lost hope in Christmas since he won't get the bike and calls himself a menace since he let Mr. Wilson down. He also notices how depressed his wife is because she really wants to celebrate Christmas, but due to her husband's hatred for the holidays they are unable to; he soon realizes he must put an end to it. Finally, the Angel takes him to the future, where it is bleak and the atmosphere requires SPF 800 sunscreen because of global warming since 2019. His house is abandoned since Dennis and the Mitchells aren't here and after his wife died, he died alone, and Dennis is shown to be old, lonely, childless, friendless and having a dislike of Christmas (and, in the process, repeating what Mr. Wilson said to him — and other kids — about Christmas). Dennis grew up to be Mr. Wilson and twice as bad hating Christmas as he is. Mr. Wilson realizes that what he had said was not true. It is the final epiphany that convinces Mr. Wilson to change his outlook on Christmas and makes him vow to celebrate Christmas with others. Mr. Wilson then wakes up to find himself back in the present, and spreads his Christmas joy around the neighborhood; Dennis wakes up the next morning with a tree loaded with gifts. Mr. Wilson helps Dennis's parents with finances, forget about the debt and knew a couple of people to repair his house and talks to Dennis and cheers him up with holiday joy (while also apologizing to him for what he had said) the bike he always he wanted. Mr. Wilson and his wife have a big Christmas tree in their living room and his childhood fishing pole was purchased online. Dennis races with the other kids on his new bicycle, and loses. The film ends with the Angel sitting on a roof reflecting on how much he loves happy endings before popping back to the North Pole, and the kids riding their bikes before Dennis accidentally crashes into Mr. Wilson, ending the film.

Jalalian's sentence was later reduced to life imprisonment. Human rights organizations have condemned Jalalian's verdict, torture, conditions of incarceration and the inattention to her medical care.United for Iran: Zeynab Jalalian  Biography  When Jalalian was ten years old, she ran away from home because her parents would not allow her to go to school.  Arrest  Jalalian was arrested in July 2007 in the Kurdish city of Kermanshah and transferred to the detention center of the Intelligence Ministry. Her trial before the Court of First Instance took place in December 2008; after conducting a summary trial, the Court found Jalalian guilty and sentenced her to death, on charges of being a member of the Party of Free Life of Kurdistan (PJAK), a banned Kurdish group: based on her alleged membership of that Kurdistan political party, she was accused of fighting God (mohareb) and given the death penalty.Opinion No. 1/2016 concerning Zeinab Jalalian (Islamic Republic of Iran)Iranian Judicial Officials Suggest Kurdish Prisoner Will Get Temporary Leave if She Agrees to Televised \\"Confession\\", International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran (February 9, 2016). (The Revolution court in Kermanshah conducted a brief trial, without due diligence and proper legal representation, lasting only a few minutes. Jalalian was ill, due to prison conditions and torture. She did not have any lawyer to defend her. The Court told her: “You are a God's enemy and you have to be hanged very soon”.) Jalalian has denied the charges. Her death sentence was confirmed by the Iranian Supreme Court in November 2009. On June 28, 2010, her family stated that in her last phone call, \\"which was a month ago, Zeynab has mentioned that she is held in Evin Prison”. Since that time, her family or her lawyers had not been able to receive any further information, the authorities responding that her file had been lost. In an interview with the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, published on July 1, 2010, Iranian lawyer Khalil Bahramian talks about him being refused to visit Ms Jalalian in prison. In 2010, after being incarcerated into section 209 of the Evin prison for five months, and after a meeting with Tehran Public Prosecutor, Jalalian was transferred back to Kermanshah prison. The Supreme Court of Iran has reduced Jalalian's sentence to life imprisonment. In December 2011, Ms. Jalalian contacted her lawyer to inform him that, according to prison authorities, her sentence had been reduced to life imprisonment. In Kermanshah prison, Zeynab Jalalian was verbally informed by judicial authorities that her death sentence had been commuted to imprisonment.  Denied treatment  In April 2016, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (UN Human Rights Working Group on Arbitrary Detention) issued an official request to the Islamic Republic of Iran to release Zeinab Jalalian immediately, as the deprivation of her liberty is arbitrary, being in contravention of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The Working Group also considers that an adequate remedy would be to accord Jalalian an enforceable right to compensation in accordance the ICCPR.Human Rights Council: Opinion No. 1/2016 concerning Zeinab Jalalian (Islamic Republic of Iran) Indeed, Jalalian was being subjected to torture by the Iranian authorities and was denied access to treatments and specialized medical care despite her deteriorating health in Khoy prison, West Azerbaijan Province. She has several medical conditions, including a heart problem and a severe dental infection.  Hunger Strike  Zeinab Jalalian, along with nine prisoners of ordinary offences, went on hunger strike in protest to being deprived of weekly visits and basic prison facilities on August 4, 2018. The strike ended the day after with no result.

James Graham House is a historic log cabin located on West Virginia Route 3 in Lowell, West Virginia. It was built in 1770 as a home for Col. James Graham, the first settler of Lowell, and his family. It was later the site of an Indian attack on the Graham family in 1777. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 16, 1976. The Graham House is the oldest multi-story log cabin in West Virginia. It is currently operating as a museum. History James Graham and his family built the cabin in 1770 after migrating to the area from elsewhere in Virginia. As the Grahams were the first permanent settlers in the region, the Graham House became the first established home in what is now Summers County. The log house, with a exterior, was significantly larger than other pioneer cabins of the period. The Graham family settled into a life of farming in the home upon its completion. In 1777, Indians attacked the Graham House, killing Col. Graham's son John, a neighbor of the Grahams named McDonald, and a young slave boy as well as kidnapping Col. Graham's daughter Elizabeth. The family did not successfully ransom Elizabeth until 1785. The Graham House remained in the Graham family until 1860. After 1860, several other families inhabited the cabin, including Col. Wilson Lively's family and Mr. and Mrs. Lewis E. Barickman. The last residents of the house (from 1976 - 1986) were Eileen and Bill Muhly, Jr. and their six children. The youngest two, twins Mary Elizabeth and James Arthur Bertram were born while the family resided there. The house is currently owned by the Graham House Preservation Society and operated as a museum. Description The Graham House is notable as being a particularly large house compared to other log cabins of the period. The exterior of the house measures by , and the cabin consists of two floors and an attic, including a ceiling. The house is built of poplar, walnut, and oak logs, with stones used as additional supports. Large stone chimneys are located at either end of the house. The house was likely built with a single door and no windows, but an additional door and several windows were added at a later date. The first floor consists of a single room, and at one point was split into three rooms; the second floor has three rooms. The house's original outbuildings were eventually replaced by additions on the north side of the house, the latest of which was built in the 1970s and includes bathing and kitchen areas. Graham House in 2017 Museum The Graham House is currently operated as a private museum, with tours given during summer months on weekends. The house is also used as a venue for community events such as dinners, festivals, and reunions. On the same property as the Graham House lies the Saunders One Room School House Museum. The school house, while not an original school building, allows visitors to see an example of a one room school house. The property also houses a barn which contains many pieces of old farm equipment.

Petlin), a Siberian Cossack,Purchas, p. 274Demidova & Myasnikov (1966) was the first Russian to have reached China on an official mission (1618-1619). His expedition may have been the second European expedition to reach China from the west by an overland route (after that of Bento de Góis) since the fall of the Yuan Dynasty. For background, see Russia-China relations. Although sent by the Czar he was not officially an ambassador. The mission was outfitted by the Tobolsk and Tomsk voyevodas. Petlin was originally appointed as translator and scribe under Maksim Trupcheninov, but at the last minute Trupcheninov was unable to go so Petlin became leader. His traveling companion was named Andrei Mundov (Mundoff).Lach & Van Kley (1994), pp. 1756.-1757. Lach & Van Kleyn give the name of the second Cossack as \\"Mundoff\\", but Purchas (p. 272) phonetically transcribes it as \\"Andrushko Madigene\\", which could possibly be \\"Madigin\\" or \\"Motygin\\" in a modern standard transcription. Accompanied by two returning envoys from the Altyn Khan who was one of leader of Western Mongolia, Petlin and Mundov left Tomsk on 9 May 1618 and went south up the Ob River, crossed the Abakan Range, went south to Tuva and around Lake Ubsa to the court of the Altyn Khan. (This route was rarely used in later times.) From there he traveled east across Mongolia to the Great Wall and reached Peking in late August. He was not allowed to see the Wanli Emperor because he did not bring proper tribute. He returned some time before November 1619. He brought with him a letter in Chinese inviting the Russians to open trade, but no one in Russia was able to read it until 1675. Petlin's report Basil Dymytryshyn, Russia's Conquest of Siberia:A Documentary Record, volume one, document 31 is quite vague. He mentions: the upper Ob; rivers flowing into Lake Ubsa; the local rulers across Mongolia; a Princess Malchikatun who rules the towns of Mongolia and issues permits to cross the Great Wall; the Black Mongols west of the wall and the Yellow Mongols east of it; an 'Iron Tsar' near Bukhara who sends diamonds to China (probably, a reference to the Kashgarian jade tribute trade); the Great Wall (which he thinks runs from the Pacific to Bukhara); several Chinese cities on the way to Peking; Peking; and an 'Ob River' which he seems to think flows from western Mongolia to the Yellow Sea. He mentions lamas, temples with gilded statues, city walls and gates, paved streets and officials who go about with yellow sunshades over their heads. Throughout he emphasizes the remarkable fact that cities are built of stone. An account of Petlin's expedition was translated into English and published in Samuel Purchas' \\"Pilgrims\\" (vol. XIV) (1625); it was apparently well known in the 17th century England: e.g., John Milton is thought to have drawn on it in his description of Mongolia.\\"GEOGRAPHICAL DICTIONARY OF MILTON\\", BY ALLAN H.

Introduced in Saw (2004), he is a police detective investigating a series of crime scenes linked to the same murderer, later revealed to be the Jigsaw Killer, and serves as one of the film's protagonists. Tapp has also made minor appearances and was mentioned in Saw III (2006), Saw IV (2007), and Saw V (2008). He appearead as a playable character in both Saw: The Video Game (2009), in which he was voiced by Earl Alexander, and Dead by Daylight (2016). Appearances =In film= In Saw, David Tapp is a police detective who investigates a series of crime scenes linked to the same murderer. The victims have been placed in to traps that attempt to teach them to appreciate their life, a quality they decidedly lack. The victims who fail these \\"tests\\" have a jigsaw piece cut out of their bodies. This has earned the killer the alias \\"The Jigsaw Killer\\" by newspaper writer Oswald McGillicutty. Saw II later reveals these missing pieces have been intended to show the missing survival instinct of Jigsaw's victims. At one of the crime scenes, Tapp and his partner, Steven Sing, discover a penlight with fingerprints on it. Forensics indicate that the fingerprints belong to Dr. Lawrence Gordon, who is taken to the police station for questioning. Saw V later revealed that Jigsaw accomplice Mark Hoffman had planted this penlight to arise suspicion on Gordon. While a few victims have already been discovered, one victim named Amanda Young manages to survive her test. Lawrence watches while Tapp interrogates Amanda for her testimony. After hearing her testimony, Tapp gives Lawrence a ride home and becomes more suspicious that Lawrence is Jigsaw. Tapp recovers and studies the video tape left at Amanda's trap location and deciphers the location of Jigsaw's lair. Tapp and Sing find Jigsaw in his lair, but fail to arrest him due to Jigsaw non-fatally slashing Tapp's neck and Sing falling victim to one of Jigsaw's traps. Following Sing's death, Tapp becomes unstable and begins to obsess over catching Jigsaw, causing him to be discharged from the police force and to be divorced from his wife. As Jigsaw was able to hide his identity when his lair was raided, Tapp still believes that Lawrence is Jigsaw, and spends much of his time to harass and pester him, unknowing that Lawrence had been abducted and is currently in a trap of his own. This causes him to stake out his home; he uses a video camera to watch it from another apartment. During this, Tapp sees Zep Hindle at the Gordons' house and then hears gunshots coming from the house. Tapp responds and discovers that Alison Gordon and her daughter Diana are being held hostage by Zep. A gunfight ensues, allowing Alison and Diana to escape. Tapp chases Zep to the site of another Jigsaw game, later revealed to be Lawrence's trap. Before discovering the trap site, Zep and Tapp engage in a brief struggle that ends with Zep shooting Tapp in the chest and leaving him to die. In Saw III, David Tapp is seen during the montage of the first three films at the very end of the film. In Saw IV, the scene where Daniel Rigg is watching Jill Tuck's interrogation at The Metropolitan Police Department features a picture of David Tapp. He is briefly seen as Rigg looks through a folder containing pictures of several police officers he has lost. In Saw V, a memorial service is held for the deceased officers from the Jigsaw murders. Tapp's police picture is among the pictures of the deceased officers. Tapp also appears in a flashback, inquiring Dr. Lawrence Gordon about the penlight Mark Hoffman planted. Danny Glover was originally set to make a cameo appearance as David Tapp in Saw V, but could not show up due to scheduling issues. The scene was originally for Tapp to attend Seth Baxter's murder scene, but was changed with Hoffman instead. =In video games=  Saw: The Video Game  In the video game adaptation of Saw (2009), set after the events of the first film, Tapp is revealed to have survived his gunshot wound and is healed back to health by Jigsaw. He is brought to the abandoned Whitehurst asylum where he is placed in the Reverse Bear Trap Amanda Young was in. He quickly escapes after Jigsaw scolds him for his lack of appreciation for his life and the lives of others. Upon escaping, Tapp ventures through the asylum where he faces others during their tests. Some of these tests involve Tapp in numerous ways. Tapp's first test is to save Amanda Young, the woman he interrogated during Saw, unbeknown to him that she had become Jigsaw's secret apprentice. Upon saving her, she stages her kidnapping by another Jigsaw apprentice called Pighead, and Tapp moves to his next test. The second test is for Jennings Foster, a fellow officer of Tapp's who had committed a hit-and- run which he framed an innocent person for. A conflicted Tapp saves Jennings who runs away and blames Tapp for being there. David Tapp as he appears in Saw: The Video Game. Tapp is shown in the Reverse Bear Trap. Tapp's third test is for Melissa Sing, the widow of Tapp's former partner Steven Sing who has since become a neglectful mother to her son. Jigsaw informs her that Tapp had ignored calling for backup or getting a search warrant when searching Jigsaw's lair in the first Saw film, a careless step which was the reason Steven was killed. Believing Tapp could have prevented his partners death, Melissa began to blame him for her misfortunes. Upon Tapp finding and saving her, Melissa leaves Tapp to deal with his other tests. Tapp proceeds to save Oswald McGillicutty, a newspaper writer who coined the alias \\"Jigsaw\\", and begins to accuse Tapp of being Jigsaw. After saving Oswald, Tapp rescues Obi Tate, an arsonist who wanted to be tested by Jigsaw. Tapp then proceeds to save his sixth victim, Jeff Ridenhour, who was in the Drill Trap when Tapp and Sing had raided Jigsaw's lair during the first film. After he survived his first test, Jeff becomes suicidal after Tapp harasses him to discover Jigsaw's identity. This causes Jeff to be placed in his second trap in which Tapp saves him. After saving all of the victims in the asylum, Tapp kills Pighead and proceeds to Jigsaw. He labels Tapp as a murderer for killing Pighead and others in Whitehurst. Tapp finds and chases Jigsaw but finds two doors labeled \\"Truth\\" and \\"Freedom\\". If the player chooses the \\"Freedom\\" door, Tapp escapes and is labeled as a hero, but he kills himself soon afterdue to the stress of not being able to catch Jigsaw. If the player chooses the \\"Truth\\" door, Tapp chases Jigsaw and catches him, but he finds that it was Melissa Sing. A tape recorder informs Tapp that Melissa was assigned by Jigsaw to watch over Tapp's test and that her son would be killed if she did not. Melissa then breaks free from Tapp but is killed by a tripwire trap, similar to the one in which her husband Steven was killed. Burdened by Melissa's death, Tapp becomes insane and is left in a functional asylum where he still believes he is playing Jigsaw's games.  Saw II: Flesh and Blood  Tapp is not featured in the sequel, Saw II: Flesh and Blood, but he is mentioned several times. It is revealed that the \\"Freedom\\" ending of the first game is the canonical one, due to a newspaper mentioning Tapp's escape from Whitehurst and subsequent suicide. Throughout most of the game, players control Tapp's estranged son Michael, who tries to find the cause of his father's death, which leads to him also coming into conflict with Jigsaw. Michael comes across his father's files, detailing events from the Saw film and game. There are also audio tapes made by Tapp both before and after his Whitehurst Asylum tests that can be found throughout the game which detail his investigation of the Jigsaw Killer and his gradually building obsession, beginning with the discovery of Cecil Adams' body. It is also revealed that Tapp felt guilty for killing Pighead in the first game, not knowing if the person in the costume had a family or if he was forced to work for Jigsaw.  Dead by Daylight  David Tapp is the survivor featured in \\"The Saw Chapter\\" downloadable content for the video game Dead by Daylight. Characterization Initially, Tapp is introduced in Saw as a typical police figure. When investigating the Jigsaw murders, Tapp begins to overlook police procedures and protocols in order to apprehend Jigsaw. This eventually gets his partner murdered and his own throat slashed. Tapp then becomes mentally unstable and develops an extreme obsession with Jigsaw to avenge his partner. This evolution in Tapp's character eventually becomes his tragic flaw that leads to many misfortunes. The immediate consequences for this are his divorce from his wife and his discharge from the police force. UGO described Tapp as \\"A good man who was driven mad by evil circumstances ...\\" and noted the choice he had between saving victims and catching Jigsaw. =Physical appearance= Tapp is shown to be an older male in his mid-50s, around 6 feet tall (1.83 m), during the first film's timeline. In contrast to many horror and action games, Tapp is not portrayed as superhuman or physically superior in any way. Being older, he is less fit and therefore inferior in combat situations. This is shown in Saw when Tapp loses a fistfight to Zep Hindle, which results in Tapp being shot in the chest. In Saw: The Video Game, Tapp has a hard time wielding heavy weapons and is usually slower in attacking than his opponents. Tapp's most distinguishing attribute, his thickly scarred neck, was acquired early in Saw; his scars have made his voice hoarse. Similar to other detectives in the Saw franchise, Tapp is seen wearing civilian clothing while on the police force; the exception is Saw V which shows a photograph of him in his uniform. Reviewer Byron Hinson felt that Tapp's rendition in the Saw: The Video Game looked nothing like Danny Glover's Tapp from the film. He said that Tapp looked many years younger but partially blamed this on poor character textures and drawings. MobyGames felt that while Earl Alexander did well at voicing Tapp for the game, he felt he sounded nothing like Danny Glover, which detracted from the game experience and pointed out the contradiction of Tapp's clear voice in the game despite his scarred throat. The reviewer went as far as to jokingly compare Earl Alexander's voice as being closer to Samuel L. Jackson's than Danny Glover's. Danny Glover During an interview with Spike, Danny Glover commented on his character, David Tapp, and his obsession, saying, \\"What happens in the process of trying to find him, I'm overcome because of this obsession I have. I mean most police detectives at least provide you with the image that they know everything, and they're so heady to some extents, so above the others that we can figure this stuff out. But the process of figuring this stuff out, as I come closer to this, I come closer to something else that's happening and maybe I come closer to my own fear to some extent. And certainly my worst fears come to bear when I'm shot, and wounded, and my partner is killed. Then there's another level of obsession that now translates itself into this film or becomes apparent in this film. And the obsession that's connected with anger and guilt, to some extent, along with fear is pretty potent in this sense. And all of that brings about a kind of psychological breakdown, a psychotic breakdown in terms of this character. I think the obsession in some sense drives us, you know? It's obsession that drives you in a different way that's not fulfilled or completed in some way. It certainly leaves a whole 'nother kind of space there that is a very dangerous space for Tapp, the police man. Certainly coupled with the fact that my partner is lost because of essentially my own inadequacy because of me. That transforms the situation.\\" In the same interview, Glover commented on his attraction to the film and the prospect of playing Tapp in Saw, stating, \\"I saw 10-12 minutes of video of the first scene here and I was really impressed with it. I was impressed by the way of the shot, the way the camera moved, and the kind of subtlety and the language of the story. Sometimes you look at a story and you're looking at the language of the story and how does the person use language, you know? and I like all of that how does the director or the filmmaker use language in order to shape or tell the story, and I like that.\\" References External links * David Tapp at Giant Bomb Fictional African-American people Fictional American police detectives Film characters introduced in 2004 Saw (franchise) characters Male horror film characters ","title":"David Tapp"},{"id":"25052855","text":"Jordan's Chapel is a historic Methodist chapel located near Pipestem, Summers County, West Virginia.

Cooke (2 August 1939 - 28 March 2016) was an American historian, author, academic and soldier. He is known for his studies of the American armed forces during World War I. Early life Born at St. Mary’s Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland on August 2, 1939, and baptized into the Christian Faith at Christ Lutheran Church in York, Pennsylvania, a month later. He resided in Baltimore until the family moved to Brooklyn Park. In 1956, his junior year of high school, he joined the US Army Reserves. He wrote in his high school year book in 1957 that he wanted to be a “college history teacher.”His love of history began in the time he spent with his family in York. Charles Wise, a concert violinist, served in France in World War I as an infantry soldier. His Great-Grandmother Mina Belle Wise went West to Montana to do her Christian duty to teach for a year, and returned with stories of the “cowboys and the Indians.” His Great-Aunt Mary Utz was a strong Christian, advocating Victorian virtues. Their impact was great and long-lasting. While in York he met one Union Civil War veteran, and also an old lady who saw Pickett’s Charge at Gettysburg in 1863. Upon graduation from Brooklyn Park High School in 1957, Cooke tried his hand at various jobs, since college funds were non-existent. He then joined the US Regular Army, and after training in the United States he was assigned to the US Army General Depot at Ingrandes-sur-Vienne, France. In September 1960, he met a Miss Josephine Alexander of Vicksburg, Mississippi, who had just arrived on post as a Department of the Army Civilian (DAC) Service Club Hostess. On October 6, 1961, they were married, first in the Office of the Mayor of Ingrandes (as required by French law), and then in a ceremony in the post chapel. In 1962, they returned to the United States. Cooke entered Mississippi College, Clinton, MS, in 1962, earning a BA in 1965 and MA in 1966. He was accepted in the PhD program at the University of Georgia, and graduated in the summer of 1969. While at Georgia he studied under Professor Alf Andrew Heggoy and developed a speciality in Arab, Islamic North Africa, which was coupled with a field in Modern European History. Cooke’s dissertation Eugene Etienne and the New French Imperialism required study and research in Paris, France, made possible by a French study grant. During the last few months of his PhD studies he had several job offers and accepted the post of Assistant Professor of History at the University of Mississippi in Oxford, where his wife had received her BA 1959. Early writing career Being a staunch advocate for the concept that a university professor had the obligation to research and publish as well as teach, he began by having articles accepted in the journals The Muslim World, African Studies Review, African Quarterly (New Delhi, India), The Indian Political Science Review, Military Affairs, and others. His first book, New French Imperialism: The Third Republic and Colonial Expansion (1973) and his second book, France, 1789 - 1962 (1975) were published in England by David and Charles Ltd. A third book was a collaborative effort, Through Foreign Eyes: Westerners View North Africa (1982). At that time Cooke, Alf Heggoy, Claude Sturgill (University of Florida) and others founded The French Colonial Historical Society. United States Army service Still feeling a strong attachment to the military, Cooke sought a commission in the United States Army and was commissioned a second lieutenant in military intelligence as a strategic analyst. He began his officer’s service, however, as an armored cavalry platoon leader in A Troop, 108th Armored Cavalry of the Mississippi Army National Guard. He commanded B Troop of the 108th for six years. In the 1980s he joined the Intelligence Section of the 155th Armored Brigade of the Mississippi Army National Guard, and commanded that section until he was promoted to major and became the executive officer of the 2nd Battalion, 198th Armor Regiment, an M1 tank battalion. He returned to the headquarters of the 155th Brigade, took command of the Readiness Section and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. In August 1990, with Desert Shield in progress in Saudi Arabia, the Army called up every Arabic-speaking officer it could find. Cooke, a lieutenant colonel with intelligence experience, was near the head of the list. He left the National Guard for a return to the Regular Army and was assigned to the G2 (Intelligence), XVIII Airborne Corps. He was posted as the corps liaison officer for intelligence to The Saudi Eastern Province Area Command, with authority extending to the Saudi–Kuwaiti border. In January the XVIII Airborne Corps shifted its area of operations west. Cooke, a fluent French speaker, was assigned as the Corps liaison officer for intelligence with the French Division Daguet, as part of Operation Daguet. During Desert Storm Cooke and the division saw heavy combat, and at the end of the war they occupied the town of As Salman, Iraq. For his combat service Cooke was awarded the Bronze Star Medal. Post-service published works After his service with the XVIIIth Airborne Corps and the Division Daguet, Cooke returned to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, to be demobilized. Returning to the University of Mississippi, he began to write his memoirs of the Persian Gulf War, which was published by Praeger Publishing under the title of 100 Hundred Miles From Baghdad: With the French in Desert Storm (1993) This book began a long association with Praeger Publishing. Prior to the Gulf War, Cooke’s scholarly work underwent a transition. While doing research in Paris on the French administration of Morocco, he worked with the papers of General Henri Gouraud, who served in Morocco and on the Western Front during World War I. The general continually referred to \\"his\\" Americans under his command during the war. This happened in spite of General John Pershing's resistance to the merging of American troops with French or British during the war. On his return, Cooke obtained the letters and papers of a soldier who served in the 168th Infantry Regiment of the famed 42nd Infantry Division, commonly known as the Rainbow Division. That division was under General Gouraud's command during the heavy fighting during the summer of 1918. After research in Washington, numerous state archives, and at the Army War College at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, Cooke completed The Rainbow Division in the Great War, 1917 - 1919, released by Praeger in 1994. This book was followed by The U.S. Air Service in the Great War, 1917 - 1919 (1996), Pershing and His Generals: Command and Staff in the AEF (1997), and The All-Americans at War: The 82nd Division in the Great War (1999). A year after his return from Desert Storm to the University, Cooke was invited to be a Visiting Professor of History at the U.S. Air Force’s Air War College at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama. While there he began research on the founding fathers of American air power during World War I. This research led to the publication in 2002 of a biography, Billy Mitchell (Lynne Rienner Press). At the same time Cooke came in contact with British historians who had a major scholarly interest in the Great War. This association with the British scholars, Peter Liddle, Hugh Cecil, and Ian Whitehead, resulted in the publication of a number of co-authored books. Cooke contributed chapters to Facing Armageddon (Pen and Sword, 1996), and At the Eleventh Hour (Penn and Sword, 1998). In 2000 Cooke contributed two chapters to the two-volume The Great World War, 1914 - 1945 (HarperCollins). While working with British historians, Cooke continued a relation with the military historian David Zabecki. Cooke wrote eleven entries for Zabecki’s World War II in Europe: An Encyclopedia (Garland, 1999) and contributed a chapter entitled “James Guthrie Harbord: Pershing’s Chief of Staff” in Zabecki’s two-volume Chief of Staff (Naval Institute Press, 2008). Continuing this growing interest in World War II, Cooke became associated with The Second World War Experience Centre in Horsforth, Leeds, West Yorkshire, and published five articles in the journal Everyone’s War. He maintains a close working relationship with the Centre, focusing on the building of the American archival portion. Cooke edited a reprinting of the classic World War I memoir by Martin Hogan, The Shamrock Battalion in the Great War (1919) (University of Missouri Press, 2007). In 2009, his book, Chewing Gum, Candy Bars, and Beer: The Army PX in World War II (University of Missouri Press) was published. In 1995, Cooke retired from the Mississippi Army National Guard and was placed on the retired list with the rank of brigadier general. In 1999 he retired from the University of Mississippi. Over the years he received honors: Fellow, The Royal Historical Society; Chevalier, Ordre des Palmes Académiques (France); and Fellow, The Second World War Experience Centre. He remains a member of the Division Daguet veterans association in France and a member of the Oxford post of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Upon retiring from the National Guard with 34 years of service he was decorated with the Meritorious Service Medal and the Magnolia Cross of the state of Mississippi. In retirement, gardening, scholarly research, and veterans’ affairs occupied his time. The Cookes have four grown children: Victoria Ellen Cooke, James Alexander Cooke, Josephine Estelle (Josie) Cooke, and John Harrell Cooke. He died on 6 March 2016 at Baptist Memorial Hospital in Oxford, Mississippi.Morgan, Walker. (28 March 2016). History Professor Emeritus James J. Cooke. The Daily Mississippian. Oxford, Mississippi.

Overview The ministry was organized to address the ceremonial aspects of the Imperial year, to manage the ceremonial nature of formal relations with China, Korea, and other nations, and to oversee the maintenance of Imperial tombs and mausoleums. The ceremonies of the Imperial Household evolved over time. The ambit of the Ministry's activities encompasses, for example: * maintenance of the roster of names of officialsKawakami, citing Ito Hirobumi, Commentaries on the Japanese Constitution, p. 87 (1889). * oversight of the succession and marriage of officials of and above the fifth grade of rank * oversight of formalities relating to deaths, funerals and the granting of posthumous rank * management of the memorial activities which honor the anniversaries of the demise of a former Emperor * monitoring and recording of the names of all the former Emperors, so that none of those names shall be used by any of the succeeding Emperors nor by any subject * adjudication of disputes about the order of precedence of the various families * supervision of all matters relating to the music * registration of names of Buddhistic temples, priests and nuns * reception and entertainment of foreigners and managing to their presentation to the Emperor * maintenance of the imperial sepulchers (misasagi) and royal burial mounds (kofun), including oversight of those in attendance upon them. This ministry was also responsible for rules for noble families above the fifth rank.Nussbaum, Louis Frédéric et al.

Klokocka was a signatory to the Charter 77 manifesto, which criticized the Czechoslovakian Communist government for not implementing basic human rights provisions. Born in Prague in 1929, Klokocka graduated from the Faculty of Law at Charles University in Prague. He worked as a lecturer following his graduation from Charles University. In the spring of 1968, Klokocka became a deputy in the Czech National Council, the Czech lower house within Czechoslovakia during the height of the Prague Spring reform period. He also became the dean of the Faculty of Law in Brno, where he drafted new election laws for Czechoslovakia. However, in August 1968 Soviet and other Warsaw Pact forces invaded Czechoslovakia and crushed the liberalization movement. Klokocka was removed from public office and his academic positions at the university. Klokocka took a job with an insurance company following his removal. However, he was fired from the company once he joined with other Czechoslovakian professionals and dissidents to sign the Charter 77 manifesto. Under threat of political persecution, Klokocka fled the country and settled in exile in Munich, West Germany. He was able to obtain a position on the faculty of the University of Munich. He returned from exile to Czechoslovakia in 1990, following the collapse of the Communist Czechoslovakian government in November 1989 during the Velvet Revolution. Following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, Klokočka worked for the Constitutional Court for ten years, from 1993 until 2003. The focus of much of his work dealt with resolving disputes between Czech political parties and election legislation. Klokočka wrote a number of books and articles after his departure from the Constitutional Court in 1993. He received an honorary doctorate from Masaryk University. Vladimír Klokočka died on 19 October 2009 at the age of 80.

The son of English and Scottish immigrants, Beard's artistic interest and recognition of his capability took no time to blossom. It was after the Beard family's relocation to Ohio that he began the serious pursuit of honing his artistic capabilities. Ohio Beard began with a wide variety of painting techniques such as watercolor, acrylic, and pastel. It was in Painesville, Ohio that Beard studied under Jarvis Frary Hanks. His preferred genre of art was portrait painting; Henry Clay, John Quincy Adams, and Don Quixote are just a few of the figures he chose to depict. New York In 1846, at the age of 32, Beard returned to New York in order to get his work noticed. Two years later, his work paid off, as he was inducted into the National Academy of Design. In 1870 he decided to make New York his permanent home. It was in New York City that he began his series of representations of dogs and cats that he is known for.

This quartet earned Carter his second Pulitzer Prize in Music in 1973. Construction The quartet is divided into a pair of duos, Duo I made up of the first violin and the cello, and Duo II made up of the second violin and viola. The two duos play in their own overlapping movements: distinct tempos, articulation, and material, neither coinciding with the other. The first duo is instructed to play rubato throughout its four movements, while the second plays in strict time in six movements. In addition, each movement is assigned a characteristic interval. The ten movements are not played continuously, but rather are fragmented and recombined, producing a total of 24 possible pairings of movements between the duos, as well as a solo statement of each movement. An additional coda brings the total number of sections to 35 . The duos rarely synchronize and frequently clash in complex polyrhythms and dissonances. Each duo uses a distinct interval class, dynamic range, phrasing, and bowing techniques per movement. The movements are : Duo I: Duo II: #Maestoso (perfect fifth) #Grazioso (minor seventh) #Pizzicato giusto, mechanico (tritone) #Scorrevole (minor second) #Largo tranquillo (major third) #Appassionato (major 6th) Carter intended to achieve the effect of two distinct ensemble groups playing two pieces at once, clashing in sound. However, he stressed the importance of observing the combinations of sound between the two sound sources.

A solar eclipse is an astronomical phenomenon that occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is larger than the Sun's, blocking all direct sunlight, turning day into darkness. Totality occurs in a narrow path across Earth's surface, with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide. Occurring only 18 hours and 35 minutes after perigee (Perigee on February 25, 1979 at 22:19 UTC), the Moon's apparent diameter was larger. The central shadow of the moon passed through the American states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana (where totality covered almost the entire state), and North Dakota, the Canadian provinces Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec, the Northwest Territories of Canada (the portion that is now Nunavut), and Greenland.

She described her impressions of the eclipse in an essay, \\"Total Eclipse,\\" first published in the magazine Antaeus and then in her collection, Teaching a Stone to Talk (1982). It was later selected for inclusion in The Best American Essays of the [20th] Century (2000). Dillard describes a nearly overwhelming emotional experience, as suggested in this quotation: \\"I pray you will never see anything more awful in the sky.\\" Describing the reactions of other onlookers, she relates \\"I heard screams.\\" The 1979 eclipse was also referenced in the opening pages of Douglas Coupland's novel, Generation X.

The case stands for the proposition that a provincial administrative actor granted the power to determine questions of law may adjudicate matters within federal legislative competence, including s. 35 aboriginal rights matters. Facts The B.C. Ministry of Forestry seized four logs in the possession of Paul, a registered Indian, who planned to use the wood to build a deck on his home. Paul asserted that he had an aboriginal right to cut timber for house modification and, therefore, the relevant provision of the Forest Practices Code did not apply to him. Timothy P. Leadem, Q.C., and Kathryn Kickbush, represented the appellants, M. Hugh G. Braker, Q.C., and Robert C. Freedman represented the respondent. Murray Rankin and Mark G. Underhill represented the intervener, the Forest Appeals Commission. Judicial History The District Manager agreed that Paul had contravened section 96 of the Forest Practices Code. Paul appealed to the Administrative Review Panel, which concurred with the District Manager. Paul then appealed to the Forest Appeals Commission. When the Forest Appeals Commission found that it possessed the jurisdiction to assess Paul's aboriginal rights claim, Paul moved for an order of certiorari under the BC Judicial Review Procedure Act quashing this preliminary decision of the commission. Paul argued that only the courts should be able to hear and assess his aboriginal rights claim. The Supreme Court of British Columbia ruled that it was within the power of the Forest Appeals Commission to rule on Paul's aboriginal rights claim. Paul then appealed to the British Columbia Court of Appeal. The Court ruled that the BC Legislature was unable to give the commission the power to rule on Paul's aboriginal rights claim by reason of s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867, which gives the federal Parliament exclusive jurisdiction to regulate with respect to \\"Indians, and Land reserved for the Indians.\\" The case was then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.Paul v. British Columbia (Forest Appeals Commission), 2003 SCC 55, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 585, para. 3. Reasons of the court =Can the Province empower the Commission to hear and determine Section 35 questions?= Paul argued that the ss. 130 to 141 of the BC Forest Practices Code are ultra vires because they trench upon the core of Indianness, as protected by s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867. Specifically, counsel for Paul argued that these sections of the act, which provide that the Commission may rule on matters of law, including aboriginal rights (as argued subsequently), are ultra vires by operation of interjurisdictional immunity. This doctrine holds that \\"where the general language of a provincial statute can be read to trench upon exclusive federal power in its application specific factual contexts, the statute must be read down so as not to apply to those situations\\".Paul v. British Columbia (Forest Appeals Commission), 2003 SCC 55, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 585, para. 15. The court considered this argument, but rejected it. The reason why they rejected the argument in this case was that the statute in question merely allowed the provincial Commission to take cognizances of existing constitutional rights, not to alter or supplant those rights.Paul v. British Columbia (Forest Appeals Commission), 2003 SCC 55, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 585, para. 19. The court held that a provincial board may adjudicate matters within federal legislative competence. In coming to this conclusion the court turned to a long line of authorities, including Ontario (Attorney General) v. Pembina Exploration Canada Ltd., which have held that provincially constituted courts can adjudicate matters of exclusive federal jurisdiction, such as Admiralty law.Paul v. British Columbia (Forest Appeals Commission), 2003 SCC 55, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 585, para. 21. =Did the Province empower the Commission to hear and determine Section 35 questions?= The court finds that any tribunal that has the power to rule on matters of law implicitly has the power to rule on Constitutional matters, including s. 35 aboriginal rights matters. The court canvasses arguments that aboriginal rights are somehow different from other constitutional rights, either in their complexity, state of flux, or precedential import, but rejected all such proposals as not providing a workable principled distinction between areas that are generally agreed to be within the competence of inferior tribunals (e.g. the factual determination that a person is an Indian) and those that would putatively not be within the tribunal's jurisdiction.Paul v. British Columbia (Forest Appeals Commission), 2003 SCC 55, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 585, para. 38.

Plot Set mostly in a nursing home, 70-something Hannah is kept separate from her lifelong friend and lover Rachel, who is not expected to emerge from her coma. The nurses follow the orders of Rachel's daughter Marge, who claims her mother would be upset by a visit from Hannah. While Hannah's heart is breaking at the thought of not being able to say goodbye, her mind is full of memories of their life together, and she is frequently visited by a younger, spirit Rachel. Hannah sees, hears, and experiences her, but to anyone else, Hannah appears to be talking to herself. Frustrated by feeling like a prisoner, Hannah grumbles, pleads to see Rachel, and writes in her journal. The backstory gradually emerges. Hannah transitioned easily from tomboy to openly gay while Rachel gave in to societal expectations, married, raised twins, and kept one foot in the closet most of her life, even though everyone knew about her relationship with Hannah. Rachel never left Michigan, but Hannah spent time in Alaska, South America, and during WWII, stationed in New Mexico as a WAC. She had affairs with other women in her travels and they remained good friends, but Rachel always was her true love. There are many flashbacks that show Hannah and Rachel in many aspects of their relationship: being in love, making love, and arguing. In the nursing home, Hannah deals with the annoying but well-meaning staff members, a bewildered resident, a nasty evangelist, and an equally nasty Marge. The arrival of 21-year-old Greta serves as a catalyst to get Hannah out of bed and into Rachel's room. Greta poses as a random student doing an interview for class, but turns out to be Rachel's biological great-granddaughter, whom Hannah had only met as a young child. Greta has a complicated relationship with her grandmother, Marge, who has never truly accepted Hannah as any sort of important mother figure. Greta, a young lesbian, is fully committed to the rights of Hannah and Rachel, and schemes to bring the family together. In an emotional final scene, Rachel lays comatose, while Hannah, Marge and Greta hash out their differences. Together, they say goodbye to Rachel, and lovingly set her free.

Claudia Allen is a playwright-in-residence at Victory Gardens Theater in Chicago. A hallmark of Allen's plays is the portrayal of strong, compassionate women. Author's note: “Few plays are written about elderly lesbians. Fewer plays deal with their extreme vulnerability in a system that doesn’t recognize our rights. I wanted to deal with those issues while also creating a love story about two women who loved each other for decades despite a few flaws and more than a few differences.” Direction Wendy Jo Carlton is a filmmaker, writer, and photographer with a background in radio production, teaching, and media activism. Her award-winning narrative and experimental short films have screened internationally, including the American Film Institute, Sundance, and many other festivals. In addition to founding a media literacy program for teen girls called Chicks Make Flicks, Carlton works as a field producer for Sirius Radio and PBS Television. Production Hannah Free was filmed in the historic Prairie Avenue District of Chicago. The Keith House was the main shooting location. The film's art department transformed rooms of the house into all the necessary sets, like the nursing home, Alaska shed, and various living spaces.

The only C35 class left in existence, and is operational. The class is commonly referred to as Nannies or Naughty Nannies due to their pre-1924 class designation of NN. Construction 3526 was completed by the New South Wales Government Railways' Eveleigh Railway Workshops in March 1917. In service On entering service as one of the 35 members of the NN Class, it was allocated road number 1314, being renumbered in 1924. In the early 1930s, it was one of three C35s painted Oxford blue to operate the Caves Express. Throughout its service life, it received the various modifications made to the class, and was rebuilt with new frames and cab in July 1940 when the class suffered from frame cracking. After its rebuild, 3526 received a lined green paint scheme. In 1964, 3526 received a Commonwealth Engineering built tender from a scrapped standard goods locomotive to increase its coal and water capacity. Demise and Preservation 3526 was withdrawn from service in 1967 and retained for preservation, being placed in the custody of the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum where it remained operational until 1974.

The previous deep blue livery was replaced by unlined black to reflect the locomotive's appearance in later years of its service life. As noted above, 3526 did not carry Caves Express colours in regular service in its current, rebuilt form with new frames and cab: in this form it carried first lined green and then unlined black.

The music and the record are primarily credited to Lord. It was taped at a concert in Munich, (West) Germany on 1 June 1974 and the music is a mix between progressive rock and orchestral late romantic/modernist styles. The piece on the first side, \\"Continuo on B-A-C-H\\" is a loose attempt to build on the unfinished triple fugue that closed Johann Sebastian Bach's \\"Art of the Fugue\\". The second side of the LP is a three-part composition called \\"Window\\". In the liner notes of the LP album Lord makes a comparison between the rhapsodic structure here and the renga tradition of chain composition of poetry in medieval Japan. The music of the middle section was lifted from Lord's earlier crossover effort Gemini Suite (1971). Ray Fenwick, Tony Ashton, David Coverdale, Glenn Hughes and Lord himself perform as soloists along with the Munich Chamber Opera Orchestra conducted by Schoener.

One civilian survived the attack with serious wounds. After a few weeks, Serb paramilitary forces perpetrated another massacre, killing another 3 Croats. In total, 32 residents of Joševica out of 133 that had lived in Joševica (census 1991) were killed.

It is the only genus in the family Dendronucleatidae. This genus contains three species that are distributed globally, being collected in North America and Asia. The distinguishing features of this genus among Archiacanthocephalans is the presence of randomly distributed dendritically branched giant hypodermic nuclei. Dendronucleata parasitize freshwater fish and a salamander by attaching themselves in the intestines using their hook covered proboscis and adhesives secreted from cement glands. Taxonomy and Description The general appearance, shape of proboscis and number and arrangement of proboscis hooks of the Dendronucleatidae are similar to members of Neoechinorhynchus of the family Neoechinorhynchidae, Dendronucleatidae have randomly distributed dendritically branched giant hypodermic nuclei from which it derives its name.

The second and last novel by the Parisian author, it was published posthumously in 1924. Set as a love triangle during the , it proved controversial, as did his first psychological novel, , published in 1923. Le Bal du comte d'Orgel was adapted into a 1970 film.  Plot  It is Paris, 1920. François de Séryeuse is a young student of feudal nobility, son of (Count) Anne d'Orgel. At first she meets diplomat Paul Robin, a friend of both, at a performance by the Cirque Medrano. Here he meets Anne's wife, Countess Mahaut d'Orgel, and falls in love with her at first sight. Keeping this secret, and wishing to keep Anne friendly, he quickly inveigles himself into the d'Orgel household. François introduces the d'Orgels to his mother, Madame de Séryeuse, with whom he has trouble communicating. Anne traces a distant common descent for François and Mahaut from Grimoard de la Verberie. This rather tenuous link surprises them both. Day by day, Anne's friendship and François' mother's encouragement draw François and Mahaut closer together. Mahaut, adoring her husband, does not notice the feelings François has for her. They spend the summer holidays apart, each waiting for news from the other. Mahaut accepts her feelings for François, but not knowing what to do about them, she confides her love to Madme de Séryeuse, who slyly tells François. This encourages him to do what Mahaut dreaded: continue being friends with Anne, who in François' eyes is a fool. During an evening preparing for their ball, Mahaut confesses her feelings to her husband. He thinks it all a misunderstanding and does not take it seriously. Themes According to Jean Cocteau, Radiguet focuses on the psychology of his characters. In the vast majority of his writing, he explains what is going on in their minds, informing their decisions, commissions and omissions. In the first chapter, Radiguet gives the family tree of the main characters' families. He highlights their shared lineage with Grimoard de la Verberie (an addition to the novel) and Tascher de la Pagerie. * The rare mention of the physical environment is set in the countryside around the River Marne, liked by both Séryeuse and Mahaut. * The social environment is the bourgeoisie and Parisian nobility after World War I. The historical context is important. World War I and the Russian Revolution are touched upon almost at random. The characters live in postwar frivolity, thinking only of having a good time as much as possible. * In balance, the character of Paul Robin embodies the maladroit arriviste, a failure in everything he does, heightening the contrast with François' spontaneity. According to Galichon-Brasat, .. (\\"In this character, Radiguet condemns the model of the entrepreneur given by the character of Eugène de Rastignac in Honoré de Balzac\\"). Publication * The novel is known to have had several revisions, the first being of four hundred pages, before being sent to the printer. The final draft was published posthumously by Éditions Grasset, Radiguet having died of typhoid fever. * The draft was reviewed and corrected by Jean Cocteau and Joseph Kessel.. Cocteau helped Radiguet greatly with his editing, such that by the time it was published a critic could write: (\\"This is very good Cocteau\\"). Jacques-Émile Blanche had also started proofreading the book, just before his death. * The book can be read at several levels. It can be a \\"chaste romance novel\\", but Cocteau indicates, in his preface to the 1924 edition, that (\\"convention and propriety cover the most turbid and licentious kind of chastity\\"). Nadia Odouard, quoted by Galichon-Brasart for her psychoanalytical monograph on Radiguett's works,, in speculates that there is a homosexual dimension to the work, (\\"recall the relationship between Radiguet and Cocteau - including the strange onomastic game which gives the husband and lover feminine names - 'Seryeuse', 'Anne' - and the woman, conversely, a masculine-sounding first name, 'Mahaut'\\"). * Radiguet drew some inspiration from his own life – far less than in Le Diable au corps – and far more from the moralist literature of the 17th century. In particular, he does not disguise his references to La Princesse de Clèves by Madame de Lafayette. * A film adaptation was produced by Marc Allégret in 1970, Le Bal du comte d'Orgel, with Jean-Claude Brialy in the part of Anne d'Orgel. * The ruined Château de la Solitude at Plessis- Robinson and the Hôtel de Masseran inspired the description of the d'Orgel pile and its surroundings.

When diagnosed with breast cancer in 1997, she fought the disease with the help of doctors and survived. She founded the advocacy organization ICanServe which has the mission of arming \\"women with breast care health and breast cancer information through high impact campaigns.\\" In addition, Magsanoc-Alikpala is the managing director of Manila-based Asianeye Productions and a contributing producer to CNN. She was selected as one of three celebrity critics for the Philippine reality-show \\"Dokyu\\". She lives and works in Manila. Early career Magsanoc-Alikpala is the daughter of Philippine Daily Inquirer editor Letty Jimenez Magsanoc and Dr. Carlitos Magsanoc. Both of her brothers are doctors. Journalism career Magsanoc- Alikpala was a managing director of Asianeye Productions as well as a producer for ARD German television and a contributing producer to CNN. Asianeye made an extensive documentary on martial law called Batas Militar which got the \\"highest rating for any television documentary in the Philippines,\\" according to one newspaper account. She was a reporter for Voice of America and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Asianeye developed shows called \\"docu- musicals\\" for ABS-CBN's A Christmas Prayer, and the firm won awards on several occasions. In 2007, the Asianeye staff watched 200 movies made by the Philippine action movie star Fernando Poe, Jr. as part of an effort to make a TV special; Magsanoc-Alikpala divided the work to select footage for their project. She has produced and reported for documentaries through the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism, The Probe Team and for SkyCable News. As a broadcast journalist, she reported on significant stories, such as the capture of four Abu Sayyaf members in 2002; her reports were broadcast on the Voice of America. Breast cancer and ICanServe In 1997, Magsanoc-Alikpala was diagnosed with breast cancer. It was a transformative event in her life. She survived, but the experience changed her. In 1999, she started the I Can Serve Foundation along with her friend Crisann Celdran who wrote \\"we knew very little and had different experiences but shared one dream: that cancer survivors should not go through this path alone.\\" She encourages women to make breast self-examination a \\"lifetime habit.\\" According to one source, the Philippines has the highest incidence of breast cancer in Southeast Asia. The I Can Serve Foundation, sometimes identified with all words together as ICanServe, has been described as a \\"dynamic patient support networking group\\" and has been lauded for its efforts to alleviate the rising incidence of breast cancer among Filipino women. One woman who survived breast cancer joined ICanServe afterwards, and she described Magsanoc-Alikpala as \\"pretty\\", \\"perky\\", and \\"talented\\" and wrote Magsanoc-Alikpala's efforts to organize fellow survivors was a \\"miracle\\". In 2004, Magsanoc-Alikpala was awarded the Bessie B. Legarda Memorial Foundation Award. The foundation had its tenth anniversary in 2007. She published advice about how to organize cancer support groups. The organization, along with the Philippine Cancer Society, organizes a variety of initiatives to promote awareness, including \\"fun runs\\" since 2002 in such cities as Fort Bonifacio Global City in Taguig. Magsanoc-Alikpala works with government officials including Philippine Senate President Manny Villar to promote awareness. It promotes awareness with local officials such as in Marikina City. Its \\"Pink Kitchen\\" creative promotional effort, credited as the idea of Bettina Osmena, features top chefs serving fine cuisine; the events are well publicized in the media. The Pink Kitchen event has been described as \\"one of Manila’s most anticipated food festivals; the 2008 event showcased over 50 chefs serving French, Italian, Spanish, Middle Eastern, Indian, Burmese, Japanese, Thai, Indonesian and Singaporean specialties. One chef named a new dish after her; chef Sincioco’s Tickled Pink Salad a la Kara featured beetroots and a dark pink tinge in a \\"fuchsia concoction.\\" In 2006, the organization planned the Philippine's first nationwide early breast cancer detection effort. Celebrity and awards In 2007, Magsanoc-Alikpala was chosen as one of three celebrity critics on a popular Philippine television show Dokyu which has an \\"eclectic panel\\" of experts examining film projects. The TV program is a competition-based reality program which gives a platform to independent documentary filmmakers. She offers advice and encouragement to aspiring talents. In 2008, Magsanoc- Alikpala won a Balance Award from the magazine Working Mom which recognized balance between career and family; a reporter described Magsanoc-Alikpala's efforts as \\"indefatigable ... as chairperson of the breast cancer awareness support group.\\" Filmography * Batas Militar (1997) * Limampung Taong Ligawan: The Pinoy TV Story (2003) * The Assassination of Ninoy Aquino (2010) * Marcos: The Downfall of the Dictator (2011) References External links * Living people Breast cancer survivors Filipino television journalists Year of birth missing (living people) Place of birth missing (living people) People from Manila Women television journalists CNN people ","title":"Kara Magsanoc-Alikpala"},{"id":"25053776","text":"Algernon Sidney Gray (8 January 1814 – 29 September 1878) was an attorney, colonel in the antebellum Virginia militia (Rockingham County), delegate to the 1861 Virginia secession convention, member of the Virginia General Assembly, U.S. Marshal, and philanthropist.

He was a community leader among Hawaii's Japanese residents, serving as chief editor of the Nippu Jiji, then the largest Japanese-language newspaper in Hawaii and the mainland United States, and organizing efforts to foster positive Japan-U.S. relations and address discriminatory legislation, labor rights and other issues facing Japanese Americans.Niiya, Brian. \\"Yasutaro Soga,\\" Densho Encyclopedia. Retrieved July 31, 2014. An accomplished news writer and tanka poet before the war, during his time in camp Soga authored one of the earliest memoirs of the wartime detention of Japanese Americans, Tessaku Seikatsu or Life Behind Barbed Wire. Life Born Yasutaro Soga to a relatively wealthy family in Tokyo, he lost both parents while still a teenager. After studying for but not completing degrees in several subjects, Soga moved to Yokohama and took work as a retailer and exporter before relocating to Waianae, Hawai'i in 1896. He worked for plantation stores in Waianae, Waipahu and Moloka'i, and then moved to Honolulu in 1899, where he took a job as a reporter for the Hawaii Shimpo. In 1905, after leaving the Shimpo over a dispute with its editors, he became editor of the Yamato Shimbun, which he renamed the Nippu Jiji in November of the following year. In 1908, Soga, Fred Kinzaburo Makino, Motoyuki Negoro, and Yoichi Tasaka formed the Higher Wage Association (Zokyu Kisei Kai). Together, they protested the low wages that Japanese plantation workers were making relative to other ethnic groups. In 1909, Soga used the Nippu Jiji to champion the cause of Japanese plantation workers then striking for higher wages. He became one of the leaders of the territory-wide strike and was later arrested and convicted of conspiracy with the other founders of the Higher Wage Association. His wife, Kozue Sugino, fell ill while Soga was in prison, and died soon after his release. Soga was arrested within hours of the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and, like many other Issei community leaders, spent the entire war confined in a series of detention centers run by the Army and the Justice Department. He spent the first several months of the war at the Army-run Sand Island Internment Camp, located at the entrance to Honolulu Harbor, before being transferred to the mainland. He arrived in San Francisco in August 1942 and was held at Fort McDowell for a month, after which he was again transferred to the Army internment camp at Lordsburg, New Mexico. In June 1943 he was moved to the DOJ camp at Santa Fe, where he would remain until October 1945. Soga returned to Hawai'i in November 1945 and published a memoir of his experiences in camp, first as a series of articles in the Hawaii Times (the Nippu Jiji's new title) and then as a book in 1948. He continued to write poetry and publish articles for the Hawaii Times in the years after the war. In 1952, after the Walter-McCarren Act removed race-based restrictions on citizenship, Soga became a naturalized U.S. citizen. He published an autobiography, Gojunen no Hawaii Kaiko or Fifty Years of Hawaii Memories, in 1953. He died March 7, 1957.

The drive is between the town of Morrison and the town of Idledale. The scenic drive connects to the west border of the Red Rocks Mountain Park District. The Denver Mountain Parks owns a strip of canyon on both sides of Bear Creek. The park was purchased in 1928, and the road ran along the stream and was subject to flooding. During the 1930s and early 1940s the Civilian Conservation Corp (CCC) moved parts of the road away from the stream and raised it above the flood plain. The road is maintained by the Colorado State Highway Department. It was constructed and first maintained by the State Department of Highways, Jefferson County, and the City of Denver Mountain Parks.Ann Moss, Bear Creek Canyon Scenic Mountain Drive,\\" National Register Inventory—Nomination Form, September 26, 1990, in digital files of National Park Service, Washington, D.C. The first section of the road had been a narrow stagecoach route and needed to be graded not to exceed grades more than six percent. Road improve began in 1914, with the construction of a road from Denver to Morrison. The entire route was completed by 1921. The scenic drive is an important part of Denver's Park and Parkway System since it is the southern gateway and provides the first glimpse of the beauties of the Denver Mountain Park System. This scenic drive is unique in the system since it is designed through tight canyon lands beside a gushing mountain stream. The drive expresses the idea of expanding the park and parkway system into the mountains and through rough terrain and unusual landforms outside the city limits yet accessible to city residents and tourists. One of the purposes of the drive was to protect the area from the encroachment of growth and has significance in community development and planning. Growth could damage the scenic character, allow structures in the floodplain, and remove this special area from public use. This idea of protecting lands outside the city limits for scenic drives was similar to the Park and Parkway Movement, which was occurring nationwide at this time. The drive follows the recommendations within the Olmsted Brother's plan. This drive preserves lands along a major mountain creek corridor which is specifically recommended in the Olmsted Brother's plan. Olmsted, Jr. chose lands adjacent to all the major mountain creek corridors within close reach of Denver and specifically recommended that these lands along Bear Creek be preserved as part of the Denver Mountain Park System. The road was engineered and constructed by the CCC and exemplifies their quality and skills. The skills are not shown through shelters, picnic facilities, or other public use elements, but instead through the construction of a road and the massive retaining walls. The road must withstand the force of a roaring mountain creek, constantly battering at its edges and must be cut through solid granite. It was designated the southern access to the mountain parks and set the stage for the mountain environment which would be experienced. It is one of a few canyon drives in the system, winding through steep enclosing cliffs. The drive provides a unique visual and sensory experience to its users. Much of Bear Creek Canyon Drive and adjacent lands to the south were included in Olmsted's acquisition plan of 1914. This drive was originally called the Denver Motor Club Road because Idledale was the location of the well-known Colorado Motor Club. Just to the east of this district's boundaries, in the town of Morrison, columns marked the southern entry to the Denver Mountain Park System. The now demolished gateway columns were constructed to provide a positive sense of entry. The McFarland Gateway Columns were constructed in 1917 on either side of the road. Once people had passed through this entry they had entered the Denver Mountain Park's park and parkway system. By the time they had reached this district's boundaries they were tightly enclosed by steep granite cliffs and within the drainage corridor of Bear Creek. From the beginning, Bear Creek Canyon Drive was famous for its awe inspiring granite cliffs, diverse vegetation, immense number of wildflowers, and roaring mountain stream. The area became a favorite spot for streamside camping, fishing, and picnicking because of the abundant water, shade, grassy nooks, and willow fringed retreats suitable for tents and fishing. The drive was considered a \\"treasure house of beauty and pleasure\\" with an abundance of clear clean water heavily stocked from the Denver Mountain Park's own spawning ponds in Starbuck Park just up the road at Idledale. One unique element is the water pipeline, which brings drinking water from Idledale to the town of Morrison. This pipeline, originally constructed in the 1920s, is located on the south side of Bear Creek at the edge of the granite cliffs and is not in the nominated boundaries. Bear Creek Canyon Drive is enclosed on each side by narrow perpendicular walls of solid granite. These dark stone cliffs tower many feet above the road and create an enclosed atmosphere. The creek roars over huge boulders throughout the length of the drive creating small waterfalls and swirling pools of water. The original road ran directly adjacent to the creek bed and crossed the creek as needed to remain on the most gently sloping terrain. Since Bear Creek Canyon was the site of some of the worst floods in Colorado, this road layout was not safe. By 1917 concrete bridges were constructed to reduce the chances of wash out and provide a safer drive. The continued location of the road in the floodway was not appropriate.

Two weeks before the murders took place, Wrinkles' mother had made efforts to have him committed to a psychiatric facility due to his erratic behavior, but was informed that he didn't meet the criteria. He was then hospitalized at a different facility; after three days of evaluations, a psychiatrist concluded that he was not \\"gravely disabled\\", and discharged him.Matthew Eric Wrinkles. clarkprosecutor.org, retrieved June 28, 2016. After his release, despite a protective order in effect, Wrinkles went looking for Debra. He showed up at her place of employment, and at the homes of two of her friends, demanding to see her. He was unsuccessful each time. On July 20, 1994, Wrinkles, his wife, and their attorneys met for a provisional hearing in their divorce proceeding. They reached an agreement to set aside the protective order, and for Wrinkles to have visitation. They also agreed that Debra and Wrinkles would meet, with the children, at a restaurant later that day, but Debra elected not to keep that appointment. Later that night, Wrinkles, dressed in camouflage clothing and face paint, armed with a .357 handgun and a knife, drove to the home of Tony Fulkerson. He parked a block away, cut the telephone wires, and kicked in the back door. When he fled the scene, Fulkerson was dead in the bedroom with four gunshot wounds to his face, hip, chest, and back; Natalie was dead on the front porch with a gunshot wound to her face; and Debra was dead in the hallway with a gunshot wound to her chest and shoulder area. Wrinkles was later arrested at the home of his cousin, where the .357 murder weapon was recovered. He was convicted of the murders on June 14, 1995, and sentenced to death. On November 3, 2009, after the Indiana Supreme Court declined Wrinkles' final review motion, an execution date of December 12, 2009, was announced. A week later, Wrinkles appeared as a guest, via remote feed from the prison, on a segment of The Oprah Winfrey Show, where he was confronted by members of his victims' families. Execution Wrinkles' last meal—prime rib, loaded baked potato, pork chops with fries, rolls and two salads with ranch dressing—was served on December 9. Indiana serves the traditional last meal three days prior to execution, maintaining that a condemned prisoner tends to lose appetite as the time of execution approaches. On his way to the execution building within Indiana State Prison, it was noted by a fellow inmate Rick Parish that Wrinkles shouted \\"I'll see you fellas!\\" down the cell block corridor as a last goodbye. His execution by lethal injection took place as scheduled; the time of death was 12:39 AM CST on December 12, 2009. He was 49 years old. Wrinkles declined to make a final statement, saying only, \\"Let's get it done. Let's lock and load ... it's plagiarized, but what the hell.\\" See also *Capital punishment in Indiana *Capital punishment in the United States *List of people executed in Indiana *List of most recent executions by jurisdiction References 1960 births 2009 deaths 1994 murders in the United States American people convicted of murder People convicted of murder by Indiana People executed by Indiana by lethal injection People executed for murder 21st- century executions of American people 21st-century executions by Indiana Familicides ","title":"Eric Wrinkles"},{"id":"25053903","text":"The Stone House of Indian Creek is located near Cynthiana, Kentucky.

SSF's website states that it is faithful to the traditional Latin Mass and Catholic doctrine and morals.Welcome to Servi.org -- from their website Foundation and Purpose SSF was founded in 1977 on the feast of the Holy Family and was placed under the patronage of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. The community has been located in Colorado since February 1977. The motherhouse with its chapel is situated on ten acres of land south of the Black Forest near the city of Colorado Springs, Colorado. Their stated purpose is \\"to aspire after and achieve by the grace of God the sanctification of its members and the salvation of souls through their prayers, sacrifices and apostolate\\". It intends to accomplish this chiefly by attachment to the Holy Sacrifice of the traditional Latin Mass and to the Roman Breviary. Other important devotions observed by all the members are Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament, the frequent reception of the sacrament of Penance, keeping days of recollection on a regular basis, and praying the Holy Rosary with one of the approved litanies daily. Also, frequent visits to the Blessed Sacrament as well as mental prayer and spiritual reading are considered most important for all of the members, who are to regard holiness of life as their primary objective. According to their website, their apostolate is the salvation of souls through the Mass, the Catholic Liturgy, the dispensing of the Sacraments, traditional Catholic sermons, morality, the spiritual life, and teaching of the Baltimore catechism.About Us-Servants of the Holy Family -- from their website They allow the public to attend many of their liturgical ceremonies.Traditional Latin Mass Schedule-Servants of the Holy Family Apostolic Works leftAccording to their website, the traditional Latin Mass is the center of the spiritual life for SSF.

Retrieved 11 November 2018.29 August 1287) was a Hiberno-Norman peer and soldier. He was the second son of Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Gloucester and his wife Maud de Lacy, Countess of Gloucester. In 1272 he served a term as Lieutenant of the Duchy of Aquitaine. On 26 January 1276 he was granted the Lordship of Thomond by Edward I of England; he spent the next eight years attempting to conquer it from the O'Brien dynasty, kings of Thomond. Career  Thomas was born in about 1245 in Tonbridge, Kent, England, the second eldest son of Richard de Clare and Maud de Lacy.G. E. Cokayne, The Complete Peerage He and his brother Bogo received gifts from King Henry III when they were studying at Oxford from 1257–59.Michael Altschul (1965). A Baronial Family in Medieval England: The Clares, 1217–1314. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press. p. 177. Thomas was a close friend and intimate advisor of Prince Edward of England, who would in 1272 accede to the throne as King Edward I. Together they took part in the Ninth Crusade. He held many important posts such as Governor of Colchester Castle (1266) and Governor of The City of London (1273). He was made Commander of the English forces in Munster, Ireland and created Lord of Inchiquin and Youghal. On 26 January 1276, he was granted the entire lordship of Thomond by King Edward. That same year, he jointly commanded a Norman army along with Sir Geoffrey de Geneville, Justiciar of Ireland against the Irish clans of County Wicklow. They were joined by a contingent of men from Connacht led by his father-in-law Maurice FitzGerald, 3rd Lord of Offaly. Thomas and Justiciar de Geneville's forces attacked the Irish at Glenmalure, but they were soundly defeated and suffered severe losses.Annette J. Otway-Ruthven, A History of Medieval Ireland, pp.201–202, Google Books, retrieved on 12-11-09  Civil War in Thomond  Civil war raged in Thomond between the rival factions of the O'Brien dynasty. In 1276, Brian Ruad, the deposed King of Thomond appealed to Thomas for support to help him regain his kingdom from his great-nephew Toirrdelbach MacTaidg O' Brien, who had usurped the throne. In return for his aid, Brian Ruad promised that Thomas would be allowed to colonise all the land between Athsollus in Quin and Limerick.Joe Power, Normans in Thomond, retrieved 12-11-09 Together, Thomas and Brian Ruad expelled Toirrdelbach MacTaidg O'Brien and recaptured Clonroad which the latter had taken from Brian Ruad. O'Brien escaped to Galway where he elicited the help of his cousin William de Burgh, and in 1277 together with the assistance from clans, MacNamara and O'Dea they defeated the combined forces of Thomas and Brian Ruad. The latter fled to Bunratty Castle, but Thomas had his former ally hanged and drawn for treason.Power, Normans in Thomond The civil war continued for the next seven years, with Thomas supporting Brian Ruad's son Donnchad against Toirrdelbach; however, following the drowning death of Donnchad in 1284, Toirrdelbach emerged the victor. Thereafter until his death in 1306, Toirrdelbach MacTaidg O'Brien ruled as undisputed King of Thomond and Thomas had no choice but to accommodate him. O'Brien rented part of Bunratty Manor at £121 per annum. In 1280, Thomas embarked on a castle-building project at Quin, but was disrupted in his efforts by the O'Briens and MacNamaras. Thomas also reconstructed Bunratty Castle in stone, replacing the earlier wooden building.  Marriage and children  In February 1275, he married Juliana FitzGerald, the 12-year-old daughter of Maurice FitzGerald, 3rd Lord of Offaly and Maud de Prendergast.Calendar of Documents relating to Ireland, 1285–1292, No. 1142 summarises a Final concord made on 18 February 1274/5 in which Maurice Fitz Maurice (which was the patronymic version of the name of Juliana's father) agreed that specified property would come to Thomas and his heirs begotten of Juliana his wife if Maurice died without male heirs of his own. This arrangement appears to have been Thomas and Juliana's marriage settlement. During their marriage, Thomas and Juliana lived in Ireland and in England. For instance, on 5 May 1284 the King notified his bailiffs and lieges in Ireland of the attorneys who were to act in Ireland on behalf of the couple as they were then in England. This arrangement was to continue for three years, except when Thomas and Juliana went to Ireland.Calendar of Documents relating to Ireland, 1252–1284, No. 2210. Thomas and Juliana had four children: * Maud de Clare (1276–1327), married firstly, Robert de Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford, by whom she had issue; and secondly Robert de Welles, 2nd Baron Welles. * Gilbert de Clare, Lord of Thomond, (3 February 12811308) * Richard de Clare, Steward of Forest of Essex, 1st Lord Clare, Lord of Thomond (after 128110 May 1318), married a woman by the name of Joan, by whom he had one son, Thomas. He was killed at the Battle of Dysert O'Dea. * Margaret de Clare (c. 1 April 128722 October 1333/3 January 1334), married firstly, Gilbert de Umfraville; and secondly Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere, by whom she had issue.  Death  When evidence was taken in 1302 to prove the age of his son Gilbert, it was established that Thomas had died on 29 August 1287.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, 1st series, Vol. 4, No. 54. A mid-18th century compilation known as the Dublin Annals of Inisfallen states that Thomas was killed in battle against Turlough son of Teige and others. However, none of the earlier records of his death indicate that Thomas met a violent end. Some of the witnesses to Gilbert's age in 1302 referred to the date of Thomas' death in their calculations but all were silent as to its circumstances. This and much other evidence on the subject has been set out and evaluated by Goddard Henry Orpen of Trinity College, Dublin.Goddard Henry Orpin, Ireland Under The Normans, Vol. 4, pp. 99–104. Thomas was succeeded as Lord of Thomond by his eldest son, Gilbert who was six years old. His widow Juliana, aged 24 years, would go on to marry two more times.

As a member of a farmers' government, he was also involved in attempts to alleviate drought- induced poverty in southern Alberta and in investigations into the establishment of a provincial wheat pool. UFA Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) began to see Brownlee as a better leader than the indecisive Greenfield. A group of them attempted to force Greenfield to resign in Brownlee's favour. Though Brownlee opposed these attempts, initially threatening to resign if Greenfield did, he was eventually persuaded to accept the premiership if Greenfield willingly relinquished it. Brownlee became premier November 23, 1925. Background Brownlee began his legal career in Calgary, and the UFA was one of his firm's major clients. One of the projects he undertook for it was the creation of the United Grain Growers (UGG), of whose securities division he became general manager in 1919.Foster (1981) 45 He also travelled around Alberta with UFA president Henry Wise Wood answering UFA members' legal questions while Wood spoke to them about politics and the farmers' movement. Though Brownlee was not initially interested in the UFA's political activities, this changed through his association with Wood and Progressive Party of Canada leader Thomas Crerar.Foster (1981) 48–49 Until 1919, the UFA's political activities were limited to advocacy, but that year it decided to run candidates in the 1921 provincial election.Byrne 34–35 Despite Brownlee's burgeoning interest in politics, he did not view himself as part of the UFA's political branch, and did not run as a candidate; indeed, he was on vacation in Victoria, British Columbia, for most of the campaign.Foster (1981) 53–54 The UFA contested the election without a leader, so when it won 38 of the 61 seats in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta it did not know who it would recommend to form a government as Premier of Alberta. Wood was not interested and suggested that Brownlee should take the position, to the latter's astonishment.Foster (2004) 81 Brownlee did not believe that, as an urbanite and lawyer, he would be acceptable to the rural UFA caucus, and declined; the position went to Herbert Greenfield.Foster (2004) 82 Entry into cabinet and legislature Though the UFA MLAs were not willing to accept a non-farmer as premier, many of them realized that the post of Attorney- General should go to a lawyer. Others were less convinced, and Brownlee was invited to address the UFA caucus. He acknowledged that there was no constitutional requirement on the question, but advised that a non-lawyer attorney-general would be wholly reliant on the advice of the lawyers on his staff. With the caucus convinced, Greenfield asked Brownlee to accept the position. Brownlee demurred, reluctant to take the resulting cut in income, not eager to leave his family in Calgary to work in Edmonton (the provincial capital), and leery of the high expectations invested in the new government by the province's farmers. Ultimately, a combination of duty, loyalty, and ambition convinced him to accept the position.Foster (1981) 55 Though the choice of cabinet ministers is traditionally the prerogative of the premier, as part of the UFA's agenda of democratic reform Greenfield agreed to present his choices to the caucus for vetting. Brownlee was approved August 11, 1921, and was sworn in two days later.Foster (1981) 62 Neither he nor Greenfield had run as a candidate in the election, and neither was a member of the legislature. Percival Baker, the UFA member elected for Ponoka, had died on election day, opening up a seat for one of them. A second seat, Peace River, became available when incumbent Donald MacBeth Kennedy resigned to run in the 1921 federal election. Greenfield seemed a more reasonable candidate for that rugged northern riding than the urban lawyer Brownlee, and so Brownlee was acclaimed as Ponoka's MLA December 9, 1921.Foster (1981) 68 Advisor to the government Brownlee's counsel was invaluable to Premier Herbert Greenfield.Brownlee was the only lawyer in a government composed primarily of farmers, and the rest of the cabinet drew heavily on his expertise. Its reliance on him extended beyond legal issues to such matters as how to write a business letter. Greenfield was among the most dependent, and forwarded most controversial issues to his attorney-general for a draft response; Greenfield often signed the draft and sent it out unchanged.Foster (1981) 64 The premier eventually relied on Brownlee so heavily that Brownlee set the agenda for cabinet meetings.Foster (1981) 82 The government also relied on Brownlee in the legislature, where it found itself under relentless attack from the John R. Boyle-led Liberals.Foster (1981) 74 Brownlee had the widest debating experience of the UFA members,Foster (1981) 73 and he was increasingly called upon to counter these attacks. His maiden speech was typical of him: \\"I came into this House with considerable trepidation, because I knew that sitting opposite would be the former giants of this House, men with ability, experience, and skill. Since coming in I've listened to all these men—giving their best—and now I blush at my own modesty.\\"Foster (1981) 74–75 When Greenfield was asked a difficult question in the legislature, he often leaned over to Brownlee, his seatmate, who supplied him with an answer in full view of the legislature. Many UFA members found this practice humiliating.Foster (1981) 75 Brownlee's importance to the government in the legislature was illustrated by an incident in 1922. Brownlee was on vacation in Victoria during a special sitting of the legislature. While his presence was usually considered crucial, the only item of business scheduled for the session was uncontroversial, and passed by a large margin. However, once this item was dispensed with, some members complained that the C$100 payment that they were to receive for the special session was too low. Greenfield brought a motion to double it; the amount was increased to $250 in committee. At a time when many farmers earned less than $250 per year, the move cost the UFA dearly in the eyes of its supporters. Many UFA MLAs privately suggested that the incident would have been avoided had Brownlee been present.Foster (1981) 83 On another occasion, in 1924, Brownlee was absent from the legislature due to illness. Boyle called him to assure him that he could rest easy, since the Liberals would not raise any difficult issues in his absence. While Brownlee appreciated the gesture, all involved recognized it as an admission that the government was helpless in the legislature without its strongman.Foster (1981) 107 Brownlee's work as an MLA extended beyond the legislature. He gave close attention to correspondence from his constituents, especially those alleging improper treatment at Ponoka's psychiatric hospital. He prepared thoroughly for speaking engagements in his riding, trying to anticipate all possible questions. These measures were reflected in his support in the largely rural riding, where the Calgary lawyer became a popular and well-respected MLA. Advocate for conservatism Many of the elected UFA members espoused radical political doctrines calculated to transform the provincial government. Brownlee quickly became identified with the caucus's conservative faction. At the caucus meeting that approved his appointment, he put an end to discussion of whether nominations for justices of the peace should come from UFA locals or its central political committee by asserting that they would continue to be handled by the office of the Attorney-General. Later, many UFA MLAs argued that only motions explicitly declaring a lack of confidence in the government should be treated as motions of non-confidence.Foster (1981) 76 They were concerned that supporters of the government who nonetheless disagreed with it on a specific issue might be pressured to refrain from voting their consciences on motions, such as money bills, that were conventionally considered tests of the government's confidence.Foster (1981) 77 Brownlee warned these MLAs that regardless of their beliefs, the Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta was free to request the government's resignation any time he considered that it lacked or did not merit the legislature's confidence.Foster (1981) 76–77 Despite this warning, UFA MLAs John Russell Love and Alex Moore proposed a resolution in the legislature changing the convention. The proposal attracted notice from across Canada; R. B. Bennett advised Brownlee, his former clerk, to warn Moore and Love that it was unconstitutional and demand that they withdraw it. Brownlee was reluctant to do so, since a similar proposal had been part of the UFA's election platform, and instead moved successful amendments weakening the motion to a vague \\"statement of intent\\". Brownlee clashed again with the UFA's radical elements on the question of a provincial bank. The writings of C. H. Douglas advocating an economic system that he called social credit were attracting notice in Alberta, and his adherents included many UFA members.Foster (1981) 89 Led by George Bevington, they sponsored a resolution at the UFA convention in January 1923 calling for the creation of a government-owned bank.Foster (1981) 89–90 After Bevington's introduction, support for the resolution was running high; Brownlee cooled enthusiasm with a speech of his own warning delegates that Alberta's debt load could not manage the programs that Bevington proposed that a provincial bank should undertake.Byrne 44 Even so, the convention passed a resolution calling on the provincial government to apply for a bank charter from the federal government, which was responsible for banking under the British North America Act, 1867.Foster (1981) 90 At Brownlee's recommendation, the Greenfield government struck a commission under the leadership of University of Alberta economist D. A. MacGibbon, which strongly recommended against the establishment of a provincial bank.Jones 64 This mirrored Brownlee's own conclusion, reached after investigating state-run banks in New Zealand and New South Wales.Foster (1981) 93 At the 1924 UFA convention, Bevington and his followers reaffirmed their demands; Brownlee responded by pointing to the findings of the MacGibbon commission and to his contention that the proposal was unconstitutional and would bankrupt the province.Byrne 44–45Foster (1981) 105 In this he was supported by Henry Wise Wood, whom Bevington was challenging for the UFA presidency.Foster (1981) 106 Brownlee proposed instead that the government's treasury branches should begin to accept deposits. Brownlee also advocated a conservative approach on budgetary issues. The UFA government inherited a large budget deficit, and Brownlee was dissatisfied with Greenfield's early efforts at reducing it.Foster (1981) 80 In 1922, he warned the premier that unless the government sharply cut expenditures, he would find it difficult to defend its fiscal policy in that year's session of the legislature.Foster (1981) 80–81 In 1924, unsatisfied with Greenfield's response, he made an example of his own department, cutting staff and taking a strict approach to spending. In 1923, he found an ally for his position in new provincial treasurer Richard Gavin Reid, who impressed on his cabinet colleagues the need for thrift and recommended the creation of a purchasing department for coordinating government expenditures.Foster (1981) 111 Railways and natural resources The province's poor financial situation was due in part to its $5 million annual expenditure on railways, comprising 37 percent of the 1922 budget. These expenditures resulted from the collapse of four small-railroad syndicates, which left the government to finance the rail construction. Brownlee believed that these lines, the largest of which was the Edmonton, Dunvegan and British Columbia (ED&BC;) line, should be sold to either the Canadian National Railway or the Canadian Pacific Railway.Foster (1981) 81 Though neither was interested in purchasing the lines, in 1925 both expressed an interest in leasing the ED&BC.; However, the Royal Bank of Canada, which held the mortgage on the ED&BC;, refused to consent to any lease arrangement unless the Alberta government redeemed its stock in the railway as security for the mortgage.Foster (1981) 115 Brownlee was inclined to agree with Minister of Railways Vernor Smith that the government should buy the mortgage from the Royal Bank and become the owner and operator of the line, but Greenfield was resistant to this approach and resolution of the railways question had to wait until Brownlee was premier.Foster (1981) 115–116 Brownlee was also active on natural resource issues. Alberta, along with Saskatchewan and Manitoba, had been admitted into Confederation without being granted the control over its natural resources that the older provinces enjoyed over theirs. While the federal government did provide a compensatory grant in lieu of resource rights, Alberta sought control over the resources not only because it believed that this would yield higher revenues than the grant, but out of sheer pride. In 1920, Prime Minister Arthur Meighen committed the federal government in principle to transferring resource rights; all that remained to discuss were the terms.Foster (1981) 86–87 Alberta, while willing to forgo the annual subsidy, wanted compensation for some of the land and resources previously awarded by the federal government to private interests, including of land granted to eastern railway companies, mineral leases that deprived the government of royalties for more than half of the of coal extracted from Alberta annually, and assorted areas with hydroelectric potential that had been yielded to private companies.Foster (1981) 87 Liberal leader John R. Boyle urged the federal government to reject the natural resource concessions that Brownlee sought. Brownlee became the province's chief negotiator on resource questions in October 1921. Though early attempts at reaching agreement were hampered by the unwillingness of the Maritime provinces to agree to the necessary constitutional amendments unless their own annual subsidies were increased,Foster (1981) 88 negotiations between the provincial and federal government continued intermittently throughout the 1920s.Foster (1981) 102 Liberal Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King occasionally appeared receptive to Alberta's demands, but never fully agreed to them. A possible explanation for this is found in a 1924 letter from Alberta Liberal Party leader John R. Boyle to King, explaining that the UFA was likely to lose the next provincial election to Boyle's Liberals \\"unless something extraordinary happens. That extraordinary thing which Greenfield wants to happen now is obtaining from you the natural resources at once.\\"Foster (1981) 114 Despite this letter, the sides seemed close to agreement in early 1925: at a January conference Alberta accepted in principle a federal offer of three years of continuing subsidy after the transfer of resource rights. After an exhaustive series of meetings between Brownlee and the federal counsel, the agreement went back to the governments for approval.Foster (1981) 114–115 As Greenfield and Brownlee expressed their impatience with federal inaction, an intergovernmental meeting was convened in May. The meeting proceeded at a leisurely pace into June, after which King announced that his cabinet would like the summer to consider the agreement in greater detail. The Albertans returned home in disgust.Jones 69 The consequences of continued control of Alberta's resources by the federal government extended beyond the merely financial. As Alberta's smaller towns and rural areas were being connected to the electrical grid, Calgary Power made an application to the federal government for hydroelectric rights on the upper Bow River. Not wanting these rights to fall into private hands, Brownlee made an application of his own on behalf of the Alberta government. It was denied by Charles Stewart, federal Minister of the Interior and the Premier of Alberta whom the UFA had defeated in 1921.Foster (1981) 102 In 1924, the UFA government passed the Mineral Tax Act, which taxed mineral rightsholders at a rate of three cents per acre.Foster (1981) 107–108 The two largest such rightsholders, the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Hudson's Bay Company, urged the federal government to use its power of disallowance to put a stop to the legislation. When the federal government complied, Brownlee protested its action on three grounds: first, as a direct tax the proposed levy was within Alberta's rights under section 92 of the British North America Act, 1867, and it was constitutional convention for the federal government to exercise disallowance only when the impugned legislation was clearly unconstitutional. Second, disallowance allowed the province no recourse to the courts, where the constitutionality of the legislation could be tested. Third, the federal government's stated reasons for disallowing the legislation, which were released belatedly by justice minister Ernest Lapointe, were (according to Brownlee) erroneous and led Brownlee to suggest that Lapointe, a Québécois lawyer trained in the civil law tradition of his home province rather than the common law system used in the rest of Canada, must be unfamiliar with the land-holding system outside of Quebec. Brownlee's attacks were rejected, and the disallowance stood.Foster (1981) 108 Agricultural policy The UFA took office at a time of drought in the southern regions of the province. At Brownlee's instigation, the government appointed a three-person panel, led by Charles Alexander Magrath, to investigate the problem. In 1922 the government passed the Drought Relief Act.Foster (1981) 78 The Act, a Brownlee brainchild, created a Drought Relief Commissioner to whom farmers in affected areas could turn for financial counselling and asset administration.Foster (1981) 78–79 It authorized the adjustment of farmers' debts to levels that were within the debtors' means, but still sufficiently acceptable to creditors that their willingness to make loans would not disappear altogether.Jones 63–65 Brownlee hoped that this system would provide affected farmers with sound financial advice and facilitate the fair division of farmers' assets among competing creditors without forcing farmers to pay high legal fees.Foster (1981) 79 In 1923 this was replaced by the Debt Adjustment Act, which strengthened the commissioner's powers and was intended to extend his jurisdiction over the entire province; due to opposition from lenders, the portions of the act dealing with other than drought-stricken areas were never proclaimed.Foster (1981) 93–94 Charles Alexander Magrath headed a panel tasked with examining the problem of southern drought.The name change of the legislation reflected Brownlee's growing belief that farmers' financial troubles were due to factors more systemic than lack of rain. Angry over the federal government's decision to allow the first incarnation of the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB) to lapse, many Albertan farmers began to advocate the \\"pooling\\" of their wheat, which would render individual farmers less susceptible to the machinations of grain speculators by introducing collective marketing, with each farmer receiving an averaged, identical price. Farmers in Saskatchewan and Manitoba were more adamant about the return of the CWB; Prime Minister King eventually agreed to its re- creation, provided that at least two of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba passed enabling legislation and found the personnel necessary to sit on the Board. By June 1923, the provinces had not found anybody suitable. Interest in pooling experienced a resurgence.Foster (1981) 96 In July, a UFA meeting, which Brownlee attended as the government's representative, endorsed the creation of a wheat pool as soon as practicable. Brownlee and his cabinet colleague Richard Gavin Reid undertook an investigation of how soon this might be, which included a trip to San Francisco to meet with Aaron Sapiro, an American agricultural cooperative leader. Sapiro proclaimed that a wheat pool could be organized in a few weeks, though both Brownlee and Reid disagreed and returned to Canada committed to caution.Foster (1981) 97 However, in their absence the Edmonton Journal and Calgary Herald had invited Sapiro to tour Alberta, and his speeches stirred up extravagant expectations among UFA members for immediate action, in time for the new organization to market the 1923 crop.Foster (1981) 97–98Rolph 142 Faced with the zeal of its membership, the UFA leadership appointed a 17-person committee, including Brownlee, to create the Alberta Cooperative Wheat Producers Limited.Foster (1981) 98 The membership fee was to be three dollars, and the organization was to work with similar organizations in Saskatchewan and Manitoba.Foster (1981) 98–99 The provincial government—at Brownlee's insistence—and the UGG both provided startup loans. The UGG also took the lead in agreeing to let its grain elevators be used by the pool, which allowed Brownlee to defeat those committee members who thought the new company should acquire its own elevators. By the end of August it was obvious that the organizations in Saskatchewan and Manitoba were not going to be ready in time for the 1923 crop, and the committee decided to proceed alone. It determined that if farmers representing half of Alberta's total wheat acreage agreed to pool their crop by September 15, the pool would proceed. Brownlee believed that this was an impossible objective.Foster (1981) 99 Despite the experimental and unproven nature of the model and the as-yet nonexistent organization that was to execute it, this objective was met.Foster (1981) 99–100 The Alberta Wheat Pool was born. By the following year's harvest, comparable organizations had formed in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, and a Central Selling Agency (CSA) was formed to sell all three provinces' wheat.Foster (1981) 109 The CSA's first president, Alexander James McPhail (whom Brownlee helped select), offered Brownlee the position of CSA general manager, at the attractive salary of $20,000 per year (a figure that Brownlee had helped set). At the urging of his government colleagues and the UFA leadership, both of who felt his continued presence in Edmonton was vital to the UFA government's hold on power, he declined;Foster (1981) 110 he was instead made the CSA's general counsel.Rolph 152 Brownlee was also heavily involved in the creation of a livestock pool and three dairy pools, as a sort of \\"poolmania\\" hit Alberta farmers. Prohibition and Sunday shopping As Attorney-General, Brownlee inherited the prohibition implemented by the previous Liberal government. While the UFA base and public opinion both favoured prohibition, the existing law was full of loopholes and unevenly enforced. Some judges, opponents of prohibition, refused to convict defendants charged with liquor offences.Foster (1981) 85Jones 67 The UFA had pledged during the election campaign to introduce prohibition in fact as well as in law, and the task fell to Brownlee. He initially cooled expectations by announcing that he had no interest in making \\"any hasty or ill-considered move\\", either in changing the law or altering enforcement of the existing one. The September 1922 murder of the Alberta Provincial Police's Steve Lawson marked a turning point in Alberta's prohibition policy. As Attorney-General, Brownlee aggressively prosecuted Emilio Picariello and Florence Lassandro for the murder. Both were hanged.On September 21, 1922, Constable Steve Lawson of the Alberta Provincial Police was murdered at his Blairmore home by bootlegger Emil Picariello and his companion Florence Lassandra.Foster (1981) 84 He was the third policeman killed in Alberta in liquor-related incidents in 1922. The murder opened up a rift between Albertans of British descent, who saw bootlegging as an affront to the rule of law even if they did not support prohibition, and Albertans of southern and eastern European descent, who found prohibition to be something of a joke and accepted bootlegging.Foster (1981) 83–84 Brownlee authorized the deployment of special constables to apprehend Picariello and Lassandra. Once they were arrested, he appeared personally at the prosecution's bench alongside A. A. McGillivray, reputedly Alberta's best courtroom lawyer, whose services he secured specifically for the case.Foster (1981) 85–86 Picariello and Lassandra were convicted and sentenced to death by hanging.Foster (1981) 86 By the time of their executions in May 1923, public opinion was turning against prohibition. The sentiment that criminal activities such as Picariello's were the inevitable result of prohibition laws became a popular one, as did the view that the government should legalize and regulate liquor sales.Jones 68 Brownlee, morally supportive of prohibition, began to personally support this course, believing that prohibition was unenforceable in the face of widespread public opposition.Foster (1981) 95 A 1923 referendum opted for the end of prohibition.Foster (1981) 100 In 1924 Brownlee guided the Government Liquor Control Act—drafted with the assistance of R. B. Bennett, who received $1,000 for his services—through the legislature. As Attorney-General, Brownlee was responsible for administration of the Lord's Day Act, which forbade most commerce on Sundays. Charles Huestis of the Lord's Day Alliance took issue with the Edmonton Orchestra's Sunday concerts, on the grounds that by opening them only to its subscription holders it was de facto charging admission, and that by paying its musicians honoraria it was gainfully employing them in their regular professions on Sundays. Brownlee declined to prosecute, since courts had previously held that the concerts were legal.Foster (1981) 66 Huestis retorted that as Attorney-General Brownlee should make them illegal, to which Brownlee responded that he fully appreciated the importance of the Sabbath and did not need to be lectured on the subject by Huestis. There were also complaints about farmers violating the act by working Sundays; Brownlee felt that such complaints were often more about conflicts between neighbours than preservation of the Sabbath, and prosecuted only the most gratuitous and flagrant cases.Foster (1981) 67 Political machinations and succession In the 1921 federal election, 65 of the House of Commons of Canada' 235 seats were won by Progressives and allied factions, including the UFA, which won both seats it contested.Foster (1981) 69 Liberal Prime Minister-designate William Lyon MacKenzie King had only a minority, and expected to rely on the support of these Progressives to govern. Progressive leader Thomas Crerar envisioned forming a coalition government with the Liberals, and knew that he would be expected to provide cabinet members from Alberta, which had been swept by Progressives and allied parties. Seeing no \\"cabinet material\\" among the elected members, he sent an emissary to Edmonton to convince Greenfield or Brownlee to enter federal politics. Brownlee refused and advised Greenfield to do the same, on the grounds that their abandonment of provincial politics soon after the UFA's election would be seen as a betrayal.Foster (1981) 70 As Greenfield's shortcomings became obvious, Brownlee found himself fielding propositions closer to home: in 1924 a group of UFA MLAs dissatisfied with Greenfield—including George Johnston, George MacLachlan, William Shield, Donald Cameron, Oran McPherson, and Austin Claypool—approached Brownlee to advise him that they planned to ask the premier to resign in favour of his attorney-general. To their surprise, Brownlee immediately told them that if Greenfield resigned, so would he. Faced with Brownlee's refusal to cooperate with their coup, the dissidents relented.Byrne 46 They made another attempt in 1925; Brownlee again threatened to resign, but this time was persuaded by Henry Wise Wood to accept the crown if Greenfield relinquished it willingly.Jones 71 Greenfield assured Brownlee that he had not wanted the job of premier in the first place and would happily see Brownlee take it from him. Faced with these assurances, Brownlee agreed to form a government, and became Premier of Alberta November 23, 1925.Foster (1981) 116 He remained Attorney-General until after the 1926 election, when he appointed the newly elected John Lymburn to replace him.

Suzanne is known as The Woman with a Parasol in Monet's painting of 1886. Early life In 1878 Monet and his family temporarily moved into the home of Ernest Hoschedé (1837–1891), a wealthy department store owner and patron of the arts. Both families then shared a house in Vétheuil during the summer. Hoschedé became bankrupt, and left in 1878 for Belgium. After the death of Monet's wife Camille in September 1879, and while Monet continued to live in the house in Vétheuil, Hoschedé's wife Alice (1844–1911) helped Monet to raise his two sons, Jean and Michel, by taking them to Paris to live alongside her own six children. They were Blanche Hoschedé Monet (who eventually married Jean Monet); Germaine; Suzanne Hoschedé; Marthe; Jean-Pierre; and Jacques. In the spring of 1880, Alice Hoschedé and all the children left Paris and rejoined Monet, still living in the house in Vétheuil.Charles Merrill Mount, Monet a biography, Simon & Schuster publisher, copyright 1966, pp.309-322.

In this system, the rider's action of depressing one of the brake levers applies both front and rear brakes. The amount of each brake applied may be determined by a proportional control valve. This is distinct from integrated brakes, where applying pressure to the rear brake pedal only applies some braking force to the front brake. The Motorcycle Safety Foundation, Basic RiderCourse Handbook Edition 1.0, page 34 Legal issues In the United States, the law requires a motorcycle to have two separate braking systems, although there is no special requirement that the systems have separate controls.https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/49/571.122 By contrast, a car is required to have only one braking system for dynamic braking (i.e. braking when moving), plus a separate parking brake. Examples of CBS BMW Motorrad uses a system called Integral ABS, in which the front brake lever operates both the front and rear brakes, while the brake pedal operates only the rear brake. In the inverse, Honda's system that features both combined brakes and anti-lock brakes is dubbed Combined ABS. In this system, the rear brake pedal operates both front and rear brake, and the front brake lever operates the front calipers, which in turn activates a secondary master cylinder to engage the rear brake. ABS modulators are installed on both the front and rear wheel. Honda’s first street motorcycle with a combined braking system (then called Unified Braking) was the 1983 GL1100. This system was derived from a 1970s RCB1000 world endurance race bike. Honda made several variations of the LBS system with differing levels of complexity and integration. The Honda CBR1000F and CBR1100XX and VFR800 featured what Honda called LBS II (now called Dual CBS), a system where both levers would activate both brakes through a system of secondary pistons and proportioning/delay valves. One front brake caliper was connected to a secondary master cylinder, and the caliper was allowed to rotate slightly to apply pressure to the piston in that secondary master cylinder. Braking force was translated into pressure that was sent to the rear brake cylinder. Only the two outer pistons in the front brake calipers were directly activated by the brake lever; the center piston received pressure from the rear pedal via the proportioning and delay valve.

A well-organized force of militia and regulars, under the capable leadership of famed Texas Ranger Col. John C. \\"Jack\\" Hays, defeated the Paiute warriors under Chief Numaga. This was the final engagement of the Pyramid Lake War of 1860. Background On May 6, 1860, a band of Paiutes raided Williams Station along the Carson River, near present-day Silver Springs, Nevada, killing three white settlers at the station. In response, Major William Ormsby led a group of vigilantes from Carson City and Virginia City against the Paiutes near Pyramid Lake. The vigilante force was ingloriously defeated and Ormsby was killed. This defeat prompted local settlers to send a call for help to nearby California. Prelude Colonel John C. Hays responded to the call and traveled to Carson City to organize a regiment of 500 volunteers, whom he dubbed the \\"Washoe Regiment\\". Another 165 volunteers came from the nearby California communities of Placerville, Sacramento, and Nevada City. Hays then marched his regiment to Virginia City. The U.S. Army also responded to the call. Captain Joseph Stewart left Fort Alcatraz with 144 Regulars from the 3rd U.S. Artillery and 6th U.S. Infantry regiments. Stewart arrived in Carson City to await further developments. In the meantime, Hays had marched out of Virginia City to Williams Station, where he skirmished with 150 Paiutes before the warriors pulled back to Pyramid Lake. The Paiutes returned to their village at Pyramid Lake near the mouth of the Truckee River. They sent their women and children into the Black Rock Desert as a protective measure. Battle Colonel \\"Jack\\" Hays led the volunteer forces. Colonel Hays retraced Ormsby's path along the Truckee River and encamped near present-day Wadsworth. There, Captain Stewart joined the volunteers with Colonel Hays in overall command. On June 2, the battle beganOnline Nevada Encyclopedia when Hays sent out an advance party of two companies, while the main force moved 8 miles downriver from their camp much more cautiously than Ormsby had before. The advance party, moving toward the Paiute village, encountered the remains of Ormsby's command on the previous battlefield that remained unburied. The Paiutes then made a rapid advance upon the soldiers in the shape of a wedge. The advance party made a hasty withdrawal. Colonel Hays selected an ideal location to make a stand. It was a narrow canyon, about a mile wide, anchored to the west by steep mountains of the Virginia Range. To the east ran the Truckee River. Both geographical features prevented any flanking maneuver by the natives. A rocky butte lay in the center of the field. To the west of this butte, rain had cut lateral gullies into the sandy ground, providing natural breastworks, which either side could have used to make successive stands in the case he was forced to retreat. Numaga was the Paiute high chief. The Paiute charge had taken possession of the butte and now extended their own line from the river well into the rocks of the mountains to the west. The Paiutes had advanced so quickly that all geographical features advantageous to the fight were now in their hands. The soldiers were forced to deploy on level ground to the south. Captain Stewart deployed his regulars in a skirmish line to the west of the butte along the base of the mountains, while the volunteers formed to the east along the river. Captain Edward Farris Storey and Captain J. B. Van Hagan, commanding two companies of volunteers from Virginia City and California, respectively, decided to make a charge against the butte even before Hays got the entire main force in place. Storey and Van Hagan succeeded in seizing the butte and for a short time were subjected to flanking fire as the natives began to surround them from the river bank and mountain slopes. This forward position was relieved as Hays advanced the main body forward. Stewart drove the warriors from the mountain slopes while Hays and the volunteers steadily advanced along the river. Eventually, the two sides maintained a continuous line of battle opposing each other roughly a mile long. The battle continued for some time, with neither side gaining a clear advantage. After fighting for nearly three hours, the Paiutes finally retreated up the canyon toward the lake. On June 4, Captain Stewart took up pursuit of the natives coming upon the abandoned village at the mouth of the Truckee River. Colonel Hays followed Stewart northward in pursuit. On June 5, Hays sent a group of scouts through a canyon northeast of Pyramid Lake. These scouts were ambushed and Private William Allen was killed. He was the last casualty of the war. Aftermath Fort Churchill was built in the aftermath of the battle. Shortly after Allen's death, Colonel Hays returned with the Washoe Regiment to Carson City, where he disbanded the regiment. Major Ormsby's body was temporarily interred where it lay near Pyramid Lake, but was later moved to a cemetery in Carson City. Captain Storey, who was mortally wounded in the battle, was buried in Virginia City. Both Ormsby and Storey had Nevada counties named after them.Maj William Ormsby Captain Stewart stayed in the Pyramid Lake area for a few more weeks, but the Paiutes never returned. His soldiers eventually built several earthen forts around the lake. Stewart abandoned these forts in favor of a larger fort along the Carson River. Stewart began construction in 1861 and named the post Fort Churchill. Battlefield The battle site is located within the Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation.

The subject matter Jain cosmology has a unique perception of the Universe. It perceives different solar and lunar entities in a manner that is different from the current cosmology as well those put forward by different cultures. According to Jain cosmology, this universe is an uncreated entity existing since beginningless time. The Universe is made up of what Jains call six dravya or reals or substances - Living beings, non-living things or matter, space, time and the principles of motion and rest. The universe itself is divided abode of gods, abode of humans and animals, and abode of hellish beings. Contents The Tiloya Panatti is a Prakrit work in the Jain Shauraseni dialect and has been composed primarily in the Arya metre. The work has a total of 5677 verses divided into 9 chapters. The chapter scheme is as under: #The Entire Universe (Loka) #The World of Hells (Naraka) #The World of Mansion-dwelling demigods (Bhuvanavasi) #The World of Humans (Manushya) #The World of Sub-human species - plants, animals, insects, etc. (Tiryanca) #The World of Peripatetic demigods #The World of Light #The World of Heavens #The World of the Siddhas - the liberated ones (Siddhashila) The Language and style The Jain Shauraseni used in this work would seem to suggest that this work predates the Western recensions of the Agamas that took place in Valabhi in the 6th century CE. In addition to cosmology, this work sheds light on Jain dogmatics, culture, history, mythology and ascetic lineages. Of the 5677 gathas, most are in the Arya metre, but other metres such as Shardulavikridita, Vasantatilaka, Indravajra, Dodhaka, Svagata and Malini have also been used. Apart from the gathas, there are several long passages in prose. The authorship Acharya Yativrshabha authored the Tiloya Panatti in seventh century CE. He is known for his important commentary on the Kasayapahuda, (Treatise on Passions), which is dated in the early centuries of the Common Era. Hence it is speculated that Acharya Yativrshabha belonged to 4-5th century CE.

The West Valley Facility was mothballed for future use in the event of increases in the population of detained youth. It was repurposed for use as an adult day reporting center following the passage of AB 109 Realignment in October 2011. =Community Corrections Bureau= This bureau operates the Juvenile and Adult Services Divisions: Adult Services *Adult Investigations Probation Officers conduct investigations and prepare reports upon referral by the Court. Referrals cover, but are not limited to, such areas as pre- and post-sentence investigations and recommendations, pre-plea recommendations, violations of probation, eligibility for drug diversion, credit for time served, reductions of previously entered pleas, early termination from probation, restitution and miscellaneous issues about which the Court might require information. *Adult Supervision The Probation Officers primary function is to make contact with probationers in the community and at their homes. Officers in this unit ensure that probationers comply with their probation terms. This may include serving weekend custody time, community service, paying restitution, and attending counseling programs. *Diversion Program PC 1000 The goal of this program is to allow the \\"less serious\\" drug offender the opportunity to avoid conviction by taking advantage of counseling, education and other treatment options. Successful completion of the program results in the charges being dismissed. *Drug Court This is an intense drug treatment program also designed for those convicted of less serious drug offenses. The program includes frequent drug testing, judicial and probation supervision, drug counseling and educational opportunities. In determining suitability for the program, the Judge, the Probation Officer and the attorneys consider factors such as the length of drug usage, familial support and desire for change. *Mental Health Court This specialized program diverts mentally impaired offenders from the criminal justice system to highly trained mental health teams who provide close supervision. Participants are required to attend 8-hour counseling programs, five days a week. The Probation Officer interviews candidates, consults with mental health professionals and provides the Court with applicable terms and conditions of probation. *Domestic Violence Court This specialized unit supervises offenders convicted of domestic violence charges. This unit provides close supervision of domestic violence offenders and ensures that offenders attend their court mandated domestic violence classes. *Sex Offender Unit This specialized unit closely supervises offenders convicted of sexual offenses. *Gang Unit This specialized unit closely supervises gang members who have been convicted of crimes. *Welfare Fraud Probation Officers in this unit focus on the full repayment of restitution and impose other measures that treat identified problems. Offenders who are unemployed or attending school are referred to the Employee Development Department for employment assistance. Frequent contact with the Department of Human Social Services is made to ensure compliance and reconcile offenders’ accounts. Juvenile Services *Juvenile Investigations Probation Officers conduct investigations and prepare reports upon referral by the Court. Referrals cover, but are not limited to, such areas as pre- and post-dispositional investigations and recommendations, violations of probation, restitution and miscellaneous issues about which the Court might require information. *After Care This is an intensive supervision program for minors graduating from out-of-home placements. These minors require intensive supervision and services to provide for a successful transition back into the community. Probation Officers monitor those with whom the ward associates, curfew compliance and school attendance. *CST Probation Officers in this unit supervise minors placed on informal probation by the Juvenile Court. Officers set up contracts with each minor for a six-month period. Minors are referred to counseling programs as appropriate, contact is maintained with the family, and restitution is collected during that period. *School Probation Officers This unit is composed of Probation Officers who are each assigned to an elementary, middle or high school campus. They work primarily with at-risk youth, identifying students with behavior problems and referring them for counseling. Probation Officers may conduct classes on subjects such as conflict resolution and anger management or address truancy issues. *Gang Resistance and Education This unit is composed of Probation Officers who are assigned to teach the G.R.E.A.T. program in elementary and middle schools. G.R.E.A.T. stands for Gang Resistance Education and Training. *House Arrest Program This unit is composed of Probation Officers who are assigned to perform home visits on minors to ensure they are cooperating with their house arrest terms and conditions. *Youth Accountability Board This is a community based diversion program designed to provide first time misdemeanor offenders with preventative services through a partnership with community volunteers. Volunteers monitor community service progress and school behavior, then report back to the Probation Officer upon successful completion or failure in the program. *Placement Probation Officers in this unit are assigned to specific placement programs and conduct monthly visits to the juveniles placed at those facilities by the Juvenile Court. These juveniles have been removed from their homes for their own welfare and for the protection of the community. These settings are highly structured treatment- oriented environments that provide specific counseling and educational needs and are under twenty-four-hour supervision. Probation Officers monitor progress and submit recommendations to the court regarding the minor's readiness to return home. *P.R.I.D.E. PRIDE is a nine to twelve-month community-based program that treats high-risk substance abusers, on probation, who desire to overcome their addictions. The goal is to address the multi- faceted problems of the chemically dependent criminal population. Treatment includes comprehensive probation supervision, weekly drug testing, random searches, intensive individual and group counseling sessions and regular participation in Narcotics Anonymous. The program also offers parenting and anger management classes, educational counseling, job referrals and residential care, if necessary.

Thomson (1921–1984) was a British philosopher who devised the puzzle of Thomson's lamp, to argue against the possibility of supertasks (a word he also coined). Academic career Thomson was born in London in 1921 and graduated from the University of London in 1949. He was an assistant in the Department of Philosophy, and John Stuart Mill Scholar at University College, London, from 1949-1950\\\\. He was Commonwealth Fund Fellow at Harvard and Princeton from 1950-1951; assistant lecturer at University College from 1951-1953 and University Lecturer in Moral Science at the University of Cambridge from 1953-1956\\\\. Thomson was appointed Fellow and Tutor in Philosophy, Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in 1956, and also University Lecturer at Columbia University. He was visiting professor at Columbia from 1961-1962, and in 1963 he was appointed professor of philosophy at MIT. Family life In 1962 he married the American philosopher Judith Jarvis Thomson. They separated in 1976 and divorced in 1980; they remained colleagues until James Thomson’s death in 1984. Thomson's lamp In a seminal 1954 article which followed on from the work of Max Black,Black, M. \\"Achilles and the Tortoise\\". Analysis XI (1950-51), pp. 91-101. Thomson considered the successful completion of an infinite number of tasks within a given time, to which he gave the name supertasks. To disprove the possibility of supertasks, he introduced Thomson's lamp, a thought experiment similar to Zeno's paradoxes. This problem involves the mathematical summation of an infinite divergent series such as Grandi's. A lamp (which may be on or off at the start of the thought-experiment) is flicked on and off an infinite number of times within a 2-minute period. This corresponds to the ordered sequence t=0, t=0.5, t=0.75, t=0.875, ... According to Thomson, although the lamp must be either on or off at the end of the experiment when t=1, the state of the lamp - after an infinite number of switches - is also completely undetermined (i.e. the sequence has no limit). This apparent contradiction led him to reject the possibility of the experiment, and therefore the possibility of supertasks. However, Paul Benacerraf in a 1962 paperBenacerraf, Paul. \\"Tasks, super-tasks, and modern eleatics\\", Journal of Philosophy LIX (1962), pp.765-784. successfully criticised Thomson's argument, by pointing out that the states of the lamp during the experiment do not logically determine the final state of the lamp when t=1. Thomson's conditions for the experiment are insufficiently complete, since only instants of time before t≡1 are considered. Benacerraf's essay led to a renewed interest in infinity-related problems, set theory and the foundation of supertask theory. Selected bibliography *A note on truth.

He was invited back to Britain in 1897 to engineer the difficult approaches of the Great Central Railway to a new terminus at London (Marylebone). Origins Edmund Wragge was the second son of seven children born to Charles John and Frances Anne Wragge of Red Hill House, Old Swinford, near Stourbridge, Worcestershire. Wragge's parents were cousins, married at Oakamoor, Cheadle, Staffordshire. Their families were prosperous lawyers and bankers in the English Midlands, although with engineering and manufacturing connections. Ingleby & Wragge, Solicitors of New Street, Birmingham, handled some of the legal business of Boulton and Watt. The Worcestershire Wragges were lawyers and bankers. Charles John Wragge was an attorney who in 1835 became a partner in Rufford's Bank, Stourbridge with Francis Rufford, a railway financier, Member of Parliament, and speculator. In 1851 the bank suffered a liquidity crisis as a result of Rufford's speculations, and failed. All the assets were sold in 1852, including Red Hill House. Edmund Wragge was 15 years of age at the time and the impact of these events must have been considerable. Wragge was educated at Rossall School on the Lancashire coast. When he was seventeen, in about 1853, he commenced his engineering career as a pupil with Messrs. Fox, Henderson and Company, London Works, Smethwick. John Henderson, the Scottish-born ironmaster, is said to have been a friend of Wragge's father. After the partnership between Fox and Henderson was wound up in the mid-1850s Wragge completed his pupilage in London with Sir Charles Fox and Son, until he was about twenty-two years of age in 1858. A position with Fox, the celebrated engineer of the Crystal Palace housing the Great Exhibition of 1851, would have required payment of a substantial premium.Personal communication with Mrs Ann Mitchell, North Hatley, Quebec. Great-great-granddaughter of Edmund Wragge. Career =South Africa= In 1859 Wragge went to South Africa where he remained for three and a half years as a district engineer on the construction of the Cape Town and Wellington Railway. The consultant engineer of the proposed line was Sir Charles Fox, who had submitted an estimated cost of £500,000 in 1851. The line was built by the Cape Town Railway and Dock Company, which was incorporated in London in 1853, with a concession to build a line from Cape Town to Wellington. Wragge was responsible, under a resident engineer, for work on 14 miles of the line. It is likely that it was a part of the line near Stellenbosch, where the railway arrived in 1862, for he married Lucy Eliza Carlyon, the sixteen and a half year old daughter of a Cornish Anglican clergyman there in November 1861. The railway was completed to Wellington in 1863. =England= Wragge then returned to England with his wife, and for a year (1862–63) he was an assistant engineer on the London, Chatham and Dover Railway. Then for the three years between 1863 and 1866, he became resident engineer in charge of the reconstruction of the approaches from Battersea to Victoria Station, for the London Chatham & Dover, the London Brighton & South Coast, and the London & South Western Railways. Sir Charles Fox & Sons engineered this complex scheme of high level lines at Battersea, and the widening of the railway bridge over the Thames. During this period he prepared a proposal (one of several between 1850 and 1900), for a light railway in the Rother Valley of Sussex. Plans and documents developed by Sir Charles Fox and Edmund Wragge were deposited on 30 November 1865. The line was not built until 1900 when it was constructed by Colonel Fred Stephens as the Rother Valley Railway, the first of the notoriously uneconomic light railway projects that Stephens engineered. Later it became the Kent and East Sussex Railway, parts of which are now a preserved steam railway line. In 1866 Wragge went into practice on his own account for three years, during which time he was resident engineer on the works of the Waterloo & Whitehall Railway. This was to have been a short pneumatic tube railway in a 12 ft 9 in diameter cast iron tube under the River Thames, driven by an atmospheric engine. The line obtained an enabling act in 1865.Acts of the Parliaments of the United Kingdom; Part 57 (1865b) 1865 (28 & 29 Vic.) c.cclviii, Waterloo & Whitehall Ry Some tube was laid in a trench on the bed of the river, but the project was abandoned in 1868, due to the financial crisis following the failure of the Overend and Gurney railway investment bank. Part of the route is now incorporated in the Bakerloo line of the London Underground. =Costa Rica= His relationship with Sir Charles continued when Fox asked him to go to Costa Rica in December 1868, to make a survey for a narrow gauge railway across the country from the Atlantic to the Pacific Coast. On the basis of the survey, Sir Charles Fox and Sons were to submit a bid to construct the line. Wragge took along his brother in law, Leonard Carlyon, as his assistant. After a long and difficult journey by steamer to Panama, by rail across the Isthmus, another steamer to the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, followed by several days in a mule train to the capital, San José, he was devastated to find that American contractors had beaten him by two weeks, and scooped up the contract. After fruitless negotiations to try to upset the provisional contract, Wragge and Carlyon set off back to England, but both contracted fever in Panama, from which Carlyon died on board ship and was buried in Jamaica. =Membership of the Institution of Civil Engineers= In 1869 Wragge applied for membership of the Institution of Civil Engineers, which was granted in January 1870. He was sponsored by Sir Charles Fox, and his candidate circular provides not only details of his career, but also an insight into Wragge's lengthy list of seconders from the railway industry, including some distinguished proponents of the narrow gauge such as Sir Henry Whatley Tyler, HM's chief inspector of railways. =Canada= On his return from Costa Rica, Wragge's letters indicate that he worked on a project in the English Midlands for some months until Sir Charles Fox secured for him the position of chief engineer of the Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway (TG&BR;), and the Toronto and Nipissing Railway (T&NR;) in July 1869. This placement must have been settled by telegram, because Douglas Fox left Toronto on 27 July 1869, promising to have an engineer sent out, and Edmund Wragge departed for Norway to see Pihl's narrow gauge railways on 1 August 1869. Wragge arrived in Toronto in September 1869 and between that time and late 1874 he engineered and constructed over 280 route miles of the 3 ft 6 in gauge railways, at a total cost of £900,000. The railways were built economically as a practical means of opening up the interior of the province of Ontario to settlement. When the T&NR; commenced operation to Uxbridge in June 1871, it was the first public passenger carrying narrow gauge railway in North America, and attracted several visits from American engineers who were interested in constructing similar railways. At the first National Narrow Gauge Convention, in St. Louis, in June 1872, Wragge was asked to speak on his experiences, and was appointed to the central executive committee. Wragge's railways were technically innovative in their motive power, using large ‘Fairlie’ articulated types for freight haulage; and purchasing numbers of powerful and successful British 4-6-0 types, 24 years before such locomotives were first accepted in Britain (on the Highland Railway in 1894). Wragge described the railways in two technical papers, written for the Institution of Civil Engineers. In 1875, he gave up his position with the T&NR; in order to become the general manager of the TG&BR;, and the respect he had earned is reflected publicly in the minutes of the T&NR; Annual General Meeting of that year. At the TG&BR;, Wragge oversaw the gauge conversion of the line to standard gauge. Wragge was appointed Toronto area manager for the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) on 8 October 1883, by the general manager, Joseph Hickson. In 1891 Wragge was elected as vice president of the Ontario and Sault Ste Marie Railway. Wragge was well known to Sir Henry Tyler, by then president of the GTR. By the 1880s the 2nd Union Station at Toronto, completed in 1873, was becoming inadequate, and more tracks and a larger station building were needed. Wragge was the chief engineer and head of construction for this expansion, which was completed in 1895. Wragge returned occasionally to Britain during this period and a letter in his 1883 correspondence indicates that he was working there with Sir Charles Fox and Sons on negotiations for the building of the Quebec North Shore Railway. Sir William Cornelius Van Horne, the president of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) asked Wragge in 1888 to act as an arbitrator in compensation negotiations between the CPR and the Canadian government. =Return to England= His work on the rebuilding of Union Station and continued association with Douglas Fox led to his return to Britain, at the age of 60, in 1896, to participate in the building of the last main line into Central London, that of the Great Central Railway. Construction of this heavily engineered connection commenced in late 1894, of which the most difficult part was to drive a mainline railway through the London suburbs to a terminus at Marylebone. This was the section for which Sir Charles Fox and Sons were the consultants. Edmund Wragge was the resident engineer from 1897 to 1899 and lived in the St Marylebone district, close to the construction works. The completion of the line in March 1899, was marked by the presentation of several technical papers to the Institution of Civil Engineers. G. A. Hobson and Edmund Wragge gave a lengthy and detailed paper in November 1900, describing the engineering and construction of the approaches to Marylebone Station. The Institution Of Civil Engineers awarded Wragge and Hobson the Telford Medal and premiums for this work. Hobson is credited with the design of the great railway bridge of 1905 over the Zambezi River at Victoria Falls. Death Edmund Wragge returned to Canada in 1904, and was in private practice until he retired in 1914. He died in Toronto, on 26 November 1929, aged 93.

It premiered on the Fox network on December 9, 2009. The episode was written and directed by series co-creator Brad Falchuk, and serves as the mid-season finale for the show's first season. \\"Sectionals\\" sees the glee club win the sectionals round of competition, advancing on to regionals. Glee club member Finn (Cory Monteith) discovers he is not the father of his girlfriend Quinn's (Dianna Agron) baby. Football coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher) plans his wedding with Emma (Jayma Mays) on the same day as the sectionals competition. Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) is unable to take the students to sectionals and Emma offers to take them. The episode sees the return of Eve and Michael Hitchcock as rival glee club directors Grace Hitchens and Dalton Rumba. The episode features covers of six songs, studio recordings of four of which were released as singles, available for digital download, and are also included on the album Glee: The Music, Volume 2. \\"Sectionals\\" was watched by 8.127 million U.S. viewers, and received mostly positive reviews from critics. The episode's musical performances attracted praise, as did the development of Will and Emma's relationship, though Dan Snierson of Entertainment Weekly suggested it may have been preferable to leave their romance unresolved. James Poniewozik of Time felt that by concluding the pregnancy storyline in \\"Sectionals\\", Glee was able to \\"clear the decks for a second half of the season as the confident show it now is\\". Plot As a result of a technicality in the show choir competition rules, glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) is not allowed to accompany New Directions to sectionals. Guidance counsellor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) postpones her own wedding by a few hours so that she can take the club in his place, although her fiancé, football coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher), feels she is choosing Will over him. Most of the glee club has learned that Puck (Mark Salling), not Finn (Cory Monteith), is the father of Quinn's baby. They hide this fact from Rachel (Lea Michele), believing that she will tell Finn. Emma takes over as faculty advisor of the club as they start working on their set list for sectionals. With two group songs selected, Rachel says that she'll sing the solo ballad; Mercedes (Amber Riley) strenuously objects to this, and sings \\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\" to wild applause. Rachel agrees that Mercedes deserves to sing the solo and the two hug. Meanwhile, Rachel has deduced that Puck impregnated Quinn and tells Finn; he punches Puck and confronts Quinn, who tearfully admits the truth. Angered by their betrayal, Finn quits the club on the eve of sectionals, and has to be replaced by school reporter Jacob Ben Israel (Josh Sussman). New Directions arrive at the event to discover their competitors have received an advance copy of their set list, and are performing all three of their chosen songs. Emma calls Will, who convinces Finn to help his New Directions teammates. Will finds Finn in the locker room, and talks to him about how special he is and that the club needs him. Emma confronts rival choir directors Grace Hitchens (Eve) and Dalton Rumba (Michael Hitchcock), while New Directions chooses new performance pieces for their set list at the last minute. Rachel asks Mercedes to perform another ballad, but Mercedes insists, with the rest of the club agreeing, that Rachel is the best choice to perform \\"on the fly\\". They also decide to include \\"Somebody to Love\\" as their closer, but are stuck for a third piece until Finn arrives with new sheet music for the group, ready to perform with them. Rachel gives a solo performance of \\"Don't Rain on My Parade\\", receiving a standing ovation after finishing. The group then performs \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" by the Rolling Stones, to the applause and cheers of the audience. After their performance, Grace attempts to confess her duplicity to the judges, but they have already unanimously decided that New Directions has won the competition. Will angrily confronts Sue and promises he will damage her for all the trouble she has caused. Having previously discovered that his wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) was faking her pregnancy, Will tells her he no longer feels the same way he did when they first fell in love. He later attends Ken and Emma's delayed wedding, only to find that Ken has ended the relationship as a result of Emma's feelings for Will. She announces her intention to leave McKinley High School, explaining that it will be too painful for her to carry on working with Will and Ken. Back at school, Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) suspends cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) for leaking the glee club's set list, and has Will reinstated as the director of New Directions. The glee club members show Will their trophy and perform \\"My Life Would Suck Without You\\" for him. The dance moves in the finale are a combination of the dances from other songs that have been performed so far. As Emma prepares to leave the school, Will chases after her and stops her with a kiss. Both are happy, but uncertain of what will happen next. Production Glee was originally commissioned by Fox for a thirteen episode run, culminating with \\"Sectionals\\". On September 21, 2009, the network announced an extension of the first season, ordering a further nine episodes. \\"Sectionals\\" therefore serves as the mid-season finale, with the remainder of the season airing from April 13, 2010. Events in \\"Sectionals\\" are influenced by the season's eleventh episode \\"Hairography\\", in which cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester gave New Directions' competition set-list to their rival glee clubs. Morrison explained that the clubs perform New Directions' songs first, making it appear that they are copying them, so New Directions \\"have to do this impromptu thing and fly by the seat of [their] pants.\\" Morrison has called \\"Sectionals\\" \\"the best episode\\" of the series. \\"Sectionals\\" was written and directed by series creator Brad Falchuk. Recurring characters who appear in the episode are glee club members Brittany (Heather Morris), Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera), Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.) and Matt Rutherford (Dijon Talton), football coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher), school reporter Jacob Ben Israel (Josh Sussman), Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) and local news anchor Rod Remington (Bill A. Jones). Anna Camp and Patricia Forte guest star as sectionals judges Candace Dykstra and Donna Landries, Peter Choi is the Emcee, and Thomasina Gross plays Perfect Engleberger, a member of the Jane Addams Academy glee club. \\"Sectionals\\" also sees the return of Eve and Michael Hitchcock as rival glee club directors Grace Hitchens and Dalton Rumba. Eve was offered the role of Grace after Whitney Houston declined to appear. The episode features cover versions of \\"Don't Rain on My Parade\\" by Barbra Streisand, \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" by The Rolling Stones, \\"My Life Would Suck Without You\\" by Kelly Clarkson, \\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\" from Dreamgirls, \\"Don't Stop Believin' by Journey and \\"Proud Mary\\" by Creedence Clearwater Revival. Studio recordings of \\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\", \\"Don't Rain on My Parade\\", \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" and \\"My Life Would Suck Without You\\" were released as singles in December 2009, available for download. They are also included on the album Glee: The Music, Volume 2. \\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\" charted at number 85 in Canada and 94 in the US, while \\"Don't Rain on My Parade\\" charted at number 59 in Canada and 53 in the US. \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" charted at number 51 in Canada and 71 in the US, and \\"My Life Would Suck Without You\\" charted at number 66 in Australia, 40 in Canada and 51 in the US. Jenna Ushkowitz named \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" one of her favorite songs on the album, deeming the original \\"a classic\\" and the Glee cover \\"emotional\\" as one of the final songs of the original run of episodes. The performance of \\"My Life Would Suck Without You\\" showcased choreography from numerous performances from earlier episodes. Reception The kiss between Emma (Mays, pictured) and Will in \\"Sectionals\\" was generally well-received, though Entertainment Weekly Dan Snierson felt it may have come too soon. The episode was watched by 8.127 million US viewers. It was the show's highest-rated episode ever with teenagers, and its season high in the 18-49 demographic, with a rating/share of 3.7/9. In Canada, it was the tenth most watched show for the week of broadcast, attaining 1.64 million viewers. \\"Sectionals\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. TV Guide Natalie Abrams felt it ended the beginning of the season on a \\"high note\\", while Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal commented: \\"You couldn’t have asked for a better cliffhanger of a fall finale\\". IGN's Eric Goldman rated the episode 9/10, calling it \\"very satisfying\\", and Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times commended it as \\"fine television.\\" James Poniewozik of Time wrote: \\"I'm not sure I expected or wanted a feel-good ending out of the first half of Glee. But what we got from \\"Sectionals\\" left me feeling very good about where the show is going this spring.\\" In contrast, Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger, felt that the episode brought too many storylines to a head at once, \\"not allowing all to have as much impact as they might have had the big developments been spaced out\\". Sepinwall commented, however, that the acting and especially singing performances were \\"uniformly strong.\\" Musical performances in the episode attracted praise. Aly Semigran of MTV called Riley's rendition of \\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\" \\"goose bump-inducing\\", while Goldman commended: \\"Riley absolutely killed it as Mercedes belted out that song\\". In contrast, Poniewozik wrote that it was the one song choice he didn't like, feeling that it is overused, thus diminishing its impact. Abrams deemed Rachel's solo performance at sectionals \\"amazing\\", and Flandez recommended: \\"Watch it again if you ever want to take back three minutes of your life that you’ve wasted on something else.\\" Pardue called the group performance of \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" \\"energetic [...] casual [...] and very Glee\\", but felt it \\"would have been nice\\" to feature different singers. Dan Snierson for Entertainment Weekly similarly noted that he would have preferred \\"more vocal interplay between all group members\\". In December 2012, TV Guide named the rendition of \\"Don't Rain on My Parade\\" one of Glee best performances, commenting: \\"Glee has done Broadway many times, but rarely better than this.\\" Critics also commented positively on the development of Will and Emma's relationship, with Abrams noting that she had been waiting for them to kiss since the pilot episode, and Goldman deeming their coming together \\"very hard to not feel good about\\". Snierson, however, wrote that although there was satisfaction in the episode ending on the kiss, it may have been \\"more intriguing\\" to conclude with Will finding Emma's office empty, questioning whether it was too soon for the two of them to begin a relationship. The end of Quinn's pregnancy secret was also well received. Poniewozik wrote that the pregnancy storyline had felt as though \\"the early Glee wasn't confident that people would be interested in it without these over-the-top soap opera twists.\\" He noted that in concluding the pregnancy deception in \\"Sectionals\\", Glee: \\"seemed to clear the decks for a second half of the season as the confident show it now is.\\" References External links * \\"Sectionals\\" at Fox.com \\"Sectionals\\" at TV.com 2009 American television episodes Glee (season 1) episodes Television episodes written by Brad Falchuk ","title":"Sectionals (Glee)"},{"id":"25054617","text":"The 1981 Texas Tech Red Raiders football team represented Texas Tech University in the Southwest Conference (SWC) during the 1981 NCAA Division I-A football season.

The commune is located northeast of Bălți. Population Its population includes survivors of a generation that migrated west from Bessarabia in 1940 when the USSR occupied Bessarabia under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany. More Bessarabians migrated to what is now the Alexăndreni Commune when Romania lost the territory again in 1944 after recapturing it in 1941.Nation-Building and Contested Identities: Romanian and Hungarian Case Studies. Balázs Trencsényi, Regio Books, Budapest 2001 Economy The Commune is primarily an agricultural area, with a per capita GDP (PPP) of approximately $2300. One of its major employers is Südzucker Moldova SA, the top sugar beet producer in Moldova. The company, which operates 3 sugar factories in Moldova, regards its Alexăndreni sugar factory as its most logistically advanced. The firm's Alexăndreni agro- technical fleet automated agricultural processes in adjacent sugar beet fields at subsidized rates, yielding increased output from 17.9 metric tons per hectare (15.9 tons per acre) in 2003 to 42.0 t/ha (37.5 tons per acre) in 2008. Its technology spans from seed selection and management, soil fertilization and cultivation, to mechanized harvesting.Südzucker Moldova SA website (English) Energy Alexăndreni Commune's energy supply, like that of the rest of the Republic of Moldova, depends almost totally (98%) from energy supply from outside its borders. The small amount generated internally includes electricity generated, in part, by a combined heat power (CHP) plant in North Bălţi. The CHP North-Bălți, with an installed capacity of 28 MW and an available power of 24 MW was put into operation in 1960. The CHP's of the region's sugar factories also serve as seasonal energy sources, and the sugar factory plant in Alexăndreni provides approximately 12 MW. These CHP's were put into operation between the years of 1956-1985, with an installed estimated capacity of about 20 MW. Thermal power is also generated by a municipal thermal power plant operating as an autonomous operating unit in North Bălți. The main fuel for this plant is natural gas, and the reserve one is residual fuel oil. The wear degree of the equipment is about 60%.

Ethiopia became the first African Chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum during the CVF High-Level Climate Policy Forum held in the Senate of the Philippines on 15 August 2016.> The Philippines was the Chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum during the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris (COP21) and oversaw the adoption of the body’s Manila-Paris Declaration at the Third High-Level Meeting of the Forum on 30 November 2015. The Manila-Paris Declaration articulated the common concerns and commitments of vulnerable countries and urged the strengthening of the UNFCCC goal of limiting warming to below 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. During this meeting the membership of the Climate Vulnerable Forum expanded to include 23 new members. In 2015, the twenty member countries in a forum chaired by the Philippines launched the official bloc of the forum, the 'V20' or 'Vulnerable Twenty', consisting of the top 20 nations from all over the world that are most affected by the catastrophes rooted from climate change. The members of the bloc are Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Barbados, Bhutan, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Kiribati, Madagascar, Maldives, Nepal, Philippines, Rwanda, Saint Lucia, Tanzania, Timor-Leste, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Vietnam.

Formation  The CVF was founded by the Maldives government before the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, which sought to increase awareness of countries considered vulnerable. Eleven governments from Africa, Asia, the Americas and the Pacific, representing the countries most vulnerable to climate change, met near the Maldives capital of Malé in November 2009. The governments issued a declaration expressing alarm at the pace of change and damage as a result of global warming, stating that these conditions are \\"an existential threat to our nations, our cultures and to our way of life\\" and \\"undermine the internationally-protected human rights of our people\\". A group of countries which emit small amounts of greenhouse gases enacted the CVF declaration, pledging to lead the world to a low-carbon (and, ultimately, carbon-neutral) economy. The CVF recognized the need for international support to achieve these objectives in vulnerable countries. A number of these countries’ leaders, including Maldives President Mohamed Nasheed, are key figures in the CVF. The vulnerable countries received significant media attention at the Copenhagen summit, where they were involved in closed-door negotiations with leaders of the United States and China. The CVF Declaration committed to achieve a concentration of no more than 350 ppm (parts per million) of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere and limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (or less) above preindustrial levels. This position was later adopted by the Alliance of Small Island States. Antigua, Barbuda, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, the Marshall Islands and Samoa also followed Maldives as developing countries committed to low-carbon development or carbon neutrality.  Development  =Maldives= The founding countries pledged to demonstrate moral leadership and work towards a green economy by committing to carbon neutrality. They called upon all countries to follow the moral leadership of Maldives, the first country to pledge to achieve carbon neutrality. Maldives held an underwater cabinet meeting on the dangers of the current sea level rise, and was the CVF's first chair from 2009 to 2010. =Kiribati= Kiribati was the second chair of the CVF, from 2010 to 2011. It hosted the Tarawa Climate Change Conference on November 9–11, 2010, where the Ambo Declaration was signed by 12 countries: Kiribati, the Solomon Islands, Tonga, the Republic of the Maldives, Cuba, Brazil, Fiji, Japan, China, the Marshall Islands, New Zealand and Australia. In May 2013 a follow-up statement about the 2010 conference and the agreements reached there was made, indicating disappointment and asking if focusing on two new provisions (greenhouse gas emissions and climate change) would better serve their goals. =Bangladesh= Bangladesh was the third chair of the CVF, from 2011 to 2013. Its government hosted a ministerial meeting of the forum on November 13–14, 2011 in Dhaka, where Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon were keynote speakers at its inauguration ceremony. Nineteen climate-vulnerable countries supported the Declaration,http://daraint.org/wp- content/uploads/2011/11/Dhaka.Declaration.pdf and it was adopted in Dhaka on November 14, 2011. =Costa Rica= Costa Rica took over as CVF chair from Bangladesh in mid-2013. The CVF adopted an Action Plan under the Costa Rica presidency for the 2013-15 period. This Action Plan was released at the UN Climate Change Conference at Warsaw, Poland (COP19) in November 2013, and includes cooperative action of vulnerable countries across six different multilateral sectors, including finance, health, human rights, labour and migration, mandating new research, high-level consultations and diplomatic activities.http://www.dhakatribune.com/environment/2013/nov/20/green-climate- fund-moves-forward =Philippines= The CVF was chaired by Senator Loren Legarda of the Philippines. The Philippines took over responsibility as CVF chair from Costa Rica in January 2015 and will continue to preside the Forum until mid-2016. In 2015, the chair announced the official launching of the 'Vulnerable Twenty' or 'V20' as a more comprehensive offshoot bloc from the established forum. The Philippines highlighted the importance of finance in climate change. The 'V20' was officially launched by all member countries in the city of Lima in Peru(a non-member country which also handled come meetings in the 2015 APEC). The chairmanship of the Philippines coincided with its chairmanship of APEC, which created a much prepared mechanism for the flow and handling of the forum.http://www.thecvf.org/new-cvf-chair-philippines-lead- global-forum-vulnerable-countries/ Under the presidency of the Philippines, the CVF adopted the Manila-Paris Declaration and the 2016-2018 Roadmap at the Third High-Level Meeting of the CVF held during COP21. The Manila-Paris Declaration articulated the common concerns and commitments of vulnerable countries and urged the strengthening of the UNFCCC goal of limiting warming to below 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The country of Palau became a member of the forum after being endorsed by the Philippines. = Ethiopia = Ethiopia was confirmed as the incoming chair of the CVF at the Third High-Level Meeting of the CVF held during the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris (COP21).  Membership  Forty-three governments have participated in the CVF from key developing regions around the world.http://www.thecvf.org/web/about/participating-countries/ In 2009, the following countries adopted its first declaration: Bangladesh, Barbados, Bhutan, Ghana, Kenya, Kiribati, Maldives, Nepal, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Vietnamhttp://daraint.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Declaration-of-the-CVF- FINAL2.pdf Two years later, the following countries adopted its second declaration: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Kiribati, Madagascar, Maldives, Nepal, Philippines, Rwanda, Saint Lucia, Tanzania, Timor-Leste, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and Vietnam. At the Third High Level Meeting of the CVF held during COP21 the membership of the Forum increased to include the following twenty-three new members: Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Comoros, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Dominican Republic, Fiji, Grenada, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Malawi, Marshall Islands, Mongolia, Morocco, Niger, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Senegal, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Tunisia and Yemen. Observer states have included Australia, China, Denmark, the European Union, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Qatar, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States.  Institutional support  In September 2012, the CVF established a trust fund administered by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).http://mptf.undp.org/factsheet/fund/CVF00 United Nations agencies collaborate in implementing activities linked to the CVF with the UNDP, the lead organization supporting the forum's work. DARA, an independent, nonprofit organization based in Madrid, had previously provided institutional support to the CVF.http://daraint.org/climate-vulnerabililty-initiative/  Climate Vulnerability Monitor  Mohamed Nasheed, President of the Maldives, at the introduction of the Climate Vulnerability Monitor The CVF and DARA published the Climate Vulnerability Monitor, \\"The State of the Climate Crisis,\\" in December 2010. The global study covered 184 countries affected by the short-term impacts of climate change in four key areas: health, weather disasters, habitat loss and economic stress. A second edition of the Climate Vulnerability Monitor, \\"A Guide to the Cold Calculus of a Hot Planet\\", was published in September 2012. It expanded on the first report’s analysis, describing 34 indicators of positive and negative effects predicted to result from climate change.Georgetown Climate Center  Discussion  The purpose of the CVF is to channel input from the most vulnerable groups, creating new policies and promoting effective action on climate change as it evolves. The forum is recognized as a voice on international climate-change issues. The forum's latest Climate Vulnerability Monitor specifies the costs and benefits of addressing climate change instead of continuing current trends in the globally fossil fuel-intensive economic pathway. Its analysis relies on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) greenhouse gas emission projections and studies showing carbon-intensive energy means indicating 10-100 times the level of negative externalities when compared to climate-safe alternatives. Scholarly discussion of climate vulnerability and the meaning of vulnerability itself is more subjective, leading to a separate (but closely linked) debate. There are clear discrepancies in how different countries deal with climate change, leading to dissent about how the issue should be handled at the international level. A question is, \\"Are countries with better economic standing responsible for helping less privileged countries deal with climate change?\\" According to a spokesperson for the Climate and Development Knowledge Network, climate vulnerability is an issue of \\"equity and human rights\\" determined by climate change’s effect on a given nation's environment and the level of that nation’s preparedness and available resources to deal with its challenges.

Before the chiflik system the Empire used a non-hereditary form of land management called the Timar System. Starting as the Empire began to collapse, powerful military officers started to claim land from the Sultan's holding allowing them to pass the land onto their sons thus creating the Chiflik system. This form of land management lasted from the sixteenth century to the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in 1919. Background In the Ottoman Empire before the Chiflik system was adopted the Timar system was official Ottoman policy. The system was one in which the projected revenue of a conquered territory was distributed in the form of temporary land grants among the Sipahis (cavalrymen) and other members of the military class including Janissaries and other kuls (slaves) of the Sultan. These land grants were given as compensation for annual military service, for which they received no pay. Timars could be small, granted by governors, or large which required a certificate from the Sultan but generally the fief had an annual value of less than twenty thousand akçes. Although the military officers were granted land they did not have title which was retained by the Sultan. If the military member died or left the land it reverted to the Sultan to be distributed to a new person. Under this system the temporary owners could demand about three days labour per year from the peasants living on their land.Bideleux-Jeffries 1998, p. 88. This is compared to two or three days a week under the Christian feudal system. This system of land tenure lasted roughly from the fourteenth century through to the sixteenth century. As late as 1528 as much as 87% of the land was officially the Sultan's land, the rest belonging to religious organizations. The goals of the system were necessitated by financial, state and expansionist purposes. The financial aims of the system were to relieve pressure from the Ottoman state of paying the army as well as to gain a new source of revenue for the central treasury. However, the system only worked while new land was being won by advancing Ottoman armies. When the Ottoman advance was halted in Europe and the Empire began to contract the Timar system began to collapse.Lampe-Jackson 1982, p. 33. Adoption With no new land to be divided up, the more powerful military commanders began to turn on the Ottoman Empire and its head of state the Sultan. Instead of focusing on conquering outside forces these military officials started to carve up the Empire into private land holdings that the then weakened Ottoman Empire was forced to recognize their claims. These new land holdings could be passed on to their sons. Most of the chiflik rulers only controlled small land holdings but some like Ali Pasha of Ioannina ruled autonomous kingdoms inside the Empire. Result Previously, peasants under the Timar system enjoyed a relatively liberal system. Under the Chiflik system they were ruled as serfs. No longer free to work for their own monetary gain they now had to labour under the rule of a feudal lord many days a week plus a larger percent of their harvest was seized. This increased oppression often led to peasants migrating to areas away from Chiflik control, or in the case of Greek peasants to the mountains where Ottoman authority didn't exist. The new oppressive system also increased peasant support for nationalist uprising against Ottoman rule in such places as the Balkans and Greece. The Chiflik system began to wane in the 1910s as Balkan territories gained independence. In Macedonia, peasants seized control of Chiflik lands and began exporting tobacco through Greece. After the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire the transition from the Chiflik to others agricultural systems led to events like the Kileler incident. The town of Al-Jiftlik The name of the Palestinian town Al-Jiftlik on the West Bank is derived from the above system of land tenure, which was applied there as in many other Ottoman locations.

A verse in metre is in four metrical lines called pādas. Unlike the majority of meters employed in classical Sanskrit, the meter is based on the number of s (morae) per .

It is believed that meter was taken from the gatha meter of Prakrit. p. 653 metre is common in Jain Prakrit texts and hence considered as favourite metre of early authors of Jainism.

That ended with William Quantrill's devastating guerrilla raid August 21, 1863. By early 1864 Union soldiers were permanently camped on the top and slopes of Mount Oread, then to Lawrence's southwest. It seems the camp was originally named Camp Ewing, after Brig. Gen.

Costa Rica offers some of the best health care in Latin America. Both the private and public health care systems are always being upgraded. New hospitals, new clinics, new machines, and improvement in staff and training. Statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO) frequently place Costa Rica in the top country rankings in the world for long life expectancy. WHO's 2000 survey ranked Costa Rica as having the 36th best health care system, placing it one spot above the United States at the time. In addition, the UN (United Nations) has ranked Costa Rica’s public health system within the top 20 worldwide and the number 1 in Latin America. Costs In the early 1970s, the Ministry of Heath was heavily subsidized by foreign aid. However, by 1977, health programs had been so successful that US Aid for International Development in the sector was ended, as the country was found \\"too healthy\\" to continue being a recipient. In 2001, total spending on health care was 7% of GDP, with 3/4 of that being the public sector. Currently, costs tend to be much less than doctor, hospital, and prescription costs in the U.S. The country spends one tenth as much per capita on health care as the United States, focusing on preventive care.Buettner, Dan. \\"The World's Happiest Places.\\" National Geographic, Nov. 2017, p. 45. Public Costa Rican Social Security Fund Logo The Costa Rican Social Security Fund or Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social (as it is known in Spanish) is in charge of most of the nation's public health sector. Its role in public health (as the administrator of health institutions) is key in Costa Rica, playing an important part in the state's national health policy making. Worker and employer contribution are mandated by law, under the principle of solidarity. Workers need to be cover by a \\"poliza de riesgo del trabajo\\" an insurance policy that complements the health care provided by the \\"Caja\\" for injuries related to labor risks. Caja services are guaranteed to all residents, including the uninsured.Cercone, James, Etoile Pinder, Jose Pacheco Jimenez, and Rodrigo Bricena. \\"Impact of Health Insurance on Access, Use, and Health Status in Costa Rica.\\" The Impact of Health Insurance in Low-and Middle-Income Countries, edited by Maria-Luisa Escobar, Charles C. Griffin, and R. Paul Shaw, Brookings Institution Press, Washington, D.C., 2010, pp. 89-105. In 1989 this was expanded to include undocumented immigrants as well, which constituted up to 8% of the population at the time. The percent of residents with health insurance increased gradually, as the program was originally only intended for urban workers. It was not until 1961 that universal mandatory coverage became a stated goal. After reaching a peak of 92% coverage in 1990, rates have remained around 88%. 12% of the insured are low-income residents who are eligible to have their coverage paid entirely by the state, based on a means-test. 87% of the uninsured enter a hospital via the emergency room, compared to only 58% of the insured. Emergency care is provided free of charge to all residents. This governmental entity's functions encompass both the administrative and functional aspects. It has the obligation (as a public institution) to formulate and execute health programs that are both preventive (such as: vaccination, informational, fumigation, etc.) and healing (such as: surgery, radiation therapy, pharmacy, clinical, etc.) in nature. Services \\"are aimed disproportionately\\" toward underprivileged Nicaraguan and Colombian immigrants and indigenous communities. Spending is relatively progressive, with the poorest quintile receiving 29% of spending while the richest quintile only receives 11%. In 2000, 90% of the country's doctors were employed by the public sector, but 1/3 of those also maintained a private practice. During the decade of the 1990s the percentage of all medical staff (not just doctors) who worked in the private sector increased from 10% to almost 25%. As more doctors opt for the more profitable field of private practice, especially in relation to medical tourism, the government has resorted to hiring around 100 Cuban doctors annually to work in the public sector, as of 2010. Alongside universal health care the government also provides basic dental care. However, this does not include most orthodontic procedures, such as braces. = EBAIS = The Equipos Báscios de Atención Integral en Salud (EBAIS), or Comprehensive Basic Health Care Team, began operating in 1995, under control of the Social Security Fund. The program had been proposed two years earlier by a bipartisan committee of experts set up by the president to redress decreases in the quality of services that had occurred over the preceding decade. The goal of the program is to ensure that all citizens have access to medical care, including rural residents. EBAIS employees are divided into teams of about five members, including one doctor. Team members visit people at their homes to vaccinate, offer medical advice, check vitals, and dispense medication. They also rectify any standing water situations they observe, which otherwise act as breeding grounds for mosquitoes and their associated diseases. EBAIS designates certain residences as high-risk due to subs-standard housing and amenities or risky health conditions (eg. teenage pregnancy). Members also address the health of patients' pets, such as ensuring that they are up to date on all necessary vaccinations. There are nearly 1,000 teams, each overseeing the health of 3,500-4,000 individuals. After an original rejection, $9 million was later granted for the creation of EBAIS by the World Bank. The rest of the $50 million price tag was paid for by the Social Security Fund. The Costa Rican Social Security Fund is also charged with the administration of the public pension system.  Reformed Healthcare Litigation  The development of the current public and private healthcare system in Costa Rica and its movement towards a progressive system came about as a response to a growing constitutional health rights in Costa Rica. The Costa Rican Supreme Court, the Sala IV, released litigations for medications, treatments, and other health care issues. Criticism from inside the health system regarding “the court’s jurisprudence elevated the right to health above financial considerations, and as a result posed a threat to the financial well-being of the state-run health care system.\\" A 2014 study researched successful health rights litigation and showed that less than 70% of favorable rulings were for low-priority medications in Costa Rica, revealing an unfair access to medications. To address these criticisms, the Sala IV partnered with the Cochrane Collaboration to integrate medical professional evaluations in its decision-making process for claims seeking access to medication. Then a new study was conducted researching the court’s reformed ruling process and whether it has changed in favor of the health rights conversation. It revealed that the probability of winning a medication lawsuit has increased drastically over time and that the percent of rulings granting experimental medications has declined while the percent granting high-priority medications increased. Based on the results, in comparison to the court’s pre-reform process, the reformed new process has led to some minor gains in fairness. Private Costa Rica is a popular destination for medical tourism because of the beautiful surroundings, low costs, abundance of bilingual medical personnel, and medical reputation. Over 40,000 Americans come to the country annually as medical tourists. Private insurance plans are available through the government-owned insurance company(INS). Private plans include dental work, optometry, well-visits and annual check-ups. 80% of the costs are covered for prescription drugs, certain medical exams, sick visits and hospitalization. Surgeon and aesthetician costs are covered at full cost. Currently, private medical insurance costs about $60–$250/month per person, depending on gender, age, other factors. Reasons for opting for private health care include shorter wait times and the ability to choose one's doctor. Around 30% of the population utilizes private health services at least once a year, according to surveys. Costa Rica has three internationally accredited private hospitals. The four largest private hospitals in Costa Rica are CIMA in the suburbs of San Jose, Clínica Biblica in the center of San Jose, Clínica Católica and Hospital Clinica UNIBE in the suburbs of San Jose. Domestic private health insurance was not legalized until 2006. International private insurance companies were not allowed to operate in the country until a Free Trade Agreement was signed with the United States in 2009. Pharmacy Many drugs (like birth control pills, high cholesterol medication, migraine medicine, etc.) are available in Costa Rica without a prescription. Many common problems can be accurately diagnosed and treated by pharmacists. Also, most major pharmacies have a doctor on staff. Most Costa Ricans head to the pharmacy first and consult with the pharmacist or doctor on staff; if he or she can not diagnose you or believe you need further treatment, you will be sent to the hospital.  Childbirth  Abortion in Costa Rica is restricted to situations that preserve the life or physical health of the mother. Abortions are illegal in cases of rape or incest, for social or economic reasons or when the unborn child suffers from medical problems or birth defects. Smoking It is illegal to smoke in all public vehicles, public buildings and recreation areas such as parks, stadia etc. References * ","title":"Healthcare in Costa Rica"},{"id":"25054955","text":"Hong Kong Institute of Languages (HKIL) is a privately owned language school established in 1985 by a French couple, Dominique and Christian Chasset.

crime drama directed by Leslie H. Martinson and produced by Warner Bros. Originally intended as television pilot, the film was instead released theatrically in the United Kingdom in 1962, and in the United States in 1963. FBI Code 98 stars many Warner Bros. contract players such as Jack Kelly, Ray Danton, Andrew Duggan and William Reynolds who later costarred on the Warner Bros Television show The F.B.I.. The film was narrated by William Woodson, who had previously narrated the radio show The FBI in Peace and War. Plot The president of an electronics company, Alan Nichols (Andrew Duggan), and his two vice presidents, Robert Cannon (Jack Kelly) and Fred Vitale (Ray Danton), are required at Cape Canaveral to oversee the test launching of a missile which their company developed. But before they are able to board the plane to take them there one of their suitcases is switched for one containing a bomb. Cannon opens his luggage when the men are in mid air and discovers the bomb, and his colleague Vitale manages to disarm it. The FBI is called in to determine whether this is a case of attempting to murder Cannon, whose suitcase contained the bomb, or an attempt to sabotage the air plane. The investigation soon proves that electronics project engineer Petersen made and planted the bomb in the suitcase. Petersen's motivation for doing this is that his son was fired by CEO Nichols, and when failing to blow up the plane he instead tries to blow up Nichols yacht, with the wife and her lover on it. The task for the FBI is to stop this endeavour.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/74682/FBI-Code-98/ Cast *Jack Kelly as Robert P. Cannon *Ray Danton as Fred Vitale *Andrew Duggan as Alan W.

These companion shadows of the first and second ribs occur in 35% and 31% of the population, respectively. Rib companion shadows represent the fat and muscles in the intercostal space. The shadows that accompany the ribs may mimic pleural and lung disease., Kurihara Y., Yakushiji Y.K., Matsumoto J., Ishikawa T., Hirata K., The Ribs: Anatomic and Radiologic Considerations, January 1999 RadioGraphics, 19, 105-119. * Scapular companion shadow overlie the scapula, with a smooth, well-defined margin parallel to the medial border of the scapula.

Background Significant Landscape Overlays are used as part of constructing Planning Schemes by each local government in Victoria, Australia. In combination with Zones which control land usage, Overlays are designed to control land development. Other Overlays include Heritage Overlays (HOs), Design and Development Overlays (DDOs), Neighbourhood Character Overlays (NCOs), Land Subject to Inundation Overlays (LSIOs), Special Building Overlays (SBOs), Public Acquisition Overlays (PAOs), Environmental Audit Overlays (EAOs) and Vegetation Protection Overlays (VPOs). Every Planning Scheme provides maps that locate areas affected by each type of Overlay. Conservation The Significant Landscape Overlay is used to both determine landscapes of significance at the municipal level as well as to conserve and control the kind of development that occurs within those landscapes. Landscapes may be deemed significant for a combination of historic, aesthetic, scientific, religious and social reasons - where vegetation is deemed integral to the amenity of the area. Schedules to Overlays set out specific requirements to be met in particular locations within a municipality. Each Schedule to a Significant Landscape Overlay contains: * a Statement of nature and key elements of landscape * Landscape character objective to be achieved * Permit requirements * Decision guidelines * Reference documents Within areas covered by the Significant Landscape Overlay, planning permits are required to: * remove or trim a protected tree * undertake building works within four metres of protected trees * erect new buildings or extend existing buildings * construct a fence A protected tree is identified as any that has a circumference of fifty centimetres or greater at one metre above ground-level. Each Overlay provides a Table of Exemptions for the removal or trimming of protected trees to the minimum necessary extent possible. Significant Landscape Overlays also set limits as to the percentage of land which may be built upon, minimum set-backs from the property boundaries and maximum building heights. Residents can apply to their local government to have Zones and Overlays on their land changed. Changes are not usually made to individual properties but to areas of land. Changes may also be made as a result of changes to Local Planning Policy.

The game allowed members of Facebook to manage virtual aquariums by rearing fish. As of October 2011, FishVille had 1.6 million monthly active users. The game was discontinued on December 5, 2012. Gameplay When users begin the game, they can start by choosing a background and gravel for their aquariums. The users start with four fish already present in their tank. A tutorial then commences which takes the user through some of the basic functions of the game which include adding fish to the aquarium, feeding and selling fish. Upon selling fish, the user earns \\"sand coins\\" and experience points (XP). The player also earns XP and coins for completing certain tasks and helping in neighbor missions. At certain XP benchmarks, the player's level rises. As the player obtains more items and progresses through levels, fish, decorations, environments, creatures and plants become available to them via the \\"store\\" where items can be purchased using either sand coins or \\"sand dollars\\". Sand dollars are earned by leveling up, completing offers or microtransactions. Fish Fish rearing is the main activity in FishVille. Players can buy fish from the store using sand dollars or sand coins. Fish can also be added into the aquarium by receiving gifts sent by neighbors and Facebook friends. Fish require to be fed as they age. Each fish has three stages of growth – Baby, Junior and Adult. Once the fish become junior or adult fish they can be sold for coins and XP. The XP and coins earned by selling the fish depends on the type of fish. If the fish are not fed, they become sick and then eventually die. Players can purchase up to eight additional tanks if their tanks run out of space. Recently, Zynga launched a new feature in FishVille called \\"Arena Tanks\\". In an Arena tank a user can place fish which are classified as arena or super arena. These fish can then be trained using \\"super foods\\" which help improve certain traits of the fish which include IQ, Strength, Agility and Health. The fish then can \\"combat\\" with other arena fish which helps the player gain XP, coins and other rewards. Decorations and other items In addition to fish, players can also place decorations, plants and creatures to deck out their tanks. These additional items can be purchased from the store with the in-game currency or can be acquired through the game's gifting mechanism. The FishVille store has a vast array of decorations and creatures which get unlocked and are available for purchase as the user levels up in the game. The store also allows the user to change the environment (wallpaper) and gravel of the tank. The FishVille store is constantly updated with new items and content. Items are also added for seasons and for special themes. Special themes when added, provide players with the opportunity to decorate the tank with items related to a particular season or theme. Social interaction Like most Zynga games, FishVille incorporates the social networking aspect of Facebook into many areas of gameplay. Players may invite their friends to be their neighbors, allowing them to perform certain actions on each other's tanks per day by \\"visiting\\" it. Neighbors may also send gifts and other supplies like medicine to each other and complete specialized tasks together for rewards. Through the FishVille Forums and FishVille fan page, weekly contests like \\"Tank of the Week\\" are held where users can provide screenshots of their tanks and can compete for prizes. Prizes often range from \\"Sand Dollars\\" to \\"exclusive fish\\". Reception Jim Squires, from GameZebo, said that the game was \\"easily one of Facebook's greatest underwater adventures\\" and that \\"FishVille offers up a perfect blend of familiarity and freshness that any fish lover can enjoy\\". Ryan Geddes, from IGN, stated that the game is an incredibly efficient advertising and microtransaction delivery tool\\". Discontinuation Sometime in November 2012, it was announced that FishVille would be discontinued on December 5, 2012 along with several other Zynga games.

It is situated in the Udalguri district of Assam state. The average altitude is 37 meters. The climate is humid and congenial, while the relative humidity is around 82%. The annual rainfall is around 2,000 mm. Etymology The origin of name of this ancient place can be found in a local legend about a brahmin priest, named Kendukalai who was appointed the chief priest of the Kamakhya Temple. According to the legend, he was supposedly able to cause the goddess Kamakhya Devi appear in her mortal form in the temple and dance, because of his musical talents and devotion to her. The erstwhile Koch king Naranarayan, coming to know of this, wished to see the goddess. He asked the king to hide near the temple and watch through a hole and began his worship. The goddess appeared and started dancing in the temple, but eventually saw the eyes of the King through the hole, and came to know of his treachery. Some versions of the legends say that the goddess cursed the dynasty of the king and the priest would be destroyed if they ever visited the temple, while others say the angered goddess turned the king into a stone statue and decapitated the priest. The head of the deceased priest got thrown away by the force of the mortal blow and landed in a place 13 km north, which was later named as Muradeor, which was his birthplace. The name of Kendukalai later degraded to Kalaigaon. Even today, Kendukalai village exists 8 km west, towards Tangla, from present day Kalaigaon, on M.B. Road. Demographics According to 2011 census records, the total population of Kalaigaon sub- division was 110862, of which, 56285 (50.77%) were males and 54577 (49.22%) were females. Some villages of Kalaigaon fall in Darrang district, and the population there was 24246 (12723 males and 12523 females). The remaining majority of villages are in Udalguri district, and the population there was 85616 (43562 males and 42054 females). Economy The economy of this place is heavily dependent on agriculture. Cultivation of rice is the primary agricultural activity, vegetables being a close second.Roofed shelters of Sunday Market of Kalaigaon However, over the last few years, consumerism has contributed to the steep rise in the consumer goods business. Due to heavy rice cultivation, many small indigenous rice mills came up in and around the town which supply rice to other parts of Assam; Guwahati being the largest consumer of its rice. The Kalaigaon rice brand has now set up its own identity in Assam. There are also a number of co-operative societies as well as banking institutes. This place also has two weekly market days, one on Sundays and another on Thursdays. A unique feature being that livestock trading takes place on Thursdays almost exclusively, which is very rare in these parts of the world. This market is locally known as Goru Bojar, cattle market. These markets attracts a large number of people around the district every Thursday and Sunday, often making transportation very cumbersome in the town. There are also a few tea gardens in and around this town. Before 1950, most of them were owned by British tea companies. Terrorism and Insurgency Like other parts of Assam, there has been incidents of terrorism in Kalaigaon. There have been instances when security agencies and terrorists have come into direct conflict within this region. However, in the recent years, the frequency of such incidents have greatly declined.

The Bissett family were forfeited of their lands in Scotland and fled for their lives to Ireland after Walter de Bisset was accused of the murder of Patrick, Earl of Atholl, at Haddington, East Lothian in 1242. King Henry III of England granted Bisset large possessions in the Barony of Glenarm, Ireland. John Mor MacDonald 1st of Dunnyveg married Margery Bissett of the Glens of Antrim, and acquired as a result the castle of Red Bay. His descendants known as the MacDonnells of Antrim extended and rebuilt the castle in the 16th century. In 1565, the castle was burned to the ground by Shane O'Neill, chief of the O'Neills of Tyrone; it was rebuilt by Sorley Boy MacDonnell, however later fell into disrepair.

During her 16-year international career, Davis represented the England women's national football team in the inaugural 1984 UEFA Championships final and at England's first FIFA Women's World Cup appearance in 1995. She also helped England win the Mundialito tournament in Italy and scored for her country at Wembley Stadium. At club level Davis spent four seasons playing in Italy, in between spells with Crewe Alexandra Ladies. She later played for Liverpool Ladies and Croydon. Club career Davis was a 23–year–old student from Stoke-on-Trent, playing for Crewe Alexandra Ladies, when Italian club Roi Lazio signed her in November 1985. She spent four years playing semi–professionally in Italy, one year at the Stadio Flaminio with Roi Lazio, two years with Trani and one with Napoli. In her second season with Trani, Davis played alongside compatriot Debbie Bampton. They finished runners–up in both the Serie A and national Cup before the club folded and Bampton returned to England. After a further year at Napoli, Davis returned to Crewe Alexandra Ladies, but by April 1994 was playing for Knowsley United Women in the FA Women's Cup final. Knowsley became Liverpool Ladies that summer and Davis left for Croydon Women in December 1994. In 1996, Davis was playing for Croydon when they won the league and cup double. In May 1996 goals from Davis and Brenda Sempare earned the decisive 2–1 league win over Arsenal Ladies. That summer she sparked rumours of a transfer by guesting for Arsenal Ladies in a pre–season tournament, but remained with Croydon. She eventually resigned in April 1999. International career Davis played in the first UEFA championships for national women's teams in 1984. England reached the final only to lose to Sweden on penalties, despite Davis successfully converting her kick. In the qualifying stages, Davis had been England's top scorer after making her debut in the first ever match in UEFA competition; a 7–1 win over Northern Ireland at Gresty Road on 19 September 1982. In August 1985 Davis scored in a 1–1 group stage draw with Italy, during England's victorious Mundialito campaign. At the 1987 UEFA championships England lost to Sweden at the semi–final stage, 3–2 after extra time. Davis gave England the lead against Italy in the third place match, but Carolina Morace and Betty Vignotto replied to ensure England finished fourth. As a curtain–raiser to the 1990 FA Charity Shield, England played Italy at Wembley Stadium. Davis netted a consolation in England's 4–1 defeat, while Carolina Morace scored all four Italian goals and featured on the front page of the following day's La Gazzetta dello Sport. Davis later described her former Trani teammate Morace as: \\"the best women's player I have ever seen.\\" Davis also played in all four of England's matches at the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup. She had won her 60th cap in the 4–1 UEFA Women's Euro 1995 semi–final first–leg defeat to Germany on 11 December 1994. In May 1996 Davis scored two goals and set up the other for strike–partner Kelly Smith in a 3–0 win over Portugal at Griffin Park. Although Davis's versatility saw her selected as a midfielder or sometimes as a defender, she continued to score at a prolific rate. By the time of a World Cup qualifier against the Netherlands in October 1997, Davis had 42 goals in 78 appearances. In March 1998, Davis made her 82nd and final appearance for England, but was substituted 20 minutes into a 1–0 defeat to Germany at The Den. Davis left the England squad in April 1998, ahead of another friendly with Italy. In October 2010, She Kicks magazine reported that Davis remained England's all–time record goalscorer. Although it was stated that records were \\"sketchy\\" because the Football Association (FA) took over running women's football in 1993. There was uncertainty whether all Davis's goals before this were scored in matches considered official. In February 2012 Kelly Smith netted twice against Finland, moving on to 45 goals for England and setting a new record.

History  In 1839, Joseph Gilbert arrived in Australia after he had decided to leave his home in the Vale of Pewsey in Wiltshire.Wine Doctor: Pewsey Vale, thewinedoctor.com, accessed 11 November 2009. Prior to his arrival, Gilbert had read in The Times that the ship, The Buckinghamshire, would be leaving for Australia. He had made the decision to leave his home after this news and wasted no time purchasing land after he arrived in Australia, buying 15,000 acres in the Barossa Valley. In 1841, two years after his purchase of the land in Barossa Valley, he bought more land in the Eden Valley. This particular area was at an altitude of approximately 500 meters above sea level. At this altitude, the cooler temperatures were crucial to the eventual success of the winery, as cold would allow for the grapes to undergo longer periods of ripening.Pewsey Vale: Vineyard , pewseyvale.com, accessed 11 November 2009. At the age of 38, Gilbert had built a home on the Eden Valley property and began to plant his first grapevines, but they were of the table grape variety. It was not until 1847 when Gilbert started to plant grapes for the purpose of winemaking, hence establishing Eden Valley’s first winery. During the initial stages of his efforts, Gilbert was known to tinker with his approach to winemaking. His findings during this time were crucial to the wine industry in the Eden Valley. Gilbert was also known to take some of his cuttings and distribute them to others in the region who were interested in starting their own vineyard. Despite the fact that the vineyard was established over 160 years ago, it has not been in operation for that entire duration. Economic issues during the Great Depression in the 1920s caused the Pewsey Vale winery to go downhill, which eventually led to a long period of abandonment.Wine Business Monthly, winebusiness.com, 15 February 2001, accessed 11 November 2009. It was not until 1961, when Geoffrey Angas Parsons, the owner of Pewsey Vale at the time, found out that his property was home to the region's first vineyard. Parsons and his friend, Wyndham Hill Smith, discussed the idea of restoring the property. At the time, several wineries were looking at potential sites with cooler ripening conditions than those found in the Barossa Valley. Intrigued, Parsons and Hill Smith began to restore the vineyard and planted 56 hectares of riesling and cabernet sauvignon.WinePros: Pewsey Vale , winepros.com.au, accessed 11 November 2009. It was at this time that the modern Pewsey Vale winery was founded.  Riesling and the Stelvin Cap The Pewsey Vale Riesling became recognized in 1969 after winning a number of awards,Pewsey Vale and Stelvin; The Contours , pewseyvale.com, 29 January 2009, accessed 11 November 2009. and to this day, the Contour Riesling is thought to be the signature wine produced by the winery. Starting in 1977, Pewsey Vale became the first winery to use the Stelvin screw cap to seal their bottles of wine. After 20 years under cork, Pewsey Vale Riesling will revert to screw-cap in 2003 , pewseyvale.com, 14 July 2003, accessed 11 November 2009. The Stelvin proved to be a much better method of sealing the wine than the previously used Stelcap The new closure eliminated the possibility of wine taint from cork. In addition, the seal would not allow any air into the bottle, thus ensuring the wine would undergo a slower aging process. Rieslings of Pewsey Vale with Louisa Rose , winepages.com, September 2000, accessed 11 November 2009. Despite the fact that the Australian wine industry was interested in the idea of sealing wines with the Stelvin screw-cap, consumers did not agree. Because consumers saw the use of a metallic cap as an indication of an inferior product, the winery stopped using the Stelvin screw-cap in 1984.The birth of Prima, theaustralian.com.au, 22 March 2008, accessed 11 November 2009. Pewsey Vale never fully gave up on the idea, and reintroduced the Stelvin in 1995 for their riesling wines intended for museum use. In 2000, current winemaker Louisa Rosa was quoted as saying: Pewsey Vale Rieslings are renowned for their exceptional aging ability. While Australian wine consumers may not be quite ready to go back to Pewsey Vale in Stelvin, at least we can rest assured that the aging potential of these (museum) wines will be maximised. From 2003, it was decided that all Pewsey Vale Rieslings would be released with the Stelvin screw-cap.

Biography At the Moscow State University he studied theoretical linguistics (1971) and structural linguistics (1973). He defended his Ph.D. in 1981 (Sostav i xarakteristika balkanoslavjanskix jazykov), on the comparative analysis of Slavic languages in the Balkans. Until 1990 he worked at the Institute of Slavic and Balkan Studies in Moscow, where he completed his second doctoral thesis in 1989 (Sravniteľno-istoričeskaja grammatika albanskogo jazyka: fonetika i morfologija), on the historical grammar of Albanian. In the period 1989–1990 he also taught historical linguistics at Moscow State University. After his emigration to Israel he continued to teach at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (1991–92). Later he relocated to the Tel-Aviv University, where he taught in the Department of Classical Studies in the period of 1992–97, on comparative linguistics, mythology and folklore, history and philosophy. In 1994 he worked at the Shalom Hartman Institute in Jerusalem when he was dedicated to the biblical studies, and the following two years acting as a visiting scholar at Wolfson College, Oxford. The last two years in Israel (1997–99) he spent at Bar-Ilan University. Afterward he went to Calgary in Canada, where he started to work at Zi Corporation as a director of research and language teaching (2001–02). After a brief activity at the Princeton University in New Jersey (2001–02), where he worked in the department of testing services, he started to work at the universities in Alberta, Canada, specifically Athabasca University (since 2003), Mount Royal College (since 2003), University of Calgary (since 2004), University of Lethbridge (2004–05). There he lectured on comparative linguistics, Biblical Studies, as well as on also business English, English literature, creative writing, etc. Since 2005, he ran the Translation Center at the Calgary Regional Health Authority. Work Even though he worked only three decades as a professional research linguist, Orel's work encompassed extraordinary variety of interests: from Slavic via modern Balkan languages to Paleo-Balkan languages (most notably Phrygian), from Proto-Indo-European roots and its Nostratic context on the one hand, to the analysis of Biblical Hebrew and Old Testament texts and Proto-Afroasiatic language on the other hand. He has left behind about 200 articles and over two dozen reviews. Above all, however, are 6 monographs, four of which are etymological dictionaries (with the unassuming titles such as Handbook of Germanic etymology actually hiding a full etymological dictionary). Finally, the 3rd part of his Russian etymological dictionary (which was already termed as \\"new Vasmer\\") was unfinished due to his premature death. His Albanian Etymological Dictionary (1998) is a particularly useful overview of existing etymologies, and it well complements his A Concise Historical Grammar of Albanian (2000). The monograph Phrygian Language (1997) summarizes the old/neo-Phrygian epigraphy, interpretation of all the known inscriptions until the 1990s and the corresponding grammatical comments. Orel also dealt with the Indo-European languages, especially the Balto-Slavic, Germanic, Albanian, and Celtic branches. He also took interest in Semitic languages, Hebrew in the first place, and more broadly in Afroasiatic languages as a whole, where lie his most controversial results. Through collaboration with Olga Stolbova he published Hamito-Semitic Etymological Dictionary (1995) which on one hand brought a number of interesting and new sub-lexical comparison, especially Semitic-Chadic. On the other hand, the value of the benefits of reduced transcriptions used and inaccurate translations, absence of primary sources for non-written languages, and especially countless pseudo-reconstructions formulated ad hoc often on two or even a single word were seriously frowned upon by specialists, who also pointed out other serious errors in the work (especially in Cushitic material, as well as not neglecting the massive amount of Arabic loanwords in Berber languages).

It runs on operating systems including Linux and others that are Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) compliant. Its most prominent features are simplicity and minimalism. It is built on one internal data type: a cell. On the language level, a programmer can use three different data types (numbers, symbols, and lists) being represented by cells and differentiated by bits at the end of the cell. It is free and open-source software released under an MIT License (X11).  Features  Functions can accept arbitrary types and numbers of arguments. Macros are needed only in rare cases and are implemented using the quote function. PicoLisp does not include Lisp's lambda function. This is because the quote function is changed to return all its arguments unevaluated, not only the \`car\` of the first. A special feature is the intrinsic create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) functioning. Persistent symbols are first-class citizens (objects), they are loaded from database files automatically when accessed, and written back when modified. Applications are written using a class hierarchy of entities and relations. Other features include: Prolog engine, database engine and database queries, distributed databases, inlining of C language functions and native C function calls, child process management, interprocess communication, browser graphical user interface (GUI), and internationalization and localization.  History  In the 1980s, PicoLisp began development on the Macintosh, and was used in commercial application development since then. It was ported to DOS and SCO Unix. Since 1993, it was used mainly on Linux. In the mid-1990s, database functions were added. The first versions were written in a mix of C and assembly language. In 1999, a first rewrite from scratch was done, fully in C. In 2002, that version was released under a GNU General Public License (GNU GPL). In 2010, it changed to an MIT/X11 license. In 2009, the 64-bit version was released, another rewrite, this time written in generic assembly, which in turn is implemented in PicoLisp. This version adds support for coroutines. In December 2010, a Java version named Ersatz PicoLisp was released. In September 2014, Burger announced the PilMCU project on the PicoLisp development listserv, an effort with George Orais to implement PicoLisp in hardware directly. In the summer of 2016, development of PilBox (\\"PicoLisp Box\\") – a generic Android app allowing to write apps in pure PicoLisp – was started. It is still being developed and maintained.

Only one was built. Development The Aero Club of the Royal Aircraft Establishment built two light aircraft in 1923, the Zephyr and the Hurricane, then no more until 1931.In 1926 they designed and started to build the RAE Sirocco for the Lympne trials, but it was never completed. See Jackson (1960) p.517 This, their final effort was the RAE Scarab or PB Scarab as it is sometimes known,Flight 19 February 1932 p.149 after its designers P G N Peters and C R Brewer. Even so, it was not all their own work for the wing and empennage were from a low-winged DH.53, itself a 1923 aircraft. What they did was to reposition the wing on a new fuselage to make a new, parasol winged monoplane, a change that required the creation of a centre section and the struts to support it. With its new fuselage,In the 1st edition (1960) of British Civil Aircraft, Jackson says that the DH.52 fuselage was retained, but the 1974 edition makes it clear it was new, in agreement with Ord-Hume the Scarab was longer than the DH.53, at 21 ft 0 in (6.40 m) compared with 19 ft 8 in (5.99 m). Most of the extra length was in the nose, for the DH.53 was a very snub-nosed machine compared with the Scarab. Both aircraft had flat sided fuselages built up from four longerons in the usual manner of the time, with rounded decking. The DH.53 pilot had sat over mid-chord, but the combination of 5o of sweepback and the change of centre of gravity due to the longer nose in the Scarab meant he could sit at the trailing edge of the new, narrow chord centre section. Given the small gap between the top of the fuselage and the underside of the parasol wing, a mid chord cockpit would have been inaccessible and have restricted the pilot's view severely. A pair of lift stuts extended in a V from the lower fuselage longerons on each side to the two wing spars at the point where these were thickened for the compression struts of the DH.53. As on the DH.53, the wings had constant chord with slightly rounded tips, carrying long differential ailerons. In contrast to those of the DH.53, the wings of the Scarab folded for transport. The Scarab's undercarriage was also new, a split axle unit with the main legs going to the upper longerons and bracing to the lower ones. The undercarriage track was 5 ft (1.52 m). Like some DH.53s, the Scarab was powered by a 32 hp (24 kW) Bristol Cherub III flat twin. The sole Scarab was registeredRegistration of G-ABOH as G-ABOH . Its first flight was in February 1932 with H.H. Leech at the controls. Though underpowered and slow, it seems to have flown nicely and had a surprising rate of climb. It flew from Farnborough until 1938, when it was stored and then scrapped in 1945.

Opened in 1901, it was a leading military boarding school in the Pacific Northwest. Originally located in Northwest Portland, it later moved to Rocky Butte where it remained until it closed in 1959. The school was a party to the Pierce v. Society of Sisters United States Supreme Court case. Founder The academy's founder, Joseph Wood Hill, was born in Westport, Connecticut, on May 28, 1856, and was raised in Connecticut.Gaston, Joseph. 1911. Portland, Oregon, its History and Builders: in Connection with the Antecedent Explorations, Discoveries, and Movements of the Pioneers that Selected the Site for the Great City of the Pacific. Chicago: S.J. Clarke Pub. Co. Vol. III. pp. 451-454. He attended the Selleck school in Norwalk before enrolling at Yale University in 1874, where he earned a bachelor of arts degree in 1878. Hill then moved west to Oregon where he was hired as the headmaster of the Bishop Scott grammar school in Portland in 1879. In 1881, while still serving as headmaster, Hill graduated from the Willamette University College of Medicine with a Doctor of Medicine. The grammar school became Bishop Scott Academy in 1887, with Hill becoming principal that year of the expanded school, serving until 1901. History In 1901, Hill left Bishop Scott Academy and founded the Hill Military Academy on Marshall Street in Portland. John W. Gavin served as the vice principal and headmaster at this time. The school was incorporated in 1908, and Hill’s oldest son Joseph A. became the vice president of the school that year. The son took over as manager in 1910, with Major G. C. Von Egloffstein taking over as headmaster. Joseph Wood Hill remained as principal until at least 1911. In 1922, Oregon voters passed the Compulsory Education Act, an initiative supported by the Ku Klux Klan as an anti-Catholic measure that required attendance in public schools. Hill Academy and a society that ran several Catholic schools both sued the state to prevent the enactment of the law on Fourteenth Amendment grounds, and won in federal district court. On appeal to the United States Supreme Court, that court upheld the injunction against the law in Pierce v. Society of Sisters.Pierce v. Society of Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, 268 U.S. 510 (1925). In 1931, the school moved to a new campus on Rocky Butte in eastern Portland.Corning, Howard M. (1989) Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing. p. 114. It operated at its Rocky Butte location for 18 years until, with its enrollment in decline, the school closed in 1959. In the years since the site has been home to several schools, and the 2.38 acre \\"Joseph Wood Hill Park\\" was established by City of Portland sometime after 1988. Campus and academics Hill Military Academy cadet Lee Strickland in 1921 Hill Military Academy’s original campus was located in a residential area in northwest Portland. The campus consisted of two buildings, the main building and an armory. The two-story armory measured 50 by 100 feet and included a drill hall and workshops. Hill’s main building was a four-story structure with battlements on the exterior wall, and in general designed in the Scots Baronial Style. This building housed the boarding students of the academy. Students at Hill wore uniforms and attended college preparatory classes as well as classes in the military department. The school had both boarding students and day class enrollees. Summer courses were held at camps held on the Oregon Coast or in the mountains. The school was considered a pioneer in military education in the Pacific Northwest.

Education From 1976 to 1981 Zaniewski studied at the Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts. Until the mid-1980s he was active solely as a painter but later began creative work in commercials and photography. Painting As a painter, Zaniewski works mostly in oils and drawing media. His themes usually centre on scenes from everyday life while his earlier works are still lives, nudes and the occasional landscape. Despite changes in convention as to the portrayal of reality over subsequent periods the characteristic feature of Zaniewski's paintings has remained essentially that of composition. His use of composition rests upon an arrangement of forms wherein every potential alteration would give rise to a breakdown of cohesive construction and a deterioration of harmony. As such, his paintings are not readily ascribed to any one particular requisite trend in the history of contemporary art. The key to Zaniewski's work is not its context or its being a public medium, rather a visual sensitivity in seeing comprehensively. Advertising career Zaniewski's first commercial projects were for the Spanish advertising agency Bassat, Ogilvy & Mather in Barcelona. Thereafter, his first Polish commercials were for ITI Agency. From 1992 to 1999 he was artistic director of the Grey Agency in Warsaw. He created advertising campaigns for brands such as Knorr, Frugo, Okocim, Radio Zet, Lucky Strike, and Malma. In 1999, along with Kot Przybora he founded the Przybora Zaniewski Ltd advertising agency (PLZ) where he is now both artistic director and a commercial director. PZL has created advertising campaigns for Frugo, Dębowe Mocne, Żubr, Redds, Orlen, Tetley, Olej Kujawski, Manuel, Simplus, and the longest-running Polish advertising campaign for brand name Plus.

The indie album was lauded by a Spin Magazine review,Articles are collected on Waller's website press summary page and other broadly read publications and in REVOLVER Magazine Ann Powers wrote, \\"For melodic sweep, the prize goes to Holcombe Waller, whose self-released Extravagant Gesture is a small pop epic.\\"REVOLVER Magazine, May/June Issue, 2001 Waller's pop influences shifted towards folk for his 2005 release, Troubled Times. The work continued to receive broad critical attention including a positive review in Paste Magazine and a large editorial feature in BUTT Magazine.Paste Magazine, Issue #17, August/September, 2005 Since Troubled Times, Waller has focused on commissions for multidisciplinary performance, dance scores, collaborations, and film scores. He has recently completed \\"Into the Dark Unknown,\\" an album of music from his touring theatrical folk concert by the same name. The album has posted for public release February 15, 2011.  Early life  Waller was born Michael Sagalowicz in Stanford, California. He lived in Palo Alto until the age of 18, when he moved to Los Angeles to record a solo album, never released, with a now-defunct upstart label. At 19, he moved to New Haven, Connecticut as an undergraduate student at Yale University. There he produced work for various artists and bands, and casually picked up guitar. He was a member of and musical director of The Duke's Men of Yale for three years, contributing numerous arrangements. Waller produced and mixed two albums for Project Nim, a band that included fellow Yalie Bryce Dessner as well as Aaron Dessner and Bryan Devendorf, all now members of The National. Waller also recorded and mixed fellow Yalie Mia Doi Todd's album Come Out of Your Mine in 1997 in Dwight Chapel on Yale Campus, where he held his first public performance with guitar and vocals in the Spring of 1998. That year Waller began recording for his first album, Advertising Space. The sessions included Bryce on guitar, Aaron on bass and Bryan on drums. Waller graduated from Yale with a degree in Art, specializing in video installation, and moved back to his home state of California, settling in San Francisco. Waller finished and self-released Advertising Space in 1999 on his imprint, Napoleon Records. Though only locally promoted, the album was picked up by Hear Music and editorially featured in all of their stores. From 2000 to 2004, Waller worked in the information technology department of an internet hosting company, which allowed him to fund his next two albums. Extravagant Gesture (2001 Napoleon Records) also featured Bryce Dessner on guitars, and was picked up by Redeye Distribution in the United States. Troubled Times (2005 Napoleon Records) represented an artistic shift towards a more spare, folk-oriented orchestration. It was recorded in collaboration with college friend and multi- instrumentalist Ben Landsverk and features a guest performance by Mia Doi Todd. By 2005, Waller had left his job and moved to Portland, Oregon with the intention of becoming a full-time musician and artist. His sister Leslie and his niece Emily are very important to him, he loves them dearly. Leslie raised Emily with her late husband Steve but moved to Portland to be closer to her brother.  Career  Upon arriving in Portland in 2005, Waller's trajectory shifted towards multidisciplinary performance. He was cast in One, an original musical by Wade McCollum, and Tao Soup, a multidisciplinary ensemble piece by Scott Kelman. In 2006, Waller began integrating his experiences in theater, video installation and music with a piece titled Mihael Sagalovesky and the Tragic Torments of Patty Heart Townes. The work featured 6 Patty Griffin songs and 6 Townes Van Zandt songs arranged to represent a broad narrative arch of dissolution and redemption. The work premiered in Portland in 2007 and toured to New York (Joe's Pub) and Philadelphia. In 2008, Waller was commissioned by the Portland Institute for Contemporary Art and On the Boards of Seattle to create his theatrical folk concert, Into the Dark Unknown: The Hope Chest. The work integrated aspects of theater, video installation and folk concert. The work was supported by the Rockefeller Foundation's prestigious MAP Fund and toured to the New York Public Theater (Under the Radar Festival), Seattle's On the Boards, PuSh International Performing Arts Festival (Vancouver BC), Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, and the Queer Zagreb Festival, among others. An album of music from the show features his ensemble, The Healers, as well as drummer Danny Seim (Menomena, Lackthereof). The album was funded by a Kickstarter campaign in the Spring of 2010, and is scheduled for release Winter 2011. In the Fall of 2009, Waller was a Visiting Artist Lecturer in the Department of Theater, Performance Studies and Dance at the University of California, Berkeley, where he taught the seminar Contemporary Song-based Performance Art. Winter 2010, Waller launched the development of a new multidisciplinary performance titled \\"Surfacing,\\" commissioned with the National Performance Network by OutNorth and Helena Presents.  Collaborations  Waller has created two collaborative performances with Joe Goode Performance Group: \\"Small Experiments in Song and Dance,\\" which premiered in January 2009 at the Brava Theater in San Francisco, and \\"Dead Boys,\\" a musical which premiered at the Zellerbach Playhouse at U.C. Berkeley in October 2009.

Member of German Parliament  Nord was the directly elected deputy of constituency 63 in 17th Legislature (2009 – 2013) of the German Parliament. He was a member of the Committee on the affairs of the European Union, and a substitute member of the Committee for Culture and Media and the Defence Committee. He was deputy chairman of the German-Polish and German-French Parliamentary Friendship Groups for DIE LINKE. In the 18th Legislature (2013–Present) he is a member of the Committee of Economy and Energy, substitute member of the Committee on the Affairs of the European Union and a member of the Subcommittee on Regional Economic Policy. He is chairman of the German-Polish Parliamentary Group and Deputy Chairman of the German-French Parliamentary Friendship Group. He is also a national spokesperson for the Group of Brandenburger Deputies of DIE LINKE.  Unofficial employee of GDR Ministry of State Security (MfS)  In March 1990 Thomas Nord revealed himself as an informer of the Ministry of State Security in connection with the local elections in Berlin. \\"I was by political conviction an unofficial member of the MfS.\\" Nord sees it today as a personal failure. \\"Since that time I pointed at each running for office or mandate on this part of my biography.\\" Nord’s past has been repeatedly examined critically by the media in the course of his political career.:de:Thomas Nord On 25 February 2010, after extra discussion after a parliamentary session:de:Thomas Nord CDU/CSU requested a review process referred to in point 3 of the \\"arrangement for carrying out the directives issued pursuant §44c ABGG\\". SPD and FDP joined the request, while the Greens cast doubt on the need for the process. The hearing on Thomas Nord occurred on 24 February 2011. On 30 June 2011, the Committee for the Scrutiny of Elections, Immunity and the Rules of Procedure (AfW) completed the review process. The review found a proven activity of the Member of Parliament for the MfS. The report includes: Nord was first contacted during his time at the People's Navy and in 1984 was enlisted by the Ministry of State Security. Official documents show that in 1977 the MfS became aware of Mr. Nord during his four-year military service in the People's Navy of the GDR from 1976 to 1980. According to a memorandum of a lieutenant in 1982, Nord was approached from September 1978 to October 1980. Out of political conviction he volunteered a declaration of commitment to the MfS, working under the pseudonym Marc Schindler.:de:Thomas Nord As a youth club leader in Berlin Prenzlauer Berg, he reported on young people and colleagues who were critical of the GDR. According to his IM-flow Record, by resolution of 28 February 1984 Mr. Nord was obliged to become a GMS (Employee of MfS) and remained so until the political changes in the GDR in 1989. The report of the AfW and Nord himself did not exclude that his actions injured others. In the investigation of the committee no concrete evidence was found that in his work for the MfS Thomas Nord had directly injured others.

He was drafted by the Oakland Raiders in the fourth round of the 2010 NFL Draft. He played college football at Maryland. He is the son of the late former Providence College basketball great Bruce \\"Soup\\" Campbell. He has also been a member of the Carolina Panthers, New York Jets, Toronto Argonauts, and Saskatchewan Roughriders. Early years Campbell originally attended Hyde Leadership School in New Haven, Connecticut, where he was a four-year letterman and never missed a game during his career. He played defensive end all four years and started at that spot and offensive tackle his last two years. Campbell had 50 tackles, including 4.5 quarterback sacks, while blocking two PATs and one punt as a junior, and recorded 70 tackles, including six sacks, two forced fumbles and one fumble recovery his senior season in 2005. He subsequently earned PrepStar All-American honors. Considered a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, Campbell was ranked as the No. 17 offensive tackle prospect in 2006. He chose Maryland over Michigan State, Nebraska, and Virginia. However, before enrolling at Maryland, Campbell spent a preparation year at Hargrave Military Academy. College career In his true freshman season at Maryland in 2007, Campbell appeared in five games at left tackle, including one start against Clemson when injuries hit the Terrapins' offensive line. Campbell played in all 13 games in 2008, and saw action as a reserve at left tackle in the first six contests before starting at that spot the last seven. He was part of an offensive line that enabled Da'Rel Scott (1,133) to become the seventh Terp back, and first since Chris Downs in 2002, to gain over 1,000 rushing yards. In week 7 of the season, Campbell earned ACC Lineman of the Week honors for his performance against Wake Forest. Professional career On December 18, 2009, Campbell announced his decision to enter the 2010 NFL Draft. =Oakland Raiders= Campbell was selected by the Oakland Raiders in the fourth round (106th overall) of the 2010 NFL Draft, despite many draft analysts, such as Mel Kiper Jr. and Scott Wright, who thought he would be selected in the top 10. He was reunited with former Maryland teammate Darrius Heyward-Bey. Before training camp started former head coach Tom Cable moved Campbell inside to play right guard on the Raiders' offensive line. On July 21, 2011, Campbell confirmed that he would be moving back outside to play his native position offensive tackle on the Raiders' offensive line under former head coach Hue Jackson's power blocking scheme. He never started any of his 14 games with Oakland. =Carolina Panthers= Campbell was acquired by the Carolina Panthers on March 30, 2012 in a trade that sent RB Mike Goodson to the Oakland Raiders. On August 24, 2013, he was waived/injured by the Panthers. =Washington Redskins= On March 12, 2014, Campbell signed a one-year deal with the Washington Redskins. However, his deal was voided on March 13, 2014 after he failed his team physical. =New York Jets= The New York Jets signed Campbell on August 5, 2014. He was released on August 23, 2014. =Toronto Argonauts= On March 20, 2015, Campbell signed with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League. =Saskatchewan Roughriders= Campbell was acquired by the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League via a trade with the Toronto Argonauts on Feb. 10, 2016, only to be soon followed by his retirement from the CFL on May 2, 2016. He was released on February 14, 2017. When Campbell regained the urge to play football, he re-signed with the Roughriders on June 23, 2017. On August 13, 2017, Campbell made his debut with Saskatchewan starting at left tackle. He was released on February 13, 2018.

She was a member of the England squad for the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup Finals. In a long association with Millwall Lionesses, Waller served the club as a player, coach, development officer, secretary and chairperson. Club career In 1995, Waller was playing for Millwall Lionesses. She won both the 1996–97 FA Women's Premier League Cup and FA Women's Cup with Millwall. In the final of the latter competition, Waller headed the winning goal from Justine Lorton's corner, in front of 3,015 supporters at Upton Park. Waller was also part of Millwall's 1991 FA Cup winning team, one of two senior players to remain with the club when most players left in the aftermath of the victory. Many young players who emerged at Millwall in the following years, including Katie Chapman, had been coached by Waller in the club's youth teams. In 1993 Waller had been heavily involved in the creation of the country's first girls' Centre of Excellence at Millwall. She had joined the club as a 12-year-old and by February 1997 had made over 400 appearances for the Lionesses. When the club was promoted back to the top division in 2009, Waller—by now the chairperson—claimed they were \\"back where we belong\\". Waller spent two summers playing in the Finnish Naisten SM-sarja for HJK Helsinki in 1988 and 1989. Lionesses manager Alan Wooler also played in Finland and arranged the move through his contacts. For her second season in Helsinki, Waller was joined by England teammate Marieanne Spacey. International career Waller was a member of the England squad for the 1995 Women's World Cup. Her only appearance came as a late substitute for Tina Mapes in the final game, a 3–0 quarter final defeat against Germany. Having joined the squad in 1989, Waller made over 30 appearances for England. Her final cap came in a 4–0 friendly defeat to Norway in June 1997. During qualification for UEFA Women's Euro 1993, Waller was sent off for handball as England crashed 3–0 to Italy at Millmoor, losing the tie 6–2 on aggregate and missing out on the four-team final tournament.

Life He was son of Robert II de Stuteville (from Estouteville in Normandy), one of the northern barons who commanded the English at the battle of the Standard in August 1138. His grandfather, Robert Grundebeof, had supported Robert of Normandy at the battle of Tinchebray in 1106, where he was taken captive and kept in prison for the rest of his life. Robert de Stuteville, the third, occurs as witness to a charter of Henry II of England on 8 January 1158 at Newcastle-on-Tyne. He was a justice itinerant in the counties of Cumberland and Northumberland in 1170–1171, and High Sheriff of Yorkshire from Easter 1170 to Easter 1175. The king's Knaresborough Castle and Appleby Castle were in his custody in April 1174, when they were captured by David of Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon. Stuteville, with his brothers and sons, was active in support of the king during the war of 1174, and he took a prominent part in the capture of William the Lion at Alnwick on 13 July (Rog. Hov. ii. 60). He was one of the witnesses to the Spanish award on 16 March 1177, and from 1174 to 1181 was constantly in attendance on the king, both in England and abroad. He seems to have died in the early part of 1186. He claimed the barony, which had been forfeited by his grandfather, from Roger de Mowbray, who by way of compromise gave him Kirby Moorside. He is the probable founder of the nunneries of Keldholme and Rosedale, Yorkshire, and was a benefactor of Rievaulx Abbey. Family Stuteville by his wife, Helewise de Murdac, he had two sons William and Nicholas and two daughters, Burga, who was married to William de Vesci and Helewise, who was married firstly to William de Lancaster, secondly to Hugh de Morville and thirdly to William de Greystoke. He may have also had sons Robert, Eustace and Osmund. Robert de Stuteville was probably brother of the Roger de Stuteville who was sheriff of Northumberland from 1170 to 1185, and defended Wark on Tweed Castle against William the Lion in 1174. Roger received charge of Edinburgh Castle in 1177, and he built the first Burton Agnes Manor House.Lewis, C.P. (2006) Anglo- norman Studies 28: Proceedings ... Boydell Press pg 71 (via Google) However Roger may have been his kinsman, not his brother, as son of Osmund de Stuteville (b. about 1125, of Burton Agnes, Yorkshire, England, d. before Sep 1202) and his wife (m. abt 1146) Isabel de Gressinghall, daughter of William Fitz Roger de Gressinghall.

One of his first works were the Swakopmund Railway Station, built in 1901, and the Swakopmund Lighthouse (1902). Also in Windhoek, his buildings today are all famous landmarks. The three castles of Windhoek, Heinitzburg, Schwerinsburg and Sanderburg, are what he is best known for here but he also built the Gathemann and Erkrath buildings and was involved in the erection of the Tintenpalast.

During the filming of The Human Centipede, many crew members and leading actors described Laser as being a method actor. On the days of filming he did not speak to the cast very often and would stay in character as much as he possibly could. Director Tom Six cast him after being impressed with Laser's work in some of his earlier films. For his performance, Laser won Best Actor at the Austin Fantastic Fest and was nominated for the LA Scream Awards for Best Villain in 2010. He returned for the final installment of the franchise after refusing to play the part at first. Laser starred in the Estonian fantasy film November (shot November 2015).

L. bufonivora is commonly referred to as a toadfly. The adult flies will typically feed on pollen and nectar of flowers, while the larvae are parasitoids that feed mainly on the living flesh of the common toad (Bufo bufo), leading to the toad's death, though they have been found as parasites on other frog and toad species. It is common in north west Europe. Description The adult toadfly has large brown compound eyes, a bright metallic green thorax and abdomen clad with bristly black hairs and a pair of membraneous, dark veined, translucent wings. The larvae are creamy white maggots similar to those of other blow flies that are found on dead animals and rotting meat. Parasitism alt=Common Toad A Common Toad Bufo bufo infected with larvae of Lucilia bufonivora. The nostrils of the toad have been destroyed by the larvae already. The adult toadfly lays its eggs on the skin at the entrance to the nostrils of the common toad although it has been known to infest other frog and toad species. It often preferentially chooses sick or injured individuals. On hatching, the larvae start to feed on the tissue of the nostrils and work their way into the nasal cavities. The larvae grow rapidly and as their appetite increases, they start to consume the eyes, the brain and other tissues of the host. Toad underwater with Larvae of lucillia bufonivora, the nostrils of the toad have already been destroyed by the larvae. Alternatively, the eggs may be laid in wounds and eat the hosts flesh. When the toad has died and the larvae have totally consumed its tissues and finished their development, they make their way into the soil and pupate. The larvae are sensitive to temperature and only thrive between 14 °C and 29 °C. If they are cooled below this range they will stop feeding and attempt to leave the host and bury themselves shallowly in the soil to hibernate. In a study in the Netherlands, it was found that the fly selectively targeted larger toads, with no juveniles and very few one-year-olds being affected. Overall, 8% of the toads examined were hosts to the toadfly larvae and would later have died, indicating that the activities of this parasite have a significant effect on the toad population.

NPE scholars treat economic ideologies as the relevant phenomena to be explained by political economy. Thus, Charles S. Maier suggests that a political economy approach: \\"interrogates economic doctrines to disclose their sociological and political premises [...] in sum, [it] regards economic ideas and behavior not as frameworks for analysis, but as beliefs and actions that must themselves be explained\\".Charles S. Mayer \\"In search of Stability: Explorations in Historical Political Economy\\", Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1987, pp.3–6. This approach shapes Andrew Gamble's The Free Economy and the Strong State (Palgrave Macmillan, 1988), and Colin Hay's The Political Economy of New Labour (Manchester University Press, 1999). It also guides much work published in New Political Economy, an international journal founded by Sheffield University scholars in 1996.cf: David Baker, \\"The political economy of fascism: Myth or reality, or myth and reality?\\" New Political Economy, Volume 11, Issue 2 June 2006, pp.227–250. Matthew Watson with Richard Higgott, in explicit response to Benjamin Cohen's approach, seek to move International Political Economy away from Cohen's division of the subject into American and British camps, and to promote their own vision of a New Political Economy.Richard Higgott and Matthew Watson (2008) \\"All at sea in a barbed wire canoe: Professor Cohen’s transatlantic voyage in IPE\\", Review of International Political Economy, 15 (1), 2008, 1-17. They propose: # Transgresses conventional social science boundaries. # Explicitly rejects the loaded connotations of the 'rigour' that Cohen espouses, as this engenders unhelpful methodological competition. # Resists the abstractionism of postmodernism in favour of the progressive principle that life might be made better. This ‘new political economy’ attempts to combine the approach of the classical political economists (from Smith to Marx) with more recent \\"analytical advances\\". Authors adopting this approach include Gamble (1996),Gamble, Andrew (1996) \\"The New Political Economy\\", Political Studies, 43 (3): 516-530.

The New Political Economy of Globalisation, Two Volumes, Aldershot: Edward Elgar. The approach \\"rejects the old dichotomies – between agency and structure, between ideas and material interests, and between states and markets\\".Robert E. Goodin, Philip Pettit, Thomas W. Pogge (eds), A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy, John Wiley & Sons, 2012, p. 167. The approach seeks to make explicit the normative assumptions that lie behind its analysis, and to be a \\"hosting metaphor\\" that will encourage political debate about societal preferences. It considers that different levels of abstraction are needed to \\"deeply ground\\" work in historical, cultural and social detail, thereby fostering a 'real world' political economy able to explain the influence of social meanings - of both actions and objects - on economic choices. Watson and Higgott argue that practitioners of this approach are gradually increasing in number. They note the prevalence of NPE not only among \\"Third World economic nationalists and academic critics of the neo-liberal policy agenda who find little comfort in the turn instead to anti- foundationalist theories associated with postmodernism\\", but also among many \\"mainstream\\" economists who have become disillusioned with neoclassical theory.

It is a gravel road, has a remarkable maximum gradient of 1:6, an elevation of 2236m above sea level at the highest point and is possibly the fourth highest mountain pass in South Africa. The three higher mountain passes are also situated in the Senqu Municipal area and they are Naude's Neck Pass at 2590m, Carlislehoekspruit Pass at 2517m and Volenteershoek Pass at 2381m above sea level. Close on the heels of Joubert's pass, is Baster Voetslaan Pass at an elevation of 2235m, Lundean's Neck Pass at 2165m, Otto Du Plessis Pass at 2114m and Barkly Pass at 2020m. These 8 passes, of which 5 are possibly the highest in South Africa, make up the well known “8 Passes Challenge” of the North Eastern Cape. (Elevation of these passes supplied by Ivan Hansen, Land Surveyor from Queenstown.) Joubert's Pass is situated on a road that turns out eastward from the tarred R58 after passing through Lady Grey at , crosses the Witteberg (white mountain due to the crest often covered in snow during winter), a branch of the Drakensberg (dragon mountain), meanders through farmlands and meets up again with the tarred R58 that links Aliwal North to Barkly East at . Before the existence of Joubert's pass, farmers on the other side of Witteberg had to take a long detour to get to Lady Grey. A survey was done for the construction of a road from Lady Grey Nek to cross the mountain via the farm Burnet to Gairtney. It was estimated that such a road would cost at least between five and six thousand pounds. The route travelled today (Joubert's pass) was considered an impassable one – only fit for baboons. About 40 years after the survey, farmers from the other side of the mountain decided that enough was enough and took the matter into their own hands. Seven farmers of which five had the surname Joubert took up their implements and proceeded to construct a wagon road as they saw fit. The others were Stephenson and Cloete. This passage through the mountains was built using only manual labour. The most difficult part of the road, a length of six miles, had been constructed for the sum of £1156 10s and a further six miles or so had been made for £50. The enterprise of this syndicate would take some beating. Helvellyn, once fifty miles by road from Lady Grey, is now only seven, Ossa fifteen instead of 35, and other farms in proportion. They ended up with one of the highest mountain passes in South Africa. The opening ceremony took place on 17 December 1914. This was a red letter day for Lady Grey. A procession of spiders, carts and buggies started from the Central Hotel at 8:10 and they reached the summit in a little over an hour and a half. The ladies were exceedingly hospitable and provided good things in such quantities that the guests' powers were unequal to the occasion, consequently much of the supplies had to be carried home again. At least 80 Ladies and Gentlemen were present. The Mayor, Mr. Lilford formally opened the road under the name of “Joubert's Pass.” The stone tablet on the top of the pass credits five Jouberts: Gideon (Sr.), Daniel Francois, Christiaan de Wet, Gideon (Jr.) and Johannes Marthinus Joubert, plus George Friedrich Stephenson and Cornelius Willem Cloete. The initials MP at the bottom stand for Moos Pieterse, who also carved many of the headstones in the old cemetery in Lady Grey.

Raised in late 1939 as part of the all volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force, the battalion's initial recruits were drawn primarily from the states of Queensland and Tasmania. Assigned to the 18th Brigade, the battalion completed basic training in Australia before embarking for overseas in May 1940. It was originally intended that the battalion would land in the Middle East; however, the strategic situation in Europe at the time resulted in it being diverted to the United Kingdom where it formed part of Australia's contribution to the defence of the island during a period when an invasion seemed likely. When this threat passed, the 2/12th was sent to North Africa, and in 1941 it took part in the defence of Tobruk and then undertook garrison duties in Syria, before returning to Australia in early 1942. In August 1942, the battalion fought in the Battle of Milne Bay, turning back a Japanese invasion force there, before capturing Goodenough Island before returning to Australia in early 1943. The 2/12th returned to New Guinea in August 1943, and subsequently took part in the Finisterre Range campaign into early 1944. Its final campaign came in mid-1945 when it was committed to re-capturing Borneo, landing on Balikpapan in July 1945. It was disbanded in January 1946. History =Formation and garrison duties in the United Kingdom= The 2/12th Battalion was formed on 13 October 1939 as part of the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) and was attached to the 18th Brigade, which was variously assigned throughout the course of the war to three of the four 2nd AIF divisions—the 6th, 9th and finally, the 7th. Over half of the battalion's personnel were drawn from volunteers from north Queensland, while the rest came from Tasmania. A a result initial training was undertaken separately at Brighton, Tasmania, and Redbank, Queensland, before the battalion concentrated at Rutherford, New South Wales, in December 1939, with the Tasmanian contingent sailing from Launceston aboard the SS Taroona.Graeme-Evans 1989, p. 11. Upon establishment, the battalion's commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel John Field, who had previously served in the Militia, Australia's part-time military force.Graeme-Evans 1989, p. 1. The colours chosen for the battalion's unit colour patch (UCP) were the same as those of the 12th Battalion, a unit which had served during World War I before being raised as a Militia formation in 1921. These colours were white over light blue, in a horizontal rectangular shape, although a border of gray was added to the UCP to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart.Long 1952, pp. 321–323. Reinforcements from the 2/12th in England, November 1940 With an authorised strength of around 900 personnel, like other Australian infantry battalions of the time, the battalion was formed around a nucleus of four rifle companies – designated 'A' through to 'D' – each consisting of three platoons.Long 1952, p. 52. Basic training continued at Rutherford until early January 1940, when the battalion moved to Ingleburn, New South Wales.Graeme-Evans 1989, pp. 13–17. Apart from a brief period of embarkation leave, the battalion remained at Ingleburn until 5 May 1940 when the 2/12th embarked upon the Queen Mary,Graeme-Evans 1989, p. 25. bound for the Middle East, along with the rest of the 18th Brigade, where they were to join the 6th Division; however, due to concerns about a possible invasion of the United Kingdom following the Fall of France, the 18th Brigade,Johnston 2005, p. 4. including the 2/12th Battalion, was re-routed and subsequently arrived at Gourock, Scotland, on 17 June 1940. Later, they were moved to Salisbury Plain, being stationed around Lopcombe Corner, where they undertook defensive duties. In September the battalion was re-allocated to the 9th Division and the following month it was moved to Colchester, Essex. =Middle East= In December 1940, after the threat of invasion of the United Kingdom had diminished, the decision was made to transfer the Australian units based there to the Middle East and subsequently the battalion was dispatched to Egypt, sailing aboard the transport Empress of Canada.Graeme-Evans 1989, p. 75. Sailing via South Africa to avoid the more dangerous waters of the Mediterranean, they disembarked at Alexandria on 31 December and then made camp at Ikingi Maryut.Graeme-Evans 1989, p. 83. In March, the battalion's medium machine gun section and anti-aircraft platoon provided support to the 2/9th Battalion during its attack on the Italian garrison at Giarabub.Graeme- Evans 1989, p. 93. The battalion as a whole subsequently saw action at Tobruk between May and August along with the rest of the 18th Brigade,Wilmot 1993, pp. 88, 150–151 and 280. before being relieved by a Polish unit and evacuated by sea to Alexandria in August 1941 aboard the destroyer HMS Jackal.Graeme- Evans 1989, p. 201. After this, the battalion moved to Biet Jirja and then Kilo 89, in Palestine, where they undertook further training until late September. Following the completion of the Syria-Lebanon campaign, the battalion was assigned to Syria to undertake garrison duties, being based initially around Aleppo and then Djerablous, on the banks of the Euphrates near the Turkish border.Johnston 2005, p. 71. Other outposts were established around Idlib, El Hamman, Meidane Ekbes, Azaz, and Radjou.Graeme-Evans 1989, pp. 217–235. The battalion returned to Camp Julius in Palestine in mid-January 1942 where they were subsequently reassigned to the 7th Division. With the strategic situation in the Pacific worsening for the Australians after the entry of Japan into the war following the attack on Pearl Harbor and the invasion of Malaya, the decision was made by the Australian government to bring some of the 2nd AIF troops back to Australia at this time.Johnston 2005, p. 77. As a result, the 2/12th embarked from Suez in February 1942. Sailing aboard the transport Nieuw Amsterdam, via Bombay and Fremantle, they subsequently arrived at Adelaide, South Australia, in late March, making camp at Sandy Creek.Graeme-Evans 1989, pp. 236–242. =Pacific= Troops from the 2/12th at Sanananda, January 1943 The battalion moved to Tenterfield, New South Wales in early May after which personnel from Queensland and New South Wales were granted home leave. Later in the month, a further move to Kilcoy, Queensland, occurred after which jungle training began.Graeme-Evans 1991, pp. 19–23. In August 1942, the 2/12th Battalion was transported to Brisbane where it embarked upon the transports Anshun and Jacob, bound for New Guinea.Graeme- Evans 1991, p. 29. They were subsequently deployed to Milne Bay, where they took part in the Australian counterattack following the Japanese landing, which resulted in the first major defeat of the Japanese of the war.Johnston 2005, p. 92. In October, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Arnold, the battalion was selected to invade Goodenough Island. Transported aboard the destroyers HMAS Stuart and Arunta,Gill 1968, p. 182. after a short fight the battalion secured the island. They subsequently remained on Goodenough Island until December. In late December, they were re-committed to the fighting, as the understrength 18th Brigade was sent to Buna,Johnston 2005, p. 124. where the 2/12th successfully attacked Giropa Point on New Years Day 1943, despite losing 63 men killed and 122 wounded. After this, the battalion took part in further actions around Sanananda, where they suffered a further 61 men killed in action. The battalion's involvement in the fighting lasted until late January 1943 when it was withdrawn to Soputa by road, and then by air to Port Moresby. In early March, the battalion returned to Australia aboard the transports Taroona and Maetsuycker.Graeme-Evans 1991, pp. 325–331. Disembarking in Cairns, Queensland, the battalion subsequently made camp at Ravenshoe, Queensland. Following a period of rest, training and re- organisation, in July 1943 the battalion received a batch of reinforcements from the 5th Motor Regiment, which had been disbanded. A small batch of reinforcements also came from 2/40th Battalion personnel who had evaded capture in Timor.Graeme-Evans 1991, pp. 331–337 & 391. In August 1943, the 2/12th were sent to Port Moresby, where the 18th Brigade was being held in divisional reserve,Bradley 2004, p. 179. while the rest of the 7th Division defended the approaches to Lae as part of the Finisterre Range campaign.Johnston 2005, p. 181. On the last day of the year, the battalion was committed to the fighting in Finisterre Mountains. They were subsequently joined by the rest of the brigade on 4 January 1944 when it was airlifted to Dumpu to relieve the 21st Brigade.Keogh 1965, p. 352. Throughout early 1944, the 2/12th was involved in the fighting around Shaggy Ridge, where they undertook several attacks to the north of the ridge, around the Protheroe I and II features between 21 and 24 January. Between February and April, they continued operations in the Ramu Valley, undertaking patrols before returning to Australia aboard the transport Pahud in May 1944.Graeme-Evans 1991, p. 395.Johnston 2005, p. 207.

The battalion's involvement in the fighting on Borneo was only brief, however. Despite being landed in the wrong position on 1 July,Long 1963, p. 515. the 2/12th secured its objectives with very few casualties—losing three killed and 13 wounded and inflicting 103 killed on the opposing Japanese forces on the first day—helping the 18th Brigade secure the high ground overlooking the landing beach at Klandasan before continuing on towards their main objectives. By 3 July Balikpapan had fallen,Keogh 1965, p. 462. and two days later the battalion ceased active operations. They remained on Borneo until the end of the war. When the demobilisation process began, members of the battalion were progressively returned to Australia for discharge, or were transferred elsewhere for further service. Those that were not, remained with the battalion undertaking garrison duties until the 2/12th was finally disbanded on 1 January 1946.

P. Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith, and August Derleth. Shea was born in Dayton, Kentucky, the son of a professional magician. According to an obituary published in a 1981 issue of Crispin Burnham's Eldritch Tales, Shea's father had been a friend of such famous stage magicians as Howard Thurston, Hermann the Great, Houdini and Blackstone. He began writing fiction and poetry around the age of 13. His letters to Weird Tales magazine also appeared in print from around that time. At the age of 19, in 1931, Shea sent some of his early efforts to H.P. Lovecraft for criticism. Shea at that time resided in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and apparently entered the University of Pittsburgh, but had to drop out after a year because of financial considerations.S. T. Joshi and David E. Schulz, eds. H. P. Lovecraft: Letters to J. Vernon Shea, Carl F. Strauch, and Lee McBride White. NY: Hippocampus Press, 2016, p. 8 The correspondence lasted from 1931-37. Lovecraft's side of the correspondence has now been published in full in S. T. Joshi and David E. Schulz, eds. H. P. Lovecraft: Letters to J. Vernon Shea, Carl F. Strauch, and Lee McBride White. NY: Hippocampus Press, 2016 , pp. 15–295. Shea later served overseas in the Army Medical Corps, then returned to civilian life and worked as a metallurgist in Cleveland, Ohio. In the 1960s he donated what he believed to be all his letters from Lovecraft to the John Hay Library, but ten more letters were later found amongst his effects. He was a long-time member of the \\"Esoteric Order of Dagon\\" Amateur Press Association at the time of his sudden accidental death.S. T. Joshi, David E.

His career as an artist is characterised by an intense and remarkably versatile activity. Like many of his contemporaries, the representatives of so-called 1980s generation in the Estonian art, Karmin received professional training in the Estonian Academy of Art, which was thorough, yet traditional, not to say conservative according to the international criteria. During his studies, Estonian sculpture was predominantly figurative and employed traditional materials like stone and bronze. Karmin, on the other hand, has been creating almost all his independent work in a rapidly charging art scene, which is characterised by the denial of traditions, the disputation of values, and blurring of borders between the art forms as well as art and its surrounding space. The notion of sculpture itself has undergone an especially radical transformation. Karmin has reacted to the changing situation perhaps in more dynamic, yet also controversial manner than the majority of Estonian artists. Vibrant creativity, with a very professional plastic thinking and perfect material perception at its heart, has allowed him to act as a traditionalist as well an innovator, achieving outstanding results in both areas. Besides traditional materials, primarily bronze, Karmin has taken inspiration from unconventional solutions and employed innovative materials right from the beginning of his career. Early on, he caught attention with one of his first exhibited sculptures, “Military Fox” (1981), cleverly formed of corroded scrap metal details. Scrap metal has frequently emerged as an important material and source of inspiration also in the later work of Karmin. Up to mid-1990s, he used scrap metal basically within the borders of the traditional notion of sculpture. By that we think of figures and decorative forms that communicate with space, like the conventional free sculpture, and that are meant to be placed on a platform. Having previously only tentatively touched the borders of the classical notion of sculpture, Karmin in 1994 surprised the public with an epochal conceptual installation “My Father”, taking as the material the career and extensive collection of weeds of his father who was an agricultural researcher. Within the same period falls also the display of impressive construction site cabins of corroded metal on the green area in front of The Tallinn Art Hall Gallery during the group exhibition of innovative sculptors. One of the most grandiose manifestations of the exploring line of Karmin's work is the underwater mine furniture project that began five years ago. On the northern coast of Estonia - especially the islands - there were numerous heaps of corroded mine shells, which are basically spheres with holes, spires and shackles. Karmin got inspired by these mines and started to collect them. The ambiguity of large scale corroded mine shells intrigued the artist. The shape of the mine is perfect and uniform, while still clearly bearing the stamp of its initial destructive function. Being marked by its belonging to the past, it is closely connected to the complicated recent history that Karmin has always been fascinated with. Karmin's entire work has relied on various contradictions. He entered the Estonian sculpture scene as an innovator and the continuity of that trait in his creative biography persists, however the notion of classical sculpture and the classical material for sculpture – bronze – is still very important to him and he has time and again returned to it whether in free sculpture or monumental sculpture. Mine furniture, despite its unprecedented novelty, brings together the two directions in the artist's work. It can be clearly sensed how the artist has enjoyed playing with materials and forms, having developed both its meanings and looks, creating a versatile series, based on contradictions and contrasts. Karmin uses mines as modules. The entire furniture series is composed of only two existing basic forms of mines – the hemisphere and the cylinder. He has created utility articles of diverse forms, resulting in armchairs, writing desks, beds, toilets, cupboards, bathtubs, swings, fireplaces, and more. He has added to the scrap metal hand-treated copper details, metal mesh, leather upholstery and granite and glass surfaces, thus consciously increasing the semantic contradiction of objects. At the end of the mine project, the artist created a mobile sculpture out of a Soviet military truck. His vehicle has instead of a rocket a gigantic phallus of mine shells towering above, with four clocks at its top, showing time in four geographic places of the world – Moscow, London, Paris and New York.

Onesacre Hall is a Grade II* Listed building situated in the rural outskirts of the City of Sheffield in South Yorkshire, England. The hall is located on Green Lane in the small hamlet of Onesacre in the suburb of Oughtibridge, north west of the city centre. History The present Onesacre Hall has no exact date of construction but is believed to have been built in the early and middle parts of the 17th century, however Onesacre itself is a hamlet of some antiquity, it was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 and before that was part of the estate of the Saxon Lord, Godric. In the Domesday Book the hamlet is spelt Anesacre meaning \\"The Field of An\\" and comes from the Old Norse language. Onesacre was originally created as a forest clearing on high ground above the Don valley by Norwegian settlers.\\"The Making of South Yorkshire\\", David Hey, , Page 24, States that Onesacre was founded by Norwegians. After the Norman Conquest the Onesacre lands were owned by the Le Rous family who were probably of Norman descent. Around 1380 the lands passed to the Stead family when Alice Le Rous, the sole heiress married John Stead of Wentworth. Rootsweb at Ancestry.com. Gives early history of Onesacre and the Steads. The Steads were to become substantial landowners throughout South Yorkshire and owned the Onesacre estate for over 400 years until the year 1794, they were also connected to the nearby Hillsborough House and Burrowlee House. It was Nicholas Stead (1583-1639) and his son Thomas (1619–86) who instigated the building of the gabled and mullioned Onesacre Hall using the master mason John Hawley of nearby Thorn House Farm to construct the hall. The building was done in two phases the first being 1630 -1640 and the second between 1660 -1670. In 1672 the Steads were taxed on six hearths at the hall. After the Steads left Onesacre Hall in 1794 it became a farm with a writer commenting in 1862, The hall was divided into two farmhouses. One was Tophill Farm. The other was rented by Mr. Joe Wood who delivered milk to Oughtibridge and the surrounding district. The hall fell into disrepair during the second half of the 20th century and substantial renovation work has turned the hall into two private dwellings.

It is native to the New World, but has been extirpated from the United States and Canada, having not been recorded since 1998. In the Neotropics, it can be found from Mexico to northern Argentina. The larva is considered a pest of cotton. They feed on the leaves, twigs, and buds. Taxonomy Alabama argillacea is the only species in the monotypic genus Alabama, which was erected by Augustus Radcliffe Grote in 1895. The species was first described by Jacob Hübner in 1823. The Global Lepidoptera Names Index gives this name as a synonym of Anomis Hübner, [1821]  Description  The adult moth has light brown to orange wings. It wingspan varies from 25–35 mm. The larvae are up to 40 mm long, green or brownish with black and white stripes. They have a characteristic pattern of black dots on each segment.  Life cycle  Alabama argillacea is a specialist feeder on Gossypieae, which includes cotton and its close relatives. Like other anomine erebids, its distribution is primarily tropical and only migrates north in the summer and fall under favorable conditions. Its eggs are sensitive and cannot tolerate any amount of frost in the winter, restricting the adults to historically spend the winter in Florida and Texas. However, its eggs may have never overwintered at all in the United States. Any adults which found themselves up north in the fall would have died by the first frost. Females lay an average of 400 eggs, which is unusually high for a noctuoid. The entirety of the damage done to cotton is done by the larvae. Young instars feed primarily the underside of the leaves, skeletonizing them as they feed. Older instars move vertically and feed on the younger, fresher foliage near the bolls and sometimes on the bolls themselves. Depending on latitude, two to eight generations could have occurred in the United States each year. This made them an especially dangerous pest, as they fed year-round in some locations. In especially bad years, the larvae destroyed over a third of cotton crops. This resulted in the United States losing almost $30 million a year in lost profits (over $700 million in today's terms). Adults feed at flowers of many different species, but are probably not significant pollinators. Being a migratory species, the population of Alabama argillacea varied drastically from year-to- year and even location-to-location. No reliable records of A. argillacea exist from before 1793. The largest outbreaks occurred in 1804, 1825, 1846, 1868, and 1873, with intervening years having very minimal damage. Much effort went into predicting when and where the caterpillars would strike next, but this research generated very little in terms of accurate predicting tools. When it struck, the destruction was nothing short of complete. In a letter to The American Agriculturalist in September 1846, farmer Thomas Affleck gave the following account of the destruction of A. argillacea: > The Caterpillar ... has utterly blighted the hopes of the cotton-planter for > the present year, and produced most anxious fears for the future. I have > heard from the greater part of the cotton-growing region—the news is all > alike—the worm has destroyed the crop. I have no idea that any considerable > portion of any State will escape. ... The fields present a most melancholy > appearance by looking from the bluff at Natchez across the river to those > fine plantations back of Vidalia, nothing is to be seen but the brown > withered skeleton of the plant.  Control  Before the advent of organic insecticides in the 1940s, outbreaks of Alabama argillacea went largely unchecked. Riley (1885) provides a detailed account of dozens of different methods used to attempt to kill Alabama argillacea. Some were simple, such as killing the larvae by hand or allowing poultry to roam through the cotton fields and eat the larvae they find. Later patented methods were more complicated: a sweeping-plow that brushed larvae off the leaves and buried them underground, light traps which used chemical compounds to kill adults, and soaking cotton seeds in poison under the false belief that the eggs were laid in the seeds. Still other methods were counterproductive. At least one farmer was so distraught by the damage caused A. argillacea that he built dozens of large bonfires around his fields in the hopes that the adult moths would be attracted to the light and destroy themselves in the flames. As it turned out, moths were attracted to the flames, but did not fly into them. All the farmer ended up doing was attracting additional moths to his property from miles away.  Extirpation from North America  When large amounts of these insecticides were applied to cotton crops in southern Texas early in the cotton-growing season, the population of A. argillacea would take so long to build up such that any migration that occurred north later in the season became insignificant. It was not long after this that A. argillacea became rare to see north of the Rio Grande. By the 1970s some states were seeing the moth for the last time. The last confirmed record for New York came in 1977, for Pennsylvania in 1968, and for North Carolina in 1973. The last confirmed United States record was collected in October 1998 in Louisiana. In addition to insecticides, state and local agencies created programs to destroy wild cotton when it was found on non-agricultural lands. This was done to prevent the spread and reservoir of cotton pests. Because of this, several native species of cotton are now on protected species lists. Finally, the Americas have seen a general shift away from cotton as a significant cash crop. This is because cotton is pesticide- and labor-intensive, returns less of a profit than alternative synthetic fiber products, and other crops have a higher demand.  Status in Central and South America  A. argillacea is still a major pest in South America, where agricultural practices have not caught up yet to those elsewhere. When the same management strategies are applied in South America, it likely will not be long until A. argillacea becomes truly extinct. Its only hope may ride on its ability to utilize Hampea spp. as a host.

Bellas and R.J. Duro in the Integrated Group for Engineering Research (GII) at the University of Coruña, in Spain. It evolves variable size feedforward artificial neural networks (ANN) that are encoded into sequences of genes for constructing a basic ANN unit. Each of these blocks is preceded by a gene promoter acting as an on/off switch that determines if that particular unit will be expressed or not. PBGA basics The basic unit in the PBGA is a neuron with all of its inbound connections as represented in the following figure: File:pbga2.jpg The genotype of a basic unit is a set of real valued weights followed by the parameters of the neuron and proceeded by an integer valued field that determines the promoter gene value and, consequently, the expression of the unit. By concatenating units of this type we can construct the whole network. With this encoding it is imposed that the information that is not expressed is still carried by the genotype in evolution but it is shielded from direct selective pressure, maintaining this way the diversity in the population, which has been a design premise for this algorithm. Therefore, a clear difference is established between the search space and the solution space, permitting information learned and encoded into the genotypic representation to be preserved by disabling promoter genes.

The parish is bounded to the southeast by the River Thame, to the east and north by the Thame's tributary Holton Brook, to the south by London Road and to the west by field boundaries with the parishes of Forest Hill with Shotover and Stanton St John. Manor Holton's toponym is derived from the Old English for \\"hidden nook\\". It is a Saxon village that was probably established in the 10th century. The Domesday Book records that in 1086 the Norman nobleman Roger d'Ivry was the manor of Holton's feudal overlord. In 1112 d'Ivry's last heir died and his estates passed to the Crown. The Crown granted Holton to the Saint Valery family, whereby it became part of the Honour of St Valery and later the Honour of Wallingford. By 1317 Holton had a manor house with a dovecote. During the English Civil War the Whorwood family that owned the manor and lived in the house were Royalists but in 1643 it was held by a Parliamentarian garrison that controlled Wheatley Bridge across the River Thame. In January 1647 a Parliamentarian commander, Henry Ireton, and Bridget, a daughter of Oliver Cromwell, were married at the manor house. A new dovecote was built for the manor house in the 17th century and new stables were added in the 18th century. By 1801 the house was a mostly 17th century building with traces of 15th century work. It was dilapidated and in 1805 it was demolished, but the stables, dovecote and moat of the old house all survive. A new Georgian neo-Gothic house, Holton Park, was built by Elisha Biscoe in the deer park of the demolished manor house between 1808 and 1815. In 1948 the Oxfordshire Education Committee bought Holton Park house and turned it into a girls' grammar school. It is now Wheatley Park School. Parish church The Church of England parish church of Saint Bartholomew was built in about 1200. It is cruciform and is in the transitional style between Norman architecture and Early English Gothic. Early in the 14th century its chancel was rebuilt and given a Decorated Gothic east window. The Gothic Revival architect E.G. Bruton built the rectory in 1882. St. Bartholomew's parish is now part of a single Church of England benefice with St. Mary's parish, Wheatley and the benefice is part of a local ecumenical partnership with Wheatley's Roman Catholic, United Reformed and free churches. Economic and social history The Domesday Book records that by 1086 Holton had a water mill. This may have been on the River Thame. The present mill is 17th century and is on the Thame upstream of Wheatley Bridge. Lyehill Quarry in the west of the parish belonged to Holton Manor. It was in use by the early part of the 15th century, when it supplied limestone for the building of Thomas Wolsey's Cardinal's College in Oxford. In 1684 Rev. Edward Rogers, Rector of Holton, died leaving £200 to be invested to provide an income to educate poor children of Holton. In 1787 classes were held in the Kings' Arms public house in Wheatley but by 1790 Holton had a purpose-built schoolhouse. It was run by the same schoolmaster, John Sawyer, from then until 1821, by which time he was so incompetent, old and deaf that he had lost all his pupils. The school was empty from then until it reopened with a new master in 1824. In 1833 it was only a boys' school but in 1835 a girls' and infants' school was opened. The two schools were merged by 1854 and the old building was demolished and replaced in 1861. Early in the 20th century pupil numbers declined and in 1915 the Oxfordshire Education Committee closed the school. During the Second World War a United States military hospital was built in Holton Park. The Lady Spencer-Churchill College of Education was built at Holton in 1966 and merged with Oxford Polytechnic in 1974. In 1992 the polytechnic became Oxford Brookes University. The former Lady Spencer-Churchill College is now Oxford Brookes' Wheatley Campus.

History Jackson was born in Brisbane, Queensland, and educated at Toowoomba Grammar School and in Grafton, New South Wales. From his youth he developed an interest in birds and in collecting their eggs. Based in Grafton, for many years he worked as a commercial traveller, giving him the opportunity to build up a large collection of birds' eggs.Mathews (1927).Whittell (1954), pp.369-372. Although his field activities were mainly focussed on bird and egg specimens, he also collected land snails and botanical specimens. He was a skillful tree-climber and developed, with the help of his brother Frank, techniques for climbing trees, using leg-spikes and rope-ladders, as aids to egg-collecting. Jackson contributed several papers to the RAOU journal The Emu. He was a diligent diarist, correspondent, photographer and talented sketcher, whose diaries, as well as much of his correspondence, photographic negatives and drawings, eventually found their way to the National Library of Australia in Canberra.Chisholm (1958), pp.101-102. He also authored a book, Egg Collecting and Bird Life of Australia, a combined autobiographical work and oological catalogue, illustrated with his own photographs, which was published in 1907. In 1906 Jackson had sold his collection of nearly 2000 eggs, representing over 500 species of Australian birds, to H.L. White, a wealthy pastoralist based at Scone, New South Wales who was a keen amateur ornithologist and oologist. In 1907 White then employed Jackson as curator of his collection of eggs and bird skins, as well as a collector of further specimens. During this period Jackson travelled extensively throughout Australia on quests to obtain specimens and eggs of various birds. Following White's death in 1927, Jackson moved to Sydney where he wrote popular illustrated articles on natural history for newspapers and magazines, mainly the Sydney Morning Herald and the World's News, using the pen name ‘Ajax’.Robin (2001). Ornithological historian Alec Chisholm, in an article about Jackson's diaries in The Emu, described Jackson, whom he knew personally, as follows: > ”Inevitably, the diaries and correspondence reflect the character of their > author. Jackson was an odd mixture. A keen observer and most diligent > worker, he was extremely temperamental – apt to be completely downcast at > one moment and thoroughly joyful soon afterwards.

It is located in the townland of Ballymacoll, approximately two miles from the village of Dunboyne and four miles (6 km) from the town of Maynooth. Under the ownership of Michael Sobell and Arnold Weinstock and his family, it produced 29 individual Group One (G1) winners of 52 Group 1 races between 1960 and 2017. The stud was sold at auction in June 2017 for €8.15 million to an undisclosed buyer. Ballymacoll Estate was founded by Henry Hamilton (1760–1844). It remained in Hamilton hands until January 1911, when it was sold to Lord Nugent. Other owners and tenants followed, including Boss Croker, the trainer, the Inchape Family, and the Irish Army (during World War II). In April 1946, the property was purchased by the Hon. Dorothy Paget, daughter of Lord Queenborough and Pauline (daughter of William C. Whitney). She owned the stud until her death in February 1960 at the age of 54. Despite owning the stud, Dorothy Paget never actually visited the farm herself, but she did from time to time receive detailed reports, illustrated with photographs. Sir Gordon Richards, had been Dorothy Paget's principal jockey and trainer, right up the time of her death. He was instrumental in persuading the then Mr. Michael Sobell, the industrialist and philanthropist (later Sir Michael Sobell), and his son-in-law, Sir Arnold Weinstock, Managing Director of G.E.C. (later Lord Weinstock) to buy the farm in June 1960. The price agreed for the farm, together with approximately 130 horses was £250,000. Following the purchase, horses surplus to requirements were sold at the Newmarket sales that year. In 1967 the main house at Ballymacoll, which had stood semi-derelict for many years was demolished. In 1974 Lord Weinstock's son, the Hon. Simon Weinstock became a partner in Ballymacoll with his father. Simon took a very active role in the running of the stud and took particular responsibility for the matings. Simon Weinstock died in May 1996, at the age of 44. Lord Weinstock died in July 2002, after which the stud was run by Weinstock's executors on behalf of his family as a self-sufficient operation. Soon after his death Islington won her first Group 1 race when winning the Nassau Stakes. She went on to win three more Group 1 races in 2002 and 2003. In 2004 North Light won the Epsom Derby to give the stud and Weinstock family their second success in this race. In recent years Ballymacoll have had added to their Group 1 record on the racetrack. In June 2008 Ballymacoll finished second in The Derby with Tartan Bearer. Conduit went on to win the St Leger at Doncaster in September. He then added to his Group 1 tally by winning the Breeders' Cup Turf at Santa Anita in October. In 2009 Conduit continued his Group 1 trail by winning the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot. This result completed a 1-2 for Ballymacoll with Tartan Bearer second (his third second place in Group 1 races). Conduit returned to Santa Anita on November 7, 2009 to repeat his feat of 12 months previously and take the Breeders' Cup Turf for a second time.

The pastor is Minister Cy Fields. The church is made up of hundreds of members. The members unite every Sunday for morning worship and praise. thumb History and architecture The beginning took place in January, 1946. The first meeting was held in the living room of Deacon Sample Lawler on 2934 W. Fulton St. in Chicago. The meeting began to progress and then were held in the home of Mrs. Ella McCarthy. These meetings soon grew to become prayer services held by a group of believers. The believers present were Deacon Lawler, Sister Lawler, Brother and Sister Will Elliot, and Brother and Sister Dave McCarthy. LMBC (Landmark Missionary Baptist Church) was established on May 13, 1946, under the leadership of Reverend Grant Tilford. Starting off with approximately twenty-five members, three trustees, and four deacons, the church continued to grow. LMBC’s growth later forced the move to 2300 W. Lake St. in Chicago Illinois. In 1947 the church purchased its first building on 1751 W. Lake St. The Church board consisted of Deacon Lawler as chairman of Deacons, an organized Missionary Society, Sunday school, and the Willing Worker Club. In 1952 Rev. Grant Tilford resigned as pastor. In February 1953, after serving as acting pastor, Rev. Dr. Joseph Sylvester was ordained and called to serve as pastor. In 1953, LMBC bought an empty lot space on the corner of Wilcox and Washtenaw as a site for a new “church home”. The building process was finished a year later and on November 28, 1954, Rev. Sylvester and thirty-five members marched into the new church. Landmark missionary Baptist church became the second Baptist church to be built on the Westside of Chicago. The current sanctuary and the three story educational building were finished in the year of 1975 at the cost of $400,000.00. By 1979 Landmark Missionary Baptist Church was paid in full. Landmark continued to grow under the leadership of Rev. Sylvester. Many clubs and auxiliaries were created to support and advance the church. The church bought a bus, elevator, real estate property and other enhancements. In November 1993, California Ave from Lake Street to Ogden was renamed the “Reverend Dr. Joseph Sylvester Street” in honor of his many contributions to the community. On May 15, 2001, after 48 years of pasturing Landmark Rev. Dr. Joseph Sylvester died, leaving behind a “rich legacy”. In the month of July in 2000 Minister Cy Maynard Fields, an associate Minister, became the Interim (temporary) pastor. On June 17, 2001, he was collectively elected as pastor of Landmark. Min. Fields was “sworn in” by Reverend Wilson Daniels of United Baptist Church on July 29, 2001. On March 1, 2003, the church name Landmark Missionary Baptist Church was changed to New Landmark Missionary Baptist Church. Church properties New Landmark Missionary Baptist Church owns six residential buildings and has four empty lots in which they are used for parking vehicles. The church's architectural form was created so that the church could be connected to one of the residential buildings that it owns. The building is known as the 2710 building.

Thus the notion of contiguity extends the concept of absolute continuity to the sequences of measures. The concept was originally introduced by as part of his contribution to the development of abstract general asymptotic theory in mathematical statistics. Le Cam was instrumental during the period in the development of abstract general asymptotic theory in mathematical statistics. He is best known for the general concepts of local asymptotic normality and contiguity.Wolfowitz J.(1974) Review of the book: \\"Contiguity of Probability Measures: Some Applications in Statistics. by George G. Roussas\\", Journal of the American Statistical Association, 69, 278-279 jstor Definition Let (\\\\Omega_n,\\\\mathcal{F}_n) be a sequence of measurable spaces, each equipped with two measures Pn and Qn. * We say that Qn is contiguous with respect to Pn (denoted ) if for every sequence An of measurable sets, implies . * The sequences Pn and Qn are said to be mutually contiguous or bi-contiguous (denoted ) if both Qn is contiguous with respect to Pn and Pn is contiguous with respect to Qn. The notion of contiguity is closely related to that of absolute continuity. We say that a measure Q is absolutely continuous with respect to P (denoted ) if for any measurable set A, implies . That is, Q is absolutely continuous with respect to P if the support of Q is a subset of the support of P, except in cases where this is false, including, e.g., a measure that concentrates on an open set, because its support is a closed set and it assigns measure zero to the boundary, and so another measure may concentrate on the boundary and thus have support contained within the support of the first measure, but they will be mutually singular. In summary, this previous sentence's statement of absolute continuity is false. The contiguity property replaces this requirement with an asymptotic one: Qn is contiguous with respect to Pn if the \\"limiting support\\" of Qn is a subset of the limiting support of Pn. By the aforementioned logic, this statement is also false. It is possible however that each of the measures Qn be absolutely continuous with respect to Pn, while the sequence Qn not being contiguous with respect to Pn. The fundamental Radon–Nikodym theorem for absolutely continuous measures states that if Q is absolutely continuous with respect to P, then Q has density with respect to P, denoted as , such that for any measurable set A : Q(A) = \\\\int_A f\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}P, \\\\, which is interpreted as being able to \\"reconstruct\\" the measure Q from knowing the measure P and the derivative ƒ. A similar result exists for contiguous sequences of measures, and is given by the Le Cam's third lemma.

He served as North Carolina's Commissioner of Insurance from 1973 until 1985. Biography =Early life= John Randolph Ingram was born on June 12, 1929 in Greensboro, North Carolina. He attended Asheboro High School. He graduated with a B.S. in Business Administration from the Kenan–Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina in 1951. He earned his Juris Doctor from University of North Carolina School of Law in 1954. =Career= He practiced as an attorney, serving on the board of directors of the North Carolina Bar Association. He served as a lawyer in the JAG Corps. After serving, he returned to North Carolina where he started his political career. He first ran for election to represent Randolph County in the North Carolina House of Representatives in 1960, but lost. He ran for the state House again, winning in 1970, and served for one term, during which he introduced the bill reducing the voting age to 18 in North Carolina, and also advocated for auto insurance reform. He won his post as Commissioner of Insurance in 1972. In that role, he was known as a populist and was an outspoken holder of the office. He won re- election in 1976 and 1980. He considered the abolition of assigned risk for young drivers to be the highlight of his career as Commissioner. Throughout his tenure, he consistently rejected insurance rate increases, although these were overturned by appellate courts in 32 of 33 cases. This brought him into conflict with the General Assembly, which, in 1977, stripped the Commissioner's office of its rate-capping powers. He was indirectly threatened by the Insurance lobby which made many attempts to infiltrate his campaigns and cabinet. This led to the firing of aides and deputies, including successor Jim Long, and holding meetings in parking garages over fears his office was bugged. He ran for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate in 1978, 1986, and 1990. He won the Democratic nomination in the second ballot in the 1978 election against the banker Luther H. Hodges, Jr., who outspent him by $1.7m to only $50,000. In the general election, Ingram lost to the Republican incumbent Jesse Helms. He ran for the position of Governor of North Carolina in 1984, to replace Jim Hunt, whose term ended per constitutional term limits. However, in the primary election, Ingram finished fifth in a crowded field, with 9% of the vote. In 1986, Terry Sanford won the nomination on the first ballot, with Ingram coming second, with 16% of the vote. Ingram came third in the 1990 primary, with 17%, behind Harvey Gantt and Mike Easley. In these later races, Ingram was known to focus primarily to issues of insurance. In the 1990 election, at first, Ingram refused to answer questions about any other topic, focusing on health insurance. However, he was known as pro-choice, and favoured federal funding of abortion for poor victims of rape and incest. =Death= He died on January 6, 2013 from complications of heart disease.

He was respected as an enlightened intellectual and scholar as well. Mainly his fame is due to his poetry. His real name was Syed Sibte Hassan Rizvi. He adopted \\"Khawar\\" as his pen-name for writing poetry and essays. Khawar means in Persian \\"The East\\". Khawar was a great lover and admirer of East, eastern way of life and eastern values. Early life and career Khawar Rizvi belonged to a noble Syed Family. He was born on 1 June 1938. Some sources claim that his actual year of birth was 1936 but the official documents show that he was born in 1938. He inherited poetry from his mother Abida Begum who herself was a poet of high caliber though most of her poetry could not be preserved. His maternal uncle Dr Abul Hassan was a well-known poet and scholar. Bano Saidpuri an eminent poet was his aunt. The father of Khawar Rizvi, Syed Najm ul Hassan Rizvi belonged to Armed forces of Pakistan. He fully supported and encouraged his son to become a great man. Khawar Rizvi was fond of knowledge and learning since his early childhood. He received his formal education at Government School, Campbell Pur now called Attock. He graduated from Government College Attock. Afterwards he post-graduated in Literature from the University of Punjab. He started his career as a teacher then he joined banking sector and became a competent banker. Due to his abhorrence for any sort of exploitation and depriving the poor from their rights he left banking career despite an uncertain future ahead of him. To serve people better, Khawar joined the department of Social Security in Pakistan. He was serving in the same department as a Director when he died of sudden heart attack on 15 November 1981 while journeying from his home town to his work place. His funeral was attended by thousands of people and he was buried in the graveyard of Ahmad Pur Sial, a historical small town in Jhang District, Pakistan. His death at the age of 43 was widely mourned throughout the continent, especially in the region of South Asia. Ideology and activism Khawar Rizvi was not an armchair thinker or a drawing room revolutionary. He actively participated in the political and intellectual movements of his times. He belonged to famous Progressive Writers' Movement in the sub-continent of India and Pakistan. Khawar was against all sorts and types of tyranny, dictatorship, subjugation and exploitation. Due to his ideology and political beliefs he became the victim of General Zia-ul-Haq’s policies, the then dictator ruler of Pakistan. He fought for the freedom of expression, civil liberties, human rights, equality and alleviation of poverty. Tributes and homages The progressive poetry of Khawar Rizvi was ever acknowledged and appreciated during his lifetime and after his death. The renowned writers and poets like Ahmad Nadeem Qasimi, Tanveer Sipra, Professor Yousuf Hassan, Amjad Islam Amjad, Munno Bhai, Hassan Akhter Jalil and others condoled his death. Ahmad Nadeem Qasimi wrote for him in his literary magazine \\"Funnon\\" published from Lahore. Khalid Ahmad wrote a long article about Khawar’s poetry and personality published in \\"daily Jang\\" Karachi. Hassan Rizvi published a piece of article about him in daily \\"Jang\\" Lahore. Azhar Javed wrote about him in his magazine \\"Takhleeq\\". The magazine of Government College Attock \\"Mashal\\" dedicated a special section for Khawar Rizvi and his poetry. Poets like Iqbal Kausar and Dr Saad ullah Kaleem, Professor Zafar Jaunpri, Saeed Jaunpuri and others also wrote the appreciation of Khawar's poetry. The names and works of Khawar Rizvi and his renowned son Dr Syed Shabih-ul-Hassan Rizvi were mentioned in the books of Rashid Amjad, Raghab Shakeeb, Waqar bin Ellahi and in other books and periodicals. A popular, unique and widely circulated magazine Kidzine International paid tribute to Khawar Rizvi in following words: > He was ever respected as a thinker and scholar throughout his life though it > was so short in years but too big in deeds. Khawar Rizvi’s thought was > progressive. He never compromised on any subjugation. Though he was at high > position in Social Security department yet he always defended the rights of > the workers. All his life he loved youth and children. He never liked > disappointment and negative thinking. He was too full of life that death > didn’t dare to enter his home but caught him in the middle of way far from > his home in the morning and mourning hours of 15th November 1981 when he was > only 43.

Because of its crime plot, The Night Rose was subjected to censorship, and was the first film rejected in whole by the recently created New York State Motion Picture Commission which it condemned \\"as highly immoral and of such character that its exhibition would not only tend to corrupt morals, but to incite crime.\\" Goldwyn appealed the decision to New York state court, with upheld the commission's decision on November 18, 1921. Goldwyn then came to an agreement with the state commission to edit the film, which removed many of the Chaney scenes and renamed his character from O'Rourke to Duke McGee.

This point will be engaged because of the properties of the system and the outside influences and parameters. In electronic engineering establishing an operating point is called biasing.  Wanted and unwanted operating points of a system  Operating point of a system consisting of drive (AC motor) and working machine (pump) The operating point of a system is the intersection point of the torque-speed curve of drive and machine. Both devices are linked with a shaft so the speed is always identical. The drive creates the torque which rotates both devices. The machine creates the counter-torque, e.g. by being a moved device which needs permanent energy or a wheel turning against the static friction of the track. * The drive speed increases when the driving torque is higher than the counter-torque. * The drive speed decreases when the counter-torque is higher than the driving torque. At the operating point, the driving torque and the counter-torque are balanced, so the speed does not change anymore. * A speed change in a stable operating point creates a torque change which acts against this change of speed. A change in speed out of this stable operating point is only possible with a new control intervention. This can be changing the load of the machine or the power of the drive which both changes the torque because it is a change in the characteristic curves. The drive-machine system then runs to a new operating point with a different speed and a different balance of torques. Should the drive torque be higher than the counter torque at any time then the system does not have an operating point. The result will be that the speed increases up to the idle speed or even until destruction. Should the counter torque be higher at any times the speed will decrease until the system stops.  Stable and unstable operating points  Unstable operating point of an engine consisting of drive (AC motor) and working machine (pump) Also in case of an unstable operating point the law of the balance of the torques is always valid. But when the operating point is unstable then the characteristics of drive and machine are nearly parallel. In such a case a small change in torque will result in a big change of speed. In practice no device has a characteristics which is so thin that the intersection point can be clearly expected. Because of parallel characteristics, inner and outer friction as well as mechanical imperfections the unstable operating point is rather a band of possible operating states instead of a point. Running at an unstable operating point is therefore undesirable. The middle point on the curve in the third picture on the right is an unstable point, too. However the above-mentioned assumptions are not valid here. Torque and speed are the same but in case the speed will be increased only little then the torque of the drive will be much higher than the counter-torque of the machine. The same but vice versa applies when reducing the speed. For this reason this operating point does not have a stabilizing effect on the speed. The speed will run away to the left or the right side of the point and the drive will run stable there.  Wanted and unwanted operating points  Wanted and unwanted operating points of an engine In the lower right picture the electrical drive (AC motor) moves a conveyor belt. This type of machine has a nearly constant counter-torque over the whole range of speed. By choosing the incorrect drive (incorrect in size and type) there will be three possible operating points with the necessary working torque. Naturally the operating point with the highest speed is needed because only there will be the highest mechanical power (which is proportional to torque times speed). At the other operating points the majority of the electrical power (proportional only to the torque) will be only converted into heat inside the drive. Despite the bad power balance the drive can also overheat this way. In the example shown in picture three the desired right operating point with same torque but higher speed (and therefore higher power) cannot be reached alone after starting the drive. The reason is the technically induced decrease of the drive characteristics in the middle of the curve. The speed will reach this area but not increase further. In case of such machines with constant torques a coupling can be used to prevent stopping during start up, it should be rotation speed dependent. (Of course a motor bigger in size would also do, but this is not as economical). With the coupling the counter torque will only be introduced when the load- less drive has reached a speed outside of the unstable working point. Then the drive can safely speed up. Alternatively a drive with an adequate characteristic can be chosen. In the past shunt-motors have been used for this purpose, nowadays asynchronous AC motors are being used or AC motors in combination with a variable frequency drive. Electronics In an electronic amplifier, an operating point is a combination of current and voltage at \\"no signal\\" conditions; application of a signal to the stage - changes voltage and current in the stage. The operating point in an amplifier is set by the intersection of the load line with the non-linear characteristics of the device. By adjusting the bias on the stage, an operating point can be selected that maximizes the signal output of the stage and minimizes distortion.

Functions The grammatical analysis helps readers further in uncovering the detailed intended meanings of each verse and sentence. Each word of the Quran is tagged with its part-of-speech as well as multiple morphological features. Unlike other annotated Arabic corpora, the grammar framework adopted by the Quranic Corpus is the traditional Arabic grammar of i'rab (). The research project is led by Kais Dukes at the University of Leeds, and is part of the Arabic language computing research group within the School of Computing, supervised by Eric Atwell. The annotated corpus includes:K. Dukes and N. Habash (2011). One-step Statistical Parsing of Hybrid Dependency-Constituency Syntactic Representations. International Conference on Parsing Technologies (IWPT). Dublin, Ireland. * A manually verified part-of-speech tagged Quranic Arabic corpus. * An annotated treebank of Quranic Arabic. * A novel visualization of traditional Arabic grammar through dependency graphs. * Morphological search for the Quran. * A machine-readable morphological lexicon of Quranic words into English. * A part-of-speech concordance for Quranic Arabic organized by lemma. * An online message board for community volunteer annotation. Corpus annotation assigns a part-of-speech tag and morphological features to each word. For example, annotation involves deciding whether a word is a noun or a verb, and if it is inflected for masculine or feminine. The first stage of the project involved automatic part-of-speech tagging by applying Arabic language computing technology to the text. The annotation for each of the 77,430 words in the Quran was then reviewed in stages by two annotators, and improvements are still ongoing to further improve accuracy.

Playing career Tanivula was a secondary school sprinter in Fiji and he attended Natabua High school and he was a soccer star in Fiji playing for the Fiji Under-17 before joining the Auckland Development XV in 1997. Tanivula returned to Fiji in 1998 to play for his home side Nadi in the Farebrother Sullivan Trophy challenge against Suva and that's where Tanivula's talent was spotted by Eddie Jones who signed him up with the ACT Brumbies. He made his debut for Auckland for their National Provincial Championship (NPC) competition in 1999 and in that same year they won the NPC. He had offers from the ACT Brumbies as well as the Auckland Blues to be part of their Super 12 team after having a short stint with the Brumbies in 1999. After playing for the blues in the 2000, He was selected into the New Zealand sevens side he made his debut for the Otago Highlanders in 2001. Tanivula was named player of the NPC in 2003 after his brilliance performance in guiding the Auckland side to another victory as they retained the title. Tanivula headed to Japan in 2005 to represent the Kamaishi Seawaves. A series of injuries to both of his knees ended his playing career in 2006. Coaching career Tanivula coached the Nadi rugby team in the Digicel Cup and in 2008 he created history by winning the Farebrother Sullivan Trophy as well as the Digicel Cup. He also guided the Western Crusaders team which won the Colonial Cup. In early 2009, he guided the Fiji Warriors team to the 2009 Pacific Rugby Cup defeating the Upolu Samoa team in the final. His impressive work pleased the Fiji Rugby Union and they offered him the head coaching job of the Fiji sevens team, a position left vacant after the termination of Waisale Serevi's contract. He coached his first sevens tournament in Wellington where Fiji was bundled out in the quarter finals. the following week in San Diego, Fiji was bundled out in the quarters again. He then coached Fiji to the 2009 Rugby World Cup Sevens where Fiji lost in the quarter finals again and thus losing their world champions status. A few weeks later he turned the table in Hong Kong when Fiji defeated South Africa and claimed a first win in 2 years. He then coached the side to the 2009 World Games where Fiji defeated Portugal to retain their gold medal. Fiji lost at the 2009 London Sevens but won a week later at Murrayfield and finished 2nd in the season under Tanivula's guidance. Tanivula renewed his contract with the FRU for another 3 years hoping to guide Fiji to the 2013 Rugby World Cup Sevens but he was fired in 2011 and replaced by the inept Alifereti Dere who failed to win the Melrose Cup just like his predecessor as the team finished 3rd.

James (February 14, 1914 - April 17, 1993), called Bill or Billy James by contemporaries, was a politician from the U.S. state of Maryland. James was first elected to office as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates representing Harford County in 1946, and after serving two terms was elected to the Maryland Senate in 1954. He would serve in the Senate for a further two decades, from 1963 onwards as President of the Maryland Senate. Following his retirement from the state Senate in 1974, James was appointed State Treasurer, a position he would hold from 1975 through 1987. His daughter, Mary-Dulany James, was a member of the Maryland House of Delegates representing District 34A in Cecil and Harford Counties from 1999 until 2015. Biography William S. James was born the son of E. Roy James and Mary S. James in Aberdeen, Maryland on February 14, 1914. His primary education was diverse; he attended public schools in Cecil and Harford Counties before matriculating at the Tome School, a private coeducational college preparatory school in Port Deposit. He earned his bachelor's degree from the University of Delaware and, in 1937, a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Maryland School of Law, entering the Maryland Bar the same year. James immediately established a law practice in Bel Air, and would continue to practice law there until 1975. He quickly rose to prominence in the legal community, and served as a trial magistrate in Havre de Grace from 1944 to 1946, a position he left when he won election to the Maryland House of Delegates representing Harford County. Following two terms in the House, he was elected in 1954 to represent Harford County in the Maryland Senate. In January of that same year, he married Margaret Higinbothom with whom he would have a son, Robert Roy, and a daughter, Mary-Dulany. In 1963, James was elected by his fellow Senators to serve as President of the Maryland Senate, a position he would hold for more than a decade. This would lead to other prominent positions in state politics. He was the Second Vice-President of the 1967 Constitutional Convention, became Chairman of the Commission to Revise the Annotated Code of Maryland in 1970, and in 1971 became Chairperson of the Maryland Democratic Party. During his long career in the Senate, James was recognized for a number of major legislative accomplishments. He helped establish the community college system in Maryland, the Maryland Environmental Trust, and the Maryland Historical trust, and his work led to the creation of Program Open Space, a program in which real estate taxes are used to purchase parkland. His retirement from the Senate in 1974 did not mark his exit from state politics, as the next year he was appointed by the Senate as State Treasurer, a position to which he would be reelected in 1979 and 1983. Governor William Donald Schaefer, who opposed James' reappointment as State Treasurer, was successful in having the Senate appoint Lucille Maurer in his place. As a result, James retired from politics, and died six years later in April 1993. He was remembered by commentators for his dedication to public service and his civility. His daughter Mary-Dulany James, who also became a lawyer, was elected to represent district 34A in Cecil and Harford Counties in 1999. William S. James Elementary School in Harford County and the William S. James Senate Office Building in Annapolis were named in his honor even before his death.

Pre-war career Dumana was built by Barclay Curle at Whiteinch, Glasgow as the Melma, and launched on 21 November 1921. She was completed by 16 March 1923 and entered service under her new name Dumana for the British India Steam Navigation Company, who registered her in Glasgow. Dumana initially ran between London, Karachi and Bombay, and then in 1934 was transferred to work the route to Calcutta. Second World War The UK Air Ministry chartered Dumana in 1939 for the Mediterranean Air Command to use as a base ship, and she was fitted with workshops to overhaul aircraft. On 5 May 1939, in London, the headquarters of the No. 86 (General Reconnaissance) Wing RAF was reformed aboard Dumana. On 10 May 1939 she sailed from London for Malta carrying Fleet Air Arm units; 19 May 1939 arrived at Grand Harbor, Malta and disembarked FAA units. On 2 June 1939 arrived at Alexandria, Egypt. On 10 October 1939, the headquarters of the No. 86 (General Reconnaissance) Wing RAF disembarked at Aboukir, Egypt.

Being on the path of both infrastructure development and research diversification for more than 80 years, the Institute has eventually originated five more specialized research institutions. Currently, the Institute employs more than 300 researchers (together with two Full Members and eight Corresponding Members of the NASU) and around 200 peoples of supporting personnel. It has more than 20 scientific units (including the state-of-the-art Femtosecond Laser Complex) which are grouped around four research programs Traditionally, the Institute is focused on fundamental research. At the same time, applied research on cryogenics, LC displays, laser systems, pyroelectric detectors, biophysics and plasma technologies strengthen the Institute's activities. The IOP is consistently ranked at the top of national academic institutions ranking. Besides, international reputation of IOP is growing constantly as prominent scientists from the Institute expand their activity to leading foreign research centers and universities. History The origin of the Institute of Physics is dated back to 1921, when the Kyiv Regional Department of Education established the Physics research laboratory. The following year, it was transformed into the Kyiv Science- Research Department of Physics at Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. The separate entity was established in 1929, when the Department was transformed into the Science-Research Institute of Physics of the People's Commissariat of Education of the Ukrainian SSR. It was eventually renamed as the Institute of Physics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. In 2009, the Institute celebrated its 80th anniversary. Academician O.G. Goldman was the founder and the first director of the Institute, which has 20 employees in 1929, including 6 scientists and 10 graduate students. In the first years of existence, the Institute was mainly focused on the training of young scientists and finding its own areas of specialization. Many people who successfully defended their phd theses in that time then became famous scientists. Among them: academicians V.Ye. Lashkaryov, S.I. Pekar and V.P. Linnik, associate members of the Academy of Sciences N.D. Morgulis and P.G. Borzyak, doctors of science M.D. Gabovich, O.G. Miselyuk and others. In 1938, the Institute has 3 major research specializations: Semiconductor physics (heads O.G. Goldman, V.Ye. Lashkaryov since 1939); Physics of electronic and electrovacuum processes (head N.D. Morgulis); X-ray physics of metals (head S.D. Gertsriken) Before the Soviet Union was attacked by Germany in 1941, the Institute employed 122 persons, including 36 scientists and 7 graduate students. The Institute has also experimental workshops with qualified staff and state-of-the-art equipment. Ukrainian physical notes, a journal, was published between 1929 and 1936. During World War II, the Institute was relocated in Ufa. Academician A.I. Leipunskii (he was the director between 1943 and 1949) and professor G.D. Latyshev from Ukrainian Physical-Technical Institute entered its management team. The focus of the research is directed towards military applications. After the war, the Institute was quickly restored. In 1953, new buildings for laboratories, production and housing were brought into service on Nauky avenue near the Golosiyivskyi forest. Some new areas of research activity were developed. Among them: nuclear physics (heads: A.I. Leipunskii and then M.V. Pasichnik), physics of crystals (academician A.F. Prikhot’ko), theoretical physics (academician O.S. Davydov and S.I. Pekar). Electrostatic generator, cyclotron laboratory, and nuclear reactor were put into operation in 1947, 1956, and 1960, correspondingly. Some specialized research institutes originate from the Institute of Physics. In 1945, on the basis of Diffusion Process Department the Laboratory of Metal Physics was organized, which become the Institute of Metallophysics in 1955. On the basis of the Semiconductor Department, the Institute of Semiconductors was established in 1960. Then, the Institute for Theoretical Physics was established in 1966 from the Department of Elementary Particles. In 1970, some departments were transformed into the Institute for Nuclear Research of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. And the Institute of Applied Optics was created on the basis of Optical Quantum Electronics Department. As a result of such organizational transformations, many famous scientists moved to the new Institutions of the Academy of Sciences. But the Institute of Physics also developed significantly and did not lose its leadership. In the 1960s, new areas such quantum electronics, holography, nonlinear optics, pyroelectronics were developed. The Institute made significant contribution to some fields in physics, such as nuclear physics, semiconductor physics, solid state physics, liquid crystals, quantum electronics, plasma physics, and others. Its scientists received certificates for 5 discoveries – more than any other institution in Ukraine. Moreover, scientists of the Institute were awarded the Lenin Prize, 4 State Prizes of the USSR, and 18 State Prizes of Ukraine in physics. In 1979, the Institute was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for its large-scale success in the development of physical science and training the highly qualified personnel. Due to the unique architecture of the main building of the Institute and painting on its dome made by honoured Ukrainian artist M.A. Storozhenko, the main building of the Institute was recognized to have a significant historical value and listed among other monuments of architecture, history, and art.

The properties of excitons and other quasiparticles are also studied, as well as quantum-dimensional structures. Research interests extend to high-temperature superconductivity, magnetic phenomena such as magnetic resonance, magnetostriction, and magnetooptics, as well as optical and magnetic phenomena in semimagnetic semiconductors. Investigations of defects, both radiation and technological, in semiconductors are of high fundamental and practical importance, as well as developments of radiation techniques for machining semiconductor materials for microelectronics. Studies of biological systems, phototransformation in biomolecules, laser photochemistry and spectroscopy of biomolecules. =Nanophysics and nanoelectronics= Such investigations began in the middle of the 1960s, when the Physical Electronics Department started studying discontinuous films and discovered the effect of cold electronic emission from such structures. Now, most of the departments work with nanoscale systems to investigate their optical, magnetic, transport, and photoelectric properties. Research activity is also directed to improving the methods for synthesis of nanoscale objects. =Laser physics, nonlinear and singular optics, and holography= The Institute continues investigating the physics gas lasers, solid-state lasers and dye lasers. Also, scientific interest expand to investigations of nonlinear optical phenomena in semiconductor crystals, molecular crystals and liquid crystals, photorefractive materials, polymers, organic molecules, and photopolymer materials for holography and information recording. Many research projects involve nonlinear laser spectroscopy with ultrahigh resolution, photoacoustic laser spectroscopy and microscopy, or aimed at creating new methods for laser manipulation of free atom particles. There are some traditional research areas, such as dynamic holography, multi-beam optics, speckle fields and holographic correlation methods for laser beam transformation. Also, new investigations in singular optics are conducted. =Surface physics, emission and plasma electronics= Investigations of small particles and their ensembles are conducted. Optical and emission properties of discontinuous films, physical phenomena in adsorbed films, gas and metal adsorption on solid state surfaces, electronic emission, atom structure and phase transitions in two-dimensional systems, characteristics of ordered thin-film molecular systems, solid state plasma phenomena, hot charge carriers and self- organization effects in semiconductors, and phonon transportation in semiconductors are studied. Physics of ion-beam plasma, plasmodynamics and plasma kinetics are studied. Recently, new highly efficient plasma technologies and devices were created on the basis of fundamental investigations. They include high-current plasma lenses, devices for surface cleaning and coating, plasma sterilizers of medical equipment and materials.

Famous scientists Since 1929, the Institute employed many researchers famous for their contribution into both theoretical and applied physics. Especially in Soviet time, they were at the leading edge of scientific development. Now, many former employees of the Institute work for leading research institutions throughout the world. Collaboration with them allows domestic scientists to effectively share ideas with universities and laboratories throughout the world and employ the best facilities for elaborated experiments. * Antonina F. Prikhot'ko, a Hero of Socialist Labor, laureate of the Lenin Prize of the USSR, State Prize of Ukraine, and Honored Scientist of Ukraine. Her pioneering studies of low-temperature crystal spectra resulted in the discovery of excitons, for which she won the Lenin prize. This discovery received international recognition. During 1965–1970 years she was the director of the Institute, and she remain the only women who took the office. Her contribution to the organization development is warmly appreciated even know because she established the most successful research departments and brought up many talented scientist, whose work later became internationally appreciated. * Alexander S. Davydov, a laureate of the State Prize of the USSR. He is famous for predicting Davydov splitting, a phenomenon observed in molecular crystals due to intermolecular interaction when excitons can move from one group of molecules to another. He also developed the theory of absorption, scattering and dispersion of the light in molecular crystals, as well as phenomenological and quantum statistical theory of propagation of light through crystal which take into account spatial dispersion and processes of relaxation.http://www.iaqms.org/DeceasedMembers/IAQMS.member.Davydov.html He is also known for his work as the director of the Institute for Theoretical Physics of the Academy of Sciences between 1973 and 1988. * Alexander I. Leipunskii, one of the pioneers of the nuclear research and nuclear industry in the USSR, a laureate of the Lenin Prize of the USSR, Hero of Socialist Labor, Order of the October Revolution, Order of the Badge of Honor and three Orders of Lenin. In 1933, at the age of 30, he became the director of the Kharkov Physical Technical Institute. In 1934 he studied at the Cavendish Laboratory famous for the fact that 29 Cavendish researchers have won Nobel prizes. -- Nobel Prize Winners who have worked for considerable periods of time at the Cavendish Laboratory Since 1939 he was the chief of a research program investigating the fission of uranium nuclei. Since 1950, he administered the project for creating the Soviet fast neutron reactor. Also, he was the director of the Institute of Physics in 1944-49. * Solomon I. Pekar, a laureate of the State Prize of the Ukrainian SSR, was the first to describe the changes of the exciton energy spectrum due to coupling to light in terms of additional waves appearing in the crystal (1957). In 1946, he created a theory of adiabatic polarons; the term \\"polaron\\" came from him. Emmanuel I. Rashba. Excitons: How we worked on the Volume Alert. Journal of Luminescence, 85, 4, 2000.

The bridge connects the Russky Island and the Muravyov-Amursky Peninsula sections of the city across the Eastern Bosphorus strait, and with a central span of it is the longest cable-stayed bridge in the world. The Russky Bridge was originally built to serve the 2012 Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation conference hosted at the Far Eastern Federal University campus on Russky Island. Медведев открыл движение по мосту на остров Русский It was completed in July 2012 and opened by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, and on September 3, 2012, the bridge was officially given its name. Долгожданные мосты Владивостока получили имена Overview The bridge to Russky Island is the world's longest cable-stayed bridge, with a long central span. The bridge also has the second highest pylons after the Millau Viaduct and the longest cable stays. The design of the bridge crossing has been determined on the basis of two primary factors: *Shortest coast-to-coast distance in the bridge crossing location . Navigable channel depth is up to . *The locality of the bridge crossing construction site is characterized by severe climate conditions: temperatures vary from –31 to +37 °C (–24 to +99 °F); storms bring winds of up to and waves of up to in height; and ice formations in winter can be up to thick. =Pylons construction= Span approach construction, 2009 Pylon construction at the start, September 2009 The piles were driven as deep as below ground and on the island side 120 auger piles were piled under each of the two high bridge towers. The pylons were concreted using custom self-climbing forms in pours of . A crane was used on the first three pours, afterwards the formwork was completed unaided moving through the hydraulic motion of modular elements. The pylons are A-shaped, therefore, the use of standard forms was not feasible. An individual set of forms was arranged for each bridge tower. Transition between section types was carried out at summer levels at the elevations of and . The use of self- climbing forms made it possible to achieve better quality and decrease the time of construction of cast-in-situ reinforced concrete structures by half as much again. The cable stays anchorage zone starts at . The installation of cable stay pairs and casting of bridge tower bodies was carried out simultaneously, dramatically reducing the construction period. =Central span structure= The span structure has an aerodynamic cross-section to assume squally wind loads. The shape of the span cross-section has been determined based on aerodynamic design and optimized according to the results of experimental processing of the scale model in the detailed design phase. Welded field connections are used for longitudinal and transversal joints of the cap sheet of the orthotropic deck and lower ribbed plate. For joints of vertical walls of the blocks, longitudinal ribs, transversal beams and diaphragms, field connections are used provided by means of high-strength bolts. Large-sized prefabricated sections for the installation of the central span were delivered by barges to the erection site and hoisted by a crane to a height. Here, the elements were abutted and cable stays attached to them. =Cable-stayed system= A cable-stayed system assumes all static and dynamic loads on which the very existence of the bridge depends. Cable stays are not designed to endure the entire lifetime of the bridge, but they are repairable and have the best possible protection from natural disasters and other adverse impacts. Parallel strand stay (PSS) cable stays consist of parallel strands of diameter; every strand consists of seven galvanized wires. Cable stays incorporate from 13 to 79 strands. The length of the shortest cable stay is ; the longest, . The protective housings of the cable stays are made from high density polyethylene (HDPE) and have the following features: UV resistance; resistance to local climate conditions of Vladivostok (temperature range from –40 to +40 °C; –40 to +104 °F) and environmental aggressiveness.

Путин. Итоги. 10 лет: независимый экспертный доклад In January 2007, Vladimir Putin, then-President of Russia, stated that holding a summit in Vladivostok is a distinct possibility, and that at least 100 billion rubles would be required to prepare the city for the summit, which, at the time, was three times more than the provincial budget of Primorsky Krai as a whole. , the cost of construction was expected to surpass $1 billion USD, and the project description on the site of the general contractor did not list project costs. Additionally, the built-in capacity of 50,000 cars per day is ten-times the existing population of Russky Island at only 5,000 inhabitants, leading to severe under-usage. There had previously been criticism that the paved road had ended in a dead end, a short distance beyond the bridge, during the first year after it was built. The paved road network has since then been expanded. As of 2018, the road covers the entire Sapper peninsula, about 25% of the total area of the island.http://russianisland.ru/%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2-%D1%80%D1%83%D1%81%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B0.htmlhttps://www.newsvl.ru/vlad/2016/10/27/152956/ References External links *Construction of the bridge to Russky Island: news and photos from start until today * Russian Bridge completed over the Eastern Bosphorus Strait (photo) (Русский мост сомкнулся над проливом Босфор Восточный (фото)) Bridges in Vladivostok Cable-stayed bridges in Russia Cross-sea bridges in Asia Road bridges in Russia Bridges completed in 2012 2012 establishments in Russia Pacific Coast of Russia ","title":"Russky Bridge"},{"id":"25056960","text":"Fish Island is the name given to an area in east London, England in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. It encompasses one of 58 designated conservation areas in Tower Hamlets, with many of its buildings considered important to Britain's industrial heritage, though there are no listed buildings in the area. Regeneration and construction projects in Fish Island from 2016 onwards have caused the area to be referred to as \\"the new Shoreditch\\", in reference to the gentrification of that neighbourhood in the late 1990s. Nearby Hackney Wick has a similar character to Fish Island and this sometimes leads to Fish Island being described as part of Hackney Wick, though they are in different boroughs. Fish Island, despite its name, is not an actual island. Location The area of Fish Island runs along the river Lea and borders the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park to the east. It is separated from Bow to the west by the A12 and its southern border is the intersection of the A12, the river Lea and the train tracks to and from Stratford. According to the council's Fish Island Area Action plan, the area extends north past the Hertford Union Canal to border with the London Borough of Hackney along the Hackney Wick railway station. The area of the Olympic park belonging to Tower Hamlets is also considered as part of Fish Island by the council, making it the north- easternmost part of the borough. History =Early history= Although it is thought the area has had human settlements since pre-historic times, evidence of human activity prior to the Roman period is sparse. Evidence from the Roman period, however, is abundant. The exact nature of the Roman settlements is undetermined, though there is evidence that the area was occupied until the end of the 4th or 5th century and, according to the London and Middlesex Archaeological Society (LAMAS) \\"it produced large quantities of Roman pottery, coins, burials, ditches, pits and animal bones, particularly of cattle\\". Pye Road, the main Roman road linking London to Colchester, passed through the area and would likely have crossed the river Lea at what is now Fish Island, though the nature or exact location of the crossing point is not fully understood. Immediately after the Roman period, little is known of what became of the local settlements. In the Domesday Book of 1086, the wider area is known Old Ford and is listed as part of the Manor of Stepney and remained as such until at least the early 1300s. At some point the Roman road and crossing will have fallen into disrepair, though the area remained the main crossing point between London and Essex until the early 12th century, at which point a stone bridge was constructed approximately half a mile downstream. There are few historical references of the area from the medieval and post- medieval periods. The first known map of the area, from 1665, shows what is now Fish Island as an undeveloped marshland only sparsely populated. =Industrialisation= In the late 18th and early 19th century, the Hackney Cut and the Hertford Union Canal were cut into the local marshes and a series of railway lines were established through the area which precipitated the shift from rural to industrial. Toxic processing plants for commodities such as crude oil and coal tar were set up along the Hertford Union Canal. These factories were soon followed by others using these materials to produce things like printing ink, rubber and dry cleaning. The waterways were a vital part of this industry, allowing for raw materials and finished products to be moved to and from the docks. It was at one point London's largest waterside industrial area. In 1865, a 30-acre plot of surplus railway land in the area was purchased by the Imperial Gas Light & Co. in order to establish a new gasworks. However, a decision was made to set up the new works in a different location and so the land was sold on to the Gas Light and Coke Company (separate company). They instead used the land to build a factory town comprising a series of small houses and multi-storey factories and a network of new roads. These roads were given the names of fresh water fish (Dace, Bream, Roach) and, as the local area had been known to residents as \\"the Island\\", it eventually became known as Fish Island. By the end of the 19th century, Fish Island had become an area of intense and diverse industrial activity, often dangerous or noxious in nature. At this time the area had a population of approximately 6,000 inhabitants, mostly consisting of local workers and their families and although local living conditions were improving towards the beginning of the 20th century, most residents of Fish Island lived in poverty and squalor in makeshift accommodation. During World War II, Fish Island suffered extensive bomb damage with many of the buildings either completely destroyed or seriously damaged. =Post-war and recent regeneration= Fish tail sculptures at the junction of Monier Road and Wansbeck Road Following the war, the area changed greatly as local industries shifted to \\"low employment uses\\", such as waste disposal, timber yards and warehouses, and much of the population left the area. Houses and local amenities were cleared and converted to industrial use. As a result, by the 1970s, the area became almost exclusively light industrial in nature and was virtually devoid of other uses, with many waste disposal sites and warehouses. During the 1990s, the area saw an expansion of new creative industries and an influx of artists, who converted old and dilapidated warehouses into studios or lofts. It is claimed that the area had the highest density of artists in Europe in the 1990s and Fish Island, together with neighbouring Hackney Wick, became better known for its local art scene than its industry. In the early 2000s, Fish Island received new attention given its proximity to the site of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, the venue for the London 2012 Olympics. Local councils identified Fish Island, together with Hackney Wick, as key areas for regeneration as part of the development for the Olympic Games. As a result, the area saw the construction of a number of large residential and mixed use buildings, with more planned for completion in later years. This regeneration of the area and the associated increase in living cost and property prices led many to draw parallels with the gentrification of Shoreditch in the late 1990s, with the Daily Telegraph calling Fish Island \\"the new Shoreditch\\" in 2016.  Governance  Fish Island falls within the parliamentary constituency of Bethnal Green and Bow within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. The electoral ward it falls within is the Bow East ward. Culture Street art on rear of Fish Island buildings as seen from Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park Fish Island has a long tradition as a home to artists and art spaces. In 2009 the Island, and adjoining Hackney Wick, was found to have \\"one of the highest densities of fine artists, designers and artisans in Europe\\", with around 600 artists' studios in the area. The London Centre for Book Arts has been based in the Britannia Works building, part of Space Studios, since 2012. The centre promotes book arts and artist-led publishing, with printing, binding and publishing facilities.https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jan/01/new-chapter- centre-book- artshttps://www.ft.com/content/bc7fcfd6-96cf-11e2-a77c-00144feabdc0https://londonbookarts.org/about/ In 2014, a partnership between tech hub The Trampery and the Barbican Centre, led to the establishment of Fish Island Labs, a mentored art and technology project, which allowed 40 to 50 participants to share a low-cost workspace for ten months.

These religious missions were created in 1609 and developed for 150 years. Both Jesuit missions were declared World Heritage Site by the UNESCO in 1993. The Jesuit missions of Paraguay are considered some of the most impressive creations of the religious work of the Jesuits and are testimony of the historical richness of the country. History Main altar of Jesús de Tavarangue.Aleixo Garcia encountered Paraguay in 1524. Its development in the political, economical and social matter was a slow process, scarred by armed conflicts between Spanish conquerors and natives, who fought to preserve their territory. By 1590 the Spanish had founded 10 cities and 40 colonies in South America. The natives were forced to be at their service (Encomienda system). The Spanish King tried to improve their quality of life by making some decrees for their protection but it was difficult to have a real system of control to make sure they were obeyed. The system of \\"Encomienda\\" gave place to many insurrections of the natives. It was not until the Missions were established that there was a real improvement in the living conditions of the natives. The first Jesuits arrived in Tucumán in 1586 and in 1587, by request of the Asunción's Bishop, Alonso Guerra. The Jesuits started the evangelization and building of towns or Missions in the region of Misiones and Itapúa Departments in Paraguay. The first thing they did was to form towns that were self- sufficient in the areas inhabited by the natives and a study of the Guaraní language they spoke to make a writing structure (because the Guaraní people did not write their language). The missioners not only imparted knowledge about religion but also determined the rules of public order, culture, education, and society, which had great influence in the later development of Paraguay. The natives, who were nomads and were not used to a structured life, founded themselves gathered in small communities in the forest. Near the Jesuit Missions were formed groups of 2000 or 3000 per town. This group of missioners founded about 30 Missions in territories that nowadays belong to Paraguay, Brazil, Argentina, and Bolivia. Many of the constructions have been preserved and the ones that had been damaged were rebuilt. Santísima Trinidad del Paraná Ruins The Santísima Trinidad del Paraná Mission is considered the biggest of all the missions. Natives that came from the missions of San Carlos (nowadays in the territory of Argentina) were its founders in 1712. This mission has the biggest built temple among all the Jesuit Missions, with an altar carved from a single piece of stone. In it is represented the persecution of the natives at that time. It has a Central Square, the town's place of meeting, and a museum, located in the old sacristy, are the sculptures and a scale model of the mission. These ruins are being restored and maintained constantly. It is a Cultural Patrimony of Humankind. Jesús de Tavarangue Ruins Access to the temple. The church of Reducción de Jesús (Jesus’ Mission) was in the process of being built at the time that the Jesuits were expelled from Río de la Plata Province. It would have been one of the biggest churches of that time, with a central structure of 70 meters long and 24 meters wide. It would have been a replica of the Sanctuary of Loyola, in Spain. The three front access doors are very impressive. UNESCO declared it Cultural Patrimony of Humankind in 1993. It is considered one of the most important edifications of the 30 Jesuits towns in the region. The stone pulpit, the friezes of angels, the rose-shaped carved stone in the lintels in the doors, and the bell tower stand out in its architecture. The ruins of these missions show a way of life and education marked by its singular style. How to get to the ruins The ruins in Paraguay are, possibly, the best preserved, and include Jesús, San Cosme, Damián and Trinidad Missions. To get to these places it is necessary to take Route No. 6 from Encarnación. The entries to all the missions are signaled on the route. The access to the ruins of Trinidad is located 700 meters from Route No. 6 in “km 31”, about 1 kilometer after, is the access to the ruins of Jesús de Tavarangue. The site of the ruins of Jesús is 12 km from this access point and can be easily reached by taxi or bus. References * La Magia de nuestra tierra. Fundación en Alianza.

Haguy's career as of summer 2019 has spanned 19 seasons, including professional contracts at Ligue 2 clubs Laval and Nîmes. Club career Born in Paris, Haguy was noticed by the staff of Ligue 2 side Lorient whilst playing for Championnat de France Amateur side Levallois. He subsequently signed an amateur contract with the club in the summer of 2002, hoping to make a breakthrough into the professional ranks. He made his Ligue 2 debut as a substitute in the 1–1 draw at AS Saint-Étienne on 4 September 2002. During his time at the club he also made a substitute appearance in the 2002–03 UEFA Cup, against Denizlispor in the first round, second leg. After leaving Lorient at the end of the 2002–03 season, Haguy played the next five seasons for Championnat National clubs Romorantin, Cherbourg and Vannes. With Vannes he won the league and promotion to Ligue 2, but he was unexpectedly released by the club in the summer of 2008. He subsequently signed for Laval on a one-year deal, with the option of a professional deal if the club won promotion back to Ligue 2. Laval won promotion at the end of the 2008–09 season, and Haguy made his professional debut in the first game of the 2009–10 Ligue 2 season on 7 August 2009, against Brest. He scored his first professional goal in the 1–0 away win at SC Bastia on 28 August 2009. Released at the end of his Laval contract, Haguy signed for Nîmes Olympique, after a trial, on 9 July 2010. He stayed two-and- a-half seasons with the club, suffering relegation from Ligue 2 and then winning the Championnat National the following season. In January 2013 he signed for Le Poiré-sur-Vie in the Championnat National. At the end of the season, after a trial at Auxerre, he signed for a second time for Cherbourg, this time in Championnat de France Amateur. A season there was followed by a season with Jura Sud in 2014–15 at the same level, before Haguy returned the Championnat National with Belfort. After a season-and-a-half with Belfort, Haguy left for CS Sedan Ardennes, who offered him a six month contract with an option for a further year if the team remained in the Championnat National. Sedan were relegated and Haguy was released. In August 2017 he signed for Épinal in Championnat National 2. International career Haguy made his international debut for Guadeloupe on 1 June 2016, in a qualifying game for the 2017 Caribbean Cup against Martinique.

It has been suggested that populations in the southwestern United States may be a separate species. No maps of barrens dagger moth distribution were available as of 2008. Barrens dagger moths generally occur in oak (Quercus spp.) or pine (Pinus spp.) barren communities. They are associated with pitch pine-bear oak (P. rigida-Q. ilicifolia) forest and oak scrub communities in New England and southeastern New York. On Martha's Vineyard, they may be associated with frost-bottom communities (Goldstein 1994, cited in ). They have been observed in black oak-post oak (Q. velutina-Q. stellata) woodland in New Jersey and occur in an area of the Atlantic City International Airport that has been mowed every 1 to 2 years since the 1940s. Barrens dagger moths occupy oak savannahs and oak-hickory (Carya spp.) forests in the western and southern portions of their range Life history Barrens dagger moths are nocturnal and are typically just over an inch (3.0–3.5 cm) long. The period in which adults emerge from cocoons extends over 2 months. Adult barrens dagger moths are typically active from June to August but have been documented from late May to September in New Jersey and Missouri . Dagger moth species that occupy pine barrens can be found 1 to 2 miles (2–3 km) from suitable habitat, suggesting considerable dispersal potential . Adults generally produce one brood. However, in New Jersey and Missouri, eggs laid in mid-June may result in a partial second brood . Eggs are laid in July or August and typically take about 6 days to hatch. Larvae are present for 4 to 5 weeks in late June to September or October. If second-brood larvae occur, it may take 8 to 10 weeks for these individuals to begin pupation . Pupae are present in fall, winter, and spring. Barrens dagger moth may pupate in a flimsy cocoon in soil, although the precise location(s) of pupae is uncertain . Pupae do not seem to overwinter more than once . Preferred habitat Barrens dagger moth habitat is often described as sandy, xeric, and open oak-dominated communities. Rare moths that occur in pitch pine-bear oak communities, including barrens dagger moth, were associated with early successional habitat patches in southeastern Massachusetts. Barrens dagger moths have not been documented in most potential habitat, despite being relatively easy to detect (see Sampling) . More detailed studies on barrens dagger moth habitat requirements are needed. Landscape-scale characteristics may have greater influence on barren dagger moth habitat quality than patch- or plot-level characteristics. Patches of remnant habitat occupied by barrens dagger moths are typically larger than 2,000 acres (1,000 ha). In models based on surveys of rare moths in a pitch pine-bear oak community in southeastern Massachusetts, barrens dagger moth was positively associated with landscapes with a high percentage of open-canopy oak scrub and negatively associated (P=0.03) with mixed hardwood-conifer forest without pitch pine at the 1,120-acre (450 ha) scale. At a smaller scale (17 acres (7 ha)), barrens dagger moth was negatively associated (P=0.02) with the dispersion and interspersion of cover types. Connectivity of habitat did not appear important in this study area, but connectivity was generally low. Food habits Bear oak, and possibly other oaks, are the host plants for barrens dagger moth larvae. According to a fact sheet published by the New York Natural Heritage Program, larvae feed on bur oak (Q. macrocarpa), post oak, chestnut oak (Q. prinus), and probably black oak, and adults likely eat honeydew from sucking insects and tree sap. According to the NatureServe review, larvae have been observed on post oak and dwarf chinkapin oak (Q. prinoides). Barrens dagger moths were successfully raised on black oak in captivity, but they rejected blackjack oak (Q. marilandica). Bur oak is the only oak within the Manitoba range of barrens dagger moth . Threats Threats to the persistence of barrens dagger moths include habitat loss, fire suppression, extensive fires, high levels of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) browsing, introduced species, insecticides, off-road vehicles, and light pollution. Introduced species that may negatively impact barrens dagger moth are gypsy moths (Lymantria dispar) and parasitoids such as compsilura (Compsilura concinnata). Spraying for mosquitoes (Culicidae) and gypsy moths could negatively impact barrens dagger moth. Since it is not as persistent as other insecticides, use of the insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki in spring is recommended if severe defoliation by gypsy moths appears imminent. White-tailed deer damage may have contributed to the extirpation of the barrens dagger moth population at Pinery Provincial Park, Ontario. References External links \\"Acronicta albarufa\\".

He resolved to become a professional dancer at the age of six, when he was taught to perform a simple folk dance, a Ukrainian trepak, and discovered the joy of performing. He began taking dancing lessons when he was seven and, under the tutelage of Kathleen O'Brien and Jean Horne, was an experienced amateur by age fifteen. Inspired by performances of Russian ballet troupes that he saw in Australia, he had already begun to develop the exuberant, energetic, and highly theatrical style that would become his trademark in later life. As a result, he won a scholarship from the Royal Academy of Dance to study in England. But, because of the outbreak of war in Europe, he was forced to remain in New Zealand. He studied at Wellington College from 1939 to 1941 and thereafter performed as a song-and-dance man entertaining troops in the PacificDebra Craine and Judith Mackkrill, \\"Grant, Alexander,\\" in The Oxford Dictionary of Dance (Oxford University Press, 2000). while continuing his dance training during the wartime years. In 1946, after peace had come to England, Grant was able to go to London and enroll in the Sadler's Wells Ballet School. He arrived in February, when he was twenty-one years old. His time as a student there was brief, however, for he was soon invited to become a founding member of the Sadler's Wells Theatre Ballet, a sister company to the Sadler's Wells Ballet, which had relocated to the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden. Performing career In September 1946, during his first tour with the young company, Grant was transferred to the main company in Covent Garden, today's Royal Ballet.Judith Cruikshank, \\"Alexander Grant,\\" obituary, The Guardian (London), 4 October 2011. Because of the shortage of male dancers during the war years, he was swiftly promoted to soloist and assigned featured roles in the Sadler's Wells repertory. Frederick Ashton, chief choreographer of the company, noticed him right away and cast him as a music hall hoofer in the Popular Song duet in Façade. Then, in 1947, guest choreographer Léonide Massine chose him for the leading role of the Barber in a revival of his comic ballet Mam'zelle Angot, a lighthearted romp of amorous pursuits. It proved to be the role that made him a star. As a \\"whimsical, endearing little person in a tow-colored wig,\\" Grant happily \\"bounced about the stage like a rubber ball,\\" then collapsed in abject despair before winning the heart of the ballerina in the title role, danced by Margot Fonteyn.Mary Clarke, The Sadler's We;;s Ballet: A History and an Appreciation (London: A.&C.; Black, 1955), p. 222. The next year, 1948, Ashton devised a spectacular hoop dance for him in Les Sirènes, the first of Grant's many created roles in Ashton ballets. Promoted to principal dancer in 1950, Grant became one of Ashton's muses, inspiring him and even collaborating with him in the creation of memorable demi-caractère roles.Geraldine Morris, \\"Dance Partnerships: Ashton and His Dancers,\\" Dance Research (London), 19.1 (Summer 2001), pp. 11-59. During his thirty years as a dancer with the Royal Ballet, 1946–1976, he appeared in some thirty Ashton ballets, originating roles at more than twenty premieres.Nadine Meisner, \\"Alexander Grant: Ballet Dancer Who Reveled in His Long Association with Frederick Ashton,\\" obituary, The Independent (London), 10 February 2011. It was \\"Grant's distinction as a classical dancer, combined with his mastery of character, that enabled Ashton to develop what were usually subsidiary supporting roles—the bravura trick soloists—into key players in the main drama, often introducing a provocative sexual charge.\\"Anonymous, \\"Alexander Grant,\\" obituary, The Telegraph, 4 October 2011. Notable roles with an erotic element were Bryaxis the pirate chief in Daphnis and Chloe (1951), Eros in Sylvia (1952), and Tirrenio the sea god in Ondine (1958). Of all his roles, the two most famous are undoubtedly the sweet simpleton Alain in La Fille Mal Gardée (1960) and Bottom the Weaver in The Dream (1964).Kisselgoff, \\"Alexander Grant,\\" obituary, 3 October 2011). In the former, he leapt and twirled in a delirium of joy with his red umbrella; in the latter, transformed into an ass, he capered about in pointe shoes, simulating hooves, in an interlude with the lovestruck Titania, played by Antoinette Sibley. His performance was described as \\"a cameo of great pathos as well as comedy.\\".Anonymous, \\"Alexander Grant,\\" obituary, The Telegraph, 4 October 2011. Besides being temperamentally unsuited, Grant was too short to dance princes and aristocrats in fairy-tale ballets in the classic repertory. He did, however, possess a decent classical technique, and he was sometimes thrust into the challenge of clean-lined classicism in such Ashton ballets as Symphonic Variations, Les Patineurs, and Scènes de Ballet. But character roles were his forte. He gave more than fifty performances in the title role of Michel Fokine's Petrushka, and he was acclaimed as the eccentric Doctor Coppélius and the mysterious Herr Drosselmeyer in Coppėlia and Casse Noisette, respectively. He also scored success as the Rake in The Rake's Progress and as Satan in Job, both created by Ninette de Valois, and as the Spanish Miller in The Three-Cornered Hat by Massine. Cast in the role originated by Massine, he always won applause for his performance of the smolderingly intense farruca, a solo form of flamenco. In A Month in the Country (1976), based on Ivan Turgenev's comedy of manners, he offered a moving image of a lovelorn Russian husband, opposite Lynn Seymour as the heroine. It was his final Ashton role. Roles created =In Ashton ballets= During the years they worked together, Ashton made numerous roles for Grant.

Later life In 1971, when age and physical disability began to limit the frequency of his performances, Grant became director of Ballet for All, the educational group within the Royal Ballet. He retired from the company in 1976 and accepted the post of artistic director of the National Ballet of Canada, based in Toronto. During his seven years there, he significantly enlarged the company repertory by acquiring works by Ashton, Cranko, MacMillan, Béjart, and other internationally known artists as well as by encouraging such young Canadian choreographers as James Kudelka, He also occasionally appeared on stage as Alain, Carabosse, and various characters in mime roles.Newman, \\"Grant, Alexander\\", in International Encyclopedia of Dance (1998), vol. 3, p. 237. Upon his return to England in 1983, Grant became an extremely popular guest performer and producer. He joined London Festival Ballet (now English National Ballet) as coach and performer, appearing in mostly mime roles such as Doctor Coppélius, Herr Drosselmeyer, and Madge the Witch in La Sylphide. At the \\"Gala Tribute to Sir Frederick Ashton in Celebration of His 80th Birthday\\", held on 18 October 1984 at the Royal Opera House, Grant honored his mentor and friend by dancing a role originated by Ashton in 1931, that of the oily Dago in the Tango-Pasodoble of Ashton's perennially popular Façade.Anonymous, \\"Alexander Grant\\", obituary, The Telegraph, 4 October 2011. He was fifty-nine years old at the time. When Ashton died in 1988, he left the rights to Façade and La Fille Mal Gardée to Grant, who subsequently traveled widely, staging and coaching these ballets for various companies. Awards and honours Grant was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1965 Queen's Birthday Honours. He also received an Icon Award from the Arts Foundation of New Zealand, in recognition of outstanding achievements in the arts, and the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Award, the highest honour given by the Royal Academy of Dance, awarded annually in recognition of outstanding service to the art of ballet. Personal life Offstage, Grant was one of the most beloved members of the Royal Ballet. With his twinkling eyes, gregarious nature, and direct, often humorous turn of phrase, he won many friends and admirers.Meisner, \\"Alexander Grant,\\" obituary, The Independent, 10 February 2011. As a young man, his magnetic personality, thick mane of hair, and craggy good looks caused him to be an object of lust by both sexes. He was romantically attached to ballerina Nadia Nerina in his early years in London but abandoned her in 1953 in favor of an intense affair with Ashton, who had fallen deeply in love with him. When their romance cooled, Ashton and Grant became fast and lifelong friends as well as professional colleagues.Julie Kavanagh, Secret Muses: The Life of Frederick Ashton (New York: Pantheon, 1996), p. 377-375. In the autumn of 1984, Grant was the only personal friend of Ashton's to be invited to a dinner party hosted by Princess Margaret in honor of Ashton's recent birthday. When Ashton died in 1988, he left \\"all royalties and profits from my copyrights\\" to a small group of friends. Those to Façade and La Fille Mal Gardée were bequeathed to Grant.Brendan McCarthy, \\"Frederick Ashton Foundation and Christopher Nourse,\\" Dance Tabs website, 4 February 2012, http://dancetabs.com/2012/02. Retrieved 18 February 2015. In old age, Grant underwent a hip replacement and prostate surgery. His second hip replacement should have been a routine procedure and recovery, but it turned into a pain-racked, seven-month stay in hospital. He died in 2011, at age eighty-six. He was survived by his partner, Jean-Pierre Gasquet, his companion of fifty-four years, and his brother Garry, fifteen years his junior. Also a dancer with the Royal Ballet, Garry Grant inherited many of his older brother's most famous roles.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The flats were built in 1888–89 for the 1st Duke of Westminster. Their building was supervised by the Duke's nephew and agent, Cecil Parker, and named after him. They were intended for the Duke's employees when they retired from working for him on his Eaton Hall estate. They were designed by the Chester firm of architects Douglas & Fordham and based on flats being built for the working-class in London. To this end Douglas was sent to study the Stalbridge Buildings in London which were being developed by the Improved Industrial Dwellings Company. Douglas' relationship with Parker was never harmonious, and when the block of flats was completed, Parker complained about \\"poor materials and workmanship\\". The building still stands and continues to be used as flats, having been refurbished in 1982 by S. J. Lomas for the Northern Counties Housing Association. Douglas' biographer, Edward Hubbard, states that this design is a \\"rare departure from his usual building types\\". Architecture The building is constructed in common brick, with dressings in red Ruabon brick, and diapering in blue brick. It comprises 30 flats in three storeys. The south side of the building, facing Foregate Street, has three asymmetrical bays. The middle bay contains an open basket arch in each storey. On the ground floor the arch forms an entrance porch; on the upper floors the arches form balconies with wrought iron railings. At the top is a gable with three ball finials. Over the entrance arch is a stone panel inscribed with the date 1889 and \\"Parker's Buildings\\". On each floor is a three-light window in the left bay, and a one-light window at a lower level in the right bay. The flats stretch behind this front, with five flats to each storey on each side. Around the building, between the ground and first floor is a string course, and between the upper storeys is a corbel table. Tall brick chimneys rose from the roof. The stairways on the sides are exposed to the exterior, but are contained within the building. Parker's Buildings is set back from the street. The approach is flanked by two three-storey buildings designed by Douglas and Fordham. Each includes a shop at ground level and above this the buildings are in red brick with blue diapering, stone dressings and shaped gables. Both buildings are listed Grade II.

It has been held every year on Thanksgiving Day since 1908.Run for the Diamonds 9 Mile. Association of Road Racing Statisticians (2011-11-28). Retrieved 2011-12-18. The first race had only 13 participants. The course has remained essentially unchanged since 1908, running up a very challenging hill and through the countryside of Summerhill. No women competed officially until 1972 when two women ran. The one hundredth running of the annual event was held in 2009. It was canceled twice due to World War I in 1918 and 1919, but despite World War II & the COVID-19 pandemic, the race went on. The race was called the \\"Berwick Marathon\\" until the 1970s and 1980s. But since the race is too short to qualify as a marathon, and winners receive diamonds as part of their prize, the name was changed to \\"Run for the Diamonds\\". The number of participants has grown dramatically, from about 100 runners in 1973 to 1,985 runners in 2009. The course record of was set in 1980 by Pete Pfitzinger. Course The race starts on Market Street in Berwick and goes north along that street for about a mile before turning onto Summerhill Road, which becomes Foundryville Road as it goes through the municipality of Foundryville. After passing through Foundryville around mile 2, it goes up a very long and steep hill known as \\"The Hill\\". After cresting the hill around mile 3.5, it heads mostly downhill to the halfway point where it turns onto Kachinka Hollow Road and continues descending to Martzville Road at mile 7. The course follows Martzville Road back to Market Street, and then after a mile on Market Street. However, from 1946 to 1954, the race finished at Crispin Field in Berwick.

History Creek 4330 SE integrated amplifier. Creek Audio production was started in 1982 by Michael Creek. Initially, Creek manufactured integrated amplifiers and tuners from its London base. Sales of Creek products increased at a large rate, until new premises were required. Many overseas markets were established together with about 80 specialised UK retail customers but delivery times became extended as sales outstripped production. Additional funding was required to grow the company so in 1988 Creek Audio was sold to Mordaunt-Short who had been bought by the TGI PLC group the previous year. Creek Audio continued to grow but in 1991 Mordaunt-Short's management changed. TGI appointed a new M.D. who jointly managed Tannoy in Scotland and Mordaunt-Short, Creek Audio and Epos Speakers. Production was split between the two companies, which created higher manufacturing costs and led to the company being offered for sale, as it ceased to be profitable. In 1993 a consortium of Creek's overseas distributors from USA, Switzerland and Germany got together with the founder, Mike Creek, to buy the brand name back from TGI PLC.

South 24 Parganas district is divided into two distinct physiographic zones: the marine-riverine delta in the north and the marine delta zone in the south. As the sea receded southwards, in the sub-recent geological period, a large low-lying plain got exposed. Both tidal inflows and the rivers have been depositing sediments in this plain. The periodical collapse of both the natural levees and man-made embankments speed up the process of filling up of the depressions containing brackish water wetlands. The marine delta in the south is formed of interlacing tidal channels. As non- saline water for irrigation is scarce, agriculture is monsoon dominated. Some parts of the wetlands are still preserved for raising fish. Mathurapur I CD block has an area of 147.3 km2. It has 1 panchayat samity, 10 gram panchayats, 112 gram sansads (village councils), 99 mouzas and 95 inhabited villages, as per the District Statistical Handbook, South Twenty-four Parganas.

Champlain said of him in his writings \\"[He is] the most impudent liar that has been seen for a long time\\". In 1611, Vignau volunteered to live with a group of Algonquin natives to learn their language and customs. He accompanied them on their journey North to Allumette Island becoming the second white man to travel up the Ottawa River. Vignau spent the winter on Allumette island with a band of Algonquins led by a one-eyed chief named Tessouat. Anyone coming down the river was forced, by rapids on either side of the island, to portage through Tessouat's territory. Thus his band could easily make a living as toll keepers and fur brokers, buying and selling furs for profit. In the spring of 1612, Vignau paddled down to Montreal and caught the next sailing ship to France. Once there he claimed to have discovered the Northwest Passage. Vignau swore that at the sources of the Ottawa River, he had found a great lake. After crossing it he discovered a river flowing northward. This river led to the shores of the sea. There he had seen the wreck of an English ship whose crew of eighty men had escaped to land and been killed by the Natives. Plus this sea was only seventeen days from Montreal by canoe. It seemed too good to be true. Vignau was asked by Champlain to sign a formal statement of his discovery before two notaries and agreed to accompany Champlain up the Ottawa river the next spring to investigate the veracity of these claims. In 1613, they reached Allumette island where Champlain asked Tessouat if he would provide a guide to escort them to the source of the river. When Tessouat explained the danger posed by the Sorcerers and violent tribes further north, Champlain explained that Vignau had already gone through their land. Tessouat knew this to be false and denounced Vignau as a liar and braggart. Under pressure Vignau confessed. Though Nicolas de Vignau did not discover the Northwest Passage, he may have spoken to some natives that had been as far north as Hudson Bay. The tale of the wrecked British ship may have some basis in fact. Henry Hudson had sailed into Hudson Bay in 1611 and his ship was set adrift by his mutinous crew there.

Biography  Gerhard Palitzsch as a SS Hauptscharfuhrer At the beginning of his career as NCO, Palitzsch served as a sentry in the concentration camps of Lichtenburg, Buchenwald, and Sachsenhausen, where he was Blockführer (head of a prisoners’ barrack). From Sachsenhausen he was transferred to Auschwitz in 1940.People in Auschwitz, by Hermann Langbein. Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press; illustrated edition (December 4, 2003) Language: English. , He brought with him 30 prisoners from Sachsenhausen who were to take over posts as Funktionshäftlinge (prisoners with special functions). Palitzsch was the first Rapportführer and in this position he practised extensive terror. Moreover, he very often took part in the executions at the black wall. Palitzsch claimed to a fellow SS member, that he was responsible for shooting some 25,000 people in the back of the head. Like other concentration camp personnel he enriched himself by stealing the property robbed from the victims and because of this he was a subject of SS investigations into theft and corruption. His transfer in 1943 to a sub- camp at Brünn, Czech Republic, where he was made the Commandant, may have been a penal transfer. Some prisoners in more trusted jobs in Auschwitz fought back against the camp, one of the means of attack was to breed lice infected with typhus in the camp infirmary and then put these lice into clothes given to SS personnel. Because of his notoriety, Palitzsch was given such an item. He did not contract typhus, but his wife Luise died from it. After that, he was believed to have started sexual relations with a female prisoner.Fighting Auschwitz by Josef Garlinski, publisher Fontana, Shortly after his transfer to Brünn he was arrested, sent back to Auschwitz, and interred in the prison in Block 11. Accused of “Race Defilement”, i.e. sexual relations with \\"non- Aryans\\" and theft, Palitzsch was sentenced to death, but reprieved and instead sent to a penal unit. In June 1944, he was thrown out of the SS. His later fate is unknown; he is said to have fallen during the battle of Budapest. In a letter from the resistance movement, smuggled out of Auschwitz, he was described as “the greatest bastard of Auschwitz”. His colleague, Perry Broad, wrote about him in his report that “he enjoyed taking part in the mass executions”. Rudolf Höss, who was not hesitant in his criticism of his staff, wrote in his memoirs: “Palitzsch was the most cunning and sly creature I ever got to know during my long, many-sided duty in the various concentration camps. He literally climbed over dead bodies in order to satisfy his lust for power.”page 409 of People in Auschwitz, by Hermann Langbein.

In 1894, the club had more than three hundred members, while in 1984 this had risen to between eight and nine hundred. History The club's library has been described as one of the finest of its kind in Europe; it has a collection of around three thousand works on the subject of fishing, including works such as the successful Floating Flies and How to Dress Them and Dry Fly Fishing in Theory and Practice by F.M. Halford, one of the club's co-founders. Many well-known anglers are club members, and have contributed signed copies of their publications to the library. According to Basil Field, the founding president, the original prospectus described the club's purposes as follows: :\\"To bring together gentlemen devoted to fly- fishing generally. :\\"To afford a ready means of communication between those interested in this delightful art. :\\"To provide in the reading-room, in addition to all the usual newspapers, periodicals, &c.;, catalogues, and books, foreign as well as English, having reference to fishing, particularly to fly-fishing so as to render the club a means of obtaining knowledge about new fishing places and vacancies for rods, and making it a general medium of information on all points relating to the art.\\" The club publishes a long- standing magazine, the Flyfishers' Journal; writers included G. E. M. Skues, who has been described as \\"one of the greatest trout fishermen that ever lived.\\" Skues dedicated his 1921 book, The Way of a Trout with the Fly to The Flyfishers' Club \\"in gratitude for many happy hours and some priceless friends\\". In 1938, a debate was held at the club on Skues's controversial theories about the use of nymphs in fly-fishing, which led him to publish Nymph Fishing for Chalk Stream Trout. The club also has a museum of fishing memorabilia which holds a rod used by David Garrick and a case of flies reputed to have belonged to Izaak Walton. Other items include a rod box originally exhibited in The Great Exhibition at The Crystal Palace in 1851 and a pirn (used as an alternative to a fishing reel) which belonged to the \\"Ettrick Sheppherd\\" James Hogg. Premises The Flyfishers’ has had a number of homes. It had no permanent home of its own for the first four years of its existence, but opened its first rooms of its own in the Arundel Hotel in 1888, then moved to No. 8 Haymarket in 1889 and remained there until 1907, when it moved to Swallow Street, Piccadilly. It stayed there until destroyed in The Blitz in 1941. Since then it has leased premises in several other London clubs. Today, the Club leases rooms in the Savile Club, 69 Brook Street in central London. Notable members *Basil Field *R. B. Marston *Frederic M.

It is a depiction of the early years of the samurai Horibe Yasubei, who was one of the Forty-seven Ronin. The film is also known as Chronicle of Pale Cherry Blossoms, a poetic reference to the Forty-Seven Ronin. Plot The film features Raizo Ichikawa as Tange Tanzen, and Shintaro Katsu as Yasubei Nakayama (later becoming Yasubei Horibe when he is adopted into another family), and opens with Yasubei simultaneously dueling several members of a rival dojo (school of swordsmanship). Yasubei deftly beats his opponents, but is expelled from his school as a result so as not to create enmity between the two schools. Tange, who is the best swordsmen of the defeated school, is expelled from the school because he was present at the duel but failed to intervene to help his fellow dojo-mates. He argued that he could not interfere because he was then on shogunate duties, but his colleagues accused him of cowardice and he was thereby expelled. After his expulsion, Tange comes across the maiden Chiharu, who was being attacked by feral dogs. Tange protects Chiharu (a member of the Uesugi Clan) and in the process kills one of the attacking \\"noble\\" dogs. However, the act carries with it the penalty of death due to the current Shogun's affinity for dogs. Yasubei helps to cover up Tange's act, but only as a way to become closer to Chiharu. It is because of his hidden affection for Chiharu that Yasubei considers aligning with the Uesugi clan (which is loyal to Chamberlain Kira who is later targeted for a revenge killing by the 47 Ronin). When Yasubei disposes of the dead dog off a river bridge, he is approached by several members of the defeated school seeking revenge. Tange, feeling indebted to Yasubei for Yasubei's covering up Tange's killing of the feral dog, fights off Yasubei's would be assassins, who are also Tange's former dojo-mates. Through watching Tange, Yasubei ascertains that Tange may very well be his equal in sword fighting. Meanwhile, Chiharu and Tange become closer due to his rescue of her and their frequent meetings at shrine. Yasubei, who had decided to declare his love for Chiharu and was about to accept an offer to join her Uesugi family, changes his mind upon learning of Tange and Chiharu's engagement and insteads join the Asano clan. On Hinamatsuri, Chiharu is seen showering affection on a doll that represents Tange, who is currently away in Kyoto. Chiharu is then kidnapped and raped by the same attackers seeking revenge against Tange for helping Yasubei. Tange learns of this, and as a result of the samurai code, the dynamic between his wife and him changes. He is within rights under the samurai code to kill her or to divorce her, but the latter would force Chiharu to commit seppuku. Chiharu feeling dishonored pleads that Tange kill her, but Tange ignores the request. He still loves her and wants to protect her, but under the samurai code, cannot remain her husband and cannot not show as much attention to her as before. Eventually, Tange hatches a scheme (the \\"fox\\" did it) that enables him to divorce Chiharu without forcing her to commit suicide. He resigns his post to become a ronin and hunt down the five men who brought about his current circumstances. Despite Tange's attempts to remain respectful to Chiharu's family through everything, Chiharu's brother is infuriated with Tange and challenges to a duel. As penitence, Tange allows Chiharu's brother to cut off his right arm and says his right arm is the price he is paying for returning Chiharu to her family. Tange disappears and everyone is wondering about his fate. He later appears after healing as a street performer, challenging anyone that would face the one armed swordsman, in the hopes that the men he sought would participate. His scheme is successful as one of the five kidnappers see him performing. Yasubei, in the meanwhile, had joined the Asano family, become engaged to the young 11-year-old daughter in the family, and changed his name to Horibe Yasubei. The Asano clan, as Chambara fans know well, is at the center of the story behind the classic film \\"47 Ronin,\\" and Yasubei and his fellow ronin are in the process of seeking revenge against Chamberlain Kira for his actions resulting in the disbanding of the Asano clan. These story lines intersect when the five kidnappers are part of the group protecting Chamberlain Kira. The Asano clan has decided to attack Chamberlain Kira on the day of an upcoming tea ceremony, and in the process of planning, Yasubei once again comes across Chiharu and remembers that she is close to the tea master handling the upcoming tea ceremony. Chiharu, in the meantime, had left her brother (and her family) to become an independent woman. Tange's chance for vengeance arrives when three of the kidnappers run into Tange on the streets. Tange is able to kill two of them but is shot in the leg by the third. Chiharu finds him in the street and takes him under her care. The remaining three men seeking to strike Tange while he is at his most vulnerable, challenge Tange to a \\"fair\\" duel, and recruits the other Kira guardmens to seek revenge against the one-armed, shot in the leg Tange. Tange is able to defend himself in what can be called Raizo Ichikawa's most definitive one-against-all scenes next to his performance in the film Betrayal. Chiharu comes upon the scene and is shot trying to run to Tange to help. Yasubei, who has been secretly following Chiharu to discover the date for the tea ceremony, also comes upon the scene and helps Tange, killing all the remaining attackers. However, Tange is fatally injured in the battle and Chiharu also dies from her gunshot wound. But before she dies, she tells Yasubei the date of the tea ceremony, showing her loyalty to her old friend and showing that she no longer had any ties or loyalty to her former Uesagi family, retainers of Chamberlain Kira. The story closes with the final march of the 47 Ronin (including Yasubei) and their assault on Chamberlain Kira's home. One must assume that chances for the successful assault were improved when 15 to 20 of the Kira guardmens were killed earlier in their futile revenge attack on Tange.

However, most Muslims are generally not pacifists, as the teachings in the Qur'an and Hadith allow for wars to be fought if they can be justified.

Prior to the Hijra travel Muhammad struggled non-violently against his opposition in Mecca.Boulding, Elise. \\"Cultures of Peace: The Hidden Side of History\\", p. 57 It was not until after the exile that the Quranic revelations began to adopt a more offensive perspective.Howard, Lawrence. \\"Terrorism: Roots, Impact, Responses\\", p. 48 Fighting in self-defense is not only legitimate but considered obligatory upon Muslims, according to the Qur'an.

Warfare in defense of the faith has also been part of Muslim history since the time of Muhammad, with violence mentioned in Quranic revelations after his exile from Mecca.Howard, Lawrence. Terrorism: Roots, Impact, Responses, p. 48 In the 13th century, Salim Suwari a philosopher in Islam, came up with a peaceful approach to Islam known as the Suwarian tradition. The Senegalese sufi sheykh Amadou Bamba (1850–1927) spearheaded a non-violent resistance movement against French colonialism in West Africa. Amadou Bamba repeatedly rejected calls for jihad against the Europeans, preaching hard work, piety and education as the best means to resist the oppression and exploitation of his people. The earliest massive non-violent implementation of civil disobedience was brought about by Egyptians against British occupation in the Egyptian Revolution of 1919. Zaghloul Pasha, considered the mastermind behind this massive civil disobedience, was a native middle-class, Azhar graduate, political activist, judge, parliamentary and ex-Cabinet Minister whose leadership brought Muslim and Christian communities together as well as women into the massive protests. Along with his companions of Wafd Party, who started campaigning in 1914, they have achieved independence of Egypt and a first constitution in 1923. According to Margaret Chatterjee, Mahatma Gandhi was influenced by Sufi Islam. She states that Gandhi was acquainted with the Sufi Chishti Order, whose Khanqah gatherings he attended, and was influenced by Sufi values such as humility, selfless devotion, identification with the poor, belief in human brotherhood, the oneness of God, and the concept of Fana. David Hardiman notes that Gandhi's garb was similar that of Sufi pirs and fakirs, which was also noted by Winston Churchill when he compared Gandhi to a fakir. According to Amitabh Pal, Gandhi followed a strand of Hinduism that bore similarities to Sufi Islam. During the Indian independence movement, several Muslim organizations played a key role in nonviolent resistance against British imperialism, including Khān Abdul Ghaffār Khān and his followers, as well as the All-India Muslim League led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Khān Abdul Ghaffār Khān (6 February 1890 – 20 January 1988) (), nicknamed Bāchā Khān (Pashto: , lit. \\"king of chiefs\\") or Pāchā Khān (), was a Pashtun independence activist against the rule of the British Raj. He was a political and spiritual leader known for his nonviolent opposition, and a lifelong pacifist and devout Muslim.An American Witness to India's Partition by Phillips Talbot Year (2007) Sage Publications A close friend of Mohandas Gandhi, Bacha Khan was nicknamed the \\"Frontier Gandhi\\" in British India. Bacha Khan founded the Khudai Khidmatgar (\\"Servants of God\\") movement in 1929, whose success triggered a harsh crackdown by the British Empire against him and his supporters, and they suffered some of the most severe repression of the Indian independence movement. Khan strongly opposed the All-India Muslim League's demand for the partition of India. When the Indian National Congress declared its acceptance of the partition plan without consulting the Khudai Khidmatgar leaders, he felt very sad and told the Congress \\"you have thrown us to the wolves.\\" After partition, Badshah Khan pledged allegiance to Pakistan and demanded an autonomous \\"Pashtunistan\\" administrative unit within the country, but he was frequently arrested by the Pakistani government between 1948 and 1954. In 1956, he was again arrested for his opposition to the One Unit program, under which the government announced to merge the former provinces of West Punjab, Sindh, North-West Frontier Province, Chief Commissioner's Province of Balochistan, and Baluchistan States Union into one single polity of West Pakistan. Badshah Khan also spent much of the 1960s and 1970s either in jail or in exile. Upon his death in 1988 in Peshawar under house arrest, following his will, he was buried at his house in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. Tens of thousands of mourners attended his funeral, marching through the Khyber Pass from Peshawar to Jalalabad, although it was marred by two bomb explosions killing 15 people. Despite the heavy fighting at the time, both sides of the Soviet–Afghan War, the communist army and the mujahideen, declared a ceasefire to allow his burial.January 23, 1988 edition of the New York Times The Palestinian activist Nafez Assaily has been notable for his bookmobile service in Hebron dubbed \\"Library on Wheels for Nonviolence and Peace\\",Minke De Vries, Verso una gratuità feconda.

Aside from its flat bottom, another prominent feature of that is its lack of deck. The boat has a mast with a direct sail and is steered by oars. The single mast usually measures in length. There is also a large space reserved for cargo (see image). It has a load-carrying capacity of . Usually, pauzoks accompany big vessels because they are useful for cargo transportation in shoals. These boats are mainly built in the northern regions of Russia, particularly Volga, Lena River, and in other places. Pauzoks are also used to deliver cargo to the coast or in carrying cargo in sections where the river bed has a relatively steep slope. This boat is stable and can independently navigate the rapids. There were cases when pauzoks broke in the coast. If the boat encounters this difficulty, the crew often uses a long, thick, and wide board which in Siberia is called Opleukha ( Translated: slap in the face). This is the part that the oarsmen use as a lever to move the vessel towards a current. A small dam is formed, and small rising of water raises the pauzok and it can be pushed off from a bank on a deep-water place. ;Facts:Delivery of cargoes to Lensky polar station were made on the Lena River with active use of pauzoks.

It appeared most prominently in a 1937 paper by Luther Gulick (in a set edited by himself and Lyndall Urwick). However, he first presented the concept in 1935. Initially, POSDCORB was envisioned in an effort to develop public service professionals. In Gulick's own words, the elements are as follows: Planning, Organizing, Staffing, Directing, Co-Ordinating, Reporting and Budgeting.  Coining of the acronym  In his piece \\"Notes on the Theory of Organization\\", a memo prepared while he was a member of the Brownlow Committee, Luther Gulick asks rhetorically \\"What is the work of the chief executive? What does he do?\\" POSDCORB is the answer, \\"designed to call attention to the various functional elements of the work of a chief executive because 'administration' and 'management' have lost all specific content.\\" According to Gulick, the elements are: *Planning *Organizing *Staffing *Directing *Co-ordinating *Reporting *Budgeting  Elaborations  Gulick's \\"Notes on the Theory of Organization\\" further defines the patterns of POSDCORB. That document explains how portions of an executive's workload may be delegated, and that some of the elements can be organized as subdivisions of the executive depending on the size and complexity of the enterprise. Under Organizing, Gulick emphasized the division and specialization of labor in a manner that would increase efficiency. Yet Gulick observed that there were limitations. Based on his practical experience, he carefully articulated the many factors. Gulick described how the organization of workers could be done in four ways. According to him, these are related and may be multi-level. Specifically, they are: *By the purpose the workers are serving, such as furnishing water, providing education, or controlling crime. Gulick lists these in his organizational tables as vertical organizations. *By the process the workers are using, such as engineering, doctoring, lawyering, or statistics. Gulick lists these in his organizational tables as horizontal organizations. *By the clientele or material: the persons or things being dealt with, such as immigrants, veterans, forests, mines, or parks in government; or such as a department store's furniture department, clothing department, hardware department, or shoe department in the private sector. *By the place where the workers do their work. Gulick stresses how these modes of organization often cross, forming interrelated structures. Organizations like schools may include workers and professionals not in the field of education such as nurses. How they are combined or carefully aggregated into a school — or a school system — is of concern. But the early work of Gulick was not limited to small organizations. He started off his professional career at New York City's Bureau of Municipal Research and advanced to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Committee on Administrative Management. Under Coordination, Gulick notes that two methods can be used to achieve coordination of divided labor. The first is by organization, or placing workers under managers who coordinate their efforts. The second is by dominance of an idea, where a clear idea of what needs to be done is developed in each worker, and each worker fits their work to the needs of the whole. Gulick notes that these two ideas are not mutually exclusive, and that most enterprises function best when both are utilized. Gulick notes that any manager will have a finite amount of time and energy, and discusses span of control under coordination. Drawing from the work of Henri Fayol, Gulick notes that the number of subordinates that can be handled under any single manager will depend on factors such as organizational stability and the specialization of the subordinates. Gulick stops short of giving a definite number of subordinates that any one manager can control, but authors such as Sir Ian Hamilton and Lyndall Urwick have settled on numbers between three and six. Span of control was later expanded upon and defended in depth by Lyndall Urwick in his 1956 piece The Manager's Span of Control. Under coordination, as well as organization, Gulick emphasizes the theory of unity of command: that each worker should only have one direct superior so as to avoid confusion and inefficiency. Gulick discusses the concept of a holding company which may perform limited coordinating, planning, or budgeting functions. Subsidiary entities may carry out their work with autonomy, but as the holding company allows, based upon their authority and direction.  Influence from French administration theory  Luther Gulick, one of the Brownlow Committee authors, states that his statement of work of a chief executive is adapted from the functional analysis elaborated by Henri Fayol in his \\"Industrial and General Administration\\". Indeed, Fayol's work includes fourteen principles and five elements of management that lay the foundations of Gulick's POSDCORB. Fayol's fourteen principles of management are as follows: *Division of Work: The division of work principle declares that staffs function better when assigned tasks according to their specialties. *Authority and Responsibility: This principle proposes the requirement for managers or manager like authority in order to effectively direct subordinates to perform their jobs while still being held accountable for their conduct. *Discipline: The discipline principle supports strict and clearly defined rules and regulations in the workplace to ensure professional employee behavior and order. *Unity of Command: The unity of command doctrine proclaims that employees should only receive command and report to one administrator or boss-like authority figure. *Unity of Direction: The unity of direction principle states that there should only be one plan, one objective and one director head for each specific plan. *Subordination of Individual Interest to General Interest: The subordination of Individual interest to general interest principle declares that the interests and objectives of the organization overrides the interests of any employee, management staff, or any group. *Remuneration of Personnel: The remuneration of personnel principle deems that both staff and management salary should be fairly earned, justifiable and no party should be deceived. *Centralization: The centralization principle advocates that managerial decision making should be centralized with orders being delivered from top tier management to the middle management, where the orders are arranged and then clarified for the line staff to execute. *Scalar Chain (line of authority with peer level communication): The scalar chain principle contends that communication within the organization should only be one uninterrupted vertical flow of communication and any other type of communication should only occur in times of emergencies and when approved by a manager. *Order: The order principle can be interpreted in either of the two ways; some believe this principle refers to giving every material in the organization its right position while other believe it means delegating the right job to the right employee. *Equity: The equity principle proclaims that managers should be fair and impartial to their staff but the relationship should still be in compliance with the principle of subordination of individual interest to general. *Stability of Tenure of Personnel: The stability of tenure of personnel principle states that management should employ the right staff and properly train them in hopes of retaining their employment for a long time and benefiting the organization through experience and expertise. *Initiative: The initiative principle refers to the management and their creativity and their ability to implement them within the organization to ensure growth and success in the organization. *Esprit de Corps: The Esprit de Corps principle believes that organizations should promote high morale and unity to retain the best employees for lengthy periods of time. Henri Fayol's influence is also visibly apparent in Luther Gulick's five elements of management discussed as in his book, which are as follows: *Planning - examining the future and drawing up plans of actions *Organizing - building up the structure (labor and material) of the undertaking *Command - maintaining activity among the personnel *Co-ordination - unifying and harmonizing activities and efforts *Control - seeing that everything occurs in conformity with policies and practices  Role in management and public administration history  POSDCORB and its humble beginnings in the Brownlow Committee literature is still heavily referenced in today's public administration and politics. Many public administrators even believe the Brownlow documents initiated \\"the Reorganization Act of 1939, a train of measures that the act set in motion can reasonably be attributed to it\\". POSDCORB management theories that are also responsible for the administrative reorganization that occurred around 1937, which utilizes Gulick's organizing and coordinating steps in the POSDCORB administrative process providing for more concise departments and even room for new agencies within the government making for a more efficient government. POSDCORB generally fits into the classical management movement, being classified as an element of social scientific management, which was popular in the late 19th and early 20th century. Gulick's POSDCORB patterns were instrumental in highlighting the theory of span of control, or limits on the number of people one manager could supervise, as well as unity of command to the fields of management and public administration. According to notable Public Administration scholars such as Nicholas Henry, POSDCORB, the principles it represents, and subsequent expansions upon the POSDCORB concept form the height of Public Administration in an era when it was seen as just another aspect of the field of management as a whole. Gulick's work has been heavily cited and expanded upon by scholars and practitioners in the fields of management and public administration since the publication of Papers on the Science of Administration in 1937. In his 1987 piece \\"Deja Vu: French Antecedents of American Public Administration,\\" French public administrator, Daniel Martin notes that virtually all of the principles in American Public Administration up to 1937 and the coining of the POSDCORB acronym, including the POSDCORB principles, were present in the French literature on the subject by 1859, but that this literature had largely been forgotten by the theorists of that era, thus the \\"re-invention\\" of these principles in the later French and American literature. Essentially, \\"The highest goals of the American Administrative State are the same today as they were in 1937 and in 1787: Public administration is first and foremost concerned with upholding the democratic values embedded within our constitutional heritage.\\"  Criticisms  As early as 1938, literature began appearing in the field of public administration challenging the validity of POSDCORB and the concept that there could even be a rigid set of principles in administration. In 1946 and 1947, prominent Public Administration scholars such as Robert Dahl, Dwight Waldo, and Herbert A. Simon released articles and books criticising POSDCORB and the principles notion. Simon's article Proverbs of Administration challenges the POSDCORB principles by stating \\"For almost every principle one can find an equally plausible and acceptable contradictory principle.\\" Among other criticisms, Simon states that the POSDCORB principles are an oversimplification of administration. Simon's criticisms largely center around span of control and unity of command, stating that sometimes it is necessary for a subordinate to receive guidance or directives from more than one source, as well as Gulick's division of labor concepts. Other criticisms of Simon involved that there was a lack of evidence for the POSDCORB. Yet others argue that organizations are full of variety and are challenging to control. Strength of POSDCORB POSDCORB generally fits into the Classical Management movement, being classified as an element of scientific management. Gulick POSDCORB principles were instrumental in highlighting the theory of span of control, or limits on the number of people one manager could supervise, as well as the unity of command to the fields of management and public administration.

He moved to France as a young boy in 1758. His first involvement in politics included organizing elections to the Estates General in Marennes and a short stint as mayor of Marennes from January 1790 through July 1790. He also served as administrator of the département of Charente- Inférieure for the district of Marennes, beginning in June 1790. In November 1790, he was elected vice president of the administration. Bréard served on the National Assembly as a representative of Charente- Inférieure and was elected as a deputy to the National Convention, once again representing Charente- Inférieure. He served briefly as President of the National Convention in February 1793. More importantly, Bréard served on the Committee of General Security from October 1792 to January 1793, as well as the Committee of Public Safety from April 1793 to June 1793, July 1794 to December 1794, and January 1795 to May 1795.http://www.archontology.org/nations/france/convention_1792_95/breard.php. 26 Oct. 2009.  Revolution  During his time on the Committee of Public Safety, Bréard was sent on mission to Brest to manage the organization of a more effective coastal defense in the vital naval town. When Jean Bon Saint- André departed from Brest for a brief period, Bréard was left in charge, and succumbed to the demands of his overzealous and unruly followers. He authorized the formation of a Revolutionary Tribunal during the beginning of the Terror, despite Saint André’s opposition. He was bullied by the local Jacobin Club into placing Jacobin allies, many of them incompetent and inexperienced, into offices carrying responsibility. Bréard also dispatched activist groups into neighboring districts to indoctrinate the local people with their radical brand of republicanism, including the corrupt agitator Dagorne.Palmer. Twelve Who Ruled, p. 217. In September 1793, a planned naval mutiny was uncovered, and Bréard ordered the imprisonment of thirty members of the fleet. A full investigation into the mutiny did not commence until Saint André arrived back five days later.Cormack. Revolution and Political Conflict, p. 226. When Saint André returned to Brest he mitigated Bréard’s more radical measures, and returned emphasis to construction and other infrastructure projects.Palmer. Twelve Who Ruled, p. 218. Bréard was originally replaced in his post at Brest by Laignelot, who favored implementing even more radical measures. Laignelot was subsequently reproached by Saint André.Cormack. Revolution and Political Conflict, p. 258. However, as France shifted to an offensive posture in preparation for a planned naval invasion of Britain, some harsh policies remained in place to prevent insurrection or instability. Although Bréard was originally a member of the Montagnard faction, he supported the Thermidorian Reaction that began with Robespierre’s downfall in July 1794. He outlasted the collapse of the Committee of Public Safety and Robespierre’s faction, and served in the Conseil des Anciens (Council of Ancients) as a deputy of Charente-Inférieure from 1795 to 1798. He also supported the coup of Brumaire 18 in 1799, orchestrated by Abbé Sieyès, by which the Directory was overthrown and replaced with the French Consulate, with General Napoleon Bonaparte at the helm.http://www.archontology.org/nations/france/convention_1792_95/breard.php. Accessed 26 Oct. 2009.  Later life  Bréard was nominated to the Corps Législatif in 1799, and served as President of the Corps Législatif for two weeks from January 6, 1801 to January 21, 1801. He worked as an administrator of the Paris post office, was banished in 1816 after the Restoration, and did not return to France until 1830. He died on January 2, 1840 in Paris.http://www.archontology.org/nations/france/convention_1792_95/breard.php. Accessed 26 Oct. 2009.

He felt that this experience radicalized him — claiming that he experienced racism, and began to feel strong opposition to fighting against the Vietnamese, who he felt were struggling for their right to self-determination. After returning from Vietnam, Levasseur moved to Tennessee, where he began attending college. There, he began working with the Southern Student Organizing Committee (SSOC). In 1969, Levasseur was arrested for attempting to sell six dollars' worth of marijuana to an undercover police officer. Even though he had no prior criminal history, due to his political activism, Levasseur was given the maximum penalty of 5 years in prison. He was sent to the Tennessee State Penitentiary, where he spent 2 years in solitary confinement, before being released on parole. He then moved back to Maine, where he began working with Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW), and the Statewide Correctional Alliance for Reform (SCAR), a prisoners'-rights organization. It is while working with these activist groups in Maine, that Levasseur met his future wife, Pat Gros. In 1975 Levasseur co-founded the Sam Melville/Jonathan Jackson Unit with Tom Manning, Pat Gros (Rowbottom) and Carol Manning which eventually became known as the United Freedom Front. From 1975 to 1984 the UFF carried out several robberies as well as bombings targeted at corporations and institutions supporting the South African apartheid regime and US foreign policy in Central America.Raymond Luc Levasseur Trial transcripts, 1989, University of Massachusetts Special Collections and University Archives.

According to the Special Agents, Levasseur kicked an Agent but otherwise surrendered without a struggle. A 9-millimeter pistol was found in the van, and the couple's three children, who were in the van, were turned over to juvenile authorities, the Agents said. (New York Times) Conviction and imprisonment Levasseur and six of his comrades were eventually convicted of conspiracy in 1986 and sentenced to long terms.

Retrieved April 1, 2013 The trial ended in an acquittal on most charges and a hung jury on the rest. After the conspiracy charge in 1986, Levasseur was sentenced to 45 years in prison, and was sent immediately to Control Unit of the supermax prison, USP Marion. While there, he refused to work for the prison labor corporation UNICOR, producing weapons for the U.S. Department of Defense. In 1994 he was transferred to ADX Florence in Colorado. In 1999 he was transferred to the Atlanta Federal Prison, where he was released from solitary confinement for the first time in 13 years.

Many critics likened the game to the Pokémon series, but praised the game's unique qualities. In Japan, the game inspired merchandise based on the Metal Walker robots. Metal Walker's battles are unique from other games in the genre due to their billiard-style nature. Players move their Metal Walkers across the battlefield by hitting them into items, walls, or enemy Metal Walkers. The 2013 mobile game Monster Strike has a similar concept and gameplay mechanics but is otherwise unconnected to Metal Walker. Gameplay Although Metal Walker is a console RPG, battles are fought in a pinball or billiards-like atmosphere in a top-down perspective arena. As each turn of the battle starts, players decide which direction a Metal Walker will move and how hard they will move. Players are encouraged to form strategies that allow Metal Walkers to hit a single enemy, bounce off a wall, and then hit another enemy, all in a single turn. On the battlefield, players can throw several different types of items onto the field. The items are used when a Metal Walker hits them. Capsules and healing items strengthen and heal Metal Walkers, whereas attack items, such as Napalm, are only useful when the enemy hits them. There also exist Analyzers, which provide the player with Scan Data for any Metal Walker that is bounced into them. Scrap metal won after the battle can then be used with the Scan Data to create new Metal Walkers or purchase items. When an enemy is destroyed, the player's Metal Walker will gain experience points and an item might be obtained. If the player's Metal Walker runs out of Hit points, the player will lose half of the carried scraps and have to start from the last save point. Outside of battle, players explore a top-down overworld where they can explore various towns and dungeons. Most battles occur as random encounters. The overworld has several interactable elements, such as water, which the player needs a certain number of Cores to cross. The player can only carry one Metal Walker at a time and it will follow the main character on the overworld. By defeating the game's bosses, players earn Core Units, which allow Metal Walkers to evolve into new, stronger forms. Plot Metal Walker takes place late in the 21st Century when a valuable and evolving metal known as Core is discovered on an island. Military leaders sought to use Core to develop weapons, but an accident turned the island into a ruined wasteland. The Rusted Land, as it is called, is where the game takes place. Because of the research, the island is scattered with malicious robots known as Metal Busters.Tetsuo: Run! The Metal Busters are coming! They are evil robots who hurt humans! Fifty years after the accident, the main character and his father Tetsuo Kurama have devoted their lives to search for lost Core Units on the island, but the game opens as the father is separated from his son as a gang of Metal Busters attack. The main character and his Metal Walker, Meta Ball, must then search for his father on the island. Professor Hawk, Tetsuo's employer tells the main character that his father will be found where there are Core Units, so he then goes to seek them out. Reception Typical battle scenario Metal Walker found praise among its critics, particularly for the game's unique \\"science fiction spin\\" on the Pokémon series. Gerald Valloria of GameSpot.com said of the game that \\"Metal Walker is a more than worthwhile endeavor for anyone that is in between Pokémon games, and it can serve as an alternative for those fans of RPGs that might be too ashamed to look someone in the eye and say, \\"Yeah, I'm playing Pokémon, what of it?\\" The game earned a three out of five in Nintendo Power. Although calling the game \\"fun\\" and \\"engaging\\", GamePro called the game a \\"shameless Pokémon rip-off.\\" A review by Gamebits.net gave the game a lower than average score, calling it an RPG that's \\"more mathematical than magical.\\" References External links Metal Walker at allgame.com 1999 video games Capcom games Game Boy Color games Role- playing video games Top-down video games Game Boy Color-only games Multiplayer and single-player video games Video games developed in Japan ","title":"Metal Walker"},{"id":"25058197","text":"Particle accelerators in popular culture is about popular science books, fictional literature, feature films, TV series and other venues which include particle accelerators as part of their content.

Particle acceleration is used to lasso the ghosts for easy entrapment. =Iron Man 2= The Iron Man 2 features a makeshift particle accelerator used by Tony Stark to create a new chemical element, more biologically inert than the palladium used in the arc reactor. =Angels & Demons= The movie version of the book has footage filmed on-site at one of the experiments at the LHC; the director, Ron Howard, met with CERN experts in an effort to make the science in the story more accurate. =Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines= Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines features a particle accelerator that traps the metallic T-X Terminatrix in its powerful electromagnetic field, buying time for the protagonists to get a head start in their escape. Particle accelerators in TV series =FlashForward= FlashForward was an American science-fiction television series which aired for one season on ABC. It was loosely based on the 1999 novel Flashforward by Canadian science fiction writer Robert J. Sawyer. It ran from September 24, 2009 through May 27, 2010. =The Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers= The Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers episode \\"Trouble at Texton\\" featured a particle accelerator on the moon Texton, operated by a mad scientist determined to prove the existence of parallel universes. =The Sparticle Mystery= A particle accelerator is the cause of the adults disappearing in the CBBC science fiction drama, The Sparticle Mystery. =Terra Nova= In Terra Nova the rift in spacetime that allows time travel is a natural phenomenon discovered by scientists working at Fermilab. Hope Plaza, the facility holding the time portal has two large semicircles in its structure, presumably the accelerator itself. =The Flash (2014 TV series)= In the 2014 TV series The Flash, a scientist by the name of Harrison Wells (portrayed by Tom Cavanagh) creates a particle accelerator in the year 2020, which is not successful and creates metahumans (humans with supernatural powers), including Barry Allen / The Flash. However, in the year 2024, the Flash is forced to time travel as he sees that the man in the yellow suit (the Flash's main villain) will travel as well to the year 2000, to kill the Flash as a child. The man in yellow (whose name is Eobard Thawne) fails to kill the younger Barry and angered, kills his mother; he later finds out that he can’t go back to his time due to fighting the Flash. He finds Dr. Wells at a beach and sets a trap for him when Wells and his wife pass by Starling City, killing Wells' wife but with Dr. Wells still surviving. Thawne uses a device to steal Well's identity (which kills him as well) and quickly constructs the building of S.T.A.R. Labs (which Wells built way later in his time). He also builds the particle accelerator quickly as well (Wells built it in 2020) because he wants to confront the Flash sooner, gain his speed, and travel back to his time. The particle accelerator once again is a failure, creating metahumans all over again. In the episode \\"Grodd Lives\\", Thawne puts a device in the used-up particle accelerator, allowing him to go back to his time; however, he willingly allows himself to fight the Flash one more time. Particle accelerators in video games =Another World= In the 1991 video game Another World, the intro shows the player working with a particle accelerator. His laboratory is struck by lightning during an experiment, and the particle accelerator malfunctions - teleporting him to an alien world. =Scribblenauts= In the 2009 video game Scribblenauts, the Large Hadron Collider creates a black hole. Particle accelerators in table top & role playing games =Tales from the Loop= A huge underground particle accelerator known as the Loop is both a major plot point in, and a key element of the lore behind, this 2017 alternate history RPG table top game.
