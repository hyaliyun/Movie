A peptide library contains a great number of peptides that have a systematic combination of amino acids. Usually, peptide library is synthesized on solid phase, mostly on resin, which can be made as flat surface or beads. The peptide library provides a powerful tool for drug design, protein–protein interactions, and other biochemical as well as pharmaceutical applications. You can create a mix of desired amino acids at each point in a sequence. In this way, you could create a library of 20 different polypeptides with only one amino acid residue at random and the rest being the same. The usefulness of this form of peptide synthesis is limited as you can't go beyond 70 acids in length. This would give you 2070 possible combinations and that's only if you don't include the plethora of available amino acids with pre-installed post-translational modifications. Most drug development does not involve such a random assortment of proteins as you wouldn't learn very much. Important example. Say you wanted a peptide chain 10 residues in length to use in native chemical ligation with a larger recombinantly expressed protein. *Chosen out of complete randomness*you want a set of proteins with the following. residue 1: Alanine only residue 2: glutamine, glycine, arginine, glutamic acid, serine, or methionine residue 3: any one of all 20 amino acids residue 4: acetyl-lysine only residue 5: alanine residue 6: isoleucine residue 7: aspartic acid residue 8: phenylalanine residue 9: acetyl-lysine residue 10: argineine with the carboxy terminal thioester. there would be 20 different proteins at residue 3. each one of those would have 7 different proteins at residue 2. the end result would be 20*7 or 140 different polypeptides. this peptide library would be useful for analyzing the effect of the post-translational modification acetylation on lysine which neutralizes the positive charge. having the library of different peptides at residue 2 and 3 would let you see if some change in chemical properties in the N-terminal tail of the ligated protein make the protein more useful or useful in a different way. As a general formula, if you made a completely random peptide library with n amino acids for each link in the chain with a length of x, the total number of possible sequences is n^x.

Biography Born in Perth, Canada West, Motherwell attended the Ontario Agricultural College, graduating in 1881; then worked that summer in Portage la Prairie, Manitoba. The following year he spring he returned to the prairies joining settlers in who traveled by rail to Brandon, Manitoba, then by red river cart and wagon beyond to the area of Abernethy, Saskatchewan, where he settled and constructed the Motherwell Homestead.

He served in the provincial legislator from 1905 to 1918, Saskatchewan Minister of Agriculture from 1906-1917. His resignation from the provincial legislature was in protest over the provincial Liberal Party's support for conscription and reduction in French language rights. He first ran as the Liberal candidate for the House of Commons of Canada for the Saskatchewan riding of Assiniboia in a 1919 by-election. Although defeated, he was elected in the riding of Regina in the 1921 federal election. He was re- elected in 1925, 1926, 1930, and 1935 for the riding of Melville. From 1921 to 1930, he was the Minister of Agriculture, except for a short period in 1926.

Usman Memorial Foundation was formed in 1973 in the memory of Late Mohammad Usman, by his family members, friends and well-wishers. Mr. A.K. Brohi was the first President, while Dr. Manzoor Ahmad was the Secretary General of the Foundation. There were two Usman Memorial Scholarship awarded to research scholars namely Dr. Syeda Khatoon for research entitled \\"An Analysis of Religion Philosophy of Sir Syed Ahmed\\" and Dr. Rasheed Ahmed Jalandri for research entitled \\"Deoband Movement and Religious reforms\\". Both the research papers were published in the shape of a book. In 1994, the Foundation established Usman Institute of Technology (UIT) on the plot of land allotted to the Foundation located at Abul Hasan Isphahani Road, with total contribution from the Hasham family. History Usman Institute of TechnologyUIT had its genesis due to an endowment from the Hasham family of the Memon community in remembrance of Mohammad Usman Hasham, son of Haji Hasham, a tycoon and a philanthropist. Haji Hasham started his business career at the age of 11 in India early in the 20th century. After moving to Karachi in 1936, he started to expand his business. Industrial concerns like Mehran Sugar Mills, Mogul Tobacco, Pakistan Molasses Company, Usman Textile were part of his business. His sons had a desire to do something for the welfare of the community. Among his sons was a student of Dr. Manzoor Ahmad, a scholar and Dean of the Department of Philosophy at Karachi University. Usman was influenced by Dr. Manzoor's philosophy and shared his humanist values. Usman died in 1973 at the age of 38 due to brain haemorrhage. However, his father and brothers, wanting to keep his memory alive, decided to make Usman's dreams a reality. Following the advice of Usman’s mentor, Dr. Manzoor Ahmad and with the patronage of lawyer and writer, late Mr. A.K. Brohi, the ‘Usman Memorial Foundation’ was founded in 1973. Mr. Brohi agreed to be the President and Dr. Manzoor Ahmad was requested to be General Secretary of the Foundation. The Foundation organized lectures by scholars, established a library and offered research scholarships. The Foundation acquired a piece of land in 1976 on the University Road to establish an educational institution. Eventually at the suggestion of Mr. Ebrahim Hasham and with the financial assistance of the Hasham Family, the Usman Institute of Technology was established in 1995 in affiliation with Technical University of Nova Scotia, Canada. In 1997, Usman Memorial Foundation signed an Agreement with Hamdard University for awarding their degrees to UIT students. Dr. Manzoor Ahmad, was made the Life Chairman of the Executive Board of UIT.Inside the institute UIT side view.

The discussions in this club are very analytical in nature and have developed strong communication skills among the students. Sessions of Reader's Club are arranged and organized by students on topics set or voted by students on their facebook page. Topics regarding current events, no matter how controversial, have been discussed in previous sessions. All sessions are chaired by Mufti Emad-ul-Haq. Faculty members from various departments also join the sessions along with students. Another aim of this club is to develop interpersonal and communication skills among engineering students who are otherwise perceived to be shy. International Partnership Due to UIT’s linkage with Dalhousie University of Canada, not less than 40 UIT students are continuing their education at Dalhousie University. A number of them after graduating from there have joined UIT faculty. Professors from Dalhousie University visit UIT to conduct guest lectures.

This principle was formulated in slightly different versions by the Danish chemist Julius Thomsen in 1854 and by the French chemist Marcellin Berthelot in 1864. This early postulate in classical thermochemistry became the controversial foundation of a research program that would last three decades. This principle came to be associated with what was called the thermal theory of affinity, which postulated that the heat evolved in a chemical reaction was the true measure of its affinity. This hypothesis was later disproved, however, when in 1882 the German scientist Hermann von Helmholtz proved that affinity was not given by the heat evolved in a chemical reaction but rather by the maximum work, or free energy, produced when the reaction was carried out reversibly.

Approximately 250 children were in attendance, the majority of those children were not accompanied by an adult. Survivors remembered the cry of fire and smoke quickly filling the air. Ushers, not realizing the danger, at first blocked the east balcony exit and urged the children to return to their seats. The exit doors opened inwards, meaning that the crush of those trying escape prevented them from being opened. The projectionist, Émile Massicotte, got thirty children away from the locked exit into the projection booth, then passed them out a window onto the marquee above the sidewalk, whence they descended fireman's ladders. One usher, Paul Champagne, helped direct evacuation at the other stairway that was not blocked; he and Massicotte were credited with preventing many more deaths, possibly well over 100. A fire station was across the street and firemen arrived quickly. but 12 children were crushed, 64 asphyxiated, and 2 children killed by the fire itself. Among the dead were the son of one firefighter and three children of a policeman who had been called to assist.  Aftermath  Plaque dedicated to the victims Memorial, Notre-Dame-des-Neiges Cemetery, Montreal On January 11, funeral services were held in l'Église de la Nativité (the Church of the Nativity), near the theatre, for 39 of the victims. More than 50,000 watched the funeral procession. During the homily, Father Georges Gauthier, co-archbishop of Montréal, wondered whether entertainment should be allowed on Sundays and suggested that children be barred from cinemas. There are a large number of songs based around the fire with the singer Hercule Lavoie singing about the fire with the words: Which, in English, translates to:  Political  The people seized upon the tragedy of the Laurier Palace Theatre as an opportunity to block children's access to the cinema in general, claiming that the cinema \\"ruins the health of children, weakens their lungs, troubles their imagination, excites their nervous system, harms their education, overexcites their sinful ideas and leads to immorality\\". A few months later Judge Louis Boyer recommended that everyone under 16 be forbidden access to cinema screenings. The following year, to appease extremists who wanted the cinema closed to all, such a law was passed\\"Our Local Hollywood Connections - Stan Laurel, Snow White and Quebec Cinema Laws\\", Montreal Mosaic. Retrieved February 6, 2017. and remained in effect for 33 years, until 1961. Building codes were also modified so that the doors of public buildings were required to open outwards. In 1967, the cinema law was further modified, setting up a motion picture rating system that divided the movie-going population into age groups of 18 and over, 14 and over, and general (for all).

They played in the League of Ireland First Division from 1996–97 until 2000–01. They currently play in the Leinster Senior League and operate a number of schoolboy and women's teams.http://www.stfrancisfc.ie/teams The club wear green and white hooped shirts. History Early years St Francis was founded by John Hyland and friends in 1958 initially as a schoolboy club. In 1968, the first adult side was introduced as St Francis joined the Athletic Union League, winning division 2A in their first season. In their second season St Francis won the FAI Junior Cup, the highest honour for junior sides. The club progressed into the intermediate ranks and soon become one of the top teams at that grade, winning the Leinster Senior League four times. In 1989–90 St Francis became the first non-League of Ireland side to reach an FAI Cup Final in over 50 years before finally losing to Bray Wanderers. Their fairytale story, combined with the final moving to Lansdowne Road saw a crowd of over 33,000 witness the historic final. League of Ireland years St Francis continued to be one of the top Leinster Senior League sides and when St. James's Gate were expelled from the League of Ireland First Division, St Francis were invited to apply along with two other clubs to take their place. The club's first senior game was a drab drawn tie against Longford Town in the League of Ireland Cup. Their first League of Ireland game ended in a 4–0 defeat to Waterford United on 11 October 1996. St Francis struggled to make an impact in the League of Ireland First Division. Both their traditional Liberties home and their adopted home of Clondalkin are areas which St Patrick's Athletic claim many fans from, and St Francis's crowds were small, even by First Division standards. In their five seasons in the league, St Francis never finished out of the bottom three. After finishing bottom for the third time in the 2000–01, director Alan Duncan approached St. Patrick's Athletic with a view to merging. St Pats managing director Pat Dolan was receptive to the idea and two weeks before the 2001–02 season, St Francis withdrew from the league. A hurriedly arranged joint press conference was called to announce the arrival of the Dublin Saints after the proposed merger was revealed on a website. St. Pats fans were outraged as their club announced plans to call the club St Patrick's Athletic including St Francis F.C.. In a meeting with St Francis supporters, Duncan spoke of his wish that the new club be officially renamed the Dublin Saints. As the season progressed, the merger talks broke down and the merger never materialised. Pats did use John Hyland Park for some friendlies and for underage games, but the ground was never in their possession as it was held in trust for use by St Francis only. After the League of Ireland St Francis did not field an adult team in 2001–02. However they regrouped and subsequently re-entered the Leinster Senior League. John Hyland Park St Francis play their home games at John Hyland Park in Baldonnel, close to Clondalkin.

His show also features co-hosts: Colty, the female plastic horse, Pervy, the larger male perverted plastic horse with racist issues, and Peanuts, a bag of polystyrene peanuts that can only be understood by Leavins. The show's popularity increased over time, and the weekly episodes attracted up to 100,000 views each. Chris abruptly ceased production of the show in June 2009, ostensibly prompted by one of his viewers, informing him of how the show had aged him. Chris later confirmed on his website that this episode would be the last in the series. On January 30, 2008, he performed a live version of the show for free at the 99-seat Hudson Theater in Hollywood, California. The show sold out in 85 minutes. Another two shows, this time charging money for tickets, were put on at the Theatre Centre, Toronto on April 19 and 20, 2008. Both sold out; the first in 20 minutes. Leavins has said that he sees this use of an Internet fan base to attract theatre audiences as a new model for success, and a solution to the difficulties that he experienced attracting audiences as a conventional writer and performer.

H. Pierce, was a Canadian First Nations missionary for the Methodist church and a member of the Tsimshian nation in northwestern British Columbia. He is best known for his memoir, From Potlatch to Pulpit, which was the first published book by a Tsimshian. Pierce was born June 10, 1856, at Fort Rupert, B.C. His father was a Scotsman named Edward Pierce who worked for the Hudson's Bay Company at Lax Kw'alaams (a.k.a. Port Simpson, a.k.a. Fort Simpson), B.C., and his mother was a Tsimshian of the Gispaxlo'ots tribe from Port Simpson who died when he was three weeks old. His maternal grandfather brought him from Fort Rupert to Port Simpson, where he was raised in Tsimshian culture. His \\"uncle by adoption\\" was the HBC employee and diarist Arthur Wellington Clah, and young William witnessed the famous event in which Clah intervened and saved the life of the Anglican lay missionary William Duncan, whose life was being threatened by Chief Ligeex of the Gispaxlo'ots, angry that church-bells were tolling on the day of his daughter's initiation into a secret society. During a stay in Victoria, British Columbia, Pierce was converted to Christianity by the Methodist missionary the Rev. Thomas Crosby and later served as his interpreter when Crosby was assigned to Port Simpson. This led to Pierce's own career as a missionary. First informally and then formally after his ordination in 1886, Pierce worked to convert Natives and suppress indigenous customs (like the potlatch and secret societies) in B.C. coastal villages such as Alert Bay, Bella Bella, Port Essington, Greenville, and Klemtu, and even Wrangell, Alaska. Pierce was missionary at Kispiox for fifteen years starting in 1895, and in 1910 was transferred to Port Essington, where he served until his retirement in 1933. Thereafter he lived in Prince Rupert, B.C. In 1876 Crosby married Pierce to a Haida woman named Emma Leusate. In 1890 he married again, to Margaret Hargraves, an Englishwoman who was a teacher at the Methodist mission school in Port Essington. His book, From Potlatch to Pulpit, published in 1933, contains memoirs of his life and conversion as well as substantial information about traditional Tsimshian customs, beliefs, and seasonal round.

When an attacker lobbed the Hamburger SV goalie, Jakobs lunged feet-first into his goal and scraped the ball off the line. However, he fell into the hooks fixing the goal to the ground (at that time, the hooks were not stipulated to be under the earth). He hung there for 20 agonising minutes, the hook deeply embedded in his flesh. Finally, the team doctor cut the hooks from his back with a scalpel. With this, the nerves in his back were cut.

Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at: http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=14774 on 2018-07-18 Shell description This superfamily of sea snails have adult shells which do not look like typical gastropod shells because the spire of the shell is not visible in adults, instead the shells are: often quite rounded in shape, varying from globular to elongate, and with a long, very narrow, aperture which is sometimes toothed. The snails in these families have no operculum. The shells of almost every species in this superfamily are very smooth and shiny, and this is because in the living animal, the shell is nearly always fully covered with the mantle. The largest known fossil cowry was Gisortia gigantiea Munster, 1828 which reached a length of 350mm. The largest modern cowry is the Atlantic Deer Cowry (Macrocypraea cervus) at up to 190mm. The largest known cowry from any extant subfamily or genus was the Australian cowry Zoila (Gigantocypraea) gigas (McCoy, 1867) at about 247mm. Nomenclature This superfamily used to be known as Cypraeacea. Prior to the recent ruling by the ICZN, many invertebrate superfamily names ended in the suffix -acea, or -aceae, not -oidea as now required according to ICZN article 29.2. The suffix -oidea used to be used for some subclasses and superorders, where it is still found. In much of the older literature including Keen 1958, gastropod superfamilies are written with the suffix -acea.Keen A. M. (1958). Sea Shells of Tropical West America.

Little is known of his early life in Lax Kw'alaams (a.k.a. Port Simpson), B.C. He was probably the son of Arthur Wellington Clah, an hereditary chief and prominent early Christian convert who had taught the Tsimshian language to the Anglican lay missionary William Duncan in the 1850s. In 1903 Boas wrote to Clah, on the recommendation of his Tlingit-Kwakwaka'wakw informant George Hunt, expressing an interest in finding someone with whom to work on a description of Tsimshian culture. Clah turned the correspondence over to Tate, and Tate began to send Boas information, especially transcribed oral narratives, through the mail. It seems certain that Boas and Tate never met face to face. The result was Boas's long 1916 monograph Tsimshian Mythology. When that volume appeared, Boas wrote in its preface that \\"Mr. Tate died in April 1914.\\" One of the few insights into Tate's life in Tsimshian Mythology comes in a discussion of clan-to-clan adoption, citing Tate's adoption from the Laxsgiik (Eagle clan) into the Gispwudwada (Killerwhale clan) of the Gispaxlo'ots tribe by his maternal grandfather, and his subsequent adoption of his own daughter into the Gispwudwada as well. Boas and Tate's correspondence is housed at the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia. It includes complaints by Boas that Tate is resisting his instructions by writing the stories in English first, and then translating into his own Tsimshian, instead of transcribing his informants' Tsimshian first. In the 1930s, Tate's widow, now known as \\"Mrs. Sam Bennett,\\" of the Gits'iis tribe, served as a key informant to the anthropologist Viola Garfield during her fieldwork in Lax Kw'alaams. Aspersions were cast on the reliability or thoroughness of Tate's work by a 1917 review of Tsimshian Mythology written by Marius Barbeau, who had by then done much more extensive, face-to-face fieldwork in Lax Kw'alaams with Clah's grandson, William Beynon. The literary historian Ralph Maud has written at length on the complicated give-and-take which resulted in the publication of Tate's stories and the possible cultural distortions that resulted. Maud has also produced a volume which reformats Tate's stories to bring out the poetry in his English. Bibliography * Barbeau, Marius (1917) Review of Tsimshian Mythology by Franz Boas.

These are marine gastropod mollusks in the superfamily Cypraeoidea, the cowries and cowry allies. http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=23022 Shell description Cypraeidae have adult shells which are very rounded, almost like an egg; they do not look like a typical gastropod shell. In virtually all of the species in the family Cypraeidae, the shells are extremely smooth and shiny. This is because in the living animal, the shell is nearly always fully covered with the mantle. Typically, no spire is visible in the fully adult shell, and there is a long, narrow, aperture which is lined with \\"teeth.\\" Juvenile cowry shells are not at all similar to adult cowry shells. The juvenile shells of cowries perhaps more closely resemble the shells of some \\"bubble snails\\" in the order Cephalaspidea. Also the shells of juvenile cowries seldom exhibit the same color patterns as the adult shells do, and thus can be hard to identify to species. Cowries have no operculum. Predators and prey The very narrow toothed aperture of the cowry shell makes the adult shells difficult for many predators to reach into. However cowries are still vulnerable to predation: * Some tropical crustaceans can break the dorsum of a cowry shell. * Some mollusc-eating cones, such as Conus textile, can inject venom into the cowry's flesh. The cone then extends its stomach into the shell, through the aperture, to completely ingest the flesh. * Some octopuses can gouge a small hole (using a special barb/tooth and an acidic secretion) through the shell to inject a venom that kills the animal within. The eating habits of cowries are poorly known, because most species are nocturnal and cryptic, but sponges are the most commonly described prey. Off the coasts of Australia, common cowry species eat sponges, and on Caribbean coral reefs they are known to eat sponges that are otherwise chemically defended against other predators.

It is a remake of Les Fugitifs, a 1986 French comedy starring Gérard Depardieu and Pierre Richard also directed by Veber. The movie was popular at the box office, grossing more than $40.6 million against a budget of $15 million, despite receiving a general negative reception from critics.  Plot  Lucas has been in prison for armed robbery. On the day he is released, he gets taken hostage by Ned Perry, an incompetent, novice criminal who robs a bank (to get money for treatment for his ill daughter, Meg) at the moment Lucas just happens to be there. Detective Dugan assumes they must be in it together and sets about tracking them down. Several chases, an accidental shooting, treatment from a crazy vet who thinks Lucas is a dog and other capers follow, all the while Lucas trying to ditch his idiotic companion and prove his own innocence. Whilst avoiding the law, the two form an unlikely partnership to help cure the silent Meg and make good their escape. They rescue Meg from the care home she's in (with Perry nearly ruining the whole affair with his clumsiness) and flee for Canada, pretending to be a married couple with a son. Perry later enters a Canadian bank to change some currency only to find himself taken hostage by a different bank robber in the same manner he originally kidnapped Lucas. Because of this unexpected development, Lucas does not need to say goodbye to Meg, with whom he has formed a bond.

During process mining, specialized data mining algorithms are applied to event log data in order to identify trends, patterns and details contained in event logs recorded by an information system. Process mining aims to improve process efficiency and understanding of processes. Process mining is also known as Automated Business Process Discovery (ABPD).Gartner Definition. However, in academic literature the term Automated Business Process Discovery is used in a narrower sense to refer specifically to techniques that take as input an event log and produce as output a business process model. The term Process Mining is used in a broader setting to refer not only to techniques for discovering process models, but also techniques for business process conformance and performance analysis based on event logs. Overview Process mining techniques are often used when no formal description of the process can be obtained by other approaches, or when the quality of existing documentation is questionable. Per Gartner, Process Mining is a subset of hyperautomation. For example, application of process mining methodology to the audit trails of a workflow management system, the transaction logs of an enterprise resource planning system, or the electronic patient records in a hospital can result in models describing processes, organizations, and products.Kirchmer, M., Laengle, S., & Masias, V. (2013). Transparency-Driven Business Process Management in Healthcare Settings [Leading Edge]. Technology and Society Magazine, IEEE, 32(4), 14-16. Event log analysis can also be used to compare event logs with prior model(s) to understand whether the observations conform to a prescriptive or descriptive model. It is required that the event logs data be linked to a case ID, activities, and timestampsLuis M. Camarinha- Matos, Frederick Benaben, Willy Picard (2015).

Contemporary management trends such as BAM (Business Activity Monitoring), BOM (Business Operations Management), and BPI (business process intelligence) illustrate the interest in supporting diagnosis functionality in the context of Business Process Management technology (e.g., Workflow Management Systems and other process-aware information systems). Application Process mining follows the options established in business process engineering, then goes beyond those options by providing feedback for business process modeling:Process Mining: Discovery, Conformance and Enhancement of Business Processes, Springer Verlag, Berlin (). * process analysis filters, orders and compresses logfiles for further insight into the connex of process operations. * process design may be supported by feedback from process monitoring (action or event recording or logging) * process enactment uses results from process mining based on logging for triggering further process operations A database of applications of Process Mining list all the major process mining initiatives. Classification There are three classes of process mining techniques. This classification is based on whether there is a prior model and, if so, how the prior model is used during process mining. * Discovery: Previous (a priori) models do not exist. Based on an event log, a new model is constructed or discovered based on low-level events. For example, using the alpha algorithm (a didactically driven approach).Aalst, W. van der, Weijters, A., & Maruster, L. (2004). Workflow Mining: Discovering Process Models from Event Logs. IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 16 (9), 1128–1142. Many established techniques exist for automatically constructing process models (for example, Petri net, pi-calculusΠ-calculus expression) based on an event log.Agrawal, R., Gunopulos, D., & Leymann, F. (1998). Mining Process Models from Workflow Logs. In Sixth international conference on extending database technology (pp. 469–483).Cook, J., & Wolf, A. (1998).

Rediscovering Workflow Models from Event-Based Data using Little Thumb. Integrated Computer-Aided Engineering, 10 (2), 151–162. Recently, process mining research has started targeting the other perspectives (e.g., data, resources, time, etc.). One example is the technique described in (Aalst, Reijers, & Song, 2005),Aalst, W. van der, Beer, H., & Dongen, B. van (2005). Process Mining and Verification of Properties: An Approach based on Temporal Logic. In R. Meersman & Z. T. et al.

Springer-Verlag, Berlin. which can be used to construct a social network. * Conformance checking: Used when there is an a priori model. The existing model is compared with the process event log; discrepancies between the log and the model are analyzed. For example, there may be a process model indicating that purchase orders of more than 1 million Euro require two checks. Another example is the checking of the so-called \\"four-eyes\\" principle. Conformance checking may be used to detect deviations to enrich the model. An example is the extension of a process model with performance data, i.e., some a priori process model is used to project the potential bottlenecks. Another example is the decision miner described in (Rozinat & Aalst, 2006b)Rozinat, A., & Aalst, W. van der (2006a). Conformance Testing: Measuring the Fit and Appropriateness of Event Logs and Process Models. In C. Bussler et al. (Ed.), BPM 2005 Workshops (Workshop on Business Process Intelligence) (Vol. 3812, pp. 163–176). Springer-Verlag, Berlin. which takes an a priori process model and analyzes every choice in the process model. For each choice the event log is consulted to see which information is typically available the moment the choice is made. Then classical data mining techniques are used to see which data elements influence the choice. As a result, a decision tree is generated for each choice in the process. * Performance Mining: Used when there is an a priori model. The model is extended with a new performance information such as processing times, cycle times, waiting times, costs, etc., so that the goal is not to check conformance, but rather to improve the performance of the existing model with respect to certain process performance measures. An example is the extension of a process model with performance data, i.e., some prior process model dynamically annotated with performance data.

The frame is made of polymer with an aluminium insert, and the slide and barrel are steel. It is the lightest production .380 ACP pistol in the world, weighing only 0.24 g empty, and is roughly the same size as many .22 Long Rifle and .25 ACP pistols. Design details The P-3AT standard cartridge capacity is 6+1,https://www.keltecweapons.com/product/p3at-36-6-rnd-standard-magazine/ and Kel-Tec also makes extended 7+1-https://www.keltecweapons.com/product/p3at-313-one-round-magazine- extension/ and 9+1-roundhttps://www.keltecweapons.com/product/p3at-37-9rnd- magazine/ magazines for it. Trigger pull is 22 N. These attributes have made it popular for civilians with concealed carry permits and with police officers as a back-up or off-duty pistol. The P-3AT lacks a slide stop. It was omitted to keep the size similar to the P-32. The similar size and weight of the P-3AT resulted in increased felt recoil over the P-32 due to the more powerful .380 ACP cartridge (the P-32 used the smaller .32 ACP cartridge). The Kel-Tec P-3AT is available with blued, parkerised, or matte chrome slide. The polymer frame is available in black, grey, navy blue, or olive drab green solid colours, as well as 'Urban Blue/Grey' and 'True Timber' camouflage. Current production is the second generation model, with improvements over the first generation. The most easily distinguished difference between generations is the extractor. The first generation has a traditional external extractor parallel to the side of the gun, while the second generation has a button-head hex screw to the rear of the extractor, which is at an angle to the side of the gun.

Versions of the tale were later retold by Ruth Manning-Sanders in A Book of Dragons (1965) and A Choice of Magic (1971), and by Christopher Rawson in The Usborne Book of Dragons (1979). Synopsis Illustration from Andrew Lang's Fairy Books Stan Bolovan's wife was sad, though they were prosperous. Finally, she confessed that she was grieved that they had no children. Stan visited a wise man and begged him for children, and ignored his warnings about feeding them all. He returned to find his wife delighted: they had a hundred children. Soon, they found they could not feed them all, and Stan set out to find food. He found a flock of sheep and hoped to steal some, but a dragon stole animals and milk from the flock. He asked, and the shepherds promised him a third of the flock if he rid them of the dragon. He met up with the dragon and said he ate rocks by night and flowers by day and would fight. He set a contest: he squeezed buttermilk from cheese, and the dragon tried to squeeze it from a rock, and had to own he was better. The dragon offered him service with his mother, who would pay him sacks of ducats. The mother set them two trials: her son threw a staff as far as he could, and then it was Stan's turn. First, he told the dragon he was afraid that he would kill him with the force; then he claimed to be waiting until the moon got out of the way. The mother then sent them to fetch water, and Stan could not have carried the skins she sent, but when he said it was too much bother and threatened to carry the stream instead, the dragon carried them for him. The mother then sent them to gather wood, and Stan started to tie trees together, declaring he would carry back the entire wood, and the dragon brought back wood for him, before he uprooted the forest. The mother told her son to crack open his head in the night. Stan hid under a pig's trough and was not harmed. They gave him gold to go away, which he could not carry, but he said he wanted to stay in her service, because his friends would be ashamed of him, to carry so little; they urged him to go, and he went on the condition that the dragon carry back the gold for him. He did not want to go all the way home with the dragon, so that it would not know where he lived, but his hungry children came running, and were so hungry they shouted for the dragon's flesh. Terrified, the dragon dropped the gold and ran away, leaving Stan and his family to prosper with it.

Currently The industry around enotourism has grown significantly throughout the first decade of the 21st century. In the United States 27 million travelers, or 17% of American leisure travelers, engaged in culinary or wine-related activities.

Activities Cycling through vineyards in Mendoza, Argentina Most visits to the wineries take place at or near the site where the wine is produced. Visitors typically learn the history of the winery, see how the wine is made, and then taste the wines. At some wineries, staying in a small guest house at the winery is also offered.

Meanwhile, Parvati's father arranges her marriage to a much older man. Though she loves Devdas, she obeys her father to suffer in silence like a dutiful Indian wife of those times. Devdas as a result takes to drinking. Chandramukhi (Rajkumari), a dancing girl or \\"prostitute\\" he has befriended in Calcutta, falls for him and gives up her profession to try to save him. Parvati, hearing of his decline, comes to see him to steer him away from a life of drinking. Devdas sends her back, saying in his hour of final need he will come to her. She returns to her life of duty. Realising his end is near, Devdas decides to keep his promise and meet Parvati. He journeys all night, reaches her house and is found dead outside the high walls of her house. Inside Parvati hears from her stepson Mohan, that Devdas is dead. Grief-stricken at this news, Parvati attempts to run out of her house, in order to pay a last visit to his beloved. But her husband orders the main gate to be closed, as it was a social taboo at that time, not to let women step out of the periphery of their in- laws'residence. Consequently, Paro fails to run out, trips over, and the main gate is shut in front of her. A dead Devdas is taken to the cemetery and cremated by the local people. Cast ;Male * Saigal as Devdas * A.

He played college football for the Virginia Cavaliers and was recognized as a consensus All-American. He later returned to Virginia as an assistant coach under Mike London. Moore was named Director of Community Relations for the College Football Playoff in March 2014. College career At the University of Virginia, Moore started at quarterback for the Cavaliers in 1988, as a redshirt sophomore; his college jersey number was \\"12.\\" Moore led the 1988 team to a 7-4 win-loss record. In 1989, he and the Cavaliers went 10-2 for the regular season, winning a share of the ACC championship. Moore demonstrated the ability not only to throw accurately on both the long and short pass, he had the ability to run the ball effectively. The Cavaliers only losses of the 1989 regular season were to the previous season's NCAA champion, Notre Dame, in the Kickoff Classic, and to Clemson in a game where Moore was injured and never played a down. The Cavaliers shared the ACC title with Duke, despite beating the Blue Devils 49-28, because the ACC had no tie-breaking system at the time. The Citrus Bowl, traditional host of the ACC champion, selected Virginia anyway, pitting the Cavaliers against the University of Illinois and future NFL quarterback Jeff George. The Cavaliers lost 31-21, but Moore was later quoted as saying \\"I think we knew (we had something special) my junior year, that 1989 season, after we won our first ACC championship. It was a team of veteran players. My class was about 23 strong. Everyone played as a redshirt freshman. We had a lot of playing experience. By the time we were fourth-year juniors, we had a lot of games under our belt. We knew going into that fifth year that we could probably be special.\\" Moore finished the 1989 season ranked fourth in the NCAA in passing efficiency. 1990 season In the 1990 season, Moore and the Cavaliers started off with seven straight wins, including a groundbreaking 20-7 win over the Clemson Tigers, a team that Virginia had not beaten in its previous twenty-nine matches. The offense was prolific, scoring a combined 337 points in its first seven wins, and Moore had a direct hand in scoring more than 50% of the team's touchdowns. For the last three weeks of the seven game streak, the Virginia Cavaliers were ranked #1 in both major polls. Moore relied on two main targets for his passing game: wide receiver Herman Moore, no relation to Shawn, and tight end Bruce McGonnigal. Despite Herman Moore's reputation as the most dangerous receiver on the field, McGonnigal was known for making clutch catches for first downs. However, in the week before the Georgia Tech game, McGonnigal ruptured his spleen, and a vital part of the passing game was suddenly missing. Georgia Tech prevailed 41-38, despite prolific passing numbers from Moore, including a 63-yard touchdown pass to Herman Moore. Stealing the Cavaliers' momentum, Georgia Tech went on to an undefeated season, a Citrus Bowl win over the Nebraska Cornhuskers, and a share of the national championship with the Colorado Buffaloes. Already invited to the Sugar Bowl, the Cavaliers attempted to make the best of the season, and managed a 24-10 win over the North Carolina Tar Heels, but against the Maryland, the Cavaliers found themselves in another struggle, with both teams alternating the lead. Late in the game, Moore ran the ball and was tackled short of the Maryland goal line. In the resulting turmoil, a Maryland defender stepped upon the thumb of Moore's throwing hand, forcing it backwards, and dislocating (referred to as a \\"bad flipper\\") it for the rest of the season. Without Shawn Moore, the Virginia offense sputtered immediately, and Maryland took the win. The following week, Virginia Tech picked apart Virginia's inexperienced back-up quarterback, Matt Blundin, and the Cavaliers 7-0 start ended in an 8-3 showing. Moore was brought back for the Sugar Bowl game against the #10 Tennessee Volunteers, and at first his presence kept Tennessee wary and prevented them from stacking the line. Virginia running backs Terry Kirby and Nikki Fisher ran for over 100 yards and Virginia led 16-0 at halftime. But with a few errant long passes in the first half revealing that Moore was not the threat he had been most of the season, Tennessee tightened its defense in the second half, and battled back to win 23-22. In that 1990 season, Shawn Moore passed for 2262 yards and 21 touchdowns, and rushed for 306 yards and 8 touchdowns. Despite missing the last game of the regular season, Moore still led the NCAA in passing efficiency, even over eventual Heisman Trophy winner, Ty Detmer. He had broken nearly every major record for a quarterback at Virginia. Moore was voted fourth in Heisman balloting, at the time receiving more Heisman votes than any other ACC candidate had previously. His favorite receiver, Herman Moore, placed sixth in the balloting. Professional career Moore was drafted in the eleventh round of the 1991 NFL Draft by the Denver Broncos. Moore managed to share time at the starting position with Tommy Maddox when John Elway was out for the last six games of the 1992 season. In between seasons with the Broncos he played for the Birmingham Fire of the World League of American Football. After serving as an NFL back-up from 1991 to 1994 with Denver and later the Arizona Cardinals, Moore played for a number of CFL teams, including the Ottawa Rough Riders, Winnipeg Blue Bombers, and the Calgary Stampeders. Post-playing career After his career in pro football, Moore pursued administrative jobs with the NCAA, and a brief stint as an XFL scout. He also has worked for the NFL to promote youth football and coached high school football at St. Albans School in Washington, D.C. On January 8, 2010, it was announced that Moore would return to Virginia as an assistant coach for the Virginia Cavaliers football team.. Moore served as an assistant coach at Virginia until 2012. In March 2014, Moore was named Director of Community Relations for the College Football Playoff.

Life and career Born in Prague, Bohemia, he was a member of the Tyrolean Thun und Hohenstein noble family, elevated to the rank of Imperial Counts (Reichsgrafen) in 1629. His elder half-brother Guidobald was Archbishop of Salzburg from 1654 to 1668. Johann Ernst von Thun was ordained a priest in 1677. He was elected Bishop of Seckau in Styria on 29 December 1679 and consecrated by the Salzburg archbishop Max Gandolf von Kuenburg the next year. Thun succeeded Kuenburg by election on 30 June 1687, obtaining the prince-archiepiscopal dignities. Coat of arms The archbishop is best remembered as patron of the architect Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach, a leading proponent of Austrian Baroque church architecture. Thun had his Salzburg residence lavishly rebuilt, including the Collegiate Church, the Holy Trinity Church, and Schloss Klessheim. Throughout his reign, however, he displayed a marked antipathy to the Italian designers and tastemakers that were emulated by many German monarchs at the time. Upon his accession, he halted work on a church being built for the Italian Theatine order and denied payment to Italian craftsmen, resulting in longstanding court proceedings. Thun, backed by Pope Innocent XII, prevailed in lengthy quarrels with the Salzburg cathedral chapter as well as with the neighbouring Bishops of Chiemsee and Passau. In 1697, he obliged all graduates of Salzburg's university to swear belief in the Immaculate Conception. He remained a harsh persecutor of Crypto-protestantism in his Salzburg lands; these measures were later once again intensified under his successor Leopold Anton von Firmian. On the other hand, Thun supported the leading members of the Braunau Parliament during the Bavarian uprising of 1705–06 against the occupying forces of the Habsburg emperor Joseph I. Archbishop von Thun was buried in Salzburg Cathedral. By his will, he had his brain deposited in the university chapel, his entrails (symbolizing compassion) deposited in his hospital church, and his heart interred at his favorite Holy Trinity Church.Blunt, Anthony, editor: \\"Baroque and Rococo Architecture and Decoration.\\", Grafton Books, 1978 References External links *Entry on Aeiou Encyclopedia 17th- century Austrian people 17th-century Roman Catholic archbishops 18th-century Roman Catholic archbishops Roman Catholic archbishops of Salzburg Archbishops of Salzburg Counts of Austria Johann Ernst People from Graz 1643 births 1709 deaths ","title":"Johann Ernst von Thun und Hohenstein"},{"id":"6465455","text":"Jeffrey Harris Lichtman (born June 5, 1965) is a New York-based criminal defense lawyer.

The moshava was the first modern Jewish community in the Hula Valley. Built in 1883, the community was among a series of agricultural settlements founded during the First Aliyah.Dubrovin Jewish Agency In it had a population of . Etymology The name of the village was taken from a sentence in the Bible: \\"He (Ezra) determined to go up.\\" (Ezra 7:9), which was connected to the Zionist Aliyah. Geography In the late 19th century, the Hulah Valley was mostly swampland and the 15,000 acre (61 km²) shallow Lake Hula. The region was a well-known breeding ground for mosquitoes, and as a result concerns about malaria restricted further Jewish settlement in the region for fifty years. As drainage technology and pesticide use increased in the 1920s, settlement in the area became more feasible. After the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and the establishment of the state of Israel, the swamp was drained and converted into agricultural land. Recognizing the unique ecosystem of the valley and its importance as a stopover for migrating birds, scientists lobbied for a small portion of the swamp to remain as a nature reserve. In 1964, the 800 acre (3.2 km²) Hula Valley Nature Reserve, the country's first, was opened. History Yesud HaMa'ala synagogue Yesud Hama’Ala: First house 1911 Yesud Hama’Ala 1937 Christian Zionist Laurence Oliphant donated 1,000 roubles to the founding settlers of Yesud Hama’Ala. A census conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities, recorded a population of 142 Jews. With the activation of the National Water Carrier in 1964, Syrian efforts to disrupt drainage patterns into the Sea of Galilee were accompanied by attacks against Israeli farming and fishing activities in the region. Three years later, Syrian forces were repelled further from Yesud HaMa'ala with the capture of the Golan Heights during the 1967 Six-Day War. On 22 July 2006, a series of Katyusha attacks by Hezbollah struck communities in the Hulah Valley during the course of the 2006 Lebanon War. In Yesud HaMa’ala, one person was lightly wounded from rocket shrapnel. Prior to the bombings, the community had not seen any hostile attacks since the Six-Day War in 1967. On 29 July three rockets hit Yesud HaMa'ala, lightly wounding a woman and damaging property. Landmarks Yesud Hama'ala commemorative stamp Yesud HaMa'ala is home to the Dubrovin Farm, a museum commemorating the founders of the community, containing personal possessions and furniture from 19th century Russia. Part of the museum includes ruins of a synagogue dating between the 4th and 6th centuries, highlighting the historic Jewish claim to the region. Tel Hazor is very close, even closer than to Hatzor HaGlilit which is named after it (when Yesud HaMa'ala was founded the Tel was not excavated yet).

The car debuted as the Simca Vedette in 1954 in France and Belgium, but in some export markets where the Simca brand had little history, it was badged as a Ford, despite the French business having been sold by Ford to Simca in 1954. The Ford Vedette is a large car formerly manufactured by Ford SAF in their Poissy plant from 1948-1954. Originally conceived by Edsel Ford and Ford designer Eugene T. \\"Bob\\" Gregorie as a “light” Ford model, smaller than the 1942 Ford. However, Edsel Ford died in 1943, and following the war Ford corporate felt the light car project would pull sales from the full size Ford. Additionally, Henry Ford II felt that Gregorie’s planned 1949 Ford, which shared the same character lines as the Light Ford, was too large for its market, as was Gregorie’s proposed 1949 Mercury. To that end, the planned Ford and Mercury lines were pushed to Mercury and Lincoln, and a contest held to design a Ford that would at once smaller than the Mercury, but larger than the Light Ford. To recoup the cost of Light Ford, that car was transferred to Ford France. Introduced at the 1948 Mondial de l'Automobile in Paris, it was designed entirely in Detroit (resembling contemporary Mercury models) and featured the Poissy-made 2158 cc Aquillon sidevalve V8 engine of Ford's Flathead engine family, the same as in pre-war Matford cars. It was the only French car of its time with a V8 engine. First years of production Because the Poissy factory could not resume complete automobile production immediately after World War II, many vital components had still to be made by various subcontractors, which reportedly had an adverse effect on the quality of the car and contributed to its limited popularity. Over the six years in production, the Vedette was available in several body styles, ranging from the original four-door fastback (with rear suicide doors) through the later four-door saloon, a Sunliner two-door landaulet based on the saloon (with a roll-down roof over the entire cabin), a two-door Coupé and, based on it, the Cabriolet Décapotable (a two-door convertible). 1950s updates Under the direction of the new company president, François Lehideux, Ford France refreshed the car for 1950, and again in 1952, when it finally received a one-piece windscreen, new interior and bumpers, better brakes, lengthened rear overhang and trunk - and a cigarette lighter. The 1953 October Mondial de l'Automobile also saw a luxury version of the Vedette, the Ford Vendôme, fitted with the bigger 3923 cc Mistral V8 engine, previously used in Ford France trucks. Also updated in 1953 was the five-door, five-seat Abeille (French for \\"bee\\") estate with a two- piece tailgate, advertised as both practical (with a payload of ) and comfortable. The Abeille, originally exhibited with little fanfare at the October 1951 Motor Show as a \\"farmer's car\\" (voiture agricole) and launched more formally as the \\"Ford Abeille\\" in June 1952, was a \\"no frills\\" development of the Vedette with which it shared its wheel base and engine, but the rear overhang and therefore the overall length were shorter by The interior surfaces of the Abeille were almost without exception of painted metal, and the front bench seat of the Vedette was replaced with two \\"rustic\\" seats apparently taken from a commercial van, but behind them the rear bench was easy to remove, allowing for the installation of a flat \\"false-floor\\" of timber planks, and facilitating the use of the car as a load carrier for farmers and small-scale traders. At the October 1953 Motor Show the standard Abeille was listed at 845,000 francs as against 935,000 francs for the least expensive version of the Vedette.http://dvole.free.fr/fordsaf/a52.htm Sale of the Poissy factory Facing unsatisfactory sales results, as well as disruptive strikes at the Poissy plant at the turn of the decade, Ford had been trying to dispose of the factory since shortly after the end of the war. An opportunity arose in 1954, when Henri-Theodore Pigozzi, the founder of the increasingly successful French automaker Simca, was looking for a new plant to expand its operations. Ford France was merged into Simca with both the Poissy plant and the rights to all models manufactured there — including a newly designed Vedette. The new car had debuted in France under the name of Simca Vedette, but was sold as the Ford Vedette in some markets (including Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany) at least until 1956.

The name Laxgibuu derives from gibuu, which means wolf in the Gitxsan and Nisga'a languages. In Tsimshian the word is gibaaw (gyibaaw or gyibaw), but Tsimshians still use the word Laxgibuu for Wolf clan. The chief crest of the Laxgibuu is the Wolf.

Some Laxgibuu house-groups are related to Wolf clan groups among the Tahltan and Tlingit First Nations to the north. In the case of the Tlingit, the connection is through Tlingit Wolves who migrated south from what is now Alaska to escape inter-clan warfare and settled among the Tsimshian, Gitxsan, and Nisga'a.

It is on the First Unitarian Church of Portland property and attached to the church's building. It is a block away from their main clinic. Outside In is a medical and youth service nonprofit organization in Portland, Oregon which provides primary care and \\"wraparound services\\" for low income and homeless clients. It also has several other programs such as needle exchange program for drug addicts, and eligibility restricted tattoo removal service. The needle exchange has been the cause of community objection as well as cancellation of insurance policy and donors declining to give. It has reported that in fiscal year 2015-2016, it has given out 988,399 needles which was 20,962 more needles than what was returned. Founded in 1968 to serve youth, the organization has since continued to revise its services to meet the needs of its clients. Its services as described in October 2014 include medical care, mobile medical vans, tattoo removal, housing, education, counseling, and job training. History Outside In was founded in June 1968 by Dr. Charles Spray, Arnold Goldberg, and Mary Lu Zurcher as one of the first free community health clinics in the U.S. and one of the earliest on the West Coast, along with the Haight Ashbury Free Clinics and the Los Angeles Free Clinic. The organization was founded to serve Portland's \\"alienated youth\\", some of whom had substance abuse problems and most of whom had mental health issues. It initially rented its Downtown Portland space from the First Unitarian Church of Portland. Spray helped found the organization after learning that the Unitarian church's youth coffeehouse space, Charix, was in danger of being shut down by the city and a group that had successfully shut down the Crystal Ballroom music venue because of its association with the 1960s drug culture. It was told by its insurance carrier that all of the organization's policies would be cancelled if they were to start a needle exchange. It took the clinic a few years to find a replacement insurance carrier. In September 2002, Portland Business Journal reported some prospective donors refuse to donate to Outside In, because of its needle exchange program. Some of the group's early work involved staffing a 24-hour crisis hotline that was later spun off to form the Metro Crisis Intervention Service. In November 2017, two staff members were stabbed on the job; as a result, in May 2018 the workers of Outside In voted to unionize, with Oregon AFSCME as their parent union. In April 2019, it has announced that it is expanding to add a second location in Gresham near NE 162nd and Burnside which will open Spring of 2020 for transients and low income people. According to its development director, Outside In helps \\"unique populations that are not well-served in other health care settings,\\". Willamette Week reported in April 2019 that Outside In employees are members of AFSCME along with a handful of other private nonprofits heavily funded by government contracts. A second clinic location focused on families in need opened in Rockwood, Gresham, Oregon in September 2020 Services Outside In is a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) and a licensed mental health agency. Outside In operates a needle exchange for drug addicts. The syringe exchange, implemented in 1989, was the first one to be developed and the third to go into operation in the country. The needle exchange program has been operating a fentanyl testing service on street drugs for about two years where subjects bring samples of their illegal drugs or drug residues from paraphernalia as told to Oregon Public Broadcasting. The article said drug possession remains strictly illegal. In 2013–2014, the organization self reported it served 966 youth with mental health care, drug and alcohol treatment, employment, education, job training, and housing. Outside In's medical clinic was the medical home for 5,384 people in 2014. The same year, the group's syringe exchange served 4,322 people. The organization's tattoo removal service is a restricted eligibility service offered at an off-site location at 1719 W Burnside St. Access is restricted to applicants with an income not exceeding 200% federal poverty guideline. Injection kit given out by the Outside In IDU Health Services to drug addicts  Community Objection  The needle exchange program offered through Outside In and Multnomah County was the subject of a grievance by the adjacent neighborhood Goose Hollow Foothills League due to concerns that needles handed out by Outside In are littered in Goose Hollow by its drug addict clients. The neighborhood association sent a letter on the matter of needles and other supplies given out by Outside In to a Multnomah County Commissioner Sharon Meieran in February 2018. This letter was published in part in Portland Tribune > \\"We are drowning in the needles put out into the community by Multnomah > County,\\" said a letter complaining about the health department program that > was sent to Commissioner Sharon Meieran by the Goose Hollow Foothills League > last month. \\"Our residents are picking up hundreds of needles each week,\\" > the letter states. \\"Our neighborhood has experienced a shocking increase in > unsafe and unsanitary levels of needles since MCHD started this program ... > while keeping drug addicts safer, MCHD is risking the health of thousands > more with this program. \\"Our neighborhood is also filled with bloody cotton > balls and feces-covered wipes that were given out at Outside In,\\" added the > letter, which was signed by Tracy Prince, the league's vice chair. \\"It is > humane and necessary to hand out these items, but MCHD should put a plan in > place so that these items aren't disposed of in our neighborhoods.\\" In May 2019, a Portland activist Brandon Farley who believes the needle exchange add to a city's addiction and homelessness problems dumped out syringe caps and dirty syringes on the sidewalk in front of the Outside In's needle exchange in what he calls as an \\"act of civil disobedience\\". Age restricted services  Some of the services offered are eligibility restricted to clients 16–24 years of age. = Job training = \\"Bespoke\\" is bicycle-powered smoothie cart set up in Portland's O'Bryant Square that gives homeless youth on-the-job training. In 2005 the organization set up Virginia Woof, a non-profit dog daycare centre to provide training and employment for their clients. It operates in two locations. Auxiliary services In addition to the fixed location clinic, Outside In's medical clinic operates two medical outreach vans and a school-based health center at Milwaukie High School.

Each of the experts compiled a list of what they considered to be the top 100 Thoroughbred racehorses of the 20th century, which was then combined into a master list. The list was expanded into a book with complete biographies. All the horses on the list raced in the United States, though several such as Phar Lap, Northern Dancer, Dahlia and Miesque began their careers in another country. Ruffian was the top-ranked filly. The small body of voters meant that any individual ballot had the potential to disproportionately influence the final tally, which ended up coming to pass. At the time of the list's unveiling, Blood-Horse managing editor Evan Hammonds spoke to the Associated Press. Hammonds revealed that Secretariat and Man o' War had both received three of the seven first-place votes. (Citation received the other first-place vote.) Man o' War was listed in first, second or third place on all seven ballots; six of the voters gave the same placement to Secretariat. However, Hammonds noted, a single voter left Secretariat out of that person's top 10 \\"because he got beat a few times\\". The result was that Secretariat became second, rather than first, in the aggregated final list. Blood-Horse promotes its top two selections as a ranking that \\"will generate debate for years to come\\". After the results became available, panel-member William Nack criticized the voting process as \\"skewered\\" because one of the seven voters had ranked Secretariat 14th, thus costing him the top slot. \\"That's an outrage,\\" Nack told the New York Daily News. \\"You mean this one person thought Secretariat would finish last in a 14-horse race?\\" The electoral friction was reflected in the introduction to the Top 100 Racehorses book produced by Blood-Horse, which conceded, \\"For all the work and dreaming that went into it... one approaches the list... with a nagging sense of its folly as a rational exercise and of the maddening arbitrariness of its outcome.\\" A total of 192 horses received at least one vote for inclusion in the list. Also in 1999, the Associated Press asked a panel of six voters a similar question; four chose Man o' War as best, one named Secretariat, and the sixth picked Tom Fool, which finished 11th on the Blood-Horse list. Additionally in 1992, Sports Illustrated conducted a poll of a panel of seven experts: (Joe Hirsch, executive columnist, Daily Racing Form; Woody Stephens, thoroughbred trainer for more than 50 years; Jim McKay, broadcaster, ABC Sports; Jim Bolus, secretary-treasurer, National Turf Writers Association; Frank E. Kilroe, retired California racing official; Tommy Trotter, Arlington International Racecourse steward; and William F. Reed, turf writer for 28 years) with Man o' War also voted No. 1 greatest horse (with Secretariat No. 2) in racing history.

ICAB had 39 dioceses in Brazil and sister churches in several countries.Notes from 19th National Council of ICAB, July 2007 It is the mother church of an international network called the Worldwide Communion of Catholic Apostolic Churches. The current President of the Episcopal Council of ICAB in Brazil is Josivaldo Pereira de Oliveira. History Costa was an outspoken critic of the regime of Brazilian president Getúlio Vargas (1930–1945) and of the Vatican's alleged relationship with fascist regimes. He also publicly criticized the dogma of papal infallibility and Catholic doctrines on divorce and clerical celibacy. As a result of his outspoken views, Duarte Costa resigned from his office of bishop of Botucatu in 1937 and was appointed to a titular see. In 1940 Cardinal Sebastião da Silveira Cintra, archbishop of Rio de Janeiro, permitted Costa, as titular bishop of Maura, to co-consecrate Bishop Eliseu Maria Coroli. Costa continued to criticize the government and the Catholic Church, advocating policies that were regarded by the authorities as Communist. In 1944 the Brazilian government imprisoned him, but later freed him under political pressure from the United States and Great Britain. In May 1945 Costa gave newspaper interviews accusing Brazil's Papal nuncio of Nazi- Fascist spying, and accused the Vatican of having aided and abetted Hitler. In addition, he announced plans to set up his own Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church, in which priests would be permitted to marry (and hold regular jobs in the lay world), and bishops would be elected by popular vote. On June 1945, Costa established the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church (ICAB).\\"Igreja Católica Apostólica Brasileira IICAB\\", Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements, (Peter Clarke, ed.), Routledge, 2004 Costa's act of schism resulted in his automatic excommunication from the Catholic Church. Later Costa was declared a ' – a person to be avoided by Catholics – and those Catholics who became adherents of ICAB were excommunicated also. According to Peter Anson, Costa was excommunicated \\"for attacks against the papacy,\\" In 1949, the Brazilian government temporarily suppressed all public worship by ICAB, because its liturgy and its clerical attire would result in confusion by being indistinguishable from those of the Catholic Church and were tantamount to deception of the public. However, a few months later ICAB churches were permitted to reopen, provided that their liturgy would not duplicate the Catholic liturgy, and their clergy would wear gray clerical attire in contrast to the black attire worn by Catholic clergy. Costa implemented reforms in ICAB of what he saw as problems in the Catholic Church. Clerical celibacy was abolished, though he himself never married and remained celibate. Rules for the reconciliation of divorced and remarried persons were implemented. The liturgy was translated into the vernacular, clergy were expected to live and work among the people and support themselves and their ministries by holding secular employment. Dom Luis Fernando Castillo Mendez, Patriarch of ICAB 1964-2009 Shortly after founding ICAB Costa consecrated four bishops, Salomão Barbosa Ferraz in 1945, Antidio Jose Vargas and Jorge Alves de Souza in 1946, and Luis Fernando Castillo Mendez in 1948. Costa, Ferraz, and Mendez attempted to establish similar autonomous National Catholic Apostolic Churches in several other Latin American countries. Costa was consecrator or co- consecrator of 11 additional bishops, each of whom took a leadership role in either ICAB or one of the other National Churches. Ferraz left ICAB in 1958. Ferraz reconciled with the Catholic Church in 1959 and his episcopal consecration was recognized as valid. However, Ferraz was excluded from church affairs such as the Roman Synod of 1960, even though he was present in Rome at the time, while the Vatican belatedly questioned the legitimacy of having recognized his status.Jarvis, Edward, God Land & Freedom, The True Story of ICAB, Apocryphile Press, Berkeley CA, 2018, pp. 130-132 Shortly thereafter, in 1961, Costa died and ICAB underwent several years of tumult as dissensions, schisms, and multiple claimants to the patriarchal throne threw the church into disarray. After this period, the church found stability and growth under Mendez, Costa's successor. Some sources seem to indicate that Mendez assumed leadership of ICAB upon Costa's death in 1961. Bishop Antidio Jose Vargas initially stepped in as General Supervisor, followed by Pedro dos Santos Silva as first president of the Episcopal Council, followed by the Italian-born Luigi Mascolo during the 1970's.Jarvis, Edward, God, Land & Freedom: The True Story of ICAB, Apocryphile Press, Berkeley CA, 2018, pp 140-141 By 1982 Castillo Mendez was elected president of the Episcopal Council, and was designated as Patriarch of ICAB in 1988 and as Patriarch of (ICAN) the international communion of similar churches in 1990. Beliefs and organization  ICAB accepts the Nicene, Athanasian, and Apostles' creeds and observes seven sacraments (baptism, Eucharist, confirmation, penance, unction, matrimony and ordination). The ICAB practices open communion for all Christians who acknowledge the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist. The church acknowledges divorce as a reality of life and permitted in Holy Scripture and will marry divorced persons after an ecclesiastical process of investigation and baptize the children of divorced.\\"Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church\\" at Enciclopédia TioSam (copied July 6, 2007) ICAB teaches that birth control is acceptable in certain circumstances (such as for disease prevention). It opposes abortion, euthanasia, capital punishment, and any other taking of human life. The church has three administrative branches, in line with the conception of a nation state: executive (episcopal council), legislative (national council), and judicial (superior ecclesiastical court).\\"The Pope who is not the Pope, but is Pope\\", Diário de Natal newspaper, April 9, 2006, p. 14 There are currently 52 bishops and 39 dioceses within Brazil. The official motto is Deus, Terra e Liberdade (\\"God, Land and Freedom\\"). ICAB is historically open to people of all faiths and philosophies, or none: Theosophists and Freemasons featured in early senior rolesJarvis, Edward, God, Land & Freedom: The True Story of ICAB, Apocryphile Press, Berkeley CA, 2018, pp. 69-70 as well as atheists and communists.Jarvis, Edward, God, Land & Freedom: The True Story of ICAB, Apocryphile Press, Berkeley CA, 2018, p. 82 According to Roger Bastide, \\"since 1945 its priests have been attending Umbanda spiritism séances, blessing statues of the Virgin identified with Yemanjá, saying mass in macumba sanctuaries\\".Bastide, Roger. The African Religions of Brazil, JHU Press, 2007 Apostolic succession ICAB holds that apostolic succession is maintained through the consecration of its bishops in an unbroken succession back to the Apostles. All ICAB bishops trace their apostolic succession back to Duarte Costa, a former bishop of the Roman Catholic Church. It is widely believed that ICAB's consecrations follow the Roman Catholic Tridentine rite in a vernacular version of the Pontifical, but this is not certain: ICAB's rites were altered on several occasions, and uniformity in practice has never been enforced anyway; furthermore, the Tridentine rite in an unauthorized vernacular form would no longer be considered the Tridentine rite according to Catholic theology.Jarvis, Edward, God, Land & Freedom: The True Story of ICAB, Apocryphile Press, Berkeley CA, 2018, pp 204-208 ICAB cites the unique case of Ferraz as evidence that its apostolic succession is valid, even by Roman Catholic standards. Just over a month after the church's foundation, in 1945, Duarte Costa consecrated Ferraz as bishop. Thirteen years later (in 1958 under Pope John XXIII) Ferraz reconciled with the Roman Catholic Church and was eventually recognized as a bishop, even though he was married at the time. Ferraz was not ordained or consecrated again, even conditionally; however he was initially held at arm's length by the Vatican while they examined his case, somewhat belatedly, and mooted the possibility of an affidavit to affirm that Ferraz, aged 80, and his Italian wife were chaste.Jarvis, Edward, God, Land & Freedom: The True Story of ICAB, Apocryphile Press, Berkeley CA, 2018, pp. 130-132 He did pastoral work in the Archdiocese of São Paulo until May 12, 1963, when he was appointed titular bishop of Eleutherna by Pope John XXIII. Ferraz participated in all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council, and Pope Paul VI appointed him to serve on one of Vatican II's working commissions. Upon his death in 1969, Ferraz was buried with full honors accorded a bishop of the Roman Catholic Church. Since then, however, the Vatican has repeatedly expressed reservations about ICAB's sacraments and does not recognize them; in 2012 Rome declared ICAB schismatic and reaffirmed its negation of ICAB's \\"illicit\\" orders. International communion Costa, Ferraz, and Mendez consecrated, or assisted in the consecrations, of dozens of bishops in various countries from the 1940s to the 1990s. Some bishops in the Costa line maintained formal ties with ICAB, but the majority appear to have gone their separate ways to found or participate in independent Catholic bodies without ties to ICAB. Such bishops have been declared doubtful at best by the new regime, citing the claim that a defect in proper intention exists in all bishops who have strayed from ICAB. Churches in full communion with ICAB are members of . There has been a fluctuating number of partner churches in and a current list of official members is not available. The last world conference was held in 2009 in Guatemala. Since that meeting there has been a reorganization in the works of of those considered to have remained true to the teachings of Duarte Costa. Those churches who have obtained consecrations at the hands of Castillo Mendez or Pereira de Oliveira, with false intentions, as in lies and simony, are considered to be in grave sin and are not considered validly consecrated or ordained. Under Castillo Mendez, ICAB created the Canadian Catholic Apostolic Church in 1988, ordaining Claude R. Baron as the first Canadian bishop. In 1997 Mendez agreed to intercommunion between and the International Communion of the Charismatic Episcopal Church (ICCEC).

L. Narayana for Vinodha Pictures. Aluri Chakrapani wrote the script based on Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay's novel, Devdas. C. R. Subbaraman composed the film's music. The film was edited by P. V. Narayanan, while B. S. Ranga provided the cinematography. The film focuses on Devadasu and Parvati, who have been in love since childhood. Parvati's father objects to the relationship and forces her to marry a middle-aged zamindar. Unable to cope with his failure to win Parvati, Devadas turns into a drunkard, and the rest of the film is about whether or not Devadas meets Parvati again. The film was produced in Telugu and Tamil languages (the latter titled Devadas) with slightly different casts. Akkineni Nageswara Rao, Savitri, and Lalitha played the lead roles in both versions; supporting roles were played by S. V. Ranga Rao, Chilakalapudi Seeta Rama Anjaneyulu, Dorasamy and Surabhi Kamalabai. Devadasu was released on 26 June 1953, and the Tamil version was released three months later, on 11 September 1953. Both versions were critically and commercially successful. It has since achieved cult status, with terms and phrases from the film being widely cited. Both versions proved to be a major breakthrough in Nageswara Rao's career, although they also led to him being typecast in similar roles.  Plot  Devadasu, the son of Ravulapalle zamindar Narayana Rao, and Parvati, daughter of his poor neighbour Neelakantham, are childhood friends. The zamindar enrols his son in a boarding school in the city. When the grown-up Devadasu returns to the village after finishing his education, his childhood friendship with Parvati turns into love. When Parvati's grandmother talks of the alliance, the zamindar refuses the proposal. Irritated, Neelakantham vows to find a wealthier prospective son-in-law and arranges Parvati's marriage with the zamindar of Durgapuram, an elderly widower with children. However, Parvati secretly meets Devadasu and asks him to accept her as his wife. Devadasu is surprised at her visit, sends her away, and goes back to the city. He writes to Parvati that he cannot defy his parents, so Parvati marries the old zamindar. Unable to forget her, Devadasu is despondent. He takes to drinking alcohol excessively and is encouraged by his friend Bhagawan, who also introduces him to Chandramukhi, a prostitute. While Parvati settles into her new house, Devadasu chooses the path of self-destruction. On the advice of Chandramukhi, he leaves for his village but goes to Durgapuram to keep a promise he had made to Parvati that he visit her before his death. Devadasu breathes his last in front of her house. Parvati rushes to see him, but the door is closed by her family, and she collapses.  Cast  * Akkineni Nageswara Rao as Devadasu (Devadas in Tamil) * Master Sudhakar as young Devadasu * Savitri as Parvati * Baby Anuradha as young Parvati (Telugu) * Sachu as young Parvati (Tamil) * Lalitha as Chandramukhi * S. V. Ranga Rao as Narayana Rao * Chilakalapudi Seeta Rama Anjaneyulu as the zamindar of Durgapuram * Doraswamy as Neelakantham * Surabhi Kamalabai as Parvati's grandmother * Peketi Sivaram as Bhagawan  Production  Devadasu was directed by Vedantham Raghaviah and produced by D. L. Narayana under the production banner of Vinodha Pictures. It was produced simultaneously in Telugu and Tamil languages (the latter as Devadas) . The film's script, which was written by Aluri Chakrapani, was based on the novel Devdas by Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay. The story of Devadasu revolves around a feudal lord's son Devadas falling in love with a poor girl Parvati. Due to differences in their social and economic status, Devadas cannot marry his childhood love and Parvati marries an old man. Unable to forget her, he becomes alcoholic. Devadasu was the first Telugu adaptation of Chattopadhyay's novel, and Devadas was the second Tamil adaptation of the same, following the 1937 Devadas directed by and starring P. V. Rao. Samudrala Raghavacharya and Udaykumar wrote the dialogue for the Telugu and Tamil versions, respectively. B. S. Ranga was recruited as the director of photography, and P. V. Narayanan edited the film. Vali and Kotwankar were the art directors. Akkineni Nageswara Rao and Sowcar Janaki were chosen as the lead pair. Arani Sathyanarayana portrayed the role of Devadasu's man Friday. Peketi Sivaram, who went on to become a famous director, portrayed the role of Bhagawan. S. V. Ranga Rao, Chilakalapudi Seeta Rama Anjaneyulu, and Surabhi Kamalabai were selected to portray supporting roles. Lalitha of the Travancore Sisters was signed to play Chandramukhi, the prostitute. After a week of shooting, the film was shelved due to the view that such a story might not succeed in Telugu; the production company instead produced Shanti, which became a failure. D. L. Narayana then decided to revive Devadasu as an independent producer. Janaki, who was originally chosen for the character of Parvati, was replaced by Savitri. Principal photography commenced with Nagaraja Rao, a still photographer shooting some stills of Nageswara Rao in the guise of Devadasu, with a glass in his hand and the looks of a drunkard. Rao also took shots of Savitri in Parvati's make-up in Naarsu's Studio. Impressed with these stills, Narayana decided to use the same make-up for the real shooting of the film. He showed these make-up stills to Mangaiah, the make-up man, who followed the same. Nageswara Rao, who portrayed the titular character, later recalled that Vedantam, being a Kuchipudi dance exponent and an experienced stage actor, used to enact the scenes before the actors, thereby making their job easy. He even recalled that the director shot him only at night so that he could give the character a \\"drunken, droopy\\" look. Those night-time shots were filmed over 50 days. The final length of both versions was .  Themes  Nageswara Rao compared Devadasu to his character in Batasari (1961), stating, \\"Characters like Batasari and [Devadasu] are not too explicit. They preserve their inner feelings - to be enjoyed in solitude. I am also a man like that.\\"  Music  The official soundtracks of Devadas were composed by C. R. Subbaraman. The lyrics were written by Samudrala Raghavacharya and Udumalai Narayana Kavi and K. D. Santhanam for the Telugu and Tamil versions, respectively. Though Samudrala is credited as the lyricist in the film, M. L. Narasimham of The Hindu believes that Malladi Ramakrishna Sasthri also wrote some of the lyrics. C. R. Subbaraman died before the film's release, and the remaining songs were composed by his assistants M. S. Viswanathan and T. K. Ramamoorthy. Among them was \\"Jagame Maaya\\", titled \\"Ulagaae Maayam\\" in Tamil. The soundtrack of the Telugu version was released on 1 February 1954 and the Tamil version was released on 25 March 1954; both were marketed by HMV. The soundtracks were a huge commercial success, with \\"Jagame Maaya\\" and \\"Kala Idani\\", in particular, achieving cult status. Songs like \\"Ulage Maayam\\" and \\"O Devadas\\" became popular among the Tamil diaspora. The song \\"Kudi Yemaithe\\" was composed using the Kalyani raga. The song \\"Intha Telisi\\" is composed in various ragas. The song \\"Palleku Podam\\" was later remixed by Anup Rubens for Aatadukundam Raa (2016). The soundtracks received positive reviews from critics. Reviewing the Tamil version, Randor Guy of The Hindu stated that the songs \\"contributed to the [film's] success\\". Reviewing the Telugu version, M. L. Narasimham from the same newspaper also praised the songs, noting, \\"The major contribution to the film's success, however, came from the music director, a genius called C. R. Subbaraman. Every song he composed is a hit to this day.\\" S. Theodore Baskaran in his book The Eye of the Serpent noted, \\"One factor that sustains the popularity of this film to this is the songs [sic]\\". On \\"Intha Telisi\\", Dakshinamurthy M. of The Hans India noted, \\"The 'pallavi' and 'charanam' are in Kharaharapriya, second 'charanam' is in Ranjani and the last one is in Mohana. The switching from 'charanam' to 'pallavi' and vice versa is so smooth, one forgets to notice the change in 'ragam' and 'bhavam'.\\"  Release  Devadasu, was released on 26 June 1953, and Devadas was released three months later on 11 September 1953. Both versions were commercially successful, playing for over 100 days in theatres. Randor Guy, however noted that after the film's release, there were bickerings between the partners over the division of profits and Subbaraman's widow had to go to court, as did Lalitha for her balance remuneration. In 2002, the film was screened under the \\"Devdas Retrospective Section\\" during the 33rd International Film Festival of India.  Reception  Devadasu received positive reviews from critics upon its release. M. L. Narasimham praised the performances of the film's cast, particularly that of Nageswara Rao. He added that B. S. Ranga's \\"excellent\\" cinematography and C. R. Subbaraman's music were the film's highlights apart from Vedantham Raghavaiah's direction. Reviewing Devadas, Randor Guy wrote that the film was remembered for \\"empathetically brilliant performance of Nageswara Rao in the title role and equally impressive acting by Savithri\\". S. Theodore Baskaran described the casting of Nageswara Rao and Savitri as \\"near perfect\\". Hindustan Times stated that Nageswara Rao's performance \\"remains a classic portrayal of the character that has been adapted on-screen several times\\". Film archivist P. K. Nair noted, \\"Akkineni Nageshwara Rao identified himself with the character so intensely [...] that it remains one of Telugu cinema’s outstanding performances.\\" The 2002 book Living legend, Dr. Akkineni (edited by M. K. Ramu) called Nageshwara Rao \\"the perfect manifestation of Sarat's vision\\" of the title character. In contrast, Nageshwara Rao at one point did not rate the film so highly because he felt it did not \\"convey the Sarat mood well enough.\\" C. S. H. N. Murthy, author of the 2012 Routledge article Film remakes as cross-cultural connections between North and South, praised Devadasu for \\"follow[ing] closely the text of the novel as a hypotext\\". Murthy was the first author to interpret the Devadas phenomenon in terms of de-westernising media studies by appropriately locating the character of Devdas into the relevant and contemporary religious ethos of India that time. Murthy was not only critical of the Western Scholars' interpretations of Devadas as a narcissist and pseudo-masochist but also questioned their theoretical frameworks based on Western Sexualities and Post-feminism. While placing the crux of the adaptation studies using film as text, he rightly pointed out the dissonance in trying to draw such comparisons based on Western film theories. His article endeavours to make a critical intervention in current South Asian Studies by aiming to provide novel theoretical frame work, hitherto unknown and unheard in Indian film studies, to which philosophical and traditional tenets grounding the novella of Devdas can be anchored.  Legacy  Devadasu and Devadas are regarded as among the most successful films in Telugu and Tamil cinema respectively. Upon release, the dialogue Thaagithe maruva galanu, thaaganivvaru, marichipothe thaagagalanu, maruvanivvaru () became famous. The film proved to be a major breakthrough in Nageswara Rao's career. The success of the film made him known as the \\"Tragedy King\\" of Telugu cinema and also led to his becoming typecast in similar roles. In order to shed the tragic-romantic hero image, he accepted a comic role in Missamma (1955). Savitri too appeared in Missamma, and her character in that film was described by Pa. Dheenadhayalan of Dinamani as an antithesis of her role in Devadasu. Vazhvey Maayam (1982), which was named after a line from \\"Ulagaae Maayam\\", was described by Encyclopaedia of Indian Cinema as an \\"update of the Devdas plot\\". In July 2007, S. R. Ashok Kumar of The Hindu asked eight Tamil directors to list ten of their favourite films. Balu Mahendra named Devadas as one of his top ten Tamil films. He said that it had \\"superb lighting by B. S. Ranga, excellent performances by A. Nageswara Rao and Savithri, and haunting music by C. R. Subbaraman\\". Actor Sivakumar stated, \\"You can’t reproduce movies like Parasakthi, Pasamalar, Devadas, Veerapandiya Kattabomman or Ratha Kanneer [...] By remaking such films, you are lowering yourself, while it enhances the original artists’ image.\\" YVS Chowdary titled his 2006 comedy film Devadasu, though it had no similarity with this film. In May 2012, Radhika Rajamani of Rediff.com mentioned Devadasu for the letter D in her list, \\"The A to Z of Telugu Cinema\\". During a programme titled \\"Telugu Cinema Prasthanam\\" organised by the film society of Vishakhapatnam, writer and actor Ravi Kondala Rao placed Devadasu among other Telugu films like Raja Harishchandra (1913), Bhakta Prahlada (1932), Mala Pilla (1938), Pathala Bhairavi (1951) and Lava Kusa (1963) during a speech on the role of Telugu cinema in the hundred years of Indian cinema. In April 2013, CNN-News18 included the film in its list of \\"100 greatest Indian films of all time\\". Indo-Asian News Service described Devadasu as one of Nageswara Rao's \\"best films\\". Dilip Kumar, who portrayed Devadas in the 1955 film directed by Bimal Roy, admitted that Nageswara Rao's performance as the character was better than his own, remarking, \\"There is only one Devadas (1953), and that is Akkineni Nageswara Rao.\\" A scene from Devadasu, in which the title character converses with a street dog while drunk, was parodied in a promotional still from Majnu (2016), where the male lead (Nani) humorously converses with a stuffed puppy, while imitating Devadasu's mannerisms.

The word with long ā in the second system, is the plural of sharīf \\"noble\\", from sharafa \\"to be highborn\\", but ašhraf (), with short a, is the elative of sharīf meaning \\"very noble\\", \\"nobler\\", \\"noblest\\". Like the Sadah (plural of Sayyid), Ashraf often take their names from ancestry from Muhammad, Fatima and Ali and have in many Muslim societies Ashraf evolved into an honorific denoting \\"master\\" or \\"gentry\\". More precisely, the Ashraf are descendants of Ali's elder son, Hassan, and the Sadah those of Ali's younger son Husayn. During the Abbasid period, the term was applied to all Ahl al-Bayt, basically Muhammad's own family, including, for example, the descendants of Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya, of Ali's second wife and of the Hashemites. During the Fatimid Dynasty, the use of the term was restricted to the descendants of Hasan (the Hasanids) and Husayn (the Husaynids) only. This restriction remained in force even after Egypt became Sunni again under the Ayyubids. Also, the Ashraf tribes exist along countries including Somalia, Sudan and Ethiopia. There are 2 to 3 sub- categories of them also, which usually have Sharif in their middle or surname. They are originally from Yemen and have in the recent generations migrated to Somalia due to its wealth and profitable businesses at the time, before the civil war broke out. Many tribes couldn't distinguish between Ashraf and Sadah. Sadah, Ashraf and Sayyid became a Sharif's title. The distinction between Hasani Ashraf and Husayni Ashraf is not known. As late as the beginning of the nineteenth century, Sayyid had no meaning other than Sharif. Abdurrahman al-Gabarti felt compelled to explain that a certain As-Sayyid Ali Al-Qhabtan was a Mamluk and not a Sharif, as might have been mistakenly inferred from his title. The title in this case, meaning a Mamluk master, originated from the Maghribi usage of \\"Sidi\\", which was equivalent in meaning to Emir or Shaikh. In modern usage, Sayyid has lost its religious significance and means simply \\"Mister\\". Well aware of their distinguished descent, the Ashraf tribes kept genealogical records and were socially acknowledged as a religious elite. Inevitably, doubts arose concerning the descent of many claimants to the title. Al-Gabarti once commented of one person: \\"He is one of the Ashraf of true genealogy. Sayyid Muhammad Murtada verified his genealogy.\\" One concept during record keeping was the term of Najeeb al-Tarfayn or \\"Noble on both sides\\". This was applied to those Ashraf who have both Imams Hassan and Hussain in Patrilineal and Matrilineal lineages. Although this concept has been debated on by many Sunni and Shia scholars however it has generally been agreed that Prophet Muhammad had stated in a Hadeeth that his true descendant Al Mahdi would be a Najeeb AlTarfayn who would deliver the Muslims of the last age out of their misery from the clutches of the Dajjal or Antichrist. Such Ashraf carry the titles \\"Sayyid AlShareef\\", \\"Sayyidayn\\", \\"Shareefayn\\" or \\"Sheikh Assayyid\\" before their names. They also kept two white colored daggers as opposed to a single white one by other Ashraf denoting their superior nobility among the Ashraf. Usage in South Asia In South Asia, ashraf designates a major social-status group within the greater Muslim community, namely all Muslims of foreign ancestry. This includes Sayyids, Shaikhs and Arain as well as other Muslims of \\"foreign\\" ancestry, such as Mughals.

Beginning her career at age 13, Millar was a prominent star of musical comedies for two decades. In 1902, she married the composer Lionel Monckton, who wrote the scores of many of her shows and songs that she made famous. She was one of the most prominent West End theatre performers of the early 20th century, starring in such long- running hits as The Toreador (1901), The Orchid (1903) The Spring Chicken (1905), The New Aladdin (1906) The Girls of Gottenberg (1907), Our Miss Gibbs (1909), The Quaker Girl (1910), Gipsy Love (1912), The Dancing Mistress (1912), The Marriage Market (1913) and A Country Girl (1914). After Monckton died in 1924, Millar married the 2nd Earl of Dudley. Life and career Gertrude Millar was born in Manningham, Bradford, where her father, John Millar, was a mill worker, and her mother, Elizabeth (née Miller), was a worsted-stuff worker and dressmaker.Gänzl, Kurt. \\"Millar, Gertrude (1879–1952)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press (2004), accessed 16 April 2008 Early career Millar and husband Lionel Monckton As a child, Millar performed in London pantomimes, beginning with Babes in the Wood at the St. James Theatre in Manchester, at the age of 13.Obituary in Daily Telegraph, 26 April 1952 She started out as a singer and dancer in the music halls of Yorkshire. Later, she moved to London where she was soon earning good notices and better pay appearing in variety show bills. By 1897, she was playing the role of Phyllis Crosby in A Game of Cards at Shodfriars Hall, Boston, Lincolnshire. Next she toured in The New Barmaid in the role of Dora; in The Silver Lining; and as Sadie Pinkhose, the \\"other woman\\", in The Lady Detective. In 1899, she played Dandini in a version of Cinderella at the Grand Theatre, Fulham.The Times obituary, 26 April 1952, p. 8 In the new century, she starred in a series of hit musical comedies produced by George Edwardes. In 1900, she played Isabel Blythe in the touring production of The Messenger Boy. Edwardes's next show was The Toreador in 1901 at the Gaiety Theatre in London. Lionel Monckton, one of the show's composers, had seen Millar in The Messenger Boy and requested that she be given the role of the bridesmaid Cora in the new musical, singing \\"Keep Off the Grass\\". She made the song popular and earned a second song, \\"Captivating Cora\\", and a third, \\"I'm not a simple little girl\\". These hits established Millar in London. The Gaiety Theatre closed for renovations in 1902, and the last show at the old theatre was The Linkman; or, Gaiety Memories, with Millar starring as Morgiana. She married Monckton on December 25, 1902 in St. Mark's Church, Surbiton, England.Ancestry.com, England, Select Marriages 1538–1973, FHL Film Number 1278894, Reference ID: item 7 402 Monckton continued to write hit songs for her in subsequent shows.

Violet Anstruther in The Orchid, the show that opened the new Gaiety (1903; introducing the songs \\"Little Mary\\", \\"Liza Ann\\", and \\"Come with me to the zoo\\"). She starred as Rosalie in The Spring Chicken (1905; singing \\"Alice sit by the fire\\" and \\"The Delights of London\\") and as Lally in The New Aladdin (1906). She next starred as Mitzi in The Girls of Gottenberg (1907; singing the duet \\"Two Little Sausages\\", with Edmund Payne, and the Wagnerian parody \\"Rhinegold\\"). Soon afterwards, Edwardes cast her as Franzi at the Hicks Theatre in the English-language production of Ein Walzertraum (A Waltz Dream, 1908) by Oscar Straus. Although Millar was able to sell the light musical comedy songs composed for her at the Gaiety, Oscar Straus's music was too demanding for her small voice, and she was sent to New York to star in the Broadway production of The Girls of Gottenberg. On the morning of 30 October 1905 at Millar's and Monckton's residence in Russell Square, London, Baron Gunther Rau von Holzhauzen, an infatuated young admirer of Millar's, shot himself with a revolver in Millar's boudoir. A maid discovered him hiding there, and she ran upstairs screaming to wake the Moncktons as the gun was fired. Von Holzhauzen died hours later at a nearby hospital. He visited and lunched with Millar occasionally over a period of many months and had written letters to her professing to love her and later expressing despondency over his finances.\\"Tragedy in a Boudoir\\", The Advertiser, 5 December 1905, p. 10 Later years As Pierrot in Our Miss Gibbs After she returned to London, from New York, some of Millar's biggest successes were still in front of her. They included the title role of the hit Gaiety musical, Our Miss Gibbs (1909), with Millar introducing the songs \\"Moonstruck\\", \\"Yorkshire\\", and \\"Our farm\\", all written for her by Monckton. Monckton and Millar then moved to Edwardes' newest theatre, the Adelphi, where she played the title role, Prudence Pym, in another international hit, The Quaker Girl (1910). In this, she popularised the songs \\"The Quaker Girl\\", \\"The Little Grey Bonnet\\", and \\"Tony from America\\". After this, she returned to continental operetta, playing Lady Babby in Edwardes's English language version of Franz Lehár's Gipsy Love (1912) at Daly's Theatre. In this role, the musical demands were light, and the show was a success.Traubner, Richard. Operetta: a theatrical history, London: Routledge (2004), pp. 238–239, She returned to the Adelphi to play Nancy Joyce in The Dancing Mistress (1912), and back at Daly's she played Kitty Kent in The Marriage Market (1913). This was followed by the role of Nan in a major revival of A Country Girl (1914). She also played Sallie Denbigh in The House of Bondage, a 1914 film.IMDB entry for Millar World War I brought a change in the tastes of the theatregoing public. Edwardes died in 1915, and Millar's husband was in poor health. After appearing in two Monckton revues (Bric à Brac (1915; she sang \\"Neville was a Devil\\") and Airs and Graces (1917)), two unsuccessful musical comedies (Houp La! (1916) and Flora (1918)) and some productions in the provinces, Millar left the stage in 1918. Monckton died on 15 February 1924.

Etymology The specific name, defilippii, is in honor of Italian zoologist Filippo De Filippi.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Causus defilippii, p. 67). Description The average total length (including tail) of C. defilippii is 20–35 cm (about 8-14 inches), rarely exceeding . The head is short and wide, and the snout is prominent, pointed and upturned. The rostral is large. The eyes are medium-sized. The circumorbital ring consists of 1–2 preocular scales, 1–2 postoculars and 1–2 suboculars that separate the eye from the supralabials. There are a total of 6–7 supralabials and 7–10 sublabials. The first 3–4 sublabials are in contact with the anterior chin shields. The posterior chin shields are very small and indistinguishable from other posterior scales. The temporal scales number 2+3, sometimes 2+4, and rarely 1+2. Midbody there are 16–18 rows of weakly keeled dorsal scales that have a velvety appearance. There are 108–128 ventral scales: rarely more than 117 in males, or less than 118 in females. The anal scale is single. The divided subcaudals number 10–19: seldom less than 14 in males, or more than 15 in females. The color pattern consists of a light brown, pinkish brown to gray or grayish green ground color, overlaid with a series of 20–30 crescent-shaped dark markings that run down the back. However, these marking may be indistinct. The head has a characteristic V-shaped marking with the apex on the frontal plate. There is also an oblique dark streak present behind the eye. The belly is yellowish while, uniformly colored or with scattered small grayish brown spots. Juvenile specimens are commonly a glossy black or gray. Geographic range The snouted night adder is found in coastal Kenya and Tanzania through eastern Africa (Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique) to South Africa (Northern, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal Provinces) as far south as Durban, and on the island of Unguja. The type locality was originally listed as \\"Buenos Ayres\\", obviously a mistake. It was restricted by Broadley (1971) to Africa, Puku. Habitat C. defilippii occurs in moist and dry savanna, coastal thickets, and forests from sea level to around altitude.Spawls S, Howell K, Drewes R, Ashe J (2004). A Field Guide To The Reptiles Of East Africa. London: A & C Black Publishers Ltd. 543 pp. . It favors moist surroundings, but has also been found in dry areas on rocky hillsides and escarpments. Behavior The snouted night adder is generally nocturnal, but not entirely. It is mostly terrestrial, but sometimes climbs into low vegetation in pursuit of frogs, and is also a good swimmer. When not basking, it remains hidden in ground cover, brush piles, and in holes. If disturbed, it inflates itself and hisses. It is slow-moving for the most part, but can strike quickly. In captivity, however, it soon becomes tame and unwilling to strike. Venom Little is known about the venom of C. defilippii, but the symptoms described in the few existing case histories include rapid swelling, fever, sometimes intense pain, and occasionally lymphadenopathy. The swelling usually subsided after 2–3 days, and there have not been any reports of necrosis. Currently, there is no antivenin that provides protection against bites from this species.

Currently, they live in Azerbaijan, Russia, Georgia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and many other countries. The total number is about 10,000 people. They speak the Udi language. Some also speak Azerbaijani, Russian, Georgian and Armenian languages depending on where they reside. Their religion is Christianity.  History  The Udi are considered to be the descendants of the people of Caucasian Albania. According to the classical authors, the Udi inhabited the area of the eastern Caucasus along the coast of the Caspian Sea, in a territory extending to the Kura River in the north, as well as the ancient province of Utik. Today, most Udis belong to the Eastern Orthodox Church while others are still trying to restore the Church of Caucasian Albania. Centuries of life in the Armenian, Iranian, and Turkish spheres influenced their culture, as is expressed in Udi folk traditions and the material culture.The Red Book of Peoples: The Udis The Udi are first mentioned in Herodotus' Histories (5th century BC). Describing the Battle of Marathon, during the Greek-Persian war (490 BC), the author noted that Udi soldiers also were at war as a part of nine satrapy of the Persian army. The Udis are mentioned in the Geographica of the ancient Greek writer Strabo (1st century BC) in his description of the Caspian Sea and the Caucasian Albania. The ethnic term \\"Udi\\" was mentioned first in the Natural history by the ancient Roman author Pliny the Elder (1st century AD). Further ancient information about the Udi people can be found in books by Ptolemy (2nd century), Gaius Asinius Quadratus and many other authors. Since the 5th century, the Udi people are often mentioned in the Armenian sources. More extensive information is given in The History of AluankMovses Kagancatvasiy, The History of Aluank (в 3-х книгах) by Movses Kagancatvasiy. The Udi were one of the predominating Albanian tribes К. В. Тревер К вопросу о культуре Кавказской Албании (доклад на XXV Международном конгрессе востоковедов, 1960 год) and they were considered the creators of Caucasian Albania. The Byzantines cooperated extensively with their leader Sandilch in the latter half of the 6th century. Both capitals of Caucasian Albania: Kabalak (also called Kabalaka, Khabala, Khazar, today's Qabala) and Partav (also called Partaw, today's Barda), were located in the historical territory of the Udi. They occupied extensive territories from the bank of the Caspian Sea to the Caucasian Mountains, on the left and right banks of the Kura River. One of the regions in this area was named \\"Utik\\". After the conquest of the Caucasian Albania by the Arabs, the number of the Udi and their territory were gradually reduced.  Udi villages  Until 1991, the main Udi villages were Vartashen and Nij in Azerbaijan, as well as the village of Zinobiani in Georgia. In the recent past, Udi people also lived in Mirzabeily, Soltan Nuha, Jourlu, Mihlikuvah, Vardanli (now Kərimli), Bajan, Kirzan, and Yenikend, in contemporary times they have mostly assimilated with the people of Azerbaijan.Игорь Кузнецов. Удины Vartashen was mainly a Udi village, where the Vartashen dialect of the Udi language was spoken by about 3000 people in the 1980s. The Udis of Vartashen belonged to the Armenian Apostolic Church and had Armenian surnames. During the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, the Udis as well as the Armenians were expelled to Armenia. Some 50 Udi people remained among some 7000 ethnic Azeris in the town, which was renamed to Oğuz.Wolfgang Schulze: Towards a History of Udi. International Journal of Diachronic Linguistics 1, 2005, pp. 55–91. Today the only place of concentrated Udi settlement are the village of Nij in Azerbaijan and the village of Zinobiani in Georgia, which was founded by Udi refugees from Vartashen in the 1920s. A significant group of Udi live in the Georgian village of Zinobiani, founded by Udi from Vartashen in the 1920s. Small groups reside in Russia in the Rostov region (Shahty, Taganrog, Rostov- na-Donu, Azov, Aleksandrovka); in the Krasnodar territory (Krasnodar, areas of Dinskoy, Leningrad, Kushchevsky); in the Stavropol Territory (Minvody, Pyatigorsk); in the Volgograd region (Volgograd, Dubovy Ovrag); and also in Sverdlovsk, Ivanovo, Kaluga areas, Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Astrakhan; in Georgia in the outskirts of Tbilisi, Poti, Rustavi, in Armenia mainly in the Lori Province, and Aktau in Kazakhstan. Some also live in Ukraine's (Kharkiv oblast).  Language  The Udi language is a Northeast Caucasian language of the Lezgic branch. The two primary dialects are Nij (Nidzh) and Vartashen. The people today also speak Azerbaijani, Russian, and Georgian. The Udi are commonly bilingual, and less frequently trilingual, depending on residence and work. Many use Udi only in daily life, but for official purposes, the Udi use the language of the country in which they reside, such as Azerbaijani, Russian, or Armenian.  Dialects  The Udi language has two dialects: Nidzh and Vartashen. Nidzh dialect has sub-dialects that are divided into three subgroups - bottom, intermediate, top. Linguists believe the dialects originated according to geographic groupings of the Udi from the Tauz region: the villages of Kirzan and Artzah (Karabah, v. Seysylla, Gasankala) moved to Nidzh and Oguz.Игорь Кузнецов. Удины. The Vartashen dialect has two sub- dialects: Vartashen and Oktomberry.  History  In the past the Udi language was one of the widespread languages of Caucasian Albania on the basis of which, in the 5th century the Caucasian Albanian script,И. В. Кузнецов.

Some Remarks on the Caucasian Albanian Palimpsests (2007) pp. 210. The alphabet had 52 letters. The language was widely used, as major Bible texts were translated into the Caucasian Albanian language. Church services were conducted in it. After the fall of the Albanian state, the Caucasian Albanian liturgical language was gradually replaced by Armenian in church. Due to their Caucasian Udi language and their Christian faith, the Udis are regarded as the last remnants of the old Caucasian Albanians. Under Persian rule, some of them converted to Islam, and soon adopted the Azeri language. The Armenian Apostolic Church held services exclusively in the Armenian language and refused to ordain a local Udi priest, against which Udis protested:National Archives of Armenia, fund 56, list 1, file 5214, p. 1 (in Armenian, English translation taken from A Brief introduction on Nizh village.

Under the Cook Islands Constitution, the Sovereign in Right of New Zealand (currently Elizabeth II) has been Head of State of the Cook Islands since 4 August 1965. The Sovereign is represented by the Queen's Representative; as such, the Queen is the de jure head of state, holding several powers that are hers alone, while the Queen's Representative is sometimes referred to as the de facto head of state. The viceregal position is currently held by Tom Marsters. The Queen's official title is: Elizabeth the Second, By the Grace of God, Queen of New Zealand and Her other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith. The heir apparent is Elizabeth II's eldest son, Prince Charles, Prince of Wales. Constitutional In 1965 Queen Elizabeth II became Head of State of the Cook Islands when the country obtained a position of free-association with New Zealand. Article 2 of the Cook Islands Constitution states that \\"Her Majesty the Queen in Right of New Zealand shall be the Head of State of the Cook Islands.\\"Constitution of the Cook Islands The expression \\"in Right of New Zealand\\" refers directly to the constitutional concept of the \\"Realm of New Zealand,\\" as described in the 1983 Letters Patent Constituting the Office of Governor-General of New Zealand, approved by the Cook Islands after consultation with New Zealand. In clause 1, the Realm of New Zealand is defined as including New Zealand, the self-governing state of the Cook Islands, the self-governing state of Niue, Tokelau and the Ross Dependency. Thus, Queen Elizabeth II, by virtue of being Head of State of her entire Realm of New Zealand, as described in the Letters Patent, is also Head of State of that part of her Realm of New Zealand referred to in the Letters Patent as \\"the self-governing state of the Cook Islands.\\" The New Zealand - Cook Islands Joint Centenary Declaration states that: Succession Royal succession is governed by the Royal Succession Act 2013.Royal Succession Act 2013 as at 26 March 2015 This legislation lays out the rules that the Monarch cannot be a Roman Catholic, and must be in communion with the Church of England upon ascending the throne. Queen's Representative and Governor-General The Queen's constitutional roles in the Cook Islands have been almost entirely delegated to the Queen's Representative. Originally the viceregal representative was titled as High Commissioner and was appointed by the Governor-General of New Zealand on the recommendation of the Minister of the Government of New Zealand who was deemed responsible for matters relating to the Cook Islands, and after consultation with the Premier of the Cook Islands. In the early 1980s, the Cook Island Constitution was amended so that the words \\"Queen's Representative\\" were substituted for the word \\"High Commissioner,\\"Constitution Amendment (No 10) Act 1981–82 and the words \\"Prime Minister\\" were substituted for the word \\"Premier.\\"Constitution Amendment (No 9) Act 1980–81 Further, the 1981 Constitution Amendment decreed that the Queen's representative was appointed directly by the Queen herself; not the Governor-General of New Zealand. The text states that \\"[there] shall be a representative of Her Majesty the Queen in the Cook Islands, to be known as the Queen's Representative [to be appointed] by Her Majesty the Queen...\\" Article 5 of the Constitution states that the Queen's Representative is to act on the advice of her Cook Islands Ministers: \\"The Queen's Representative in the performance of his functions as the representative of Her Majesty the Queen shall act on the advice of Cabinet, the Prime Minister, or the appropriate Minister as the case may be...\\" Over the Realm of New Zealand, the Letters Patent established the office of the Governor-General, and provide that the Governor-General is \\"[the Queen's] representative in [the] Realm of New Zealand\\" who may exercise his or her powers and authorities \\"without prejudice to the office, powers, or authorities of any other person who has been or may be appointed to represent [Her Majesty] in any part of [her] Realm of New Zealand and to exercise powers and authorities on [her] behalf.\\"Letters Patent Constituting the Office of Governor-General of New Zealand However, the relationship between the Governor-General of New Zealand and the Queen's Representative is quite different. Under the Cook Islands' Constitution, executive power is \\"vested in Her Majesty the Queen in right of New Zealand... the executive authority of the Cook Islands may be exercised on behalf of Her Majesty by the Queen's Representative either directly or through officers subordinate to him. This leaves the Governor-General with only an indirect constitutional role in the form of the defence and external affairs prerogatives, arising from the Governor-General's constitutional position in terms of the Realm as a whole. Any viceregal powers and responsibilities in the Cook Islands are vested in the Queen's Representative, leaving the Governor-General with no substantive role in relation to the territory.  Royal assent Royal assent and proclamation are required for all acts of Parliament; usually granted by the Queen's Representative. Symbols of monarchy References to the monarch are commonplace in public life in the Cook Islands. There are references to the Crown in legal documents, Oaths of office taken by the Queen's Representative, Members of Parliament and Judges of the High Court, and prescriptions in the Constitution require allegiance to be sworn to the reigning Sovereign as the Head of State of the Cook Islands. Unlike in the United Kingdom, the Queen's Official Birthday is a public holiday on the first Monday in June. The Queen's portrait appears on the obverse of coins, and all banknotes feature the portrait of the Queen as the watermark. However, only the $20 banknote bears her image as the main feature (Cook Islands use the New Zealand dollar). The Queen undertook a royal tour of the Cook Islands between 28 January and 29 January 1974.

The route runs from exit 19 along the Adirondack Northway (Interstate 87 or I-87) in Queensbury and follows Aviation Road, Quaker Road, and Lower Warren Street through Queensbury to Hudson Falls, where it terminates at an intersection with U.S. Route 4 (US 4) in the center of the village. The portion of NY 254 along Lower Warren Street and River Street has had several designations over the years. From 1924 to 1930, it was part of the original NY 30\\\\. In 1927, it also became part of US 4, which initially overlapped NY 30 from Glens Falls to Whitehall. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 30 was reassigned elsewhere while US 4 was rerouted to bypass Glens Falls to the east. As a result, Lower Warren Street and River Street became part of NY 32B. The NY 32B designation remained in place until the mid-1960s when the Quaker Road arterial was built. NY 32B was partially replaced by NY 254, the designation assigned to the new highway around Glens Falls. The portion of NY 254 between US 9 and Lower Warren Street is maintained by Warren County and co-designated as County Route 47 (CR 47) and CR 70\\\\. Route description NY 254 begins at the southbound ramp of Adirondack Northway (I-87) exit 19 north of Glens Falls in the town of Queensbury. The route heads eastward from the interchange as Aviation Road, passing by many commercial buildings and Aviation Mall. As it passes along the north side of the mall, NY 254 curves to the southeast before veering back to the northeast ahead of an intersection with the four-lane US 9 (Upper Glen Street). The route continues past US 9; however, maintenance of the highway is transferred from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to Warren County at the US 9 junction. Now co-designated as CR 47, NY 254 progresses eastward along the four-lane Quaker Road, serving as a northerly bypass of the city of Glens Falls. NY 254 eastbound after the junction with US 9 in Queensbury in 2013 after CR 47 shields were added alongside As the route heads east, it passes Pine View Cemetery and several local businesses. At an intersection with Glenwood Avenue (CR 34), the county's internal designation for NY 254 becomes CR 70, whereafter the route passes over Halfway Brook and under the Gerald B. Solomon Bikeway Bridge – a part of the Warren County Bikeway. The highway progresses southeasterly upon intersecting NY 9L as NY 254 turns due southeast to avoid Floyd Bennett Memorial Airport. Along this stretch, NY 254 heads through undeveloped land before entering another area of commercial development as it approaches the outskirts of Hudson Falls. Here, the route meets NY 32 at Highland Avenue before intersecting Lower Warren Street (here unsigned NY 911E) on the banks of the Hudson River. NY 254 turns east at NY 911E, becoming state maintained once more as it follows Lower Warren Street across the Glens Falls Feeder Canal and along the Hudson River into Washington County and the village of Hudson Falls. As River Street, NY 254 heads to the southeast for a short distance before terminating at an intersection with US 4 in downtown Hudson Falls. NY 196 begins one block to the south of this junction. History Prior to the 1930s, the NY 254 designation was used for a portion of highway running between Bristol and Lakeville. This portion was later redesignated U.S. Route 20A NY 254 eastbound at the junction with NY 9L in Queensbury Warren Street in Glens Falls, Lower Warren Street in Queensbury, and River Street in Hudson Falls were originally designated as part of NY 30 in 1924. In late 1926, the U.S. Highway System was created. One of the routes assigned at this time was US 4, which overlapped NY 30 between Glens Falls and Whitehall. This edition shows U.S. Routes as they were first officially signed in 1927. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the NY 30 designation was reassigned elsewhere while US 4 was reconfigured to continue south from Hudson Falls to East Greenbush. The former routing of US 4 into Glens Falls became part of NY 32B, an alternate route of NY 32 that followed the Hudson River between Schuylerville and Glens Falls. All of NY 32B south of Hudson Falls was concurrent to US 4. NY 32B was truncated over time, eventually consisting of just the portion between Boulevard (then-NY 32) in Queensbury and US 4 in Hudson Falls. In the mid-1960s, a new arterial was constructed around the northern and eastern extents of Glens Falls. The roadway, designated as NY 254 , extended from I-87 in the north to Warren Street (NY 32B) in the south. NY 254 then continued east to US 4 in Hudson Falls, replacing NY 32B. The short segment of Warren Street between NY 32 and NY 254, formerly the westernmost portion of NY 32B, is now NY 911E, an unsigned reference route.

The young men are making themselves ill eating the sweets they buy to gain the attention of the beautiful, but no-nonsense Mary, who disapproves of their attempts at familiarity. Miss Gibbs has fallen in love with a young bank clerk who is actually the son of an Earl, Lord Eynsford, in disguise. His father would not consent to his marrying a shop girl. When she discovers that young Eynsford has lied to her, she breaks up with him. Mary's cousin Timothy travels from Yorkshire to play in the town band for a contest at the Crystal Palace. He is a very unsophisticated country boy, and he has a variety of humorous big city adventures. Timothy gets entangled in a crime by mistakenly picking up a bag. Inside the bag is the Ascot Gold Cup (the trophy for Britain's most prestigious long-distance horse race). The cup has just been stolen by the Hon. Hughie Pierrepoint. ;Act II At the Franco-British Exhibition in White City, Timothy worries that the police will find him and accuse him of the crime.

He is the American Cancer Society Professor in the Department of Microbiology and Immunobiology at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts.  Biography  He trained with Sydney Brenner, Arthur Pardee, and Francois Jacob at the Institut Pasteur in France before arriving at Harvard University.  Research  Beckwith led the research group that in 1969 isolated the first gene from a bacterial chromosome. Some of the researchers worked in the Beckwith laboratory at the Harvard Medical School and consisted of several now well-known scientists and doctors including James A. Shapiro and Lawrence Eron, MD.; others ( Lorne MacHattie and Garret Ihler ) were located in the laboratory of Charles Thomas. The procedure used was devised by Garret Ihler and Karin Ippen. Complementary strands of the gene, carried within non-complementary strands of viral DNA, from viruses transducing the gene in reverse orientations which had been separated by a poly U,G density-gradient technique, were annealed to form double-stranded DNA. The single-stranded DNA was then removed using a single- strand specific DNase under investigation in the Thomas laboratory, leaving the double-stranded gene intact. The elegant electron micrographs of the pre- and post-digested DNA were taken by MacHatty in the Thomas laboratory. Before and following this experiment, Beckwith made important contributions to the study of bacterial genetics. His studies include the mechanisms of protein secretion, disulfide bond formation, and cell division. In addition, he is a prominent speaker on the social implications of science and has been an activist in science. He spoke out against the testing of boys for XYY chromosomes and was a member of the ELSI (Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications) committee of the Human Genome Project initiated by James D. Watson. He has worked on issues of social responsibility in science and since 1983 has taught a course on the Social Issues in Biology at Harvard University, one of the first of its kind. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1986.  Honors  In 2005 he received the Abbott-ASM Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Society for Microbiology for \\"sustained, remarkable contributions to the microbiological sciences\\". Beckwith was the 2009 recipient of the Selman A. Waksman Award in Microbiology from the National Academy of Sciences. Beckwith is a member of the National Academy of Sciences.

Archib is the 'parent village' of these, because three months a year the whole community used to reassemble in Archi to engage in communal work.The Peoples of the Red Book: Archis Their culture is one of the most distinct and best-preserved of all the cultures of Dagestan.The Archi language dictionary Map of Archi language and Archi villages. They have a total population of about 1,200, and speak their own language. Their habitat is about 2,000 meters above sea level in the Kara-Koisu basin of a range of the Caucasus. History The origin of the Archi people is unknown. Their name was first mentioned in the historical chronicles written by Muhammed Rafi from Shirvan in the 13th or 14th century. They were part of the Avar community Dursakh (or Rissib) and from time to time paid tribute to the Gazikumukh Khanate. They became subjects of the Russian Empire after Dagestan was annexed by Russia in 1813. According to the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary there were 802 Archis in Gazikumukh Okrug in 1886. Since 1899 they were part of the Gunib Okrug, Dagestan Oblast. In 1921 they became part of the Dagestan ASSR. According to the First All-Union Census of the Soviet Union in 1926 there were 863 Archis in the Soviet Union. In the next censuses they were not considered a separate ethnic group, but rather as a subgroup of Avars. According to the Great Soviet Encyclopedia in the 1959 Soviet Census, all Archis declared themselves as Avars, though still preserving their native language and some ethnographic features. The 2002 Russian Census registered 89 Archis in Russia, which were again considered to be a subgroup of Avars. In the 2010 Russian Census there were only 12 Archis. Language The Archi language is a Northeast Caucasian language of the Lezgic branch. It is colloquial, unwritten, and spoken only in several villages. Avar and Lak are widely spoken. The first information about Archi language was a letter from Peter von Uslar to Franz Anton Schiefner dated June 11, 1863, which was published in the \\"Grammar of the Lak language\\" book as an appendix. Peter von Uslar tells an Archi legend about their language: Culture The ethnonym Archi originates from the name of the village Archib in Lak. The main paradox with the Archi people is that although they are a subgroup of the Avar people by ethnic self-identification, their language is similar to the Lezgian people, and culture to the Avar people and Lak people. They were considered to be a subgroup of Avars in all Soviet censuses, and are still considered to be so in Russian censuses. The Archi people are overwhelmingly Sunni Muslims. The existence of monuments written in Arabic in the Kufic script suggests that they converted to Islam not later than the 10th century.

John Raymond Godley, 3rd Baron Kilbracken, DSC (17 October 1920 – 14 August 2006), was a British-born, later Irish-resident peer, wartime naval pilot, journalist, author and farmer. He was the son of The 2nd Baron Kilbracken; his grandfather, Arthur Godley, 1st Baron Kilbracken, was William Ewart Gladstone's private secretary. He became the third Baron Kilbracken on his father's death in October 1950, and became an active member of the House of Lords. After many years living in the Republic of Ireland, he renounced his British nationality and took up Irish citizenship in the 1970s, as a protest at British actions in Northern Ireland. Early and private life Godley was born in Chester Street in Belgravia, and educated at Arnold House School in St John's Wood in London, followed by Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford, developing an interest in horse racing and betting at both latter places, and rowing in the first VIII at Eton and the University second boat, Isis, at Oxford. After serving in the Fleet Air Arm in the Second World War, he returned to his studies, and graduated with an MA in 1948. He married twice. He married Penelope Anne Reyne in 1943. They had two children, Christopher (born 1 January 1945) and another son, who died aged three days. He and Penelope divorced in 1949. In April 1951, he moved permanently to the family's estate, Killegar House, in Carrigallen, County Leitrim. His father's fortunes had not flourished and he had been forced by circumstances to put Killegar on the market. The house was dilapidated, and had not been occupied for several years but he was determined to live there. He farmed the estate organically from the 1950s. His second marriage was to an Australian ex-spy and writer, Susan Lee Heazlewood, who was thirty-six years his junior, in 1981. They had one son, the Irish poet Sean Godley (born 1981), before divorcing in 1989. He also had a daughter, Lisa. He died in Cavan in August 2006. Wartime service Having taken flying lessons while at school, when World War II broke out, he joined the Fleet Air Arm in 1940, mainly flying obsolescent Fairey Swordfish bombers (known as \\"stringbags\\") from merchant aircraft carriers, merchant ships with an added flight deck used to escort merchant convoys on the Atlantic. He was commissioned in 1941, and later commanded 'P' Flight of 836 Naval Air Squadron. He was promoted to lieutenant commander in 1944 and took command of 835 Naval Air Squadron. He was awarded the DSC for commanding the mixed Swordfish and Grumman Wildcat squadron from the escort carrier HMS Nairana in an attack on enemy shipping on 29 January 1945. He transferred to command of 714 Naval Air Squadron, ending the war flying a Fairey Barracuda. Post-war writing career After finishing his studies, he considered joining the Foreign Service, but decided to become a journalist instead, working for the Daily Mirror from 1947 to 1949, the Daily Express from 1949 to 1951, and then freelance. He was originally as a racing correspondent and later mainly as a foreign correspondent in places including Aden, Angola, China, Cuba and Yemen. He wrote for many journals, including The New Yorker, Punch, Sports Illustrated, Reader's Digest and Good Housekeeping. He also wrote several books under the name \\"John Godley\\", including Tell Me the Next One (1950), The Master Forger (1951), Living Like a Lord (1955), A Peer Behind the Curtain (1959) and Shamrocks and Unicorns (1962), a biography of the Vermeer forger Han van Meegeren (1967), a war autobiography entitled Bring Back My Stringbag (1979), and The Easy Way to Bird Recognition (1982), which won an award and was followed up by The Easy Way to Tree Recognition (1983) and The Easy Way to Wild Flower Recognition (1984). Peerage He succeeded his father as Baron Kilbracken in 1950, while visiting New Zealand to celebrate the centenary of the foundation of Christchurch and the province of Canterbury by his great-great-grandfather, John Robert Godley. He took his seat in the House of Lords, but rarely attended until he made his maiden speech in 1961. He became an active member in later years. Originally a Liberal, he moved to Labour in 1966. As a resident in the Republic of Ireland, Lord Kilbracken returned his six military medals in 1972 as a result of British behaviour in Northern Ireland (variously attributed to the Bloody Sunday incident, or the British policy of internment). He also renounced his British nationality, taking up an Irish passport, but retaining his right to sit in the House of Lords until the reforms in 1999. He also campaigned on behalf of the Kurds, comparing the situation in Iraq with that in Northern Ireland.

It is preserved in five versions: one in Pali (Anguttara ii.37-30), one in the Gandharan Buddhist Texts and three in Chinese parallel translations (Taisho vol 2.717c, 2.28a and 2.467a). According to the Dona-sutta, the Buddha was once questioned by a brahmin called Dona, or Dhuma according to two of the Chinese versions. This brahmin comes across the Buddha's footprints and notices the wheel marks on the soles of his feet. Amazed by what he has seen, he follows them until he comes to where the Buddha is serenely seated. He then poses the Buddha certain questions. At this point, interpretation of the sutta in English language becomes somewhat controversial, since there is not a consensus regarding the proper English translation of the verb bhavissati, a key word used in Dona's questions. Translation of 'bhavissati' The Pali, Gandharan, and one of the Chinese versions (T II 467b8), report that the question of Dona was put in the future tense, in Pali this is the word bhavissati. In the other two Chinese versions the question of Dona is in the present tense, but it is acknowledged that all Chinese versions are a translation from earlier Indian versions of the Dona Sutta, which used the future tense. Thus the original Indian versions are believed to have all contained the question of Dona in the future tense, as in the Pali bhavissati. Literally translated, bhavissati refers to the future and means \\"will be, will become\\", but, according to a well-known Pali idiomatic usage, it can also be interpreted as an expression of uncertainty, confusion or amazement relating to the present. Thus, in some translations the bhavissati is literally translated as the future tense, so that the question posed by Dona pertains to what Buddha will be/become, asking whether he will be/become a god, a gandharva, a yaksha or a human. The Buddha answers these questions literally, saying that he will not be/become (na bhavissāmi) any of these beings [in the future], implying that since he is a Buddha he will not be reborn after this life. The Chinese translation at T II 467b8 follows this reasoning, and literally reads \\"I will not obtain human\\". The alternative translation is based on this possible idiomatic usage of the future tense in Pali, and understands the brahmin Dona to be asking the Buddha in confusion or amazement what he is—a god (deva), a gandharva, a yaksha or human. The Buddha answers emphatically that he is not any of these (na bhavissāmi), but that he is a Buddha. This reasoning is used in the Chinese translations of T 2.717c and T 2.28a. The idiomatic interpretation of bhavissati can also refer to some uncertainty which is present. Thus, a translation which would interpret the future tense as indicative of some uncertainty in the questioner, the question might be translated as \\"Whether the Buddha 'might' or 'would' be a god, a gandharva, a yaksha or a human\\". The answer would be put in the same way as the reply, giving the answer that \\"I might not be a god, gandharva, yaksha or human\\", or \\"I would not be a god, gandharva, yaksha or human\\", though this rendering is liable to other undesirable interpretations. Thus there are three possible translations: #I will not be a god, gandharva, yaksha or human. (future tense) #I am not a god, gandharva, yaksha or human. (present tense, not allowing uncertainty) #I might (or would) not be a god, gandharva, yaksha or human. (subjunctive, allowing uncertainty) As the early Indian versions (in Pali Canon and the Gandharan Buddhist Texts) are all formally in the future sense and only become formulated in present tense in one of the possible English translations, the first version is often used in Theravadin circles. While the Buddha in the second version states that he is a Buddha, and not a god or human, no philosophical conclusions are made explicit in this statement, while it suggests that a Buddha may belong to another category of being in nature, beyond the human and the divine, by virtue of his enlightenment and liberation. The third version may be put forward as an attempt to compromise between the first and second versions. Parallel versions Of the several Chinese parallel versions, the one contained in the Ekottara-āgama, attributed to the Mahāsānghikas, preserves a simpler, shorter and older form of this sutra. It treats Dona's questions as enquiries about the Buddha's present status, but omits the specific answer given by the Buddha, that he is a Buddha, found in all other versions. Here, the Buddha merely states that he knows that attachment and desire are the sources of the skandhas (the constituents of individual existence) and through that knowledge he has ended suffering. Thus, though the Mahāsānghikas are known to have espoused a form of docetism, the version of the Dona-sutta used by them does not imply that the Buddha is a transcendental being in human form, while the version preserved in Pali may be open to that interpretation.

He returned to his law practice until he was elected as an associate justice in the Vermont Supreme Court in 1870, succeeding William C. Wilson. He was appointed chief justice in 1882, succeeding John Pierpoint, and John W. Rowell was appointed to the resulting associate justice vacancy. Royce served as chief justice until 1890, when he resigned. Royce died in St. Albans, and is interred in Calvary Cemetery, East Berkshire. References Sources  Crockett, Walter Hill.

Tanner, lyrics by Adrian Ross and Percy Greenbank, and additional numbers by Paul Rubens. The story concerns marital mix-ups and the quest of a wealthy man for a $2,000 Peruvian orchid to be sent to France. When foul play keeps the flower from reaching its destination, it is discovered that a nearly identical orchid is growing in the garden of the horticultural college. The musical opened on 26 October 1903 at London's Gaiety Theatre and ran for 559 performances. It starred Gertie Millar, Gabrielle Ray, Harry Grattan, Edmund Payne and George Grossmith, Jr. The show also had a successful Broadway run, revivals and a U.S. tour.Howarth, Paul. \\"The Orchid\\", The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 4 February 2017 The Orchid was the first show produced at the renovated Gaiety Theatre.The Orchid, The Play Pictorial, Vol. 4, No. XIX, pp. 1 et seq.

Some of the show's most successful songs were \\"Liza Ann\\", \\"Little Mary\\", \\"Pushful\\" and \\"Fancy Dress\\". Synopsis Guy Scrymgeour is in love with Josephine Zaccary, but their union is opposed by his uncle, the rich and influential Mr. Chesterton, because she is the daughter of a mere orchid hunter. Meanwhile, a penniless young physician, Ronald Fausset, loves Lady Violet Anstruther. The two couples wed secretly, but the Registrar switches the names on the marriage certificates, so that Guy is joined to Lady Violet, and Ronald to Josephine. Chesterton founds a horticultural college and sends Zaccary (Josephine's father) to Peru to seek a special $2,000 orchid, the orchid of his dreams. Zaccary is supposed to take the flower to Nice, France, for a competitive exhibition. However, Zaccary is unreliable and goes to Paris instead, in search of flowers of the human variety. Fortunately, it is discovered that Meakin, the gardener at the horticultural college, is growing a nearly identical orchid.

On 13 August 1943 it flew its first operational sortie, a bombing raid across the Alps to Milan, Italy. In May 1944 the unit received Halifax Mk IIIs to replace its Mk Vs. The squadron was adopted by the Rotary Club of Halifax, Nova Scotia and to show its connection to the city adopted the nickname \\"Bluenose Squadron\\", the common nickname for people from Nova Scotia and a tribute to the schooner Bluenose; an image of the schooner appeared on the squadron badge. The squadron moved to RAF Croft in December 1943 and re-equipped with Avro Lancaster Mk Is and Mk Xs in December 1944. After VE Day the squadron was earmarked for Tiger Force to carry on the war against Japan, but was never deployed to the Far East. The unit was disbanded at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia on 5 September 1945. During World War II the unit flew 198 missions, including 179 bombing, 17 mine laying, one diversionary and one sea search.

He appeared as Scabior in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 and Part 2.  Early life  Moran was born in the East End of London, to a hairdresser mother and an Automobile Association worker father. He grew up on the South Oxhey council estate near Watford and the Greater London boundary.  Career   Film  Moran first hit film appearance was in 1990 alongside Roger Daltrey and Chesney Hawkes, in Buddy's Song (1990). His first lead role was later that year, in Vera Neubauer's Don't Be Afraid (1990).

In Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998), he shared the screen with Jason Statham, Dexter Fletcher, Jason Flemyng, Vinnie Jones and British rocker Sting, who played the role of his father, JD. Moran co-starred with John Hurt in New Blood (1999), and also starred with Joseph Fiennes, Sadie Frost and Tara FitzGerald in Rancid Aluminium (2000). In 2001, he played the role of Aramis in The Musketeer, a film loosely based on Alexandre Dumas, père's classic novel, The Three Musketeers. The film co-starred Catherine Deneuve, Tim Roth, Mena Suvari, Stephen Rea and Bill Treacher, with Justin Chambers in the role of D'Artagnan. After his directorial début in Telstar, Moran went on to film The Kid, an adaptation of Kevin Lewis's book of the same name. The film was released in 2010 and stars Rupert Friend, Ioan Gruffudd, Natascha McElhone and Liam Cunningham.

This was the play's West End début after a successful small-scale National Tour that featured stars such as Linda Robson, Adam Rickitt and Con O'Neill. A screen adaptation of the play, directed by Moran, was released in 2009. Con O'Neill reprised his stage role as Meek; Kevin Spacey played his financier, Major Banks. Moran also starred in the lead role of 'Roaring Trade' at Park Theatre in October 2015.

Biography Louise Imogen Guiney Photograph by Fred Holland Day (1893). The daughter of Gen. Patrick R. Guiney, an Irish-born American Civil War officer and lawyer,The American Magazine, Vol 8 (1888) and Jeannette Margaret Doyle, she was raised as a Christian and educated at the Notre Dame convent school in Boston and at the Academy of the Sacred Heart in Providence, Rhode Island, from which she graduated in 1879. Over the next 20 years, she worked at various jobs, including serving as a postmistress and working in the field of cataloging at the Boston Public Library. She was a member of several literary and social clubs, and according to her friend Ralph Adams Cram was \\"the most vital and creative personal influence\\" on their circle of writers and artists in Boston (see Visionists). In 1901, Guiney moved to Oxford, England, to focus on her poetry and essay writing. She gave a crucifix sculpture to the church of St Mary and St Nicholas, Littlemore, to mark the centenary of Cardinal Newman's birth in 1901. She soon began to suffer from illness and was no longer able to write poetry. She was a contributor to The Atlantic Monthly, Scribner's Magazine, McClure's, Blackwood's Magazine, Dublin Review, The Catholic World, and the Catholic Encyclopedia.Guiney, Louise Imogen. \\"Geoffrey Chaucer.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 12 June 2019 With Gwenllian Morgan, Guiney prepared materials for an edition and biography of the seventeenth-century Welsh poet Henry Vaughan. Neither Guiney nor Morgan lived to complete the project, however, and their research was used by F. E. Hutchinson for his 1947 biography _Henry Vaughan_. Guiney died of a stroke near Gloucestershire, England, at age 59, leaving much of her work unfinished.

Tanner, lyrics by Adrian Ross and Percy Greenbank, and music by Lionel Monckton. In its story, The Quaker Girl contrasts dour Quaker morality with Parisienne high fashion. The protagonist, Prudence, is thrown out of her house by her quaker parents for drinking a glass of champagne. Later, in Paris, her simple grey dress and bonnet become the height of fashion. The musical opened at the Adelphi Theatre in London on 5 November 1910 and ran for an extremely successful 536 performances. It starred Gertie Millar and C. Hayden Coffin. Phyllis Dare starred in the Paris production in 1911. It then opened at the Park Theatre on Broadway on 23 October 1911, running for a successful 240 performances. A revised version was produced at the London Coliseum on 25 May 1944, but the run was interrupted by bombing. The piece then toured the British provinces and soon re-opened in London at the Stoll Theatre in February, 1945, followed by extensive touring until December, 1948. The piece was popular with amateur theatre groups, particularly in Britain, from the 1920s until 1990, receiving over 250 UK productions during that period, but it has been produced only sporadically since then.Bond, Ian. \\"Rarely Performed Shows\\".

A mysterious young French lady and her not-too-bright maid Phoebe arrive to stay at Mrs. Lukyn's hotel. The lady turns out to be the exiled Princess Mathilde of France (\\"O, Time, Time\\"). She is followed by Captain Charteris, whom she intends to marry in the village church despite her previous engagement to Prince Carlo. Charteris has his best man with him, Tony Chute, of the American Embassy in Paris, as well as Madame Blum, a famous Parisian dressmaker. Prudence Pym, the niece of Nathaniel and Rachel, longs for a more exciting life and someone to love (\\"A Quaker Girl\\"). She meets Tony, and they are attracted to one another. Madame Blum, struck by Prudence's charmingly simple grey Quaker dress, tries to persuade her to accompany her back to Paris (\\"Tip Toe\\"). The marriage ceremony between the princess and Charteris takes place, and Prudence, carried away by the gaiety of the scene, is induced to take a sip of champagne. At this moment, with the wine to her lips, her aunt and uncle and the other Quakers appear on the scene. They sternly command her to leave these sinful people. Prudence decides to leave the dull life behind and to follow Madame Blum and the princess to Paris. She is disowned by her family. ;Act II Employed as a mannequin in Madame Blum's establishment in Paris, Prudence's simple costume becomes all the rage among the women, and she herself becomes extremely popular with the young men, including Prince Carlo (who had been engaged to Princess Mathilde) and Monsieur Duhamel, a distinguished government minister. This attention is most unwelcome to Tony Chute, who still has feelings for Prudence. The princess is disguised as one of Madame Blum's work girls, since she has been exiled for being a Bonapartiste. Tony's ex-girlfriend, Diane, a mercurial French actress, conspires to interfere with Tony and Prudence's budding romance. She has love letters from Duhamel, Carlo and Tony and intends to give Prudence the letters from Tony. At a costume fitting where Prudence is modeling a dress, Diane slips the letters into Prudence's pocket. But she inadvertently passes along Duhamel's letters, instead of Tony's. Prince Carlo invites Prudence and all of Blum's employees to a Ball (\\"Come to the Ball\\"), but Tony, knowing the Prince's reputation as a seducer, begs Prudence not to go. Prudence promises, and she receives her first kiss. Princess Mathilde is being pursued by the Monsieur Larose, the dogged Chief of Police, and the Prince has recognized Princess Mathilde. He threatens to reveal her identity to Larose unless Prudence accompanies him to the ball. For the sake of Mathilde, Prudence reluctantly agrees, breaking her promise to Tony. Tony is furious, believing her to be unfaithful. ;Act III At the lavish ball, Prudence, evading the prince, finds herself alone with her other suitor, Duhamel. She confronts him with his love letters showing that he has not been faithful to her. Duhamel assumes she is trying to blackmail him into letting Mathide stay in France, but Prudence tells him that she merely wants to return the letters to their rightful owner. Ashamed of his suspicion, and humbled by her simple honesty, Duhamel agrees to allow Mathilde to remain in Paris. Tony now learns the true story, and he begs forgiveness for having doubted her. All ends happily, with Prudence accompanying him back to the New World.

Its western point is located near the village of Merrimac on State Highway 113. The eastern point is located in Okee, Wisconsin. The Merrimac Ferry is both a functional regional crossing and a tourist attraction. There are snack bars at queue areas on either side of the river, and an ice cream stand on the north. It is the state's only free ferry, as well as the only ferry left on the Wisconsin State Trunk Highway System. The ferry is close to the head of Lake Wisconsin, as well as regional recreation areas, including Devil's Lake and Wisconsin Dells. Peak traffic coincides with the tourist season and weekend getaway schedules. Operations Cars drive onto the ferry from the landing in Merrimac in July 2015 Western docks in winter Concessions stand at western dock The ferryboat is named the Colsac III. \\"Colsac\\" is a portmanteau of Columbia and Sauk, the two counties connected by the ferry. The ferry operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, but only from April to November. The ferry will often operate into December depending on when the Lake Wisconsin ice becomes too thick to operate the ferry. The ferry winches itself across the river on three submerged cables. A round trip usually takes 14 minutes. Colsac III can hold up to fifteen normal-size cars or trucks, as well as bicycles and pedestrians, and is capable of transporting semi-trailers. The state operates warning signs several miles from the ferry to alert motorists when it is not operating in season, as detours are considerable, and a traffic information system provides drivers with the expected wait time, which can be up to 50 minutes in peak season. Traffic volume can exceed 1200 vehicles daily. History In 1844, Chester Mattson obtained a charter to provide ferry service at the present-day location. The ferry was in operation long before there was a marked road leading to or away from it. According to conflicting sources, Mattson charged either 35 cents or $1 to ferry a team and wagon across the river. The ferry was human-powered until around the turn of the century, when the first gasoline engine was added. The State of Wisconsin took over the ferry as part of the state highway system in 1933, with operation and maintenance performed by the Columbia County Department of Transportation. The toll was eliminated. The wooden ferry then in service, the first Colsac, had a capacity of eight cars. It was replaced by the Colsac II in 1963, with a capacity of twelve cars. The state has periodically considered a bridge to increase the capacity of the state highway and ease commuting for local residents. (The ferry is just west of a 19th-century Wisconsin and Southern Railroad bridge.) As the Colsac II aged, periodic maintenance both grew expensive and took the ferry out of commission for weeks at a time. The older boat's capacity was also frequently strained during the peak travel season, and weight limitations restricted truck traffic. The ferry remained popular with tourists and the tourist industry. Supporters of the ferry won out, the bridge proposal was shelved, and the ferry was upgraded. The latest, modern-day ferry was launched on May 16, 2003. It cost $2.2 million to build and was dedicated to sitting Governor Jim Doyle. The new boat was an embarrassment its first season, though, spending several weeks out of commission. The state eventually sued the boat builder. The state was unsuccessful in its attempt to sell the retired ferry, the Colsac II, using an Internet auction, so the boat was eventually sold for scrap.

Military career before 1979 An ethnic Lango, Oyite Ojok was born on 15 April 1940. Although there are few documented details regarding David Oyite Ojok's early years, he was initially noted in his late twenties as a junior army officer serving during the 1966–71 period of President Milton Obote's first government. Oyite-Ojok joined the Uganda Army in 1963. He was transferred from 1st Battalion to 4th Battalion on 7 February 1966 at Shaban Opolot's orders.Omii Omara-Otunnu, Politics and the Military in Uganda 1890–1985, p. 75, citing General and Administrative Order 9/1966. However at the end of February 1966 he was transferred to Army Headquarters and made Deputy Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster General. In September 1970, while Idi Amin was out of the country serving as the Ugandan representative at the funeral of President Nasser of Egypt, Obote appointed a new Chief of Defence Staff (Brigadier Suleman Hussein).Omara-Otunnu, 1987, 89. Oyite-Ojok was one of President Obote's most important followers in the military, and was described by Omara-Otunnu as 'Obote's principal military confidant' was appointed to the '..newly created post of Assistant Military Secretary in the Ministry of Defence,' serving as a Major. His duties included '..planning, all policy matters, and control of Establishment.' At some point, he was sent for training to Great Britain. By 1971, Oyite-Ojok served as lieutenant colonel, but was forced to flee his home country when Idi Amin overthrew Obote in a coup. Relocating to Tanzania, Oyite-Ojok joined the guerrilla army Obote was organizing to regain power. While operating in exile, Oyite-Ojok gradually gained a \\"legendary\\" reputation in Uganda. Rumours circulated about him sneaking into the Ugandan capital where he would party with locals at popular nightspots and ask that the bills be sent to President Amin. The latter allegedly responded by putting a $70,000 bounty on Oyite-Ojok's head. Amin's army invaded Tanzania in late 1978, resulting in the Uganda–Tanzania War's outbreak. Oyite-Ojok assumed a key role in the grouping of military exiles who, with the backing of Tanzanian troops, led the counteroffensive which resulted in the overthrow of Amin. At first, he served as field commander for Obote's private army Kikosi Maalum, and was appointed head of a Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA) battalion in March 1979. With the latter unit, he fought alongside the Tanzanians in central and eastern Uganda. Oyite-Ojok proved to be tactically adept during this conflict. He eventually rose to chief of staff for the entire UNLA. Oyite-Ojok's reputation grew immensely during the Uganda–Tanzania War. Some people, including Tito Okello, attributed the Tanzanian victories in the Battle of Lukaya and the Fall of Kampala to his leadership. Transition period Oyite Ojok became a member, along with Yoweri Museveni, Paulo Muwanga and Tito Okello, of the Military Commission, a powerful sub-committee of the Uganda National Liberation Front (UNLF) which ruled the country after Idi Amin's overthrow. Like most people in power after the fall of Amin, Oyite-Ojok illegally amassed a great amount of wealth. One of his most successful business ventures was coffee export, and he became chairmain of the Coffee Making Board. He remained loyal to Obote who was preparing to return from exile. The alliance of political forces in the UNLF under President Yusuf Lule soon began to unravel. Of significant importance was the emergence of tribal rivalry. On the one side were those from the North who made up the bulk of the new national army, and on the other those from the South (particularly those from the Buganda tribe) who for the first time since 1964 had significant political and military influence. As chief of staff of the UNLA in its new role as Uganda's national army, Oyite Ojok was supposed to stay neutral and above the political disputes. Instead of doing so, Oyite Ojok fully backed Obote. He ensured that the national army under his command was overwhelmingly made up of Northerners, such as himself. The political symbol for most of those from Northern Uganda was the Uganda Peoples Congress party and Obote, who was still in Tanzanian exile. Obote's possible return was opposed by many within the UNLF, particularly those from Buganda who recalled that it was Obote who had dethroned their King (the Kabaka of Buganda) and forced him into exile in 1966. It is widely believed that it was this opposition to Obote's return and the growing influence of the northern dominated army that led to the removal of Yusuf Lule from the Presidency after only 2 months in office. Lule had also tried to extend his very limited presidential powers in the UNLF. Lule was replaced by another Muganda, Godfrey Binaisa who was seen as more of a figurehead. Real power now lay with Oyite Ojok and the Military Commission. The UNLF became more militaristic in appearance as army officers like Ojok became actively involved in politics, and the quasi-legislative National Commission and government ministers became less significant. On the ground the army became more brutal, particularly in Buganda and other areas of Southern Uganda. Most significantly, the Uganda Peoples Congress with its military allies began to actively organise and call for the return of Obote. In May 1980, Oyite Ojok gained greater power when \\"figurehead president\\" Binaisa dismissed him as army chief in an attempt to reduce the power of the Military Commission. In response the Military Commission removed Binaisa from office and declared the country would be ruled by a Presidential Commission which included Muwanga, Museveni, Oyite Ojok and Okello. Although as chairman, Muwanga presented the face of the Commission, real power was held by Oyite Ojok. Meanwhile, Oyite-Ojok also organized his personal death squad led by his trusted follower Captain Patrick Ageta. This 30-strong squad roamed Kampala in two jeeps, and murdered several political opponents of the chief of staff. Return of Milton Obote The Presidential Commission now paved the way for the return of Obote and organised what an general election in December 1980. Oyite-Ojok campaigned on behalf of Obote, using his status as \\"legendary commander\\" to rally northerners to his cause. Firmly rooted in tribalist ideas, the officer believed that the elections would decide which ethnic group controlled Uganda's wealth. Researcher Opiyo Oloya argued that this \\"was the game as [Oyite-Ojok] saw and played it\\". Despite being an ethnic Lango, Oyite Ojok managed to gain the support of many traditionally marginalised Acholi people. The 1980 elections resulted in \\"victory\\" for Obote's Uganda Peoples Congress and Obote became president for the second time, confirming Oyite-Ojok as Army Chief of Staff. Museveni, who had formed a rival political party, the Uganda Patriotic Front, disputed the result and started a guerrilla war against the government. As Army Chief of Staff, Oyite Ojok was responsible for attempting to defeat the guerrilla armies of Museveni's National Resistance Movement (NRA) and Andrew Kayiira's Uganda Freedom Movement (UFM) which were fighting to overthrow Obote's government. With his military experience during the struggle to overthrow Idi Amin, Oyite Ojok proved very effective against these groups. However this was done with both military tact and brutality against the population in areas where the guerrilla forces operated. This was most prevalent in the Luwero District where the NRA was active and in the capital city, Kampala where the UFM was based. In Luwero, thousands of civilians were killed by the army – especially in an area called the 'Luwero Triangle'. In Kampala, the army and secret police carried out numerous random arrests which often involved arresting hundreds of people and loading them onto trucks which were then driven to army barracks. This phenomenon was called \\"Panda Gari\\" (\\"Climb the Truck\\") and it instilled widespread fear in the capital as many of those taken to army barracks were beaten or killed. The NRA and UFM had adopted different tactics. The UFM preferred to operate in urban areas like Kampala and carried out spectacular attacks on government installations. This however left them vulnerable to counterattacks from the army which would simply cordon off a suburb and brutalise its residents until the guerrillas were revealed. This climate of fear plus the UFM's lack of a credible political ethos meant Oyite Ojok's army had effectively defeated them in 2 years. The NRA preferred the rural areas and fought a bush war which involved hit and run tactics against army patrols and vehicles. Museveni also developed a very effective political wing and vision. Having mostly defeated the UFM, Oyite Ojok concentrated his efforts in Luwero and had measured success against the NRA. It is widely believed that by early 1983, Museveni had departed for Sweden, leaving in place, however, the military and political organisation of the NRA. The war with the NRA eventually began to crack the military and brought to fore rivalry between the two northern tribes that dominated the army -the Langi (Obote and Oyite Ojok's tribe) and the Acholi (Tito Okello – the Army Commander's tribe). The majority of the army foot soldiers were Acholi and it was they who suffered most casualties in the war, and it is rumoured that they wanted to engage in peace talks with the guerrillas. Meanwhile, the elite Special Forces and most of the officers closest to Obote were Langi – and were fiercely opposed to any negotiations with the NRA. This rivalry came to a head at the time of Oyite-Ojok's fatal crash in December. Aftermath In the decades following the helicopter crash which ended David Oyite Ojok's life at the age of 43, documented details have not been made public. The political ramifications for Uganda, however, were severe. Acholi officers now expected Obote to appoint an Acholi to replace Oyite Ojok. One obvious candidate, Bazilio Olara-Okello who, although unrelated to Tito Okello, was, as in the case of Oyite Ojok, another officer who participated in the overthrow of Idi Amin. Obote, nevertheless, appointed a junior Langi officer, Smith Apon-Achak. This further alienated the Acholi officers who overthrew Obote's government two years later.

Andrew Lang included it in The Crimson Fairy Book.Andrew Lang, The Crimson Fairy Book, \\"The Gold-bearded Man\\" Synopsis A dying king asked of his queen that she would never remarry, but rather devote the rest of her life to caring for their only son. She promised to do as he requested, but no sooner was her husband dead than she remarried and had her new husband made king instead of her son. The stepfather was a wicked man and treated his stepson very cruelly. By the castle, there was a brook that was of milk rather than water, which had plenty for everyone, but the new king forbade anyone to take the milk. The guards noticed a gold-bearded man taking buckets of milk in the morning and then strangely vanishing. The king came to see. He wondered if he could ever capture such a man, and many attempts failed. One day, an old soldier told him to leave bread, bacon, and drugged wine for the man; he would eat, drink, and fall asleep. Then they could catch him. The plan succeeded, and the king put the man in a cage. After a month had passed, the king had to go to war. He told his stepson to feed the man but not free him, or his fate would be terrible. The prince accidentally shot an arrow into the cage, and the gold-bearded man refused to give it back unless he freed him. After much pleading, the prince was convinced. The gold-bearded man promised to repay him a thousand-fold and vanished. The prince decided that running away could not be more dangerous than staying and left. As he went along, he met a wood dove. He was on the verge of shooting it when it implored him not to because its two children would starve. He spared it, and the dove said that because of his act of mercy it would find a way to repay him. The prince continued on, eventually meeting with a duck and then later a stork. Both times the same thing happened as had with the wood dove. He met with two soldiers, and they traveled together in search of work. A king hired the soldiers as coachmen and the prince as his companion. The jealous soldiers told him the prince had claimed that if he were made the king's steward, he could ensure that no grain was lost from the king's store; if he set the prince to separate wheat and barley, it would show what his boasting was worth. The king had two enormous sacks mixed and ordered the prince to separate them. The wood dove, who was the king of the wood doves, had his fellow doves sort them. The king appointed him steward. This made the soldiers more jealous. They then told the king that the prince had claimed that were he in charge of the royal treasures, he would ensure that none were lost; if the king had a ring from the princess's finger thrown in the stream, it would show what his boasting was worth. The king did so, and the duck, who was the king of the ducks, had his ducks find it. The king appointed him in charge of his treasures. The soldiers now claimed that the prince had said he knew of a child who could speak every language and play every musical instrument. The king thought this was magic, which he had tried to learn, and ordered the prince to produce the child, as a third task or be dragged to death. The stork brought the child to him. The king married him to his daughter, and asked how he had done it. The prince told him, and the king had the soldiers driven away with whips.

He served as head of the National Directorate of Security (NDS), which is the domestic intelligence agency of Afghanistan. Before his appointment as the head of the NDS in September 2012, Khalid served as the Minister of Tribal and Border Affairs. Between 2005 and 2008, he was the Governor of Kandahar Province and prior to that as Governor of Ghazni Province (2002-2005). Khalid is said to be affiliated with the Islamic Dawah Organisation of Afghanistan (Ittihad-i Islami) and has been noted as one of many loyalists of Afghan President Hamid Karzai. Biography Haji Asadullah Khalid was born in the Ghazni Province of Afghanistan on 10 June 1970 into a Taraki Ghilzai Pashtun family. His father served as an MP during the reign of the king Zaher Shah while in later days his uncle became a known Ittihad-i Islami commander. Asadullah Khalid himself became affiliated with the Ittihad party and its leader Abdul Rab Rasul Sayyaf. During the rule of the Taliban (1996-2001), Khalid served with the anti-Taliban resistance as part of the Ittihad faction. The Afghanistan Analyst Network writes that Khalid may have recovered \\"Stinger missiles on behalf of Ittihad’s boss, Sayyaf\\", which may have brought him into first direct contacts with the CIA. Khalid's personal account of that time is that he studied law in Tajikistan. After the fall of the Taliban regime, Khalid worked with the National Directorate of Security, Department 5, but shortly afterwards became Governor of his home Ghazni province, a post he held until 2005. After a re-shuffle in 2005 by President Hamid Karzai, Khalid was shifted from Ghazni province to become the new governor of Kandahar province. As governor, he said that he believed in the coordination of international and national efforts in bringing stability to Afghanistan.\\"Civilians reported killed by airstrikes as NATO hunts Taliban\\" October 19, 2006 accessed 19 October 2006. Asadullah Khalid is standing in the back row praying to Allah at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan In early 2007, Asadullah Khalid escaped an assassination attempt. He was targeted by a Taliban suicide bomber. His motorcade was destroyed but he survived with only minor injuries.CBSNEWS, Suicide car bomber rams Kandahar governor's SUV Mr. Khalid was appointed as Minister of Borders, ethnics and tribal Affairs in 2008. In 2011, besides being in-charge of the Ministry, he was appointed as special representative of the President to Loy Kandahar provinces (i.e. Kandahar, Helmand, Zabul, and Urozgan). As a trusted envoy of the president ( Hamid Karzai ) and security expert, he brought stability and peace to South Western provinces in short while. In October 2011 Khalid survived another attempt on his life. A year later, in September 2012, the National Assembly of Afghanistan approved him as head of the National Directorate of Security (NDS), which is the Afghan intelligence service. It is very similar to that of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from which it receives training and support. To eradicate Taliban and confront them in the gross-roots he implemented many concepts, beside his other attempts he created and supported the anti-Taliban uprisings in insurgent-held areas of eastern Afghanistan, and often accused the Pakistani intelligence services of fomenting the insurgency. A few months later, on 6 December 2012, Khalid became injured during a failed Taliban assassination attempt in Kabul. The incident happened in the Taymeni area of the city, inside one of the many guesthouses that NDS uses in Kabul to reduce the risk of an attack. Afghan officials said that Khalid needed blood transfusions, but President Hamid Karzai said Khalid \\"is doing well\\" and described the attack as \\"a cowardly act of terrorism\\". The attacker posed as a \\"peace messenger\\" arrived from Quetta, Pakistan, and was used by the Taliban's Quetta Shura, which is guided by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). The death of Burhanuddin Rabbani in Kabul occurred the same exact way and that attack was tied to Taliban's Quetta Shura. Zabiullah Mujahid, who is based in Pakistan, confirmed that the Taliban were behind the attack. Politicians in Afghanistan, including the President and members of the Parliament, accused elements in Pakistan of organizing Khalid's assassination attempt.for wounds from a Taliban assassination attempt In June 2013, Khalid returned to US for further medical treatment after his conditions deteriorated for wounds from the Taliban assassination attempted in December 2012.\\"Afghan spy chief quietly returns to US for medical treatment\\" - McClatchy Newspaper - May 2, 2013 accessed June 8, 2013.

In 2009, Richard Colvin, a former Canadian deputy ambassador to Afghanistan who worked closely with Khalid, testified before the Canadian parliament that Khalid was directly involved in torture. He said that Khalid was controlling a criminal gang and he had people killed who got in his way. In April 2010, CBC News revealed the existence of top- level Canadian government documents reporting the personal involvement of Khalid in serious human rights abuses in his own private dungeon. Multiple sources report that the private detention centre was located under Khalid's guest house while he was the governor of Kandahar. The documents also showed that Christopher Alexander, a top Canadian official working with the United Nations, alleged that Asadullah Khalid had ordered the killing of five United Nations workers by bombing, presumably to protect his narcotics interests. Graeme Smith from The Globe and Mail conducted an investigation on Brigade 888 (a unit under the direct command of Khalid) and found that Khalid's governor palace contained private detention centres. Graeme Smith further said that the Canadian Generals knew about the brutal technique employed to torture the detainees in those cells. A source from Afghanistan said that the palace hired a labourer every few weeks to apply fresh paint to the interrogation room. This was done to conceal blood on the walls. The source also reported the presence of other informal cells in the city which are operated by Khalid. Khalid was also accused being involved in act of sexual violence against the women and the girls. Human Right Watch stated that there is a 'strong evidence' which suggests that Khalid was involved in act of sexual violence against women and girls, when he was governor of Ghazni and Kandahar. Khalid allegedly threatened the victims with consequences if they told anyone about what happened. Drug smuggling Asadullah Khalid was also accused of being involved in drug trafficking. Kabul Press in 2009, while citing several sources from the Afghan presidential palace, described Khalid as \\"the most crucial member of a narcotics producing and smuggling syndicate\\". Khaled Monawar, during his tenure as Afghanistan's permanent representative to the United Nations in Vienna in 2007, said that Khalid had no plan to eradicate opium from the province and neither was he interested to follow the existing plan.

Rideau Ferry straddles a narrow stretch of water joining the Big Rideau Lake to the Lower Rideau Lake. At Rideau Ferry, the south shore of the Rideau Waterway is located within the Township of Rideau Lakes in Leeds and Grenville County, and the north shore is located within the township of Drummond/North Elmsley in Lanark County.  History  Despite the name of the community, there is no ferry service operating at Rideau Ferry in the present day. A bridge was constructed to allow passage across the Rideau in 1874, allowing travellers from Brockville or Kingston to more easily cross the Rideau to travel to Perth. Rideau Ferry was originally known as Oliver's Ferry after John Oliver, a Scottish settler in South Elmsley township (now part of Rideau Lakes), who settled here in 1816 and started a ferry service across this narrow section of Rideau Lake. According to local legend, Mr. Oliver was said to have an unusual habit of refusing to transport passengers after dark, instead putting them up in his house for the night. His neighbours, though, never saw the travellers in the morning. Several of the travellers did not arrive at their intended destination and were thought to be victims of highway robbery. Years later, when Oliver's house was torn down to allow a bridge to be built, human skeletons were found in the walls and under the floorboards of additions Oliver had made to the original house.Rideau Canal - Friends of the Rideau - History of the Rideau Although later found to be untrue, this story persists as a local legend.Skeletons Under the Floor - The Story of Oliver's Ferry In the 1890s, a number of summer homes and cottages were established along the south shore of the Lower Rideau Lake, many of which remain with the same families today.Township of Rideau Lakes, Heritage - Rideau Ferry  Services and Attractions  The Rideau Ferry Conservation Area was established along a shoreline property on the Lower Rideau Lake.

In June 2016, she moved to One America News Network as their senior political correspondent. In August 2020, Miller, who had no previous science or medical experience, was appointed as Assistant Commissioner for Media Affairs for the Food and Drug Administration, including being their top spokesperson, a role usually performed by non-political civil servants. Two weeks later, she was dismissed from the position abruptly, reportedly due to repeated clashes with the Agency's staff and a lack of aptitude for communicating in the medical and scientific field.https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/28/fda-top- spokesperson-leaves-404422  Controversies   Colin Powell interview  In 2004, while working as deputy press secretary to Secretary of State Colin Powell, Miller was criticized when she attempted to abruptly end an interview he was giving to Meet the Press. She instructed the cameraman to stop filming Powell, although Powell finished the interview after instructing Miller to allow him to continue. A spokesman for the State Department later defended Miller, saying that she had ended the interview because it had run long despite her \\"[making] every attempt to get NBC to finish up\\".  Role in Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal  Miller received heavy news coverage in 2006 in connection to the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal after cooperating with FBI prosecutors who asked her about illegal activities committed by her ex- fiancé Michael Scanlon. Scanlon in turn went on to assist with the investigation of Jack Abramoff, who was his former business partner. Miller was originally blamed as the first whistleblower in the scandal, although it later became clear that it was Tom Rodgers who exposed the fraud. Miller and some others have criticized the media for portraying her as a jilted ex-fiancé who decided to expose Scanlon as revenge when he called off their engagement. In a 2009 interview with Howard Kurtz, Miller said that this portrayal was inaccurate, and described her difficulty escaping it. She also discussed contacting director George Hickenlooper and actor Kevin Spacey to try to be removed from the film Casino Jack, a 2010 comedy based on the Abramoff scandal in which she is portrayed by Rachelle Lefevre. She criticized the film for inaccurately portraying her as \\"a bitch,... materialistic,... bad in bed,... [and] abetting a federal crime\\".  Home invasion  Miller has described herself as a victim of a home invasion several times, including in a speech at a gun lobbyist event and in a reenactment produced by NRA All Access. In a column in The Washington Times, and in her book Emily Gets Her Gun: But Obama Wants to Take Yours, she recounted the event as an outdoors encounter with a burglar who was leaving the home as she returned. In 2015, Erik Wemple of The Washington Post published several articles criticizing Miller for her inconsistent retellings of the incident, and highlighting discrepancies between her descriptions and police reports. Wemple accused her of exaggerating the story to advance her career as a gun lobbyist, saying \\"Nothing animates lobbying pushes quite like the story of a criminal invading the home of a law-abiding citizen.\\" References Living people American media personalities American women journalists United States congressional aides Georgetown University alumni Writers from Baltimore People associated with the Jack Abramoff scandals Maryland Republicans American women non-fiction writers American gun rights activists 21st- century American journalists 21st-century American non-fiction writers 21st-century American women writers The Washington Times people United States Department of State officials Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Emily J.

The airline was in service between 1993 and 1996. History Originally announced in late 1991, Arizona Airways envisioned to create 165 jobs and generate $70 million to the local economy. In March 1992, the carrier was given its FAA approval. After it was given approval, service was initially to commence in June 1992, with three roundtrips each business day and two each on Saturday and Sunday between Tucson and San Diego. By July 1992, the U.S. Department of Transportation awarded the airline a route from Tucson to Hermosillo. At the time of this announcement, the airline also stated it was considering flying all of its domestic flights out of Avra Valley Airport in neighboring Marana due to the higher gate fees at Tucson International Airport; however, these plans never materialized. Growth of the airline was rapid in its first year resulting in the carrier offering more flights from Tucson than any other carrier by April 1994. However, by July 1995 the carrier was unable to pay its fees at the airport and sought out an alliance with Minneapolis-based Great Lakes Aviation to generate additional revenue. In August 1995, the deal with Great Lakes became official and the carrier was rebranded as Arizona Airways Express. The carrier was then merged into Great Lakes Airlines on January 15, 1996.

The play is based on the 1939 classic film of the same name.  Production history  The show opened on Broadway at the Imperial Theatre on April 23, 1959 and closed on June 18, 1960 after 472 performances. Michael Kidd was the director and choreographer. The cast starred Andy Griffith as Destry and Dolores Gray as Frenchy. The national tour starred John Raitt and Anne Jeffreys, while Yvonne De Carlo appeared in the show in such venues as the Paper Mill Playhouse and the Dallas Summer Musicals. The plot was loosely based on a story by Max Brand. The song made famous by Marlene Dietrich in the film, \\"See What the Boys in the Back Room Will Have\\", was not used in the stage production.  Synopsis   Act 1  The opening song (\\"Bottleneck\\") shows the roughness and violence of the town Bottleneck. Then, at the Last Chance Saloon, Frenchy and her girls perform for the male patrons of The Last Chance (\\"Ladies\\"). After the song, Clagget stomps into the bar with Sheriff Keogh. Clagget accuses Frenchy and Kent of stealing his ranch in a crooked poker game last night. Kent strides out calmly, greeting the sheriff. Kent states that he won and Clagget lost. Sheriff Keogh asks for them to go into his office. Kent, Gyp and Bugs Watson, and the sheriff go into Kent's office. Clagget angrily storms out of the saloon while Rockwell and Frenchy reveal that she did steal one of his aces. But in the middle of their laughter, a gunshot is heard and the laughing grinds to a halt. Kent and his gang come out, explaining that Gyp Watson's pistol had accidentally gone off. Slade tells Kent that shooting Keogh was a mistake and they were moving too fast. One of Kent's gang hands Slade the sheriff badge and Kent tells Slade that it was up to him to appoint a new sheriff. Slade makes an announcement to the patrons of the saloon that Sheriff Keogh has left town on urgent business and Washington Dimsdale would be taking his place. Wash tells the town that he'll bring law and order to the town with the help of Tom Destry (\\"Hoop De Dingle\\"). Tom Destry arrives in Bottleneck with a parasol and a canary cage. The townsmen don't think very highly of him and tease him, especially Kent's gang. Destry sees it as hospitality and tells the townspeople how shocked he is by their welcome (\\"Tomorrow Morning\\"). Destry meets Kent and Kent asks Destry for his gun. Destry reveals he doesn't own a gun. Wash is surprised that Destry doesn't have a gun. Destry meets Frenchy and Destry quickly angers her and a fight ensues in which Destry and Frenchy are pulled apart by Wash and Kent. Wash and Destry run out to a street and there, Wash confronts him about not owning a gun. Wash explains that the town had planned a big welcome party for him, but he didn't think Destry could face anyone now. Destry tells Wash that they won't need guns to bring law and order to Bottleneck. He tells Wash that guns will only bring death (\\"Ballad of the Gun\\"). Wash then swears Destry in as deputy and they head for the party. Meanwhile, Kent's gang are seen harassing two girls. They steal a banner they were carrying and see that there was to be a social in honor of Destry's arrival and they weren't invited. The gang then hurries off to tell Kent and Frenchy. In a corral, it shows that the party has already started (\\"The Social\\"). The townsfolk are seen dancing with each other until Kent and his gang crash the party and threaten the people with whips until Destry shows up and takes down Kent's gang. The town then gratefully thanks Destry and finish the social. At the end of the social, Destry thanks everyone for the party, until he is interrupted by Clagget, who is armed with a rifle. He is followed by his wife, who pleads that he put the gun down. Clagget proclaims that he won't put the gun down until he's killed Kent and his gang. Destry interferes, taking Clagget's rifle while they shook hands. Clagget explains that Kent put him and his wife off their ranch this morning. He retells the story of how he was cheated in the poker game. He also says a little bit about the former sheriff. A few of the other townsmen tell Destry that Kent also took their ranches through similar means. Destry reluctantly tells Clagget that there's nothing that he could do until there was more evidence. Clagget's wife snaps at Destry and the two leave. A gleeful Kent thanks Destry and leaves as well with his gang. The townspeople, who now despise Destry turn away from him. At Frenchy's house, Destry pays a visit to Frenchy. Frenchy then tries to use this opportunity to seduce Destry (\\"I Know Your Kind\\"). Destry politely tells Frenchy that he was on official business but Frenchy becomes angry anyway. Destry gets Frenchy to admit that she had something to do with the disappearance of Sheriff Keogh. She then threatens to throw a perfume bottle at Destry if he didn't leave. Destry leaves, and Clara enters and begins to talk about Destry. Frenchy shoos her out and fumes about Destry (\\"I Hate Him\\"). She finishes by smashing her brush into her mirror. At Rose Lovejoy's house, the men of Bottleneck admire Rose Lovejoy and her girls (\\"Paradise Alley\\"). Frenchy and Destry run into each other and Frenchy apologizes for what she did at her house. They try to be impersonal and impartial but fail (\\"Anyone Would Love You\\"). Destry then meets up with Wash and indirectly tells him that he's in love (\\"Once Knew a Fella\\"). Then Destry shows Wash important papers that Sheriff Keogh had left behind and Destry tells Wash that he's got a plan and they were going to catch the culprit tonight. The town then celebrates their \\"every once in a while\\" (\\"Every Once in a While\\"). The saloon is packed and Frenchy performs a song (\\"Fair Warning\\"). Destry whispers to Wash to follow Gyp Watson to see if he can lead them to the sheriff's body. Destry is then confronted by Kent, who tells Destry to stop investigating Keogh's disappearance. Destry refuses to and hints that he knows where the body is hidden. Kent then sends Gyp Watson to go and check if the body was still where they hid it. Wash follows Gyp and catches him red-handed with Sheriff Keogh's body. He arrests Gyp and tells Destry. Destry then announces to the town that Gyp Watson has been arrested for murder. Bugs Watson becomes furious, claiming that his brother didn't kill Sheriff Keogh. Kent then sends Frenchy to announce that Mayor Slade would by trying Gyp's case and the jury would be made up of patrons of the Last Chance Saloon. Wash disappointedly hands Destry two pistols and walks away.

Holladay went on to great fame and fortune as the “Stagecoach King,” running the stagecoach lines from Missouri to the West Coast that later became the Wells Fargo Express, and ultimately acquiring the Pony Express as well. He was a serial entrepreneur who owned saloons, hotels, and silver mines, and by 1864, he was the largest individual employer in the United States. In 1860, Holladay turned the distillery over to his brother, Major David Holladay, who then ran the Distillery until his death in 1894. His son-in-law, Thomas Barton, operated the distillery until it was sold to George Shawhan and became the Shawhan Distillery in 1900. During the period of Prohibition in the United States, the company remained open by bottling its previously distilled whisky for medicinal purposes.History section of McCormick Distilling Company website The distillery was sold to Isadore Singer in 1936, and was renamed as the Old Weston Distillery. Singer then purchased the McCormick brand name from a neighboring plant at Waldron, Missouri, and renamed the distillery McCormick Distilling Company in 1942. In 1950, the company was purchased by Cloud Cray of Midwest Grain Products. Business partners Ed Pechar and Mike Griesser purchased the company in 1992. Under Pechar and Griesser's ownership and management, McCormick Distilling expanded from 35 employees in 1992 to 186 employees in 2006. Griesser died in November, 2004. As of 2020, McCormick Distilling remains a privately held corporation owned by company chairman Ed Pechar, the estate of Mike Griesser, and a small group of employee partners who comprise the Board of Directors.Food and Drink News \\"McCormick Distilling drinks to the future.\\" Products 1.75L Bottle of McCormick Vodka *McCormick Vodka: According to the company, McCormick Vodka is the #2 selling American vodka in the world.

The shipper was suspected of having ties to some of the most powerful mob clans in Russia. Other distillers, brokers, and shippers around the United States were also reported to have been under investigation by U.S. authorities. McCormick was charged and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of making a false entry in regulatory documents, in which it identified the alcohol as non-drinkable products such as industrial cleaning solutions (thereby evading tax duties), and it agreed to pay $2 million in penalties and $1 million in reparations paid to the government of Ukraine, and accepted a one-week suspension of its license.

St Stephen's was originally on the corner of Bridge Street and the Embankment, in London SW1, now the location of Portcullis House. From 1962 it occupied a building at 34 Queen Anne's Gate, overlooking Birdcage Walk and St. James's Park. According to Charles Dickens, Jr., writing in 1879:Charles Dickens, Jr., Dickens's Dictionary of London (1879) History A dining room inside the club Taking its name from St Stephen's Chapel, the original meeting place of the Commons, the club was initially connected with Conservative Party Members of Parliament and civil engineers. Benjamin Disraeli, twice Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, was among the founding fathers. On 14 January 1886, six Irish Conservative MPs, led by Colonel E.J. Saunderson from County Cavan, met at the St. Stephen's Club to form a distinct Parliamentary Ulster party - what was to become the Ulster Unionist Party.Alvin Jackson, The Ulster Party, OUP, Oxford, 1989. P. 46 The original premises were sold to the government in the early 1960s and the club moved to 34 Queen Anne's Gate, the former private house of Lord Glenconner, in 1962. The club was reopened at Queen Anne's Gate by Harold Macmillan, then prime minister. Traditionally the Chairman of the Conservative Party was the club's president.

It became officially apolitical and operated as a private members' luncheon club and venue for evening functions. However, it retained an unofficial connection with the Conservative Party. Notably, on 7 May 2010, David Cameron chose the club as the venue to make the \\"big offer\\" to the Liberal Democrats for a coalition government which resulted in the coalition government under the leadership of David Cameron as Prime Minister and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg as Deputy Prime Minister. Lord McAlpine kept his London wine collection in the cellar. On 2 January 2013 the club closed due to lack of members and soaring running costs having struggled to attract new members due to the economic climate and changing attitudes to London Clubs.

Published in 2005, this was the first with Todd as sole author and the nineteenth in the series.. Retrieved 2011-10-09. Collaboration Todd's solo contribution followed two years after the first published collaboration between mother and son, Dragon's Kin. Although set only a decade later, Dragonsblood is not a sequel. During the next few years, the McCaffreys co-wrote two sequels to their Dragon's Kin and Todd completed two sequels to his Dragonsblood. Plot overview All of Todd's novels are set just before or at the beginning of the \\"Third Pass\\", about 500 years after human settlement on Pern (500 AL, \\"After Landing\\") and 2000 years before the \\"Ninth Pass\\" events chronicled in most of Anne McCaffrey's Pern books. Dragonsblood features an epidemic that strikes fire-lizards, probably first, and dragons (reptiloids). The people of Pern have regressed since its settlement by colonists from Earth and have already lost the knowledge and equipment to handle such a bio-medical crisis. In Moreta: Dragonlady of Pern (1983) and Nerilka's Story (1985), Anne McCaffrey had featured a plague that decimates humans and apparently passes among mammals. That happened 1000 years later in Pern history. Plot summary Occasional chapters of Dragonsblood are set soon after the end of the First Pass of the Red Star, nearly 450 years before most of the action. There (or then) the elderly Wind Blossom, a geneticist and daughter of the legendary Kitti Ping, is bemoaning the gradual loss of manufactured items and the technology to create them. She and her ex-protégé Tieran are startled by two fire-lizards who literally fall from the sky. One, a gold, dies upon arrival. They nurse the other one, a bronze, back to health, using the last of the antibiotics. Not knowing if the fire-lizard's sickness is contagious, they quarantine it until it recovers. Tieran adopts the fire lizard and names him Grenn – the name found on the harness he was wearing. Further investigation of the decorations on Grenn's harness leads to the incredible conclusion that he is from the future. Since fire-lizards provided the genetic basis that Kitti Ping used to build the Thread-fighting dragons (and Wind Blossom used to build the watch-whers), they speculate that this future affliction of fire-lizards might be fatal to dragons, and that is confirmed when a dead gold dragonet appears – one obviously sickened by the same future disease. The dragon's body is destroyed, but Tieran recovers a decorated piece of metal from its harness. In order to save the dragons of the future, Wind Blossom and Tieran devise a plan to educate someone from the future in genetics and the scientific knowledge to isolate the disease and devise a cure. They create hidden rooms in Benden Weyr and fill them with instructions and equipment to educate that future person. Tieran believes that both the fire-lizard and dragon came from the same woman in the future, since both had similar harness decorations and only women impress gold dragons. He further believes that she has some connection with himself and Wind Blossom – a connection that both dragon and fire lizards followed. He leaves a small souvenir for her in the hidden rooms. About 400 years later, at the beginning of the 3rd Pass of the Red Star, a talented young sketch artist and amateur healer Lorana is hitching a ride across the ocean to the newly built Half-Circle seahold. In a desperate attempt to save her two fire-lizards Grenn and Garth during a storm at sea, she orders them to leave her and believes they are dead. She is found washed up on the beach by dragonriders from Benden Weyr and recovers just in time to impress Arith, a gold dragon. Meanwhile, dragons and fire-lizards are falling sick to a disease with a 100% mortality rate. Fire-lizards are banned from the Weyrs and many die due to the disease. Lorana, who can hear and speak with any dragon, thus sharing in the death of each dragon, frantically scours records in hopes of finding some sort of clue or help towards fighting the disease. She unearths records of hidden rooms in the Weyr and gets them open. The recorded voice of Wind Blossom invites her and her companions to enter and learn what they need to find a cure. Lorana's dragon Arith goes between and dies when a combination of the disease and an injection of watch-wher genetic material wreak havoc with her system. Despite the tragedy of losing Arith and the added burden of over a thousand dragon deaths, Lorana successfully learns how to use such items as a microscope and a genetic sampler to find the disease and create a cure. She can only make a single dose which she injects into the pregnant gold Minith, in hopes that the cure will be passed onto future dragon generations. Minith, her irritable rider Tullea and several others are sent between times to the past to give them time to recover. They return in triumph, with enough cure to save the rest of the dragons. An older and kinder Tullea gives Lorana an ancient locket she had swiped from the first of the hidden rooms. In it are a piece of Arith's harness and pictures of Wind Blossom, Tieran and her fire-lizard Grenn. Plot notes The fire-lizard banishment probably lead to the absence of fire-lizards (once common creatures to the average human on Pern) by Moreta's time (5th or 6th Pass) and their \\"re-discovery\\" by F'nor and Menolly several hundred years later (9th pass). The story also brings back a time shortly after that of Dragonsdawn, introducing the use of drums as a means of communication across distances that figures prominently in the Harper Hall trilogy and other earlier stories. Fire-lizards used to be the main relayers of messages, but with their banishment, people turned to drums to spread news. The loss of technology leads to a shift towards an oral tradition and the creation and use of Teaching Songs. Wind Blossom was trained by her mother Kitti Ping (Dragonsdawn), an Eridani-trained geneticist. The Eridani have a tradition of passing the responsibility of watching over genetic changes to their descendants. Wind Blossom was resistant to this idea, but it still played through as her daughter Emorra marries Tieran – it is strongly implied that Lorana is their descendant. Watch-whers are shown in a more prominent light compared to books written after the 9th pass. It is mentioned that they were purposely built to be nocturnal and fight Thread at night. This is a ret-con from books written by Anne McCaffrey alone. It is unclear if they continue to fight Thread by the 9th pass. Watch-whers that are with humans are misunderstood and have been reduced to chained up watchdogs.

However, Judge I. Leo Glasser barred Shargel and Bruce Cutler from representing Gravano and Gotti, respectively, agreeing with prosecutors' assertion that the lawyers were \\"house counsel\\" to the Gambinos. Prosecutors, including now-Judge John Gleeson, contended that since Shargel and Cutler may have known about criminal activity, they were \\"part of the evidence\\" and liable to be called as witnesses. Shargel's high-profile clients include Daniel Pelosi, who was charged and later convicted of the second-degree murder of East Hampton millionaire Ted Ammon, and Robert \\"Joe\\" Halderman in the matter of Halderman's extortion of TV personality David Letterman. Shargel represented Halderman from October 2009 to March 9, 2010, when Halderman entered a plea-bargained guilty plea. Shargel is well known for his courtroom style and dramatic presentations - in 2005, Murder Inc. record label owners Irv and Chris Gotti (no relation to the Mafia boss mentioned above) were acquitted on all charges. There were a number of lively exchanges between Shargel and NYPD detective Anthony Castiglia during testimony. In 2012, Shargel represented Hip-Hop mogul James \\"Jimmy Henchman\\" Rosemond, CEO of Czar Entertainment, in a federal trial in Brooklyn, New York presided over by Judge Gleeson.

Founded in 1866 by Thomas Bayley Potter for believers in Free Trade doctrine, it was named in honour of Richard Cobden, who had died the year before. Potter was honorary secretary of the Cobden Club from its foundation until his death in 1898. Unusually for contemporary clubs, it had a publishing arm. The publishing arm was instrumental in publishing Cobden's collected speeches in 1870, under the co-editorship of John Bright, one of the club's early patrons. Because of its Free Trade connection, it mainly attracted Liberals as members, but with the fading of both the Liberals as a national force, and of Free Trade as a popular cause, the club fell into decline in the 20th century. The popularity of Temperance reform among members also made it unappealing to potential recruits with the passing years. In 1958 the Cobden Club, by now moribund, was taken over by the classical liberal activist Oliver Smedley.Richard Cockett, Thinking the Unthinkable.

They are common in California, but can also be found in western Nevada and Oregon, as well as in northern Baja California. The upper surfaces of their wings are dark brown to black with wide cream white bands dissecting both wings and two orange patches near the tips of the forewings. The underside is variously colored with browns, blue, orange, and white. A. californica is unpalatable to predators and is part of a large mimicry complex. Taxonomy Adelpha californica is classified under the genus Adelpha (sisters) in the tribe Limenitidini of the subfamily Limenitidinae (admirals and relatives) of the brush-footed butterfly family Nymphalidae. It belongs to the serpa species group of the genus. The species was first described by the British entomologist Arthur Gardiner Butler in 1865 as Heterochroa californica. The type specimen was recovered from California. It was treated generally as a species (though it included Adelpha eulalia as a synonym) until 1944, when the entomologists Geoffrey Douglas Hale Carpenter and Bertram Maurice Hobby reclassified it as a subspecies of Adelpha bredowii. Recent phylogenetic studies, however, conclude that morphological, geographical, and genetic evidence make it clear that it is a separate species. A. californica was also sometimes included in the genus Limenitis (admirals), but most modern lepidopterists classify it under the genus Adelpha. Distribution and habitat A. californica is found in the extreme western North America, from northern Baja California of Mexico, most of California, western Nevada, western Oregon of the United States. It may also sometimes be found in southwestern Washington, though these are believed to be vagrant individuals. They are abundant in oak woodlands. Description Underside of wings The upper surfaces of the wings of A. californica are a dark brown to black. It has two large orange patches near the tip of the forewings and wide postdiscal creamy-white bands on both wings. The ventral surfaces of the wings are generally similar but with blue bands along the edges of both wings, as well as blue and orange patterns on the corners near the body. Like other members of the genus, the butterfly is named \\"sister\\" for its black and white markings on the forewing that resemble a nun's habit. A. californica closely resembles A. bredowii and A. eulalia. However it generally does not share the same distribution range as the other two. A. bredowii is only found in southern and western Mexico. A. eulalia is found in Arizona and the surrounding areas, though it may sometimes be found in southeastern California. They also differ morphologically from A. eulalia in usually being smaller and in the presence of a second orange bar in the upper proximal corner of the hindwings. A. californica also closely resembles the females of some species in the genus Doxocopa. Though their distribution range also do not overlap, as Doxocopa are primarily found in Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and South America. Other species which resemble A. californica (though not as closely) includes other members of the genus Adelpha, and the Lorquin's admiral (Limenitis lorquini). Ecology and life cycle The eggs of A. californica are green. They are laid singly on tips of leaves of oak plants (genus Quercus), on the upper surface. There are four larval instars. The first instar hatches from the egg after eleven days. It is olive green with pale flecks and a mottled light and dark brown head. It builds leaf perches from the leaf midrib, like the larvae of other members of the genus. After nine days, it molts into the second instar which is green with various shades of brown and a light brown head. After eight days it molts again into the third instar which is a pale brownish yellow covered densely in yellowish conical tubercles. It also has developing scoli (horn-like protrusions) each tipped with four to five black spines. The head is a pale green with four vertical brown stripes and also covered with tubercles. The fourth instar develops after four days and is a light reddish brown with greenish sides, yellowish tubercles, and fully developed scoli as well as new developing ones. It molts after nine days into the last instar which is olive green with brown undersides and legs, it is densely covered with yellowish tubercles (particularly at the bottom surfaces). All segments now possess scoli, some bearing white thick conical spines with black tips. The head is brown to pale brown, flattened and smooth, with a double row of long yellowish-white spines at the sides and a pair of black dorsal spines. The second to fifth instars all adopt a front-arched-rear-up posture when resting. After fourteen days, the final instar will pupate. The pupa is pale brown to pale golden yellow with streaks and patches of dark brown and metallic gold. It is attached to tree trunks by large silken webs. The adults emerge after 10 days. The total development time from egg to adult is sixty-five days. The usual host plants for the larvae are the canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis) and the coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), as well as other species of oaks. This diet makes A. californica unpalatable to predators, which might explain why so many other species have formed a mimicry complex around it. The adults are commonly found flying near the upper branches of oak trees or perching near small streams and canyons. Males are commonly seen engaging in mud-puddling in moist ground, typically in mid-morning. Both sexes also feed on nectar from flowers (though this is rare), as well as drink from rotting fruit, sap, and animal droppings. Depending on seasonal conditions and elevation, the species produces one to three generations annually, usually from March through November. The main brood flies from late March into October, and adults may sometimes last through the winter months. Conservation The species is not considered threatened and is classified as G5 by NatureServe. It is abundant throughout its range.

The house, one of the oldest in Portland, was built in 1755 for George Tate, a former Royal Navy captain who was sent by a contractor to the Navy to oversee the felling and shipment of trees for use as masts. Because of the house's comparatively remote location away from central Portland, it (along with a number of other homes that make up the Stroudwater Historic District) survived Portland's numerous fires intact. The house was designated a National Historic Landmark as a rare surviving example of a once-common colonial housing form, the clerestory gambrel roof. Since 1935 it has been a museum operated by the National Society of the Colonial Dames. Description and history The Tate House is set on a rise above the north bank of the Stroudwater River, shortly before it empties into the Fore River on the west side of Portland. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a large central chimney. Its unusual roof line has a basic two-stage gambrel form, except the steeper-pitched lower section is separated from the upper section by a bank of clerestory windows. This form, once common in northern New England, is only known to survive in one other building in Maine, the Burnham Tavern. The house is clad in unfinished clapboards. The interior has a typical center-chimney plan, with a narrow vestibule and winding stair at the front. The first floor is otherwise divided into three rooms: living room/parlor to the right, dining room to the left, and a large kitchen extending across the back. The second floor has three bedrooms, and the third has two more. The public rooms of the house feature high-quality Georgian carved paneling, which is believed to have been brought over from England. In 2014, an archaeological dig at the Tate House found significant wares from the 1750s to 1780s. Pieces of 1750s salt- glazed stoneware, 1760s creamware and 1780s pearlware were discovered. Also found was a white piece of porcelain with tiny brass fears. The dig occurred prior to work beginning on repairing the drainage system. The drainage problem, which funnels water into the basement, creates a significant amount of moisture and poses a threat to the rest of the house. The drainage repair issue will cost $10,000 to $12,000.

Early life Fiszman was born in Willesden, North London and was the son of a Belgian Jewish couple who fled the Nazis during World War II. Career Fiszman made his fortune in diamonds, building Star Diamonds Group which traded in rough diamonds. Star Diamonds Group also owns 16% of Abbeycrest, whose major clients include Argos and Asda. He sold the group in 2007 for £150M, to concentrate on his role in completing Arsenal's new stadium. Other shareholdings took his total worth to around £236m, ranking him 348th on the 2008 Sunday Times Rich List (351st in 2007, 273rd in 2006, 305th in 2005 and 207th in 2004). Arsenal Football Club Fiszman bought into Arsenal Football Club and became a board member through his purchase of an 8% stake from his friend David Dein, starting with 10,000 shares in 1991. Fiszman slowly increased his stake to 24%, the largest shareholder as at 27 September 2007, at which point he led the building of the new Ashburton Grove stadium. In March 2007 Fiszman sold a block of 659 shares for over £3.9m to Stan Kroenke Sports Enterprises (KSE). This was a significant sale as reducing his stake to less than 25% resulted in a loss of veto rights over any future changes to the company statutes. Speculation linked this with a move abroad where he would substantially reduce any Capital Gains Tax liability that would come with a sale of his stake in the club. Fiszman stated his desire not sell any more of his shares for the foreseeable future, after the sale of 5,000 ordinary shares to Kroenke takes the American's stake in Arsenal Holdings plc to 12,756 Shares (representing 20.5%). On 27 March 2009 Fiszman sold 5,000 ordinary shares of £1 each in Arsenal Holdings plc to KSE, UK, Inc, at a price of £8,500 per share. On 11 April 2011, two days before his death, he sold his Arsenal shares amounting to 16.11% of club's stake to KSE, due to his declining health. Personal life Fiszman and his wife Sally lived in St Prex near Geneva, Switzerland. His hobbies included running and flying – he was a fully qualified commercial jet pilot. Fiszman had been undergoing treatment for throat cancer at the time of his death. He died on 13 April 2011 aged 66.

Set in the small town of Byron in the Blue Mountains of Australia in the years just before World War I, the novel is the story of Missy Wright and the Hurlingford family. Plot summary In the years before World War I in Byron, Australia, the males of the Hurlingford family hold all the power and money. Those Hurlingford women without a man due to spinsterhood or widowhood lead cramped lives of hard work and little money on scraps of land or in businesses that just barely support them. Thirty-something spinster Missy Wright leads a narrow existence on the wrong side of the tracks with her widowed mother Drusilla Hurlingford Wright and crippled aunt Octavia when Byron is consumed by two events, the upcoming wedding of Missy's beautiful cousin Alicia Marshall to William Hurlingford and the arrival of rough looking stranger named John Smith. With limited funds and suffering bouts of ill health, Missy's only consolation are her trips to the lending library where her distant cousin Una Hurlingford works. Una, a society beauty, has returned to Byron after a glamorous life in Sydney. Under Una's tutelage and bolstered by the romantic novels she sneaks home, Missy begins to dream of the world outside Byron and a better life for herself. Bolstered by a confrontation with her cousin Alicia and a trip to a Sydney doctor, Missy breaks free of her Byron shackles, finds financial independence for her older female Hurlingford relations and ends up the happy bride of the mystery man John Smith.

One song that originated in the show was \\"Mister Dooley\\" which became famously associated with The Wizard of Oz for decades, when John Slavin, in the title role, interpolated the song for much of the first year of its run. The piece opened at the Theatre Royal in Hanley, England on 16 October 1899 and then toured extensively. After that, it played at the Royal Strand Theatre in London, managed by Frank Curzon, opening on 5 October 1901 for an astonishing run of 1,075 performances. It also played at the Casino Theatre, in New York, opening on 2 June 1902 for a run of 376 performances.

Biography Takaezu was born to Japanese immigrant parents in Pepeekeo, Hawaii, on 17 June 1922. She moved to Honolulu in 1940, where she worked at the Hawaii Potter's Guild creating identical pieces from press molds. While she hated creating hundreds of identical pieces, she appreciated that she could practice glazing. Takaezu attended Saturday classes at the Honolulu Museum of Art School (1947–1949) and attended the University of Hawaii (1948, 1951) where she studied under Claude Horan. From 1951 to 1954, she continued her studies at Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan (1951), where she befriended Finnish ceramist Maija Grotell, who became her mentor.Honolulu Museum of Art, Spalding House: Self-guided Tour, Sculpture Garden, pp. 5 & 18 Takaezu earned an award after her first year of study, which acknowledged her as an outstanding student in the clay department. In 1955, Takaezu traveled to Japan, where she studied Zen Buddhism, tea ceremony, and the techniques of traditional Japanese pottery, which influenced her work. While studying in Japan, she worked with Kaneshige Toyo and visited Shoji Hamada, both influential Japanese potters. She taught at several universities and art schools: Cranbrook Academy of Art, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan; University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin; Cleveland Institute of Art, Cleveland, Ohio (10 years); Honolulu Academy of Art, Honolulu, Hawaii; and Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey (1967–1992), where she was awarded an honorary doctorate. She retired in 1992 to become a studio artist, living and working in the Quakertown section of Franklin Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey, about 30 miles northwest of Princeton. In addition to her studio in New Jersey, she made many of her larger sculptures at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York. Toshiko Takaezu made functional wheel-thrown vessels early in her career. Later she switched to abstract sculptures with freely applied poured and painted glazes. In the early 1970s, when she didn't have access to a kiln, she painted on canvas. Takaezu died on March 9, 2011 in Honolulu, following a stroke she suffered in May 2010. The Toshiko Takaezu Foundation was established in 2015 to support the legacy of the artist Toshiko Takaezu.  Work  Takaezu treated life with a sense of wholesomeness and oneness with nature; everything she did was to improve and discover herself. She believed that ceramics involved self- revelation, once commenting, \\"In my life I see no difference between making pots, cooking and growing vegetables... there is need for me to work in clay... it gives me answers for my life.\\" When she developed her signature “closed form” after sealing her pots, she found her identity as an artist. The ceramic forms resembled human hearts and torsos, closed cylindrical forms, and huge spheres she called “moons.” Before closing the forms, she dropped a bead of clay wrapped in paper inside, so that the pieces would rattle when moved. She was once asked by Chobyo Yara what the most important part of her ceramic pieces is. She replied that it is the hollow space of air within, because it cannot be seen but is still part of the pot.

Biography  Steven Heller was born July 7, 1950, in New York City to Bernice and Milton Heller. He attended the Walden School, a progressive prep school on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, as well as military school. In 1968, he became the art director of the New York Free Press without formal education or credentials because of his leftist leanings, later attending some New York University lectures utilizing his press pass. He met illustrator Brad Holland who convinced him page layouts and type choices mattered, of which Heller was previously unconcerned with. After the Free Press, he moved on to various publications, including porn tabloid Screw. In 1974, Heller became the art director for The New York Times Op-Ed page, replacing Jean-Claude Suares. His interest in illustration employed on the Op-Ed page led him to publish collections on the subject. He became the art director of The New York Times Book Review in 1977. In the 1980s, he became interested in design through friendships with Seymour Chwast and Louise Fili, who he later married, as well as becoming the editor of the AIGA Journal of Graphic Design. Under his care, the Journal became a place of critical design writing, inviting authors from a variety of professions and nurturing the careers of fledgling critics, who documented design writing. In 1984, Heller helped create the master’s program for illustration at the School of Visual Arts. In 2007, he began transition from his 30 year career at the New York Times. The changes created a lot of stress, and his Parkinson’s was either triggered or exacerbated. In 2008, Heller co-founded the MFA in design criticism program (D-Crit) with Alice Twemlow. The program was intended to help non-designers find a place in the design field. As of 2019, His on the faculty of the School of Visual Arts as co-chair of the MFA Design Department, special assistant to the president, and co-founder of the MFA Design Criticism, MPS Branding, MFA Interaction Design, MFA Products of Design programs. Heller's pupils have included Deborah Adler.  Awards and recognition  In 1996, he was inducted into the Art Directors Club Hall of Fame. In 1999, Heller received an AIGA Medal for what designer Paula Scher described as \\"lifetime achievement that comes from a workday existing roughly between 4:30 and 8:45 A.M. before a full workday at the New York Times Book Review.\\" The Society of Illustrators honored Heller with the Richard Gangel Art Director Award in 2005. In 2017, the AIGA named an award, the Steven Heller Prize for Cultural Commentary, in his honor, citing his three decades of contributions to cultural discourse on design. In 2011, was awarded the Design Mind Award by the National Design Museum.  Writing   Articles  Heller is author and co-author of many works on the history of illustration, typography, and many subjects related to graphic design. He has published more than eighty titles and written articles for magazines including Affiche, Baseline, Creation, Design, Design Issues, Design Observer, Eye, Graphis, How, I.D., Oxymoron, Mother Jones, The New York Times Book Review, Print, Speak, and U&lc; magazine. For thirty-three years Heller was a senior art director of U&lc; magazine, a publication devoted to typography.  Books (partial list)  Heller has written, co-authored, and/or edited more than 130 books about design and popular culture. He worked with Seymour Chwast to create Push Pin Editions and more than 20 books for Chronicle Books with his wife, Louise Fili. *Innovators of American illustration, Steven Heller. 1986. *Design Culture: An Anthology of Writing from the AIGA Journal of Graphic Design, Marie Finamore, Steven Heller. 1997. *Sourcebook of visual ideas, Steven Heller, Seymour Chwast. 1989. *Designing with illustration, Steven Heller, Karen Pomeroy. 1990. *Borrowed design: use and abuse of historical form, Steven Heller, Julie Lasky. 1993. *Italian Art Deco: Graphic Design Between the Wars, Steven Heller, Louise Fili. 1993. *Streamline: American Art Deco Graphic Design, Steven Heller, Louise Fili. 1995. *Japanese modern: graphic design between the wars, James Fraser, Steven Heller, Seymour Chwast. 1996. * Design Literacy (continued): Understanding Graphic Design, Steven Heller. 1999. * Paul Rand, Steven Heller, Paul Rand, Jessica Helfand. 1999 * Anatomy of Design: Uncovering the Influences and Inspiration in Modern Graphic Design, Steven Heller, Mirko Ilic. 1999. * Typology: Type Design from the Victorian Era to the Digital Age, Steven Heller, Louise Fili. 1999. * British Modern: Graphic Design Between the Wars, Steven Heller, Louise Fili. 2001. *Red Scared!: The Commie Menace in Propaganda and Popular Culture, Michael Barson, Steven Heller. 2001. *This Way - That Way: Prints + Posters Exhibitions + Environments, Keith Godard, Edwin Schlossberg, Steven Heller. 2001. * Design Humor: The Art of Graphic Wit, Steven Heller. 2002. *Citizen Designer: Perspectives on Design Responsibility, Steven Heller, Veronique Vienne. 2003. * Teaching Graphic Design: Course Offerings and Class Projects from the Leading Graduate and Undergraduate Programs, Steven Heller. 2003. * Design Literacy: Understanding Graphic Design, Steven Heller. 2004. *Inside the Business of Illustration, Steven Heller, Marshall Arisman. 2004. *Times Square Style: Graphics from the Great White Way, Vicki Gold Levi, Steven Heller. 2004. *Euro Deco: Graphic Design Between the Wars, Steven Heller, Louise Fili. 2005. *Nigel Holmes: On Information Design, Steven Heller, Nigel Holmes. 2006. * Stylepedia: A Guide to Graphic Design Mannerisms, Quirks, and Conceits, Steven Heller, Louise Fili. 2006. * Design Disasters: Great Designers, Fabulous Failure, and Lessons Learned, Steven Heller. 2008. * Design Entrepreneur: Turning Graphic Design Into Goods That Sell, Steven Heller, Lita Talarico. 2008. * Design School Confidential: Extraordinary Class Projects From the International Design Schools, Colleges, and Institutes, Steven Heller, Lita Talarico. 2009. * Becoming a Graphic Designer: A Guide to Careers in Design, Steven Heller, Teresa Fernandes. 2010. *The Swastika: Symbol Beyond Redemption?, Steven Heller. 2010. * Becoming a Digital Designer: A Guide to Careers in Web, Video, Broadcast, Game and Animation Design, Steven Heller, David Womack. 2011. * Design School: Extraordinary Class Projects From International Design Schools, Steven Heller, Lita Talarico. 2011. * Graphic Design Reader, Steven Heller. 2012. * Stop, Think, Go, Do: How Typography and Graphic Design Influence Behavior, Steven Heller, Mirko Ilic. 2012. *Design Firms Open for Business, Steven Heller, Lita Talarico. 2013. *Lettering Large: Art and Design of Monumental Typography, Steven Heller, Mirko Ilić. 2013. *Writing and Research for Graphic Designers: A Designer's Manual to Strategic Communication and Presentation, Steven Heller. 2013. * Becoming a Graphic and Digital Designer: A Guide to Careers in Design, Steven Heller, Veronique Vienne. 2015. *Graphic Style Lab: Develop Your Own Style with 50 Hands-On Exercises, Steven Heller. 2015. *Becoming a Design Entrepreneur: How to Launch Your Design-Driven Ventures from Apps to Zines, Lita Talarico, Steven Heller. 2016. *Graphic Design Rants and Raves: Bon Mots on Persuasion, Entertainment, Education, Culture, and Practice, Steven Heller. 2017. *The Design of Dissent, Expanded Edition: Greed, Nationalism, Alternative Facts, and the Resistance, Milton Glaser, Mirko Ilic, Tony Kushner, Steven Heller. 2017. * The Moderns: Midcentury American Graphic Design, Steven Heller, Greg D'Onofrio. 2017. *100 Ideas that Changed Graphic Design, Steven Heller, Veronique Vienne. 2019. * Teaching Graphic Design History, Steven Heller. 2019.

Object The “sector” to which WiC’s statements frequently refer consists of what some have called the “Thin Red/Black Line”; a shorthand way of referring to the small but highly diverse sector of various non-market, anti-statist, libertarian socialists – whether organised or not – consisting of; e.g., syndicalists, anarcho-communists, libertarian municipalists, world socialists, socialist industrial unionists, council communists, autonomists, platformists, situationists, ultra-leftists, etc. History Previous efforts to bring these various elements together, and, to a greater or lesser extent, inspiring those who founded the World in Common project, were the Discussion Bulletin of Frank Girard, published from 1983 to July 2003, the year before Girard’s death; The “Imagine International” circular among these same groups in the late 1990s; The Red Menace, a Canadian publication of the 1970s; as well as the writings of such thinkers as Maximilien Rubel, John Crump, and not infrequent references to the commonalities in many of the classic anarchist and socialist thinkers. The purpose of WiC (according to the WiC “Core Statement”)is “to help inspire a vision of an alternative way of living where all the world’s resources are owned in common and democratically controlled by communities on an ecologically sustainable and socially harmonious basis”. Of course, the many other groups and political parties in this sector have much the same objective but the role that WiC envisions for itself is unique. In their view, one of the reasons that the anti-market anti-statist sector remains relatively small and ineffectual has to do with the extent to which the various groups remain isolated from each other and regard each other with mutual suspicion, and even sectarian hostility.http://www.worldincommon.org/join.html Theory While explicitly not suggesting that all these “strands” of this sector submerge their differences and unite in some large organization, which is seen by WiC as both unrealistic and even undesirable, they do support an intermediate position between that extreme and the other, of exclusionist hostility. On that basis, they do not see themselves as rivals to any group in the sector and some members belong to one or other such groups. Nor do they see themselves, in any sense, as a political party. Among the members currently are self-identified council communists, anarcho-socialists, DeLeonists, libertarian socialists, and world socialists, both with and without organised affiliations to their political positions. World in Common was established to provide a meeting ground for the different groups and individuals within the sector as well as a means of facilitating practical collaboration between them at some level, while recognizing that there are sharp differences of opinion on many different subjects within our sector but what they do not feel has been sufficiently recognised – and celebrated – is just how much these groups have in common with each other. It is these commonalities that are, in fact, rather more significant than the issues that divide us which the World in Common network attempts to highlight by means of various websites, internet discussion groups, an occasional journal, Common Voice (2005),http://www.cvoice.org/ a collective blog, and various real world interactions with the various elements making up the “impossibilist” non- market political sector, whether they prefer the term anarchist, communist, socialist. Membership Membership in the World in Common project is open to anti-capitalists, anti-statists, anti-reformists, anti-authoritarians, anti- vanguardists, anarchists, communists, socialists, syndicalists, anarcho- communists, libertarian municipalists, world socialists, socialist industrial unionists, council communists, and any who reject capitalism’s wage, market, and money system as well as capitalist politics and capitalist unionism and who recognise that the above are on the same relative side in the struggle against all of capitalism’s forces, including its statist left-wing of vanguardists and social democrats, and who seek ways to practically – in their local areas – assist this political sector to grow as a whole while engaging in comradely discussion at all levels, if in broad agreement with the Core Statement.

Geographic range Central and eastern Africa from Nigeria east to Sudan, Uganda, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, and south to Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi and DR Congo. An isolated population occurs in western Angola. The type locality is listed as \\"Sennâr, vom Gebel-Ghule\\" (Jebel Ghule, Sennar, Sudan). Habitat Prefers low-lying moist savanna, wooded hills, high grasslands, and the riparian zones of rivers that run through swamps, rocky gorges, coastal scrubland and semi-deserts. Also known to occur in man-made habitats, such as abandoned quarries, sugar cane plantations and in borrow pit pools along roads. Behavior If disturbed, they inflate themselves and put on a ferocious hissing and puffing threat display. The front part of the body is raised and coiled from which position they tend to make sweeping and lashing strikes as opposed to a stabbing motion. They are mostly terrestrial, but are also good swimmers and have been known to climb into sedges in pursuit of prey. Despite their common name, they are diurnal and are often seen basking. They hide under ground cover when not active.

Bogdan Janski, Peter Semenenko, and Jerome Kajsiewicz, the first three members, are regarded as the founders. As a university student in Warsaw, Janski became involved in various student movements. He then studied economics in France, England, and Germany. Disenchanted with various social movements, he began to assist Polish exiles living in France, where he worked as a tutor. He supplemented his meager income as a contributor to encyclopedic dictionaries and dispersed his funds among poor Polish exiles throughout France. Janski sent two of his associates, Peter Semenenko and Jerome Kajsiewicz to Rome to work on re-establishing the Polish college to educate priests for Poland. Joining them, the three established a small community. Semenenko and Kajsiewicz were ordained in 1842. Pope Pius IX advised them to \\"Organize yourselves in a way that will do the most good for the Church\\".Resurrection Seminary The name of the Congregation refers to the bells sounded in Rome at noon on Easter Sunday, 1842, when the first seven brothers left the Catacombs of San Sebastiano, near San Sebastiano fuori le mura, after their religious vows. In 1866 the Collegio Polacco (Polish College) college was finally opened due to the efforts of the Congregation of the Resurrection, which raised the first funds to which Princess Odelscalchi, Pius IX, and others contributed later.Pontificio Collegio Polacco As consecrated religious, resurrectionists profess the vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. Their life as consecrated religious within the Congregation of the Resurrection is fulfilled as a Priest, Brother or Permanent Deacon. Internationally, they are divided into three Provinces and one Region, ministering in more than twelve countries worldwide. The Community works and has its missions in Italy, Poland, Bulgaria, Austria, Germany, Canada, the United States, Brazil, Bolivia, Australia, Bermuda, Mexico, Ukraine, Belarus, Slovakia, and Israel.

Place Names Commission. Retrieved 12 October 2014.) is a townland in County Meath, Ireland, for the area between Oristown and Donaghpatrick Kells. It was named for the Irish mythological figure or goddess, Tailtiu. The Tailtin Fair was held there in medieval times as a revival of the ancient Aonach Tailteann, and was revived as the Tailteann Games for a period in the twentieth century. While mound structures near Teltown have been asserted in legends in the Book of Invasions to be ancient man-made earthworks 2500 years old, modern archaeological reports of the area suggest they date to at least the Iron Age.Lebor Gabála Érenn, original text edited and translated by R A Stewart Macalister, D.

Part of one of the mounds in the area called the Knockauns () was partially destroyed by bulldozers for urbanization in 1997. John O'Donovan claimed that loughs near a fort in the area called the Rath Dhubh \\"have the appearance of being artificial lakes and may have been used when the Olympic Games of Tailteann were celebrated by the Irish\\".

The neighbourhood is bordered by Bloor Street West to the north, Ossington Ave to the east, College Street to the south, and Dufferin Street to the west. Character Victorian to Edwardian. The neighbourhood is very green, with many trees and some of the largest gardens and yards in Toronto, and it has a very active nightlife, with many \\"hip\\" and urban restaurants scattered along Bloor and College. There are also many small independent specialty shops like bakeries, smoothie shops, and bike stores. The main streets of the neighbourhood are Bloor, College and Dufferin Streets. Dufferin, a four-lane arterial, is mostly residential with the exception of the Dufferin Mall on the west side south of Bloor. College Street is a four- lane arterial road, with a mix of commercial storefronts and residences. The neighbourhood is predominantly two or three-storey detached or semi-detached homes at a medium density. The majority of Dufferin Grove houses were built between 1890 and 1930. Dufferin Grove's semi-detached and detached houses are larger than those found in most downtown Toronto neighbourhoods. The architectural style of the homes in Dufferin Grove ranges from early and late Victorian to Edwardian and English Cottage style designs. Dufferin Grove is a popular family-oriented neighbourhood due to the size of the houses and the amenities, including a popular community park, a shopping centre, schools and access to public transit. Dufferin Grove is home to two elementary public schools, Ossington Old Orchard Public School and Dewson Street Junior Public School. History Dufferin Grove looking south from Havelock Avenue, 1913. The Dufferin Grove district was first settled by the Denison Family, who emigrated to Canada from England in 1792. The Denisons were active participants in Toronto's early military and political affairs. Their country villas were Toronto landmarks, that had titles such as \\"Dover Court\\", \\"Rush Holme\\", and \\"Heydon Villa\\". In 1834, with the city encroaching at their doorstep, the Denisons decided to clear the dense forest covering their property, and began cultivating this land. The fertile soil in the area yielded abundant crops and brought the Denisons great wealth. However, by the 1880s, the value of the Denison estates lay in housing development not agriculture. Thus rows of crops were gradually replaced by rows of houses and the current neighbourhood was developed. Demographics In the west (and to an extent east) end of the neighbourhood there is a large population of Portuguese, spreading out from Little Portugal located to the south-west. The area has a larger than average population (compared to the rest of Toronto) in the age groups between 25–39, according to 2006 census data. Education Four public school boards operate in Brockton Village, Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir (CSCM), Conseil scolaire Viamonde (CSV), the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), and the Toronto District School Board (TDSB). TDSB is a secular public school board that operates two elementary schools, Dawson Street Junior Public School and Ossington/Old Orchard Junior Public School, with both formerly operated by the Toronto Board of Education. TCDSB is a separate public school board that operates one secondary school in the neighbourhood, St. Mary Catholic Academy although the building was formerly known as an elementary school, J. J. McGrand Catholic School and later became the southern campus of Brother Edmund Rice Catholic Secondary School.

History Delbert Meadows opened a small custard stand in Duncansville, Pennsylvania. After decades of business, the Meadows brothers decided to add batting cages, mini golf, and go-karts to their location. Now considered a landmark in western Pennsylvania, the Duncansville location is still in operation and owned by Dick, Jay and Joel Meadows, sons of Delbert Meadows. The Original Meadows Frozen Custard stand located in Duncansville, PA. Original Frozen Custard The frozen custard is an original recipe that has been in the Meadows family for decades. On July 4th 1950 the Meadows brothers, J.V., Richard and Delbert, worked with Seal- Test dairy to come up with a unique frozen custard recipe that is still used today. When Seal-Test dairy went out of business the recipe was then transferred to Galliker's Dairy who is now in charge of the production. The Meadows menu includes shakes, sundaes, arctic swirls, banana splits, root beer floats, strawberry shortcakes, smoothies, and cones. Current In 2003, the Meadows brothers (Dick, Jay, and Joe) sold the Meadows franchise to Gardner Meadows Inc. Since the purchase of the Meadows franchise, Gardner Meadows Inc. has opened 12 franchises and have 9 in current development. These franchises are located across Pennsylvania and Maryland. Demand has caused more franchises to form, each individually owned and operated. Over fifty years later each Meadows location still serves the same recipe that got its start in 1950. Locations include: Bedford, Pennsylvania, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, Carlisle, Pennsylvania, Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, Clarion, Pennsylvania, Clearfield, Pennsylvania, Columbia, Maryland, Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania, DuBois, Pennsylvania, Ebensburg, Pennsylvania, Enola, Pennsylvania, Frederick, Maryland, Greensburg, Pennsylvania, Greenwood (Altoona), Pennsylvania, Hagerstown, Maryland, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Hollidaysburg (Duncansville), Pennsylvania, Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Monroeville, Pennsylvania, Oak Ridge, North Carolina, Waynesboro, Pennsylvania, York, Pennsylvania, Ashburn, Virginia.

In 2008 Travel Channel program \\"Taste of America\\" visited the Meadows to film a special segment on the frozen custard stand. The episode was broadcast Wednesday, May 7, 2008 at 11:00 p.m. EST on The Travel Channel. Show host Mark DeCarlo and crew visited The Meadows to get a taste of The Meadows' famous frozen custard. DeCarlo visited with the Meadows family and many of the firm's loyal customers.

The small unit consisted mainly of the Student Battalion (Kurin) of Sich Riflemen, a unit of the Khmelnytsky Cadet School, and a Free Cossacks company. Just before the assault Tymchenko was replaced by D.Nosenko, while Tymchenko left for Nizhyn in attempt to recruit the locally quartered Shevchenko Regiment (800 soldiers) on the Ukrainian side. Nonetheless on January 30, 1918 the regiment sided with the Soviet regime, the news of which forced the Ukrainian garrison of Kruty hastily to withdraw. Over half of the 400 men were killed during the battle, which lasted up to five hours. In the Soviet historiography the battle is mistakenly dated on January 29, 1918 and confused with the Plysky rail station skirmish (:uk:Плиски (станція)). The Haidamaka Kish of Symon Petlyura (300 soldiers) that rushed to reinforce the Kruty garrison and was delayed due to the Darnytsia railworkers sabotage stopped in close vicinity (rail station Bobryk) and eventually turned back to Kyiv due to the Bolshevik's Arsenal Uprising that occurred on the same day. Aftermath Eleven of the students were re-buried at Askold's Grave in the centre of Kyiv after the return of the Tsentralna Rada to the capital in March 1918. At the funeral the then President of the Ukrainian People's Republic, Mykhailo Hrushevsky, called every one of the 400 students who fought in the battle, heroes. In addition, poet Pavlo Tychyna wrote about the heroic death of the students. After the fall of the Ukrainian People's Republic the bodies of the students were moved to the Lukyanivske Cemetery in Kyiv. Ukrainian legacy The true story of the battle was hidden by the Soviet Government. Only recently, a monument was set up to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Kruty at Askold's Grave, and a commemorative hryvnia coin was minted. In 2006, the Kruty Heroes Monument was erected on the site of the historic battle.

The current church replaced an earlier adobe church which was built in 1881. Building work on the present church began in 1902 and was completed in 1914. The church was dedicated in 1915, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places as St. Mary's Church in 1978. The oldest Roman Catholic parish church in the greater Phoenix, Arizona, area, it was the only parish in Phoenix until 1924 and is home to Arizona's largest stained glass windows collection and a 26 rank pipe organ built by the Schantz Organ Company. Architecture The church's Mission Revival–Spanish Colonial Revival structure supports four domes spanning the length of the Basilica. All the domes are compound design with the pendentives, following Roman architecture, transferring the weight of the roof to the pillars. The dome over the intercept point of the crossover, the nave center aisle and the apse, is topped with stained glass and features a lantern above the dome to emit light into the nave and sanctuary. The dome located over the altar is topped with a cupola designed to provide light to the altar. The two bell towers are topped with onion shaped domes, typical of the churches of Bavaria and Austria, where Fr. Novatus Benzing, the Pastor at the time, and Br. Leonard Darscheid, the Architectural Consultant, both originated. The towers house four bells which ring daily. The renowned Gothic-style stained glass collection was manufactured by the Emil Frei Studio of Missouri. The large upper windows depict scenes from the life of the Blessed Virgin Mary, while the lower nave and transept windows depict images of popular Saints of the Franciscan Order and of the heritage of the cultures represented in the community at the time (German, Spanish, Irish). Also noteworthy are the Stations of the Cross by the Andrew Kaletta Studio of St Louis. Rather than simply being painted, they are cast in high relief on a gold background which causes the figures and their detailed features to stand out prominently. Basilica Pope John Paul II elevated St. Mary's to the rank of a minor basilica in 1985, two years before his visit to Phoenix in 1987, when he visited St. Mary's and addressed crowds of thousands from the balcony on the facade. The principal symbols of its status as a Basilica, the Tintinnabulum (large bell on a column) and the Ombrellone (Large gold and red umbrella) are displayed prominently in the sanctuary. St. Mary's became the 32nd basilica in the United States and remains the only basilica in Arizona. The church, a Phoenix Points of Pride, is located at the northeast corner of North 3rd Street and Monroe in downtown Phoenix, a carillon of the burgeoning Copper Square. Liturgy and worship Saint Mary's Basilica is a very active parish church and center of worship for the Diocese of Phoenix. It is known for maintaining a traditional form of liturgy featuring the pipe organ, choir, men's schola and a wide range of music from traditional Gregorian chant to Renaissance polyphony and contemporary composers in its services. Beautiful liturgies rich in ceremonial and incense combined with a warm sense of inclusivity and Francisan hospitality ensure that attending the Holy Mass at the Basilica is a very moving and transcendent experience. Masses are celebrated from Monday to Friday at Noon, beginning with the singing of the Angelus, and on Sundays at 5.00 p.m. (Saturday Vigil), 9.00 a.m. and 11.00 a.m. Solemn Choral Vespers are also celebrated on Sunday evenings at 5.00 p.m. during the seasons of Advent and Lent. St. Mary's also holds Devotions to Saint Anthony of Padua on Tuesdays after the noon Mass, and Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament on Thursdays after the noon Mass, concluding with Benediction at 2.00 p.m. Clergy and staff The Basilica is staffed by the Franciscan Friars of the Province of Saint Barbara, whose Coat of Arms and various symbolism can be found displayed prominently throughout the building. The Rector is The Very Rev. Michael Weldon, O.F.M., and he is assisted by the Parochial Vicars, Rev. Micah Muhlen, O.F.M. and Rev. Edward Sarrazin, O.F.M. Also in residence are Rev. Luis Baldonado, O.F.M. and Br. Scott Slattum, O.F.M. Due to the centrality of its location and its historical importance, many of the important liturgical events of the Diocese of Phoenix are split between the Basilica and the Cathedral of Saints Simon and Jude, with the Bishop of Phoenix, The Most Rev.

A native of Woburn, Massachusetts, LeRoux graduated from Woburn Memorial High School and Northeastern University and was a veteran of the United States Marine Corps. Led 1977 group that purchased Red Sox Buddy LeRoux invested in real estate and a series of physical therapy and rehabilitation hospitals during the 1970s and by he was a wealthy man — wealthy enough to assemble a group of investors seeking to purchase the Red Sox from Jean Yawkey, the widow of Tom Yawkey, the team's longtime owner who had died in . With the backing of Rogers Badgett, a Kentucky-based coal magnate,\\"Buddy LeRoux Heads BoSox Coup,\\" The Associated Press, 1983-06-07 LeRoux put together a 30-share limited partnership and then recruited Red Sox vice president Haywood Sullivan, one of Mrs. Yawkey's favorites among her husband's employees, as a member of his syndicate. When the American League initially rejected the purchase in 1978, Mrs. Yawkey herself joined the LeRoux-Sullivan bid, and when the league finally approved the sale on May 23, the club had three general partners: LeRoux (in charge of business operations), Sullivan (general manager in charge of baseball operations) and Mrs. Yawkey (club president). At one point, LeRoux and Badgett controlled an estimated 42 percent of Red Sox stock. Rebelled against fellow general partners in 1983 But LeRoux and his limited partners grew restive when the Red Sox fell from contention, and attendance at Fenway Park and revenues fell from prior levels. Part of the club's on-field decline was due to fiscal belt- tightening and refusal to compete aggressively for veteran talent by retaining or signing free agents, although it was not clear which general partner ordered the policy. Reportedly, the LeRoux faction wanted the team run in a more \\"business-like\\" manner, while Mrs. Yawkey sought to preserve some of the philosophies of her late husband, known as a \\"player-friendly\\" owner. LeRoux was thwarted in an attempt to sell his share in the team for $20 million to Boston businessman David Mugar, and then rejected a counter-offer from Mrs. Yawkey and Sullivan. In the event, in , a season in which the team suffered its first losing campaign since , the rift among the ownership factions became public. On June 6, prior to a Monday night home game against the Detroit Tigers, the Red Sox planned a special benefit for stricken former star outfielder Tony Conigliaro, who had been incapacitated at age 37 by a heart attack in January 1982. Conigliaro's old teammates from the 1967 \\"Impossible Dream\\" Red Sox assembled for a pre-game ceremony, and a crowd of nearly 24,000 gathered, one of the largest gates at Fenway Park since Opening Day.1983 Retrosheet: Boston Red Sox game log Boston's television stations had crews in place to cover \\"Tony C Night.\\" But prior to the festivities, LeRoux called a press conference and announced that he and the majority of the team's limited partners, chiefly Badgett and Al Curran, were exercising language in their partnership agreement to overthrow Sullivan and Yawkey and take command of the club. He announced a \\"reorganization of internal management\\" and appointed himself managing general partner, while bringing in former Red Sox general manager Dick O'Connell to replace Sullivan as head of baseball operations. Boston media immediately dubbed the gambit the Coup LeRoux. Lost legal battle to take over team The two ousted general partners immediately filed suit against LeRoux, were granted an injunction, and then battled him in court over the next 12 months. The trial revealed unflattering details about all the principals: it was learned that LeRoux and his faction were in secret negotiations to buy the Cleveland Indians while still involved with the Red SoxThe New York Times, 1983-07-12 and LeRoux's legal team heaped criticism upon the management decisions of Mrs. Yawkey and Sullivan. In early June 1984, the legal fight ended with an appeals court ruling against LeRoux. He was removed as the team's executive vice president, administration, and his allies were purged from management. In late 1985, Jean Yawkey bought out Badgett, Curran and LeRoux's own limited partnership (which reportedly fetched $2 million). On March 30, 1987, Mrs. Yawkey acquired LeRoux's general partnership for a reported $7 millionThe New York Times, March 31, 1987 to become majority general partner in the team. LeRoux then largely faded from the public eye, although from 1986–89 he did own Boston's Suffolk Downs thoroughbred racetrack. By the late 1980s, he had filed assets of $100 million, \\"including oil wells, greyhound racing dogs and antique cars.\\" LeRoux died at age 77 from non-prescribed medicine given to him by a doctor in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, on January 7, 2008. He was the brother of Roger LeRoux who had a son named Mark LeRoux who married Susan Delaney. Mark and Susan had two children, named Nicholas and Chris LeRoux.

He was professor of radiology at the Washington University School of Medicine for over 30 years. A pioneer in nuclear medicine, he is best known for his research on the positron emission tomography (PET). He is considered one of its creators and often referred to as the \\"father of PET.\\" Early life Ter-Pogossian was born on April 21, 1925 in Berlin to Armenian parents from the Ottoman Empire that escaped the Armenian Genocide. He was the only child. His family later moved to France, where Ter-Pogossian grew up. He developed an early interest in science and experimented with toy physics and chemistry kits as a child. Ter-Pogossian attended the University of Paris, from which he received his bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1942 or 1943. He subsequently studied at the Institute of Radium under Irène Joliot-Curie, graduating in 1946. He was active in the French Resistance during World War II. Career Ter-Pogossian moved to the United States in 1946 to complete his studies. He preferred to the US over Britain because the former seemed \\"more exciting.\\" He enrolled at Washington University in St. Louis as a graduate student in 1946. He was drawn to the university by and studied under Arthur Compton, who was also the university's chancellor at the time. He simultaneously worked in the physics department as a research assistant. Ter- Pogossian received his master's degree in 1948, and his Ph.D. in nuclear physics from Washington University in 1950. He joined the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology at Washington University in 1950. In the same year he also joined the faculty of Washington University School of Medicine as an Instructor in Radiation Physics. He was named professor of radiation physics in 1961, Professor of Biophysics in Physiology in 1964, and Professor of Radiation Sciences in 1973. Between 1963 and 1991 Ter-Pogossian served as Director of the Division of Radiation Sciences at the Mallinckrodt Institute. After resigning from administrative duties in 1990, Ter-Pogossian devoted all his time to research. He was a self-proclaimed \\"research junkie\\". He became emeritus professor in 1995. Work Ter-Pogossian spent his entire professional career at Washington University's Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology. His research focused on \\"increasing the number of practical clinical applications of cerebral scanning.\\" His worked resulted in improvement of medical imaging, radiation therapy, brachytherapy. He developed a new type of nuclear medicine gamma camera, known as the \\"Ter-Pogossian camera.\\" In 1951 Ter-Pogossian developed a pioneering scanner that detected radioactivity concentrations in living material. In the mid-1950s he \\"reported the first biomedical application of a sodium iodide detector for the diagnosis and localization of intracranial tumors.\\" Positron emission tomography (PET) Ter-Pogossian was a pioneer in the use of cyclotron-produced radioactive tracers. He is best known for his work on the positron emission tomography (PET). His research began in the 1950s with a series of experiments that made PET a \\"practical diagnostic tool\\" by the 1970s. His early work led to the installation of a small biomedical cyclotron in the basement at the Washington University Medical Center in 1963. He persuaded several government agencies to support the research. It was the first cyclotron in the US located in a medical center. The cyclotron produced short-lived, positron-emitting radionuclides intended to be used to develop techniques for measuring regional cerebral blood flow, oxygen metabolism, blood volume, and glucose metabolism. The first PET unit was created in 1974 by the group led by Ter-Pogossian. A decade later, PET units of that design were \\"used in many medical centers throughout the world.\\" Ter-Pogossian is recognized to have \\"led the research that turned the positron emission tomography (PET) scanner from an intriguing concept to a medical tool used in hospitals and laboratories everywhere.\\" With Edward J. Hoffman and Michael E. Phelps \\"he played a major role turning positron imaging from a laboratory concept into practical imaging protocols and devices that are currently used worldwide.\\" Personal life and death Ter-Pogossian was married to Ann (née Scott). They had two sons and a daughter. He was a resident of Clayton, Missouri. He traveled extensively and was a gourmet and a scuba diver. He was described by Ronald G.

The ship was launched in 1980 and entered service in 1981. The ferry normally operates on BC Ferries' Horseshoe Bay to Langdale route. She is named for the city of Surrey. On May 12, 2003, Queen of Surrey suffered an engine fire that disabled the ferry in Howe Sound. No one was injured and the ship was returned to service. In 2004, the ferry was involved in a collision with a tugboat, and in 2019 she struck a fixed structure at the Langdale terminal. The 2019 crash lead to passengers being stranded on the vessel for over ten hours.

The ship has a maximum draught of . As of 2018 the vessel was remeasured with a gross tonnage (GT) of 6,968.91, a net tonnage of 4,473.47 with a length of , a beam of and a depth of . Queen of Surrey is propelled by two MaK 12M551AK diesel engines rated at driving two propellers, one forward and one aft. This gives the vessel a maximum speed of . The ship has a capacity of 308 cars and 1,494 passengers and crew. In place of individual cars, Queen of Surrey is capable of loading twelve semi-trailer trucks. The vehicle deck is divided into three sections with two longitudinal casings. The deck has of headroom. Four lanes in the centre of the deck can be used by trucks or cars, while two outboards lanes and two lanes on the gallery deck are for cars only, and reached by fixed ramps. On the upper deck, there are eight lanes for cars, reached only from a shore-based ramp. Amenities aboard the ferry include a Coastal Cafe, Coast Cafe Express, gift shop, kids zone, video zone, pet area, elevators and accessible washrooms. Mid-life upgrade In 2006, Queen of Surrey underwent a $40 million mid-life upgrade iat the Washington Marine Group's Vancouver Drydock in North Vancouver. The project prepared the vessel for another 20 years of service with significant mechanical and safety improvements, as well as upgraded passenger amenities and the installation of new emergency evacuation equipment. Major work included steel replacement, electrical upgrades, and modernization of elevators, heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. Remodelled and expanded areas included the gift shop, food service facilities, washrooms, and seating areas. Construction and career The vessel was ordered in May 1979, and constructed by Burrard Yarrows Corporation at their yard in North Vancouver, British Columbia and given the yard number 100. The ferry cost US$29.0 million to build. Queen of Surrey was launched on August 27, 1980, and delivered to BC Ferries in April 1981. The vessel was assigned the Horseshoe Bay to Langdale route. On May 12, 2003, the vessel was disabled in Howe Sound as a result of a diesel oil fire in the No.2 engine room. Queen of Capilano was sent to aid the damaged vessel and tethered to Queen of Surrey while tugboats were dispatched. The vessel was then towed back to shore. None of the 318 passengers were injured, but several crew members were treated for minor injuries. Some buckling of the main car deck resulted from the heat of the fire. However, no vehicles were damaged in the incident. Inferior copper piping and the removal of a heat shield in the engine room were identified as the main causes of the fire. She returned to service on July 17, 2003. On July 31, 2003, the vessel experienced a mechanical problem with one of her propellers. As a result, she was removed from service for emergency dry- docking to facilitate repairs, which took about five days. On January 11, 2004, Queen of Surrey collided with the tugboat Charles H. Cates V at Horseshoe Bay, trapping the tugboat between the ferry and the dock. Charles H. Cates V sustained significant damage, but made it to Vancouver Harbour to undergo repairs. In October 2005, the ferry collided with the dock at Tsawwassen, British Columbia after the captain misjudged the wind and tides. In 2006 the ferry underwent a mid-life upgrade. She returned to service on June 27, 2006. On September 8, 2010, thieves attempted to steal an automated teller machine (ATM) from the ferry while Queen of Surrey was docked overnight at Gibsons, British Columbia. During the attempted theft, the thieves dropped the ATM into the water. The ATM was later recovered. On June 30, 2017, the ferry suffered minor damage after a driver drove their Chevrolet Blazer SUV through the dock gates and launched the vehicle onto the ferry's car deck. On March 26, 2019 Queen of Surrey missed the berth at Langdale terminal and struck the Stormaway dock. The vessel then became stuck and was subsequently incapable of disembarking the passengers and vehicles aboard. A tugboat was called to assist the ferry in maneuvering to the terminal to allow foot and vehicle passenger to disembark after being stuck for nearly ten hours. The vessel was eventually dislodged from the terminal after part of the lower car deck was cut away.

P. Lovecraft. Written August 1925, it was first published in Weird Tales, September 1926. Plot The story's anonymous narrator has moved from New England to New York City, and greatly regrets it. One night, while wandering through a historic part of Greenwich Village, he happens upon a man dressed in garments from the 18th century. The man offers to show the narrator the secrets of the town. The man brings the narrator into his home. There, he tells him the story of a squire who bargained with Native Americans for the secrets of their rituals concerning time and space, which were practiced on the land where the squire had recently taken up residence. After learning these secrets, the squire killed the Native Americans by giving them \\"monstrous bad rum\\". Within a week all of them were dead, and he alone had their secret knowledge. The man shows the narrator visions of the city's past and future so terrifying that he begins to scream wildly. The screams rouse the spirits of the Native Americans to take vengeance on the man, who is the same squire from 1768. Inspiration The story \\"He\\" was written after an all-night tour of the remnants of Old New York; by 7 a.m. the next morning, Lovecraft had reached Elizabeth, New Jersey, by ferry, where he bought a dime composition book and wrote the story in Elizabeth's Scott Park. Lovecraft had moved to New York City in March 1924 for his short-lived marriage to Sonia Greene. He moved back to Providence, Rhode Island in April 1926, having developed a thorough aversion to New York. The opening paragraphs of \\"He\\" are believed to be largely autobiographical,David E. Schultz, \\"Lovecraft's New York Exile\\", Black Forbidden Things, pp. 52-54. expressing Lovecraft's own feelings about the city: Lovecraft's disgust for New York stemmed in large part from his racist attitudes, which are also reflected in \\"He\\"'s narrator: The court off Greenwich Village's Perry Street actually exists; Lovecraft learned of its existence in a New York Evening Post article of August 29, 1924. The stranger's house is apparently based on a mansion on the block bounded by Perry, Bleecker, Charles and West 4th streets, built as early as 1744 and demolished in 1865. A suggested literary model for \\"He\\" is Lord Dunsany's The Chronicles of Rodriguez, in which a wizard displays visions of past and future wars in successive windows.

Greenbank had worked on a dozen shows with each of Monckton and Ross from 1900 to the time of The Boy, and Talbot and Thompson were also frequent collaborators of theirs in the first two decades of the 20th century.\\"Percy Greenbank\\" at the British Musical Theatre website, accessed 31 December 2009 The plot of The Boy closely follows that of The Magistrate, although character names have been changed, and some of the original dialogue is retained. In the Play Pictorial feature, B.W. Findon's review of the musical praised the singing of Nellie Taylor and Peter Gawthhorne, and the comedy of W. H. Berry, as well as the production in general.Findon, B.W. (ed.) \\"The Boy\\", The Play Pictorial, No. 186, Vol. XXXI, 1917, pp. 33–35 Synopsis Australian sheet music to \\"Little Miss Melody\\" ;Act I Mrs. Millicent Meebles, a remarried widow, habitually understates the age of her son, Hughie Cavanaugh, to make herself appear several years younger. Consequently, the 19-year-old lad is taken for a 14-year-old boy and appears to be precocious. Hughie, that \\"Sporty Boy\\", flirts with astonishing skill with his beautiful music teacher. ;Act II Hughie also precociously introduces his step-father, Mr. Meebles, a magistrate, to the nightclub in the Cosmos Hotel. They are followed by Millicent, who wishes to warn a friend not to divulge the boy's true age. When the nightclub is raided by the police, Mr. Meebles escapes without capture, having a comically difficult time. Mr. Meebles arrives at court just in time to hear the case that results from the raid and must, as magistrate, sentence his wife and sister-in-law, Diana Fairlie (whose lover is Albany Pope), to incarceration. Fortunately, a fellow magistrate, Mr. Burridge comes to the ladies' rescue by over-ruling the sentence on a technicality. At home, Millicent confesses that she has exaggerated Hughie's age. All is forgiven.  Productions  The Boy opened at the Adelphi Theatre in London on 14 September 1917, directed by Robert Courtneidge, under the management of Alfred Butt. The production ran for 801 performances – one of the longest runs of any musical theatre piece up to that time.Gaye, p. 1529 An Australian production opened at the Theatre Royal in Melbourne on 23 October 1920, starring Arthur Stigant, Lance Lister and Gladys Moncrieff, where it ran until 22 January 1921. The production later toured to Sydney, where it opened at Her Majesty's Theatre on 17 December 1921, and then Adelaide in November 1922.\\"Her Majesty's: 'The Boy'\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, 11 February 1922, p. 16 It was adapted for Broadway as Good Morning, Judge in 1919, by the same creative team, at the Shubert Theatre, running for 140 performances and then touring successfully.Good Morning, Judge, IBDb database, accessed 23 October 2011 Two songs by George Gershwin were added to the score, including \\"I am so Young\\", published as \\"I was so Young (You were so Young).\\"Pollack, Howard.

For example, many birds mate for a breeding season or sometimes for life. They may share some or all of the tasks involved: for example, a breeding pair of birds may split building a nest, incubating the eggs and feeding and protecting the young. The term is not generally used when a male has a harem of females, such as with mountain gorillas. True breeding pairs are usually found only in vertebrates, but there are notable exceptions, such as the Lord Howe Island stick insect. True breeding pairs are rare in amphibians or reptiles, although the Australian Shingleback is one exception with long-term pair-bonds. Some fish form short term pairs and the French angelfish is thought to pair-bond over a long term. True breeding pairs are quite common in birds. Breeding pair arrangements are rare in mammals, where the prevailing patterns are either that the male and female only meet for copulation (e.g. brown bear) or that dominant males have a harem of females (e.g. walrus).

The complex is adjacent to University Avenue, one of the major public roads that serve the university and define its boundaries. It was the university's first residence area and the last one to become co-ed. The Murphree Area complex is named for Albert A. Murphree, the second president of the university, who served from 1909 to 1927. It consists of the following five residence buildings, all built between 1905 and 1939: *Buckman Hall (1906) *Thomas Hall (1906) *Sledd Hall (1929) *Fletcher Hall (1939) *Murphree Hall (1939) Early history (1906-1939)  Buckman Hall and Thomas Hall were the first two university buildings to be built, and were dedicated on September 27, 1906. Buckman Hall was named for Henry Holland Buckman, the member of the Florida Legislature who wrote the Buckman Act, which created the modern University of Florida in 1905. Thomas Hall was named for Gainesville mayor William Reuben Thomas who supported the donation of of land and $40,000 from Gainesville to the state so that the Florida Legislature would build the university in Gainesville rather than in Lake City. The buildings are constructed of brick, have three and a half floors, and are late Gothic Revival-Tudorbethan in style. The buildings were designed by architect William Augustus Edwards of the firm of Edwards and Walters, then based in Columbia, South Carolina, and were built by Jacksonville-based contractor W.T. Hadlow at a cost of $75,250 per building. Both buildings were designed for student housing but have served many uses, and in their early history were used to house the entire university. Buckman Hall contained a six-bed infirmary, gymnasium, and an apartment for a professor (the \\"officer-in-charge\\"). Thomas Hall contained administration offices in the north section, classrooms, laboratories, an auditorium, a library, a dining room, and a kitchen in the center sections, and an agricultural laboratory in the south section. Both buildings had hardwood floors and potbellied stoves (for which the university provided wood for students to burn). In 1906, students paid $2.50 in rent to live in the halls. The collections of the Florida Museum of Natural History were for a time displayed at Thomas Hall. In 1911, final plans were made for the construction of four additional buildings: an agriculture building (Floyd Hall), the University Commons Building (Cafeteria), the language hall (Anderson Hall), and the College of Education building (Peabody Hall). When these facilities were completed in fall 1913 (after a delay in funding for the Language Hall and Education Building), parts of Thomas Hall were left vacant, and Thomas Hall was renovated for use as a residence hall, opening in 1914. Later history (1940-2000) In 1940, Thomas Hall was linked to Fletcher and Sledd Halls, forming a \\"UF\\" shape that can be seen from the air. From 1940 to 1949, the interiors of Buckman and Thomas Halls were renovated, and the wood structures were replaced by steel and concrete, at a cost estimated to be between $37,000 and $54,000. In 1974, Thomas Hall was added to the National Register of Historic Places, with the register reading :1905–1906, Edwards and Walters, architects. Brick, 3½ stories, H-shaped, hipped and pitched roof sections; crenulated parapet interrupted by stepped gables placed over a division, each with its own entrance and bay window; regular fenestration, stone quoins, elaborate arched large stone scroll brackets; connected to another building at E end of S wing. Late Gothic Revival. One of first 2 buildings on University of Florida campus. A press release issued when Thomas Hall was added to register told the story of the campus legend of \\"Old Steve,\\" the ghost who haunts Murphree Area, the last all-male residence area (it was designated co-ed in 1972). According to the legend, \\"Old Steve\\" was the original head cook on campus who worked in the kitchen in the center of Thomas Hall, beneath the classrooms and library. The legend states that Old Steve disrupted the campus through his shouting and cursing at his kitchen crew, the banging of pots and pans, the hissing of steam, and the loud crackling of fire and pans as lunch was prepared--the same sounds heard when the steam heating system in the Murphree Area halls is turned on every fall. Present day (2001-present) Increased electrical demands of students put heavy burdens on Thomas Hall, draining power and causing circuit overloads and thrown breakers, with four to six residents sharing a 15-amp service. In 2000, a $2.5 million four-year electrical upgrade project began with the aim of providing at least one 20-amp circuit per student. The project required total rewiring of the halls--from transformers to each outlet and switch--and the installation of a new 23,000-volt primary distribution switch. In 2002, a $500,000 project to landscape the university’s historic area (the Murphree Area courtyard and University Avenue area) began when Florida alumni Herb and Catherine Yardley of Fort Lauderdale gave $250,000 to be matched by the university. Landscape architecture students at the university assisted in the design, which includes proposed sidewalks, landscaping plants and design, walls, and seating areas. Thomas Hall is co-ed by section and occupied by 170 residents.

The company Eletromotores Jaraguá was created on 16 September 1961 by Werner Ricardo Voigt, Eggon João da Silva and Geraldo Werninghaus (respectively an electrician, an administrator and a mechanic). Years later changed its name to Eletromotores WEG SA, the name WEG being formed with the first letter of each founder's first name. Initially producing electric motors, WEG started diversifying its activities during the eighties, with the production of electric components, products for industrial automation, power and distribution transformers, liquid and powder paints and electrical insulation varnishes. The company grew into a global motor manufacturer. In 1968, WEG created CentroWEG, a training center to aid in the lack of qualified professionals in the area of mechanical engineers. In May 2008, WEG announced a new factory in India. In February 2012, the Canadian manufacturer Ballard Power Systems signed a deal with WEG to assess the market opportunities for hydrogen PEM fuel cell products and services in applications. In February 2019, WEG acquired Energy Storage System, the storage business of US-based Northern Power Systems (NPS). WEG had previously bought the utility-scale turbine business of NPS in 2016.

It is bounded on the north by St. Clair Avenue West, on the east by Spadina Road, on the south by the CP railway tracks, and on the west by Bathurst Street. Transit access is provided by the TTC's St. Clair West station and 512 St. Clair streetcar route. History The area's name comes from Casa Loma, a Gothic Revival mansion in the neighbourhood. The mansion was completed in 1914. Casa Loma was constructed in the early 1900s for over three million dollars and was given to the city by its heavily debt- laden owner only a decade after it was put up. The prominence of the mansion led to a huge boom in the area, with many wealthy residents setting up shop and defining the present neighbourhood. Demographic The following data relates only to census tract 5350118.00. Income distribution is interesting to take into consideration due to the large majority of affluent residents in this neighbourhood. The income distribution data collected by Statistics Canada through the census in 2006 indicates that there are 900 people making under $19,999. The population was 3,900 in 2006, therefore, the 900 people in the income bracket aforementioned makes up 23% of the population within this area. To acknowledge the changes over time, it is also important to take into consideration the data collected by Statistics Canada in the 2011 census. In 2011, the population decreased from 2006 by 303 people to 3,597. The number of people in the neighbourhood making under $19,999 in 2011 was 945. Therefore, between 2006 and 2011, there was an increase of 45 people in the low income bracket for census tract 5350118.00. Because the population decreased between 2006 and 2011, and the number of people in the low income bracket increased, in 2011, the percentage of the people in the low income bracket (making under $19,999) made up 26% of the population living in census tract 5350118.00.

Kurama was named after Mount Kurama located north of Kyoto, Japan. On 28 August 1912, the Ibukis were re-classified as battlecruisers. Background Ibuki was designed with geared turbine engines which promised more power and hence, more speed; however, problems with these engines led Kurama to be completed with conventional vertical triple expansion reciprocating engines. Kurama was built at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal. Service history Shortly after commissioning, Kurama, with Admiral Hayao Shimamura on board, was sent on a voyage to Great Britain to attend the Coronation Fleet Review for King George V at Spithead on 25 June 1911. Kurama served in World War I as part of Japan's contribution to the Allied war effort, protecting British merchant shipping in the South Pacific, and (together with the battlecruisers and ) supporting the landings to occupy German-held Caroline Islands and Mariana Islands. In the 1920s, she was assigned to the northern fleet, covering the landings of Japanese troops in Russia during the Siberian Intervention in support of White Russian forces.

History Having been released 32 years after the .270 Winchester, it had somewhat unspectacular sales. Remington renamed the cartridge in late 1978 to 7mm-06 Remington but just before the end of the year they renamed it again calling it the 7 mm Express in an attempt to increase sales. This resulted in people confusing it with the 7 mm Remington Magnum, and Remington changed the name back to .280 in 1981.The Versatile 280 at Outdoor Life By Jim Carmichel, September 18, 2007 Specifications The .280 is based on the .30-03 necked down to accept 7 mm (.284 in) bullets, with the neck moved forward .050 in (1.27mm). The neck was deliberately moved forward to prevent chambering in a .270 Winchester rifle, as firing a .280 round in a .270 rifle could cause the projectile to get stuck in the barrel or rupture the barrel due to excessive pressure. Original loads were 125, 150 and 165 grain bullet weights. .280 Remington vs .270 Winchester The .280 Remington is capable of generating slightly higher velocities in heavier bullet weights (150 grains and above) than the .270 Winchester due to a marginally greater case capacity. However the ballistic coefficient of equal weight bullets favors .270 caliber bullets over 7mm (.284) bullets of similar design. In the heavier bullets (150 grains and above) of similar design the .280 Remington has a slight edge in muzzle energy. With equal weight bullets of similar design the .270 Winchester surpasses the .280 Remington's long range velocity and energy due to the 270's higher ballistic coefficient according to Federal's ammunition catalog. There are also many more factory loads available for the .270 Winchester over the .280 Remington at a lower price point due to the .270's much greater popularity. .280 vs .30-06 The .280 Remington is capable of developing energy nearly equal to the .30-06 Springfield, but with lighter bullets having a better ballistic coefficient. The .30-06 produces more energy than the .280 with bullets heavier than 180 grains, though .284\\" 175 grain bullets have a high sectional density of .310, compared to the 30-06 180 grain bullet with a moderate sectional density of .271. The .280 is suitable for hunting any game in North America with good shot placement. SAAMI pressure limit for the .280 Remington is set at 60,000 PSI, 50,000 CUP. Most American rifle and ammunition manufacturers catalogue the .280 Remington. In Europe the .280 Remington is not popular in bolt action rifles since it competes directly with the 7×64mm, which is of the almost exact same size as the .280 Remington but has slightly more power, because of having a slightly higher maximum allowed chamber pressure. The .280 Remington does, however, have a larger than expected number of European users in imported self-loading rifles such as those by Remington. The .30-06 is substantially more popular and manufacturers thus offer a much greater selection of loads at a substantially lower price point. While it is true that a .280 Remington case can be formed from a .30-06 Springfield case, the case length of a .30-06 is while the case length of a .280 is , the same as a .30-03 Springfield. However, \\"The slight difference in length of reformed cases doesn't make any practical difference.\\" Speer Reloading Manual Number Ten (1979), p. 182 .280 Ackley Improved .280 Ackley Improved on the right One of P.O. Ackley's earliest wildcats was the 7mm-06 Improved, which was made by necking down the .30-06 Springfield case and fire-forming it to have less body taper and a 40-degree shoulder angle. Soon after the .280 Remington came out, Fred Huntington reformed its case to an improved configuration with minimum body taper, a 35-degree shoulder angle, and called it the .280 RCBS. Since cases for the .280 RCBS could be formed by firing .280 Remington ammo in a rifle chambered for the former, Ackley abandoned the 7mm-06 Improved and started chambering rifles for the .280 RCBS. He then changed the 35-degree shoulder to 40-degrees and the .280 Ackley Improved was born. If barrel length and chamber pressure are equal, the .280 Ackley Improved is about 100 fps faster with all bullet weights than the standard .280 Remington. In 2007, ammunition manufacturer Nosler registered the .280 Ackley Improved with SAAMI and began providing factory loaded ammunition and rifles for it.

There are also design requirements for passengers to be able to evacuate within certain limits; typically 90 seconds for large aircraft. An evacuation slide is an inflatable slide that both allows people to descend safely from the exit and has a sufficiently high use rate to meet the evacuation timings. Escape slides are the reference means of compliance with the regulation although some cargo aircraft use different methods. History The first aircraft evacuation slide was developed and produced by Air Cruisers, founded by James F. Boyle, inventor of the World War II life vest, the \\"Mae West\\". Air Cruisers History The patent for the inflatable escape chute assembly was submitted by Boyle in 1954 and the designs was patented in 1956 under patent number 2,765,131. Today Air Cruisers is part of Zodiac Aerospace and ultimately owned by Safran who are the world's largest provider of evacuation slides. Prior to inflatables, some passenger aircraft utilized canvas type slides which required the crew to undertake an extensive rigging procedure. Canvas type slides are still found on some out of production Russian aircraft.  Types of Slide  There are four types of inflatable aircraft evacuation aid covered by EASA Technical Order: Type I- Inflatable Slide Type II- Inflatable Slide/Raft Type III- Inflatable Exit Ramp Type IV- Inflatable Exit Ramp/Slide Type I Slides and Type II Slide/Rafts both function the same on land allowing descent from the door to the ground. A slide/raft also functions as a life raft in a landing on water and therefore are required to include sea survival specific features such as; an erectable canopy, righting aids and survival packs containing items such as leak stoppers, paddles and flares. Even where only a Type I slide is fitted it has sufficient buoyancy to act as an aid in the event of a water landing. A Type III inflatable ramp is a small platform that may be fitted to allow easy assess from, for example, an over-wing wing exit door to an area of structure from where descent can be achieved either by a separate slide or by jumping, depending on the height. Type IV combines the ramp and slide into a single functional unit. The over-wing exits on the Airbus A320 series, Airbus A380, Boeing 747, Boeing 757 and Boeing 767 aircraft use ramp slides in various configurations. Slides can be single or dual lane, depending on the width of the exit they are fitted to and in testing must show a nominal exit rate of 70 people per minute per lane. A dual lane slide is one that is capable of carrying two parallel lines of evacuees and is typically used at the main doors on Widebody aircraft. Slides and slide/rafts can be detached from the aircraft. This may, for example, involve lifting up the flap on the girt bar, and pulling the detach handle. These procedures are usually placarded red on the slide, \\"For Ditching Use Only\\". Once the slide is separated, the slide remains attached to the aircraft by a mooring line. This line will break if the airframe submerges, or can be disconnected with a pre- supplied knife or disconnect handle. Another unique type of evacuation slide is found on the DC-9 family of aircraft and its successors the MD-80 and Boeing 717. This type of slide is in the aircraft's tailcone, and deploys after the tailcone is jettisoned by flight attendants, allowing for evacuation through the rear of the airframe. The procedure to use this exit may involve removing a plug-type pressure bulkhead, or a swing type door that leads directly to a walkway. At the end of the walkway is the slide pack and a manual tailcone jettison handle for use if the tailcone has not already been automatically jettisoned by opening the walkway entrance. One of the newest developments in evacuation slide technology can be found on the Airbus A380, which was developed by Goodrich Aircraft Interior Products. Certain slides on board the aircraft have the Tribrid Inflation System, which is connected to a sensing system within the door. If the door is opened in emergency mode at an abnormal attitude (e.g. nose up position due to the loss of landing gear), the slide will inflate normally but will also inflate several feet of additional slide to ensure the slide reaches the ground. This contrasts with the Boeing 747 as doors found on that aircraft have no such system; should the slide not reach the ground, the doors must be blocked to prevent passenger injury. Main Door Exits Slides fitted by main fuselage doors are mounted on the door itself. This packaging is normally inside in a slide bustle, a protruding part on the inside of an aircraft door that varies with aircraft size, door size and door location. At wide doors typical on large aircraft these will be \\"dual lane\\" slides capable of carrying two parallel lines of evacuees. To reduce evacuation time, evacuation slides deploy automatically when a door is opened in an \\"armed\\" condition. Various forms of indicators, such as lights, flags and pins with ribbons are used to indicate an armed condition. Over- wing / window exits Deflated evacuation slide on an Airbus A320 following an inadvertent deployment, 2007 All large commercial aircraft have escape slides on the main doors but some also have slides for exits over the wings. These include the Boeing 767, Boeing 757, and Airbus A320-series aircraft. Typically, overwing evacuation slides are not designed for use in ditching situations as they cannot be detached. and will not operate, as the system is disabled by the aspirators on the slide taking in water. Aircraft where there is no over-wing slide, such as the Embraer 190, 717, and 737 do not require them by regulation because when the flaps are fully lowered, they are low enough to the ground to meet the requirement. Window exits usually come in two configurations: *An unhinged hatch type exit, where the hatch is unlocked from the inside and pulled into the cabin, whereupon it can be disposed. Some carriers recommend placing the hatch onto the adjacent seats, while others may recommend dropping it in the next seat row, or rotating the exit and throwing it outside the aircraft as far forward as possible. A manual inflation handle for the evacuation slide, if equipped, can be found in the window frame. Most aircraft overwing exits are of this type. * A hinged self-disposing exit hatch, that opens automatically outward using a spring when the exit handle is pulled. This exit design was designed in response to research generated after the Manchester air disaster in 1985 which indicated that unhinged hatch type exits were difficult to open by untrained passengers. This design is currently found only on Boeing 737 NG aircraft. Window exits are usually equipped with ditching or life lines. These may be attached to the inside frame of the window exit, or located in a nearby storage locker. One end has a buckle to connect to attachments on the aircraft's wings. A packed evacuation slide Evacuation slide in the box at the bottom of the door Operation SSJ100 Prior to departure (usually before engine startup), all the aircraft doors are placed into the armed (or automatic) mode by the cabin crew. Methods of arming vary from aircraft to aircraft, but ultimately the girt bar (a metal bar attached to the door end of the slide) is physically attached to brackets either in or adjacent to the door sill. On older aircraft, such as the Boeing 737, this is done physically by the cabin crew and on most other aircraft it involves pushing a lever on the door itself which arms the door internally. If a rapid evacuation is required and the doors are opened while \\"armed\\", the opening of the door pulls the slide pack out of the bustle (because the girt bar is physically attached to the aircraft floor). Due to the weight of both the door and the slide, great effort is involved in pushing the door open sufficiently to free the slide from the bustle, thus on larger aircraft a \\"power assist\\" function kicks in to aid the opening, either electrically or from compressed gas. Once the slide is completely free it will fall under gravity and after travelling a certain distance a pin will be pulled from a squib containing compressed gas and the slide will inflate. Should this system fail, the slide can be manually inflated by the cabin crew by pulling a manual inflation handle at the top of the slide. Should this also fail, standard operating procedures require the cabin crew to send passengers away from the door and to one that has a functioning escape slide. Some Russian-built aircraft like the Tupolev Tu-154 have a very complicated process to activate and deploy the slides. The slides are stored in cabinets usually beside the emergency exit inside the aircraft. They are usually about the same width and height as a seat. To activate the slide, one must pull the front cover to a 90 degree angle, then pull the slide out so it is lying flat on the floor or door sill, open the emergency exit and kick or push it out. Gravity will then pull the slide to the ground and it will inflate. Aircraft safety cards and in-flight safety demonstrations show the passengers where the nearest emergency exits are and how to use the evacuation slides. Additionally, Flight Attendants receive extensive safety training that covers the use of evacuation slides. Usage An article in Time by Amanda Ripley, with the assistance of aviation safety expert Dan Johnson, compiled some tips on how to avoid injury and escape from a plane on an inflatable slide. Their suggestions involved planning, exiting the aircraft and getting off the slide quickly, jumping, the correct body position and avoidance of clothing that could cause safety issues, such as spiked heels and pantyhoses.\\"How to Escape Down an Airplane Slide\\" Amanda Ripley. Time. January 23, 2008. Retrieved August 2, 2012. Inadvertent deployment A stand-alone device installed on the back of the door. Emergency slides after the crash of British Airways Flight 38 Inadvertent slide deployment occurs when the operator of the aircraft door attempts to open the door when it is in the armed position. This costs the industry millions in lost revenue every year, estimated at $20 million in North America by cabin crew alone. A device can be used to prevent this problem. It works by sounding an audible alert (voice) when the door operator, whether trained or not, is about to open the door in the armed position. It works as an independent system, requiring no action other than arming the door as per normal standard operating procedures. When the door is placed in the armed position, the device is armed. It can be installed as a stand-alone unit or integrated into the aircraft systems and powered from aircraft power. Inflation systems Both slides and slide/rafts use non-explosive, inert gas inflation systems. The FAA requires evacuation of the entire aircraft in 90 seconds using 50% of the available evacuation exits. To meet this, all evacuation units need to deploy in less than 10 seconds. For large, wide body aircraft such as A380s and B747s a successful deployment is complete in about five to seven seconds, depending on conditions (such as temperature and winds). The inflation system usually consists of a pressurized cylinder, a regulating valve, two high pressure hoses and two aspirators. The cylinder's volume can be between , pressurized to about with either gaseous Nitrogen (N2), or a mixture of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and Nitrogen. Once made of steel, most cylinders now are made of aluminum or alloy cores wrapped with fiberglass, or other lightweight, fuel saving materials. The CO2 is used to slow down the rate at which the valve expends the gases. The regulating valve mechanically meters out the gas at a pressure of roughly and a rate of about per minute. Typically there are two high pressure hoses attached to the valve, which are connected at the other end to aspirators. These are usually cylindrical, hollow aluminum tubes with sliding cylindrical or internal flapper doors that open when high pressure gas is applied, and close when the gas stream subsides and the internal slide back pressure reaches about 2.5 - 3.0 psi. They work on the Venturi principle, and draw outside air into the evacuation unit at a rate of about 500:1. A gas cylinder can fill a slide with about of air to a pressure of about in about four to six seconds. For the slide to deploy correctly, it is packed in a manner that has the aspirators directly under the outer cover. The entire, self-contained slide pack is approximately wide, long and about high, depending on aircraft type. In the center, forward part of the pack, a multi-layered piece of heavy urethane or neoprene/nylon fabric, called the girt, is left hanging out to a length of about . When installed in the aircraft, a girt bar is put through the center, outside end of the girt and attached to the interior floor, just inside and in front of the exit door. On the face of the girt are instructions in large red lettering, and a handle with the word 'PULL' on it. This is rarely used however, because the lanyard attached to the handle runs through the girt to the valve, which is several inches too short when the girt is extended fully. When the slide is in the armed position and the door is opened, the slide pack falls free of the door bustle (a semi-rigid outer container) and the weight and momentum of the slide pulls the lanyard from the valve, initiating the flow of gas. At about the same time, a metal pin that holds the center of the Valise closed is also pulled, releasing a daisy chain and the two halves of the cover. When the cover is released and the inflation system activated, the two aspirators come shooting out of the pack, gulping vast quantities of air and restrained only by the fabric tubes to which they are securely fastened. To compensate for any wind, new evacuation slides contain internal baffles, which cause the ends nearest the aircraft to inflate first, which are constructed to come out like four elbows and press against the fuselage of the aircraft to the forward and aft sides of the exit door. There are also half- tie restraints which keep the inflating slide from drooping or blowing under the aircraft. These restraints are constructed so that when the slide becomes fairly rigid, at around , they detach very quickly (there are usually two), and since the header tubes are already against the fuselage, the slide pops almost horizontally out from the door, then drops relatively gently to the ground. Tests in cross winds have shown these deployment systems to be very effective. Independent of the inflation system, all slides are equipped with at least one pressure relief device per inflation chamber. This protects the chamber from catastrophic failure due to over pressurizing. (Typically, modern slides are made of at least two inflation chambers, and should be able to evacuate an aircraft even when one chamber loses all pressure.) All new evacuation slides are tested on a mock-up of an aircraft exit door and filmed prior to being certified as airworthy and delivered to a customer. Also, new units are usually constructed of urethane materials and impregnated or coated with an aluminized coating so that the slide will survive for a short while even if fire is nearby. Older slides are yellow and made of neoprene/nylon fabric. Exempted aircraft Airplanes such as the Embraer 145 family, Fokker 50 family, Antonov An-148 family, ATR family and the Bombardier CRJ family do not have escape slides because all exits are at a distance from the ground (less than ), below which evacuation assisting devices are not required by regulations. On the primary entrance door, 1L, some of these aircraft have stairs that are either connected to the door or drop down.

His older brother, lyricist Harry Greenbank, had a brilliant career in the 1890s that was cut short by his death at the age of 33. Percy picked up where his brother had left off, writing lyrics for some of the most popular musicals from 1900 through World War I and even afterwards. Life and career Greenbank was born in London, son of Richard and Mary Greenbank. He was Harry Greenbank's younger brother. Percy studied law, but instead decided to become a journalist, contributing to such journals as Punch, The Sketch and The Tatler, and to write for the theatre.Gaye, p. 672 Cover of Vocal Score After Harry's death, George Edwardes asked the younger Greenbank to collaborate with Adrian Ross on the lyrics for The Messenger Boy and also interpolated two of his lyrics into San Toy when that score was revised (\\"Somebody\\" and \\"All I Want is a Little Bit of Fun\\"). He began to collaborate with composers Ivan Caryll and Lionel Monckton, as well as with Ross and the deviser of the Gaiety show plots and outlines, James T. Tanner.\\"Percy Greenbank\\" at the British Musical Theatre website, accessed 31 December 2009 For the remaining 14 years of the Edwardes era Greenbank worked at the Gaiety Theatre, London, Daly's Theatre and later the Adelphi Theatre, contributing sometimes much and sometimes only a few lyrics to most of Edwardes's shows, including hits like The Toreador (1901), A Country Girl (1902), The Orchid (1903), The Earl and the Girl (1903), Lady Madcap (1904), Véronique (1904), The Cingalee (1904), The Little Michus (1905), The Spring Chicken (1905), The Girl Behind the Counter, (1906), The New Aladdin (1906), The Three Kisses (1907), Our Miss Gibbs (1909), The Quaker Girl (1910), The Dancing Mistress (1912) and The Girl From Utah (1913). During this time, he also produced shows at other theatres, such as Three Little Maids (1902), My Lady Molly (1902), Lady Madcap (1904), The Blue Moon (1905), See-See (1906), The Belle of Brittany (1908), A Persian Princess (1909), Princess Caprice (1912) and To-Night's the Night (opening in New York in 1914). Sheet music from The Boy After Edwardes' death in 1915, Greenbank continued for a further decade to supply lyrics and occasionally libretti to the musical stage, including such shows as Houp La! (1916) and the hit musical The Boy (1917), only rarely venturing into the world of revue (Half Past Eight and Vanity Fair). His last major work for the West End was the adaptation from the German of what was to become the book to the Jean Gilbert and Vernon Duke musical Yvonne.Gänzl, p. 817 He subsequently did occasional work as a play doctor (El Dorado) or an adapter through the 1920s. He modernized San Toy with Percy J. Barrow for its 1931 revival, but slowed down into a long retirement. Greenbank died in Rickmansworth, north west of London, in 1968 at the age of 90, and as a result, the Edwardian musical comedies to which he contributed remain in copyright in the UK until 2039.

It is a member of the belted magnum family that is directly derived from the venerable .375 H&H; Magnum.Speer Reloading Manual The original purpose of the belted magnum concept taken from the .300 H&H; Magnum and .375 H&H; Magnum, was to provide precise headspace control, since the sloping shoulders, while easing cartridge extraction, were unsuitable for this purpose. Improved cartridge extraction reliability is desirable while hunting dangerous game, which would be of concern when needing a fast follow up shot. The 7mm Remington Magnum is based on the commercial .264 Winchester Magnum, .338 Winchester Magnum, and .458 Winchester Magnum, which were based on the same belted .300 H&H; Magnum and .375 H&H; Magnum cases, trimmed to nearly the same length as the .270 Weatherby Magnum. On its introduction, the 7mm Remington Magnum substantially usurped the market share held by the .264 Winchester Magnum, which went into sharp decline in popularity and sales after 1962..264 Win Mag data from Accurate Remington has offered Managed Recoil ammunition for achieving reduced recoil when shooting and for generating less meat damage when hunting smaller game. Design The 7mm Remington Magnum offers ballistics better than the .30-06 Springfield with all available bullet weights, one of the more popular loads being a 160 grain spitzer loaded to . This is due both to the higher muzzle velocity of the magnum compared to the Springfield and that .284 diameter bullets tend to have better ballistic coefficients than .308 diameter bullets of comparable mass. Because of the smaller bullet diameter .284 diameter also have higher sectional density than .308 diameter bullets, and because of that better penetration in the target (it takes a 206 grain .308 diameter bullet to get the same sectional density as a 175 grain .284 bullet, an increased weight that requires 15-20% more muzzle energy to get the same muzzle velocity). The heaviest commercially loaded ammo available for the 7mm is 180 grains, while the .30-06 Springfield can be loaded with bullets up to 220 grains, but for a .308 caliber to equal the flat trajectory and penetration of a .284 diameter 180 grain bullet with a muzzle velocity of 2,860 ft/sec, as offered for the 7mm Remington Magnum, requires muzzle energy close to what the .300 Winchester Magnum can offer, i.e. well beyond what the .30-06 can deliver. Cartridge dimensions The 7mm Remington Magnum has 5.31 ml (82 grain) H2O cartridge case capacity. 400 px 7mm Remington Magnum maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions. All sizes in millimeters (mm).C.I.P.

The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 241 mm (1 in 9.49 in), 6 grooves, Ø lands = 7.04 mm, Ø grooves = 7.21 mm, land width = 2.79 mm. The cartridge uses a large rifle magnum primer type. According to the official C.I.P. (Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives) rulings, the 7mm Remington Magnum case can handle up to Pmax piezo pressure. In C.I.P. regulated countries every rifle cartridge combo has to be proofed at 125% of this maximum C.I.P. pressure to certify for sale to consumers. This means that as of 2016, 7mm Remington Magnum chambered arms in C.I.P. regulated countries are proof tested at PE piezo pressure.C.I.P. TDCC sheet 7 mm Rem. Mag. The SAAMI maximum average pressure (MAP) for this cartridge is piezo pressure.ANSI/SAAMI Velocity & Pressure Data: Centerfire Rifle Use left Because of its flat shooting nature and the relatively tolerable recoil, the 7mm Remington Magnum is especially popular for big game hunting in Canada and in the United-States, as well as for use on plains game in Africa. It has also been chambered in sniper rifles as the US Secret Service counter-sniper team has deployed this cartridge in urban areas along with the .300 Winchester Magnum. Popular online gun author Chuck Hawks calls the 7mm Remington \\"one of the great all-around rifle cartridges.\\"The 7mm Remington Magnum by Chuck Hawks Alternative cartridges The 7mm Winchester Short Magnum cartridge, a rebated rim bottlenecked centerfire short magnum introduced in 2001, is probably the closest ballistic twin of the 7mm Remington Magnum. The 7mm Winchester Short Magnum is considerably shorter and fatter and has a steeper shoulder angle and a shorter neck (6.17 mm) than the 7mm Remington Magnum. This makes the 7mm Remington Magnum case with its 6.89 mm long neck better suited for loading long heavier bullets. On the other hand, the proportions of 7mm Winchester Short Magnum promote good internal ballistic efficiency that allows the 7mm Winchester Short Magnum to fire shorter lighter bullets at slightly higher muzzle velocities while using less propellant than the classically proportioned 7mm Remington Magnum. The commercially rarer 7mm Remington Short Action Ultra Magnum cartridge, a rebated rim bottlenecked centerfire short magnum introduced in 2002, is probably the other closest ballistic twin of the 7mm Remington Magnum. The 7mm Remington Short Action Ultra Magnum is considerably shorter and fatter and has a steeper shoulder angle and a longer neck (7.90 mm) than the 7mm Remington Magnum. This makes the 7mm Remington Short Action Ultra Magnum better suited for loading long heavier bullets. These 21st century ballistic twin short fat magnum cartridges can handle Pmax piezo pressure according to the C.I.P. or a maximum average pressure of piezo pressure according to the SAAMI. Choice of bullet and barrel length Bullet choice when reloading is critical, as bullet velocity at close ranges may result in less robust bullets disintegrating without providing significant penetration on especially tough game.Fackler, Martin L., \\"Wounding Patterns of Military Rifle Bullets\\", International Defense Review, 1989, pp. 59-64 Thus one would do well to use a premium bullet of some sort, for instance a bonded bullet. The choice of barrel length is also critical, as a barrel is commonly needed to achieve the full velocity potential of the cartridge, and a barrel should be viewed as a practical minimum. This is because in shorter, i.e., sporter, barrels, of approximately , the cartridge ballistics deteriorate to much the same as those achieved in a .270 Winchester, while generating more recoil and muzzle blast than the .270 Winchester.

He is best known for his collection of poems, ‘’Songs of the Musconetcong’’, published in 1968. Life A.M. Sullivan grew up in the northern New Jersey mining town of Oxford. His formal education ended with his graduation from St. Benedict’s Prep School in Newark in 1913. In 1919, he married Catherine Veronica McNamee and remained with her until her death in 1968. She bore him two daughters, Catherine and Mary Rose. The couple lived in St. Albans, New York until moving to Montclair, New Jersey in 1953. Throughout this time, they summered in an 1840s house on the Musconetcong River near Hackettstown, New Jersey. This river and the wooded hills of northern New Jersey provided much of the inspiration for his poetry, which drew heavily on themes of nature. Proud of his Irish heritage, Mr. Sullivan was a board member of the Irish- American Historical Society. He made several trips to Ireland throughout his later life and became proficient in Gaelic. In recognition of his literary achievement, A.M. Sullivan received honorary doctorates from Montclair State College and St. Edward's University. Many of his papers and a collection of his poetry books are held at Syracuse University. He died in Montclair on June 10, 1980. Career After a series of odd jobs, Sullivan went to work for the Submarine Boat Corporation in Port Newark, New Jersey in 1917 where he began the company’s in-house magazine, ‘’Speed Up’’. In 1932, Sullivan joined Dun & Bradstreet and soon moved into the position of Advertising and Public Relations Director. Later, he became editor of Dun’s Review and Modern Industry to which he contributed articles related to business ethics, philosophy and management style. During this same period, he continued to write and publish works of poetry. Sullivan retired from Dun and Bradstreet in 1971. Poetry Sullivan's first collection of poems, Sonnets of a Simpleton was published in 1924. He went on to publish thirteen volumes of poetry through 1970. A. M. Sullivan's poetry reflects his broad interests, which included nature, technology, history, religion and science. Many of his poems have appeared in textbooks, magazines, audio recordings, radio chorale and films. From 1932 to 1940, A.M. Sullivan hosted The New Poetry Hour on WOR radio in New York City. This program was broadcast on the Mutual Network and featured live interviews and readings with over 300 poets and writers, including Edgar Lee Masters, Padraic Colum, Stephen Vincent Benét, William Rose Benét, Mark Van Doren, John Hall Wheelock, Harriet Monroe, MacKinlay Kantor and many others. Sullivan was medaled by the Poetry Society of America on two occasions (1941 and 1976) and served as president for five terms. He was a member of The Craftsmen, a poetry society in New York City, President of the Catholic Poetry Society and a recipient of the Alexander Droushkoy Memorial Gold Medal (1951). One of his collections of poems, Songs of the Musconetcong, was honored by a resolution of the New Jersey State Senate in 1968 and a biographical film of the same name was made and broadcast by New Jersey Public Television in 1979.

Today's South Bend Lathe corporation is the successor to the original South Bend Lathe Works, an American machine tool builder that for many decades was one of the most important builders of metalworking lathes in the U.S. and in the world. The South Bend Lathe Works was established in 1906 in South Bend, Indiana by identical twin brothers John J. O'Brien and Miles W. O'Brien.Inside cover and page 3 of 1916 South Bend Lathe Works catalog. By 1930, the company was building 47% of the engine lathes sold each year in the United States.South Bend Lathe History per South Bend Lathe website In a quarter century, South Bend Lathe Works had become the largest exclusive manufacturer of metalworking precision lathes in the world. In the 1920s through 1960s, South Bend lathes were found in countless machine shops and factories, and they were also one of the most commonly used brands in vocational schools. The 9-inch lathe was so successful that many other companies made almost direct copies (clones), including the Boxford Lathe Model A in England; Purcell, Demco, and FW Hercus in Australia; Blomqvist and Storebro in Sweden; and Sanches Blanes S.A. in Brazil. The company made a case study for business-management academics during the mid-1970s when it became employee-owned under an Employee Stock Ownership Plan model. Later South Bend Lathe became a division of LeBlond Limited, which is part of the Makino corporation, a multinational machine tool–building firm. In 2009, the brand was sold to Shiraz Balolia, founder of the machinery firms Grizzly Industrial Inc. and Woodstock International Inc. Under LeBlond, South Bend Lathe still produced precision machine tools, although it was not the giant of market share that it once had been during the 1920s through 1950s. The new owner, Balolia, planned to redevelop and manage the brand as one that appeals to the demand for high-end quality that many South Bend Lathe enthusiasts share. A new line of South Bend brand machine tools is now sold through Grizzly dealers. Their niche in the manual-control machine tool market is what marketers sometimes term the \\"mass luxury\\" segment of a market, where low-end affordability blends into high-end desirability in a combination that buyers sense highest value. One of the classic marketing examples is Buick's market position between Chevrolet and Cadillac. In South Bend Lathe's case, the affordability of machine tools from Taiwan or China mixes with the desirability of certain German and Japanese components (such as spindle bearings) and higher standards (compared to many Taiwanese or Chinese brands) in terms of tolerances, inspection, features, and rigidity.

P. Lovecraft.\\"H. P. Lovecraft's original fragment, 'Azathoth'\\" It was written in June 1922 and published as a fragment in the journal Leaves in 1938, after Lovecraft's death. It is the first piece of fiction to mention the fictional being Azathoth, one of the major entities in Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, though the entity only appears in the title. Plot The story begins by describing how the modern world has been stripped of imagination and belief in magic. The protagonist is an unnamed man who lives in a dull and ugly city. Every night for many years the man gazes from his window upon the stars, until he comes over time to observe secret vistas unsuspected by normal humanity. One night the gulf between his world and the stars is bridged, and his mind ascends from his body out unto the boundless cosmos. Inspiration Lovecraft described his planned novel as a \\"weird Eastern tale in the 18th century manner\\" and as a \\"weird Vathek-like novel\\", referring to a novel of Arabia written by William Thomas Beckford in 1786. Suggesting that his story would involve \\"material of the Arabian Nights type\\", he wrote that Though Lovecraft likely never got past the 480-word fragment that survives, he later wrote a novel with a similar theme, The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath.

This design originated with the British gunmaker Holland & Holland for the purpose of headspacing certain more powerful cartridges. Non-shouldered (non-\\"bottlenecked\\") magnum rifle cartridges especially could be pushed too far into the chamber and thus cause catastrophic failure of the gun when fired with excessive headspace. The addition of the belt to the casing prevented over-insertion. An example of an American adaption of this practice is seen in cartridges like the .458 Winchester Magnum, also a shoulderless heavy magnum. Many subsequent cartridges of \\"magnum\\" nomenclature were based on the original .375 H&H; cartridge, so over time the belt became something of a standardized attribute, expected as part of a \\"magnum\\" cartridge. Many cartridge designs of the last century include this belt, but do not really require it. In the last decade or so, there has been a trend toward beltless magnums, virtually all of which are heavily shouldered designs that obviate the original motivation for a belt.

Dirtbag manufactures various styles of clothing including streetwear, rock-n-roll and urban clothing, hoodies, flex-fits, women's tee-shirts/babydolls, and accessories. The company's business model relies heavily on internet sales, social media, and marketing. Dirtbag was projected to reach $1.4 million in sales as of 2004. History Dirtbag Clothing was founded by partners Douglas Canning and John Alves during their final year as film majors at San Francisco State University. Instead of starting with a catalog like most clothing companies, Canning began with a website. From there, he went to the websites of independent record labels to get email addresses for bands that would fit his demographic and offered a 40% discount on those willing to wear their merchandise. In October 2008, Dirtbag re-launched its clothing site and added Jim Stroesser as CEO. Stroesser previously held senior executive positions at Nike, Oakley, Quiksilver, Pony and Converse. In November 2008, Dirtbag began offering a wide variety of t-shirts, hoodies, and headwear. In 2009, the company started Dirtbag Music- a record label led by owner partners Doug Whitsit and Mark Evans. The label became an overnight success when their first act, Seasons After, launched into the top 40 with the hit: \\"Cry Little Sister\\". Dirtbag Music then briefly partnered with Warner Independent Label Group as one of their subsidiaries. Dirtbag Music ceases to exist, and Dirtbag Clothing is no longer affiliated with Mark Evans. Revenues Dirtbag had sales of approximately $1 million in 2002, half coming through online purchases. As of 2004, Dirtbag's revenues were projected at $1.4 million.

Themes The novel is a story of both personal and political tragedy in the fictional Central American country of \\"Boca Grande\\". In 1983 Didion published Salvador, a book of essays on corruption and violence in El Salvador; the fiction and non-fiction reflect a similar perspective of rage and despair. Plot introduction The novel is narrated by Grace Strasser-Mendana, an American expatriate who married into one of the three or four families that dominate Boca Grande politics, the Mendanas. Grace was trained as an anthropologist under Claude Lévi-Strauss, and later took up the amateur study of biochemistry, both attempts to find clear-cut, scientific answers to the mysteries of human behavior. Both attempts fail: Grace remains uncomprehending and cut off from the people around her, and in the final line of the novel she admits, \\"I have not been the witness I wanted to be.\\" But Grace is not the novel's central character. That is Charlotte Douglas, another American woman sojourning in Boca Grande, although her family ties are elsewhere. Charlotte's beloved daughter Marin has run off with a group of Marxist radicals and taken part in an absurd act of terrorism, and in the wake of her daughter's disappearance, Charlotte's marriage to a crusading Berkeley lawyer (not Marin's father), has fallen apart.

Van Gogh arrived in Arles in February 1888 in a snowstorm; within two weeks the weather changed and the fruit trees were in blossom. Appreciating the symbolism of rebirth, Van Gogh worked with optimism and zeal on about fourteen paintings of flowering trees in the early spring. He also made paintings of flowering trees in Saint-Rémy the following year, in 1889. Flowering trees were special to Van Gogh; they represented awakening and hope. He enjoyed them aesthetically and found joy in painting flowering trees. The 'trees and orchards in bloom' paintings that he made reflect Impressionist, Divisionist and Japanese woodcut influences. Flowering trees and orchards When Van Gogh arrived in Arles in February 1888, the area's fruit trees in the orchards were about to bloom. The blossoms of the apricot, peach and plum trees motivated him, and within a month he had created fourteen paintings of blossoming fruit trees. Excited by the subject matter, he completed nearly one painting a day. Around April 21 Van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo, that he \\"will have to seek something new, now the orchards have almost finished blossoming.\\" Flowering trees represented a source of spiritual renewal for Van Gogh; in 1883 he had written of the symbolism of the flowering tree, seeing the evidence of rebirth like the \\"man who finally produces something poignant as the blossom of a hard, difficult life, is a wonder, like the black hawthorn, or better still the gnarled old apple tree which at certain moments bears blossoms which are among the most delicate and virginal things under the sun.\\" In 1888 Van Gogh became inspired in southern France and began the most productive period of his painting career. He sought the brilliance and light of the sun which would obscure the detail, simplifying the subjects. It also would make the lines of composition clearer; which would suit his ambition to create the simple patterns that he appreciated in Japanese woodblocks. Arles, he said, was \\"the Japan of the South.\\" Van Gogh found in the south that colors were more vivid. Pairs of complementary colors, such as \\"the red and green of the plants, the woven highlights of oranges and blue in the fence, even the pink clouds that enliven the turquoise sky\\" — create an intensity through their pairing. Mancoff says of flowering trees and this work, > \\"In his flowering trees, Vincent attained a sense of spontaneity, freeing > himself from the strict self-analytical approach he took in Paris. In Almond > Tree in Blossom, Vincent used the light, broken strokes of impressionism and > the dabs of colour of divisionism for a sparkling surface effect. The > distinctive contours of the tree and its position in the foreground recall > the formal qualities of Japanese prints.\\" The southern region and the flowering trees seems to have awakened Van Gogh from his doldrums into a state of clear direction, hyper-activity and good cheer. He wrote, \\"I am up to my ears in work for the trees are in blossom and I want to paint a Provençal orchard of astonishing gaiety.\\" While in the past a very active period would have drained him, this time he was invigorated. To paint the flowering orchards, Van Gogh contended with the winds which were so strong that he drove pegs into the ground to which he fastened his easel. Even so, he found painting the orchards \\"too lovely\\" to miss. Flowering orchard triptych Van Gogh may have envisioned several triptychs of his paintings of orchards and flowering trees. However, only one triptych grouping has been documented, one which Vincent envisioned and sketched for Theo's apartment. Johanna van Gogh-Bonger displayed them in the apartment according to Van Gogh's sketch, the vertical Pink Peach Tree between the Pink Orchard and the White Orchard. Pink Orchard In Paris, Van Gogh had learned to paint more than what one sees, but what it should be. He felt Pink Orchard was an example of wise use of that technique, such as leaving a field blank behind the orchard to create the feeling of distance. The way in which he outlined the bark of the tree indicates influence of the Japanese prints that he greatly admired. Using an Impressionist technique of placing colors side by side, Van Gogh makes short dots or brush strokes of colors to represent grass. On the top of the tree he uses rougher, more impasto brushstrokes to represent the colorful blossoms. Vincent asked Theo to \\"shave off\\" some of the impasto in this painting. Apparently he did not reline, a process of heavy pressure and heat to flatten the surface, because sharp edges of thick impasto remain on the canvas. Pink Peach Tree In the Pink Peach Tree, center of the triptych, the bright pink in the painting has faded over time and looks more white than pink now. Van Gogh wrote of his approach, perhaps due to the challenges of painting in the mistral winds, and use of color in painting the flowering tree like the Pink Peach Tree: > \\"At the moment I am absorbed in the blooming fruit trees, pink peach trees, > yellow-white pear trees. My brush stroke has no system at all. I hit the > canvas with irregular touches of the brush, which I leave as they are. > Patches of thickly laid-on color, spots of canvas left uncovered, here and > there portions that are absolutely unfinished, repetitions, savageries… > Working direct on the spot all the time, I try to grasp what is essential in > the drawings -- later I fill in the spaces which are bounded by contours — > either expressed or not, but in any case felt — with tones which are also > simplified, by which I mean that all that is going to be soil will have the > same violet-like tone, that the whole sky will have a blue tint, that the > green vegetation will be either green-blue or green-yellow, purposefully > exaggerating the yellows and blues in this case.\\" White Orchard Continuing on with his paintings of orchards, Van Gogh wrote, \\"At the moment I am working on some plum trees, yellowish-white, with thousands of black branches.\\" Two days later he wrote of the same painting, \\"This morning I worked on an orchard of plum trees in bloom; all at once a fierce wind sprang up, an effect I had seen nowhere else but here, and returned at intervals. The sun shone in between, and all the little white flowers sparkled. It was so lovely. My friend the Dane came to join me, and I went on painting at the risk and peril of seeing the whole show on the ground at any moment - it's a white effect with a good deal of yellow in it, and blue and lilac, the sky white and blue.\\" File:Vincent van Gogh - De roze boomgaard - Google Art Project.jpgThe Pink Orchard also Orchard with Blossoming Apricot Trees March 1888 Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F555) File:Vincent van Gogh - De roze perzikboom - Google Art Project.jpgPeach Tree in Blossom March–April 1888 Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F404) File:Vincent van Gogh - The white orchard - Google Art Project.jpgThe White Orchard April 1888 Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F403) Center piece for a second triptych: Blossoming Pear Tree Blossoming Pear Tree, 73 x 46 cm, March 1888, Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F405) Van Gogh chose Blossoming Pear Tree as the center piece of a grouping, However, there is no information linking this painting to any others. The Van Gogh Museum described Van Gogh's approach and technique when he made Blossoming Pear Tree: > He chose a high vantage point, creating a contrast between the angular trunk > and branches with their dark, heavy contours and the light background. A > stone wall and a few trees can be seen to the rear, while to the left is a > fence in front of a garden near a pink-yellow house. The large, flat yellow > butterfly among the flowers to the right of the trunk is also noteworthy. > The decorative painting, with the small tree in the foreground, the high > vantage point and the lack of depth, is strongly influenced by the art of > the Japanese printmakers, which Van Gogh admired enormously. It is difficult to overstate the impact that Japanese art had on Van Gogh. In a letter to Theo, he said, \\"All my work is in a way founded on Japanese art, and we do not know enough about Japanese prints. In decadence in its own country, pigeonholed in collections already impossible to find in Japan itself, Japanese art is taking root again among French Impressionist artists.\\" Specific trees Almond Tree in Blossom Van Gogh writes of the weather and that the almond trees are coming into full flower, \\"The weather here is changeable, often windy with turbulent skies, but the almond trees are beginning to flower everywhere.\\" The rendering of Almond Tree in Blossom is positioned close and accessible to the viewer, and the branches appear to extend beyond the painting's frame. A yellow butterfly flits among the pink blossoms growing on the red branches. The subject is reminiscent of an earlier painting which Van Gogh made in Paris depicting flowering trees. Apricot Trees in Blossom was made in April 1888. It is now held in a private collection.

This may be the painting that Van Gogh referred to as one with a great deal of stippling that depicts an orchard surrounded by cypress trees. If so, Van Gogh intended it to be paired with another painting of the same size. =Pink Peach Tree, Souvenir to Mauve= Van Gogh wrote of Pink Peach Tree in Blossom (Souvenir de Mauve) that he completed in March, \\"I have been working on a size 20 canvas in the open air in an orchard, lilac ploughland, a reed fence, two pink peach trees against a sky of glorious blue and white. Probably the best landscape I have done. I had just brought it home when I received from our sister a Dutch notice in memory of Anton Mauve, with his portrait (the portrait, very good), the text, poor and nothing in it a pretty water color. Something - I don't know what - took hold of me and brought a lump to my throat, and I wrote on my picture, 'Souvenir de Mauve'.\\" Van Gogh knew Anton Mauve during his stay in The Hague. Mauve had taken an interest in Van Gogh and encouraged him to work in color. Van Gogh asked that Pink Peach Tree be sent to Mauve's widow Jet. To his sister Wil, Van Gogh explained that he chose the particular painting because of the \\"delicate palette\\" to express his deep fondness. \\"It seemed to me that everything in memory of Mauve must be at once tender and very gay, and not a study in a graver key.\\" =Watercolor of Pink Peach Trees= Image:Vincent van Gogh - De roze perzikboom - Google Art Project.jpgPink Peach Tree in Blossom (Reminiscence of Mauve) March 1888 Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo (F404) File:Van Gogh - Blühender Obstgarten mit Pfirsichbäumen.jpegOrchard with Peach Trees in Blossom April, 1888 Private collection (F551) File:Pink Peach Trees.jpgPink Peach Trees, watercolor April 1888 Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F1469) Orchard in Blossom (Plum Trees) The National Gallery of Scotland described Orchard in Blossom (Plum Trees): > The structure of the branches of the plum trees is still clearly visible > through the blossom and his brushstrokes follow the direction of the > vertical tree trunks. The presence of the glittery white blossoms and absence of leaves indicate that Van Gogh made this painting shortly after the tree flowered. The painting reflects Impressionist influences in the use of short brush strokes and projection of light.

Patches of thickly laid-on colour, spots of canvas left uncovered, here or there portions that are left absolutely unfinished, repetitions, savageries; in short, I am inclined to think that the result is so disquieting and irritating as to be a godsend to those people who have preconceived ideas about technique.\\" In the same letter he made a sketch of Orchard in Bloom, Bordered by Cypresses, \\"the entrance to a Provençal orchard with its yellow fences, its enclosure of black cypresses (against the mistral), its characteristic vegetables of varying greens: yellow lettuces, onions, garlic, emerald leeks.\\" File:Van Gogh - Blühender Obstgarten, von Zypressen umgeben.jpegOrchard in Blossom, Bordered by Cypresses April, 1888 Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo (F513) File:Van Gogh - Blühender Obstgarten von Zypressen umgeben1.jpegOrchard in Blossom, Bordered by Cypresses April, 1888 Private Collection, promised to Yale University Art Gallery (F554) Other flowering orchard paintings Orchard in Blossom (F406) Orchard in Blossom (F406) was painted for Theo for May Day with \\"a frenzy of impastos of the faintest yellow and lilac on the original white mass.\\" To his friend Émile Bernard he provided more detail: \\"Here is another orchard, rather simple as a composition: a white tree, a small green tree, a square patch of green, lilac soil, an orange roof, a large blue sky.\\" Orchard in Blossom (F511) The Van Gogh Museum's version of Orchard in Blossom was painted in April. Vincent asked Theo to \\"shave off\\" some of the impasto in this painting. Apparently he did not reline, a process of heavy pressure and heat to flatten the surface, because sharp edges of thick impasto remain on the painting. View of Arles, Flowering Orchards Van Gogh painted View of Arles, Flowering Orchards in spring 1889. It provides a view across a canal, with poplar trees along its banks, toward the historical center of Arles, with the towers of Saint- Trophime and Notre-Dame-le-major to the left, contrasted by recent building of the casern housing the Zouave Regiment to the right. Van Gogh incorporated this painting in his selection of works to be displayed at Les XX, in Brussels 1890. Flowering Orchard The Metropolitan Museum of Art notes that Flowering Orchard is one of only two orchard paintings from Van Gogh's orchard series that alludes to human labor, in this instance by including a scythe and a rake. Japanese influence is understood from Van Gogh's stylized treatment and motif. The painting is also known as Orchard in Blossom, another English translation of its French title.

This espionage case became something of a cause célèbre in France in 1986, as Boursicot and Shi were brought to trial, owing to the nature of the unusual sexual subterfuge alleged.Hawthorne, Melanie C. \\"Du Du That Voodoo\\": M.

Accessed via PDF download on 14 November 2011 The case was again back under a public spotlight when a play loosely based on this affair, M. Butterfly by David Henry Hwang, premiered in 1988 and yet again as the film adaptation of the play directed by David Cronenberg was released in 1993. Periodic restagings of the play and television airings of the film based on it continue to spark interest in the espionage case at the heart of the fictional works of art. Early life Boursicot was born in 1944. He attended boarding schools as a youth, where he engaged in multiple homosexual affairs with other students; upon graduation, Boursicot became determined to have sex with a woman for the first time, believing that institutionalized homosexuality among boarding students was merely a rite of passage. He first met Shi Pei Pu in China while posted to the French Embassy in Peking as an accountant in 1964. He was 20 years old and Shi was 26. They met at an embassy reception and shortly began a relationship.KPBS On Air Magazine (August 1993), \\"M. Butterfly” at North Coast Repertory Theatre (Accessed 15 December 2019). Reporter Joyce Wadler, who wrote the book Liaison about the affair, would later attribute Boursicot's belief that Shi was a woman to Shi's unique ability to retract his own testicles, which, combined with the manipulation of his own penis, created the illusion of labial lips and a clitoris and allowed for shallow penetration.The True Story of M. Butterfly; The Spy Who Fell in Love with a Shadow ny Joyce Wadler Published: 15 August 1993 NEW YORK TIMES Magazine. Accessed online 14 November 2011 Spy In 1965, Shi claimed to be pregnant and was able to use a baby boy called Shi Du Du (later called Bertrand by Boursicot and his family) who had been bought from a doctor in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region of China.Time.com, World Notes Spies - Why Not Sort of Pregnant?, (October 2006) Over the next decade, they continued their on- again off-again affair as Boursicot moved from posting to posting in Southeast Asia. During this period Boursicot embraced his own bisexuality, having multiple liaisons with women while also engaged in a long term relationship with a Frenchman named Thierry, with whom he one day hoped to form a family including Shi Pei Pu and Bertrand. Boursicot has stated that he began passing documents to Shi when the Chinese Cultural Revolution made it difficult for him to see her. He was approached by Kang Sheng, a member of the Chinese secret service who offered him access to Shi in exchange for his passing documents. He believed Shi's safety was at risk if he failed to participate. Return to France, trial and aftermath Boursicot returned to France in 1979 and lost contact with Shi. In 1982, Boursicot was able to get the now 16-year- old Shi Du Du out of China and to Paris, where they lived as a family. Boursicot was questioned by authorities and confessed to having passed at least 150 classified documents to Shi. In 1983, Boursicot and Shi Pei Pu were arrested for spying for China. The prosecution then dramatically revealed Shi's real sex to Boursicot. He refused to believe it until he was permitted to see proof in the form of Shi's body. Not long after, he attempted suicide while in prison but was unsuccessful. In 1986, after a two-day trial, Boursicot and Shi were convicted of spying against the French government. Each received a sentence of six years in prison. Shi was pardoned in 1987. After his release, Shi remained in Paris, where he enjoyed his notoriety and performed as an opera singer. Boursicot, released four months after Shi, was last reported to be living contentedly with Thierry and has apparently made peace with the nature of his relationship with Shi. Shi Pei Pu and Shi Du Du had no contact with Boursicot until Shi's death in 2009. In Shi's obituary, it was reported that Shi Du Du was living in Paris and believed by Boursicot to have a family with three sons.  Cooperation with Joyce Wadler, author of Liaison Boursicot cooperated fully with reporter Joyce Wadler, who was seeking information for her book on the espionage case and affair, Liaison, granting her lengthy interviews about deeply personal subjects as well as access to all records and his closest family members. He is frequently quoted in the book. In a separate but lengthy article published in The New York Times Magazine in 1993, titled \\"The True Story of M. Butterfly; The Spy Who Fell in Love with a Shadow,\\" Wadler reveals in intimate detail how Boursicot came to believe the fiction that Shi Pei Pu was a woman despite having first come to know him socially and in a close friendship as a man. Boursicot related through Wadler that Shi first told him the story of an opera about a Chinese girl who swaps clothing with her brother so she may be educated. She falls in love with another student but is called home to participate in an arranged marriage. The male student is driven to suicide and eventually the girl does the same at the grave of her true love. The opera is called the Story of the Butterfly. Boursicot reported that it is only when he had the opportunity to leave his dull job that Shi Pei Pu told him the Story of the Butterfly again with an added twist that he, Shi Pei Pu, had been a woman masquerading as a man all his life to prevent her father from taking a second wife and shaming her mother who had two older daughters. Upon Shi's birth, this fiction was created. Boursicot accepted the lie, their affair began, and all that came after ensued. Boursicot's and Shi Pei Pu's public comments regarding their affair  In his obituary, it was reported that Shi Pei Pu disliked answering questions about the sexual specifics of the affair; in 1988 he was quoted in an interview as having said, \\"I used to fascinate both men and women. What I was and what they were didn't matter.\\"Shi Pei Pu, Singer, Spy and ‘M. Butterfly,’ Dies at 70 By JOYCE WADLER Published: 1 July 2009 New York Times. Accessed online 14 November 2011. About the affair, Boursicot is quoted as saying, \\"When I believed it, it was a beautiful story.\\" However, when Boursicot was notified at a French nursing home of Shi's death, Boursicot said, \\"He did so many things against me that he had no pity for, I think it is stupid to play another game now and say I am sad.

The episode follows Stewie, who develops a tan, but becomes obsessed with his new look and attempts to keep it, eventually stopping after being told by the doctor he may now have cancer. Meanwhile, Peter discovers Chris being tormented by a bully, and after a series of events, becomes a bully himself. The episode was written by Mark Hentemann and directed by Julius Wu. It received mostly mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 8.53 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Mike Barker, Jeff Bergman, Chris Cox, Michael Clarke Duncan, Keir Gilchrist, Beth Littleford and Rachael MacFarlane, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. Plot While babysitting Stewie, Peter takes him along on an all day golf game and Stewie ends up with a tan all over his body. Stewie decides he likes being tanned and begins frequently to use a tanning bed in his room. He also holds a party for tanned people only. Stewie tells Brian to wake him up after fifteen minutes of tanning but Brian falls asleep and wakes up six and a half hours later. Stewie is extremely sunburned, barely able to move and in great pain. When Stewie eventually begins to peel, Brian spots a mole on Stewie's stomach. Convinced it is skin cancer, Stewie begins to live out his dying wishes with Brian forced to help him since it was partially his fault he caused the cancer in the first place (though Stewie solely blames him). One of Stewie's requests was to visit the Chicago Museum of Art. As his last request he has Brian record his final thoughts. In the end, Stewie hears from Dr. Hartman that he does not have cancer and gives up tanning. Stewie then sees that Brian drew himself being hanged instead of his final thoughts, prompting the baby to quip \\"Oh, you are just the worst type of person\\". Meanwhile, Chris learns that his best customer, Herbert, has made Kyle, a neighbor's son and a bully, his new paper boy. Chris decides to confront them both but ends up getting pushed over by Kyle and laughed at by Kyle's friends subsequently returning home in tears much to Peter and Lois' concern. Peter goes to talk with Kyle who makes fun of him over and over. Unable to control his anger toward Kyle, Peter beats him up leaving Kyle bleeding and bruised. Kyle’s mother agrees not to press charges if Peter apologizes to Kyle which he reluctantly does. Kyle easily forgives him, saying he would have done the same and commenting on how good bullying makes you feel, encouraging Peter to become a bully. Peter splashes a pot of boiling water over Lois and makes her punch herself in the face. He also hits Stewie on his sunburned buttocks, knocks Chris out of his chair, and sticks his large butt out at Meg to fart repeatedly in her face following her backwards around the kitchen table until she finally trips and vomits on the floor at which Peter gets mad with her. When Peter also bullies his friends, such as using Joe as a marionette and pulling Cleveland's pants down, Lois points out that he is as bad as his old school bully, Randy Fulcher. Deciding he should bully him instead, Peter finds Randy who is now suffering from multiple sclerosis. Thinking, when Randy says “I have MS,” that he is bragging that he has a monkey’s scrotum, Peter is about to beat up Randy but is stopped by Chris who beats Peter up instead and finally convinces him bullying is wrong. As the event is witnessed by a wrong sounding Kermit the Frog and a wrong sounding Swedish Chef, a wrong sounding Fozzie Bear (voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan) asks them if they want to hear a joke as the episode ends. Production David Goodman comments, regarding the plot partially following Herbert that \\"there is always a bit of trouble pitching a Herbert storyline to the network.\\" Samm Levine had originally been selected to voice Kyle, but the character was recast because, as show producer Seth MacFarlane comments, \\"it seemed a lot funnier when Peter was beating up a kid if he was younger and more defenseless.\\" A deleted scene had been made which showed Chris asking for money and stating \\"I spent my last ten bucks on a ham costume,\\" and Peter replying with \\"it's just sitting there right now, but you know what the great thing is, it's just three months until Halloween and I am done.\\" Peter's ancestor shown preparing to wrestle with a kangaroo was described by Seth MacFarlane to be \\"a very strange gag,\\" which was added after the other parts of the episode had been created. Quagmire's profanity- laced tirade during the golf game was bleeped out on TV, but uncensored on DVD. The scene of Stewie remembering the time the Griffins had a nymphomaniac from Wisconsin in their attic was edited as FOX objected to the sounds of the woman having an orgasm being shown over a shot of a wide-awake Stewie. American Dad! producer Mike Barker returned as a guest voice actor. The voice of a guest at the tanning-party which Stewie is hosting was provided by Mike Barker. David A. Goodman comments on the DVD commentary that \\"It's nice to hear Mike Barker back on Family Guy.,\\" as Barker had performed multiple voices of characters in previous episodes. Peter asking \\"I'm going to prison, aren't I?\\" when hiding in the tree after beating up Chris's bully caused a little bit of trouble for the show, though it was never edited when aired on TV. A sketch had been created showing Brian falling asleep when watching Late Night with Bib Fortuna while Stewie was still in the tanning booth, but it did not seem good enough to air, so it was never broadcast. When Stewie is being sprayed by Brian with sun-screen, Ralph Furley enters the room and mistakenly thinks he sees Brian ejaculating on Stewie. The cream was originally intended to keep squirting out of the bottle as if Brian were continuing to ejaculate despite Mr. Furley's presence, but the animation didn't look right and was removed. MacFarlane comments that he was amazed that broadcasting standards allowed them to get away with the scene, even though Brian's line, \\"This isn't what it looks like\\" was edited to keep the ejaculation illusion from being blatant (the TV version goes from Mr. Furley yelling, \\"Brian\\" and Brian reacting to Mr. Furley running out and saying, \\"Never mind, I'll come back later!\\"). A deleted scene was made and designed to happen directly after Peter sickens Meg by farting in her face in which Peter steals Chris's lunch money and runs for the bus. The gag showing Dick Cheney as a Wal-Mart greeter had Cheney's greeting, \\"Go fuck yourself\\" bleeped out on TV, but not DVD. Peter falling to the floor after being pushed away from hitting Randy by Chris was very difficult to do, as it is difficult to do slow-motion in animation. The DVD version includes an extra scene in the car, in which Peter shows Chris how he looks like an anus by wearing a hoodie, pulling the hood on the drawstring tight around his mouth, and pushing a chocolate candy bar out of the hole to simulate defecation. In addition to Barker and the regular cast, actor Jeff Bergman, voice actor Chris Cox, actor Michael Clarke Duncan, actor Keir Gilchrist, actress Beth Littleford and voice actress Rachael MacFarlane guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors Chris Sheridan, writer Danny Smith, writer Alec Sulkin and writer John Viener made minor appearances. Actor Patrick Warburton also has a guest appearance as well. Cultural references * Stewie is listening to the instrumental version of I Say A Little Prayer while tanning. * An unused ending to the episode had been similar to the ending of 1984 American comedy film Revenge of the Nerds, but \\"it never really clicked,\\" hence, it was not broadcast. * Stewie at a party with other tan-obsessed people is a reference to the Tony Lacey scene in Annie Hall. * Stewie reciting a poem he wrote to Brian is a reference to non-fiction novel Tuesdays with Morrie. * While Peter is confronting Kyle, Kyle begins imitating Peter's voice in a childish way. Peter replies to this by saying that Kyle makes him sound like Michael Stipe: The then-lead singer of rock band R.E.M. * Stewie and Brian visiting the Art Institute of Chicago as one of Stewie's last wishes is a reference to Ferris Bueller's Day Off. * There is a dispute between Peter and Lois in regards to how different LEGO is from Mega Bloks. * While Stewie is tanning, he begins to sing his own version of the Kokomo (song) by The Beach Boys. * A parody of Kellogg’s Frosted Flakes’ Tony the Tiger called Terry the Tiger is seen in the Griffin kitchen, saying “They’re food!” * When Lois notices Stewie's sunburn, she tells Peter that it was similar to the time he fed his Mogwai after midnight. A cutaway scene shows Peter feeding the Mogwai a drumstick, causing it to turn into Fran Drescher, whose head Peter then microwaves. * When Lois wipes off Stewie's fake pencil mustache, Stewie compares the saliva being cleaned on his upper lip to the time he had dinner with Martin Landau. A cutaway shows Martin Landau having a distinct speech pattern by not chewing up his food as he speaks. * When Brian advises Stewie to “wait and see” whether or not he has cancer, Stewie says “Jim Henson had a wait and see attitude, and look what happened to him. Now we’ve got wrong-sounding Muppets,” a reference to Henson’s deadly Streptococcus pneumoniae infection that was discovered too late which led to his death in 1990. The scene then cuts to Kermit the Frog and the Swedish Chef in a dialogue sequence, with much different voice tones. The two would later appear at the end of the show, discussing the preceding events, when Fozzie Bear walks in, and says in a deep voice (supplied by actor Michael Clarke Duncan): “Wocka wocka. Who wants to hear a funny-ass joke?”. * When Peter realizes that he should bully Randy Fulcher, he compares this to Dick Cheney being a Wal-Mart greeter. He greets each customer with \\"Go fuck yourself\\", a reference to a 2004 incident where he said those words to Senator Patrick Leahy, after he asked the vice president about Halliburton's alleged war profiteering. * When Stewie gets off his beach chair during a tan, Stewie is seen drinking a can of TaB, and then slowly looking to the camera – a parody of TaB commercials in the '80s. * The title of the episode \\"The Tan Aquatic with Steve Zissou\\" is a reference to the 2004 Wes Anderson movie \\"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou\\". Reception In a significant improvement over the previous week, the episode was viewed in 8.53 million homes in its original airing, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode also acquired a 3.0 rating in the 18–49 demographic, being slightly edged out by The Simpsons, while still winning over American Dad! and King of the Hill. Ahsan Haque of IGN gave \\"The Tan Aquatic with Steve Zissou\\" a 7.4/10 and commented \\"the random filler jokes just don't work, especially in this episode as both Jim Henson's Muppets and Frosted Flakes' Tony the Tiger are misused as random source material for jokes that simply fail to deliver,\\" adding that \\"The idea of Peter going overboard with his newfound desire to bully his family and friends is also not quite as funny as it could have been.\\" In a negative review by Brett Love of TV Squad. he noted \\"[the episode] was something of the opposite of \\"Peter's Two Dads.\\" Where that one excelled with the structure of the story, this one wasn't as strong.

The plot follows Peter feeling depressed at the prospect of becoming old, in which former U.S. president Bill Clinton appears and takes him out in Quahog, giving him a new outlook on life. Meanwhile, Stewie and Brian attempt to be toilet trained by buying an instructional video, but Brian persists to leave his feces in the garden, thus making Lois force him to wear a diaper. The episode was written by Steve Callaghan and directed by Dominic Polcino. It received mostly mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references, in addition to creating controversy, as many Hurricane Katrina evacuees complained over their city being portrayed as an \\"Atlantis\\" in the episode. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 8.05 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Barclay DeVeau, Roy Scheider and Wally Wingert, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. Plot After being attacked by an octopus at the aquarium, Peter decides to become physically fit. After spending a mere fifteen minutes at the gym, Peter believes he is now fit, so when former U.S. President Bill Clinton's car breaks down outside their house, he attempts to lift it without a jack, which results in him getting a sudden severe hernia and being hospitalized. Depressed at the concept of becoming old, he confides in Clinton, who tells him age is a state of mind. When Peter recovers, Bill takes him out to help him realize he can still have fun. They become best friends and spend a lot of time together, but things start to get out of hand when they start smoking marijuana and cause mischief while high on it. Believing that Bill is a bad influence on Peter, Lois goes to discuss with Bill the bad effect he is having on Peter, but ends up having sex with him. Devastated about the incident, Peter leaves Lois and stays at Quagmire's house. Lois is wracked with guilt and visits him, telling him that the only way to mend their relationship is if Peter sleeps with someone else. Though uncertain that it will work, Peter chooses to sleep with Barbara Pewterschmidt, Lois' mother. Barbara turns out to be more than willing, but Peter bails out at the last moment and tells Lois that he refuses to sleep with anyone else and they forgive each other. After going to tell Bill they cannot be friends anymore, Peter too is enticed into sleeping with Bill (inadvertently getting even with Lois). Meanwhile, Lois is fed up with stepping in Brian's feces on the lawn and forces him through toilet training himself. Brian and Stewie attempt to learn how to use the toilet, but fail. They buy a toilet training video presented by actor Roy Scheider, which nearly traumatizes them. Lois forces Brian to wear Stewie's diapers to prevent him from defecating in the garden; after that, she deals with Peter for the duration of the story. During the end credits, Brian pretends to be using the toilet as not to be told off by Lois, and begins to leave his feces at Mayor Adam West's house, which he believes is sausage that he planted in the ground. Production Seth MacFarlane provides the voice of Bill Clinton in the episode since Clinton himself turned down the role. \\"Bill & Peter's Bogus Journey\\" was written by Steve Callaghan and directed by Dominic Polcino. Series regulars Peter Shin and James Purdum acted as the supervising directors of the episode. Show creator Seth MacFarlane and other show producers had suffered a lot of trouble to come up with a funny scene set in an aquarium; in total, five or six scenes had been made, but all were never broadcast because they were deemed not entertaining enough by the producers. Bill Clinton was asked to perform the voice of himself, but declined, so MacFarlane performed it. Animations of Clinton in the episode were originally intended to be a lot fatter, but were reduced down \\"because he's lost a lot of weight.\\" Conway Twitty performed two songs in the episode; MacFarlane comments that he loves these scenes. The scene of Lois and Peter mocking Stewie's picture which he drew after pretending to like it was originally designed for \\"Prick Up Your Ears,\\" but was moved as that episode was exceeding its time limit. The two people typing on their laptops in Starbucks was a scene originally designed for the introductory sequence of \\"Chick Cancer\\", as was the scene of Peter having to push Uma Thurman's eyes back together when they move away from her head. The aftermath scene of Lois essentially sleeping with Clinton was discussed extensively in the writer's room for the effects it may have on the show. When Peter visits Bill, he enters the hotel room and says \\"Hey, Bill, I took this money from Lois's purse, but I don't think she'll notice because she is here... humping you?\\"; the emphasis on the last two words was performed by Danny Smith, even though MacFarlane voices Peter. A deleted scene was made showing Peter bringing Quahog news reporter Tricia Takanawa home to have sex with, originally intending to make Lois watch and then not being able to bring himself to do it, but this scene was deleted and replaced with Peter's wishes to sleep with Lois's mother. The final scene of the episode showing Mayor West delighted that he has grown sausages (although it is really Brian's waste) was one of several possible ending scenes for the episode; alternatives included Brian leaving his waste at Cleveland Brown and Mort Goldman's house, but in the end, the production crew decided to go with Mayor West. In addition to the regular cast, actor Roy Scheider played himself on the toilet training video, and voice actors Barclay DeVeau and Wally Wingert guest starred as various characters in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors and writers Danny Smith, Alec Sulkin, and John Viener made minor appearances. Recurring guest cast members Adam West and Patrick Warburton made appearances as well. Cultural references The title of this episode is a reference to 1991 film Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey. While Peter and Bill are hanging out at Chuck E. Cheese's, they play Dance Dance Revolution. We see a toilet-training instructional video narrated by comedian and actor Roy Scheider. Former President of the United States Bill Clinton was parodied in this episode. His request for a cigar after sleeping with Lois references his affair with Monica Lewinsky. We see amateur writers working at a Starbucks. Reception In a slight decrease from the previous week, the episode was viewed in 8.05 million homes in its original airing, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode also acquired a 2.8 rating in the 18-49 demographic, being slightly edged out by The Simpsons. This episode received yet more negative reception from the frequent critic Parents Television Council (PTC), calling it the \\"worst TV show of the week\\" for August 10, 2007. PTC said that the episode \\"treated audiences to another half-hour of the most depraved and disrespectful programming imaginable.\\" IGN's Ahsan Haque wrote, \\"Bill and Peter's Bogus Journey' has a few truly hilarious moments, but the main storyline ends up taking a backseat to an overabundance of unfunny manatee jokes,\\" concluding to give the episode a final rating of 7.1 out of 10.

Due to a mild climate, an abundance of water and alluvial soils, the area is well known for its wine production, lumber, dairy farming and poultry industries. The Hunter River flows through Singleton, and empties into the Pacific Ocean at the city of Newcastle.

Due to rising drug use among young people and within the counter-culture movement, government efforts to enforce prohibition were strengthened in the 1960s. Discovery In the spring and summer of 1963, attention was called to the presence of large amounts of Cannabis sativa growing on river banks, along creeks, and near irrigation channels in Hunter Valley. The New South Wales Department of Agriculture and Fisheries dispatched field officers to the affected areas to identify the plants. The discovery created a sensation in the press. One Sydney newspaper reported the find under the headline \\"Love Drug found in the Hunter Valley\\". The discovery also aroused much interest in the fledgling bohemian community. In April and May of each year of the infestation, small but determined bands of marijuana devotees evaded detection by police and land owners as they harvested the flowering tops of the plants. These individuals became known as weed raiders. Much of the resulting cannabis was then smuggled to Sydney, where it was dried, cured and illegally distributed. Marijuana smoking in Australia exploded in the next several years. Local dairy farmers demanded something be done to protect their valuable pasture lands from trespassers. The local chief of the New South Wales Police Force in the Hunter Valley publicly declared that the infestation would be eradicated \\"within six to eight weeks\\".

It originally aired on Fox on May 20, 2007. The episode features Peter after he goes back in time, in order to live the single life a little longer, before he meets future wife Lois. This causes Quagmire to make his own move on Lois, and they ultimately end up marrying and having children; Peter is horrified by this \\"alternate timeline\\" and resolves to go back in time again and set things right. The episode was written by Mark Hentemann and directed by Dan Povenmire and Chris Robertson. It received mostly positive reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 9.1 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Luke Adams, Jeff Bergman, Adam Carolla, Beth Littleford and Will Sasso, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. Plot After hearing Quagmire brag about his sexual exploits, Peter feels that he has missed out on enjoying the single lifestyle. Death is summoned to The Drunken Clam on a false alarm (thinking that Horace had died), and decides to grant Peter's wish by sending him, along with Brian, back to 1984 for one night. He notices his friend Cleveland, in his '80s look, who high-fives him around the pool. He then sees 18-year-old Lois Pewterschmidt walking around the country club pool, taking her high-heeled shoes off and jumping off the diving board into the pool with \\"Mr. Night\\" playing in the background, a reference to Caddyshack. Appearing to others as his 18-year-old self, Peter cancels his scheduled movie date to see Zapped! with Lois, instead accepting an invitation from Cleveland to go and party at a bar. Peter enjoys the evening, and ends up making out with actress Molly Ringwald before Death appears to return him to the present. Back in the present day, Peter discovers that his past actions have had drastic effects on the world: he and Molly have been married for 20 years; Judd Nelson crashes at their house once or twice a week; Lois is married to Quagmire; Al Gore is now the President of the United States; Chris, Meg, and Stewie have Quagmire's chin, nose, and mannerisms; and Chevy Chase is the host of The Tonight Show. Brian explains to Peter that by missing out on his date with Lois and making out with Molly, he altered the course of history. Brian also believes that they may have also caused a butterfly effect, as shown with the additional changes to their timeline. Despite Brian's objections about leaving his idea of a \\"perfect\\" world (in which there are flying cars that run on vegetable oil and Gore has killed Osama bin Laden by strangling him with his bare hands), Peter wants to go back to the past so he can undo his mistake. This seems to be a challenge because Death can only be summoned if someone dies, and Brian believes Al Gore's universal health care and zero-tolerance gun control laws have led to people living much longer. However, when Jane Jetson suddenly falls on the sidewalk and dies, Death arrives and again grants Peter's wish to return to the past. Back in the past, Peter is determined to accept Lois' invitation but repeatedly blows his opportunity and ends up repeatedly asking Death for a do-over. When Peter finally gets it right, he forgets a few hours later and parties with Cleveland instead of keeping the date. He asks Death for another chance but Death, fed up with Peter's continued blunders, tells him that he will have to fix the problem on his own. When Peter tries to apologize the next day, Lois is still upset with him for missing their date and has decided to go to the country club dance with Quagmire. Later that night, Peter and Brian sneak into the dance to prevent the kiss that caused Lois to fall in love with Quagmire. They get in by crawling through the air vent, but crash through and accidentally injure one of the guys playing in the band on the stage, so Brian has to play guitar and sing. Peter tries to convince Lois that they belong together but she stubbornly informs Peter that he had his chance and blew it, and therefore she loves Quagmire now. Peter almost gives up. Brian notices Chris, Stewie, and Meg disappearing from a group photo, indicating that they have fallen off the plane of existence. At a distance, but out of earshot, Brian urges Peter to do something that proofs to Lois that he loves her. Peter gets up his nerve, punching Quagmire and kissing Lois. He asks her to marry him and she accepts. In honor of this success, Brian and the band play \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\" by Rick Astley. The episode ends with things seemingly back to normal, with the exception of Roger from American Dad! apparently living with the family. Production \\"Meet the Quagmires\\" was the last episode to be directed by Dan Povenmire. The episode was written by series regular and future showrunner Mark Hentemann, and directed by Chris Robertson and series regular Dan Povenmire, who left the series after completing the episode, in order to create his own series for the Disney Channel entitled Phineas and Ferb, which has since been nominated for three Emmy Awards. Peter Shin, James Purdum and Chris Robertson acted as supervising director. Series creator Seth MacFarlane, David A. Goodman, Danny Smith, Mark Hentemann, Steve Callaghan and Chris Sheridan acted as executive producers. Alec Sulkin, Wellesley Wild, Alex Borstein and Mike Henry worked as supervising producers. Cherry Chevapravatdumrong and Patrick Meighan worked as executive story editors. The episode's original premise was based on Cleveland's divorce from his wife, Loretta, with Cleveland going on to become a hot bachelor in Quahog, causing Peter to become jealous, and desiring to become single again. Due to Warner Bros.'s ownership of Hanna–Barbera, the scene involving The Jetsons was completely reanimated by Povenmire, including the backgrounds and scenery for the sequence. Meet the Quagmires, along with four other episodes from the fifth season, and the first seven episodes of the sixth season, were released under the title \\"Volume 6\\" by 20th Century Fox in the United States and Canada on October 21, 2008, five months after they had completed broadcast on television. The DVD release also features bonus material including deleted scenes, commentaries, and a 'making of' featurette. In addition to the regular cast, the episode featured guest performances by voice actors Luke Adams and Jeff Bergman, actors Adam Carolla and Beth Littleford, and comedian and actor Will Sasso. Recurring guest voices include Alex Breckenridge, voice actors Johnny Brennan and Chris Cox, and writers Mark Hentemann, Alec Sulkin, and John Viener. Cultural references Rick Astley's single \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\" was performed by Seth MacFarlane as Brian Griffin. In the opening scene of the episode, Horace the bartender is suddenly knocked unconscious after falling off a ladder, causing Death to appear. After it is discovered that Horace is not actually dead, Death complains that he never likes to be too far from journalist Mike Wallace. Wallace was still alive as of the original airing date. The Back to the Future trilogy is parodied and referenced throughout the episode, along with many other movies and famous people throughout the 1980s. Other cultural references include how Peter becoming excited about his new prospects in life after going back in time and stating to Cleveland that he is going to \\"raise more hell than Hellraiser\\" from the 1987 horror film Hellraiser. It also depicts Pinhead as weak and ridiculous, stating that the worst he can do is unscrew a salt shaker and trick someone into using it, causing salt to come out all over their food. The first scene where Lois appears at the swimming pool is a reference to a scene from the 1980 film Caddyshack, featuring the song \\"Mr. Night\\" by Kenny Loggins. Once Lois appears, she asks Peter if he would like to see the 1982 film Zapped!. Rejecting her offer, Peter decides to go partying with Cleveland instead and play the video game Menstrual Ms. Pac-Man, in addition to making out with actress Molly Ringwald. While there, Brian gets into a fight, and instructs the bar patron to meet him on top of the World Trade Center to fight him at eight A.M. on September 11, 2001. While downstairs in the alternate universe, Peter makes a reference to the Twilight Zone episode, \\"The Eye of the Beholder.\\" The joke about the World Trade Center having been edited out of current airings of said episode. Returning to the present, Peter and Brian decide to watch television, and are shocked to discover that actor Chevy Chase is now the host of The Tonight Show. They also discover that former Vice President Al Gore is now President of the United States, and flying cars running on vegetable oil exist. A parody of the 1962 ABC animated series, Hanna-Barbera's The Jetsons, is then shown. In the alternate reality, Death refers to the Dick Cheney hunting accident, explaining that the \\"Chairman of Halliburton\\" accidentally shot and killed Karl Rove, Antonin Scalia, and Tucker Carlson (Brian groans that Peter and he shouldn't change his idea of a \\"wonderful\\" future, but Peter says \\"I don't know who any of those people are\\"). The main plot of the episode, complete with the scene in which Peter and Brian are in the living room, with Brian explaining to Peter what happened using a chalkboard, is a reference to the alternate universe scene in Back to the Future Part II. In the past once again, Peter suggests to Lois that they see the 1983 film Krull instead. Later, Peter and Cleveland, dressed up as Michael Jackson in the iconic red jacket of his video clip \\"Thriller,\\" dance to the Beverly Hills Cop theme. In order to make everything right about the future, Peter and Brian decide to sneak into the prom through a vent. While inside it, Peter recites a line from the 1988 action film Die Hard. The sequence that follows is a parody of the 1985 film Back to the Future. After crashing through the vent to the stage, the band begins playing \\"Earth Angel\\" by The Penguins, and, after Peter kisses Lois, Brian sings the 1987 single \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\" by musician Rick Astley. While Brian sings \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\", Rick Astley's cousin Marvin calls him to say he's found the \\"mediocre, generic sound\\" that Astley has been looking for, a reference to Back to the Future. In the closing scene of the episode Roger the alien from series creator Seth MacFarlane's second show American Dad! suddenly appears in the Griffin family home, inquiring about Pecan Sandies. Reception In a significant improvement over the previous week, the episode was viewed in 9.15 million homes in its original airing, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode also acquired a 3.2 rating in the 18–49 demographic, slightly being edged out by The Simpsons, while significantly winning over American Dad!, in both rating and total viewership. Reviews of the episode were mostly positive, noting its ability to \\"capture some of the appeal from the pre-cancellation days.\\" Ahsan Haque of IGN praised the episode's story, writing that it had \\"a great storyline and the right combination of irrelevant and relevant jokes\\", giving the episode an 8.4 out of 10. In another positive review, Brett Love of TV Squad called the episode \\"solid,\\" and praised the scenes set in 1984, and the alternate world. Love went on to state, \\"The show has lost a little of the luster that it once had, but that's no reason to count them out. There were enough bright spots to give hope for a return to that old form when season six comes around in the fall.\\" He graded \\"Meet the Quagmires\\" 5 out of 7. Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number fifteen on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of \\"yukyukyuks\\" and described it as \\"a brilliant parody of Back to the Future\\".

They are normally present in infancy, however, and until about one year of age, leading to the hypothesis that they are primitive or archaic reflexes. Frontal release signs are seen in disorders that affect the frontal lobes, such as dementias, metabolic encephalopathies, closed head injuries, and hydrocephalus. All of these disorders produce diffuse cerebral damage, usually involving many areas and systems in addition to the frontal lobes and pyramidal system, so the frontal release signs are not sufficient for a diagnosis.

It was produced by Stephen J. Cannell. Synopsis Palace Guard is the story of a reformed jewel thief and cat burglar, Tommy Logan (D. W. Moffett), who, after serving three years in prison, is released on parole and accepts an offer to become the head of security for the posh Palace Hotel chain. There are two reasons for this somewhat unusual job offer: Logan had previously enjoyed great success in stealing from the high-class clientele of the Palace chain, and so it was thought that he would understand how to prevent others from doing so; and Tommy was the illegitimate son of the chain's owner, Arturo Taft (Tony Lo Bianco), though Taft did not reveal this to Logan. The show centers primarily around the working relationship between Logan and his new boss, Christy Cooper (Marcy Walker), the hotel chain's Vice- President of Public Relations. In each episode, Logan and Cooper travel to a hotel in a different city where Logan helps avert some disaster using quirky and questionable methods, leaving Cooper to sweep up the fallout. Cast *D.

It originally aired on Fox in the United States on September 23, 2007. The episode is a retelling and parody of the 1977 blockbuster film, Star Wars, recasting the show's characters into Star Wars roles. The plot follows Peter as he retells the story of Star Wars while the electricity is out in their house. It was written by Alec Sulkin and directed by Dominic Polcino. To produce the installment the staff asked Lucasfilm, the company who owns the rights to the Star Wars franchise, for permission. Blue Harvest guest starred Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, Mick Hucknall, Rush Limbaugh, and Judd Nelson. The episode also included recurring voice actors Lori Alan, Adam West, Ralph Garman, Danny Smith, John Viener, Steve Callaghan, Kirker Butler, Mark Hentemann, Johnny Brennan, Jon Benjamin, Phil LaMarr, and Wally Wingert. It was viewed by 10.86 million viewers on its original broadcast and received generally positive reviews from critics. Plot While the Griffins are watching television, the power goes out and they are left with no other form of entertainment. While they wait for the power to return, Peter decides to retell the story of Star Wars beginning with \\"Part IV.\\" A Rebel ship is captured by a Star Destroyer. On the ship are the droids C-3PO (Quagmire), R2-D2 (Cleveland) and the rebel leader Princess Leia (Lois). While the ship is boarded by stormtroopers, Leia tries to send an MPEG to Obi-Wan Kenobi through R2, but encounters so many complications that R2 offers to deliver the message himself. Leia is captured by Darth Vader (Stewie) while R2 and 3PO flee to Tatooine in an escape pod, where they are captured by Jawas. The droids are sold to a family of moisture farmers, whose nephew Luke Skywalker (Chris) wishes to join the Rebellion and fight the Empire. While cleaning the droids, Luke stumbles upon Leia's message inside R2, who later decides to leave the farm. Luke and C-3PO pursue him, but are attacked by Sand People. Luke is knocked out by one of them (Opie) and is found by Obi-Wan Kenobi (Herbert), who takes them to his hut. Leia's message explains that R2 contains the plans to the Death Star, which must be sent to her father on her home planet of Alderaan and asks Obi-Wan to help. Obi-Wan tells Luke that he must learn the ways of the Force and accompany him to Alderaan, and gives him his own lightsaber. Realizing that the Empire must be looking for the droids, Luke returns home to discover that his home has been destroyed and his aunt and uncle killed, along with John Williams. Luke, Obi-Wan, and the droids travel to Mos Eisley to find a pilot to take them to Alderaan. At a local cantina, they hire smuggler Han Solo (Peter) and his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca (Brian), who agree to take them with their ship, the Millennium Falcon. The group is soon spotted by stormtroopers and they flee into space, evading the pursuing Star Destroyers before jumping into hyperspace. Leia is imprisoned on the Death Star, where commanding officer Grand Moff Tarkin (Adam West) has Alderaan destroyed. The Millennium Falcon exits hyperspace and is captured by the Death Star's tractor beam and brought into its hangar bay. Disguising themselves as stormtroopers, Han and Luke along with Chewbacca set off to rescue the captive Princess while Obi-Wan goes to shut off the tractor beam and R2 and C3PO stay behind. Han, Luke and Chewie rescue Leia, and the four dive into a garbage chute to escape stormtroopers and find a couch in the garbage masher below. As they flee the Death Star, Obi-Wan turns off the tractor beam before being confronted by Darth Vader in a lightsaber duel. Vader strikes Obi-Wan down as the others board the Falcon, taking the couch with them. The Falcon journeys to the Rebel base at Yavin IV, where the Rebels analyze the Death Star plans and find a weakness. Luke joins the assault team while Han collects his reward for the rescue and prepares to leave. The Rebel fighters (who also include Simply Red, Helen Reddy, Redd Foxx, Red Buttons, the Red October and an anthropomorphic pack of Big Red gum) attack the Death Star but suffer heavy losses during the assault. During his run, Luke hears Obi-Wan's voice telling him to use the Force, and he turns off his targeting computer. Vader appears with his own group of fighters, and is about to fire at Luke's starfighter when Han arrives in the Falcon and attacks Vader and his men, sending Vader's ship off into space. Guided by the Force, Luke fires into the port, destroying the Death Star, and he returns to the Rebel base with his friends to celebrate their victory. Back at the Griffins' home, Peter wraps up the story as the power comes back on. Everyone thanks Peter for keeping them entertained, although Chris points out that Robot Chicken already told that story. Peter dismisses and mocks the show, and Chris storms off. Production Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane served as executive producer for the episode. \\"Blue Harvest\\" originally aired on September 23, 2007, as the premiere for the sixth season of Family Guy. The episode was written by Alec Sulkin, who has been with the show since the fourth season. It was directed by series veteran Dominic Polcino, who has been directing for the series since its first season. Series regulars Peter Shin and James Purdum served as supervising directors. The episode's music was composed by Walter Murphy. Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane explained that the reason they made a parody of Star Wars in particular was because the show's staff members were huge fans of the films. They also chose Star Wars because Lucasfilm allowed it. MacFarlane stated that creating parodies based on Raiders of the Lost Ark or Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan was originally considered, but they assumed they would be unable to gain permission from the owners of those properties (in this case Paramount Pictures). Lucasfilm only gave the show's staff one condition, which was that the characters had to look exactly like they do in the movies. Clips of the episode were shown to audience members at Star Wars Celebration IV, where a panel was hosted by MacFarlane, Sulkin and Polcino, and executive producer David A. Goodman. The episode was also previewed at the 2007 Comic-Con International. In addition to the regular cast, actors Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, and Judd Nelson, musician Mick Hucknall, singer Helen Reddy, and political commentator Rush Limbaugh made guest appearances. Recurring guest voice actors Phil LaMarr, Johnny Brennan, Jon Benjamin, Lori Alan, Adam West, Ralph Garman, writer Danny Smith, writer John Viener, executive producer Steve Callaghan, Kirker Butler, executive producer Mark Hentemann writer Wally Wingert and Alec Sulkin also made minor appearances in the episode. Cultural references The episode was a retelling of George Lucas' Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. \\"Blue Harvest\\" contains many references to popular culture, particularly to the Star Wars film series. Most of the episode itself is a retelling of George Lucas' film Star Wars. The episode's name is a reference to the fake working title for the production of Return of the Jedi. When Peter is about to begin telling the story he says that it is about \\"love and loss, fathers and sons, and the foresight to retain international merchandising rights\\", a reference to the fact that 20th Century Fox gave those rights to Lucasfilm. During the text scrawl actress Angelina Jolie, her film Gia, and the television channel HBO are mentioned. One of the Star Destroyers displays a bumper sticker reading \\"Bush – Cheney\\" a reference to United States President George W. Bush and Dick Cheney's 2004 re-election campaign. When the Millennium Falcon enters hyperspace, the visual effect is replaced with the intro sequence from Doctor Who, using the version of that sequence from the Tom Baker era; and when the Millennium Falcon leaves hyperspace, it gets to the Asteroids. Once Leia is captured, Vader asks her where she hid the Death Star plans, leading her to respond that they are in one of twenty-six briefcases, a reference to the game show Deal or No Deal. When Luke is watching the sunset, he breaks the fourth wall by introducing Star Wars composer John Williams and the London Symphony Orchestra, who have been scoring the scene, in a parody of a scene from Blazing Saddles featuring Count Basie and his orchestra. Luke then asks the orchestra to play the theme of The People's Court. Later in the episode when Luke finds his uncle and aunt murdered, he also finds that Williams and the entire orchestra have been killed as well; this saddens Luke, since the episode will now have to be scored by composer Danny Elfman before Luke decapitates him with his lightsaber. While searching for R2-D2, Luke listens to conservative political commentator Rush Limbaugh's radio show , in which Limbaugh says that the \\"liberal galactic media is saying that the planet Hoth is melting\\". One of the band members that plays at the cantina asks for any song request and then he subtly responds to his own question by saying \\"play that same song,\\" a reference to the fact that the song being played in the film scene lasts a long time. Obi-Wan sings a rendition of \\"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\\" from the film Dirty Dancing, in case he never sees Luke again. In a fight with a group of TIE fighters, Luke asks the origins behind their name; the following scene then shows that the pilots are from Thailand. Leslie Nielsen's character from the movie Airplane! wishes Han good luck during their encounter with the TIE fighters. When seeking how to destroy the Death Star, the rebels look at an instructional video hosted by basketball player Magic Johnson. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo's characters from the National Lampoon's Vacation films appear driving by the Death Star. Chris, who is voiced by Seth Green, points out that Robot Chicken already did a Star Wars parody (Green is the creator of Robot Chicken). Reception In its original broadcast on September 23, 2007, \\"Blue Harvest\\" was viewed by 10.86 million viewers. The episode acquired a 5.5 Nielsen rating, the audience measurement systems developed to determine the audience size and composition of television programming in the United States, in the 18–49 demographic. Reviews of this episode were generally positive. Common Sense Media gave the episode three out of five stars, calling it a \\"racy but often hilarious satire of fantasy favorite\\". Brad Trechak of TV Squad also praised \\"Blue Harvest\\", stating that it \\"was a fun episode to watch\\"; he thought that \\"MacFarlane kept to the story pretty well, and there were enough corny jokes to make it amusing\\". Ahsan Haque from IGN gave it a score of seven out of ten, criticizing the selection of Herbert as Obi-Wan, but did say that the other choices were \\"spot-on\\"; he ended his review by stating, \\"as a tribute to Star Wars, this episode succeeds, but you can't help but wish that there was a bit more to it, considering the nature of the source material\\". In a later review of the season as a whole, Haque said that the episode was \\"generally entertaining, but certainly wasn't as great as it could have been\\". In 2019, however, Jesse Schedeen, also from IGN, placed \\"Blue Harvest\\" as the second best episode in his list of the 20 best Family Guy episodes, to celebrate the show's 20th anniversary, stating that it \\"was Family Guy's first attempt at devoting an hour-length episode to lampooning the Star Wars franchise, and it remains the best.\\" Daniel Fienberg of Zap2it also gave it a positive review although he stated that it was released soon after Robot Chicken's Star Wars special and it fared worse because of it. Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number three on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of \\"yukyukyuks\\" and described the episode as \\"pretty much the same [as its sequel] but better.\\" Newsday's Diane Werts rendered a more mixed verdict, saying the episode \\"veer[s] wildly from bull's-eye satire to gotta-fill-time-now exposition\\", and was not as enjoyable for non-Star Wars fans. Robin Pierson of The TV Critic also gave it a mixed review, criticizing the writers for using the character of Herbert and the episode's musical moment which he called an \\"un-amusing waste of time\\", although he did praise the way that the episode satirized the Star Wars universe; he ended his review by saying that \\"Chances are the more you like Star Wars, the more you will enjoy this. For those of us who know Family Guy better than Star Wars, there is plenty of bad material here to remind us that nothing much has changed\\". He gave the episode sixty-five out of a possible one-hundred. The Parents Television Council, a group that has been a frequent critic of Family Guy, criticized the episode for a perceived frequent use of sexual dialogue, enough for the episode to have an \\"S\\" content descriptor for sexual content (the episode was rated TV-14-DLV on Fox). In 2009, TV Guide ranked \\"Blue Harvest\\" #99 on its list of the 100 Greatest Episodes. Home media The episode was released on January 15, 2008 for DVD and on August 7, 2012 for Blu-ray in Region 1. It was issued on January 21, 2008 for DVD in Region 2, and on February 6, 2008 DVD and on August 24, 2011 for Blu-ray in Region 4. \\"Blue Harvest\\" was also released as part of the Laugh It Up, Fuzzball: The Family Guy Trilogy which was released on December 21, 2010 for DVD and on December 21, 2010 for Blu-ray in Region 1.

The earliest documented Ickwell May Day festivities were in 1565. By then it had become a Christian festival, though its origins likely pre-date Christianity to the pagan Beltane festivals. In 1872 the squire of the town erected a permanent Maypole and left a bequest in his will to fund the annual celebration. Like many English festivals, the Ickwell May Day is usually accompanied by Morris dancing -- in this case, the Ickwell Mayers, with their Lord and Lady, and the dirty-faced Moggies. Many other customs associated with the day have been recorded over the years. One, unique to Ickwell, is that of the Old Scholars, a group of alumni of the village school. The Old Scholars dance around the maypole, some with two or even three generations of their offspring. In 1945, the Ickwell and District May Day Committee was formed. The Committee organizes the games, refreshments, contests, dances, music and other activities, including the crowning of the May Queen. Due to its documented age and long history, the Ickwell May Day has become something of an attraction, and is listed on the East of England Tourist Board's publicity sheet for \\"May Day Bank Holiday in the East of England.\\" References * Ickwell May Day home page * May Day Bank Holiday in the East of England (pdf format) Holidays in England Festivals in Bedfordshire Spring (season) events in England ","title":"Ickwell May Day"},{"id":"6468391","text":"Transverse metacarpal ligament can refer to: * Deep transverse metacarpal ligament * Superficial transverse metacarpal ligament ","title":"Transverse metacarpal ligament"},{"id":"6468394","text":"Top Gear 3000, later released in Japan as , is a racing video game developed by Gremlin Interactive and published by Kemco for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the third game in the original Top Gear trilogy, and the last in the series to be developed by Gremlin. 3000 heavily resembles the previous Top Gear 2, but is set in the distant future. Comparison to series Placing this game a thousand years in the future allowed the developers to plausibly include futuristic and improbable technologies, and abandon the relative realism of Top Gear 2. Car upgrades were more extensive than in Top Gear 2, and \\"weapons\\" were featured for the first time in the series. Upgrades included a nuclear fusion engine, a cobalt-titanium armor kit, and a liquid polymer gearbox; weapons included a device to jump over cars, a warp device, and a magnetic attractor to steal kinetic energy from other cars. Due to the capabilities of the new chip DSP-4 used for this game, it was the first game in the series that was possible to split the track in two different directions with different lengths, sometimes intentionally making one route much faster than the other. Top Gear 3000 was the only game in the history of the Super NES to use this chip. Story The introduction states that anonymous benefactors and funders have created a massive galaxy- wide racing campaign at the outset of each millennium,Intro: Once every millennium, one of the greatest events in the galaxy begins... It is a race. A car race. It starts at the furthest reaches of the galaxy and ends at the center. For the winner riches beyond belief. Knowledge of the race is passed from generation to generation. The identity of the organizer has been lost through the mists of the time. Or maybe it has never been known. But even the youngest child knows on a certain date... all he has to do is look to the skies... for a sign. The time has arrived. YOU are in the race. GOOD LUCK and reward the winner with \\"riches beyond belief\\". The instruction manual gives a more detailed dystopian story. The year is 2962 (and not 3000 as shown in the title of the video game). Five centuries before, World War XVII devastated most of the colonized planets of the Milky Way. The Galactic Conglomerate of Unified Planets, controlling the Bureau of Reasonable Entertainment, has maintained an era of calm and peaceful co-existence through the systematic suppression of any radical thought or action that may \\"stir up\\" the teeming masses of citizens populating the twelve star systems under their jurisdiction. Anything remotely resembling \\"fun\\" has been analyzed and sterilized.GameFAQs - Instruction Manual Information Outlaw thrill seekers that have too much money and not enough excitement in their lives to keep them occupied turn to The Top Gear 3000 Challenge. Once every millennium, the richest, bravest, most skilled drivers risk it all in this car race through the planets of the Conglomerate. Gameplay First track The game has two distinct modes of gameplay, with Championship being the most expansive. Cars are limited by the range of their fuel, and of the condition of their frame; players gain fuel by driving over the red Recharge strips, and repair their car's structural integrity by driving over the blue Repair strips. Championship In Championship mode, one or two players can play, or one player can play with the screen split between his/her view and that of an AI opponent. Players start off with identical cars and may change the color, name, speed units (MPH or km/h), and the button layout. Unlike in previous Top Gear games with a few pre-generated layouts, the players may adjust any function to any button desired. Each race contains a pack of twenty cars, with eighteen or nineteen named AI opponents. After races are won, players then spend earned credits replacing the engine, gearbox, tires, armor, boost, and adding \\"weapons\\" capability. The AI opponents do not purchase upgrades, but grow steadily faster throughout the championship. Bonuses of various quantities may be placed on the track as spherical icons, or awarded for certain driver activities after the end of each race as secret bonuses. These bonuses are: *Secret Bonus A: Finishing the race with an active boost (30000 credits) *Secret Bonus B: Secret (50000 credits) (Some have speculated that this bonus is given if you finish first with the seconds counter on the clock being ether 11, 22, 33, 44, or 55.) *Secret Bonus C: No collisions with another car during the race (70000 credits) *Secret Bonus D: No collisions with obstacles on or off the track (40000 credits) *Secret Bonus E: No driving off-road (20000 credits) Total: 210000 credits Some races intentionally have less than minimum recharge strips, forcing the player to run out of gas. As the cars are futuristic, the cars can sustain a great speed even without gas, making it possible to win races without recharging. But if the player hits a tree or another object that makes the car lose too much speed, the car then will run at a very low speed, almost not moving. The only way to make the car gain speed again is by running over a red strip, using the attractor on another car, being hit by a fast car or using a boost of level 4 or higher. As well, nuclear engines can keep the velocity even when the player doesn't have gas. Upgrades Not all upgrades are available from the beginning of the championship. As the player progresses through the championship, new engines, gearboxes, tires, armor, boost and weapons become available. The game has three difficulty settings, each making the championship longer, and the AI cars faster. In the easy and medium difficulty settings, not all the level 6 components become available, preventing the player from purchasing all available upgrades. The weapons do not influence the other racers at all. You can jump over other cars, warp through other cars and even attract your car towards another, but these weapons only affect your car. The player can cycle between the weapons using the L or R trigger buttons. *Jump **Jump is the only weapon controlled by the player that has no limit of uses. It is used to get bonuses, jump over other cars or even obstacles. It is very useful at the beginning of the race, when the player is far behind and has lots of cars to pass. *Warp **The warp weapon makes the car disappear for about 1.5 seconds, travel through the track (doing any turns correctly along the way) and then reappear. The car travels this distance almost instantly, so it can be used to pass cars ahead to avoid a crash. While invisible, the car is immune to any obstacle or car, but can still collect any bonuses along the way. The warp weapon is limited to four uses. *Attractor **The attractor weapon places a target on screen, and when there is another car in sight, the target follows the car on screen. If the player begins to use the attractor weapon, his vehicle gains the speed of the targeted vehicle. The other car however, does not lose any momentum. The attractor weapon is limited to a gauge similar to that of the fuel gauge. The attractor can be used constantly for about 10 seconds, but the player may decide on how frequently they use it. *Infrared **The infrared weapon is the only weapon not controlled by the player. The infrared is turned on in every nighttime race and off in every daytime race. When turned on, the screen is covered with a tone of red and it is much easier to see and avoid obstacles and cars. *Boost **The boost weapon is the only weapon that the player begins the game with, and the only weapon that is upgradeable. The boost weapon increases the car's speed for a limited time. Upgrading the boost weapon means the boost will be stronger and last longer. Beginning from boost level 4, it is possible to make the car gain speed again from the almost stopped state without fuel. The boost weapon is limited to four uses, but some bonuses in the race gives extra boost uses to the player. Versus Title screen of Top Gear 3000. In Versus Mode, up to four players can play with the addition of a multitap. The screen is always split four ways; if there are fewer than four players, AI opponents will form up the remainder. Each race is a stand-alone affair on a single track, with players choosing from four different speed/acceleration/boost combinations (similar to original Top Gear) before the race begins. Passwords Top Gear 3000 employs a password system which allows the player to resume gameplay after switching the console off. It restores all purchased upgrades and championship status. The password system can also be used for cheats, a common one which uses a B for the first three slots (BBB) to give the player millions of credits which then allows for all upgrades to be eventually purchased as they are developed. The game defaults to medium difficulty, which means that not all upgrades are ever developed. It begins at the second race. Other password cheats do exist. Reception On release, Famicom Tsūshin scored the game a 21 out of 40.NEW GAMES CROSS REVIEW: プラネットチャンプ -TG3000-. Weekly Famicom Tsūshin. No.333. Pg.29. 5 May 1995. GamePro commented that the game is solidly made, but derivative. They elaborated that the weapons are not truly important to the action and that many of the outer space locales \\"look suspiciously Earthlike\\", leaving the \\"terrific\\" four-player mode as the only element to set Top Gear 3000 apart from the many racers which preceded it.

Players need to finish in the top ten positions in each race to qualify for the next one. There is a map that shows the course layout, the position of the players, and the position of the car in first place. The player is given 6 \\"nitro boosts\\" at the start which dramatically increase the car's speed for a short period of time. On certain courses, there are pickups along the road ranging from a \\"$\\" which is $1,000 cash, a \\"N\\" which is an extra \\"nitro boost\\", and a \\"S\\" which is an automatic nitro administered right when picked up and returns each lap. The other pickups can only be collected once per race. Players must take care to avoid too much damage to any area of the armor. If a section of armor is destroyed and the player takes damage in the area that the destroyed section of the armor used to protect, the car will spin out. Racers will be disqualified if they run out of fuel and coast to a stop before finishing the race. Since there are no pits for cars to refuel in unlike the first game, upgrading the gearbox becomes mandatory in order to get the fuel economy needed to survive the longer races in the later portions of the game. Since the Genesis port of this game does not implement a fuel gauge, fuel economy is not a problem in that port. Players have the option of either an automatic or manual gearshift, and can configure the controls as they please at the opening menu of the game. Players can spend money earned in a race to upgrade their cars. Upgrading the engine makes the car accelerate faster, helps the top speed of the car by a small amount, and makes it easier for the car to reach higher gears. Upgrading the nitro makes nitro boosts accelerate more strongly and reach higher top speeds. Upgrading the gearbox mainly improves the car's top speed, improves the car's fuel economy, and can greatly improve the car's acceleration starting with the third out of four gearboxes that are available, but gearbox upgrades require an engine that is strong enough to allow shifting into higher gears in order to be effective. Upgrading the armor allows cars to take more damage before the armor is destroyed in the area that is being upgraded. The paint shop allows the color of the car to be changed. Upgrading the tires improves their grip and the car's turning performance. Reception Reviewing the Genesis version, GamePro assessed that Top Gear 2 has a good number of tracks and solid controls, but feels outdated compared to contemporary racing games due to the limited options for altering the car's configuration. They concluded that “for simple, straightforward fun, Top Gear 2 still qualifies. Nintendo Power gave the SNES version a score of 3.55 out of 5.

It was originally designated the TPS-43E2. Although the antenna is a radically new design from the TPS-43, the radar van itself, which houses the transmitter, receiver processors, and displays is very similar to the older TPS-43E2. It is produced in the United States originally by Westinghouse Defense and Electronic Division, which was later purchased by Northrop-Grumman.  Description  The AN/TPS-75 radar antenna packed on a 5-ton truck. The AN/TPS-75 is the primary transportable Aerospace Control And Warning (AC&W;) radar used by the United States Air Force.The US Military description for radar type TPS is \\"Ground, Transportable; Radar; Detecting, Range and Bearing, Search\\".Mobile Military Radar website, Radar Types page (accessed 2015-01-06) The TPS-75 is capable of transmitting 5-Megawatts of power. (Although 5-Megawatts is almost never achieved; realistically it is approx 2.8 Megawatts) This radar was developed as an upgrade of the AN/TPS-43(V), which entered US service in 1970; it incorporates new electronics and a new Ultra Low Side Lobe Antenna (ULSA). About 67 TPS-43(V) radars were upgraded to TPS-75(V) standard starting in FY88.Mobile Military Radar website, Radar Descriptions page (accessed 2015-01-06) The entire system can be broken down and packed onto two M939 trucks for road transport and mobile air transport by planes such as the C-130 Hercules or bigger. The entire radar system can be \\"torn down\\" and be ready for transport in just a few hours. This varies greatly with the number of personnel, their level of training, and method of transport. A typical convoy package would consist of one 5-ton truck pulling the radar van with the radar antenna in the bed of the truck and a support 5-ton pulling an AN/MJQ-1632 400 Hz power plant. The support truck would hold some spare parts, fuel tank(s), camouflage netting, and other logistical items as needed. The heat exchanger and -18 environmental control unit (ECU) are normally loaded into and transported within the radar van. There are many add-ons for the TPS-75, one of which allows the AN/TPS-75 to be tilted back to see into the atmosphere assisting in detection of long range ballistic missiles.

H. Margetson's illustration for Maud Isabel Ebbutt's Hero-Myths and Legends of the British Race (1910) The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle (The Weddynge of Syr Gawen and Dame Ragnell) is a 15th-century English poem, one of several versions of the \\"loathly lady\\" story popular during the Middle Ages. An earlier version of the story appears as \\"The Wyfe of Bayths Tale\\" (\\"The Wife of Bath's Tale\\") in Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales,The Canterbury Tales, pp. 258–292. and the later ballad \\"The Marriage of Sir Gawain\\" is essentially a retelling, though its relationship to the medieval poem is uncertain.Price, p. 310. The author's name is not known, but similarities to Le Morte d'Arthur have led to the suggestion that the poem may have been written by Sir Thomas Malory. Text Stories about the Arthurian court were popular in medieval England, and the worn condition of some of the manuscripts suggests that they were well read. The Ragnelle narrative may have been intended for a festive or less than serious audience. Thomas Garbaty sees the poem as a humorous parody of the Arthurian legend, where Arthur is cowed by both the challenging knight and Ragnelle, \\"passing the buck\\" to Gawain.Garbaty, p. 418. The Wedding of Sir Gawain survives in a poorly copied 16th-century manuscript located in the Bodleian Library (Bodleian 11951, formerly Rawlinson C.86) though it was probably written in the 15th century.Hahn, p. 44.Price, pp. 506–507. Plot summary The story begins when the mystical knight Sir Gromer Somer Joure challenges King Arthur to discover what women desire the most, or face dire consequences. This encounter takes place following the stalking of a deer by the king in Inglewood Forest, a setting that in other Middle English Arthurian poems such as The Awntyrs off Arthure and Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle, is a haunted forest and a place where the Otherworld is near at hand.Hahn, Thomas, 1995. Sir Gawain: Eleven Romances and Tales. The king, on his own instructions, becomes separated from the rest of his hunting party, follows the deer, kills it and is then surprised by the arrival of an armed knight, Sir Gromer Somer Joure, whose lands, this knight claims, have been seized from him by Sir Gawain. King Arthur is alone and unarmed and Sir Gromer's arrival poses a real threat to him. Sir Gromer tells the king that he must return in exactly one year's time, alone and dressed as he is now, and give him the answer to a question he will ask. If the king fails to give a satisfactory answer, Sir Gromer will cut off his head. The question is this: what is it that women most desire? King Arthur returns to Carlisle with his knights and it is not long before Sir Gawain pries from his uncle the reason for his sudden melancholy. King Arthur explains to his nephew what happened to him in the forest and Sir Gawain, optimistically upbeat, suggests that they both ride about the country collecting answers to this tricky question. So they both do this, riding separately about the kingdom and writing down the answers they receive. When they return, they compare notes. Sir Gawain is still willing, but King Arthur senses the hopelessness of it all and decides to go once more into Inglewood Forest to look for inspiration. In the forest he encounters an ugly hag on a fine horse, a loathly lady who claims to know the king's problem and offers to give him the answer to this question that will save his life, on one condition. That she is allowed to marry Sir Gawain. The king returns to Carlisle and reluctantly confronts Sir Gawain with this dilemma; for he is sure that his nephew will be willing to sacrifice himself in order to save him. Gawain selflessly consents in order to save his uncle. Soon, King Arthur rides alone into the forest to fulfill his promise to Sir Gromer Somer Joure and quickly meets with Dame Ragnelle, who is, in fact, Sir Gromer's sister and who reminds King Arthur of the hopelessness of his task: :\\"The kyng had rydden butt a while, :Lytelle more then the space of a myle, :Or he mett Dame Ragnelle. :\\"Ah, Sir Kyng! Ye arre nowe welcum here. :I wott ye ryde to bere your answere; :That wolle avaylle you no dele.\\"TEAMS edition of The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle, edited by Thomas Hahn, lines 390 – 395. King Arthur tells her that Sir Gawain accepts her terms and she reveals to him that what women desire most is sovereynté, the ability to make their own decisions. With this answer King Arthur wins Gromer's challenge, and much to his despair, the wedding of Gawain and Ragnelle goes ahead as planned. Later, the newlyweds retire to their bedroom. After brief hesitation, Gawain assents to treat his new bride as he would if she were desirable, and go to bed with her as a dutiful husband is expected to do. However, when he looks up, he is astonished to see not an ugly hag, but the most beautiful woman he has ever seen standing before him. Ragnelle explains she had been under a spell to look like a hag until a good knight married her; now her looks will be restored, but only half the day. She gives him a choice-would he rather have her beautiful at night, when they are together, or during the day, when they are with others? Instead, he puts the riddle's answer to good practical use by giving her the sovereynté to make the choice herself. This answer lifts the curse for good, and Ragnelle's beauty returns permanently. The couple live happily, and the court is overjoyed when they hear Ragnelle's story. Sadly, Ragnelle lives for only five more years, after which Gawain mourns her for the rest of his life. According to the poem, Ragnelle bore Gawain his son Gingalain, who is the hero of his own romance and whose arrival at King Arthur's court and subsequent adventures are related, possibly by Thomas Chestre, in the Middle English version of the story of The Fair Unknown, or Lybeaus Desconus Mills, M., 1969. (although in this and most other versions of the story, Gingalain's mother is a fay who raises him ignorant of his father).Busby, pp. 380–381. The poem concludes with the poet's plea that God will help him get out of jail, leading P.J.C. Field to suggest that the poem may have been written by Sir Thomas Malory.Lupack, Alan, 2005. p 314. Analysis \\"The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle\\" was most likely written after Geoffrey Chaucer's \\"The Wife of Bath's Tale\\", one of The Canterbury Tales. The differences between the two almost identical plots lead scholars to believe that the poem is a parody of the romantic medieval tradition. The physical characteristics of Dame Ragnelle are exaggerated in comparison to the earlier text. Other characters, such as Sir Gawain and King Arthur, are portrayed as very stylized stereotypes of themselves.Davis, pp. 430-439.Folks 1989. There are many references to aristocratic practices which seem to indicate the author's overall distaste for them. For example, Dame Ragnelle behaves appallingly at the Wedding feast, offending the onlookers; however, because she is now married to a knight, she must be considered better than the population regardless of her atrocious manners. Also, when King Arthur is presented with the challenge by Sir Gromer, it is expected that a knight should take on the mission for him. In other Arthurian stories, the challenge often involves danger or threat to the king, but this instance seems like a silly task to delegate, although the king's life is still at stake if the correct answer is not found. The other most prominent ritual is the spoken oath. The author lends a more approving tone to the notion of using a spoken word as a trustworthy contract. Throughout the story, everyone remains good to their word, and nothing bad comes of it. Perhaps the author used this as a contrast to indicate that, while most social practices were ridiculous, it was appropriate to keep the useful ones.Donnelly, pp. 321-343. Another major theme in the poem is the perversion of stereotypical gender roles. Because Dame Ragnelle is a hag with no manners, she falls out of the expected female role. While Gromer is attempting to regain control of the land that he claims should be his, Dame Ragnelle simply circumvents the system. She manipulates Gawain with information in order to marry into a more desired class with a title, at which point she no longer needs to regain her family's land which would have gone straight to the male heir, Gromer, regardless. Ragnelle's power over others and in society generally increase through the poem; some scholars suggest she becomes more masculine in behavior and status as a result. In this reading her production of a male heir symbolizes the final stage or her gender perversion.Forste- Grupp, pp. 105-122.

It was the thirteenth book published in the Dragonriders of Pern series by Anne or her son Todd McCaffrey .. Retrieved 2011-10-09. The Dolphins of Pern was first published in 1994. The cover painting by Rowena Morrill was used again for the biography Anne McCaffrey: a life with dragons . Plot summary This novel follows Dragonsdawn and the short story The Dolphin's Bell (short story contained in The Chronicles of Pern: First Fall) by discussing the present state (Ninth Pass) of the dolphins that were brought to Pern by the colonists. Set near the end and after the events of All the Weyrs of Pern it further integrates the science fiction aspects of the origins of the Pern series with the fantastical aspects presented by the original books. The plot focuses primarily on two young characters and chronicles the birth of the Dolphincrafthall and its first Dolphineer. Readis, the Paradise River Lord Holder's son, is saved by talking dolphins (\\"shipfish\\") as a young boy after falling into the sea and subsequently develops a strong fascination with the dolphins. T'lion, the young Eastern Weyr dragonrider of Bronze Gadareth, also develops an interest after being involved in an early dolphin encounter. The two befriend each other due to their shared interest and, in their own ways, defy family, Hold and Weyr to maintain their friendships with dolphins and convince others of the dolphins' intelligence and ability to speak. While familiar characters struggle to end the era of Thread, Readis, T'lion and others struggle to begin a new era in which dolphin and human work together again. Well-known characters from previous Pern novels are also involved in the plot, including Benden Weyrleaders Lessa and F'lar, and Masterharpers Robinton and Menolly.

The Salisbury Mall's regional mall competition was the Blue Hen Mall (now the Blue Hen Corporate Center) in Dover, Delaware (60 miles away), which opened in 1969, and the Dover Mall, which opened in 1982. Salisbury Mall's location on Civic and Glen Avenues was situated between a residential neighborhood and businesses along U.S. Route 50. The Wicomico Youth and Civic Center was within of the mall, and a city park and zoo were within walking distance. A strip mall called The Twilley Centre, which included a Toys \\"R\\" Us, was soon built directly behind the mall's west wing to take advantage of the traffic from the mall. Service Merchandise also built a store within two blocks of the mall. The Salisbury Mall enjoyed a strong tourist customer base given its location on the major roadways of the Eastern Shore of Maryland and its close proximity to the popular tourist resort, Ocean City. History 1960s Construction began in October 1967 on of land. The official grand opening took place on October 16, 1968. At the time of the grand opening only sixteen of the forty stores were open for business, but by the holiday shopping season all of the stores were ready. The front page of the Daily Times read, \\"Miss America will be on hand for opening of $7,000,000 mall here.\\" The article states, \\"Opening ceremonies and speeches are expected to be brief, according to Will Hall, mall manager ... Before the day is over, hundreds—and perhaps thousands—of shoppers or sight-seers are expected to stroll the interior mall with its illuminated fountains and planters and new shops.\\" The Daily Times speculated that when fully functional, the Salisbury Mall would employ at least 1,000 workers with a payroll around $6 million per month. The Salisbury Mall was originally anchored by Sears, and Hecht's (then known as The Hecht Co). The mall's west wing spanned 1/10 of a mile. Renovation and expansion The mall underwent a major renovation and expansion in 1976. An east wing was added, which opened on September 12, 1976. The mall's west section had a classic look with pillared entrances, whereas the east section was more modern. The entire building was made of white brick and stone. The mall's interior flooring space was re-done with a simulated wood parque during the renovation, replacing the original white ceramic tiles. The parking lot was expanded to accommodate parking for up to 5,000 vehicles. This expansion nearly doubled the mall's size, which added two additional anchors: Shoppers Food Warehouse (Originally Pantry Pride) and regional department store Hutzler's. (later Peebles). Also added were a two-screen movie theater, a Friendly's restaurant, and space for 30 additional stores. This brought the total number of shops and restaurants to 70 and made the mall in the shape of an H. The Salisbury Mall continued to flourish well into the 1980s, though the owners did little to renovate the interior structure, with the exception of the Tier 1 and 2 level stores, which received some minor renovations to keep up with the rapidly changing styles of the 1980s. On April 30, 1987, Hutzler's closed its doors after being purchased by another regional department store: Peebles. The anchor site was completely renovated and re-opened on August 1, 1987. This would be the last major addition to the mall. On May 31, 1989, Shoppers Food Warehouse closed its Salisbury location, and in its place a similar grocery store called Food Depot opened on September 1, 1989, after some minor renovations. Decline On July 27, 1990, The Centre at Salisbury, a regional mall located just three miles (5 km) north of the Salisbury Mall, opened, which signaled the beginning of the end for the aging mall. The demise of the Salisbury Mall came about when it became obvious that a US 50 extension of the Salisbury Bypass was necessary to relieve the annual downtown congestion. The Centre at Salisbury attracted slightly more upscale establishments lacking at the Salisbury Mall, including amenities that were standard at most regional shopping malls such as a food court and a modern 10 screen multi-plex theater (later 16 screens). Previously, locals would have to travel to the Baltimore/Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, to outlet centers in nearby Delaware, or to elsewhere on the Eastern Shore for these amenities. Hecht's and Sears relocated to the new mall in November 1991 as their leases expired, leaving Peebles and Food Depot as the only remaining anchors. In 1992, some of the remaining merchants undertook minor renovations to give their stores a more modern look, but the mall owners did no renovations on the mall itself, which retained from the 1970s its use of earth tones, low ceilings, and unremarkable architecture. The original Salisbury Mall marquee sign from 1968 still stood in the parking lot, slowly rusting by this point. This contrasted with other malls in the region, including the newly built Centre at Salisbury, with its heavy use of skylights, high ceilings, marble flooring, large atria, and use of pastel colors popular in mall design in the 1990s. In March 1992, the two-screen movie theater closed for business. Foot traffic decreased due to the loss of two of the four anchor stores and more than two-thirds of the Tier 1 and 2 level stores, and due to rising crime rates in the surrounding area. Both of the mall's sit-down restaurants, Friendly's and Tony's Pizza, closed in May 1992. This was the final blow to the aging mall. Most of the remaining tenants would follow suit throughout the remainder of the decade as their leases expired, with the exception of the smallest shops.  Homicide  On September 9, 1991, a seventeen-year-old Salisbury State University freshman student from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was murdered when she separated from a group of friends to use the restroom. When she exited the stall inside the ladies room she was confronted by David Boyd. He immediately stabbed her once in her chest and then spun her around and stabbed her once more in the back. Boyd then ran out of the restroom while Miller cried in pain. He then rode his bike to a nearby park where he fell asleep. He was arrested and convicted of murder, and sentenced to life in prison. Boyd continues to serve his sentence at the Maryland Correctional Institution - Hagerstown, located exactly halfway in between Miller's hometown of Pittsburgh and Salisbury, Maryland. West wing closure The mall changed owners in 1997, purchased by Salisbury Mall Associates, LLC of Baltimore, Maryland. The new owners closed the original west wing of the mall in the spring of 1998 by erecting a plywood divider to block it off from the eastern wing. The western wing was allowed to quickly deteriorate. Because of the mall's flat roof, leaks were often a problem, and the original west wing was now going without the most basic of upkeep and maintenance. There had been several unsuccessful attempts to attract the required national anchor chains to breathe life back into the deteriorating structure. Peebles, Food Depot, and a few antique kiosks were all that were left by the end of 1999. Most of the remaining tenants either relocated to nearby strip malls, or simply went out of business. The nearby residents of the mall started complaining to the city of Salisbury because the structure was literally falling apart. Weeds had started to grow in the parking lot. Final years Salisbury Mall sign The last remaining department store, Peebles, closed its doors on November 21, 2001, leaving only Food Depot, a branch of Sojourner-Douglass College, a martial arts academy, and a handful of small businesses such as Illusion's Games and Comics. The last remaining anchor—Food Depot—closed on November 19, 2003, leaving only a few small shops and the martial arts academy. The final tenant, The Connection, a locally owned clothing store, left the mall on November 23, 2004, relocating to The Twilley Center located directly behind the mall. The mall deteriorated rapidly; the original west wing caught fire due to an electrical short, and the City of Salisbury condemned the building on July 5, 2005. Demolition and redevelopment plans Demolition began on August 8, 2007, and was completed on November 21 of the same year. Cleanup occurred from December 2007 to April 2008: the remaining 40,000 tons of debris, consisting of the steel frame and masonry, was shipped to nearby recyclers. Some masonry remains on site for future use in road beds. Debate is ongoing between the property owners of the property and the local community as to how the property should be used. The original redevelopment plan called for the land to be redeveloped as a mixed-use 685-unit residential/retail complex with a man-made lake, which would be known as The Village at Salisbury Lake. Construction was scheduled to begin in June 2008; however, these plans were put on hold due to the housing slump, and later the Great Recession that followed. On November 12, 2007, the main building contractor, K. Hovnanian Homes of Maryland, LLC, filed suit against the property owner, Salisbury Mall Associates, LLC. The plaintiff was granted permission, by Wicomico County Circuit Court judge Donald C. Davis, to cancel their contract and pull out of the Village at Salisbury Lake development on September 29, 2008. On April 13, 2009, a stay of enforcement was granted to the defendant pending outcome of an appeal to the Maryland Court of Appeals. The defendant was required to post a $24,000 bond based on an estimated 18-month appeal period.Maryland Judiciary Case Search Case 22C07001406. Retrieved February 14, 2010. The appeal was scheduled to be heard on February 3, 2010, as case number 2681/08.February Court Schedule Retrieved February 14, 2010. On July 6, 2011 the Court of Special Appeals vacated the judgement from the Wicomico County Circuit Court. The case was dismissed with prejudice. Since April 2008, the mall site has remained empty except for piles of masonry reserved for future use. On July 10, 2019, the mall site was sold to Crossroads Salisbury, LLC for a residential and commercial development.

It was manufactured in the company's factory at Poissy until 1963. Origins The plant at Poissy had been built by Ford France between 1937 and 1940, but after the war the economic direction of France was uncertain. Ford had equipped the plant to produce the V8 engined Ford Vedette but the government was imposing punitive levels of car tax on cars with large engines and sales fell well short of expectations. In addition, the Poissy plant experienced above average levels of industrial unrest. Simca purchased the plant from Ford in 1954, together with rights to build the latest version of the car produced in it, which now became the Simca Vedette, relaunched by Simca with different model names according to equipment levels. The Simca Vedette competed in France's large car market at a time when the economy was finally returning to growth, and enjoyed moderate success with their fashionably American style finished off by an Italian designer called Rapi. In 1954 the big Simcas competed in France against the Citroën Traction which was still popular despite its twenty-year-old design and the Renault Frégate which struggled to find buyers thanks to a poor mechanical reputation and, it was suggested, from the reluctance of France's haute-bourgeoisie to buy a big expensive car from a state owned enterprise. The Suez Crisis of October 1956 was a catalyst that undermined the position of the V8 Simcas, however, due to the fuel shortages and price increases that it triggered. By this time domestic competition was in any case much intensified by the arrival of the Citroen DS which, despite getting off to a slow start, and despite being stuck with an engine design that had changed little since the 1930s, now became increasingly dominant in France's market for large family cars. It was often asserted that the Simca Ariane's launch was a direct result of the Suez Crisis, but it is now clear that by 1956 Simca's project for a big car with a little engine (\\"une grande voiture à petit moteur\\") had already existed for several years. The urgency of the project was increased in the summer of 1956 when the Simca chief learned of a dastardly plan by Paul Ramadier, the Minister for Economy and Finance, and a still influential former prime minister, to introduce in December 1956 an additional savage annual car tax for owners of cars with larger engines. The Suez crisis simply built on the economic case for a small engined version of the car, and Simca was therefore ready to respond very nimbly to the changed circumstances created by the crisis, fitting a 1290cc \\"Flash\\" series engine from their successful small family car, the Aronde, into the most basic version of their V8 engined Simca Trianon, which was one of the models in the Vedette range. The new car was badged as the \\"Simca Ariane\\" and was soon available in several versions. The car Fitting the body of the former first-generation Simca Vedette with a 1290cc (7CV) Flash four cylinder engine from the much smaller Simca Aronde produced a car that focused on economy rather than speedy acceleration. Presented in April 1957, the Ariane filled the gap between Aronde and Vedette. In October of the same year, the Ariane 8 was presented - a version powered by the same Aquillon 2351 cc (13CV) V-eight-cylinder unit that powered the Vedette. The Ariane 8 effectively replaced the former Simca Trianon, which was a bottom-of-the-range Vedette, as the Vedette range was moved upmarket. The Ariane 8 would be discontinued along with the company's other V8 powered models in 1961, however. For the 1959 model year the company introduced an Ariane Super Luxe with increased levels of chrome trim on the outside as well as vanity mirrors on the inside and a windscreen washer to help the view out. All the Arianes also received restyled tail light clusters at this point which resembled those already used on the more flamboyantly styled but broadly similar Vedette models. Further upgrades to the interior trim were implemented for 1961, and newly available options included bench seats that could now be folded flat to form a double bed of sorts. There followed yet another new name: for the final two years of its life the Ariane was branded as the Simca Miramas. Commercial The Ariane was manufactured until 1963, with 166,363 produced. (published and distributed privately, no ISBN) Towards the end, production slowed strikingly. 33,733 Arianes were produced in 1961, which slumped to just 14,284 during 1962. By this time attention at the company's Poissy plant had switched to the new Simca 1000. The most direct replacement for the Simca Ariane/Miramas would be the Simca 1300/1500, introduced in 1963. Argentina The Ariane Miramas, were made in Argentina by Metalmecánica. Approx. 507 units built until 1967 in two versions: \\"Std\\" and \\"Lujo\\". Simca Ariane, rear view. The increased height of the fins incorporating the tail- light clusters identify this example as a car produced during or after 1959.

Towle Silversmiths was originally founded in 1857 as Towle & Jones by Anthony Francis Towle and William P. Jones, two apprentices to the Moulton family of silversmiths. In 1873 it became A.F. Towle & Son, and then in 1882, Anthony Francis Towle, while still owning A.F. Towle & Son, established the Towle Manufacturing Co. In 1890, the company adopted the trademark of a large script \\"T\\" enclosed by a lion. Richard Dimes, an English silversmith who had immigrated to the U.S. in 1881, started Towle's hollowware line. Dimes, who also worked for the Frank W. Smith Silver Co., would eventually establish his own company, Richard Dimes Co., in Boston. Eventually the company's name was changed to Towle Silversmiths. Over the years, Towle has created numerous sterling silver flatware patterns in the United States: including the \\"Candlelight\\" in 1934, the \\"Marie Louise\\" in 1939 which became the official sterling silver pattern for U.S. embassies worldwide, \\"Old Master\\" in 1942, now considered by some to be the company’s flagship pattern, and the \\"Contour\\" in 1950 (designed by Robert J. King, patented by John Van Koert) which was the first American sterling pattern to manifest post-World War II organic modernist design and the only production-line American flatware included in the Museum of Modern Art's Good Design exhibitions. In 1990, Towle Silversmiths was acquired by the holding company Syratech Inc., that also owned Wallace Silversmiths and the International Silver Company In 2006, Lifetime Brands Inc. purchased Syratech Inc., thereby acquiring all three brands.

She was designed specifically for the Asian cruise market. The keel of the SuperStar Virgo was laid on 18 November 1996, and she was floated out of dry dock on 23 December 1998. She was delivered to Star Cruises on 2 August 1999. Service history SuperStar Virgo Following the transit from Papenburg to Singapore the SuperStar Virgo entered service on cruises from Singapore on 10 October 1999. On 24 April 2003 the SuperStar Virgo was relocated from Singapore to operate cruises out of Perth, Western Australia due to the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Southeast Asia. Initially the redeployment was planned to last only a one- month evaluation period, but SuperStar Virgo continued to be based in Perth until July 2003. On 2 April 2008 the SuperStar Virgo relocated from Singapore to Hong Kong as her port of departure until 26 October 2008, the redeployment coinciding with the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. She returned to Singapore in October 2008. In January 2009, Star Cruises installed a 100m waterslide on the SuperStar Virgo during her dry dock period in Singapore, and in January 2012, received new hull art and livery. Between April and October 2014 she was based in Hong Kong. From 13 November 2015 to 31 December 2015, SuperStar Virgo undertook a 48-day cruise to the Southern Hemisphere with over 20 ports of call.

The component images may either be projected simultaneously or in rapid succession. Subtractive: the color image is physically present as transparent coloring matter in the film. No special projection equipment is required. Mosaic (additive): the film incorporates a mosaic of extremely small color filters, allowing a color image to be photographed as one black-and-white image consisting of many microscopically small color-filtered fragments. The same mosaic reconstitutes the color when the film is projected, so no special equipment is needed. Lenticular (additive): a black-and-white film which has been embossed on its base side with hundreds or thousands of tiny lenses is used for the original photography, base side forward and in conjunction with a segmented multicolored filter on the camera lens. As in mosaic processes, the result is an array of adjacent microscopic black-and-white image fragments that record the color information. Projection must reverse the optical geometry used for photography, so it requires not only a similar segmented filter but also highly compatible and correctly adjusted projection optics. *Inventor: the known inventor(s) of the process. *Introductory film: the first known public showing of the process.

Plant Hall was formerly known as the Tampa Bay Hotel, which was a 511-room resort hotel opened on February 5, 1891 by Henry B. Plant near the terminus of his rail line. The museum's exhibits focus on Gilded Age tourism, the elite lifestyle of the hotel's guests, and the building's use during the Spanish–American War. It was designed by architect J.A. Wood who also created the old Hillsborough County Courthouse and the Oglethorpe Hotel. The museum is open to the public every day except Monday and major holidays. During the Christmas holiday season, the museum hosts the annual Victorian Christmas Stroll. The entire building (under the title of Tampa Bay Hotel) is a U.S. National Historic Landmark, designated as such on December 5, 1972. On April 18, 2012, the AIA's Florida Chapter placed the building on its list of Florida Architecture: 100 Years. 100 Places. History Tampa Bay Hotel, ca. 1900. Hotel rotunda and sitting room in c. 1905 Tampa Bay Hotel The Tampa Bay Hotel was built by railroad magnate Henry B. Plant between 1888 and 1891. The construction cost over $3 million. It was considered the premier hotel of the eight that Plant built to anchor his rail line. The hotel itself covers and is a quarter-mile long. It was equipped with the first elevator ever installed in Florida. The elevator is still working today, making it one of the oldest continually operational elevators in the nation. The 511 rooms and suites were the first in Florida to have electric lights and telephones. Most rooms also included private bathrooms, complete with a full-size tub. The price for a room ranged from $5.00 to $15.00 a night at a time when the average hotel in Tampa charged $1.25 to $2.00. The poured-concrete, steel-reinforced structure of the building was advertised as fireproof. The grounds of the hotel spanned and included a golf course, bowling alley, racetrack, casino and an indoor heated swimming pool. In all, 21 buildings could be found on the hotel's campus. The Moorish Revival architectural theme was selected by Plant because of its exotic appeal to the widely traveled Victorians who would be his primary customers. The hotel has six minarets, four cupolas, and three domes. In the early 1990s, all were restored to their original stainless steel state. From 1889 to 1891 Plant scoured Europe collecting objects to lavishly decorate the hotel. Art arrived \\"by the trainload.\\" Despite the size of the hotel, the purchases he made overflowed the place, and the surplus had to be disposed of at auction. Much of the original art and furnishings has been removed, but the wing conserved as a museum contains \\"a bewildering assortment of rococo bronzes, furniture, clocks, tapestries, paintings, and vases, one vase being a gift from the Emperor of Japan.\\" During its operating period from 1891 to 1930, the hotel housed thousands of guests, including hundreds of celebrities. When the Spanish–American War broke out, Plant convinced the United States military to use his hotel as a base of operations. Generals and high-ranking officers stayed in its rooms to plan invasion strategies, while enlisted men encamped on the hotel's acreage. Colonel Teddy Roosevelt and his Rough Riders also were at the hotel during this time. Roosevelt retained a suite, and during the day led his men in battle exercises on the property. Other visitors of note during the hotel's heyday were Sarah Bernhardt, Clara Barton, Stephen Crane, the Prince of Wales, Winston Churchill, Ignacy Paderewski. Babe Ruth was also a guest of the hotel during its latter days, and signed his first baseball contract in the Grand Dining Room. In 1919, Ruth hit his longest home run (and possibly the longest ever hit in official competition) during a spring training game at Plant Field, adjacent to the hotel. Closing and renewal The Tampa Bay Hotel closed in 1930 as the Great Depression severely curtailed tourism. It remained empty and unused for three years. In late 1933, the Tampa Bay Junior College was allowed to move into the hotel, using the old suites as classrooms and offices. Because of the large amount of space afforded by the hotel, the scope of the junior college was expanded, becoming the University of Tampa. The Tampa Municipal Museum was established by the city to preserve the hotel in its original form and co-exist with the newly established University. In 1941, the city of Tampa signed a 99-year lease with the University of Tampa for $1.00 a year. The lease excluded the southeast wing of the building to allow for the housing of the museum. In 1974, the Tampa Municipal Museum was renamed the Henry B. Plant Museum. Recent Today, besides serving as offices and classrooms for the University of Tampa, the entire south wing of the building is dedicated to preserving the glory days of the old Tampa Bay Hotel. Various rooms in the wing display authentic artifacts from the old hotel, many of which were purchased by Mr. and Mrs. Plant themselves on various European shopping trips. Guided tours and a self- guided tour that starts with a video entitled The Tampa Bay Hotel: Florida's First Magic Kingdom, showcase a life of leisure in old Florida. Programs for Lifelong Learning Picnic in the Park is a program where adults and families can simply relax on the lawns or try their hand at Victorian games, such as horseshoes, badminton, and croquet. Interpreters are present in traditional Victorian costumes and there is live entertainment on the Center Stage. Upstairs/Downstairs is a live theatre program that teaches visitors about the early years of the Tampa Bay Hotel. These presentations are given by characters talking about their experiences. Characters are based either wholly or in part on actual guests or staff of the hotel. Music in the Museum is a live music series, serving as a throwback to days when the hotel featured daily concerts. The museum occasionally holds antiques evaluations, similar to what you might see on Antiques Roadshow. First Fridays is a program that occurs monthly, where admission to the museum is free, and visitors can enjoy a tasting table and live jazz music. Special exhibitions \\"Victorian Christmas stroll\\" at the museum. The museum also hosts special exhibitions, in 2015 it is hosting Passionate Design: The American Arts & Crafts Movement, a special exhibition of material from the collection of the Museum of the American Arts and Crafts Movement, now under construction in St. Petersburg, Florida. Partnerships The Plant Museum is a part of the Tampa Downtown Partnership, which serves the downtown community through initiatives such as developing greater transportation to make downtown more accessible and keeping downtown clean. Accreditation The museum is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums. Plant Park and hotel grounds A view of Plant Park. Plant Hall is in the background, and the Sticks of Fire sculpture can be seen to the left The Spanish–American War gun, which replaced the first weapon originally located at Fort Dade on Egmont Key. One of Plant Park's walking paths The hotel once featured many attractions, most located in what is now known as Plant Park. Today, as part of both the University of Tampa's campus and the museum's grounds, several can still be seen. At the entrance to the park is the \\"Henry Bradley Plant Memorial Fountain,\\" commissioned by Margaret Plant in 1899 after her husband's death. The fountain title is Transportation, and reflects Mr. Plant's system of trains and ships with carved representations of each on the sculpture. The fountain was carved from solid stone by George Grey Barnard, and is the oldest public art in the city of Tampa. It was completely conserved in 1995. Facing the Hillsborough River near the University of Tampa's library are two historic cannon from Fort Brooke, the early 19th century military post (established 1824) around which Tampa developed. The two guns are model 1819 iron 24-pounder seacoast guns, and were originally part of a three-gun Confederate battery guarding Tampa Bay during the Civil War. On May 6, 1864, a Union naval raiding party captured Fort Brooke and, before withdrawing the next day, disabled the three heavy cannon by blowing one trunnion off of each (trunnions are the side projections on which cannon pivot to elevate or depress). This damage is still evident on the two Plant Park guns today. In the 1890s, Henry Plant moved two of the long- abandoned cannon from the site of the old fort to the grounds of his new Tampa Bay Hotel, placing them in a small earthwork revetment as a curiosity for the hotel's guests. Later the guns were placed on plinths made of coquina blocks. Recently Tampa's Rough Riders civic group remounted the Fort Brooke cannon on replica gun carriages in a new stone revetment in Plant Park. The lost third Fort Brooke cannon was for many years a lawn decoration at 901 Bayshore Boulevard, but was donated to a World War II scrap metal drive on October 9, 1942. Facing Kennedy Boulevard in Plant Park is another historic weapon, this one an impressive turn-of-the-century coast defense gun. It memorializes the important part Tampa played in the 1898 Spanish–American War, and symbolically points south towards Cuba. The inscription on the gun's monumental base describes it as an eight-inch (203 mm) gun on a \\"disappearing carriage\\" taken from Fort Dade, an old coastal defense fort located on Egmont Key at the mouth of Tampa Bay. The true story is a bit more complicated. The original Fort Dade gun described on the base was emplaced in Plant Park in November 1927, but was donated to a steel scrap drive during World War II. Following the war, an eight-inch (203 mm) gun of similar vintage (both were M1888 weapons) was obtained from Fort Morgan, Alabama and installed on the 1927 memorial's vacant plinth. The new gun is mounted on the top portion of a 1918 railway gun carriage dating from World War I rather than the \\"disappearing carriage\\" of the original Fort Dade weapon. Plant Park once housed a small zoo located along Biology Creek, a stream that runs down part of the park. The creek is fed from an underground spring that comes up beneath the hotel and empties a few hundred yards away into the Hillsborough River. In its heyday, the zoo contained a bear and an alligator, plus many smaller animals. It was famous for its hundreds of squirrels and small lizards, which are still on campus. The bear and alligator were eventually moved upriver and became the core attractions for what is now the Lowry Park Zoo. The creek's name derives from a later period in its history, when students from the university used its water to conduct various biology experiments. Finally, a statue called Au Coup de Fusil, meaning,The Shot (as in gunshot or rifle shot), can be found right outside the hotel. These two bronze hounds represent two fine pointers being alerted by the sound of a gunshot.Art Bronze Fine Sculptures http://www.artbronze.com/aucoupdefusilbyeglantinelemaitre.aspx They were sculpted by famed canine sculptor Eglantine Lemaître (French, 1852–1920) and were cast in France by Maurice Denonvilliers in 1890. Originally, they faced south rather than north, and their rapt attention was focused on a small bronze squirrel placed in a low hanging oak limb. However, this was a misinterpretation of the piece, as evidenced by the hounds' attention being diverted in different directions. The squirrel eventually was stolen and the dogs were moved to their current location. Supposedly the two dogs represent Mr. Plant's personal favorite hunting dogs, and the hotel itself had kennels stocked with hunting dogs for guests use on hunting expeditions. The Friends of Plant Park (FoPP) is a Florida non-profit corporation with the mission to (a) assist with the restoration, preservation and maintenance of The Henry B. Plant Park, Tampa, Florida, as a botanical garden open to the general public, (b) research and publicize the Victorian history of The Henry B. Plant Park, and (c) educate the public and cultivate community interest in and support for the foregoing activities. This group was formed in 1993. Since 1997 the FoPP has hosted the annual 'GreenFest' activities in Henry B. Plant Park to raise money. To date those funds, along with contributions from individuals, organizations, the City of Tampa, and Hillsborough County, have allowed for the restoration of and new exhibit of the cannons, the Victorian star-shaped garden bed, and a replica of the 112 foot flagpole with a 12X18-foot replica of the 45-star American flag (1891). The original flagpole was probably a ship's mast and a Florida state flag and a University of Tampa flag will fly from the replica's crossbars.Bylaws of The Friends of Henry B. Plant Park, Inc.

The station broadcasts at a transmitter power output of 5,000 Watts during the day and 1,000 Watts at night, and serves central and eastern Massachusetts. Since January 2005, the station has been broadcasting full-time in Spanish with a tropical format. The station is the only full-time Spanish-language station serving central Massachusetts, especially Worcester's rapidly increasing Latino population. WORC's programming is also heard on translator station W291DB (106.1 FM). History A one-time affiliate of both the CBS and ABC radio networks, WORC from 1955 until 1984 had a top 40 format. In late 1984, the station began programming country music. When the station was purchased by The Davis Advertising Company of Worcester in 1989, the format became oldies, as management attempted to re- create the excitement of WORC's early rock and roll years. By August 1994, the oldies format was gradually being phased out in favor of a talk format. Davis eventually sold WORC to the present owners who instituted the current format. Hall of fame DJ, Dave O'Gara was the morning man for two decades in the 1970s through the 80's. Other notable on air jocks were Mark Ericson and Tim Fontaine, known on WORC as Big John Fontaine. Fontaine moved to the PM drive slot in NH WERZ where his show made Billboard Magazine when he promoted toll free ride home amidst a NH toll hike. Ericson also moved to NH as the PD of Country juggernaut WOKQ. Ericson was also the famed New England voice of many race and dragway commercials still copied and revered today.

The highway continues southbound as Highway 19 until it reaches the northern end of Campbell River, at the intersection of Highway 19 and Highway 19A. At this point, Highway 19A becomes the Island Highway, and runs south through Courtenay, Union Bay, Fanny Bay, and Qualicum Beach until it reaches Parksville (this section of the highway is often referred to as the Oceanside Route).

Background and career overview A Hong Kong native with American citizenship, Chan received a bachelor's degree in social sciences from the University of Hong Kong and a master's in journalism from the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Chan moved to the United States in 1972 to pursue a graduate degree at the University of Michigan. She later worked for the New York Daily News. In 1999, Chan founded the Journalism and Media Studies Centre at the University of Hong Kong, with it offering both graduate and undergraduate degrees in journalism. She then led the centre as Director until 2016. She also established the Cheung Kong School of Journalism and Communication at Shantou University in Guangdong, China, and became its first dean. In October 2016, she joined Hong Kong public policy think tank Civic Exchange as a Distinguished Fellow.Civic Exchange announcement, 17 Oct 2016 Liu Tai-ying libel action In 1996, Chan collaborated with Shieh Chung- liang, the Taiwan bureau chief of the Hong Kong-based magazine Yazhou Zhoukan to investigate possible Taiwanese contributions to US President Bill Clinton's re-election campaign. The pair wrote an article that appeared on 25 October reporting that Liu Tai-ying, the business manager of Taiwan's Kuomintang political party, had offered $15 million to Mark Middleton, an ex-Clinton White House aide. The article included a denial from Liu that he had offered the money. Liu went on to file a criminal libel suit against the pair on 7 November. Chen Chao-ping, a political consultant named as the source of the story, was added as a co-defendant. Liu also filed a civil suit for $15 million in damages. Calling the trial \\"a test case for press freedom in Asia\\", The Committee to Protect Journalists filed an amicus brief on their behalf, as did ten major US media companies. The Kuomintang called a special meeting to endorse the libel suit and condemn Chan and Shieh. However, a Taiwanese district court ruled in the pair's favour on 22 April 1997. The ruling was \\"hailed as a landmark decision\\" for press freedom by media watchdog groups, in part because Judge Lee Wei-shen's decision acknowledged the constitutional right to a free press for the first time in Taiwanese judicial history. Other career activity In 2006, she strongly criticised the search engine Google for censoring its Chinese service, calling it \\"a missed opportunity to help nurture free journalism in the country\\".  Awards and honours  Chan's honours include a 1995 Nieman Fellowship at Harvard University and a George Polk Award for excellence in American journalism. In November 1997, the Committee to Protect Journalists gave Chan and Shieh its International Press Freedom Award, \\"an annual recognition of courageous journalism\\". The award citation stated that \\"[Chan and Shieh's] courage sets an example in a region noted for both widespread self-censorship and government intervention in the functioning of the press.\\" In August 2013, the Asian American Journalists Association honoured Chan with a Lifetime Achievement Award, citing her media studies leadership roles at HKU and Shantou University. \\"Through journalism programs at both universities she is raising a new generation of questioning, curious and fair journalists right on the doorstep of mainland China,\\" the award citation said in part.

Biography At the age of 16, Lee began his career in the comic book industry after graduating high school by sending approximately 150 pages of sample artworks to uninterested Marvel and DC editors. It took over a year before he caught the attention of Image co-founder Rob Liefeld at a convention in Toronto, Canada in 1994. Four months later, he was hired by Image Comics and went to train at Extreme Studios. There, he learned a skill that would influence his art to a great degree: speed. In an interview with Wizard he states: Lee worked on various titles such as Bloodpool, Extreme Sacrifice, Black Flag, House of M: Iron Man, Glory, Darkchylde, Avengeblade, Extreme Prelude, and Prophet. Soon after, he was hired in Wildstorm Productions to work on Jim Lee's WildC.A.T.S., Allegra and Whilce Portacio's Wetworks.

Dreamwave A year later, he and his brother Roger founded Dreamwave Productions. They began to publish their first mini-series Darkminds followed by other titles like Transformers, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Warlands, Fate of the Blade, NecroWar, Sandscape and other graphic novels. Dreamwave filed for bankruptcy in January 2005, amidst a great deal of controversy, such as the fact that he was neglecting to pay several artists.\\"Dreamwave Productions Closes Up Shop\\", Comic Book Resources, January 4, 2005. Retrieved January 9th, 2011. Work for hire When Dreamwave Productions closed, Lee formed a new production company known as Dream Engine and parlayed his work on the Transformers franchise to land a string of jobs for Marvel and DC, most notably an X-Men/Fantastic Four mini-series and an arc on the Superman/Batman series for DC. He also contributed to a relaunch of Cyberforce for Top Cow Productions, another Image studio. Most of the new projects with Dream Engine failed to bring Lee the high-profile acclaim of his Transformers work, with the Washington Times in particular criticizing his ability to draw humans versus the larger than life robots from Transformers. Lee directed the music video for the song Electric by the band Blush. Lee was also a concept designer on CGI cartoon Train Hero (高铁侠) for Carloon Animation. Controversy Since the closure of Dreamwave, Pat Lee has been criticized for his business practices. In an interview with Newsarama, Transformers writers Adam Patyk and James McDonough stated they had been laid off before the Dreamwave bankruptcy following a controversy about their payment, and had subsequently filed a lawsuit against Dreamwave for lack of payment.Alex Segura Jr.: \\"The Dreamwave Bankruptcy: From the Writers Point of View\\" , Newsarama com, July 26th, 2005.

While Lee admitted that \\"many artists had delays in payment\\" even before the bankruptcy and \\"regret[s] not being able to speak to everyone\\" beforehand, he also claimed that \\"most creators at Dreamwave were aware that we were going through financial difficulties. We didn’t announce it, but people were not being paid in full, and it was pretty obvious.\\" He also claimed that \\"I barely paid myself at Dreamwave, and didn’t pay myself for extended periods so that the company could pay other bills.\\" Regarding the Porsche, Lee claimed that it \\"was leased by Dreamwave and I was personally responsible for the vehicle at the end\\", whereas the apartment was a \\"small apartment in Toronto that I paid a mortgage on\\". Regarding Alex Milne's work as a ghost artist on Cyberforce, Lee claimed that he \\"forgot to adjust the credits at the end of the job\\", which was \\"definitely my error\\", and offered Milne to \\"provide me the appropriate documentation and evidence\\" that \\"Dream Engine owed him money\\". He also claimed that \\"I don’t recall firing Alex\\", and that he \\"expressed to him via email in May 2007 that I understood he was paid in full\\". Other allegations brought up by Johnston in the interview, namely that Top Cow had told him [Johnston] that Lee had specifically assured them that he was doing all the work on Cyberforce himself, and that Marvel had told him [Johnston] that they were \\"asked to stop paying money to Dreamwave [for outsourced projects such as the X-Men/Fantastic Four limited series] but send it to Dream Engine instead\\", were not addressed by Lee at all. Lee also did not respond to the specific request to offer evidence to counter the claim that he was trying to \\"siphon money from big gigs away from Dreamwave to Dream Engine in the months before the bankruptcy\\". However, Lee announced plans to set up a \\"Creative Refund Movement\\" with the specific intention to \\"raise funds to pay former Dreamwave artists who were financially affected by the bankruptcy\\".Rich Johnston: \\"Pat Lee Talks To Bleeding Cool Via A Dabel Brother\\", Bleeding Cool, December 20, 2010.

It was once one of the longest state highways in the Oklahoma road system, but now has a total length of . Route description State Highway 18 was commissioned in August 1924 and, at one time, traveled from Dickson, Oklahoma to Shidler, Oklahoma at the Kansas border. Much of SH-18 has been replaced by US-177. The current Highway 18 begins in Shawnee, Oklahoma at an interchange with US-177/270 and SH-3W. The highway is known as Harrison Street through Shawnee. After Shawnee, SH-18 intersects with US-62 in Meeker, Oklahoma and then into Chandler, Oklahoma concurrent with SH-66. The highways split after leaving Chandler's business district. SH-18 intersects with I-44 and then travels on to Agra, Oklahoma. At Agra, SH-18 joins with SH-33 heading into Cushing, Oklahoma where SH-18 separates and heads to Pawnee, Oklahoma. South of there, the highway overlaps US-64 for two miles (3 km). SH-18 crosses the Arkansas River in Ralston, Oklahoma and intersects with SH-20. Near the Osage Indian Reservation, SH-18 joins with SH-11 at US-60 and remains joined until Shidler, where SH-11 separates. later SH-18 becomes K-15 as it crosses the state line into Kansas. Old 18 US-177 replaced SH-18 between Dickson and Shawnee in 1967. Dickson to Asher US-177 runs roughly on top of the previous SH-18 between Dickson and Asher, Oklahoma, therefore only a few small segments of the original highway remain through that stretch. Asher to Shawnee Old SH-18 north of Asher Much of the old highway from south of Asher to Tecumseh, Oklahoma still remains. Remnants of the old highway begin north of the curve just before US-177 junctions with SH-3W, south of the Canadian River. SH 18 (now US-177) originally continued straight ahead and then turned slightly ahead of where US-177 does now. The existing old highway runs parallel west of US-177 for about a mile, before terminating short of the Canadian River. Originally, the highway continued straight for about another (taking it over the river) before veering east and then back north. The cement supports of the old bridge can still be seen if you look westward at the north and south banks, while crossing the Canadian River bridge (coincidentally, the bridge may return to that location if reports of replacing the Canadian River Bridge are true). Much of the section after the river and before the highway intersects with SH-39 has been lost due to another bridge being removed. The existing highway picks up again after a second removed bridge and before intersecting with SH-39 south of Asher. The highway continues north through Asher (here named Division Street) for before again veering east and then once more travels roughly north. The road is mostly intact except for a small area near Pearson, Oklahoma where it is rerouted to cross SH-59. North of Pearson is the Salt Creek Bridge, a 120' long OSHC standard design, built in 1930. Salt Creek Bridge Near Macomb, Oklahoma the old highway again travels parallel and very near to US-177. The highway is interrupted once because of the removed Little River Bridge before reaching the Brooksville, Oklahoma area. Here, the highway is slightly rerouted to cross US-177 (veering west) and then heads north toward Tecumseh. The designation \\"Old 18\\" ends here as the highway has been absorbed into city streets, although it appears the highway traveled east down what is now Highland, then north on Broadway and continued to Shawnee on what is now Gordon Cooper Drive/Beard Street. Beard Street intersects with Farrall Street in Shawnee, which is the current SH-18. East of this intersection, SH-18 ends and loops into US-177. West of the intersection, Farrall veers north and merges into Harrison Avenue. At this point, 18 continues as a current state highway. Notes * There is roughly of drivable road designated \\"Old 18\\" between US-177 / SH-3W Junction south of Asher and Tecumseh, although it can not be driven continuously. * The longest uninterrupted stretch of Old 18 is about , between Asher and the Little River near Brooksville. * Except for a 1½ mile repaved stretch through Asher, Old 18 shows its original concrete construction (although heavily patched with pavement). * At its furthest, Old 18 rests 1½ miles east of its replacement, US-177. * The curved edges and poor drainage of the highway can make it dangerous during heavy rain as it greatly retains water. * The original Canadian River Bridge south of Asher was in use from 1921 to 1967. It has since been removed. Spurs SH-18 has two lettered spurs. *SH-18A no longer connects to current SH-18.

Set in Hawaii and Southeast Asia at the end of the Vietnam War, the book tells the story of Inez Victor, wife of U.S. Senator and one-time presidential hopeful Harry Victor, and her enduring romance with Jack Lovett, a CIA agent/war profiteer whom Inez first met as a teenager living in Hawaii. Democracy is unusual in that its narrator is not a character within the novel's world but a voice whom Didion identifies as herself, a writer self-consciously struggling with the ambiguities of her ostensible material, the ironies attendant to narration, and the inevitable contradictions at the heart of any story-telling. Didion's deft and economical use of this conceit allows her to comment not only upon the novel she chose to write, a romantic tragedy, but also upon the novel she chose not to write, a family epic encompassing generations of Inez's wealthy Hawaiian family, artless emblems of the colonial impulse. At the time Democracy was published, the work was widely recognized as Didion's best novel to date for the skillful way she combined reportorial skill with literary style. However, some critics felt the book's realism undercut its overall achievement as a novel.

The film follows Force Recon veteran Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg), who is framed for murder by a rogue unit of personnel operating for a private military firm. The film also stars Michael Peña, Danny Glover, Kate Mara, Levon Helm, and Ned Beatty. It was produced by Lorenzo di Bonaventura through Di Bonaventura Pictures, and released by Paramount Pictures in the United States on March 23, 2007. Plot USMC Force Recon Gunnery Sergeant sniper Bob Lee Swagger is participating in a mission in Eritrea with his spotter and close friend Corporal Donnie Fenn. They help an allied convoy evade the enemy, but Donnie is subsequently killed in the firefight against the enemy militia forces. Three years later, Swagger, now a disillusioned civilian, is living in a self-imposed exile in a secluded log cabin. At the office of an unnamed Private Military Company in Langley, Virginia, a retired US Army Colonel named Isaac Johnson and his associates review Swagger's combat operation report and his Certificate of Discharge. They visit him and ask him to provide his expertise in preventing a possible assassination of the US president during his upcoming speech tour. Swagger reluctantly agrees. Johnson gives him a list of possible assassination sites, and Swagger concludes that Independence Hall in Philadelphia is the only place where the assassination could happen, with the assassin having to fire a 2000-yard shot. On the day of the Philadelphia speech, Swagger is working with Johnson's men and Timmons, a Philadelphia police officer, to find the assassin. However, the shot is fired. Swagger is suddenly betrayed and shot by Timmons, but he manages to escape. The conspirators frame Swagger for the assassination, and a manhunt ensues. Swagger subdues an inexperienced FBI agent, Nick Memphis, and steals his car, crashing it into the Delaware River. He then clings to the side of a barge to evade pursuing forces. Continuing to evade the manhunt, Swagger tries to treat his injuries and takes refuge with Sarah, Donnie's widow. He learns that the Ethiopian archbishop was killed instead of the president. Sarah finishes treating his injuries. Upon recovering, Swagger persuades her to help him tip off Memphis. Memphis, who was scapegoated for Swagger's escape and is due for professional review, argues that given Swagger's training and expertise, it is suspicious that he \\"missed\\" the president by several feet and hit the archbishop instead. He suspects that Swagger was framed for the assassination and is further convinced when he learns that the policeman that shot Swagger was murdered shortly afterward. After getting tips about Swagger from a disguised Sarah, he attempts to access Delta-level classified information at the FBI office. Johnson and his men are tipped off by the Delta-level request and realize that Memphis is about to expose them. They order him abducted and try to stage his suicide. They also abduct Sarah at her residence. However, Swagger arrives at Memphis' kidnappers' hideout and kills them all. He and Memphis begin working together, starting by visiting a firearms expert who explains to them the technique used for fudging the assassination's ballistics data and who lists the shooters capable of firing the shot. They locate the assassin, who reveals that the archbishop was the intended target. He was murdered to stop him from revealing that a consortium of corporate oil interests led by corrupt US senator Charles Meachum ordered an Eritrean village massacred to build an oil pipeline. Swagger records this statement. The assassin tells Swagger that Sarah has been abducted, then commits suicide. Swagger and Memphis are ambushed by a mercenary group deployed with Meachum's authorization of Johnson's orders, but manage to kill their attackers and escape. They contact Johnson and agree to exchange Sarah for the recording of the assassin's confession. Johnson, Meachum, Sarah, and a few mercenaries meet Swagger and Memphis on a mountaintop. Swagger kills all three of the mercenary snipers. They exchange Sarah for the tape, and then surrender to the FBI. Swagger is brought before the US attorney general and the FBI director in a private meeting with Colonel Johnson, Memphis, and Sarah. Swagger quickly clears his name by aiming his loaded rifle (present as evidence, as it was supposedly used in the assassination) at Johnson and pulling the trigger; it fails to fire. Swagger explains that every time he leaves his house, he switches out the firing pins of his guns; this renders them inoperable. Although Swagger is exonerated, Johnson cannot be prosecuted as Africa is outside US jurisdiction. The attorney general tells Swagger that he must abide by the law and to refrain from vigilantism, \\"even though sometimes that's exactly what's needed.\\" Swagger is released. A while later, Johnson and Meachum are sitting in a secluded cabin discussing their next operation. Swagger breaks in and kills both men and their associates. He causes the cabin to blow up as though by accident and then leaves with Sarah.

The author Stephen Hunter also tried to adapt the book but was put off by the experience and disconnected himself from the process. Jonathan Lemkin read the book and some of the previous drafts and was able to avoid repeating some of the same mistakes. Lemkin updated the story away from the original post Vietnam setting, and restructured the story bringing the main event to the end of the first act, and to cut the multiple plot lines down to just the A story. His page 1 rewrite of the screenplay attracted Wahlberg and Fuqua, and on his second draft, the film got the green light to go into production. Unusually for a screenplay with such a long development process and multiple rewrites, Lemkin retained sole credit after Writers Guild of America arbitration. Locations Most of the film was shot on location in New Westminster, Kamloops, Mission, Ashcroft and Cache Creek in British Columbia, Canada. For example, Swagger's escape was filmed in New Westminster along the Fraser River, standing in for the Delaware River. The car chase that ends when it plunged into the river was filmed down 6th Street and off the Westminster Quay. The following scene of Swagger clinging to the side of a dredger was also filmed on the Fraser River near the Pattullo Bridge. The assassination scenes were filmed in Independence National Historical Park in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia. The sniper location was created from using the exteriors of the church steeple at the junction of New Street and North 4th Street and combining them with an elevated view from another building to create a fictional vista of the park. The final scene was in Mammoth Lakes, California, in the lakes basin. The mountaintop confrontation was shot on the glaciers of Rainbow Mountain, near the resort town of Whistler, British Columbia.http://madeinatlantis.com/movies_central/2007/shooter.htm Weapons and tactics Shooter depicts a number of sniper tactics, thanks to the guidance of former US Marine scout sniper Patrick Garrity, who trained Mark Wahlberg for the film. Garrity taught Wahlberg to shoot both left- and right- handed (the actor is left-handed), as he had to switch shooting posture throughout the movie, due to Swagger's sustained injuries. He was also trained to adjust a weapon's scope, judge effects of wind on a shot, do rapid bolt manipulation, and develop special breathing skills. His training included extreme distance shooting (up to 1,100 yards/1,006 m), and the use of camouflage ghillie suits. Fuqua appointed Garrity as the film's military- technical advisor. In the special features of the DVD, Garrity is interviewed pointing out that the shot fired in the assassination would not have hit the archbishop straight on, as in the film. When a round is fired it will fall from 30–40 feet (9.1–12.2 m) depending on the distance of the shot. To compensate, the round is fired at an arc calibrated by how far the round is going to fall, the distance of the shot, temperature, humidity, and wind. In his interview, Garrity said \\"At 1,800 yards (1,646 m), because of the hydrostatic shock that follows a large-caliber, high-velocity round such as the .408 Chey Tac (which is used in the shot), the target would literally be peeled apart and limbs would be flying 200 feet (61 m) away.\\" The exit wound on the archbishop's head would have been too extreme to show in movie theaters. Instead, the movie depicts a much less graphic representation of the assassination. Throughout the film, Swagger uses an array of sniper rifles, among which are the USMC M40A3, the CheyTac Intervention, and the Barrett M82. Music The score to the film was composed by Mark Mancina, who recorded the music at the Todd-AO Scoring Stage in Studio City, Los Angeles, using a 77-piece orchestra conducted by Don Harper.\\"Scoring Session Photo Gallery\\". Retrieved 2011-11-25. A score soundtrack was released by Lakeshore Records on March 27, 2007. The song \\"Nasty Letter\\" by Otis Taylor plays over the end of the film and credits. Reception Box office Shooter grossed $47 million in the US and Canada and $48.7 million in other territories, for a total gross of $95.7 million against its $61 million production budget. The film grossed $14.5 million in its opening weekend, finishing in 3rd at the box office behind TMNT ($24.3 million) and 300 ($19.9 million). Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 47% approval rating based on 147 reviews; the average rating is 5.6/10. The site's consensus reads, \\"With an implausible story and numerous plot holes, Shooter fails to distinguish itself from other mindless action-thrillers.\\" Metacritic assigns the film a weighted average score of 53 out of 100, based on reviews from 33 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times calls the film \\"a thoroughly reprehensible, satisfyingly violent entertainment about men and guns and things that go boom.\\" Dargis describes director Fuqua's technique as overshot and overedited, but says he has a knack for chaos and the result is \\"pretty enjoyable.\\" Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter gave a positive review but was critical of the weak characterization: \\"If the movie only lavished as much thought and care on its characters as it does on each intricate set piece, Shooter might have been a classic.\\" Honeycutt says the problem is the screenplay by Jonathan Lemkin, and the source novel Point of Impact by film critic and author Stephen Hunter. He highlights Peña for his performance, and praise the technical aspects of the film, particularly the stunt work, and the camera work of Peter Menzies Jr. Tony Horkins of Empire magazine praised the movie: \\"The sequel-ready Swagger challenges Bourne's supremacy with an impressive shoot-'em-up, work-it-out action drama\\". Some film critics saw the film as left-leaning in its politics, including arguing that the main villain (Senator Meachum) is an analogy for then Vice President Dick Cheney. Home media The DVD was released on June 26, 2007, reaching the top of the US sales charts. The film earned $57.6 million in DVD sales in the North America.https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Shooter#tab=summary Reboot TV show  In 2016, USA Network picked up a series of the same name based on the movie, with Wahlberg as a producer and Ryan Phillippe as Swagger.

The digital audio samples, which is the internal representation of the analog inputs, are summed to what is known as a master channel to produce a combined output. A professional digital mixing console is a dedicated desk or control surface produced exclusively for the task, and is typically more robust in terms of user control, processing power and quality of audio effects. However, a computer with proper controller hardware can act as the device for the digital mixing console since it can mimic its interface, input and output. Yamaha M7CL in place for a live production Uses Digital mixing consoles are typically used in recording studios, public address systems, sound reinforcement systems, broadcasting, television, and film post- production. Common sound system problems and solutions Most DMCs are expensive and sophisticated tools. The most common issue related to the DMC is the complex structure, which can be difficult to navigate without previous experience or knowledge of the system. The user usually requires a basic understanding of signal flow, audio terminology, and hardware implementation. Part of the solution to alleviate operator issues is to automate whenever possible. The advent of modern digital computer technology has now made it possible to install sound system components that will almost operate themselves. When upgrading or installing new sound systems, it is advantageous to install items that require as little hands-on, human operation as possible. A digital mixing console can offset the lack of operator experience because it can store the settings programmed by an expert mixer. For example: A knowledgeable person can adjust all of the microphone settings, monitors, etc. for a given event. After everything is properly adjusted, that set-up is assigned a name and stored in the memory. Afterwards, a less knowledgeable operator can simply select that setting on their console or computer. One can easily program many different preset configurations or \\"snapshots,\\" into the mixing console. Default configurations that are included with the DMC are known as presets. Once a stored setting is recalled, the operator can still make manual volume adjustments, etc., without affecting the stored program. In other words, they can change a lot of stuff and all one has to do is hit the recall and the mixer automatically returns to all of the correct start-up settings. Another pitfall in terms of live applications is improper location of the equipment. No sound operator can properly adjust a live sound system unless he can hear exactly what the majority of the audience hears, yet for issues related to space, appearance and security, one cannot always locate their sound control equipment in the middle of their auditorium. This is even more of a problem if the auditorium is a multi-use building that is often converted for other events. A digital mixer may solve this problem: a sound operator can operate the whole sound system from a laptop computer. With the proper set-up, it can even be done by a wireless tablet for increased mobility. In fact, many of the digital mixer's functions are easier to operate from a computer screen than the actual mixing console. Digidesign's Venue Profile mixer on location at a corporate event. This mixer allows plugins from third-party vendors. A Smaart software screen is partially shown on the right—Smaart allows plugins, too. Another advantage of DMCs is the abundance of control features that it provides for each input channel. The built-in effects of typical DMCs are robust and include gates, compressor limiters, equalizers, feedback controllers, and other signal processing hardware. One advantage of the large number of internal effects is that a DMC system is less vulnerable to failure and outside interference than a set-up using outboard hardware. Many digital mixers have controls that mimic the classic look and feel of analog mixers. This is comparable to a fly-by-wire system in modern aircraft. The controls are similar, but the underlying mechanism has changed from voltage levels to binary information. Third-party plug ins can add functionality in a digital mixer. Plugins allow for further expansion of the mixer's on-board equalization, compression and reverberation effects. Using dual DMCs to improve live recording In truly professional broadcast and recording applications, one does not use what is referred to as the house mix for high quality audio recordings. The reason for this is that when engineering live sound for any auditorium, one must deal with the acoustic parameters of that particular auditorium. This requires various adjustments of equalization, bass, treble, volume, etc. While those adjustments may enhance the sound quality in the auditorium, they are not necessarily needed for the recording. In fact, those house mix adjustments often diminish the quality of the recorded sound. Once the bass, treble, volume and other effects of the house mix are added to the recording mix, it is most difficult to correct. In the reverse, adjustments and signal processing effects that are often used to enhance a recording mix are not always needed in the house mix. In order to facilitate this, the signals must be split and provided to OB, recording crew or film crews. This split can be analog or digital; an analog split will normally be a feed of all stage signals split either passively or through an isolated transformer split. Transformers are preferred as they provide isolation and prevent microphone preamps on different systems interacting, for example a recording pre-amp causing level change at FOH or Monitors. A digital split can come in many forms, Often AES/EBU, MADI, Firewire direct to DAW, or increasingly network aware digital snake formats, such as AVB, Dante, Ethersound or Rocknet, many other proprietary formats also exist.

It is based on the 2007 film of the same name. Console version Storyline The game begins with Wilbur Robinson doing some time-traveling of his own, risking both his safety and the time stream in the process. Despite his father's warning not to mess with the time machine while he's away on a business trip, Wilbur doesn't seem fazed. Soon, the second time machine is stolen by the Bowler Hat Guy and Wilbur ends up following him into the past. It is here where Wilbur accidentally knocks down Stanley and Lizzie, disrupting the time stream in the process. With their projects ruined and their dreams crushed, an alternate future develops. Carl immediately calls Wilbur back to the future, realizing that their world is now under the dangerous control of Emperor Stanley and Queen Lizzie. It is up to Wilbur to fix the time stream before he can go back to pursue the Bowler Hat Guy, events which lead straight-up to Wilbur's entrance in the movie. Gameplay The game follows Wilbur through 40 missions and 6 different locales, a few of which are revisited in the movie. Secret Blueprints allow the player to \\"build\\" different Cheats and Extras, using Cornelius Robinson's Transmogrifier. This machine creates items using Base Components which Wilbur collects during his adventure. A Breakout like game called Chargeball is both featured in the game itself and as an extra gameplay option. Different Chargeball \\"maps\\" can be found throughout game and it is up to Wilbur to become the Chargeball champion. Original actors such as Wesley Singerman, Harland Williams, Adam West, Nicole Sullivan, and Stephen Anderson reprise their roles for the Robinson family, while Daniel Hansen (Lewis) doesn't appear in the game at all. The locations in this game include: Ancient Egypt, the Robinsons' house, the Robinsons' basement, Joyce Williams Elementary School, the alternate future, Magma Industries, and Old Town. Game Boy Advance version Storyline After Lewis returns to the past and prepares for his new life, Wilbur arrives back home only to find that his house has been invaded by several hundred Mini-Doris hats. He learns that Mini-Doris, which Frannie's Frogs originally captured, has made its way to Robinson Industries to begin cloning herself. Wilbur travels back into the past in the hopes that Lewis will be able to help him again, an offer which Lewis is at first reluctant to take. Gameplay Exclusively developed for the Game Boy Advance, the Climax Studios game features a completely different storyline and uses a mix of side-scrolling, top-view, and flying levels (for the Time Machine) throughout. Both Wilbur and Lewis are able to create and activate several different inventions by finding invention pieces throughout the levels. In addition, InventCo Egg-Timers and Gift Boxes are hidden throughout; collecting enough of these will unlock special \\"Goodies\\" on the main menu. In addition, a \\"Battery\\" meter serves as both a life gauge and a power gauge for the many different inventions. The events of the game take place immediately after the movie, rather than before like in the Buena Vista Games version. Inexplicably, this is also the only Meet the Robinsons game which features Lewis as a main playable character. Due to the limitations of the Game Boy Advance, no voice-acting is featured. Nintendo DS version The Nintendo DS version is a third-person shooter with a simplified version of the console storyline, borrowing familiar game elements, such as the Dissembler and Charge Glove as well as adding exclusive ones. It follows the console version in four different worlds; Egypt, Lizzy, Stanley, and finally the Bowler Hat Guy's robotic hat- Doris, that ensures a final battle for the future. The Nintendo DS version also includes chargeball as well, just as the console version. Reception Results of the game were average to mixed.

For example, the charged-current contribution to the → elastic scattering amplitude :\\\\mathfrak{M}^{\\\\mathrm{CC}} \\\\propto J_{\\\\mu}^{\\\\mathrm{(CC)}}(\\\\mathrm{e^{-}}\\\\to u_{\\\\mathrm{e}}) \\\\; J^{\\\\mathrm{(CC)}\\\\mu}( u_{\\\\mathrm{e}}\\\\to\\\\mathrm{e^{-}}) where the charged currents describing the flow of one fermion into the other are given by :J^{\\\\mathrm{(CC)\\\\mu}}(f\\\\to f') = \\\\bar{u}_{f'}\\\\gamma^{\\\\mu}\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(1-\\\\gamma^{5}\\\\right)u_{f}.  In simple terms  Charged current interaction is the most easily detected of the interactions of the weak force. The weak force is best known for mediating nuclear decay. It has very short range, but is the only force (apart from gravity) to interact with neutrinos. The weak force is communicated via the W and Z exchange particles. Of these, the W-boson has either a positive or negative electric charge, and mediates neutrino absorption and emission by or with an electrically charged particle. During these processes, the W-boson induces electron or positron emission or absorption, or changing the flavour of a quark as well as its electrical charge. By contrast, the Z particle is electrically neutral, and exchange of a Z-boson leaves the interacting particles’ quantum numbers unaffected, except for a transfer of momentum, spin, and energy. Because exchange of W bosons involves a transfer of electric charge (as well as a transfer of weak interaction charge), it is known as “charged current”. By contrast, exchanges of Z bosons involve no transfer of electrical charge, so it is referred to as a “neutral current”. In the latter case, the word “current” has nothing to do with electricity - it simply refers to the Z bosons’ movement between other particles.

He is remembered most of all for his improvisation at the organ and for the renewal of Catholic liturgical music in the Netherlands. Andriessen composed in a musical idiom that revealed strong French influences. He was the brother of pianist and composer Willem Andriessen and the father of the composers Jurriaan Andriessen and Louis Andriessen and of the flautist Heleen Andriessen. Life and career Andriessen studied composition with Bernard Zweers and organ with at the Conservatory of Amsterdam. As the organist at Utrecht Cathedral, he became well known for his improvisation abilities . From 1926 to 1954, he lectured in composition and music theory at the Amsterdam Conservatory while also teaching at the Institute for Catholic Church Music in Utrecht between 1930 and 1949. He was the director of the Utrecht Conservatory from 1937 to 1949. During World War II, Andriessen refused to join the \\"Cultural House\\" (Kultuurkamer) and was thus barred from public functions by the Nazi occupiers. The only musical activities he was allowed were to give lessons and to accompany church services. He was held hostage by German occupiers from 13 July until 18 December 1942, when he was released . In 1949, he was appointed director of the Royal Conservatory in The Hague, a post he held until 1957. Between 1954 and 1962, he was appointed an Extraordinary Professor of Musicology at the Catholic University of Nijmegen. Andriessen's works included, besides eight masses, a setting of the Te Deum, four symphonies, variations for orchestra, lieder for voice and orchestra, chamber music, sonatas for cello and for piano, and works for solo organ.

He contributed to the success of dozens of musicals. Born in Kensington, London, he attended Winchester College before studying law at University College, Oxford. He began writing songs for shows at the age of 10 and had his first major success with \\"The Little Chinchilla\\" for the hit musical The Shop Girl when he was 19 years old. This was soon followed by songs for, among others, the hit musical San Toy. In 1899, he wrote songs for the international hit Florodora, which brought him wider fame. Producer George Edwardes hired him as an \\"additional material\\" writer for, among others, The Messenger Boy (1900), The Toreador (1901), A Country Girl (1902), The Girl from Kays (1902), The School Girl (1903), The Cingalee (1904) and The Blue Moon (1905), writing some of the most successful songs in these shows. He composed the hit musical Miss Hook of Holland (1907). Later compositions include The Balkan Princess (1910), The Sunshine Girl (1912), The Girl from Utah (1913), Tonight's the Night (1914), Betty (1915) and The Happy Day (1916). Rubens began a relationship with the actress Phyllis Dare during this period, but they soon parted due to Rubens' severe consumptive illness, from which he suffered for the rest of his life. As a result, he retired to Cornwall and died of tuberculosis, aged 41. Life and career Rubens was born in Kensington, London, the eldest son of a successful German-born Jewish stockbroker, Victor Rubens, and Jenny Rubens, née Wallach. Rubens attended Winchester College and then studied law at University College, Oxford from 1895 to 1897. Rubens had begun writing songs for shows as early as age 10, and he continued in music and dramatic societies throughout school.The Times obituary, 6 February 1917, p. 10 He intended, at first, to practise law, but he soon gave it up to write songs for the stage, including for a production of Alice in Wonderland, while still at Oxford, in which Lewis Carroll collaborated.Gänzl, Kurt \\"Rubens, Paul Alfred (1875–1917)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 18 September 2008, Early career Contemporary cartoon of Three Little Maids Rubens supplied lyrics and melodies for a number of successful musicals in the 1890s, beginning with \\"The Little Chinchilla\\" in the hit musical The Shop Girl (1894), sung by Ellaline Terriss at the Gaiety Theatre, London. Rubens was a talented melodist, but, lacking musical training, others had to supply the accompaniment for his songs. In the years that followed, he wrote songs for Arthur Roberts for Dandy Dan the Lifeguardsman (1898, \\"There's Just a Something Missing\\"); for Milord Sir Smith; for Little Miss Nobody (\\"Trixie of Upper Tooting\\", \\"A Wee Little Bit of a Thing Like That\\", \\"We'll Just Sit Out\\", and \\"The People All Come to See Us\\"); and for the hit musical San Toy (1899, \\"Me Gettee Outee Velly Quick\\") for producer George Edwardes. During the same year, he wrote the play Young Mr Yarde (1898, with Harold Ellis) and co-wrote a burlesque, Great Caesar (1899, with George Grossmith, Jr.), which was produced on the West End, but both were failures.\\"Paul Rubens\\", British Musical Theatre website of The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 21 August 2004 In 1899, he wrote songs for L'amour mouillé and the international hit, Florodora (1899: \\"Inkling\\", \\"Tact\\", \\"When I Leave Town\\", \\"I Want to Marry a Man\\", \\"When an Interfering Person\\", \\"Queen of the Philippine Islands\\", and \\"When We're on the Stage\\"), which brought him wider fame. Edwardes quickly hired Rubens as an \\"additional material\\" writer, and Rubens supplied some of the most successful numbers in The Messenger Boy in 1900 (\\"Tell Me Pretty Maiden\\", \\"How I Saw the CIV\\", and \\"A Perfectly Peaceful Person\\"); The Toreador in 1901 (\\"Everybody's Awfully Good to Me\\"); A Country Girl in 1902 (\\"Two Little Chicks\\" and \\"Coo\\"); The Girl from Kays in 1902 (\\"I Don't Care\\"); The School Girl in 1903; The Cingalee in 1904 (\\"Sloe Eyes\\", \\"Make a Fuss of Me\\", \\"She's All Right\\", '\\"You and I and I and You\\", \\"Golly-wogs\\", and \\"Somethings Devilish Wrong\\"); The Blue Moon in 1905; and The Dairymaids by Robert Courtneidge (1906). Sheet music from Betty During this period, Rubens also wrote incidental music for the 1901 production of Twelfth Night at His Majesty's Theatre. He also wrote songs for The Medal and the Maid (1902, 'Consequences') and The School Girl (1903). Edwardes gave Rubens the opportunity to write the book, lyrics and some of the music for Three Little Maids (1902), which had London and international success; Lady Madcap (1904, for which he wrote all of the music), which also had a long run; and Mr. Popple of Ippleton (1905), a more sophisticated piece than many of Rubens' earlier musical comedies, which was later produced in America as Nobody Home, with songs by Jerome Kern. Later years Grossmith and Dare in The Sunshine Girl, 1912 Frank Curzon then hired Rubens to write both the words and songs for musicals starring his wife, Isabel Jay (who had already starred in two of Rubens' shows), at the Prince of Wales Theatre, with exotic sets, elaborate costumes and a host of beautiful chorus girls. The first was Miss Hook of Holland in 1907, which turned out to be Rubens' most enduring success. Because of the progression of the consumptive illness from which he suffered most of his life, he needed the assistance of the director, Austen Hurgon, to finish the libretto. Rubens and Hurgon next wrote the disappointing My Mimosa Maid (1908) and the somewhat more successful Dear Little Denmark (1909). After writing songs that made their way into several Broadway shows, Rubens supplied songs for a number of mostly successful later shows, beginning with Curzon's The Balkan Princess in 1910 (an international hit, also starring Jay). He then returned to Edwardes' theatres, where the departure of Ivan Caryll gave him the chance to write the songs for The Sunshine Girl in 1912, The Girl from Utah in 1913, After the Girl in 1914, Tina and Betty, both in 1915, and The Happy Day in 1916. His best and most popular work from these years, however, is heard in his melodies and lyrics for Tonight's the Night (1914). After the outbreak of the First World War, Rubens wrote a successful recruiting song called \\"Your King and Country Want You\\". Vesta Tilley often performed the song.Duffy, Michael. \\"Vintage Audio: Your King and Country Want You\\", FirstWorldWar.com, 8 December 2002 Rubens' songs continued to be used at least into the 1920s. \\"The Gondola and the Girl\\" was part of the score of Irene Bordoni's 1924 production, Little Miss Bluebeard. Rubens met actress Phyllis Dare when she was cast in The Sunshine Girl, and he wrote a number of songs for her. They began a relationship and ultimately became engaged, but Rubens who had suffered severe ill-health through virtually his whole career, became too sick to marry, and so the couple separated. He retired to Cornwall and died in Falmouth, of tuberculosis, at the age of 41. Notes References Rubens, (right) with Hamish MacCunn (left) and Robert Courtneidge (centre), 1905 *Gänzl, Kurt.

This was the first portrait medal. The legend reads, in Greek: \\"John the Palaiologos, basileus and autokrator of the Romans\\". A medallist (British English) or medalist (American English) is an artist who designs medals, plaquettes, badges, coins and similar small works in relief in metal. Art medals are a well-known and highly collected form of small bronze sculpture, most often in bronze, and are considered a form of exonumia. \\"Medalist/medallist\\" is confusingly the same word used in sport and other areas (but not usually in military contexts) for the winner of a medal as an award. Medallists very often also design, or produce the dies for coins as well. In modern times medallists are mostly primarily sculptors of larger works, but in the past the number of medals and coins produced were sufficient to allow specialists who spent most of their career producing them. Medallists are also often confusingly referred to as \\"engravers\\" in reference works, referring to the \\"engraving\\" of dies, although this is often in fact not the technique used; however many also worked in engraving the technique in printmaking. Art medals have been produced since the late Renaissance period, and, after some classical precedents and Late Medieval revivals, the form was essentially invented by Pisanello, who is credited with the first portrait medal, which has remained a very popular type. He cast them like bronze sculptures, rather than minting them like coins. By nationality An incomplete list, biased towards the 19th-century onwards; see also :Medallists.

The ecosystems found within the park include rainforest, dry forest, shrublands and savanna. The mountains are home to around 50 known species of orchids, and botanists studying the area have identified more than 2,400 other species of plants. Of those, over 400 can also be found in the Orinoquía subregions. The plants in the Macarena have even less overlap with the 8,000 species in the Amazon subregions. The ecosystem's fauna includes anteaters, jaguars, cougars, deer, 8 species of monkeys, 500 species of birds including the gray-legged tinamou, 1,200 species of insects and 100 species of reptiles. Ecotourism The La Macarena National and Ecological Reserve Park is internationally known for the Caño Cristales, known by people who has visited it as one of the most beautiful rivers in the world. The park also contains petroglyphs from ancient cultures (Angosturas I and II petroglyphs in the Guayabero River). There are also enormous waterfalls, such as Caño Canoas, El Salto de Yarumales, El Salto del Mico, Soplaculos and others. Most of them are difficult to reach on foot due to the rugged terrain. Just outside of the city of La Macarena are the Botanical Gardens of La Macarena and the private reserve La Madrevieja de El Carmen, places that offer the possibility of nature tourism involving its visitors in restoration activities. Geology Caño Cristales Basement rocks on the east side of the Macarenas include the Precambrian granite of the Guyana Shield in the Guaviare River valley and the San Jose del Guaviare area. The rocks of the shield are overlain by sandstones and conglomerates of the Vaupes Formation of Lower Paleozoic to the lower Oligocene age.Pinson, W.

Lo, if half of the Israelites were clean and half unclean, the clean ones observe the first Passover and the\\" The Hebrew noun ṭum'ah, meaning \\"impurity\\", describes a state of ritual impurity. A person or object which contracts ṭumah is said to be ṭamé (טמא Hebrew adjective, \\"ritually impure\\"), and thereby unsuited for certain holy activities and uses (kedushah in Hebrew) until undergoing predefined purification actions that usually include the elapse of a specified time- period. The contrasting Hebrew noun ṭaharah () describes a state of ritual purity that qualifies the ṭahor (; ritually pure person or object) to be used for kedushah. The most common method of achieving ṭaharah is by the person or object being immersed in a mikveh (ritual bath). This concept is connected with ritual washing in Judaism, and both ritually impure and ritually pure states have parallels in ritual purification in other world religions. The laws of ṭumah and ṭaharah were generally followed by the Israelites, particularly during the First and Second Temple Period, and to a limited extent are a part of applicable halakha in modern times.  Etymology  The Hebrew noun ṭum'ah () derives from the verb ṭamé (), in the qal form of the verb \\"to become impure\\"; in the niphal to \\"defile oneself\\"; and in the transitive Piel to defile something or pronounce something impure.Brown Driver Briggs Hebrew Lexicon article ṭa'ama The verb stem has a corresponding adjective, ṭamé (טָמֵא), \\"impure\\". Likewise the Hebrew noun ṭahara () is also derived from a verb, in this case ṭaher () \\"to be ritually pure\\". and in the transitive piel \\"to purify\\". The verb and noun have a corresponding adjective, ṭahor (), \\"ritually pure\\". The word is a cognate to the Arabic word 'طهارة' ṭahāra(h) (pronounced almost identically, with the elongation of the second 'a') which has the same meaning in Islam. Some sources, such as Samson Raphael Hirsch on Genesis 7:2, claim that the meaning is \\"entombed\\", meaning the person or item that is in the tame state is blocked, and not in a state of receiving holy transmission. Ṭahor, by contrast, is defined as \\"pure\\" in the sense that the person or object is in a clear state and can/may potentially serve as a conduit for Divine and Godly manifestation. Although ṭumah and ṭaharah is sometimes translated as unclean and clean, it is more a spiritual state than a physical one. Once initiated (for the physical signs that initiate tzaraath, zav and niddah, see below) it is generally immeasurable and unquantifiable by known mechanical detection methods, there is no measure of filth, unsanitary, or odorous affiliation with the state of ṭumah, nor any mechanically measurable level of cleanliness, clarity, or physical purity for the state of ṭaharah.  In the Bible  Usage The noun form of ṭumah is used around 40 times in the Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible is generally translated as \\"uncleanness\\" in English language Bibles such as the KJV, and JPS Tanakh.Johnson M. Kimuhu Leviticus: The Priestly Laws and Prohibitions from the Perspective of Ancient Near East and Africa. 2008 Vol. 115 - Page 352 citing Helmer Ringgren in Bolterweck Theological Dictionary of the OT The majority of uses are in Leviticus. Though uses for national impurity occur in Ezra and Ezekiel, and Zechariah prophesies the removal of the \\"prophets and spirit of impurity () from the land\\".Michael Katz (Rabbi), Gershon Schwartz Searching for meaning in Midrash: lessons for everyday living 2002 Page 166 \\"This spirit is the spirit of impurity, as it is written, 'And I will also make the \\"prophets\\" and the unclean spirit vanish from the land' (). Water of purification is sprinkled upon him, and it flees.\\" The adjective tamei () \\"impure\\", is much more common. The verb form of ṭaharah (), the verb ṭaher () \\"be pure\\", is used first in the Hebrew Bible is in , where Jacob tells his family to \\"put away strange gods, and be pure\\". In general, the term tumah is used in two distinct ways in the Hebrew Bible:Malbim, HaTorah VeHaMitzvah, commentary on Vayikra 11:43, Vayikra 5:2-3David Tzvi Hoffman, introduction to Leviticus 11 (link); his term for \\"moral impurity\\" is . * Ritual impurity – the opposite of taharah (\\"purity\\"), also known as \\"impurity of the body\\". * Moral impurity – the opposite of kedushah (\\"sanctity\\"), also known as \\"impurity of the soul\\"; this category also includes activities which are disgusting or abominable. In general, tumah in the sense of \\"ritual impurity\\" is prefixed by the letter lamed or lacks any prefix at all, while tumah in the sense of \\"moral impurity\\" is prefixed by the letter bet. Ritual impurity =Activities which create impurity= The Torah, particularly the book of Leviticus, lists various activities which create an \\"impure\\" (tamei) status: * A person who touches a corpse becomes impure., * A person who touches something that has been made impure by a corpse becomes impure., , * A person who touches or carries carrion becomes impure. * A person who touches or shifts the carcass of one of the eight sheratzim. * A vessel or clay oven upon which falls one of eight dead creeping things becomes impure. * A woman, upon giving birth, becomes impure for 7 day for a son or 14 days for a daughter. * A person who has been diagnosed with tzaraat is impure. * A house which has been diagnosed with tzaraat is impure, as are its contents. * A man or woman with an unnatural emission from the genitals (zav/zavah), or a menstruating woman (niddah), are impure. A person who touches them, or who touches their chair, or vessels that they touch, is impure. * A man who has had a seminal discharge, or a garment touched by semen, is impure. * A person who eats meat of animals that have died of themselves or been killed by beasts becomes impure. * A priest who performs certain roles in the red heifer sacrifice becomes impure. * If a corpse is present in a house, people and objects within the house become impure. Some of these activities are forbidden (i.e. eating non-kosher meat), others are permitted (i.e. sex between a married couple),, and others are unavoidable (i.e. if a person dies suddenly while other people are in the house). Thus, there is no automatic moral stigma to becoming \\"impure\\". =Implications of impure status= Certain activities are prohibited as a result of acquiring this \\"impure\\" status. For example: * Before the giving of the Ten Commandments, the people were warned not to approach their wives (presumably due to semen causing impurity). * One who is impure due to tzaraat, genital emissions, or touching a corpse, had to live outside the desert encampment., * Priests could only eat sacrificial meat while pure. * One who is impure due to a corpse could not visit the sanctuary without making it spiritually impure, which is a crime punished by karet. Just as it is a severe offense to bring impurity into the Israelite sanctuary, \\"impurity\\" is also seen as a means of nullifying a worship site of other religions;; though the rules for this impurity are not made clear. =Becoming pure again= Different forms of impurity requires various rituals in order to regain a \\"pure\\" (tahor) status. For example: * Impurity due to seminal emission can be purified by immersing in a ritual bath after the next nightfall. * Impurity due to tzaraat requires waiting seven days, shaving one's hair, washing one's clothes, immersing one's body, and offering a Temple sacrifice to achieve purification. * Impurity from touching a corpse requires a special Red Heifer sacrifice and ritual to achieve purification. Moral impurity The term tumah is also used to refer to certain sins, for which there is no specific ritual to remove the impure status. For example: * Sexual sins such as incest, adultery, rape, bestiality; ; ; ; ,,, * Consulting the Ov or Yidoni * Delivering one's child to Moloch * Murder/manslaughter * Leaving a hanged criminal's corpse on the scaffold overnight * Idolatry, , ; * According to Malbim, the laws of kashrut fall in this category. In a number of cases, no specific sin is mentioned; overall sinful behavior has led to impurity.For example , , , =In Ezra–Nehemiah= Christine Hayes argues that moral impurity is the reason for the gentile expulsion and alienation that occurs in Ezra–Nehemiah.Hayes, C. (1999). Intermarriage and impurity in ancient Jewish sources. Harvard Theological Review, 92(01), 11. However, S.M. Olyan argues that Ezra and Nehemiah's attempt of the restoration of Israel to its original state was expressed through the expulsion and alienation of foreign peoples that was caused by both ritual and moral impurities. The Judean people believed that Israel and the priestly bloodline of Israel in itself was pure, being the chosen nation of their God. Furthermore, when the men of Israel committed to relations with Gentile people the acts took away from their purity. Olyan argues that there were different actions that were categorized by the Judean people as ritual impurity and moral impurity. Moral impurity can simply be removed, as in physical removal or separation between groups; thus expulsion of the Gentiles from the Judean environment was enough to re-purify the environment. However, ritual impurity is much more serious. Olyan argues that ritual impurity is deeply embedded into covenants, thus a religious ritual must be performed to rid the impurity from the people group.Olyan, S. M. (2004). Purity ideology in Ezra-Nehemiah as a tool to reconstitute the community. Journal for the Study of Judaism, 35(1), 1-16.  In rabbinic literature  The Mishnah devotes one of its six sub-divisions, named Tohorot (\\"purities\\"), to the laws of ritual impurity. Neither the Babylonian nor the Jerusalem Talmud contains systematic commentaries to the tractates of Tohorot (except for Niddah), as these laws had little practical relevance after the destruction of the Temple. However, the laws are discussed many times in other tractates, and in later rabbinic literature. Maimonides clarifies that, in addition to all of Israel, the priests are expected to be knowledgeable and fluent in the general and specifics of ṭumah and ṭaharah law. Given his role of Temple service and year round consumption of terumah, each priest was required to be in a ṭahor state.Maimonides, end of introduction to Seder Taharoth  Mandatory or optional  The mainstream view among rishonimR' Aharon Lichtenstein, Taharot: Basic concepts (1).

A niddah hut (Mergem Gogo) at the Jewish village of Ambober in northern Ethiopia, 1976. However, some rabbis have advocated keeping some of the laws of purity even in the absence of the temple in Jerusalem and even in the diaspora.Maimonides Chap. 13 of Tractate Nega'im. Meir Leibush ben Yehiel Michal, to Sifra on Leviticus 22:3 minor Chap. 66. b One category that was commonly kept in Talmudic and pre-Talmudic times is ṭumath ochlin v'mashkin (consuming food and drink that did not become ṭamei).Sefer ha-Chinuch chap. 160 Sages such as Rabban GamalielTosefta, Hagigah 3:3 - רַבָּן גַּמְלִיאֵל הָיָה אוֹכֵל עַל טַהֲרַת חֻלִּין כָּל יָמָיו and Hiyya the GreatJerusalem Talmud, Shabbat 1:3 page 8b: \\"רבי חייא רובא מפקד לרב: אין את יכול מיכול כל שתא חולין בטהרה אכול. ואם לאו תהא אכילת שבעה יומין מן שתא.\\" encouraged eating only pure food at all times. Targum Yonathan considered this to be implicit in .Targum Yonathan to Exodus 22:30 translated \\"You shall be holy men to me\\" as \\"You shall be holy men, tasting non-Temple food in purity, to me\\". One who kept this stringency was called a porush, meaning \\"separated\\" (from ṭumah).Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Tumat Ochlin 16:12 This was also one of the criteria for being a haver (a \\"friend\\" or \\"fellow\\" with whom the rabbis could eat without risk of violating purity laws),Tosefta, Damai 2:2 - המקבל עליו ארבעה דברים מקבלין אותו להיות חבר שלא ליתן תרומות ומעשרות לעם הארץ ושלא יעשה טהרות אצל עם הארץ ושיהא אוכל חולין בטהרה. and according to some, the main criterion.Encyclopedia Talmudit: Haver Additionally, some rabbis advocated abstaining from the midras of a niddah.Isaiah Horowitz vol. 1 p. 452; Menachem Recanati Pithkei Harakanti Chap. 586; Isaac Alfasi Teshuvath HaRif Chapter 297 Rabbi Menachem Schneerson discouraged abstaining from any object made impure by a menstruating woman in modern times, with the exception for unique individuals.Menachem Mendel Schneerson Igrot Kodesh vol. 3 p. 374 Hierarchy of impurity The rabbis describe a hierarchy of levels of impurity. In general, each level can result from touch by the level above it. The levels are: * Avi avot hatumah (grandfather of impurity) - a human corpse * Av HaTumah (father of impurity) - Maimonides enumerates 11 objects which have this status:Maimonides, commentary to the Mishnah, introduction to Taharot; see also Mishnah Kelim 1:1-4, Maimonides, Mishneh Torah Hilchot Avot HaTuma’ot 6:12 ** Tameh met - a living person who has touched a corpse ** Tumat sheretz - the dead body of a swarming animal (sheretz) listed in ** Tumat nevelah - the body of a land animal which died without ritual slaughter; the body of a non-kosher land animal which died in any manner; a kosher bird which died without ritual slaughter receives this status in relation to its consumption but not its touch ** Shichvat zera - human semen which has left the body ** Mei hatat - water into which ashes of the red heifer were mixed ** People who were involved in the red heifer procedure and in certain procedures of the Yom Kippur sacrifices ** Niddah - a menstruant woman; a man who has had sex with such a woman; the woman's blood, spit, and urine; objects which she has sat, reclined, or rode upon ** Yoledet - a woman in the period after she gives birth; the same related categories as with niddah ** Zavah - a woman with abnormal genital discharge; the same related categories as with niddah ** Zav - a man with abnormal genital discharge; his spit, urine, semen, and discharge; objects which he sat or rode [or reclined??] upon ** Metzora - a person who has contracted tzaraat, and in the purification period after recovery; a garment or house infected by tzaraat ** In addition, the rabbis declared several rabbinic categories of av hatumah. * Rishon letumah (first level of impurity) or vlad hatumah (child of impurity) - a person, vessels, food, or drink which have touched an av hatumah * Sheni letumah (second level of impurity): ** Food or drink which has touched a rishon letumah ** A person's hands are always considered sheni letumah, until he or she has done netilat yadayim.Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Avot HaTuma’ot 8:2 * Shlishi letumah (third level of impurity) - sanctified goods which have touched sheni letumah * Revii letumah (fourth level of impurity) - sanctified goods which have touched shlishi letumah * Hamishi letumah (fifth level of impurity) - According to Maimonides this status does not exist, and revii letumah cannot impurify other objects.Mishneh Torah Hilchot Shear Avot Hatumot 11:4 However, some sources suggest that this status might exist.Pesachim 18 In addition, red heifer waters can have a status similar to this. Impurity of scrolls The rabbis declared Torah scrolls to be impure by rabbinic law. This seemingly strange law had a practical purpose: it discouraged Jews from storing their terumah produce alongside Torah scrolls, which attracted mice and caused the Torah scrolls to be nibbled on as well.Shabbat 14a In modern times Following the destruction of the Second Temple, ritual impurity status ceased to have practical consequences, with the exception of niddah and zav/zavah. These rules are still practiced in Orthodox Judaism. In Conservative Judaism, while the concept of niddah and a prohibition on sexual relations during the niddah period (including childbirth) are still agreed upon, recent decisions by the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards have endorsed multiple views about the concept of zavah, as well as the tumah status of a niddah. The liberal view held that the concepts of ṭumah and ṭaharah are not relevant outside the context of a Holy Temple (as distinct from a synagogue; hence a niddah cannot convey ṭumah today), found the concept of zavah no longer applicable, and permitted spouses to touch each other in a manner similar to siblings during the niddah period (while retaining a prohibition on sexual conduct). The traditional view retained the applicability of the concepts of tumah, ṭaharah, and zavah, and retained a prohibition on all contact.

The geography of Sydney is characterised by its coastal location on a basin bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Blue Mountains to the west, the Hawkesbury River to the north and the Woronora Plateau to the south. Sydney lies on a submergent coastline on the east coast of New South Wales, where the ocean level has risen to flood deep river valleys (rias) carved in the Sydney sandstone. Port Jackson, better known as Sydney Harbour, is one such ria. The Sydney area lies on Triassic shales and sandstones. The region mostly consists of low rolling hills and wide valleys in a rain shadow area. Sydney sprawls over two major regions: the Cumberland Plain, a relatively flat region lying to the west of Sydney Harbour, and the Hornsby Plateau, a plateau north of the Harbour rising to 200 metres and dissected by steep valleys.Sydney Basin-Subregions Sydney's native plant species are predominantly eucalyptus trees, and its soils are usually red and yellow in texture. The endemic flora is home to a variety of bird, insect, reptile and mammal species, which are conspicuous in urban areas. There are more than 70 harbour and ocean beaches in the urban area. Most of Sydney's water storages are on tributaries of the Nepean River. Parramatta River drains a large area of Sydney's western suburbs. With 5,005,400 inhabitants (as of 2016) and an urban population density of 2037 people per square kilometre, Sydney's urban area covers , comprising 35% of Sydney and is constantly growing. Geology The Sydney region includes coastal features of cliffs, beaches, estuaries and deep river valleys known as rias. The rising sea level between 18,000 and 6,000 years ago flooded the rias to form estuaries and deep harbours. Erosion by coastal streams has created a landscape of deep canyons and remnant plateaus. The city has fault lines which run considerably deep beneath the Sydney basin, dating back to when New Zealand started breaking away from Australia more than 85 million years ago. To the east the basin continues to the edge of the continental shelf. The centre of the basin is located around west of the Sydney central business district at Fairfield. The sand that was to become the sandstone of today was washed from Broken Hill and laid down about 200 million years ago. The ripple marks from the ancient river that brought the grains of sand are distinctive and easily seen, telling geologists that the sand comes from rocks formed between 500 and 700 million years ago far to the south. This means that the highest part of the visible lines almost always faces approximately south. There are volcanic rocks from low hills in the shale landscapes. The Basin's sedimentary rocks have been subject to uplift with gentle folding and minor faulting during the formation of the Great Dividing Range. Virtually all of Sydney's exposed rocks are sandstone (Narrabeen Group of sedimentary rocks at Narrabeen). At a time in the past, monocline formed to the west of Sydney. The monocline is a sloping bend that raises the sandstone well above where it is expected to be seen, and this is why the whole of the visible top of the Blue Mountains is made of sandstone. Sandstone slopes in the Sydney area are on three sides: to the west the Blue Mountains, and to the north and south, the Hornsby and Woronora plateaux'. Being very porous, the Sydney sandstone has shale lenses and fossil riverbeds dotted throughout and it is some thick. The sandstone was probably deposited in a freshwater delta and is the caprock which controls the erosion and scarp retreat of the Illawarra escarpment. Six kilometres of sandstone and shale lie under Sydney. Bringelly Shale and Minchinbury Sandstone are often seen in the greater western parts of Sydney. Ashfield Shale is observed in the inner western suburbs. These components are part of the Wianamatta Shale group. Mittagong Formation sighted in a few areas in northern Sydney.Chris Herbert. Geology of the Sydney 1:100,000 Sheet 9130 Prospect Hill in western Sydney is the largest assemblage of igneous rock in Sydney. The oval-shaped ridge was made many millions of years ago when volcanic material from the Earth's upper mantle moved upwards and then sideways.Compton, K., Mindat: Prospect, New South Wales Slow erosion of the overlying layers of sedimentary rock by the flow of rainwater have eventually laid bare the edges of the volcanic and metamorphic rocks of the intrusion.Conybeare Morrison, Prospect Hill Conservation Management Plan, Holroyd City Council, 2005 The Gap, an ocean cliff on the South Head peninsula in Watsons Bay, was laid as sediment more than 200 million years ago in the Triassic period. During the Jurassic era, a cataclysmic event resulted in an enormous crack forming within the strata. The Gap itself forms a sequence that continues offshore to the edge of the Sahul Shelf. Sydney features two major soils; sandy soils (such as red, brown and yellow podsols, grey and brown tenosols, lithosols, kandosols and kurosols) which originate from the Hawkesbury sandstone and have low fertility, and clay soils (which are from shales and volcanic rocks), though some soils may be a mixture of the aforementioned soils (such as sandy clay loams and silty clay loam).Gray, J.M. & Murphy, B.W.

Rivers View of Nepean River from just south of Penrith. The Nepean River rises to the south in the Woronora Plateau, and wraps around the western edge of the city. Swamps and lagoons are existent on the floodplain of the Nepean River, one being Bents Basin, which is also a recreational area. Where the Nepean turns east it becomes the Hawkesbury River, which winds through the Hornsby Plateau before emptying into Broken Bay. Broken Bay and the lower Hawkesbury form the commonly accepted boundary between Sydney and the Central Coast to the north. The remaining section of Warragamba River flows north-east from the Warragamba Dam spillway to its confluence with the Nepean River. View of Georges River as it passes through East Hills and Voyager Point. The south and southwest of Sydney is drained by the Georges River, flowing north from its source near Appin, towards Liverpool and then turning east towards Botany Bay. The other major tributary of Botany Bay is the Cooks River, running through the inner-south western suburbs of Canterbury and Tempe. The Georges River estuary separates the main part of Sydney's urban area from the Sutherland Shire. The Woronora River, on the southern edge of the Sydney Plain, flows in a steep-sided valley from the Woronora Dam to the eastern estuary of the Georges River. The Hacking River is further south and runs through The Royal National Park into Port Hacking which forms the southern boundary of the Sutherland Shire. Parramatta River's headwaters are several local creeks including Toongabbie Creek and Hunts Creek, part of the upper Parramatta river catchment area. Hunt's creek flows from Lake Parramatta, a few kilometres North of Parramatta. At east Parramatta the river becomes a tidal estuary that flows into Port Jackson, commonly known as Sydney harbour. The reestablishment of foreshore mangroves has been a major focus of the ecological management of the Parramatta river and Sydney Harbour. Other major tributaries flow into Port Jackson from the North Shore and are the Lane Cove River and Middle Harbour Creek. Minor waterways draining Sydney's western suburbs include South Creek and Eastern Creek, flowing into the Hawkesbury, and Prospect Creek draining into the Georges River. Cowan Creek and Berowra Creek run north from the Upper North Shore to the Hawkesbury river. Sydney has a number of islands in its harbour and surrounding rivers. Such islands include, Shark Island, Cockatoo Island, Clark Island, Snapper Island, Spectacle Island and Goat Island in Port Jackson. Bare Island in Botany Bay. Lion Island, Long Island and Milson Island in Hawkesbury River. Scotland Island in the Northern Beaches. And Rodd Island in Parramatta River. Ecology North Shore and Northern Suburbs have lush, sclerophyll forest within residential areas, earning the region the nickname \\"The Leafy North Shore\\". The predominant plant communities in the Sydney region are grassy woodlands, which are open woodlands scattered with sclerophyllous shrubs and sparse grass in the understory. Wet and dry sclerophyll forest exist in some pockets, with heathlands and temperate/subtropical rainforests occurring in a few areas as well, thus making the Sydney region have distinct biomes. Dry sclerophyll forests, reminiscent of Mediterranean forests, are the most widespread forest type in the region, which occur sporadically in the Cumberland Plain and would feature dry, eucalyptus woodland. On the other hand, wet sclerophyll forests, which fall under temperate forests, have narrow, relatively tall, dense trees with a lush, moist understorey of fleecy shrubs and tree ferns. They are found in the cooler, wetter areas such as Northern Suburbs, Forest District, North Shore and in the Blue Mountains. Sclerophyll forests developed as a result of the extreme age of the continent combined with Aboriginal fire use. Deep weathering of the crust leached chemicals out of the rock, leaving Australian soils deficient in nutrients. The sandstone is the basis of the nutrient-poor soils found in Sydney that developed over millennia and 'came to nurture a brilliant and immensely diverse array of plants'. As plants cannot afford to lose leaves to herbivores when nutrients are scarce, they defend their foliage with toxins. In eucalypts, these toxins give the bush its distinctive smell. It has been calculated that around 98,000 hectares of native vegetation remains in the Sydney metropolitan area, about half of what is likely to have been existing at the time of European arrival.Benson D and Howell J 1990, Taken for granted: the bushland of Sydney and its suburbs. Kangaroo Press, Kenthurst, NSW. The fauna of the Sydney area is diverse and its urban area is home to variety of bird and insect species, and also a few bat, arachnid and amphibian species. Sydney is home to dozens of bird species, which mainly include the Australian white ibis, Australian raven, Australian magpie, crested pigeon, grey butcherbird, magpie lark, noisy miner, pied currawong, silver gull and willie wagtail, among others. Introduced birds such as the house sparrow, common myna and feral pigeon are ubiquitous in the CBD areas of Sydney.Hindwood, K. A. and McCill, A. R., 1958. The Birds of Sydney (Cumberland Plain) New South Wales. Roy. Zool. Soc. New South Wales. Moreover, possums, bandicoots, rabbits, feral cats, lizards, snakes and frogs may also be present in the urban environment, albeit seldom in city centers.Williams, J. et al. 2001.

Topography The Sydney CBD, with the Sydney Opera House and Sydney Harbour in view.Aerial view of Sydney The extensive area covered by urban Sydney is formally divided into more than 300 suburbs for addressing and postal purposes, and administered as 38 local government areas. The City of Sydney itself covers a fairly small area comprising the central business district and its neighbouring inner-city suburbs. The 151st meridian east passes through the western suburbs of Granville and Revesby, among others. The suburbs to the west of those lie on the eastern end of the 150th meridian, which is a line that passes through the Russian city of Magadan in the northern hemisphere. Sydney's central business district (CBD) extends southwards for about 2 kilometres (1.25 mi) from Sydney Cove, the point of the first European settlement. The west side is bounded by Darling Harbour, a popular tourist and nightlife precinct while Central station marks the southern end of the CBD. George Street serves as the Sydney CBD's main north- south thoroughfare.Spearitt, Peter, 2000, Sydney's Century: A History p. 122, Sydney: UNSW Press The oldest parts of the city are located in the flat areas south of the harbour; the North Shore was slower to develop because of its hilly topography, and was mostly a quiet backwater until the Sydney Harbour Bridge was opened in 1932, linking it to the rest of the city, with the suburbs surrounding the northern entrance to said bridge effectively developing North Sydney into a second central business district.Department of Local Government. Local Council Boundaries Sydney Outer (SO) Eastern suburb of Vaucluse, which is situated on a clifftop. The Eastern Suburbs sit on the coast of Sydney. They contain iconic beaches such as Bondi Beach and Coogee beach, and feature prominent seaside cliffs. The suburbs of Maroubra, Coogee and Bondi Junction lie on steep slopes, and would have an elevation of at the highest peaks. These suburbs are located in generally close proximity to the city centre and are serviced by rail networks. The landscape in these areas is characterized by winding crescent-like streets with harbourside beaches and villages. The Northern Suburbs of Sydney are characterised by pristine waterways with immense greenery and large plots of manicured land. Being around above sea level, the region is very hilly and has a higher elevation than the rest of Sydney. Most of the North Shore suburbs are part of the Hawkesbury Plateau, a large sandstone plateau overlaid by a system of hilly ridges and gullies. Major waterways in the region include the Parramatta River, Lane Cove River and the many creek systems that branch out from these. The region is home to many parks and nature reserves — The Lane Cove National Park and the Garigal National Park include many areas of remnant bushland adjacent to the Lane Cove River and Middle Harbour. Aerial view of Sydney's western suburbs surrounding Prospect reservoir (looking west of Cumberland Plain towards Blue Mountains). The Hills District, situated halfway between the northern suburbs and greater western Sydney, is a region so named for its characteristically comparatively hilly topography, akin to the Northern Suburbs and North Shore. Several of its suburbs have the word 'Hills' in their names. As the name indicates, the Hills District, depending on the suburb, is around above sea level. As such, its elevation creates orographic rainfall brought in by onshore winds from the Pacific Ocean. The western suburbs predominantly lie on the Cumberland Plain and are relatively flat in contrast to the above regions. They are situated on a rain shadow, thanks to the Hills District to the northeast. Thus, they tend to be drier than the coast and less lush than the hilly Northern Suburbs.Carter, Lewis, 2011. Tectonic Control of Cenozoic Deposition in the Cumberland Basin, Penrith/Hawkesbury Region, New South Wales. Bachelor of Science (Honours), School of Earth & Environmental Sciences, University of Wollongong. Despite being known as \\"flat\\", there are a number of ridgy areas on the plain — Western Sydney Parklands and Prospect Hill are between high. Highly elevated suburbs, which typically range between in height, include Leppington and Oran Park to the southwest, Pemulwuy, Cecil Hills and Horsley Park to the greater west, and Greystanes, Seven Hills and Mount Druitt to the northwest. Agriculture is mainly concentrated in the outskirts of the Greater Western Sydney area, such as in suburbs of Kemps Creek, Orchard Hills, Luddenham and Horsley Park, among others, which lie in a countryside. Recreational areas Mrs Macquarie's Point, in The Domain, shapes the northeastern tip of Farm Cove and provides panoramic views over the bay to the Opera House and the city skyline. The Sydney CBD contains prominent parks such as, Hyde Park, The Domain and Royal Botanic Gardens and Farm Cove on the harbour. Other parks in that vicinity include Wynyard and Hyde Park. The Royal Botanic Gardens is the most important green space in the Sydney region, hosting both scientific and leisure activities. There are 15 separate parks under the administration of the City of Sydney. The Royal National Park was proclaimed on 26 April 1879 and with is the second oldest national park in the world. The largest park in the Sydney metropolitan region is Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, established in 1894 with an area of . It is regarded for its well-preserved records of indigenous habitation and more than 800 rock engravings, cave drawings, and middens have been located in the park. The Domain is the oldest public parkland in Australia and measures in area. Its location was used for both relaxation and the grazing of animals from the earliest days of the colony. The inner west suburbs include Centennial Park and Moore Park in the east, Sydney Park and Royal National Park in the south, Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park in the north, and Western Sydney Parklands in the west. Other major parks in the Sydney metropolitan area include Auburn Botanical Gardens, Central Gardens Nature Reserve, Heathcote National Park, Georges River National Park, Lane Cove National Park and Blue Mountains National Park. There are large parks and reserves surrounding prominent bodies of water, such as those around Prospect Reservoir, Chipping Norton Lake, Lake Parramatta and Nepean River (Bents Basin). Sydney has some of the finest and most famous beaches in the world. There are well over 100 beaches in the city, ranging in size from a few feet to several kilometres, located along the city's Pacific Ocean coastline and its harbours, bays and rivers. With around 70 surf beaches and dozens of harbour coves, Sydney is almost unrivalled in the world for the number and quality of beaches available. The water and sand among the city beaches, despite their popularity, are remarkably clean. The beach watch program was established in 1989 in response to community concern about the impact of sewage pollution on human health and the environment at Sydney's ocean beaches. Regions Local government areas in Sydney. There are a number of informal regional names describing large sections of the urban area. Not all suburbs are necessarily covered by any of the following informal regional categories. The regions are Canterbury-Bankstown, the Eastern Suburbs, the Forest District, Greater Western Sydney, the Hills District, the Inner West, the Macarthur region, the Northern Beaches, the Northern Suburbs, the North Shore, Southern Sydney, South-western Sydney, the St George district, the Sutherland Shire and Western Sydney. The Blue Mountains are at times considered to be part of Sydney's metropolitan area. The largest commercial centres outside of the CBD are North Sydney and Chatswood in the north, Parramatta to the west, Liverpool in the south-west, Hurstville in the south, and Bondi Junction to the east. There has been accelerating commercial development in Parramatta since the 1950s as firms serving Western Sydney have set up regional offices and recognised the region's significant residential population mass and cheaper rents. Climate Thunderstorms and lightnings occasionally occur in the warm months. Sydney has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) with warm, sometimes hot summers, and winters shifting from mild to cool. Although Sydney is predominantly humid subtropical, the hilly wet areas in the North Shore, Northern Suburbs, Forest District and Hills District have an oceanic climate (Cfb). The weather is moderated by proximity to the ocean, and more extreme temperatures are recorded in the inland western suburbs. The warmest month in the CBD is January, with an average air temperature range at Observatory Hill of . The coldest month is July, with an average range of . In the west, the temperatures average between in summer. In winter, they're normally between . In late spring and summer, Sydney can sometimes get northwesterly winds from the Outback, which are dry and hot, making the temperatures reach above . Frost is oftentimes observed in the outer suburbs. Rainfall is spread throughout the year, but is slightly higher during the first half of the year when easterly winds dominate. Sydney's coast generally receives around to of rain annually. The western suburbs receive around to of precipitation, since moist onshore winds do not penetrate inland. Australian east coast low brings large amounts of rain in late autumn and winter.

The ballet became very popular and ran for nearly six months. Background In honour of the Jubilee, Alfred Maul, manager of the Alhambra Theatre, asked Sullivan to compose a patriotic ballet to a scenario by the theatre's resident choreographer, Coppi. As the nation's pre-eminent composer, Sullivan was the natural choice to write the music.Shepherd, Marc. \\"Victoria and Merrie England, ballet (1897), Gilbert & Sullivan Discography, 29 October 2001, accessed 2 October 2017 An alternate Jubilee composition, a poem submitted to Sullivan by the Poet Laureate, Alfred Austin, was never set. Sullivan composed the piece mostly on the French Riviera, combining the task with visits to the casino. Nevertheless, he took the commission seriously and produced one of his few successes in the decade of the 1890s. Victoria and Merrie England opened on 25 May 1897 and ran for six months at the Alhambra Theatre, which was a generous run for this kind of piece. Members of the British royal family were reported to have attended at least nineteen times. The orchestra was under the direction of the Alhambra's resident conductor Georges Jacobi.1897 theatre programme, Victoria and Merrie England, Alhambra Theatre Description of the ballet Although Sullivan's autograph manuscript does not survive, Roderick Spencer of the Sir Arthur Sullivan Society reconstructed the score from several sources, including earlier scores from which Sullivan drew, the piano reduction, and other clues that he gleaned from letters and news reports. Sullivan extracted three orchestral suites from the ballet, but only one of these survives. Sullivan's assistant, Wilfred Bendall, prepared the published piano reduction of the ballet.Howarth, Paul. Victoria and Merrie England, The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 10 November, 2011, accessed 2 October 2017 The ballet consists of a series of seven historical vignettes in praise of Britain, such as \\"Ancient Britain,\\" Christmas in the time of Charles II, and two scenes devoted to Queen Victoria. The score is a pot-pourri of characteristically English music. The staging too, was essentially British: the Sullivan scholar Selwyn Tillett writes of the Alhambra ballets that they had \\"little to do with the mainstream of classical ballet as it is understood today. Neither Swan Lake nor Sylvia was seen in London complete until the Dyagilev tour of 1911–12 ... cut off from the classical source, Alhambra ballet had developed in a unique direction of its own.\\" Tillett describes the Alhambra ballets as \\"mime-dramas\\" with many individual scenes and \\"speciality\\" dances.Tillett, Selwyn (1993). Notes to Marco Polo CD 8.223677 The work did not become part of the standard ballet repertoire. In the score, Sullivan re-used material from his Imperial March (1893) and his only other ballet, L'Ile Enchantée (1864). The final scene, after a depiction of Victoria's coronation, ends in a contemporary dance for soldiers from the various parts of Great Britain and its colonies and includes a counterpoint of characteristic tunes representing England, Scotland and Ireland, among which is Sullivan's own mock-patriotic \\"He is an Englishman\\", from H.M.S.

Settlers to the Oregon Territory planted grapes as early as the 1840s, however the production of wine has only been a significant industry in Oregon since the 1960s. Oregon wines first achieved significant critical notice in the late 1970s; in 2005, the industry sold 1.6 million cases of Oregon vintages with a retail value of US$184.7 million. In 2015, there were 702 wineries and 28,034 acres of vitis vinifera planted.  From settlement to Prohibition  298x298px Grapes were first planted in the Oregon Territory in 1847 by Henderson Luelling, a horticulturist who traveled to the territory on the Oregon Trail. Lisa Shara Hall, \\"History of the Oregon Wine Industry\\". Excerpt of: Lisa Shara Hall, Wines of the Pacific Northwest (Mitchell Beazley 2001), The first recorded winery, Valley View Vineyard, was established in Jacksonville (in what is now the Rogue Valley AVA) in the 1850s by Peter Britt, several years before the state was founded in 1859. In the first Oregon census in 1860, wine production was listed at 11,800 liters (2,600 gallons), though it is certain that not all of this came from grapes. In the 1880s, numerous immigrants to Southern Oregon experimented with various varietals, including Zinfandel, Riesling, and an unknown variety of Sauvignon. By 1899, Oregon vineyards yielded 2,694 tons of grapes. Five years later, a Forest Grove winemaker, Ernest Reuter, won a silver medal at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair The vineyard on which the grapes were grown was located on David Hill west of Forest Grove. Middle twentieth century Wine production in Oregon, like elsewhere in the United States, shut down during the Prohibition era, but resumed in 1933. The Oregon wine industry remained small for several decades, and was dominated by fruit wines (including wines based on grapes other than Vitis vinifera). By that time the California wine industry, with its warmer climate, had come to dominate wine production in the United States. Only two Oregon wineries produced wine using V. vinifera through the middle of the century, both on a rather small scale. Rebirth of an industry: The 1960s and 1970s David Lett of Eyrie VineyardsThe Oregon wine industry started to rebuild in the 1960s. Hillcrest Vineyard, established by UC Davis graduate Richard Sommer, opened near Roseburg in 1961 (in what is now the Umpqua Valley AVA), with the first vintage appearing for sale in 1964. Among the first varieties planted by Sommer in 1961 was the first Pinot noir in Oregon that was also the first commercially available Oregon Pinot noir with the 1967 vintage. Also in the 1960s, several winemakers started planting Pinot noir grapes in the Willamette Valley, including David Lett and Charles Coury. In 1966, Lett planted a vineyard in the hills outside of Dundee (Eyrie Vineyards). By 1970, the state had five bonded wineries, with in production.Chemeketa Community College: Northwest Viticultural Center: Oregon Wine Historical Milestones Many out-of-state winemakers, the bulk of them from California, began migrating to the state, including Dick Erath, Dick and Nancy Ponzi, Susan and Bill Sokol Blosser of Sokol Blosser Winery, David and Ginny Adelsheim, Pat and Joe Campbell, Jerry and Ann Preston, and Myron Redford. In 1973, Oregon passed its landmark land-use law, which imposed strict separation between agricultural and urban uses of land via such mechanisms as the Urban Growth Boundary and Exclusive Farm Use Zones. This prevented many hillsides, deemed inappropriate for other crops which are easier to grow on flat fields, from being converted to housing. Also in the 1970s, the winemakers of the region began to organize to promote their vintages. In 1977, the first coffee table book about Northwest wines, entitled Winemakers of the Pacific Northwest, was printed; the following year, a joint marketing brochure entitled \\"Discover Oregon Wines\\" was published. But it was events of 1979 that put the Oregon wine industry on the map. Eyrie Vineyards' 1975 South Block Pinot noir placed in the top 10 at the Gault-Millau French Wine Olympiades, and was rated the top Pinot noir, one of several non-European vintages to outplace French wines in the competition. Not only did the competition establish Oregon as a region capable of producing top-quality wines, it also established that premium winemaking was not the exclusive province of Europe, France in particular. French winemaker Robert Drouhin arranged for a rematch, pitting the Eyrie Pinot noir against a group of French wines considered to be finer than those in the Wine Olympics. The winner was Joseph Drouhin's Grand cru 1959 Chambolle-Musigny; the Eyrie came in a very close second. Matt Giraud, \\"Grape Expectations: The Birth of Oregon's Wine Industry\\", Willamette Week  Global recognition: The 1980s  Oregon winemakers continued to win awards in the 1980s. In 1980, there thirty-four bonded Oregon wineries, and 115 growers with planted. The 1980 vintage was greatly affected by the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, and two wines from that vintage won gold medals in the 1982 International Wine Competition in London. Ponzi Vineyards (then of Beaverton, now Sherwood) was favorably covered by the New York Times in 1981. In 1984, noted wine critic Robert M. Parker, Jr. visited Oregon and was highly impressed with the Pinots he encountered. Oregon Pinots won further acclaim in the 1985 Burgundy Challenge, wherein wine experts could not distinguish between Oregon and Burgundy Pinot noirs in a blind taste test; in the rankings, the Oregon wines were rated ahead of the Burgundy entrants. Also in 1985, the Oregon wine industry received its first mention in Wine Spectator. Nancy Ponzi, co-founder of Ponzi Vineyards, weaves grapevines around fruiting wires. The 1980s also saw continued efforts at marketing the Oregon wine industry. The Oregon Wine Advisory Board was established in 1983, and in 1984 the Willamette Valley AVA, Umpqua Valley AVA, Columbia Valley AVA, and Walla Walla Valley AVAs were established. In 1986, the International Pinot Noir Celebration was started at Linfield College in McMinnville, and in 1989, Willamette Valley Vineyards became the first publicly traded winery in the state. Greater ties between Oregon and Burgundy were established in the 1980s. Close ties were forged between horticulturalists at Oregon State University and notable French wine cultivation experts, such as Raymond Bernard at ONIVINS; this relationship gave Oregon vintners access to clones that California growers were not able to acquire. In 1987, the Drouhin family of Burgundy, one of France's highly regarded winemaking families, purchased in the North Willamette Valley, founding the Domaine Drouhin Oregon winery. In 1988, then-governor Neil Goldschmidt made an official visit to Burgundy.  Modern Oregon wine industry: 1990s and beyond  By 1990, there were 70 bonded Oregon wineries and 320 growers, with vineyard planted. The Oregon wine industry received a stern challenge from nature, when the Phylloxera root louse was discovered in Oregon. This necessitated the use of Phylloxera-resistant rootstocks, many vineyards took this as an opportunity to select different varieties of grapes more suited to their particular location. The Rogue Valley AVA was established; three years later, the Oregon Wine Marketing Coalition was founded. In 1995, the Oregon Legislature enacted several new laws which were beneficial to winemakers. Direct in-state wine shipments from wineries to customers were legalized, allowing Oregon winemakers to partially bypass wine wholesalers. In-store wine tasting was also legalized, as were certain off- site special events hosted by wineries. Oregon State University established a professorship in fermentation science. In 1998, the wine industry contributed US$120 million to the Oregon economy. A further legal change occurred in 1999, when legislation (HB 3429) was passed allowing multiple winery licensees on a single premise. This led to new winemaking arrangements, such as the Carlton Winemakers Studio and the SE Wine Collective. The 21st century has seen an emphasis on \\"green\\" wine production in Oregon. LIVE, an Oregon non-profit, certifies wineries for meeting certain environmental standards; over 320 vineyards and 41 wineries are now so certified. In 2002, Oregon became a leader in green winemaking with the Sokol-Blossor barrel room and the Carlton Winemakers Studio being LEED-certified by the U.S. Green Building Council. In 2006, the Stoller Vineyards winery was also LEED-certified. The Applegate Valley AVA was established in 2000; Yamhill-Carlton District AVA in 2004; Southern Oregon AVA in 2004; Columbia Gorge AVA in 2004; Dundee Hills AVA in 2005; McMinnville AVA in 2005; Red Hill Douglas County, Oregon AVA in 2005; Ribbon Ridge AVA in 2005; Eola-Amita Hills AVA in 2006; Chehalem Mountains AVA in 2006; Snake River Valley AVA in 2007; in 2003 the Oregon Wine Advisory Board (under the state Department of Agriculture) was replaced with the Oregon Wine Board, a semi-independent state agency. The Oregon Wine History Project began in 2010 at Linfield College in McMinnville, Oregon, under the auspices of the Linfield Center for the Northwest. The project maintains an extensive Oregon wine history archive. In 2012, Oregon Public Broadcasting aired the documentary Oregon Wine: Grapes of Place about the history of wine in Oregon produced in partnership with the Oregon Historical Society. Funding was provided by James F. & Marion L. Miller Foundation, Robert D. & Marcia H. Randall Fund for Lifelong Learning, Oregon Cultural Trust and Roundhouse Foundation. By 2015, Oregon had 702 wineries and 1052 vineyards with planted. References History of Oregon Oregon wine ","title":"History of Oregon wine"},{"id":"6469830","text":"The Arthur O.

He was the first president of the club from 1906 to 1910 and held various other posts with the club, including Honorary President. Shortly after completion of its transcontinental main line in 1885, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) built the nearby Glacier House in 1887 to serve as a restaurant and hotel for guests traveling on the line. The CPR imported Swiss guides to take hotel guests onto the nearby glaciers and up the mountains, and Glacier House became the birthplace of alpinism in North America. For the first quarter of the 20th century, it served as a centre of alpinism until it was closed in 1925 after the CPR Connaught Tunnel under Rogers Pass bypassed it. The foundation ruins of Glacier House can still be seen near Wheeler hut along the short rail trail that provides access to the hut in winter. The Alpine Club of Canada approved plans for an Alpine hut to serve as a substitute for Glacier House for alpinists in 1938, but construction did not commence until after World War II ended in 1945. Like Stanley Mitchell after which the Stanley Mitchell hut is named, A.O. Wheeler did not live to see completion of the hut named after him. He died in early 1945, while the hut was completed in 1947. Since its completion the hut has seen numerous upgrades and renovations, but remains rich in charm and history. Facilities The hut sleeps 30 in summer and 24 in winter. There are two wood stoves for heating and drying gear, and a kitchen with propane ranges and oven. There are propane-powered lamps in the kitchen and common areas.

It stars Betsy Russell, Leif Garrett, Lucinda Dickey, and Lorie Griffin. The film follows a troubled young woman who arrives at a cheerleader summer camp for a competition, where a series of murders begin to occur. Plot Cheerleader Alison is tormented by nightmares revolving an impending cheerleading competition. She arrives at a cheerleader camp to train with her teammates, where she rooms with the mascot, Cory, who is often ridiculed by the cheerleaders; Alison's boyfriend, Brent, immediately begins flirting with a blonde cheerleader named Suzy. The girls go to the river where they sunbathe, and are spied on by Tim, a member of Alison's cheering team. Also watching them is Sheriff Poucher, who gets interrupted by the camp handyman, Pop. The next morning, Alison finds Suzy in her cabin with her wrists cut, dead of an apparent suicide. The next day, Alison goes into the kitchen walk-in refrigerator in search of a drink and discovers Suzy's corpse on a shelf. The police are called, and Miss Tipton explains to Sheriff Poucher that, in order to protect her job, she didn't want to report Suzy's death until the program was finished. The Sheriff assures Tipton that he will take care of the matter, and the deal is sealed by the pair having sex, an act which is caught on video by Tim. As the result of a prank, the sex tape is broadcast the next day instead of a video of the camp's cheer routines. In the meantime, Brent has begun to flirt with teammate Pam, garnering Alison's concern. Alison has a nightmare in which she cheers along with a group of mascots as Brent has sex with Pam. At the river the next day, Brent and Pam leave to have sex. They argue, however, and he leaves Pam in the woods where she is murdered with garden shears by an unseen killer. That evening, Alison has a dream in which she kills Pam. The next day at the competition, Alison worries that she may have hurt Pam in a fit of rage and not remembered it. She mentions this to Cory who assures her that she slept through the night. On the day of the competition, Pam is nowhere to be found. Cory competes in the mascot dance contest, but is denied the win by Tipton. During the team's improvised routine, Tim falls offstage, knocking Pop to the ground in the process, prompting the handyman to declare, \\"I hope you die!\\" During the Camp Queen competition, Theresa, who has become increasingly worried about Pam, goes to find her. Cory and Brent follow separately into the woods to look for Pam and Theresa, and Miss Tipton sends Pop to search for her as well. Theresa finds Pam's body in the woods, and is chased down by a van before getting crushed against a tree. In the meantime, Alison and Bonnie compete for title of Queen, which Bonnie wins. Tim manages to impress a cheerleader from another team and takes her outside to have sex with her. He returns almost immediately with his hand covered in blood and reveals that he has found Theresa's body. Brent announces at the party that there is a killer on the loose, prompting the cheerleaders to panic and flee in their cars. Miss Tipton stumbles drunkenly into the woods to search for Pam, but she is soon hacked in the back by the killer. Alison, Cory, Bonnie, Tim, and Brent try to drive away, only to discover that their car has been tampered with, rendering it undriveable. The four hear gunshots in the woods, causing them to run separate directions; Alison returns to the van followed by Brent, Bonnie, and Cory, who claims someone attacked her in the woods. Brent retrieves Timmy's video camera in the woods, where they watch Timmy being killed on tape. The four set a booby trap using a bear trap in the tool shed, which inadvertently kills the Sheriff. They then encounter Pop, armed with a shotgun; Cory who believing Pop to be the killer, shoots him with a revolver. Back at the camp, Cory and Bonnie go to call the police, leaving Brent alone with Alison. He attempts to have sex with her, but she resists. Cory stumbles in, saying she can't find Bonnie; Brent goes to look for her and Cory tells Alison she thinks Brent may be the killer. Armed with the revolver, Cory sends Alison to shoot Brent. They find him standing over Bonnie's corpse and Alison shoots him. When the police arrive, they charge a distraught Allison with the murders. Cory supports this, claiming that Alison would have done anything to be number one. In the ambulance, Alison insists she only killed Brent, but the detective says that Cory blamed all the murders on her. Alison screams as she is taken away while Cory, dressed in a cheerleading uniform, cheers in front of the camp at dawn. Cast Production According to a Los Angeles Times article, the film was slated to be shot in Oregon in September 1987, though filming took place primarily at Camp Nelson and the Sequoia National Forest, as well as Bakersfield, California. The film was loosely based on the murder of Kirsten Costas in 1984.

It is an inhabitant of western and central Australia. Taxonomy Scientific name: Pseudantechinus macdonellensis. Common name: Fat-tailed-antechinus, fat-tailed pseudantechinus. It was first described in 1896 by Sir Walter Baldwin Spencer, who placed it in the genus Phascogale. It was for a long time included in the genus Antechinus. The species has formerly included the Alexandria false antechinus (P. mimulus), the Ningbing false antechinus (P. ningbing), and Woolley's false antechinus (P. woolleyae). The P. macdonellensis is commonly found in the rocky environments of Central Australia.http://www.publish.csiro.au/?act=view_file&file;_id=AM05227.pdf General facts A P. macdonellensis is a medium-sized dasyurid marsupial that ranges from 18-33 grams, and has a life span of about seven years. It is presumed to have a large population, and generally lives within the confines of protected areas. Therefore, it is unlikely to decline at the rate needed to be listed as an endangered species. The fat-tailed false antechinus is a member of the family Dasyuridae. Its species name, macdonnellensis, refers to the MacDonnell Ranges near Alice Springs, where it was first discovered. Description The fat-tailed false antechinus is 9.5-10.5 cm long with a 7.5-8.5 cm tail; it weighs 20-45g. It has a carrot-shaped tail swollen with fat which serves as a food reserve. Its fur is grey-brown. It has litters of up to six young, born in July–September (slightly later further west in the range). It is an insectivorous and nocturnal species. Habitat The P. macdonellensis is commonly found in the rocky environments of Central Australia. In addition it is found throughout South Australia, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. An outlying population in more coastal areas of Western Australia has been reclassified as a new species, Rory Cooper's false antechinus (P. roryi). The species inhabits rocky slopes and plains. Diet The P. macdonellensis is generally an insectivore whose diet consists of beetles, grasshoppers, and termites. A characteristic specific to this kind of species is its ability to store fat in its tail when food is plentiful. Torpor In the winter most free ranging P. macdonellensis go into a state of torpor after midnight within the confines of rock crevices, and stay there until day breaks. In the morning, while they are still torpid, they move from the rock-crevices to basking sites exposed to the sun. Subsequently, this type of basking continues for the rest of the day. It appears that daily torpor is done in order to reduce the amount of daily expenditure by about 30%, and allows the species to live and reproduce in a challenging environment. It has also been observed that the species goes into a state of torpor in circumstances in which the species finds itself under acute energetic stress. Gestation Males and females of the subdivision P. macdonellensis reach sexual maturity at about 350 days of age. A single gestation period takes about 43 days in the females, and produces a single litter of about six. The interval in between gestation periods is about 365 days.

The Numantine War was the third of the Celtiberian Wars and it broke out in 143 BC. A decade later, in 133 BC, the Roman general and hero of the Third Punic War, Scipio Aemilianus Africanus, subjugated Numantia, the chief Celtiberian city. Roman preparation In late 135 BC, the Roman Senate reappointed Scipio consul on popular demand and sent him to Hispania to finish what lesser generals had failed to complete. Scipio found morale low among the troops stationed in Iberia. The chance of plunder being low, there were few enticements to enlistment. Scipio nevertheless raised an army of 20,000 with 40,000 allied and mercenary troops, especially Numidian cavalry led by Jugurtha. The troops were trained hard by constant marching and there were several successful skirmishes before Scipio began to surround the city of Numantia itself. He planned only to starve it out and not to storm it. Siege works Scipio's army constructed two camps separated by a wall around the city (circumvallation). He dammed the nearby swamp to create a lake between the city walls and his own. From ten feet off the ground, his archers could shoot into Numantia from seven towers interspersed along the wall. He also built an outer wall to protect his camps (eventually five in total) from any relief forces (contravallation). Scipio also engineered the isolation of the city from the Duero. He towered the river at the points where it entered and exited the city and strung a cable across, with blades, to prevent both boats and swimmers from leaving or entering the city. Counterattack The Numantines attempted one failed sally before their greatest warrior, Rhetogenes, successfully led a small band of men down the river past the blockade. Heading first to the Arevaci, his pleas were ignored. He then went to Lutia, where he was positively received by the youth, but the elders of the tribe warned Scipio, who marched from Numantia and arrested the 400 Lutian youths and cut off their hands. After Scipio's return, Avarus, the Numantine leader, began negotiations. Surrender The first ambassadors sent by Numantia asked for their liberty in return for complete surrender, but Scipio refused. They were killed upon return by the incredulous populace, who believed they had cut a deal with the Romans. The city refused to surrender and starvation set in. Cannibalism ensued and eventually some began to commit suicide with their whole families. The remnant population finally surrendered only after setting their city on fire. Scipio took it and had its ruins levelled. This was late in the summer of 133. Legacy The siege of Numantia was recorded by several Roman historians that admired the sense of freedom of the ancient Iberians and acknowledged their fighting skills against the Roman legions. Miguel de Cervantes (author of Don Quixote) wrote a play about the event, La Numancia, which stands today as his most well-known dramatic work. More recently, Carlos Fuentes has written a short story about the event, \\"The Two Numantias\\", published in his 1994 collection The Orange Tree. In 2017, the Spanish authorities organized a commemoration of the 2150th anniversary of the siege. Conmemoración del 2150 aniversario del asedio de Numancia. Official site.

Thus, the two conflicts are sometimes called the Numantine Wars (plural) and subdivided into the First and Second Numantine War. The two are also called the Second and Third Celtiberian (or Spanish) Wars. (from Bellum Numantinum in Appian's Roman History) was the last conflict of the Celtiberian Wars fought by the Romans to subdue those people along the Ebro. It was a twenty-year conflict between the Celtiberian tribes of Hispania Citerior and the Roman government. It began in 154 BC as a revolt of the Celtiberians of Numantia on the Douro. The first phase of the war ended in 151, but in 143, war flared up again with a new insurrection in Numantia. The first war was fought contemporaneously with the Lusitanian War in Hispania Ulterior. The Lusitanians were subdued by Sulpicius Galba, who betrayed their surrender and executed their leading men, and the Arevaci of Hispania Citerior continued the war and allied with the Lusitanian leader Viriathus. After open war reignited in 143, Rome sent a series of generals to the Iberian peninsula to deal with the Numantines. In that year, Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus tried and failed to take Numantia by siege, but subjugated all the other tribes of the Arevaci. His successor, Quintus Pompeius, was inept and suffered severe defeats at their hands, so he secretly negotiated a peace with the city abiding by the previous treaty. Yet in 138 BC a new general arrived, Marcus Pompillius Laenas, and when the Numantine envoys came to finish their obligations of the peace treaty, Pompeius disavowed negotiating any such peace. The matter was referred to the Senate for a judgment. Rome decided to ignore Pompeius' peace and sent Gaius Hostilius Mancinus to continue the war in 136 BC. He assaulted the city and was repulsed several times before being routed and encircled, and so forced to accept a treaty, negotiated by a young Tiberius Gracchus. The Senate did not ratify this treaty either but only sent Mancinus to the Numantines as a prisoner. His successors Lucius Furius Philus and Gaius Calpurnius Piso avoided conflict with the Numantines. In 134 BC, the Consul Scipio Aemilianus was sent to Hispania Citerior to end the war. He recruited 20,000 men and 40,000 allies, including Numidian cavalry under Jugurtha. Scipio built a ring of seven fortresses around Numantia itself before beginning the siege proper. After suffering pestilence and famine, most of the surviving Numantines committed suicide rather than surrender to Rome. The decisive Roman victory over Numantia ushered in an era of lasting peace in Hispania until the Sertorian War over half a century later. This war also launched the careers of several important figures. Tiberius Gracchus was present as a quaestor during Mancinus's failed siege. Due to the reputation Gracchus's father had with the Numantines, Tiberius was selected to negotiate the treaty. Gaius Marius also fought in this war, as well as the later Roman enemy Jugurtha.

The war was fought on the Iberian Peninsula (called Hispania by the Romans) and was one of the Roman civil wars of the First Century BC. The Sertorians, a coalition of Iberians and Roman and Italian rebels, fought against the representatives of the regime established by Sulla. The war takes its name from Quintus Sertorius, the leader of the opposition. It was notable for Sertorius' successful use of guerrilla warfare. The war ended after Sertorius was assassinated by Marcus Perperna, who was then promptly defeated by Pompey.Dupuy and Dupuy, The Encyclopaedia of Military History, p. 93.  Origin of the war  During the Second Civil War, Quintus Sertorius fought for the Marian-Cinna faction against Sulla. In 83 BC, Sertorius, after falling out with his faction's leadership, was sent to the Iberian Peninsula as its governor. Unfortunately for Sertorius his faction lost the war in Italy and Sulla dispatched an army which drove him from Iberia. After some wandering Sertorius ended up at Tingis in North Africa; where he helped the locals dispose a pro-Sullan Tyrant. In Tingis he was met by an embassy of discontented Lusitanians, a fierce Iberian people, who implored him to lead them against the Sullan government who was extorting the back home. The Lusitanians chose Sertorius because of the mild policy he had pursued while governor in 82 BC.Philip Spann, Quintus Sertorius and the Legacy of Sulla, p. 54. The Lusitani had a long history of resistance to Rome.Spann, Quintus Sertorius, pp 58–9.

Berve, \\"Sertorius\\", Hermes 64 (1929) p. 221. Philip Spann considers this unlikely, as for Sertorius to accept such a treasonable offer would be to destroy any hope of returning to Rome. More likely the offer grew out of an acceptance by the Lusitani that they would not be able to defeat Rome and that their best hope was to assist the establishment in Rome of a regime sympathetic to them.Spann, Quintus Sertorius, pp 59–60. Spann suggests that a major reason for Sertorius' acceptance was that it was becoming clearer that there would be no amnesty for him and his followers nor reconciliation with the regime set up by Sulla.Spann, Quintus Sertorius, p. 55.  Sertorius returns to Iberia  In 80 BC Sertorius, after defeating a naval force under Aurelius Cotta, landed in the Iberian Peninsula at Baelo, near the Pillars of Hercules (Gibraltar).Spann, Quintus Sertorius, pp 56-57. Plutarch's account implies that Sertorius first went to Lusitania, organized the tribes and only then returned to the Baetis valley to defeat a Roman force under Fufidius (probably the governor of Hispania Ulterior). Spann suggests that a more probable sequence is that the battle of the Baetis River occurred during Sertorius' initial march to Lusitania.Spann, Quintus Sertorius, pp 57-58; Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p. 64. Events of 80-77 BC Sertorius‘ victory at the Baetis brought the majority of Hispania Ulterior back under his control. While he consolidated his power in the south-west (Ulterior) he sent his trusted lieutenant, Lucius Hirtuleius, to Hispania Citerior to take care of its governor, one Cotta, and the remaining Sullan forces on the Iberian Peninsula.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the struggle for Spain, pp 65-66. Concerned at the growing threat, the authorities in Rome upgraded Hispania Ulterior from a propraetorian to a proconsular province,Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p. 68. and appointed Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius, Sulla's consular partner of 80 BC, as its governor.H. H. Scullard, From the Gracchi to Nero,p. 90 In 79 BC, with Metellus on his way, M. Domitius Calvinus (who had taken over Hispania Citerior from Cotta) crossed over into Hispania Ulterior, he found his passage blocked by the army of Hirtuleius who had fortified Consabura. Hirtuleius used guerrilla warfare to wear down Domitius Calvinus’s army while he lured him inland. Eventually a battle was fought at the Anas River;Brennan, p. 505-506; Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the struggle for Spain, p. 80. where Domitius was defeated; he either died in battle or was killed by his own troops who defected to the rebels.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the struggle for Spain, p. 80; Plutarch, Life of Sertorius 12; Livy, Epitome 90; Eutropius, Summary of Roman History, VI.1; C. Konrad, Plutarch's Sertorius: A historical commentary. Metellus, unaware of the disaster, had already sent one of his legates, Lucius Thorius Balbus, to provide assistance to Domitius, but he too was defeated, this time by Sertorius himself. Calvinus's replacement as governor was Quintus Calidius.Brennan, pg. 506 Metellus entered Spain in late 80 or early 79 BC, basing himself at Metellinum (modern Medellin), made several thrusts into the interior, but was thwarted by Sertorius who used guerrilla tactics.Spann, Quintus Sertorius, pp 69-71. ::He [Metellus] was accustomed to regular warfare with heavy infantry. He liked to command a solid, ponderous bloc of infantry. This formation was superbly trained to push back and vanquish the enemy in combat at close quarters. For constantly chasing men who floated like the wind over mountains he had to climb, for enduring – as their enemy did – constant hunger without either tent or campfire, his army was useless. The light armour and consequent agility of his Iberian warriors meant Sertorius was constantly shifting the focus and changing the situation, until Metellus was at his wits' end. Metellus was no longer young, and after the many heroic contests of his youth he was now inclined to ease and luxury, while Sertorius was full of mature vigour. ... When Sertorius challenged Metellus to single combat, Metellus' men cheered and urged him to fight it out, general on general, and they mocked him when he declined.Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 12-13 passim. Lacking strong-points in central Hispania, Metellus set about creating them, he also started to methodically secure the cities and tribes of Hispania [this was the same strategy his father had used in the Jugurthine War when he had to fight king Jugurtha of Numidia who also used guerrilla tactics – Metellus had served on his father's staff back then].Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the struggle for Spain, p. 144 Some of these forts are known today – Metellinum (Medellin), Castra Caecilia (Cáceres), Viccus Caecilius and Caecilina. This strategy might have worked on an inferior opponent, but Sertorius kept up a relentless campaign of hit-and-run attacks and ambuscades slowly wearing down Metellus who was soon forced to call for help.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the struggle for Spain, pp 82-84; Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 13. Lucius Manlius, the governor of Gallia Transalpina, tried to come to Metellus's aid, he marched with three legions and 1,500 cavalry across the Pyrenees. He fought a battle with the forces of Lucius Hirtuleius near Ilerda where he was defeated and driven back into the city. After this setback, Manlius decided to retreat to his province. Hirtuleius tried to put Manlius under siege in Ilerda, but the governor of Gaul was able to escape. When he returned to Gaul where he was attacked by the Aquitani.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the struggle for Spain, pp 82-84; Orosius, Contra Paganos, 5.23; Sallust, Histories, 1.1113. In 78 BC Metellus tried to take Langobriga (probably Laccobriga near Lisbon), a town allied to Sertorius. Metellus intended it to be an object lesson; he wanted the Iberian towns to know Sertorius could not protect them. Forewarned Sertorius supplied and fortified the city and stripped the countryside around Langobriga of anything useful. Through these countermeasures Sertorius not only forced Metellus into besieging the city but also caused him to run out of supplies really quickly. Metellus had to detach a legion to go scouting for provisions. Upon their return they were ambushed by Sertorius who routed them and forced them to abandon their supplies. This left Metellus with noting to feed his army and he gave up the siege and marched back to the coast.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the struggle for Spain, pp 86-87. Back in Rome, Sulla died (78 BC) of natural causes leaving his faction without a strong leader.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the struggle for Spain, p. 87. In 77 BC Metellus adopted a more cautious strategy, only holding on to the line of the Beatis River while he awaited the events in Rome where a new revolt loomed. Sertorius left Metellus to his devices and concentrated on subduing those tribes in the interior that had not yet yielded to his authority. Events of 76-74 BC The ongoing Sertorian threat forced the government in Rome into taking drastic measures; they agreed that the new governor of Hispania Citerior should get a proconsular command and that he should be sent out with a sizeable army to support Metellus's struggle against Sertorius and his rebels. In 76 BC the Senate accepted a proposal by Lucius Marcius Philippus to send his son-in-law Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (Pompey), who had never been a magistrate, on behalf of the consuls (both of whom had refused the command themselves). Pompey recruited an army of 30,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry, its size evidence of the seriousness of the threat presented by Sertorius, and marched to Hispania.John Leach, Pompey the Great, pp 44-45. In the same year (76 BC) Sertorius was joined by Marcus Perpenna, who brought the remnant of the army of rebellious consul Marcus Aemilius Lepidus from Sardinia. However, Perperna had only reluctantly agreed to put himself under Sertorius's command; he had sailed his army to Liguria and was raising troops from among the Ligurians and Gauls there, when his men heard that Pompey was marching north to deal with them, they demanded that Perpenna take them to Hispania and join up with Sertorius.Spann, Quintus Sertorius, p. 86Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 15. Perpenna brought a substantial force of fifty-three cohorts (almost five-and-a-half legions) with him to Spain. Thus reinforced Sertorius decided to take on the eastern cities who supported the Sullan faction. His first target was the city of Lauron between Valentia and Saguntum.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p. 96; John Leach, Pompey the Great, p. 47; Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 18.3; Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 18. Meanwhile, Pompey had crossed the Pyrenees and was marching his army toward Sertorius, he intended to finish the rebelion in one stroke by trying to force Sertorius into a pitched battle and defeating him. Pompey also sent a fleet under his brother-in-law, Gaius Memmius, accompanied by the able Spaniard Balbus, to try and take New Carthage, secure it as a base, and from there move up the coast. Memmius was immediately blockaded in the city, probably by Sertorius's pirate allies, and was unable to play his part in the campaign.John Leach, Pompey the Great, p.45. The Battle of Lauron Pompey had a veteran army (recruited from among his own and Sulla's veterans) of 30,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalryJohn Leach, Pompey the Great, p. 44. The size of the army clearly indicates the seriousness of the Sertorian threat. at his back and must have been very confident for he immediately took the offensive; Upon entering Hispania he started clearing the coastal strip from the Pyrenees to New Carthage in order to link up with Metellus who was in Hispania Ulterior.John Leach, Pompey the Great, p. 47. Initially successful he suffered a major setback when he faced Sertorius at the city of Lauron.Frontinus, Stratagems, 2.5.31; Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 18.3; Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 18; John Leach, Pompey the Great, pp 226-227; Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 96-101; Scullard, Gracchi to Nero, p. 91. Sertorius arrived at Lauron first, and began to lay siege to the city. Pompey was very confident of victory and when he arrived he built his camp close to that of Sertorius to force Sertorius into battle.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p. 97. Sertorius decided to teach Pompey a lesson. ::Pompey, was delighted with the way things had turned out, for he now positioned his army so that Sertroius was, as he believed, caught between the city and the army. So Pompey sent a messenger to the people of Lauron. He invited them to celebrate, and take their seats along the city wall to see how Sertroius enjoyed being besieged. Sertorius was told of this, and found it highly amusing. Sulla's pupil (as he jokingly liked to refer to Pompey) was due another lesson – this time from Sertorius himself.Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 18. Sertorius responded by sending out his light troops and cavalry to harass Pompey's foragers. He ordered his men to concentrate on the forage parties in the nearby areas but to leave the Pompeians in the more distant tracts alone. Eventually, tired of the continual raids, the Pompeians moved their foraging operations to the more remote areas. This was what Sertorius had been waiting for; During the night he ordered ten cohorts of heavily armed troops and ten cohorts of light troops under the command of Octavius Gracinus, along with Tarquitius Priscus and two thousand cavalry to move out of his camp and lay an ambush against the foragers.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the struggle for Spain, pp. 96-105. The Battle of Lauron was a brilliant tactical victory for the Sertorians and proved the war was far from over. Unfortunately for Sertorius, Metellus fought his way past Perpenna who was trying to keep him from interfering and came to Pompey's rescue. The battles of Valentia and Italica At the start of the campaigning season of 75 BC Pompey defeated Sertorius's legates, Perpenna and Herennius, in a battle near Valentia. Perperna and Herrenius made the mistake of giving battle, apparently they were under the impression they could defeat the young general in a pitched battle. They fought in the narrow space which separated the river from the city walls, conditions which favoured the battle hardened veterans of their opponent. Herennius himself was among the 10,000 casualties. Valentia was taken and sacked. Sertorius who was campaigning against Metellus had to rush east to recover the situation and left Hirtuleius in command in Hispania Ulterior.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 117-118; John Leach, Pompey the Great, p.48; Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 18. Metellus promptly defeated Hirtuleius in a battle near the Roman colony of Italica. Hirtuleius mustered his army soon after dawn and marched on Metellus's encampment. Metellus also mustered his troops, but kept them behind his entrenchments until noon. It was extremely hot and Hirtuleius' troops were soon sweltering while Metellus' legionaries remained relatively fresh.Frontinus, Stratagems, 2.1.2. Since his enemy remained drawn up in front of his camp for hours, Metellus had plenty of time to study their dispositions and make his own plans accordingly.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p.119. He had observed that Hirtuleius had posted his strongest units in the centre of his battle line. When the battle finally commenced Metellus held back his own centre and concentrated on winning on the flanks. After defeating his opponents flanks he enveloped Hirtuleius centre.Frontinus, Stratagems, 2.3.5. Hirtuleius lost 20,000 men at Italica and, chastened, he fled north to join his commander Sertorius who was squaring off against Pompey. Metellus followed wanting to make the most of his victory by trapping Sertorius between Pompey and himself.John Leach, Pompey the Great, p.47; Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 118-119; Livy, Epitome, 91.4; Frontinus, Stratagems, 2.1.2 and 2.3.5. The battles of Sucro and Saguntum Upon hearing of Hirtuleius's defeat and the loss of his army at Italica, Sertorius decided he had to defeat Pompey before Metellus would arrived from the west. Pompey, for whatever reason, decided to comply and both men drew up their armies for battle. They fought a pitched battle at the River Sucro; and although Sertorius defeated the left wing of Pompey's army (even forcing Pompey himself to flee the battlefield) his other wing was defeated by Pompey's legate Afranius, so the end result was a draw.Spann, Quintus Sertorius, pp 111–112. When word came of Metellus's immanent arrival, Sertorius marched inland with Pompey and Metellus in pursuit. At a town called Saguntum (probably not the city of Saguntum but a town with a similar name - see the discussion about its location in the Battle of Saguntum main article) Sertorius' own forces, fed up with Sertorius' guerrilla tactics, forced Sertorius into battle.Spann, Quintus Sertorius, p. 114; Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 21. The battle ended inconclusive, but Sertorius suffered severe losses and was forced to withdraw further inland. Rebuilding the army Sertorius marched to the fortress town of Clunia in Celtiberia drawing Metellus and Pompey with him.Spann, Quintus Sertorius, pp 113–115; Livy, Epitome, 92. At Clunia Sertorius resisted a siege tying up Pompey and Metellus while elsewhere his agents were rebuilding his army. When they were ready, Sertorius extricated his force from Clunia and joined up with the rest of his army.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 132-133; Frontinus, Stratagems, 2.12.2. The 74 BC campaigns The war during the year 74 BC is poorly documented. During the winter Metellus, who was wintering in Gaul, received two legions in reinforcementsPhilip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p. 143 When the campaigning season started he marched across the Pyrenees and joined Pompey. They concentrated their efforts on the lands of the Celtiberians and the Vaccaei.Spann, Quintus Sertorius, pp 124–5 Overall, however, it seems that Sertorius' position was somewhat eroded.Spann, Quintus Sertorius, pp 127 According to Frontinus Metellus even got lucky during that particular year. ::Metellus wanted to keep his troops in order so he had announced he had intelligence of an enemy ambush. He ordered that no- one should break ranks and leave the standards. He only did this to keep his troops disciplined, yet it he happened to meet with an actual ambush. His soldiers dealt with it calmly, since they we expecting it.Frontinus, Stratagems, 4.7.42 Pompey had less luck when he tried to take Palentia. He was besieging the city when Sertorius turned up. Pompey did not stay to fight, but retreated before Sertorius could engage. From that moment on Pompey operated more closely to Metellus, each remaining close enough to support the other should the need arise. Perperna circumvented the Romans operating in the interior and marched to the Iberian westcoast where he took the city of Cale.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p. 146. After rebuilding the walls of Palentia Sertorius suddenly marched east into the Ebro valley. He surprised the Romans besieging the fortress town of Calgurris, killing some 3000 of them.Matyszak, Sertorius, pp 146-147. The Senate sent an admiral called Antonius with a fleet to wage a naval campaign against Sertorius' naval and coastal forces. Antonius tried to raise the siege of Emporion,Sertorian forces had taken Emporion out of the conflict by a close siege. but made little progress against the stalwart Sertorian besiegers. Eventually, Antonius was recalled as his fleet was needed elsewhere.Matyszak, Sertorius, pp 147-148; Sallust, Histories, 3.6-7. At the end of the campaigning season of 74 BC Pompey took his army into the Roman Province in southern Gaul where the local governor, Fronteius, had laid on stores for Pompey and his forces. Pompey used the winter to write urgent letters to his followers and the Senate in Rome. The letter to the Senate has been preserved in the works of Sallust. ::From my early youth I have endured peril and privation whilst the armies under my command put to flight the most criminal of your enemies and made you safe. Yet, Fathers of the Senate, now that I am absent, you could do no more against me than you are now doing if I had spent my time fighting you, my fatherland and my father's gods. For now, despite my youth, you have left me exposed in the cruellest of wars. You have, to the best of your ability, condemned both me and a faithful army to that most wretched of deaths, that of starvation. Is this what the Roman people expected when they sent their sons to war? And after being wounded, and so often shedding their blood for their country, is this how they are rewarded? When I got tired of fruitlessly writing letters and sending envoys, I usd up my personal resources, and even my credit, while in three years you have barely supplied me with enough to keep going for one. By the Immortal Gods! What do you think I am – the treasury, or someone capable of running an army with neither food nor pay? I'll admit that I started this war with more zeal than discretion. Forty days after you gave me the empty title of general I had raised an army. The enemy [i.e. Perperna] were already at the throat of Italy, and I drove them from the Alps into Hispania, in the process opening for you a route far superior to Hannibal's. ... Outnumbered and with inexperienced troops I held off the first onslaught of the conquering Sertorius. Thereafter I spent the winter not in making myself popular or in the towns but in camp among the most savage of enemies. Do I really have to recount the battles and campaigns, the towns destroyed or captured? The matter speaks for itself; the taking of the enemy camp at Sucro, the fight on the River Turia, Gaius Herennius, the enemy commander, wiped out along with his army; Valentia; you know all this well enough. So, grateful fathers, in return for all this – we get want and hunger. They are in the same condition, the enemy army and mine. Neither has any pay, and both can march into Italy to get it. Take note of this and please give my warning your full attention – you do not want me to take into my own hands the job of providing myself with what I need. Those parts of Hispania Citerior not held by the enemy are actually a costly burden for us because apart from the coastal towns both we and Sertorius have devastated it into total destitution. Gaul supplied cash and crops to Metellus last year – this year the crops failed and the province can barely support itself. So I'm out of options, money and credit. It is up to you. Either you save the situation or my army will come to Italy and bring the war with it. It's not what I want, but you have been warned.Sallust, Histories, 2.82. Pompey's threat galvanised Rome's aristocrats, and since the State was lacking the funds, they started a fund-raising campaign. The Sertorian threat frightened Rome's elite and many decided to contribute from their private fortunes.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 149-151; Sallust, Histories, 2.82. Events of 73-71 BC During 73 BC there was a growing division between the Roman and Iberian elements of the Sertorian coalition.Spann, Quintus Sertorius, p. 128 Metellus had offered a reward of one hundred silver talents and twenty-thousand acres of land to any Roman who would betray Sertorius.John Leach, Pompey the Great, p. 51; Philip Matyszak, Sertorius, p. 152; Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 22. This resulted in Sertorius no longer trusting his Roman bodyguard and he exchanged it for a Spanish one causing resentment among the Romans and Italians in the Sertorian camp who saw this as a sign that their commander did not trust them anymore.John Leach, Pompey the Great, p. 51. Now a group of Romans began to actively plot his downfall. Plutarch tells how the Romans meted out harsh treatment to the Iberians, blaming their actions on Sertorius' orders thus undermining his popularity.Plutarch, Lives, Sertorius, 25, University of Chicago They wanted to get rid of Sertorius, who was becoming more and more erratic and paranoid. It is normally assumed that Perperna made his move to assassinate Sertorius in 72 BC.Scullard, From the Gracchi to Nero, p. 92 However there are strong arguments in favor of 73 BC. Perperna proceeded to invite Sertorius to a feast to celebrate a supposed victory. While under most circumstances, any festivities to which Sertorius was invited were conducted with great propriety, this particular feast was vulgar, designed to offend the skillful general. Disgusted, Sertorius changed his posture on the couch, intent on ignoring them all. At this, Perperna gave the signal to his fellow conspirators, and they murdered the unsuspecting Sertorius on the spot.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 153-154. Upon learning of the death of Sertorius, some of his Iberian allies sent ambassadors to Pompey or to Metellus and made peace, most simply went home. Perperna managed to retain control of some of the Roman renegades who had followed Sertorius, but he needed a quick victory to gain his people's trust. Unfortunately for Perperna and his men, Pompey had set a trap; he feigned a retreat and ambushed them. Frontinus reports: ::Pompey put troops here and there, in places where they could attack from ambush. Then, pretending fear, he pulled back drawing the enemy after him. Then, when he had the enemy exposed to the ambuscade, he wheeled his army about. He attacked, slaughtering the enemy to his front and on both flanksFrontinus, Stratagems, 2.5.32. Pompey lured Perperna's army into his ambush using 10 cohorts as bait. He allowed these to be attacked while scattered over a wide area, perhaps foraging, and as they fled they drew Perperna's army into the hidden lines of the main army. As these attacked from ambush, the 10 cohorts turned and attacked their pursuers from the front. The ensuing massacre was decisive.John Leach, Pompey Great, p.52. Pompey's successful ambush proved Plutarch's disparaging comment 'Perperna was as bad at command as he was at following orders'. Perperna attempted to plead for his life, offering to give Pompey all of Sertorius' correspondence, which would document contacts with the highest levels of Roman government and society. Pompey indicated he would accept the papers, and when they had all been gathered together, he burned them, averting the possibility of another civil war. He then executed Perperna and all of the men who had murdered Sertorius.Spann, Quintus Sertorius, p. 135 Aftermath In the view of Scullard, Pompey's treatment of Hispania was humane, relative to the normal Roman treatment for traitors and rebels. Citizenship was given to many supporters and a group of fanatical opponents were resettled to Lugdunum Convenarum in southern Gaul.

If a tetrahedron has a right-angle corner (like the corner of a cube), then the square of the area of the face opposite the right-angle corner is the sum of the squares of the areas of the other three faces. : A_{ABC}^2 = A_{\\\\color {blue} ABO}^2+A_{\\\\color {green} ACO}^2+A_{\\\\color {red} BCO}^2 Generalizations The Pythagorean theorem and de Gua's theorem are special cases (n = 2, 3) of a general theorem about n-simplices with a right- angle corner. This, in turn, is a special case of a yet more general theorem by Donald R. Conant and William A. Beyer, which can be stated as follows. Let U be a measurable subset of a k-dimensional affine subspace of \\\\mathbb{R}^n (so k \\\\le n). For any subset I \\\\subseteq \\\\\\\\{ 1, \\\\ldots, n \\\\\\\\} with exactly k elements, let U_I be the orthogonal projection of U onto the linear span of e_{i_1}, \\\\ldots, e_{i_k}, where I = \\\\\\\\{i_1, \\\\ldots, i_k\\\\\\\\} and e_1, \\\\ldots, e_n is the standard basis for \\\\mathbb{R}^n. Then :\\\\mbox{vol}_k^2(U) = \\\\sum_I \\\\mbox{vol}_k^2(U_I), where \\\\mbox{vol}_k(U) is the k-dimensional volume of U and the sum is over all subsets I \\\\subseteq \\\\\\\\{ 1, \\\\ldots, n \\\\\\\\} with exactly k elements. De Gua's theorem and its generalisation (above) to n-simplices with right-angle corners correspond to the special case where k = n−1 and U is an (n−1)-simplex in \\\\mathbb{R}^n with vertices on the co-ordinate axes. For example, suppose n = 3, k = 2 and U is the triangle \\\\triangle ABC in \\\\mathbb{R}^3 with vertices A, B and C lying on the x_1-, x_2 and x_3-axes, respectively. The subsets I of \\\\\\\\{ 1, 2, 3 \\\\\\\\} with exactly 2 elements are \\\\\\\\{ 2,3 \\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\{ 1,3 \\\\\\\\} and \\\\\\\\{ 1,2 \\\\\\\\}. By definition, U_{\\\\\\\\{ 2,3 \\\\\\\\}} is the orthogonal projection of U = \\\\triangle ABC onto the x_2 x_3-plane, so U_{\\\\\\\\{ 2,3 \\\\\\\\}} is the triangle \\\\triangle OBC with vertices O, B and C, where O is the origin of \\\\mathbb{R}^3. Similarly, U_{\\\\\\\\{ 1,3 \\\\\\\\}} = \\\\triangle AOC and U_{\\\\\\\\{ 1,2 \\\\\\\\}} = \\\\triangle ABO, so the Conant–Beyer theorem says :\\\\mbox{vol}_2^2(\\\\triangle ABC) = \\\\mbox{vol}_2^2(\\\\triangle OBC) + \\\\mbox{vol}_2^2(\\\\triangle AOC) + \\\\mbox{vol}_2^2(\\\\triangle ABO), which is de Gua's theorem. The generalisation of de Gua's theorem to n-simplices with right-angle corners can also be obtained as a special case from the Cayley–Menger determinant formula . History Jean Paul de Gua de Malves (1713-85) published the theorem in 1783, but around the same time a slightly more general version was published by another French mathematician, Charles de Tinseau d'Amondans (1746-1818), as well. However the theorem had also been known much earlier to Johann Faulhaber (1580-1635) and René Descartes (1596-1650).Howard Whitley Eves: Great Moments in Mathematics (before 1650).

The judgement ensured equal rights for Syrian Christian women with their male siblings in their ancestral property. Until then, her Syrian Christian community followed the provisions of the Travancore Succession Act of 1916 and the Cochin Succession Act, 1921, while elsewhere in India the same community followed the Indian Succession Act of 1925. Mary Roy was denied her share of the familial property due to the Travancore Succession Act of 1916. She sued her brothers after her father's death. This was the case that made its way through the Indian court system and which she won. She is the founder-director of Pallikoodam school (formerly Corpus Christi High School) at Kalathilpady, a suburb of Kottayam town in the state of Kerala. Her daughter is the Man Booker Prize winner Arundhati Roy  Court case  The women of Mary Roy's Syrian Christian community could not inherit property because of the Travancore Succession Act of 1916. Contending this, Mary Roy filed the case against George Isaac, her brother, after the demise of her father P.V. Isaac in 1960. She sued her brother to gain equal access to the inheritance left to them. The lower court at first rejected her plea. The property was divided into two parts - the Kottayam property which was spread over two locales and another at Nattakom grama panchayat. The case was considered a landmark case for the reason it fought for equal property rights for Syrian Christian women. Mary Roy approached the Kerala High Court in 1994 to get the lower court's judgement overruled. She was successful. After her mother's death in 2000, she approached the Kottayam Sub-court for the final decree. The case continued for 8 years after which she filed the execution petition in 2009, and she finally received the property.  Personal life  Mary Roy was the daughter of P.V. Isaac, an entomologist who trained in England under Harold Maxwell-Lefroy and became Imperial Entomologist at Pusa. In a personal interview with the Times of India Mary disclosed personal details about her life. She admitted to having a complicated relationship with her elder brother George, whom she sued, and mentioned the separation from her husband. The God of Small Things written by Arundhati Roy has a character Ammu which was based on her mother Mary Roy. Mary confirmed she was very similar to the character her daughter wrote, however she was never involved with a man of lower caste - as was the case in the book. In the interview she details that Arundhati declared independence from her mother and both had a strained relationship for that particular period. However, she declared she was proud of Arundhati's accomplishments and did not expect that she would win the Man Booker Prize.

His focuses include cognitive and social processes in language use; interactive processes in conversation, from low-level disfluencies through acts of speaking and understanding to the emergence of discourse; and word meaning and word use. Clark is known for his theory of \\"common ground\\": individuals engaged in conversation must share knowledge in order to be understood and have a meaningful conversation (Clark, 1985). Together with Deanna Wilkes-Gibbs (1986), he also developed the collaborative model, a theory for explaining how people in conversation coordinate with one another to determine definite references. Clark's books include Semantics and Comprehension, Psychology and Language: An Introduction to Psycholinguistics, Arenas of Language Use and Using Language. Education and academic career Clark, born in 1940, attended Stanford University until 1962 and received a B.A. with distinction. He attended Johns Hopkins University for post-graduate training, where he obtained his MA and his PhD, in 1964 and in 1966 respectively. The same year he finished his PhD, he completed his post-doctoral studies at the Linguistics Institute of UCLA. He has since worked at Carnegie-Mellon University, Stanford University. Scientific career Semantics and pragmatics Clark's early work explored theories of comprehension. He found that people interpret verb phrases, particularly eponymous verb phrases, against a hierarchy of information presumed to be common knowledge between the listener and the speaker. This hierarchy of beliefs is composed of # The identity of the eponym, # Acts by the eponym, # Relevant acts of the eponym, and # The type of act being referred to. For example, when a person instructed, “Do a Napoleon for the camera,” the listener would identify Napoleon, recognize acts that were done by Napoleon (such as smiling, saying ‘fromage’, or posing for paintings), and then use the context to identify the act being referred to (tucking one's hand into one's jacket.) Listeners would begin at level 1 with the broadest constraint and then, with each new constraint at levels 2, 3, and 4, find it easier to identify what the speaker intended as the relevant act. Listeners would proceed on a context-centered (the situation and what would be the appropriate act) or eponym-centered (the eponym what would be a relevant act) basis to get to the right meaning. Out of the requests “Please do a George Conklin for the camera,” and “Please do a Napoleon for the camera,” it would be hardest to progress past level 1 for George Conklin, presuming one may not even know who he is, and easiest to progress to level 4 for Napoleon, since of the known acts associated with him relevant ones come to mind easily. Another important finding by Clark was that salience is necessary for two people to understand exactly what is being referred to. Napoleon did eat and sleep during his lifetime, but saying, “Do a Napoleon at the kitchen table,” to mean “eat” would create comprehension problems, because the salience of the act is limited. Irony In his study of irony, Clark examined the pretense theory, which states that two speakers in a conversation do not announce the pretense they make when speaking with irony, but do nevertheless expect the listener to see through it. Thus, common ground must be had by both speakers in order for the effect of irony to work. Irony contains three important features: asymmetry of affect, victims of irony, and ironic tone of voice. Asymmetry of affect speaks to the higher likelihood of making ironic positive statements (“What a smart idea!” to a bad idea) than ironic negative statements (“What a stupid idea!” to a good one). Since those who are ignorant of irony would be more likely to cling to the general tendency of seeing the world in terms of success and excellence, these are the people that ironists pretend to be. Victims of irony are the people in conversation presumed not to understand the irony, such as the person that the speaker is pretending to be, or the person that could be the listener who wouldn't understand the irony in the speech. The ironic tone of voice is the voice a speaker takes on in lieu of his own in order to fully convey the pretense. Ironic tones of voices tend to be exaggerated and caricatured, like taking on a heavily conspiratorial voice when discussing a widely known piece of gossip. The Mention Theory of irony states that sentences or phrases that are used in ironic speech are not being used, but are rather being mentioned. An example of this would be a person taking on the pretense of being a weatherman on the local news and saying, “What lovely weather it is! Rain, rain, and rain,” with an exaggerated enthusiastic voice and not explicit statement of whom she's referencing. The speaker would not be using a sentence, in this case, but rather she would be mentioning what she has heard the weatherman say before. Taking on the pretense of an oblivious weatherman and saying, “What lovely weather it is!” when it is storming and dark outside is making mention of a phrase previously said by weathermen and expressing contempt toward it. Speech acts One of Clark's better-known studies was on how to make requests that overcome an obstacle to compliance. In making requests, speakers analyze the greatest potential obstacle they see to getting the information that they want, and frame their requests in a way that overcomes them in the easiest manner possible. They can frame the request in 3 different ways: to design an indirect request conditional on the absence or elimination of the obstacle, to make broadly applicable conditional requests, or to approach an obstacle sideways. For example, if a speaker wants to know the time of the concert he is attending with his friend, he knows his friend may not remember. He will therefore make an indirect request conditional on the elimination of the obstacle and ask, “Do you remember what time the concert is tonight?” which will mean “Do you remember what time the concert is, and can you tell me?” Therefore, if the friend does not remember, he can simply answer “no.” The second way is illustrated in more frequent and general situations where the obstacle isn't well known or specific. So if the speaker were to ask a passing stranger near the arena about the start time of the concert, he might formulate, “Can you tell me when the concert starts?” The expected obstacle is formed by lack of ability and willingness of the stranger to answer the question. It is a useful convention due to how it provides the stranger with a broad range of graceful excuses not to give the desired answer. The last way of framing to overcome obstacles is for situations where the person being addressed seems unwilling to provide the information. Then the speaker can ask for related information that the addressee is willing to divulge, and the speaker appears polite while the addressee is not being forced to admit unwillingness. Whether the obstacle is being addressed directly or sidestepped, the speaker is still designing requests that best overcome the greatest expected obstacle. Referring as a collaborative process In conversation, in order to establish common ground and make referencing known concepts or objects easier, speakers work together to establish definite references. Unlike the literary model of definite reference, which takes into account only what the speaker does to create the definite reference; the conversational model has the speaker and the listener working together. The listener is interpreting at the same time as the speaker is talking, and the speaker may have to edit to rephrase what is being said based on how the listener reacts. Speaker A and speaker B must mutually accept the functionality and usefulness of A's reference before they can allow the conversation to go on. The belief that both have accepted the reference is established through a two-part process: (a)presentation and (b)acceptance. Speaker A presents a reference (e.g. the dog with the pink collar) and Speaker B accepts it by responding with the affirmation that he understood which dog was discussed. If A realizes the presentation wasn't definitive enough, he may edit his speech to be more specific (e.g. the dog with the pink collar, near the tree, by the parking lot over there). If B doesn't accept the presentation (e.g. the dog with the what? that's not a dog, that's a weasel), then A has to reissue the reference. Completing the acceptance process may take several exchanges between the speakers. Clark later developed his theory on discourse and how each speaker, or contributor, takes part in it with his or her partners. The most important element of common ground in discourse, he found, was the mutual understanding of each utterance by all partners. If speaker A makes an utterance that he believes will create common ground with speaker B but speaker B misheard it or misunderstood it, no progress on common ground has been made. A contribution can be made in two ways: collectively and individually. Both A and B adding what A said to their common ground is a collective act. A contributing and B registering the contribution are two distinctive individual acts. Therefore, discourse does not progress until both collectively and individually the discourse partners have accepted new references and established them as common ground. If A assumes the contribution was successful and adds what he said to the common ground he may continue to build upon what he believes was established, but B has not registered the contribution correctly, then they'll have to start over until all three steps are satisfied. One assumption of this model is the principle of least collaborative effort: participants in a contribution try to minimize the total effort spent on that contribution, both in the presentation and acceptance phases. The fewer exchanges between A and B to clarify references, the more successfully the common ground is being built. Common ground and grounding Clark began his work in common ground with studying the references in conversation between experts and novices. To develop references in discourse, speakers try to establish the mutual belief that all speakers understand the references to a criterion that is sufficient for the purpose of continuing the discourse. In a conversation between a physician and his patient, for example, the doctor may request, “Contract your deltoid,” making reference to a technical term that the patient may not know. If the patient doesn't know, he will ask, “My deltoid?” and the doctor will clarify, “Raise your right arm.” If the patient does know the reference, he will comply immediately. Throughout these exchanges, speakers supply and acquire expertise. Clark test summarized the process into 3 stages: assessing (directly or in passing finding out the expertise level of the discourse partner), supplying (experts who are addressing novices can expand their contribution to explain the reference), and acquiring expertise (novices speaking to experts acquire knowledge and fill in the gaps during conversation). Perspective is also important to the conversations between experts and novices; as experts gain more expertise their understanding of the topic becomes more broad and abstract, taking on organization that novices cannot follow. When explaining certain concepts to novices, experts also have to take on the perspectives of novices to make the most effective references. In a different study, Clark showed how coordinating beliefs in conversation shapes the effectiveness of references. When speaker A and speaker B are conversing, the references they use build common ground and allow them to make shorter inferences upon repeated use. So while the first reference may be “the dog with the pink leash next to the birch tree,” the second reference may become “the dog near the birch tree”, and the third may be “the birch tree dog”. But when a conversation partner C only listens to the conversation between A and B and doesn't participate, the references made earlier (although he heard all of them) are not as efficient when C switches places with B. As a matter of fact, he is treated like a novice in the conversation, despite having heard A and B use the references previously. Thus speakers redevelop common ground with new partners and create new references that both were presented with and accepted. Most recently Clark studied how speakers monitor their addresses for understanding when giving directions, making references, or developing common ground. In a study where subjects used Legos to build copies of a prototype, subjects were divided into builders and those who were instructing the building. Some were able to see each other clearly as well as each other's workspaces, while others’ views were obstructed in some way. The pairs of partners who could clearly see each other and the instructing and the building that was happening had more success with their process than the pairs who could not see each other. The ability to see the builder's workspace enabled the instructor to nod, point, and otherwise aid the builder in precise and efficient ways. Those who couldn't see the workspace made more errors, due to lack of affirmation by the instructor and the inability to check how successfully they were following directions. Lastly, those who listened to the instructions from an audiotape without an instructor present were even less efficient with their building. This finding demonstrated how a conversation is a collaborative process, and that speakers and listeners work together to achieve a common goal. The ability to interact to maintain common ground throughout discourse or any communicational process allows for both parties to feel like they're keeping up. Addressees and overhearers Similarly to the Lego study, Clark examined the differences in understanding and compliance between addressees and overhearers. In an experiment where one person told another person how to arrange 12 complex figures and a third person listened in, and all began the conversation as strangers with equal background information. Nevertheless, addressees were more accurate at following the directions and arranging the figures than the overhearers even though they heard exactly the same things. From this, Clark concluded that the social process of interacting in conversation plays a central role in the cognitive process of understanding. If hearing the same words were enough to understand the directions, addresses and overhearers would have performed similarly. Since they did not, there is cause to conclude that understanding is part of a collaborative process. The process of grounding in a conversation happens at the point where both A and B find a perspective they can agree on. If C, the overhearer, understands this perspective then he keeps up; if he does not, then he is left behind. Since he's an overhearer, his understanding does not affect whether A and B continue on, and while they continue to build common ground for the remainder of the conversation, C is not following or understanding them. Disfluencies and strategies in speaking Clark worked with Jean E. Fox Tree to study the pronunciation of ‘the’ and ‘thee’ and their use in signaling problems while speaking. What they found was that the shorter pronunciation of ‘the’, phonetically thuh, was used far less frequently to show a problem in speech production. Only 7% of thuhs were followed by a suspension of speech due to articulation errors, word retrieval, or choice of message consideration. However, the longer pronunciation, thiy, was used 81% of the time to signal an immediate oncoming pause. Thiy was frequently followed by a pause and reformulation of speech and could also foreshadow the use of thuh before speech resumed its regular pace. 20% of the time thiy is used, speakers can repair the problem in time and continue without further disruption, but 80% of the time they deal with the problem by pausing, repeating the article, repairing what they were about to say, or abandoning the original plans for speech altogether. A similar study by the same researchers examined ‘uh’ and ‘um’ in spontaneous speaking. Like thiy and thuh, um and uh signal varying degrees of delay, which um creating a major pause and uh creating a minor one. Because of how they are incorporated into speech, such as specifically put to use at certain pauses in speech, attached as clitics onto other words, and prolonged for additional meaning, they have become a part of spontaneous speech that have meaning. What they argued was that um and uh are conventional English words and speakers plan for them, formulate them, and produce them just like any other vocabulary. Joint actions Conversations as joint projects were where Clark explored vertical and horizontal transitions prompted by dialogue. A horizontal transition, for example, would be speaker A beginning a stage of a conversation about a car he and speaker B saw. Until speaker B understands the car being referenced, the exchange will be horizontal within the same joint project of understanding the reference. Once B recognizes the reference and the car is no longer the joint action of the speakers, they have made a vertical transition in dialogue. Clark proposed that m-hm, uh-huh, yeah, yes, and yep are all horizontal markers that do not interrupt the flow of the joint activity. They are used as continuers and display to the speaker that the listener is following the exchange and the speaker still has the floor. As long as horizontal markers are used, they are allowing the current speaker to continue with their action. Once the speaker's action is interrupted with side projects, such as clarifying what model car is being discussed or where it was seen, a vertical transition was made and is completed once the original speaker has the floor again. A digression by speaker can cause a vertical transition as well: by the way and as a matter of fact, and exits from the transition are prompted by anyway and so. Some words, like okay are universally used for a variety of transitions, like digression, vertical transition, and horizontal transition. Speakers understand and use these markers seamlessly and precisely in conversation to coordinate joint actions and maintain common ground for future direct reference.

After the phenomenal success of Cellier and Stephenson's Dorothy (1886), the pair were hoping for another big hit. Doris turned out to be only modestly successful. It opened at the Lyric Theatre in London on 20 April 1889 and ran for 202 performances and was produced, like Dorothy, by Henry J. Leslie. It starred Arthur Williams, Ben Davies, Alice Barnett, Hayden Coffin, Furneaux Cook and John Le Hay. The title character was first played by opera and concert singer Annette Albu (1858–1927), a fine singer, but she was not a great comic actress and not considered pretty; after two months, with the show already flagging, Leslie replaced her with his star from Dorothy, Marie Tempest.Gänzl, Kurt. \\"When a girl isn't pretty ... but she can sing!\\", Kurt of Gerolstein, 4 May 2019, accessed 3 April 2020 The New York Times review stated: :\\"Musically considered, the new comic opera is an English classic.... The composer does not descend at any time from his ideal plane. There is [no] sacrifice of artistic form at any point to please the popular ear.

What judicious compression and unscrupulous 'gagging' may accomplish one cannot, of course, venture to prophesy. I understood that at the end of Dorothy's run very little if any of the original dialogue remained. It had been improved out of recognition. Still, both Dorothy and Falka rejoiced in plain straightforward stories everyone could understand.

He loves Anne Jerningham, one of the Queen's maids of honor. At a picnic given by her father, Alderman Shelton, Doris playfully runs away from Martin, her father's chief apprentice, and with whom she is in love. Attempting to hide in a hollow tree, she finds Sir Philip, already concealed there. She takes pity on him and convinces Martin and two friends to aid his escape. Dinniver, a comical wicked servant, hides behind a bush, overhears the plan and tells the Alderman about it. While the Alderman goes for the authorities, Dinniver is forced to exchange clothing with Philip, and so Dinniver is arrested in Philip's place. Philip escapes. ;Act II Philip is posing as an apprentice to the Alderman, but he is betrayed by Martin. After drawing the wrong conclusion from a letter, Martin has become jealous of Philip and Doris. When Martin realises that his jealousy is unfounded, he remorsefully dons the fugitive's original clothes and is arrested in his place.

The success of the expedition, which marked the first overseas deployment of the Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy, revealed the fragility of the Qing dynasty's hold on Taiwan and encouraged further Japanese adventurism. Diplomatically, Japan's embroilment with China in 1874 was eventually resolved by a British arbitration under which Qing China agreed to compensate Japan for property damage. Some ambiguous wording in the agreed terms were later argued by Japan to be confirmation of Chinese renunciation of suzerainty over the Ryukyu Islands, paving the way for de facto Japanese incorporation of Ryukyu in 1879. Background In December 1871 a Ryukyuan vessel was shipwrecked near the southern tip of Taiwan. Fifty-four members of its crew of 66 were beheaded by the Paiwan aborigines. The remaining 12 crewmen were rescued by Han Chinese and were transferred to Tainan in southern Taiwan. The local Qing Chinese government officials transferred them to Fujian province in mainland China. From there, the Qing government arranged to send them back home. Diplomacy When Japan sought compensation from Qing China, the court rejected the demand on the grounds that Taiwan's \\"raw\\" or \\"wild\\" natives () were outside its jurisdiction. This open renunciation of sovereignty led to the Taiwan Expedition of 1874 by the Japanese. The Meiji government of Japan demanded that the Qing government of China punish leaders of the Taiwanese aborigines responsible for the murders of the Ryukyuan crew. The Japanese foreign minister Soejima Taneomi went to Beijing in June 1873, and was received in an audience by the Tongzhi Emperor (in itself a diplomatic triumph); however, his request for compensation was first rejected because China considered it an internal affair since Taiwan was part of Fujian Province of China and the Ryūkyū Kingdom had a tributary relationship with China. When Soejima Taneomi claimed four of the victims murdered were from Oda Prefecture, present-day Okayama Prefecture, Japan and asked for compensation again, Chinese officials refused him on the grounds that most of the Taiwanese aboriginals were outside effective Chinese control, and were thus sometimes exempt from judicial action. Charles Le Gendre, the French-born American military advisor to the Japanese government, as well as Gustave Emile Boissonade, legal advisor, urged that Japan take the matter into its own hands. Two Americans, James Wasson, a Union Army veteran, and Douglas Cassel, a Union Navy veteran who was also a Lieutenant Commander during the 1871 US expedition to Korea, were employed by the Japanese as foreign advisors. Given that both men were Ohio Natives, former Ohio Congressman and peace advocate John Bingham publicly protested their involvement, fearing they would violate American neutrality.Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States, December 7, 1874 (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1874), pp. 675–77 Expedition Ryūjō was the flagship of the Taiwan expedition. The battle of Stone Gate, against the \\"Botan\\" aborigines, was the most serious encounter of the expedition. Marquis Saigo Tsugumichi commanded Japanese expeditionary forces as a lieutenant-general in the Taiwan Expedition . On May 6 the Japanese government landed a small force commanded by Douglas Cassel to select a campsite fortified by the sea. Four days later, more Japanese troops landed, and on May 15 Cassel acted as a negotiator to Chief Issa, head of the Island's sixteen southern tribes. Chief Issa stated the \\"Botans\\" were out of his control, and gave the Japanese his consent to punish them as they wished.James R. Wasson, untitled expedition report, Tokyo, 1875, pp. 8–29, Le Gendre Papers, LCCunningham p. 6 After this, a pig was killed and a feast was had, where Japanese Officers presented Snider rifles for three friendly chiefs while Cassel and Wasson showed off the capacity of a Winchester rifle to astonished aborigines.House pp. 66–67 On May 17 a one-hundred man party went inland to scout for another camp location, and from this party a dozen split off to investigate a village. Despite being within friendly territory, this small group was ambushed by the Botans. In the ensuing skirmish one Japanese soldier was wounded in the neck and a Sergeant from Satsuma killed. The small Japanese group retreated back to the main force, and upon returning found the Sergeant had been decapitated by the aborigines, his head taken as a trophy.House p. 68Eskildsen, Robert. An Army as Good and Efficient as Any in the World: James Wasson and Japan's 1874 Expedition to Taiwan (Asian Cultural Studies 36, 2010), p. 55 On May 18 the Japanese ship Nisshin commanded by Akamatsu Noriyoshi anchored in Kwaliang bay and launched a small boat to conduct surveys. Aborigines from the village Koalut fired upon the boat with muskets. Despite receiving no injuries, Akamatsu was enraged at the incident and made immediate plans not only for attack on Koalut, but the nearby village of Lingluan as well. These plans would be postponed and eventually cancelled.House p. 69 On May 21 a detachment of twelve men was sent out to investigate the area where the Satsuma Sergeant had been killed. During this investigation the detachment was ambushed again by a group of fifty natives and in the exchange of fire two Japanese were seriously wounded and one attacker was killed. The Japanese returned hastily to the shore and sounded the alarm, and 250 men accompanied by Wasson marched inland to respond. Wasson was dismayed at the lack of discipline of the Japanese soldiers, particularly in the rear, who quickly broke rank and dashed ahead in a race to get to combat first. The natives retreated after the arrival of the main force.House pp.71–72Eskildsen, Robert. An Army as Good and Efficient as Any in the World: James Wasson and Japan's 1874 Expedition to Taiwan (Asian Cultural Studies 36, 2010), pp. 56–57 Saigō arrived with more troops on May 22. Consequently, Colonel Sakuma Samata commanding a 150-strong force marched too far inland and was ambushed by 70 natives, commencing the Battle of Stone Gate. The aborigines were already in pre-selected ambush positions behind stone, while the Japanese had to make do with what cover they could find from rocks seated in the waist-deep river and only being able to employ 30 troops at one time due to the terrain. Early in the engagement Sakuma ordered a retreat, but was completely ignored by his troops who continued to fight. The fighting lasted a little over an hour, until Sakuma ordered 20 riflemen to scale a cliff to his left and fire on the natives from above while the men in the river continued to press them. Upon seeing the 20 riflemen atop the cliff, the natives retreated. Sixteen Taiwan tribesmen were killed in the battle, including the Chief's son,House p. 91 14 were mortally wounded, including the Chief himself, and many more wounded. Japanese casualties were six killed, including an officer, and 30 wounded. In July there was an outbreak of malaria that killed over 550 Japanese troops. Both American foreign advisors contracted it, and while Wasson survived, Cassel died from the malaria he contracted on the expedition in spring the next year, 1875. He is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in Zanesville, Ohio. Sir Harry Parkes In November 1874 the Japanese forces withdrew from Taiwan after the Qing government agreed to an indemnity of 500,000 Kuping taels, or about silver. Sir Harry Parkes, the British minister to Japan, characterised this transaction as \\"China's willingness to pay to be invaded\\".  Aftermath  In 1875, the Qing authorities unsuccessfully attempted to bring the southeast coastal region of Taiwan under their control, dispatching a column of 300 soldiers against the Paiwan. The Chinese troops were ambushed and routed by the Paiwan and their well-armed fighters. Their casualties were 250 Chinese soldiers were killed; the 50 survivors retreated to Takow (Kaohsiung). Legacy Although launched ostensibly to punish the local tribesmen for their murder of 54 Ryukyuan merchants, the 1874 punitive expedition to Taiwan served a number of purposes for Japan's new Meiji government. Japan had for some time begun claiming suzerainty, and later sovereignty, over the Ryūkyū Kingdom, whose traditional suzerain had been China. The expedition demonstrated that China was not in effective control of Taiwan, let alone the Ryukyu Islands. Japan was emboldened to more forcefully assert its claim to speak for the Ryukyuan islanders. The settlement in 1874, brokered by the British, included a reference to Chinese recognition that the Japanese expedition was \\"in protection of civilians\\", a reference that Japan later pointed towards as Chinese renunciation of its rights over Ryukyu. In 1879 Japan referred the dispute to British arbitration, and the British confirmed Japanese sovereignty over the Ryukyus, a result which was not recognised by China. Nevertheless, Japan used this as the justification for taking de facto control over Ryukyu, moving the king of Ryukyu to Japan and incorporating Ryukyu as a prefecture of Japan. The ensuing Chinese protest led to the matter being submitted to US President Ulysses S. Grant as arbitrator, during which Japan offered to split Ryukyu between Japan and China. This was refused by China, but a weakened China was unable in practice to stop the Japanese annexation of the Ryukyus. The surrendering aborigines were given Japanese flags to fly over their villages that they viewed as a symbol of peace with Japan and protection from rival tribes, however, the Japanese viewed them as a symbol of jurisdiction over the aborigines. The expedition also served as a useful rehearsal for future Japanese imperial ambitions. Taiwan was already being viewed as a potential Japanese colony in some circles in Japan. Domestically, the action also mollified those within the Meiji government who were pushing for a more aggressive foreign policy, and who were enraged by the government's refusal in 1873 to attack Korea. It is significant that the expedition took place shortly after the Saga Rebellion, and was led by Saigō Jūdō (Saigō Takamori's younger brother) and consisted largely of former Satsuma and Saga samurai. More generally, the Japanese incursion into Taiwan in 1874 and the feeble Chinese response was a blatant revelation of Chinese weakness and an invitation to further foreign encroachment in Taiwan. In particular, the success of the Japanese incursion was among the factors influencing the French decision to invade Taiwan in October 1884, during the Sino-French War. The Qing court belatedly attempted to strengthen its hold on Taiwan, and the Chinese imperial commissioner Shen Pao-chen made some improvements to the island's coastal defences during the second half of the 1870s. Further substantial improvements were made by the Chinese governor Liu Ming-ch'uan in the 1880s, in the wake of the French capture of Keelung during the Sino-French War. However, little was done to improve the poor quality of the Qing garrison of Taiwan, and both the French in 1884 and the Japanese in 1895 were able to land successfully in Taiwan.

The AVA is the wine growing region which encompasses the drainage basin of the Willamette River. It stretches from the Columbia River in the north to just south of Eugene in the south, where the Willamette Valley ends; and from the Oregon Coast Range in the west to the Cascade Mountains in the east. At , it is the largest AVA in the state, and contains most of the state's wineries; approximately 200 as of 2006. The boundaries of the Willamette Valley AVA were established in 1984, and since then seven new, smaller AVAs have been created within the northern portion of Willamette Valley AVA. The Willamette Valley has a cool, moist climate, and is recognized worldwide for its Pinot noir. Although this distinction is not officially recognized, many wine connoisseurs further divide the Willamette Valley into northern and southern regions, the dividing line being the approximate latitude of Salem (approximately 45° north latitude).  Climate  The Willamette River Valley The climate of Willamette Valley is mild year- round. Winters are typically cool and wet, summers are dry and warm; heat above only occurs 5 to 15 days per year, and the temperature drops below once every 25 years. Most rainfall occurs in the late autumn, winter, and early spring, when temperatures are the coldest. The valley gets relatively little snow ( to ) per year. The hardiness zone is mostly 8b. Not all portions of the Willamette Valley are suitable for vineyards, however, and the largest concentration of wineries is found west of the Willamette River, on the leeward slopes of the Coast Range, or among the numerous river and stream valleys created by Willamette River tributaries. By far, the largest concentration of wineries is in Yamhill County.  Sub-appellations  There are seven American Viticultural Areas within the Willamette Valley AVA. These smaller AVAs recognize regions within the larger Willamette Valley AVA that have distinctive climate, soil, elevation, or other physical features that make them noteworthy for wine production.  Chehalem Mountains AVA  The Chehalem Mountains AVA, established in 2006, stretches from Wilsonville in the southeast to Forest Grove in the northwest. The Chehalem Mountains includes Ribbon Ridge, Parrett Mountain, and Bald Peak. The petition process for the creation of the AVA began in 2001 and was led by David Adelsheim of Adelsheim Vineyard.  Dundee Hills AVA  The Dundee Hills AVA in the hills north and west of Dundee. The area is 6,940 acres (28.1 km²) in total size, with 1,300 acres (530 ha) planted with grapes. Over 25 wineries and independent vineyards in this region produce over 44,000 cases of wine. The area is particularly noted for its Pinot noir; several wineries in the AVA have won international recognition for their wines.  Eola-Amity Hills AVA  The Eola-Amity Hills AVA stretches from the town of Amity in the north to Salem in the south. The hills cover an area west of the Willamette River approximately long by wide. The Eola-Amity Hills area benefits from steady winds off the Pacific Ocean that reach the Willamette Valley through the Van Duzer corridor, a gap in the Oregon Coast Range, moderating the summer temperatures. The name Eola is a tribute to the windy conditions in the area, and is derived from Aeolus, the Greek god of wind.  McMinnville AVA  The McMinnville AVA near McMinnville was established in 2005, in the hills to the southwest of McMinnville, roughly running from McMinnville to Sheridan. The AVA includes 14 wineries and of vineyards, and includes lands with elevations ranging from 200 to .  Ribbon Ridge AVA  The Ribbon Ridge AVA, between Newberg and Gaston, is a ridge containing uplift of ocean sediment. It lies at 45° 21' N, 123° 04' W, at the northwest end of the Chehalem Mountains. The name originates in the 19th century. The ridge is approximately wide and long, and is in area, with planted on 20 vineyards. It is estimated that between and in the region is suitable for planting.  Van Duzer Corridor AVA  The Van Duzer Corridor AVA is located just west of the Eola-Amity Hills AVA covering approximately 59,871 acres. The Van Duzer wind AVA is known low elevations and gently rolling hills, cool breezes from the Pacific Ocean, and soils which are primarily uplifted marine sedimentary loams and silts with alluvial overlay. The AVA was established in 2019.  Yamhill-Carlton District AVA  The Yamhill-Carlton District AVA in the area surrounding the towns of Yamhill and Carlton. Only grapes grown in vineyards with elevations ranging from to may be used to produce wines that bear the appellation name on their labels. The AVA includes over of vineyard, and the region is in the rain shadow of the Oregon Coast Range, a short distance to the west. The AVA was established in 2005.

He composed mainly in Sanskrit. Only a few of his compositions have survived, but they are recognised as great compositions of Carnatic music.  Life  Sadasiva was born into a Telugu Velanadu Brahmin couple Moksha Somasundara Avadhaani and Parvati. His initial name was Sivaramakrishna. He was married at the age of 17. Sadasiva lived in Kumbakonam, in Tamil Nadu in the 17th to 18th century. He went to learn vedas and other various subjects in Sanskrit in Thiruvisanallur. His contemporaries such as Sridhara Ayyavaal and Sri Bhagvan Nama Bodendral of Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam lived in the nearby areas at that time. Shiva ramakrishna left his home in search of Truth. He became the sishya of Sri Paramasivendra Saraswathi Swamigal of Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam. He started aathma vichara and mahavaakya upadesas from his guru.After taking sanyasa, he is said to have wandered around, naked or semi-naked, and often in a trance-like state. He was reclusive and often meditated, and was described as being in a \\"supremely intoxicated state\\". He is said to have performed many miracles whilst alive, some of the most prominent are provided below. His jiva samadhi site is briefly mentioned in 'Autobiography of a Yogi' by Paramahamsa Yogananda. On the river banks of Cauvery in Mahadhanapuram, he was asked by some children to be taken to Madurai, more than 100 miles away, for an annual festival. The saint asked them to close their eyes, and a few seconds later they reopened their eyes and found they were in Madurai. He also wrote the Atma Vidya Vilasa, an advaitic work. There is an epilogue to this story. The next day, another youth, incredulous at hearing this story, asked Sadasiva to take him also to this festival. It is said that the youth immediately found himself in the distant city. When it was time to return, Sadasiva was nowhere to be found. The youth had to make his way back on foot. Whilst relaxing near a heap of grains, he began meditating. The farmer who owned the land mistook Sadasiva for a thief, and confronted him. The farmer raised his stick to hit the saint, but became a statue. He remained in this state until the morning, when Sadasiva finished meditating and smiled at the farmer. The farmer was restored to his normal state, and asked the saint for forgiveness. At another time, while meditating on the banks of the Cauvery river, he was carried away by a sudden flood. Weeks later, when some villagers were digging near a mound of earth, their shovels struck his body. He woke up and walked away. Temple service He is said to have met the Raja Thondaiman of Pudukottai and initiated him into the Dakshinamurthy Mantra. He is said to have written the mantra on sand. This sand was picked up by the king and it is in the worship of the royal family till now in the Dakshinamoorthy temple inside the Pudukottai palace in Pudukottai. He was responsible for installing the deity Punnainallur Mariamman near Thanjavur and guided the installation at Devadanapatti Kamakshi temple. He was also involved in the Kalyana Venkatesa Perumal temple at Karur. He also installed the Hanuman Murthi in the Prasanna Venkateswara temple at Nalu Kal Mandapam in Thanjavur. He also installed Lord Ganesh and a powerful Ganesh Yantra at the Thirunageshwaram Rahu Stalam temple at Kumbakonam. An inscription in the temple bears testimony to this fact. The shrine can still be seen at the entrance to the temple. He has five samadhis : * Nerur (Tamil Nadu) * Manamadurai * Puri * Kashi * Karachi Every year in Nerur and Manamadurai, music festivals are conducted in his honor. In Manamadurai his samadhi is located at the Somanathar temple, which was identified by Sri Sivan SAR, Purvashrama Bratha (Brother) of the Paramacharya of Kanchi.http://columbuscarnatic.org/2011/10/sadasiva-brahmendra/ Sri Sri Sacchidananda Shivabhinava Nrusimha Bharati, pontiff of the Sringeri Saradha Peetham had visited Nerur and composed two slokas in praise of Sri Sadasiva Bramhendra - Sadasivendra Stava and Sadasivendra Pancharatnahttp://www.sringeri.net/2012/07/17/stotra/guru/sri-sadashivendra- stava.htm Books He is the author of several Sanskrit works.

Komppa was born in Viipuri in 1867. While in the secondary school in Viborg, Hugo Zilliacus, the teacher of arithmetic and science, cemented Komppa's interest in scientific research. Komppa furnished his own chemistry laboratory in the carriage shed of his parents' house after the instructions in Julius Adolph Stöckhard's book Schule der Chemie. He graduated from the Helsinki University of Technology in 1891 and subsequently worked for a while in Switzerland with Arthur Hantzsch before obtaining his Ph.D. Shortly after returning to Finland he became the professor of chemistry at the Helsinki University of Technology. From 1935 to 1945 he was chancellor of the University of Turku. He was also a board member in several major Finnish corporations and a founding member of Finnish Academy of Science and Letters. Universities of Uppsala, Copenhagen and Heidelberg invited him as an honorary doctor. Komppa worked extensively with organic synthesis of several compounds, most notably camphor and terpenoids. The camphor synthesis was an important breakthrough, especially because he proceeded to commercialize a semisynthesis from tall oil-derived pinene. He also developed methods for converting peat into fuel. During his career Komppa published more than 200 research papers.

It had 90 locks, was chartered in 1828 and completed in 1848. However, the middle section of the canal had many problems from the beginning and fell into disrepair. The canal ceased to operate in 1852, when the Cold Run Reservoir Dam outside of Lisbon, Ohio failed, ruining a large section of the canal. Major D.B. Douglas of the United States Military Academy surveyed a route in 1828. This route was , with seven aqueducts, 100 locks and a tunnel. The west division would rise for , the middle division would be , with tunnel, at summit elevation, and the east division would fall over . The Douglas plan was rejected, and the Philadelphia Board of Trade decided that the Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal would be a better option to join the canal systems of Ohio to those of Pennsylvania. At a meeting in Waynesburg, Ohio, in 1834, the canal promoters decided to go ahead without the Philadelphia backing. Hother Hage and Edward H. Gill were hired to engineer the project, and made changes to the Douglas plan. The canal, as constructed, consisted of the western division with a long aqueduct above the Tuscarawas River to connect to the Ohio and Erie Canal, 33 locks, five miles (8 km) of slackwater, two reservoirs, and a rise from at Bolivar to at Kensington. The middle division from Kensington to Lockbridge had two tunnels, and two reservoirs and was , all at 1120 feet. The big tunnel was 900 yards or 1060 yards long. The little tunnel was about long. The tunnels were about high, and the big tunnel was about below the highest elevation of the hill it penetrated. The Eastern division was from Lockbridge to Glasgow, lowering from to , with 57 locks, 20 dams, and of slackwater. Construction progressed until being interrupted by financial difficulties of the Panic of 1837. The number of workmen decreased from 2000 to 200. Little was done for seven years, and the tunnels were finally completed in 1848. Aside from the reservoir collapse in 1852, the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad was built that year, taking business away. Six miles on the west end of the canal were used as a feeder of the Ohio and Erie Canal until 1884, when the aqueduct was lost in a flood. A company called the “Nimishillen and Sandy Slackwater Navigation” was established to investigate a connector along the Nimishillen Creek from Sandyville, Ohio to Canton, Ohio in 1834–35. It was determined there was not enough water flow along this route to build a canal. A similar stillborn plan called the “Still Fork of Sandy Navigation Company” was incorporated in 1837 by some Carroll County, Ohio men to build a connector from Pekin up the Still Fork to near Carrollton, Ohio. An original dam near Waynesburg, , still impounds a slackwater on the Sandy Creek, and feeds a section of canal downstream to Magnolia, Ohio. Only of this privately funded canal lay in Pennsylvania; the rest was in Ohio. See also *Hanoverton Canal Town District *List of canals in the United States *Elson Mill is fed by the canal.

Founding  In 1927 Jack L. Maddux, an owner of a Los Angeles Ford and Lincoln car dealership, founded Maddux Air Lines. The airline's inaugural flight was on September 22, 1927 when the airline's Ford 4-AT Tri-motor carrying 12 passengers flew from San Diego, California to Los Angeles, California. This flight was to a small dirt landing strip that would later become Los Angeles International Airport, although the landing strip, called Inglewood Site, was not suitable for the airline, and Jack Maddux chose instead Rogers Airport, with improved facilities, and later Grand Central Air Terminal in Glendale. Among the passengers were several notables, and although the event was kept relatively quiet, it served as a publicity act.  Further history  In the remaining few months of 1927 Maddux carried 1400 passengers.Who was Jack Maddux- Revisited For the following few years Maddux expanded its fleet of Ford Tri-motors and its routes. The airline's hubs were in Los Angeles and San Diego. In April 1928 Maddux started passenger service from Los Angeles to San Francisco, California, with scheduled stops in Fresno and Oakland and, by reservation, in Visalia and Bakersfield. It competed with Western Air Express on this route. Service also began from San Diego to Agua Caliente, Tijuana, in Mexico, in November. 9440 passengers were transported that year. Graf Zeppelin then visiting Los Angeles (August, 1929) In February 1929 passenger service to Phoenix, Arizona began. Other local short-hop flights were also added. On August 26, 1929 a Maddux Tri-motor, along with other aircraft, escorted the famous LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin airship to Mines Field (now part of Los Angeles International Airport) where it stopped during its around the world flight. Among the famous aviators who were involved with Maddux were Charles Lindbergh and Amelia Earhart. Maddux also had a publicity department that advertised the celebrities who flew with the airline. These included Will Rogers, who rode on the inaugural flight, and Hollywood actors Arthur Edmund Carewe and Dolores del Río.http://oldbeacon.com/beacon/airlines/usa/maddux.htm Maddux Air Line, established in 1927 was the California terminus for Trancontinental Air Transport (TAT) when it started New York to California operations in July 1929. For six months the Maddux and TAT airplanes carried a combination logo of their two companies until TAT bought out Maddux in November 1929. Lindbergh helped establish TAT but had nothing to do with the Maddux operation.  Merging  On November 16, 1929 Transcontinental Air Transport (T-A-T), an airline offering transcontinental service with the use of trains and planes, bought Maddux Air Lines, resulting in TAT-Maddux Air Lines, with Jack Maddux as the western head. Charles Lindbergh, who worked more with TAT than with Maddux, stayed at the Maddux's home to negotiate the merger. Combined, this airline operated the largest fleet of Tri-motors at the time, including seven 5-AT's and several more 4-AT's, carrying 40,000 passengers in 1929. In 1930 TAT-Maddux merged with its former competitor Western Air Express to form Transcontinental & Western Air (T&WA;), which later became TWA.  Accidents  On April 21, 1929 a Maddux Air Lines Ford 5-AT-B Tri-motor was involved in a midair collision with a single-engine U.S. Army Boeing PW-9D pursuit biplane near San Diego. Shortly after taking off from San Diego, the airliner was flying at around 2,000 feet on its way to Imperial Valley, California, when the pilot of the biplane buzzed the airliner and, misjudging its speed, collided with it. The army pilot, Lieutenant Howard W. Keefer, tried to bail out of the wreckage, but his parachute got entangled, and both aircraft crashed near the Lexington Park subdivision of eastern San Diego on the side of a canyon. All five people aboard the Tri-Motor and the Army pilot, who was found “criminally negligent” for approaching the airliner, died in the crash. This was the first midair collision involving a U.S. airliner. On January 19, 1930 TAT-Maddux Flight Number 7, a Ford 5-AT-C Tri-Motor crashed north of Oceanside, California. Flying from the races at Agua Caliente Racetrack, near Tijuana, Mexico to Los Angeles, the plane encountered rain, low clouds, fog, and possibly engine problems. The pilots were attempting to turn around and/or land when they misjudged the aircraft's height off the ground and the left wing struck the ground, slamming the aircraft into the ground, which subsequently caught fire.

Education Barnett received his B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from M.I.T., his M.B.A. from the University of California, Berkeley, and his M.A. and Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University. Positions Barnett is currently the Oswald Distinguished Professor of Macroeconomics at the University of Kansas and Director of the Center for Financial Stability, in New York City. He is also a Fellow of the IC² Institute at the University of Texas at Austin and a Fellow of the Johns Hopkins Institute for Applied Economics, Global Health, and the Study of Business Enterprise. He is the founder and President of the Society for Economic Measurement. He is also the Director of the Institute for Nonlinear Dynamical Inference at RUDN University in Moscow. He was previously Research Economist at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Washington, D.C.; Stuart Centennial Professor of Economics at the University of Texas at Austin; and Professor of Economics at Washington University in St. Louis. Prior to becoming an economist, he worked from 1963 to 1969, as an engineer at Rocketdyne division of the Rockwell International Corporation on development of the F-1 and J-2 rocket engines during Apollo program. Research His research is in macroeconomics and econometrics. He is Founding President of the Society for Economic Measurement, Founding Editor of the Cambridge University Press journal, Macroeconomic Dynamics and of the Emerald Group Publishing monograph series, International Symposia in Economic Theory and Econometrics, and originator of the Divisia monetary aggregates and the \\"Barnett critique\\". In consumer demand and production modelling, he originated the Laurent series approach to specification design and the seminonparametric approach using the Müntz–Szász theorem. His publications on bifurcation analysis and nonlinear dynamics have shown that robustness of dynamical inferences is compromised, when policy simulations are run only at point estimates of parameters, since confidence regions about those estimates are often crossed by bifurcation boundaries. He is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, a Charter Fellow of the Journal of Econometrics, a Charter Fellow of the Society for Economic Measurement, a Fellow of the World Innovation Foundation, a Fellow of the IC² Institute, and a Fellow of the Johns Hopkins Institute for Applied Economics, Global Health, and the Study of Business Enterprise, and Honorary Professor at Henan University in Kaifeng, China. He is ranked among the top 2% of the world's economists in RePEc. His book with Nobel Laureate, Paul A. Samuelson, Inside the Economist's Mind: Conversations with Eminent Economists, Wiley-Blackwell Publishing (2007), , has been translated into seven languages. His MIT Press book, Getting It Wrong: How Faulty Monetary Statistics Undermine the Fed, the Financial System, and the Economy, , won the American Publishers Award for Professional and Scholarly Excellence (the PROSE Awards) for the best book published in economics during 2012. During January 2017, he was interviewed in depth about his life's work by Apostolos Serletis. A conference in his honor was held at the Bank of England on May 23–24, 2017.

Mostly settled in the Peruvian capital, Lima, Croatian-Peruvians have scattered throughout the vast metropolis, but are known to have established a strong community in the Miraflores District, where strong ties to the ethnic group still remain. Due to intermarriage, most Croatian-Peruvians are of mixed ancestry. Actual conversations in Croatian are common only within first generation immigrants. Although Croatian speech in Peru has been generally lost. Most Croatian- Peruvians are Roman Catholic and either completely Croat or of mixed European origin. Included are Istro-Romanians, who became adjusted to Peruvian society because of the linguistic similarities between Istro-Romanian and Spanish, as well as Latin identity of Istro-Romanians. History Peru was the first South American country to receive immigrants from Croatia. Early settlers came from the Republic of Ragusa (modern-day Dubrovnik) in the 16th century. A more significant number of immigrants arrived in the second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century, mostly from the Dubrovnik area and the rest of the Croatian Adriatic coast. Some Croats were involved in the guano business that was flourishing in the late 19th century; others pursued copper, gold and silver mining in the Andes. By the end of the 19th century, Croats were the most prominent foreign community in the mining town of Cerro de Pasco. Once again, a heavy wave of Croatian immigration took place once World War II began. This time, however, an estimate of 352 Croatians are recorded to have arrived in Lima.familia croata en el Perú. Marko Burin Many settled in the populous Miraflores district and cultural assimilation was smooth due to similarities in religion and cooperation of the native residents. Immigrant bachelors often married the local women and settled in Lima. Few are known to have left Peru to go back to either Croatia or other countries. A group of approximately 1,000 political emigrants from Croatia arrived in the country in 1948. The new generation of immigrants differed significantly from the old one, and the two populations remained separate for a long time. Today the Croatian government estimates 6,000 Peruvians are of Croatian origin and most are Peruvian-born; few of the actual immigrants still remain alive. Croatian-Peruvians today Croatian-Peruvians are not a widely known ethnic group in Peru, nonetheless their contributions are noted in everyday life. Most popular among these is the sport of bocce, bochas in English and Spanish, a simple ball game known all over Europe and very popular in Croatia. Gatherings in the affluent Regatas Lima country club in the Limenian district of Chorrillos became common after bocha alleys were constructed there, and soon all over the city. Bochas is now a renowned sport for Croatians and non- Croatians alike all over Peru. Many Croatian-Peruvians had humble beginnings in Peru, but have progressed greatly from then. Many became renowned in Peru's already successful fishing industry and others were able to obtain steady jobs in other trades. Croatian cuisine had relative fame in Lima and several Croatian-Peruvians opened their own restaurants, which served mostly seafood. Palachinke is a well-known pancake restaurant in Lima of Croatian origin. It owns three establishments in the city.

All but two essays of this book are reprinted in We Tell Ourselves Stories in Order to Live: Collected Nonfiction (2006). \\"Insider Baseball\\" and \\"Shooters, Inc.\\" are not included. Prologue \\"After Henry\\" A personal memorial for Henry Robbins, who was Didion's friend and editor from 1966 until he died in 1979. The essays collected in this book were written after Henry's death. Washington Two of the three essays from the \\"Washington\\" section of the book were republished in 2001 as part of Didion's book Political Fictions. \\"In the Realm of the Fisher King\\" Analyzes Ronald Reagan's style of government, mostly through the character of his wife and other handlers. Didion says that the Reagans maintained, in their years in Sacramento and Washington, the sheltered, disconnected lifestyle of \\"actors on location,\\" living in housing provided by the studio. A refrain in the piece is the public-relations language of Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan, putting words to the president's grandiose but vague political vision: \\"Where brave heroes blank, and during those terrible last days blank...\\" First appeared in 1989 in The New York Review of Books. \\"Insider Baseball\\" Chronicles the failed 1988 presidential campaign of democratic candidate Michael Dukakis. Didion takes as her central image a campaign stop in which Dukakis, for the benefit of news cameras, tossed a baseball with an aide on the tarmac of an airport runway, an event duly reported as news by a number of journalists \\"all of whom believed it to be a setup and yet most of whom believed that only an outsider, someone too 'naive' to know the rules of the game, would so describe it.\\" First appeared in the October 27, 1988 issue of The New York Review of Books. \\"Shooters Inc.\\" On the occasion of Bush's election in 1988, describes the American political strategy of using brief engagements in foreign wars as \\"sideshows,\\" treating \\"other nations as changeable scrims in the theatre of domestic politics.\\" Didion states that, when Bush toured Israel and Jordan, the Jordanian government was instructed to provide a camel for the background of every photo opportunity. First appeared in 1988 in The New York Review of Books. California \\"Girl of the Golden West\\" An essay on Patty Hearst, written after the release of Hearst's 1982 memoir Every Secret Thing . Didion recounts the history as a Californian opera, and Hearst as an emblematic Californian character in her lack of self-analysis or sense of connection to history, and she illustrates this point with a quote from a survivor of the Donner Party: \\"Don't let this letter dishearten anybody, never take no cutoffs and hurry along as fast as you can.\\" Didion would return to this quote in her longer consideration of Californian character, Where I Was From, in 2003. First appeared in 1982 in The New York Review of Books. \\"Pacific Distances\\" A disparate series of reflections on Didion's own experiences in the Pacific, centering on the University of California, Berkeley. *The first section recalls her culture shock at moving from New York to Los Angeles, at first finding the \\"absence of narrative\\" in L.A.'s public culture \\"a deprivation\\" but after two years realizing \\"I had come to find narrative sentimental.\\" *The second section reviews her career at Berkeley, first as a writing student in 1954 and then as a writing teacher in 1975. *The third section is about the history of the experimental TRIGA nuclear reactor at Berkeley and Didion's sense as a child of the beginning of the atomic age. *The fourth section is about the laser project at Livermore Labs, where nuclear weapons were also developed. *The fifth section chronicles an extended stay in Honolulu, where Didion rented a house in the Kahala district during a 1980 garbage strike. *The final section crosses the Pacific to Hong Kong, where 300,000 refugees from the Vietnam War fled in late 1970s and were forcibly repatriated to Vietnam in 1991.

First appeared in 1989 in The New Yorker under the title \\"Letters from Los Angeles.\\" \\"L.A. Noir\\" Chronicles a murder trial suggesting links between Hollywood and Colombia drug cartels: the wife of a man alleged to have been a high-level dealer was accused of murdering a small-time movie producer. The murder was said to have been over anticipated profits from The Cotton Club, and the supposed connection to that movie's producer Robert Evans gave the case a very faint air of celebrity, as did the fact that two accused accomplices in the murder were bodyguards of Larry Flynt. Rumors flew that the case would be made into a book or movie. Didion notes that everyone involved was motivated by unrealized fantasies, from the criminals who killed for a stake in a flop to prosecutors and reporters hoping that this obscure, sordid crime could itself be turned into a glamorous Hollywood production. First appeared in 1989 in The New Yorker under the title \\"Letters from Los Angeles.\\" \\"Fire Season\\" Describes southern California's annual season of wildfires, the role of the Santa Ana winds, and the way in which fire is a part of the rhythm of a Californian view of the world.

They were one of the more significant trios of that era, and played a major role in the gradual transition between ska and rocksteady into reggae with their three-part harmonies. The Heptones were contemporaries of the Wailers and the Maytals, and every bit their equal in the mid-60's. History Leroy Sibbles, Earl Morgan and Barry Llewellyn first came together as \\"The Hep Ones\\" in 1965 in Kingston but they soon changed their name to \\"The Heptones\\". The name was chosen by Morgan after seeing a Heptones Tonic bottle lying in a pile of refuse.Thompson, Dave (2002) Reggae & Caribbean Music, Backbeat Books, , p. 114 The Heptones recorded for major Jamaican record producers at the time. They began their career, after one unsuccessful single for Ken Lack's \\"K Calnek\\" label, under the watchful eye of Coxsone Dodd of Studio One. The Heptones had a number of Jamaican hits for Studio One, beginning with \\"Fattie Fattie\\", their first Studio One single in 1966.Moskowitz, David V. (2006) Caribbean Popular Music: an Encyclopedia of Reggae, Mento, Ska, Rock Steady, and Dancehall, Greenwood Press, , p.133 This began a long run of success for Coxsone, including \\"Pretty Looks Isn't All\\", \\"Get In The Groove\\", \\"Be a Man\\", \\"Sea of Love\\" (a cover of the Phil Phillips and the Twilights doo-wop classic), \\"Ting a Ling\\", \\"Party Time\\", and \\"I Hold the Handle.\\" They were the chief rivals to The Techniques, who recorded for Arthur \\"Duke\\" Reid, as the top vocal act of the rocksteady era. During their five years at Brentford Road, the home of Studio One, Leroy Sibbles played bass on numerous sessions, auditioned acts, and, along with Jackie Mittoo, was the chief studio arranger. Some of their instrumental session work was released as the Soul Vendors and Sound Dimension. Amongst the rhythms featuring Sibbles' bass playing are Alton Ellis' \\"I'm Still in Love\\", \\"Full Up\\" (used on Musical Youth's \\"Pass The Dutchie\\"), and The Abyssinians \\"Satta Massagana\\". The Heptones remained at Studio One well into the reggae era, where they cut tunes such as \\"Message from a Black Man\\", \\"Love Won't Come Easy\\", \\"I Hold (Got) The Handle\\", \\"I Love You\\", and a successful cover version of \\"Suspicious Minds\\", then went on to record with Joe Gibbs and Harry J in the early 1970s. They had a big hit with \\"Book of Rules\\" (based on an American poem called \\"A Bag of Tools\\" by R.L.Sharpe) in 1973. It was one of the group's few songs not sung by Sibbles. Barry Llewelyn sang lead and co-wrote \\"Book of Rules\\". Musically, the song was heavily influenced by Glen Campbell's \\"Try A Little Kindness.\\" The song was featured on the soundtrack for the 1978 Jamaican film Rockers and the 1998 American comedy-thriller film Homegrown. Sibbles emigrated to Canada in 1973 and the group suspended recording activities, returning in 1975 to once again record at Harry J's Kingston studio. In 1975, The Heptones signed an album deal with Island Records. Two albums resulted: Night Food in 1976 and Party Time in 1977. Night Food was produced by Danny Holloway, and featured several re-recorded Studio One classics, as well as originals such as \\"Country Boy\\" and \\"Mama Say\\". The group toured England with Toots & The Maytals to support Night Food's release. In 1977, The Heptones recorded Party Time with Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry. They had issued a number of singles (including a cover of Billy Stewart's \\"I Do Love You\\") on his Justice League imprint five years previously. Party Time was recorded during Black Ark's peak period. Party Time also included remakes of Studio One tunes, as well as Bob Dylan's \\"I Shall Be Released\\", along with newer compositions such as \\"Sufferers' Time\\". In the same era, they released a number of 12\\" singles with Lee Perry, such as \\"Mystery Babylon\\", \\"Mr. President\\" (featuring DJ Jah Lloyd), and \\"Babylon's Falling\\". Sibbles left the group once more in 1978 to start a successful solo career, having already cut a solo version of \\"Love Won't Come Easy\\" for Augustus Pablo, and having cut his own solo singles for Lee Perry (\\"Rasta Fari\\" and \\"Garden of Life\\") and Dennis Brown's DEB Music (\\"New Song\\" and \\"Ain't No Love\\"). He was replaced by Dolphin \\"Naggo\\" Morris, who had recorded \\"Su Su Pon Rasta\\" for Joe Gibbs and \\"You Should Love Your Brother\\" for King Jammys, but the group's popularity waned. By the late 1970s, their slick stage suits and covers of pop tunes found little favour with audiences more used to more \\"militant\\" dreadlocked performers singing of Rastafari, and they began to be perceived as relics of an older era. Despite being produced by Joseph Hoo Kim at Channel One, Good Life (1979) saw the group treading water, and the years that followed brought little success. The original trio reunited in 1995, and released Pressure!, produced by Tapper Zukie. Barry Llewellyn died on 23 November 2011, in Kingston Public Hospital, at the age of 64. As of 2016, the line-up featured Morgan with Robert Dacres and Carlton Scarlett. This line-up recorded the album Rebel Love, set for release in May 2016.

This means of delivery is largely founded on nanomedicine, which plans to employ nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery in order to combat the downfalls of conventional drug delivery. These nanoparticles would be loaded with drugs and targeted to specific parts of the body where there is solely diseased tissue, thereby avoiding interaction with healthy tissue. The goal of a targeted drug delivery system is to prolong, localize, target and have a protected drug interaction with the diseased tissue. The conventional drug delivery system is the absorption of the drug across a biological membrane, whereas the targeted release system releases the drug in a dosage form. The advantages to the targeted release system is the reduction in the frequency of the dosages taken by the patient, having a more uniform effect of the drug, reduction of drug side-effects, and reduced fluctuation in circulating drug levels. The disadvantage of the system is high cost, which makes productivity more difficult and the reduced ability to adjust the dosages. Targeted drug delivery systems have been developed to optimize regenerative techniques. The system is based on a method that delivers a certain amount of a therapeutic agent for a prolonged period of time to a targeted diseased area within the body. This helps maintain the required plasma and tissue drug levels in the body, thereby preventing any damage to the healthy tissue via the drug. The drug delivery system is highly integrated and requires various disciplines, such as chemists, biologists, and engineers, to join forces to optimize this system.  Background In traditional drug delivery systems such as oral ingestion or intravascular injection, the medication is distributed throughout the body through the systemic blood circulation. For most therapeutic agents, only a small portion of the medication reaches the organ to be affected, such as in chemotherapy where roughly 99% of the drugs administered do not reach the tumor site.Trafton, A. Tumors Targeted Using Tiny Gold Particles. MIT Tech Talk. 2009, 53, 4–4. Targeted drug delivery seeks to concentrate the medication in the tissues of interest while reducing the relative concentration of the medication in the remaining tissues. For example, by avoiding the host's defense mechanisms and inhibiting non-specific distribution in the liver and spleen, a system can reach the intended site of action in higher concentrations. Targeted delivery is believed to improve efficacy while reducing side-effects. When implementing a targeted release system, the following design criteria for the system must be taken into account: the drug properties, side-effects of the drugs, the route taken for the delivery of the drug, the targeted site, and the disease. Increasing developments to novel treatments requires a controlled microenvironment that is accomplished only through the implementation of therapeutic agents whose side-effects can be avoided with targeted drug delivery. Advances in the field of targeted drug delivery to cardiac tissue will be an integral component to regenerate cardiac tissue. There are two kinds of targeted drug delivery: active targeted drug delivery, such as some antibody medications, and passive targeted drug delivery, such as the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR-effect).  Targeting Methods  This ability for nanoparticles to concentrate in areas of solely diseased tissue is accomplished through either one or both means of targeting: passive or active.  Passive Targeting  In passive targeting, the drug's success is directly related to circulation time.Sagnella, S.; Drummond, C. Drug Delivery: A Nanomedicine Approach. Australian Biochemist. [Online] 2012, 43, 5–8, 20. The Australian Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. This is achieved by cloaking the nanoparticle with some sort of coating. Several substances can achieve this, with one of them being polyethylene glycol (PEG). By adding PEG to the surface of the nanoparticle, it is rendered hydrophilic, thus allowing water molecules to bind to the oxygen molecules on PEG via hydrogen bonding. The result of this bond is a film of hydration around the nanoparticle which makes the substance antiphagocytic. The particles obtain this property due to the hydrophobic interactions that are natural to the reticuloendothelial system (RES), thus the drug-loaded nanoparticle is able to stay in circulation for a longer period of time.Vlerken, L. E. V.; Vyas, T. K.; Amiji, M. M. Poly(Ethylene Glycol)-Modified Nanocarriers for Tumor-Targeted and Intracellular Delivery. Pharm. Res. 2007, 24, 1405–1414. To work in conjunction with this mechanism of passive targeting, nanoparticles that are between 10 and 100 nanometers in size have been found to circulate systemically for longer periods of time.Gullotti, E.; Yeo, Y. Extracellularly Activated Nanocarriers: A New Paradigm of Tumor Targeted Drug Delivery. Mol. Pharm., [Online] 2009, 6, 1041-1051. ACS Publications.  Active Targeting  Active targeting of drug-loaded nanoparticles enhances the effects of passive targeting to make the nanoparticle more specific to a target site. There are several ways that active targeting can be accomplished. One way to actively target solely diseased tissue in the body is to know the nature of a receptor on the cell for which the drug will be targeted to. Researchers can then utilize cell-specific ligands that will allow the nanoparticle to bind specifically to the cell that has the complementary receptor. This form of active targeting was found to be successful when utilizing transferrin as the cell-specific ligand.Galvin, P.; Thompson, D.; Ryan, K. B.; Mccarthy, A.; Moore, A. C.; Burke, C. S.; Dyson, M.; Maccraith, B. D.; Gun’Ko, Y. K.; Byrne, M. T.; Volkov, Y.; Keely, C.; Keehan, E.; Howe, M.; Duffy, C.; Macloughlin, R. Nanoparticle-Based Drug Delivery: Case Studies for Cancer and Cardiovascular Applications. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. [Online] 2011, 69, 389–404. The transferrin was conjugated to the nanoparticle to target tumor cells that possess transferrin-receptor mediated endocytosis mechanisms on their membrane. This means of targeting was found to increase uptake, as opposed to non-conjugated nanoparticles. Active targeting can also be achieved by utilizing magnetoliposomes, which usually serves as a contrast agent in magnetic resonance imaging. Thus, by grafting these liposomes with a desired drug to deliver to a region of the body, magnetic positioning could aid with this process. Furthermore, a nanoparticle could possess the capability to be activated by a trigger that is specific to the target site, such as utilizing materials that are pH responsive. Most of the body has a consistent, neutral pH. However, some areas of the body are naturally more acidic than others, and, thus, nanoparticles can take advantage of this ability by releasing the drug when it encounters a specific pH. Another specific triggering mechanism is based on the redox potential. One of the side effects of tumors is hypoxia, which alters the redox potential in the vicinity of the tumor. By modifying the redox potential that triggers the payload release the vesicles can be selective to different types of tumors. By utilizing both passive and active targeting, a drug-loaded nanoparticle has a heightened advantage over a conventional drug. It is able to circulate throughout the body for an extended period of time until it is successfully attracted to its target through the use of cell-specific ligands, magnetic positioning, or pH responsive materials. Because of these advantages, side effects from conventional drugs will be largely reduced as a result of the drug-loaded nanoparticles affecting only diseased tissue.Mitra, A. K.; Kwatra, D.; Vadlapudi, A. D. Drug Delivery; Jones & Bartlett Learning: Burlington, Massachusetts, 2015. However, an emerging field known as nanotoxicology has concerns that the nanoparticles themselves could pose a threat to both the environment and human health with side effects of their own.Jong, W. H. D.; Borm, P. J. A. Drug Delivery and Nanoparticles: Applications and Hazards. Int. J. Nanomedicine. [Online] 2008, 3, 133–149. The National Center for Biotechnology Information. Active targeting can also be achieved through peptide based drug targeting system. Delivery vehicles There are different types of drug delivery vehicles, such as polymeric micelles, liposomes, lipoprotein-based drug carriers, nano- particle drug carriers, dendrimers, etc. An ideal drug delivery vehicle must be non-toxic, biocompatible, non-immunogenic, biodegradable, and must avoid recognition by the host's defense mechanisms[3]. Liposomes Liposomes are composite structures made of phospholipids and may contain small amounts of other molecules. Though liposomes can vary in size from low micrometer range to tens of micrometers, unilamellar liposomes, as pictured here, are typically in the lower size range, with various targeting ligands attached to their surface, allowing for their surface-attachment and accumulation in pathological areas for treatment of disease.Torchilin, VP “Multifunctional Nanocarriers.” Adv Drug Deliv Rev 2006 Dec; 58 (14): 1532-55 doi: 10.1016/j.addr.2006.09.009 The most common vehicle currently used for targeted drug delivery is the liposome. Liposomes are non-toxic, non-hemolytic, and non-immunogenic even upon repeated injections; they are biocompatible and biodegradable and can be designed to avoid clearance mechanisms (reticuloendothelial system (RES), renal clearance, chemical or enzymatic inactivation, etc.) Lipid-based, ligand-coated nanocarriers can store their payload in the hydrophobic shell or the hydrophilic interior depending on the nature of the drug/contrast agent being carried. The only problem to using liposomes in vivo is their immediate uptake and clearance by the RES system and their relatively low stability in vitro. To combat this, polyethylene glycol (PEG) can be added to the surface of the liposomes. Increasing the mole percent of PEG on the surface of the liposomes by 4-10% significantly increased circulation time in vivo from 200 to 1000 minutes. PEGylation of the liposomal nanocarrier elongates the half-life of the construct while maintaining the passive targeting mechanism that is commonly conferred to lipid-based nanocarriers. When used as a delivery system, the ability to induce instability in the construct is commonly exploited allowing the selective release of the encapsulated therapeutic agent in close proximity to the target tissue/cell in vivo. This nanocarrier system is commonly used in anti-cancer treatments as the acidity of the tumour mass caused by an over- reliance on glycolysis triggers drug release. Micelles and dendrimers Another type of drug delivery vehicle used is polymeric micelles. They are prepared from certain amphiphilic co-polymers consisting of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomer units. They can be used to carry drugs that have poor solubility. This method offers little in the terms of size control or function malleability. Techniques that utilize reactive polymers along with a hydrophobic additive to produce a larger micelle that create a range of sizes have been developed.Macosko, Cristopher W. \\"Polymer Nanoparticles Improve Delivery of Compounds” University of Minnesota Office for Technology Commercialization. Dendrimers are also polymer-based delivery vehicles. They have a core that branches out in regular intervals to form a small, spherical, and very dense nanocarrier. Biodegradable particles Biodegradable particles have the ability to target diseased tissue as well as deliver their payload as a controlled-release therapy. Biodegradable particles bearing ligands to P-selectin, endothelial selectin (E-selectin) and ICAM-1 have been found to adhere to inflamed endothelium. Therefore, the use of biodegradable particles can also be used for cardiac tissue. Artificial DNA nanostructures The success of DNA nanotechnology in constructing artificially designed nanostructures out of nucleic acids such as DNA, combined with the demonstration of systems for DNA computing, has led to speculation that artificial nucleic acid nanodevices can be used to target drug delivery based upon directly sensing its environment. These methods make use of DNA solely as a structural material and a chemical, and do not make use of its biological role as the carrier of genetic information. Nucleic acid logic circuits that could potentially be used as the core of a system that releases a drug only in response to a stimulus such as a specific mRNA have been demonstrated. In addition, a DNA \\"box\\" with a controllable lid has been synthesized using the DNA origami method. This structure could encapsulate a drug in its closed state, and open to release it only in response to a desired stimulus. Applications Targeted drug delivery can be used to treat many diseases, such as the cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. However, the most important application of targeted drug delivery is to treat cancerous tumors. In doing so, the passive method of targeting tumors takes advantage of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. This is a situation specific to tumors that results from rapidly forming blood vessels and poor lymphatic drainage. When the blood vessels form so rapidly, large fenestrae result that are 100 to 600 nanometers in size, which allows enhanced nanoparticle entry. Further, the poor lymphatic drainage means that the large influx of nanoparticles are rarely leaving, thus, the tumor retains more nanoparticles for successful treatment to take place. The American Heart Association rates cardiovascular disease as the number one cause of death in the United States. Each year 1.5 million myocardial infarctions (MI), also known as heart attacks, occur in the United States, with 500,000 leading to deaths. The costs related to heart attacks exceed $60 billion per year. Therefore, there is a need to come up with an optimum recovery system. The key to solving this problem lies in the effective use of pharmaceutical drugs that can be targeted directly to the diseased tissue. This technique can help develop many more regenerative techniques to cure various diseases. The development of a number of regenerative strategies in recent years for curing heart disease represents a paradigm shift away from conventional approaches that aim to manage heart disease. Stem cell therapy can be used to help regenerate myocardium tissue and return the contractile function of the heart by creating/supporting a microenvironment before the MI. Developments in targeted drug delivery to tumors have provided the groundwork for the burgeoning field of targeted drug delivery to cardiac tissue. Recent developments have shown that there are different endothelial surfaces in tumors, which has led to the concept of endothelial cell adhesion molecule-mediated targeted drug delivery to tumors. Liposomes can be used as drug delivery for the treatment of tuberculosis. The traditional treatment for TB is skin to chemotherapy which is not overly effective, which may be due to the failure of chemotherapy to make a high enough concentration at the infection site. The liposome delivery system allows for better microphage penetration and better builds a concentration at the infection site.Medscape from WebMD [Internet]. New York: WebMD LLC; 1994-2015. Liposomes as Drug Delivery Systems for the Treatment of TB; 2011 [cited 2015 May 8] Available from: http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/752329_3 The delivery of the drugs works intravenously and by inhalation. Oral intake is not advised because the liposomes break down in the Gastrointestinal System. 3D printing is also used by doctors to investigate how to target cancerous tumors in a more efficient way. By printing a plastic 3D shape of the tumor and filling it with the drugs used in the treatment the flow of the liquid can be observed allowing the modification of the doses and targeting location of the drugs.Hirschler B. 2014. 3D Printing Points Way to Smarter Cancer Treatment.

Cars treated with the rustproofing displayed a sticker in the window with the name \\"Rusty Jones\\" and a picture of the cartoon character (also named Rusty Jones) from the company's TV commercials. The company was based in Chicago, Illinois.  Formation  In the 1970s a Chicago company, Body by Thixo-Tex, became successful on a local scale by offering aftermarket rustproofing services to automobile owners. The company engaged an advertising agency, Dawson, Johns & Black, to promote the brand, which they did by creating the Rusty Jones name and character. Company revenue increased fifty-fold within two years, and Rusty Jones became a nationally known service rivaling Ziebart, the previously established leader.Frank Lane, Killer Brands, 2007 Rusty Jones became a part of Matex Corporation. Rusty Jones was founded by Michael Mater, originally from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He moved to Chicago around 1965 and founded Matex Corporation around 1970. Matex, the parent company of Rusty Jones, was a modified version of Michael's last name, Mater. Mater was born in 1940 and died in 2002 at the age of 62. The name Thixo-Tex was derived from the thixotropic properties of the rustproofing chemical that was applied to the cars. Thixotropic means a viscous fluid that will flow to self-heal small abrasions. The reason for the change in the product name from Thixo-Tex to Rusty Jones was no one could remember the name \\"Thixo-Tex\\". Matex Corporation was a privately held corporation with the corporate headquarters located at 6200 North Hiawatha Ave., Chicago. Mater sold Rusty Jones to Beatrice Foods family of companies in 1984 with annual sales of $150 million. He stayed on with Beatrice with a five-year contract as president. Beatrice cannibalized most of the company and cut advertising budgets by more than half. The new owners moved advertising away from NASCAR and allowed the company to lose market share. As the company was failing Beatrice asked Mater if he would buy the company back. He declined due to the damage Beatrice had done to the brand and Beatrice's failure to listen to Mater's protests against the business plan and marketing cuts.  Marketing  The firm's slogan was Hello Rusty Jones, goodbye rusty cars. In a typical television commercial of 1979, the animated character rode on the roof of a car while saying, \\"Hi, I’m Rusty Jones, and you know what?

They were, in any event, unappreciated by middle-class Haitians who preferred works that aped French paintings; they did not value Obin's representations of Haitian street scenes or his visions of Haitian history. The artist also painted murals and other decorative pieces for commercial establishments, fraternal organizations, and Protestant chapels in the beginning.  Early life and education  Born in Cap-Hatïen, Haiti, Obin was the third child of Mr. and Mrs. Obénard Obin. He received rudimentary instruction in drawing as a boy and produced his first known painting when he was 16 in 1908.  Centre d'Art  By 1944 the artist was in despair. \\"Dear God,\\" he wrote on a small blackboard in his home, in Cap-Haitian, \\"the year 1944 was a bad one for Philomé Obin. Please make 1945 a better year for him.\\" He had reason for hope. Word had reached him of the opening, earlier in 1944, of a Centre d’Art in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's distant capital. The Centre had been established by Dewitt Peters, an American Quaker and conscientious objector who had been sent to Haiti by the U.S. Office of Education as an alternative to World War II military service. Seeing the imaginative works that decorated many voodoo temples, or ounfò (), Peters, also an artist, suspected that the country harbored much talent waiting to be discovered. He resolved to find and promote i Front cover of the political satire book, \\"Bakoulou\\" [The Con Man], given to Philomé Obin and signed by his good friend and fellow painter, Dewitt Peters, an American Quaker Dewitt Peter's signature on the inside cover of the \\"Bakoulou\\" [The Con Man] book, given to Philomé Obin Philomé Obin sent Peters, at the Centre d'Art, a small painting extolling U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt for ending the 1915–34 American Occupation of Haiti. Peters immediately recognized Obin's genius; the small payment he sent the artist was by far the largest Obin had ever received. (Obin would later paint at least three other paintings of FDR, one showing him with Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin, another of an angelic Roosevelt \\"interceding in heaven for the unity of the Americas.\\") The two men—Peters and Obin—would become good friends over the years.  Paintings  Selden Rodman, a Peters's associate, visited Obin at his residence in Cap-Haïtien. Now, with his 1944 prayer answered, Philomé sent painting after painting to the Centre d'Art. Soon his fame was such that both art-lovers and souvenir-hunting tourists were seeking him out. His prices rose steadily; by the 1970s he—who had sold works for a paltry sum—was painting only on commission, asking and getting $1,000 to $3,000 for paintings the size of 20x24 inches.  Vision de L'Artiste Philomé Obin  Among the works of Philomé's first four decades that have survived is Vision de l'Artiste Philomé Obin pendant la nuit du 15 au 16 Janvier 1948. (He never sold that painting, which graced his living room until his death.) It shows a lovely mulatress seated on a boulder in a mostly barren landscape. Many have erroneously interpreted this painting, contending that it represents \\"Maîtresse Zulie\\", a voodoo goddess. The reality is that Obin's dream was so vivid that he decided to capture it on his canvas, this he explained to this editor in 1983. He added that he found amusing the aura created by pundits around this particular painting. Like most of his paintings, it bears both his boxed signature and its title, in neat letters centered toward the bottom of the work. Some have seen a white woman, a blond, in that painting and have commented that \\"that old man never saw a blond he didn't adore.\\" This is a gross distortion of reality. Furthermore, if the artist has painted a \\"kitschy bust of a blond [standing] on the balcony just outside the studio of his large, airy, and final home,\\" it is simply to capture with his masterful strokes the \\"clients\\", as he liked to call Americans and others, who have visited him. Unfortunately, he did not paint Mrs. Jackie Onassis or President Léopold Sedar Senghor, or even Alfred Métraux, who paid him a visit in the late 1970s. Those who knew this artist very well, found him to be impenetrable, at times. For example, it was not until after his death that his children discovered in his safe some documentation which stated that he was a commissioned officer—a Captain in the Haitian army before the American Occupation. Philomé Obin always celebrated his birthday with fanfare, saying that on that date—July 20—he almost lost his life during one of the numerous Haitian \\"revolutions.\\" Strapped on a pole, with soldiers in front of him, ready to shoot, he was saved by an officer who came on the scene and had recognized him. The officer ordered the soldiers to release him immediately because, as he put it: \\"Philomé Obin does not get involved in politics!\\" Thus, his birthday was a thanksgiving celebration: \\"I must thank God for sparing my life,\\" he used to say.  Trois Générations  Sometimes called a “sophisticated naif,” Philomé had an imperfect sense of perspective. If his use of perspective was often suspect, Obin's work was always enchanting . His allegories are potent and carry strong messages. One of his paintings, “Trois générations,” illustrates this point very well. In the painting Obin shows three individuals with different types of vestments who represent, each, their own period. He wrote as usual at the center bottom: “Avant l’occupation, durant l’occupation, après l’occupation” [Before, During, and After the American Occupation]. With the last person casually attired in the painting, it is clear that the painter wanted to demonstrate the American influence in Haiti. Although some people have qualified some of his works as \\"static,\\" his craftsmanship is always delicate and precise, and the detail in his works is nothing but astonishing. He avoids the glare. His colors are muted, unlike those of most Haitian painters outside the northern part of the country. In the north itself, Obin's influence was so powerful that subtle coloring is a leading characteristic in the works of hundreds of artists that he himself had trained and many others he hadn't. Among painters of the “Cap- Haitian school,” his brother Sénèque (1896–1972) is also a major talent; several of Philomé's children like Antoine Obin, Télémaque Obin, grandchildren such as Claude Obin, Michaëlle Obin, Henry-Claude Obin, Harisson Obin, Donald Obin, and nephews and nieces are also accomplished painters. In 1919, Obin lived through the “crucifixion” of Charlemagne Péralte, a Haitian patriot who had opposed the American Occupation of Haiti. Betrayed by a friend, whose family name was Conzé, Péralte died in an ambush set by the U.S. Marines. His body was brought to Cap-Haitian, strapped to a door. It was displayed for several days under the hot tropical sun like a trophy in an effort to discourage further resistance. Though Obin hadn't witnessed the “crucifixion,” he honored Péralte as a hero because Charlemagne stood against the American Occupation. His renditions of Péralte's defilement and of his funeral are powerful works that reflect Philomé's nationalist pride. (He painted at least two versions of the “crucifixion,” and his granddaughter, Michaëlle, has painted an allegorical scene showing Obin mourning in front of Péralte's corpse.) The Roman Catholic archbishop's refusal to allow Haitians to adorn his cathedral—a decision he later regretted—resulted in what may be the summit of naif art. The murals by Obin and other artists make Sainte Trinité—the Episcopal Cathedral in Port-au-Prince—one of the highlights of any visit to Haiti. (“Thank God!, they painted Haitians,” the Episcopal bishop exclaimed when he saw the first completed murals.) Philomé labored for many months on his masterpiece, Crucifixion, the centerpiece of three murals that rise above the high altar. Philomé was justifiably proud of what many consider his greatest work. He much disliked Port-au-Prince, however, and rarely visited the Haitian capital after his masterpiece was finished.  Style  At first glance, Obin's work can appear \\"flat\\" or simple. This is due to the use of simple colors and a flat 2-D shape to all the figures drawn. Coeval Magazine writes that his \\"illusion of unsophisticated figurative drawings give way to a precision and detail almost unrecognizable to the naked eye. \\"  Haiti and the American Occupation  Obin repeats the different inscription on many of his works “Avant l’occupation, durant l’occupation, après l’occupation” [Before, During, and After the American Occupation], showing the changing periods of American influence on Haiti and its population.  Late career and death  In the early 1980s, Philomé decided to visit the capitals of Europe, with the United States as his last stop. Passing through New York, he visited some of his old acquaintances. At City College, he was honored by his African American congeners. On that day, Mrs Rosalind Jeffries, of the Museum of Modern Art, talked about him with meritorious and lofty terms. This editor served as his interpreter on that memorable occasion. Before he returned to Haiti, he told this editor that his only regret was that he hadn't taken this trip earlier: \\"I'm too old now, I won't be able to do it again.\\" He died in 1986. Two decades after his death, works by Philomé Obin are sometimes available at galleries in Port-au-Prince, Santo Domingo, Sotheby's in New York, and elsewhere throughout the world, including the Internet. Prices typically range from $40,000 to $100,000 and more. He was arguably the greatest of all Haitian artists—his main rival for that accolade is fellow painter Hector Hyppolite.  Personal life  Obin was married twice. His first wife, the love of his life, Félicia Félix Obin, died early. He had a daughter by her. This child who is now 85 years old (2006) and never knew her mother. Philomé would later divorce his second wife, the mother of Antoine and Gérard Obin. He had children by several other women.

Services offered by Ziebart stores include rustproofing, paint sealant, paint protection film, automobile detailing, window tinting; and the installation of various aftermarket accessories. History The German-born American Kurt Ziebart was the inventor of the rustproofing process for automobiles. It was while working in a Packard body shop in Detroit that Ziebart saw the effects of rust and began looking for a way to protect cars against it. The process he developed is now often called \\"Ziebart-ing\\" or \\"Ziebart-ed\\", a generic term for rustproofing . In 1959, Kurt Ziebart started the Auto Rustproofing Company with two other investors, and opened the first shop bearing the proprietary Ziebart name on Harper Avenue in Detroit. In 1963, he sold his rustproofing company to an investor group. In 1962, Ziebart's first international location was opened in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. In 1963, Kurt Ziebart sold his rustproofing company to an investor group led by Roger Waindle. Waindle also acquired the right to the name Ziebart which he registered with the company's trademark, a helmet and shield design. Waindle also acquired the right to the exclusive tooling designed by Ziebart which he then miniatured for easier processing. He also patented the process. With control of the technical approach, Waindle then developed the franchise package including technical and marketing manuals. The company was renamed Ziebart Auto Truck Rustproofing Company. By 1969, Ziebart (then Ziebart Rustproofing Company) had about 150 franchises in the Midwest of the US and in Canada. As Waindle was interested in selling the company, he hired E.J. Hartmann as Chief Operating Officer. Hartmann was an MBA graduate from the University of Michigan who was recruited from Shatterproof Glass Corporation where he was the company's controller. In 1970, Hartmann acquired the controlling stock of Ziebart and started an aggressive marketing program both in the USA and internationally. In 1973, Ziebart in Hilo Hawaii opened its doors to be the first and the only Ziebart franchise in the Hawaiian Islands. In 1977, Ziebart introduced \\"Zee-Glaze\\", a protective polymer sealant that chemically bonded to cars' paint. In 1979, Ziebart (then Ziebart International Corporation) acquired Arndt Palmer Laboratories, a small chemical manufacturer for car care chemicals in Melvindale, MI. This company was then relocated to Redford, MI, and became the base for Ziebart's manufacturing of its own rustproofing sealant, a wax based petroleum product. By the end of the decade, Ziebart had increased the number of franchised locations worldwide to over 650, while at the same time doubling the retail volume of US franchisees. In 1980, Ziebart began to diversify its business format and its service offerings by including sunroofs, running boards, window tinting and other automotive accessories. All American Motors cars received a new rust-proofing process called \\"Ziebart Factory Rust Protection\\". This included aluminized trim screws, plastic inner fender liners, galvanized steel in every exterior body panel, and a deep-dip bath in an epoxy-based primer. AMC backed up the rust protection program with a 5-year \\"No Rust Thru\\" component to its comprehensive \\"Buyer Protection Plan\\".[11] In 1988, Ziebart acquired the North American franchise rights for its competitor Tuff-Kote Dinol. Tuff-Kote franchisees were subsequently converted to the Ziebart brand. Kurt Ziebart appeared in national television commercials coinciding with his former company's 25th anniversary. In 1989, Ziebart acquired the Tidy Car automotive detailing franchise operation. The brands were merged and over 250 locations became \\"Ziebart Tidy Car\\". In 1990, Ziebart had more than 1,000 locations in 40 countries and more than $100 million in worldwide dealer sales. In 1995, Hartmann sold the ownership to Ziebart International Corporation to an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) led by Thomas Wolfe, the then CFO. Hartman then retired. In 1998, Ziebart entered into a co- branding agreement with Speedy Auto Glass and began offering auto glass replacement in many of its locations. Ziebart has also partnered to co-brand with Rhino Linings USA, which offers polyurethane spray-on liners for truck beds. , there were over 400 Ziebart locations in 30 countries worldwide. In 2014, Ziebart introduced a proprietary paint protection film. Advertising Ziebart grew in large part due to its successful advertising campaigns. *In 1970, corporate advertising started with Ziebart ads appearing in Life, Look, Time, Newsweek and other national magazines. *On radio and television, Don Rondo sang the famous Ziebart jingle, \\"It's Us, Or Rust\\", which was written by Artie Fields. * Actor Malachi Throne was a national television spokesman for Ziebart in several advertising campaigns in the early 1970s. *In 1975, Twilight Zone's Rod Serling was Ziebart's spokesman in a series of television commercials *In 1979, actor Cameron Mitchell became the national spokesman for Ziebart in a series of television commercials that ran for several years. *In 1983, radio personality Russ Gibb was the voice-over on Ziebart rust protection TV spots. *In 1985, Ziebart's first Clio Award-winning TV campaign, \\"Friend of the Family (Rust in Peace)\\", began running with actor Andrew Duggan doing the voice-over. *In 1988, company founder Kurt Ziebart appeared in television commercials coinciding with its 25th Anniversary. *In 1997, Ziebart ran an advertising campaign featuring Batman's Adam West as its spokesman. Ziebart's advertising agencies of record through the years have included Meltzer Aaron & Lemen (San Francisco, CA), Ross Roy (Detroit, MI), Simons Michelson Zieve (Troy, MI) and Doyle Dane Bernbach (New York, NY). Ziebart's public relations agency from 1970 through 1993 was Anthony M. Franco Inc (Detroit, MI).

He wrote classic papers on the birds of the Red Sea, Nigeria, the Gold Coast, Indonesia, Borneo, Ecuador and Iraq. In 1963 he migrated to Australia where he joined the Bureau of Mineral Resources in Canberra. Biography Marchant was born in Weston- under-Lizard, a village in the English county of Shropshire.Davies, Stephen. (2004). Obituary: Stephen Marchant, 1912-2003. Emu 104: 89-90. In Australia, Marchant was immediately involved in organised ornithology through the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union (RAOU) where he was a strong force for what he perceived to be necessary reform. Here he was instrumental in founding the ACT Group of the RAOU, which later became the Canberra Ornithologists Group (COG). He also initiated the RAOU Nest Record Scheme and was a founding member of the RAOU Field Investigations Committee. As part of a reformist makeover of the RAOU, in order to strengthen its scientific rigor and ornithological credibility, in 1968 he became Editor of the RAOU's journal the Emu, which he transformed into an internationally respected scientific journal. Following a 12-year stint as Emu Editor, he turned his attention to a new project, a comprehensive handbook of Australian birds, an endeavour which expanded in scope to become the Handbook of Australian, New Zealand and Antarctic Birds (HANZAB) of which he was the editor-in-chief of the first two volumes. For most of his later years from 1975, he lived at Moruya in the Eurobodalla Shire of the NSW South Coast. Here, he continued to be active in natural history, helping found the Eurobodalla Natural History Society in 1986, serving as its President as well as editor of its journal Nature in Eurobodalla. Stephen Marchant's earlier ornithological work resulted in the award of the British Ornithologists' Union Medal in 1971 and, later, his election as a Corresponding Fellow of the American Ornithologists' Union. Appreciation for his service to the RAOU led to him being elected a Fellow of the RAOU in 1975. His contribution to Australian ornithology was recognised by his being made an Honorary Member in the General Division of the Order of Australia (AM) in 1994, and by being awarded the RAOU's John Hobbs Medal in 1997. Marchant died in August 2003, at a nursing home between the New South Wales towns of Moruya and Narooma. See also *List of ornithologists References *Anon. (1975). RAOU Fellow: Citation.

It flows in a generally northerly direction for about from its source to its confluence with the Tittabawassee River creating the Saginaw River, which drains into the Saginaw Bay of Lake Huron. The name is derived from Chippewa shia-was-see \\"the river straight ahead.\\" Description The Shiawassee watershed is located south and west of Saginaw Bay in Central Michigan. Its basin is shaped like an hourglass, approximately long and wide at each end, and narrows to wide near Corunna. The river rises in Oakland County in Springfield Township at Shiawassee Lake. It is predominately a rural watershed that is dominated by agriculture uses in its lower region and agricultural and rural/small community residential uses upstream. Near its confluence with the Tittabawassee River, within the bounds of the Shiawassee National Wildlife Refuge, the Shiawassee receives the waters of the Bad, Flint, and Cass Rivers. Smaller tributaries of the river include: Denton/North Ore Creek, South Branch Shiawassee, Jones Porter Drain, Beaver Creek, Birch Run Creek, and Swan Creek. It flows through Holly, Fenton, Linden, Corunna, Owosso, and Chesaning. Supporting approximately of watershed environment, there are over 61 species of fish, including darters, minnows, channel catfish, pugnose shiner, greater redhorse, stonecat, river chub and striped shiner. There are also 14 species of freshwater mussel found in the watershed. The swamps and fens adjacent to the river's headwaters support several rare species of plants and animals and play a major role in the travels of migratory waterfowl and shorebirds. Geology The Upper Shiawassee River is bordered by alternating east-west trending moraines, glacial till, and outwash plains. The moraines and outwash plains contain sand and gravel deposits that are more permeable than the fine- grained glacial till and lake clays found in the downstream. The upper half of the watershed has variable (high) relief and is generally well-drained with numerous shallow aquifers that contribute groundwater flow to the headwaters of the Shiawassee River. The Lower Shiawassee is bordered by a low-relief till plain overlain by relatively impermeable and are poorly-drained fine-grained glacial lake clays and relict beach deposits that were deposited over a several thousand-year period when glacial Lake Saginaw covered much of the area, after the most recent retreat of the ice at the end of the Wisconsin glaciation. The present day river bed has eroded into the till plain surface and is now deeply incised, as are the tributary streams and agricultural drains flowing into it. Conservation Shiawassee River clean-up near Bush Park in Fenton, Michigan. HeadWaters Trails Inc. in Holly (Oakland County) promotes the navigability of the river through Fenton towards Lake Ponemah, all the way to Byron, Michigan and the protection of the habitat along the river and in the river to make that experience special. They have cleaned the river as far down as Byron each year. Volunteer crews remove dead falls, and woody debris, which are anchored to the banks for shore protection and fish habitat; and remove garbage to allow canoe/kayak paddling. This will allow paddlers to start in Holly, do a small portage at Fenton dam, and continue on to Lake Ponemah. The more adventuresome can go as far as the dam in Byron. Every year Headwaters Trails hosts an annual Shiawassee River Paddle along the river between Holly and Fenton in June, known as the \\"Adventure Paddle\\". In the October, it hosts \\"Canoeing in Color\\", a time to see migrating birds and the changing of the leaves to brilliant fall colors. These paddles are to raise awareness of the river to the community and help support the efforts of Headwaters Trails to continue making improvements in the form of new places to put in the river as well as signage and fund the purchase of things like steel cables to anchor logs to the banks of the river. They work closely with the communities along the river to promote and conserve that trail as a place where paddle craft can go and where fish habitat is preserved. The number of Kingfishers, Blue Herons and other fishing birds is a tribute to that effort. Other groups that help maintain and conserve the Shiawassee River include local advocates, the Friends of the Shiawassee River, and many others. The Friends of the Shiawassee River is a special interest group and non-profit organization founded in 1996. Their mission is to Care, to maintain and improve the water quality and habitats of the Shiawassee River watershed; Share, to enhance the community’s appreciation and knowledge of the river, especially among youth; and Enjoy, to increase recreational access and responsible use of the Shiawassee River. The Friends also hold an annual river clean-up and conduct invasive species removal workdays. They mainly concern themselves with the part of the river below Walnut Hills campground, on down to Owosso. The Keepers of the Shiawassee are a new group that has grown out of the efforts started by Headwaters Trails, Inc. in Holly that created a paddling trail along the river from Holly to Fenton. The Keepers organize and link volunteers in Genesee County to continue the creation and evolution of a navigable river throughout Michigan. They promote paddling events to create public awareness, such as moonlight and sunrise paddles. These events contribute to the economic well being of the communities served by the Shiawassee River. Headwaters Trails, a 501 (c)(3)non-profit, has received grants to put in a launch in Water Works Park in Holly; put a bridge over the sluice in Water Works Park to make the launch more accessible from the parking lot; put up kiosks and signs that describe historic and natural features of the river, put mile markers along the river and emergency takeout markers; marked the bridges with their names and purchased land for a takeout at Fish Lake Road. They are still attempting to raise money to build that takeout, which will be expensive due to the soil conditions, current lack of parking and the fact that it will need to be handicap accessible. Headwaters Trails Inc. sought and received the designation of Shiawassee River Heritage Water Trail, for the river. This effort was supported by Oakland County Parks, who designed a logo for the trail and helped with creating the art work that describes the historic and natural features of the river. Headwaters Trails hired renowned artist Gayle Vandercook to create the signs on the kiosks. Kristen Wiltfang of Oakland County Parks helped with the colorful graphics of the Saginaw Bay Watershed and descriptions. Several Land Conservation groups, including the North Oakland Headwaters Land Conservancy (NOHLC), the Michigan Nature Association (MNA) and The Nature Conservancy (TNC) have either purchased land or have easements that seek to protect the land from development. This lack of development along the banks of the upper Shiawassee make it one of the least flashy, with regard to floods, in the lower part of the state. It means that as one paddles down the river, mostly you see trees and fields as opposed to houses and lawns and the river does not go into flood stage because a rainstorm came through, making paddling safer than on flashy rivers. It means that habitat for the endangered Blanding's turtle and the fringed gentian, is preserved. More still needs to be done. These efforts are ongoing. NOHLC is currently seeking grants and volunteers to increase the protection of critical breeding habitat for the Blanding's turtle and has been waging war against invasive plants like the Autumn olive tree, the Buckthorn tree, the Multiflora Rose bush, Japanese barberry, Asian Bittersweet, Phragmites, Purple Loosetrife, Garlic Mustard, Swallow-wort and others. These invasives crowd out native plants that are needed by many native species of animals for survival. The decrease in Warblers and other beautiful and colorful native birds, for instance can in many cases be tied to habitat loss exacerbated by the introduction of invasive plants. In many cases, these invasive plants were planted because they have fierce thorns that make impenetrable natural fences or because the flowers or berries are pretty. Each has its own destructive effect. Laws are needed to prevent the sale of these invasives that cannot be kept only on the property of the person who planted them. Shiawassee River Heritage Water Trail Winter canoeing and kayaking upon the Shiawassee River. The Shiawassee River Heritage Water Trail complete with mileage markers and kiosks is open for kayakers and canoeists. Water Works Park at 690 Broad Street in Holly, Michigan (, GPS data: 17T E 285205 N 4740417) is the launch site for the beginning of the trail. Strom Park in (42°47.172′N 83°37.565′W) in Fenton is the take-out point after of paddling. Although this is the official length of the Shiawassee River Heritage Water Trail as it was originally conceived, Headwaters Trails and the communities along the river, Linden, Argentine Township, Holly and Fenton, have extended the trail and the ability to paddle the river all the way to Bryon and are working to create new canoe launches and parks along the river.

Founded in 1847, it is the oldest graduate school in North America, and was the first North American graduate school to confer a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree. The Graduate School is one of twelve constituent schools of Yale University and the only one that awards the degrees of Doctor of Philosophy, Master of Philosophy, Master of Arts, Master of Science, and Master of Engineering. While doctoral programs are also available in five of Yale's professional schools, students are enrolled through the graduate school, which confers their degrees. The school is administered in four divisions—Humanities, Social Sciences, and Biological and Physical Sciences—and its faculty are divided into 52 departments and programs. Nineteen of these programs terminate with the master's degree. The Graduate School enrolls approximately 2,800 students, one-third of whom come from outside the United States. Approximately 900 faculty are involved with the graduate students as teachers, mentors, and advisors. Most of these faculty also teach in Yale College, the undergraduate school of the university. History Second President's House, home to the Department of Philosophy and the Arts, 1847–1860 Established by an act of the Yale Corporation in August 1847, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences was originally called the \\"Department of Philosophy and the Arts\\" and enrolled eleven students who had completed four-year undergraduate degrees. The Department was also the precursor of the Sheffield Scientific School, which was cleaved from the department in 1854. The program offered seminars in chemistry and metallurgy, agricultural science, Greek and Latin literature, mathematics, philology, and Arabic. The faculty consisted of two full-time science professors, chemists Benjamin Silliman, Jr. and John P. Norton, and five Yale College faculty members who offered advanced courses in their subject areas. Following the model of German research universities, the Scientific School faculty established a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1860. At Commencement in July 1861, the school awarded the first three Ph.D.'s in North America to Eugene Schuyler (philosophy and psychology), Arthur Williams Wright (physics), and James Morris Whiton (classics). NYU's School of Practical and Analytical Chemistry, the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard University, and Princeton University established similar programs over the next two decades. In 1892, seven years after Yale organized as a university, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences was officially formed, and Arthur Twining Hadley was appointed dean. Hadley became Yale's 13th president in 1899. In 1920, the Graduate School was assigned its own governing board, and under Dean Wilbur Lucius Cross (1916-1930), it attracted a large and distinguished scholarly faculty. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, race and gender restrictions on graduate admissions were gradually relaxed. In 1876 Edward Alexander Bouchet (Yale B.A. 1874) received a doctorate in Physics, becoming the first African American to earn a Ph.D. in the United States and the sixth recipient of a doctorate in the field. Women were admitted into the Graduate School in 1892. In 1894, seven women received Ph.D.s from Yale, including Mary Augusta Scott (English), Laura Johnson Wylie (English), Elizabeth Deering Hanscom (English), Margaretta Palmer (Mathematics), Charlotte Fitch Roberts (Chemistry), and sisters Cornelia H. B. Rogers (Romance Languages and Literatures) and Sara Bulkley Rogers (History). MacDougal Center in the Hall of Graduate Studies A Hall of Graduate Studies for the school was completed in 1932, giving the school its first centralized home. In 1996, the McDougal Graduate Student Center was established in the Hall of Graduate Studies. It now has professional staff to head offices of Teaching Fellow Preparation and Development, Graduate Career Services, and Student Affairs. The Graduate Student Assembly was established in 1997. Organization Faculty and administration Most Graduate School faculty are members of the Yale Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the largest faculty of the university's schools and the same faculty body that governs the Yale College curriculum. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences is organized into 40 departments, which administer the Graduate School's four divisions: Humanities, Social Sciences, Biological Sciences, and Physical Sciences. Some members of Yale's professional school faculties are also members of the Graduate School faculty, which permits them to advise doctoral candidates. A Dean of the Graduate School, appointed by the Yale Corporation, is the school's chief administrator. The position is currently held by geneticist Lynn Cooley. Degree programs The Graduate School administers 75 degree-granting programs. 56 of these programs grant Ph.D.s., while 19 terminate in master's degrees. It also offers joint-degree programs with several of Yale's professional schools, as well as opportunities for advanced non-degree study. Facilities The Hall of Graduate Studies (HGS) The Hall of Graduate Studies The Hall of Graduate Studies, locally known as HGS, was built between 1930 and 1932. Designed by James Gamble Rogers, the building is in the Collegiate Gothic style, with whimsical and emblematic decorative details, stained glass windows, and ornamented ceilings. The building contains the offices of the Graduate School administration, several academic departments, the McDougal Student Center, a dining hall, and a residential tower for graduate students. In addition to the school's administrative offices, the Hall of Graduate Studies hosts the Department of American Studies, History, Near Eastern Languages & Civilizations, and Slavic Languages & Literature. Other arts and humanities departments are located around Yale's Old Campus. Research facilities Yale's facilities for research and study include a university library system of nearly fifteen million volumes, the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, the Yale University Art Gallery, the Yale Center for British Art, the Office of Information Technology Services, departmental libraries and collections, and the extensive resources of the professional schools. The collections and services of the Research Libraries Group, which consists of Columbia, Harvard, and Yale universities and the New York Public Library, are also available to students. Special research facilities for the sciences are clustered on Science Hill, including the Bass Center for Molecular and Structural Biology, Josiah Willard Gibbs Research Laboratories, Kline Geology Laboratory, Sterling Chemistry Laboratory, Kline Biology Tower, the Class of 1954 Environmental Science Center, the Peabody Museum of Natural History, and the Arthur W. Wright Nuclear Structure Laboratory. Becton Engineering and Applied Science Center and Arthur K. Watson Hall for computer science are located on the former campus of the Sheffield Scientific School. Other laboratory facilities, like the Boyer Center for Molecular Medicine, are found at the Yale School of Medicine and the university's West Campus. Office of International Affairs The Office of International Affairs serves as an administrative resource to support the international activities of all schools, departments, offices, centers, and organizations at Yale. It tries to promote Yale and its faculty to international audiences and increase the visibility of Yale's international activities around the globe. The McDougal Graduate Student Center Mr. Alfred McDougal ’53, a Yale alumnus, and his wife, Ms. Nancy Lauter, enabled Yale to create the McDougal Graduate Student Center in 1997. The McDougal Center is housed in HGS, comprising a popular Common Room (and student-run Blue Dog Cafe), the Student Life Center, the Graduate Teaching Center, Graduate Career Services, the Dossier Service, and a Resource Library.

His album Truths and Rights was a roots reggae success, and featured \\"Jah Promise\\" and the album's title track, \\"Truths and Rights\\". Johnny also enjoyed big hits with covers of U.S. soul tunes like \\"Ready Or Not\\" and Earth Wind and Fire's \\"Reasons\\". In addition, he has had many songs with the phrase Rub A Dub in the title, the most acclaimed of these is to the Rub A Dub Session. Osbourne is also the most in-demand vocalist for dubplates due to the amount of dancehall classics he has had. This has resulted in the nickname Dancehall Godfather. He is probably best known for his mid-1980s dancehall reggae hits \\"Buddy Bye\\" (based on King Jammy's Sleng Teng riddim), \\"Ice Cream Love\\" and \\"Water Pumping\\". Career Johnny Osbourne attended the Alpha Boys School, an orphanage in Kingston, Jamaica that also was home to Yellowman, founding members of the Skatalites, Leroy Smart and Leroy Horsemouth Wallace as well as Jazz men Dizzy Reece and Joe Harriott. During 1967 Osbourne became lead vocalist of The Wildcats, and recorded for producer Winston Riley, although nothing was issued. The Wildcats' manager then financed a session at Coxsone Dodd's Studio One, from which his debut single, \\"All I Have Is Love\\", was released. In 1969 he recorded an album, Come Back Darling, again for Riley. On the day that he completed the album, Osbourne emigrated to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, to join his family. After singing with various soul and reggae groups, he became lead vocalist for Ishan People, and recorded two albums with them. The group broke up in 1979, and Osbourne decided to return to Jamaica. Shortly after returning, he recorded \\"Forgive Them\\" and \\"Jealousy, Heartache And Pain\\" for the Studio One label. Through late 1979 and early 1980 he recorded extensively for Dodd, with these sessions culminating in Truths And Rights. In 1979 he also had a hit for King Jammy (then Prince Jammy) with \\"Folly Ranking\\", and an album of the same name followed in 1980. The success of these recordings made him one of the most in- demand vocalists on the island, and a glut of material was released, including Fally Lover, Warrior, Innah Disco Style and Never Stop Fighting, between 1980 and 1982. In 1983, he began the year with two big hits, \\"Yo Yo\\" and \\"Lend Me A Chopper\\", and later in the year enjoyed further success with \\"Water Pumping\\", an adaptation of Hopeton Lewis' \\"Take It Easy\\", which had also served as the basis for Johnny Clarke's 1976 hit \\"Rockers Time Now\\". The hits continued with \\"Get Cracking\\", \\"Check For You\\", \\"Rewind\\" (1984), \\"Buddy Bye\\", \\"No Sound Like We\\" and \\"In The Area\\" (1985). In the late 1980s he was particularly successful when recording for Bobby Digital, and had hits with \\"Good Time Rock\\" (1988) and \\"Rude Boy Skank\\" (1988), both of which are included on his 1989 album, Rougher Than Them. Throughout the 1980s he continued to record for Coxsone Dodd, and singles included \\"Keep That Light\\", \\"Unity\\" and \\"A We Run Things\\", but a long-promised second album from Dodd has not materialized. In 2012, his track \\"Mr. Marshall\\" was sampled in Major Lazer's single \\"Jah No Partial\\".

A specialist in Latin American affairs, he served as United States Ambassador to Cuba from February 1959 until October 1960, the first months of the Castro regime. Early years He was born in New York City in 1903. His father was Stephen Bonsal (1865–1951), a well-known journalist who served several years in the US diplomatic corps, wrote several books, and won a Pulitzer Prize. The Bonsals descended from English Quakers who participated in founding the colony of Pennsylvania in 1682. His mother was Henrietta Morris, a descendant of Gouverneur Morris, a leader in the American Revolution. He had three brothers, including New York judge Dudley Baldwin Bonsal. Bonsal's early education took place in the Philippines and Switzerland. He graduated from Yale in 1924. He married Margaret Lockett of Knoxville, Tennessee, circa 1929. After living in Cuba for several months as a student trainee with the Cuban Telephone Company, Bonsal worked in Spain and Chile for its parent company, International Telephone & Telegraph, rising to become chief of its Latin American Division. He then entered government service as a specialist in telephone services with the Federal Communications Commission, where he remained from 1935 to 1937. He was fluent in Spanish. Diplomatic service Bonsal joined the State Department in 1937. He was Vice Consul and Third Secretary in the US embassy in Havana in 1938 and 1939, followed by a year in Washington as Cuban desk officer at the State Department. While on the staff of the US embassy in Bolivia in 1944, he tried without success to persuade the State Department to ignore the rhetoric of Bolivia's radical opposition parties, which he excused as reflexive opposition to the recently ousted pro-American regime of Enrique Peñaranda. He told Secretary of State Cordell Hull that the Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario (MNR) embodied the \\"legitimate and respectable... aspirations of certain sectors of the Bolivian people.\\" Instead, the US forced President Gualberto Villarroel to remove members of the MNR from his cabinet. He served as an adviser at the 1954 Geneva Conference on Korea and Indochina. Colombia Eisenhower nominated Bonsal as United States Ambassador to Colombia in February 1955. The US Senate confirmed the appointment on February 11, and he presented his credentials on April 1. He maintained friendly relations with opposition politicians, angering Colombian dictator General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, who persuaded the State Department to reassign him. In January 1957, representing the US at the United Nations General Assembly's Special Political Committee, he supported a Philippine proposal, endorsed by representatives of Peru, Nepal, and other nations, for the UN to modify its confrontational approach in fighting apartheid in South Africa and to shift to tactics that would promote discussion and recognize the problem of racial discrimination in other countries as well. Eisenhower nominated him as United States Ambassador to Bolivia on March 18, 1957. He concluded his service in Colombia on April 24, 1957. Bolivia Bonsal served as United States Ambassador to Bolivia from 1957 to 1959. He wholeheartedly supported the US economic assistance program under way there, which he later described as a \\"pioneer\\" and \\"solitary example\\" of what was required of the US in Latin America. Cuba In January 1959, Eisenhower named Bonsal United States Ambassador to Cuba just days after Fidel Castro came to power. The New York Times called his appointment \\"a splendid choice\\" and described him as \\"a distinguished career diplomat\\" with \\"every qualification that could be asked for the difficult and gratifying task he is taking on.\\" Bonsal's predecessor, Earl E. T. Smith, had maintained friendly relations with Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista and was quickly recalled by the State Department after Batista's ouster. It has been argued that the choice of Bonsal signaled an intention on the part of the State Department to defuse the Cuban Revolution in the same way that it had defused the Bolivian Revolution of 1952. Bonsal attempted to find a working arrangement with the leader of the new government. Bonsal admitted that \\"animosity was inevitable\\" but that he was hopeful that \\"at some point we can get down to a reasoned dialogue.\\"Diplomat Recalls Cuba Break in 1961 Wayne Smith Library of Congress country notes According to reports Castro was critical of the arrival of Bonsal in the Cuban press and compared him to a colonial viceroy,Cuba: The United States and Batista, 1952-58 Hugh Thomas and dialogue was not easily forthcoming. When Bonsal testified before a closed session of the House Committee on Foreign Relations in May 1959, he explained why the revolution had such widespread popular support: \\"the corruption and the sadism of many Batista henchmen united most Cubans against the regime.\\" He described how Batista's security forces had killed many while \\"many, many more were arrested on no charges and kept in jail for indefinite periods.\\" In August, he protested to Secretary of State Herter that Cuban-American relations were being poisoned by the fact that the US was allowing several hundred Batista allies to live in the country, which appeared to the Cubans as harboring counter-revolutionaries. He urged them to be forced to \\"move on to some other country.\\" On September 3, 1959, Bonsal met with Castro and express concern that American businesses, which had complied fully with the Land Reform Law, were concerned that government agents were acting arbitrarily and without legal sanction. He complained of anti-American comments by Guevara, who was then on a world tour. Castro advised patience and forbearance with \\"the exuberances of young and inexperienced revolutionaries.\\" In October 1959, Castro called the US \\"accomplices\\" of Batista loyalists forces who had launched air attacks on Cuba. Bonsal lodged a formal protest with Cuban President Osvaldo Dorticóson October 27 and blamed Castro for the deterioration of relations. In mid-1960, the Cuban government reached an agreement to sell 700,000 tons of sugar to the Soviet Union, leading to a series of escalating actions by the US and Cuba. The US suspended sugar imports, Cuba nationalized American-owned businesses, and on October 19, the US imposed an embargo on US exports to Cuba except for food and medicine. Bonsal thought the Eisenhower administration was over-reacting and forcing Castro into an alliance with the Soviets. After the Castro called for a reduction in the staff of the US embassy in Havana, Bonsal was recalled to Washington in October 1960. Formal diplomatic relations between the two countries were severed shortly afterward, and US diplomatic representation in Cuba was handled by the United States Interests Section in Havana, part of the embassy of Switzerland. That arrangement lasted until July 20, 2015, with the culmination of the Cuban Thaw. Some leading members of the US Congress felt his attempt at a conciliatory approach to the Castro regime represented an appeasement of communism. Morocco Bonsal was United States Ambassador to Morocco from 1961 to 1962. He retired from government service in 1965. Later years As of 1971, he called for \\"disengagement from a bankrupt Vietnam policy\\" by noting that China and Russia had invested comparatively modest resources in the conflict, compared to the American loss of 40,000 lives. He hoped that all the major powers would nevertheless recognize that \\"big-power confrontation by proxy is so repulsively destructive of the welfare of the proxies as to render its repetition elsewhere inconceivable\\". He also described the Pentagon Papers as \\"stolen property\\" and objected to those who ignored the violation of government secrecy standards because the revelations supported their political judgment. Bonsal published a memoir, \\"Cuba, Castro and the United States,\\" in 1971. He died of pneumonia in 1995 and was survived by his wife. His papers are held by the Library of Congress.

Robinson, and starring Robin Williams. The film also features Christopher Walken, Laura Linney, Lewis Black, and Jeff Goldblum. In the film Williams portrays Tom Dobbs, the host of a comedy/political talk show, based loosely on the real-life persona of Jon Stewart. With an offhand remark, he prompts four million people to e-mail their support; then he decides to campaign for President. The film was released theatrically on October 13, 2006, and was filmed in Toronto and Hamilton, Ontario, and in parts of Washington, D.C. Man of the Year received mostly negative reviews and earned $41.2 million on a $20 million budget. Plot Tom Dobbs is host of a satirical news program, tapping into public frustrations with divisive, special interest-driven politics. Dobbs laughs off an audience suggestion that he run for president, but following online support, he announces his campaign on air. He gets on the ballot in 13 states and participates in a national debate with the Democratic incumbent, President Kellogg, and Republican candidate Senator Mills. Eleanor Green works at the Delacroy voting machine company, which will provide machines for the Presidential election. Shortly before the elections, Eleanor notices that the voting system does not work correctly and alerts the head of the company, James Hemmings, via an e-mail that he deletes. Dobbs takes the campaign a bit too seriously, to the chagrin of his manager, Jack Menken, and his show's producer, Eddie Langston. The night of the presidential debates, fed up with the other candidates' posturing, Dobbs shifts back into comedy, keeping the audience laughing while making serious points. He continues his showman persona on the campaign trail, shaking up the political landscape and surging in the polls, but remains well behind Kellogg and Mills. On Election Day, early returns show Kellogg beating Mills everywhere, exactly as Eleanor predicted the voting system would report. Dobbs sweeps the 13 states in which he is on the ballot, taking enough electoral votes to be elected president. When Eleanor confronts Hemmings about the Delacroy computer error, senior executive Stewart turns her aside. While Dobbs and his team move from shock to celebration, Eleanor is attacked in her home and given an injection. The next day, she displays erratic behavior and is sent to the hospital, where tests reveal high levels of illegal drugs. Her workmate Danny visits and reveals he has been promoted, which she thinks is an effort to buy him off. He tries to convince her that she has a drug habit and that no one will listen if she goes public, but she decides that Dobbs will believe her. Traveling to Washington and impersonating an FBI agent, Eleanor explains to Dobbs that she was recently fired by Delecroy, but he is pulled away before she can explain the election results. Dobbs tries to contact Eleanor by calling Delacroy's headquarters, and Hemmings explains Eleanor was fired due to a drug problem. Eleanor figures out the flaw in Delacroy's system – no matter the actual results, the system declares the winner as the name with double letters, in alphabetical order, so that Do’’bb’’s beats Kello’’gg’’, which beats Mi’’ll’’s. Eleanor calls Dobbs and he whisks her off to a Thanksgiving celebration with his friends. Smitten with her, he says he already knows about her drug problem, which she denies and tells him that the election result was wrong before leaving. Dobbs calls Eleanor, telling her that he will break the news the next day. She calls Danny, who informs Stewart, who preempts Dobbs' public announcement by announcing that Eleanor was caught attempting to manipulate the election for Dobbs but that her efforts had no impact on the polls. Dobbs' team turns against Eleanor, except for Dobbs. Eleanor becomes increasingly concerned for her safety, and sees Delacroy agents break into her motel room and take her computer. She flees to a crowded mall, but is followed and apprehended by a Delacroy agent. She escapes and calls Dobbs from a pay phone, but another Delacroy agent drives his truck into the phone booth. Dobbs goes to the scene and talks with the injured Eleanor in her ambulance, where she convinces him of the truth. Dobbs’ friends encourage him to remain president, with polls showing that 60% of the nation wants him in office. That night, invited onto the Weekend Update segment of Saturday Night Live, Dobbs announces that the Delacroy vote system was flawed, that Eleanor told her bosses but they covered it up and silenced her, and that he will not run in the new election that must now take place. President Kellogg wins a second term, Dobbs returns to hosting his satirical news program, with Eleanor as his producer and later his wife, and the Delacroy executives are arrested. TIME magazine chooses Dobbs as Person of the Year.

It grossed $37.3 million in North America and $3.9 million in other territories for a total worldwide gross of $41.2 million. Universal Pictures Home Entertainment released it on DVD on February 20, 2007, where it grossed another $25.1 million in sales. Reception Man of the Year received mostly negative reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 22% based on reviews from 143 critics. The site's consensus states: \\"Weakened by second-half attempts at thriller and romance, this presidential comedy also fails to hit any sharp political notes, resulting in a confused and unsatisfying mess.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 39% based on reviews from 30 critics. Most of the critics noted the abrupt change in tone from comedy to conspiracy film. Many critics rated the entire movie negatively, calling the early humor of the film uninspired and less biting than that of the real-life television comedians Dobbs was modeled after (such as Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert); others argued that the early political humor of the film was both funny and on-target, but argued that the change in tone to a conspiracy film damaged its effectiveness, and many criticized the love story aspect between Williams and Linney. Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com wrote, \\"It's a comedy, a political thriller, a love story: Barry Levinson's Man of the Year tries to be all things to all people and fails on every count – a little like the generic, ineffectual politicians it's pretending to excoriate\\". James Berardinelli of ReelViews felt it \\"makes telling points and has a lot to say, but it loses its voice along with its consistency around the mid-way point\\". Josh Larsen of the Sun Publications line of newspapers asked straight out, \\"What is it about Robin Williams that he often appears in these wild misfires, pictures that are so full of promise yet so disastrous in execution?\\"The Bolingbrook [Illinois Sun review, by Josh Larsen] Frank Lovece of Film Journal International placed the well-regarded Levinson's challenge and failure within a larger context: \\"If satire is what dies on a Saturday night, then political-satire movies are what die on Fridays. Maybe we're used to the TV topicality of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart or Real Time with Bill Maher, whereas movies are months in the making, turning their current events into history. Yet successful satire needn't be topical – witness Network, Election, Dr. Strangelove – because some verities are timeless. Since when, after all, hasn't there been a populist saying, 'Throw the rascals out'?\\" The film debuted at #3 at the box office its opening weekend, with a theatrical gross of $12,550,000. The film would later be seen as prescient, with the election of TV comedians to the presidency of both Guatemala (Jimmy Morales in 2017) and Ukraine (Volodymyr Zelensky in 2019).

It was created as a stand-alone single to promote the compilation album Decade: Greatest Hits. However, its music video was included on the band's audiovisual compilation Greatest, released in 1999 (VHS) and 2003 (DVD). The song is essentially a megamix of Duran Duran's history, featuring tidbits of all of the band's hits of the previous ten years. Composition Instrumental elements of \\"Save A Prayer\\", \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\", \\"Rio\\", \\"The Reflex\\" and \\"The Wild Boys\\", including the camera sound from \\"Girls on Film\\", form the core of the first part of the song, while the \\"chorus\\" is built up of alternating chants of \\"Girls!\\" (from \\"Girls on Film\\") and \\"Boys!\\" (from \\"The Wild Boys\\"). The nonsense syllables from several songs, such as the \\"noh-noh\\" bits from \\"Notorious\\", the \\"bop bop bop\\" from \\"Planet Earth\\" and the \\"tana nana\\" and the \\"fle fle fle fle flex\\" from \\"The Reflex\\", were also incorporated. Elements from \\"A View To A Kill\\", \\"Notorious\\", \\"I Don't Want Your Love\\" and later singles are gradually woven into the mix. Segments of the song are marked by signature phrases taken from other songs: first, \\"Can you hear me now?\\" (\\"Planet Earth\\"); later, \\"I tell you, somebody's fooling around\\" (\\"The Reflex\\") and \\"The rhythm is the power\\" (\\"I Don't Want Your Love\\"). The title derives from a \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\" lyric. The song also used several sound samples from the film Barbarella, from which the band took their name: \\"Barbarella?\\" \\"Mr. President!\\" \\"Your Mission, find Durand Durand!\\" \\"Just a minute, I'll slip something on!\\" The remix was created by producer John Jones, with assistance from Dee Long and engineer Chris Potter, in an upstairs room at Olympic Studios in Barnes while Duran Duran was downstairs recording new material for the album Liberty, to be released the following year.John Jones biography Music video The video for \\"Burning The Ground\\", much like the song, used snippets of many of Duran Duran's previous audiovisual work, including scenes from their 1985 concert film Arena (An Absurd Notion) and their 1987-1989 Strange Behaviour & Electric Theatre world tours. The video also used footage of burning South American rainforests, as well as the NASA space shuttles and even some scenes of the band walking around during their recording sessions for their upcoming Liberty album. It was directed by Adrian Martin.Rolling Stone: Burning the Ground music video (requires RealPlayer) B-sides, bonus tracks and remixes The b-side was another megamix, this one more instrumental in nature, called \\"Decadance\\". The song uses the \\"why\\" bits of \\"The Reflex\\", the \\"no, no\\" from \\"Notorious\\", \\"wild\\" from \\"The Wild Boys\\", the chorus from \\"All She Wants Is\\", the solo from \\"Save a Prayer\\" mixed with \\"Rio\\", and a little bit of \\"Skin Trade\\", as well as some of the suggestive screams from \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\".

Individuals are identified, and the network is tuned to respond to their presence by context. The OSI model provides a method to deliver network traffic, not only to the system but to the application that requested or is listening for data. These applications can operate either as a system based user-daemon process, or they may be a user application such as a web browser. Internet security is built around the idea that the ability to request or respond to requests should be subjected to some degree of authentication, validation, authorization, and policy enforcement. Identity driven networking endeavors to resolve user and system based policy into a single management paradigm. Since the internet comprises a vast range of devices and applications there are also many boundaries and therefore ideas on how to resolve connectivity to users within those boundaries. An endeavor to overlay the system with an identity framework must first decide what an Identity is, determine it, and only then use existing controls to decide what is intended with this new information. The Identity A digital identity represents the connectedness between the real and some projection of an identity; and it may incorporate references to devices as well as resources and policies. In some systems, policies provide the entitlements that an identity can claim at any particular point in time and space. For example, a person may be entitled to some privileges during work from their workplace that may be denied from home out of hours. How it might work Before a user gets to the network there is usually some form of machine authentication, this probably verifies and configures the system for some basic level of access. Short of mapping a user to a MAC address prior or during this process (802.1x) it is not simple to have users authenticate at this point. It is more usual for a user to attempt to authenticate once the system processes (daemons) are started, and this may well require the network configuration to have already been performed. It follows that, in principle, the network identity of a device should be established before permitting network connectivity, for example by using digital certificates in place of hardware addresses which are trivial to spoof as device identifiers. Furthermore, a consistent identity model has to account for typical network devices such as routers and switches which can't depend on user identity, since no distinctive user is associated with the device. Absent this capability in practice, however, strong identity is not asserted at the network level. The first task when seeking to apply Identity Driven Network controls comprises some form of authentication, if not at the device level then further up the stack. Since the first piece of infrastructure placed upon a network is often a network operating system (NOS) there will often be an Identity Authority that controls the resources that the NOS contains (usually printers and file shares). There will also be procedures to authenticate users onto it. Incorporating some form of single sign-on means that the flow on effect to other controls can be seamless. Many network capabilities can be made to rely upon authentication technologies for the provisioning of an access control policy. For instance; Packet filtering -firewall, content- control software, Quota Management systems and Quality of service (QoS) systems are good examples of where controls can be made dependent upon authentication.

Drummond-Grant began her career as a soprano. She joined D'Oyly Carte in 1933, but was considered by the company's management as too tall to be an ideal performer of the Savoy Operas' young soprano heroines, and left the company in 1938. During World War II she toured in a variety of theatrical shows. She married the D'Oyly Carte musical director, Isidore Godfrey, in 1940, and returned to the company in 1950 as a contralto, playing Gilbert's formidable older women, until shortly before her death at the age of 54. Life and career Drummond-Grant was born in Edinburgh and studied singing in Scotland. She sang for five years as leading soprano in a parish church, played in small opera and musical comedy troupes, and did some concert work and broadcasting.The Times, 18 July 1927, p. 23 and 7 July 1933, p. 20; and The Manchester Guardian, 20 October 1932, p. 10Stone, David. \\"Ann Drummond-Grant\\", Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Company, accessed 28 December 2009 Soprano years In 1933, Drummond-Grant joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company chorus.Rollins and Witts, p. 157 In 1936 she began to play the small parts of Celia in Iolanthe, Zorah in Ruddigore, and Fiametta in The Gondoliers. She soon moved up to the larger roles of Plaintiff in Trial by Jury and Lady Psyche in Princess Ida, and she also made occasional appearances in the leading soprano roles of Josephine in H.M.S. Pinafore, the title roles in Patience and Princess Ida, and Gianetta in The Gondoliers.Rollins and Witts, p. 160 In 1937, Drummond-Grant became one of D'Oyly Carte's principal sopranos.

She was selected to play Aline when The Sorcerer was revived in 1938.Rollins and Witts, p. 162. She won excellent reviews for her performances. Of her Ida, The Manchester Guardian wrote, \\"Miss Ann Drummond-Grant sang and acted the heroine's part as finely as any of her predecessors that we can remember.\\" The paper also praised her as Patience and Elsie.The Manchester Guardian, 3 November 1937. p. 11 (Ida); 28 October 1937, p. 11 (Patience); and 9 November 1937, p. 13 (Elsie) However, the company was hiring new sopranos, including Helen Roberts, and Drummond-Grant lost roles or had to share them. The Times later wrote, \\"Being strikingly tall and well- built, she was judged to be not quite fitted for the leading soprano parts.\\"The Times, obituary, 12 September 1959, p. 8 Seeing herself sidelined, she left the company at the end of 1938.Rollins and Witts, p. 163 Drummond- Grant married the D'Oyly Carte musical director, Isidore Godfrey, in 1940.

Recherches sur Diderot et sur l'Encyclopédie. 1989, Volume 7, Numéro 7, S. 138 He was a prominent figure in what became known as the Enlightenment, and contributed to Diderot's Encyclopédie. After his death, Jacques-Philippe-Augustin Douchet and Nicolas Beauzée, who were both teachers at the École royale militaire, took over his work. Born in Marseille, Dumarsais trained in Paris as a lawyer, before abandoning the bar to pursue the life of the mind, subsisting on occasional law students and later on the meager revenue from a pension in the city's Faubourg-Saint Victor. He wrote clandestine tracts in favour of freethought, attacked the French church in books and pamphlets, and proposed, to no avail, a reform of French orthography. He died infirm; in the words of a eulogy penned for the Encyclopédie by D'Alembert, \\"he lived poor and ignored by the fatherland he had taught\\". Principal works include Méthode raisonné pour apprendre la langue latine (1722) and Principes de grammaire (1769).

It is known as \\"direct\\" traffic control because the train dispatcher gives track authority directly to the train crew via radio, as opposed to through wayside personnel via telephone or telegraph, as in train orders. Layout A DTC block sign for the Luthman block on the Alaska Railroad. In DTC, controlled tracks and sidings (those requiring authority from the train dispatcher to occupy) are divided into pre-specified blocks. In addition to being listed by milepost in the railroad's timetable, block limits are delineated by conspicuous signs along the tracks. Every portion of controlled track belongs to a block, as blocks are laid out back-to-back along the entire length of the rail line. For example, a length of main line track may be divided into three blocks, Anna, Bess, and Cloy, each long. At milepost 10, there will be a sign displaying the end of Anna block and the beginning of Bess block, and a similar sign between Bess and Cloy. A train authorized in Anna through Bess blocks must stop before Bess block ends and Cloy block begins. For example, a length of track may consist of three blocks. Anna, Bess, and Cloy. There is a siding at Bess, and this siding is specified as Bess Siding. Both Bess and Bess Siding blocks extend to the switches at either end of the siding. Anna and Cloy blocks begin on the other side of their respective switches. Neither Bess nor Bess Siding blocks may be occupied without authority from the train dispatcher. In this example, a train may have authority straight through from Anna through Cloy. Or, it could have authority in Anna through Bess Siding, in which case it must throw the switch between Anna and Bess and enter the siding - this will usually be done to clear the main track for an opposing train to pass. After clearing its authority in Anna siding and the opposing train passes, it might then get authority from Bess Siding through Cloy, in which case it will throw the switch between Bess and Cloy and reenter the main track. Lengths of DTC blocks vary, but usually take about 10 minutes to traverse. The siding itself is not considered a DTC block per se, but in some situations sidings must not be occupied without authority from the train dispatcher. However, in DTC territory all sidings operate as non-controlled, restricted speed track and there is no safety consideration in a train occupying it without central authority to do so. For traffic flow purposes the dispatcher needs to record which sidings are occupied. If a train could not use the main track in Bess (due to maintenance, a stuck switch, a disabled train, or an obstacle blocking the track), it would also be possible for the train to have authority from Anna through Bess Siding through Cloy. This is not done when the main track is available, as there is a speed disadvantage to having the train traverse the slower siding track (including having to stop to throw the switches to enter the siding). While most DTC blocks are laid out back-to-back, the blocks actually do not touch at sidings. Instead, there is a \\"gray area\\" over the siding's switches, and the main track's and siding's DTC blocks begins at approximately the clearance point of the switch. The area over the switch must not be occupied unless authority is granted in blocks on both sides of the switch. For example, a train authorized only in Anna block must stop at the End Anna Block sign, which is a short distance from the switch points. A train authorized in Anna through Bess or in Anna through Bess Siding may proceed past the End Anna Block sign, over the switch, and then past the Begin Bess (or Bess Siding, as applicable) Block sign. Blocks are typically named after a distinguishing feature within the block, such as a station, town, or river. Procedures Normally, only one train or piece of equipment may occupy a given block at a time, and a train must release their authority in a block for the dispatcher to authorize another train into that block. Barring human error, this ensures that no two trains are ever authorized on any given piece of track at the same time, thereby preventing collisions. (In certain circumstances, dispatchers will authorize more than one piece of equipment—as in the case of track maintenance vehicles—into the same block. When this occurs, the authority is marked as \\"joint,\\" and all movements must be made at restricted speed, which allows stopping within half the range of vision.) Another key feature of DTC is that only one authority is in effect for any given train at any given time. When a dispatcher issues a new authority to a train, the previous authority becomes invalid and must not be used. In modern implementations, dispatchers rely on computerized systems to monitor trains that have received authority. Typically, the computer will prevent the dispatcher from giving two trains authority over the same track. The computer system generally displays a highly simplified diagram of the track, displaying the block limits and sidings. Track occupancy is displayed via bold or colored lines overlaying the track display, along with tags to identify the train (usually the number of the lead locomotive). To receive or change a train's authority, the train dispatcher communicates by radio with the train crew and gives \\"mandatory directives\\" authorizing occupancy in a specified number of blocks. A member of the train crew, usually the conductor, copies the dispatcher's mandatory directive onto a prescribed form. The crew member will repeat the directive back to the dispatcher, who monitors the repeat for any errors. If the crew member correctly repeats the mandatory directive, the dispatcher finalizes the directive by saying, \\"That is correct,\\" followed by the dispatcher's initials. A mandatory directive cannot take effect until the dispatcher has said, \\"That is correct,\\" reducing the potential for human error to cause an accident. Numbers are always repeated in an alternate format to ensure clarity and prevent misunderstandings. Numbers from zero to nine are spelled out, while numbers greater than ten are given by their individual numerals. For example, the number six would be given as, \\"Six, s-i-x,\\" while the number 14 would be given as \\"fourteen, one-four.\\" Engine numbers such as 2001 are usually read first as \\"two thousand one,\\" while numbers such as 4321 are usually read as \\"forty-three twenty-one,\\" although this is mostly a personal preference about what is easiest to say. Regardless, the repeat will give the individual numerals, as in, \\"Engine twenty-eight oh eight, two, eight, zero, eight.\\" A sample issue format would be as follows: When trains must meet en route, one train must be authorized into the siding. For example, train 5432 may be authorized from Anna into Bess Siding: An opposing train will be authorized in two blocks, Cloy through Bess, using a similar format: Once train 5432 has fully entered the siding and restored the switch for movement along the main track, they will call the dispatcher and release Anna block, using the following format: After the 5432 has released its authority in Anna, the dispatcher may issue a new authority to the 4321 authorizing them through Anna block. Since only one authority is valid at any given time, if the 4321 is still in Cloy block, the dispatcher will give the new authority containing Cloy through Anna. Once the 4321 is fully within the Bess block and has cleared Cloy block, the conductor or other crew member will call the dispatcher and release Cloy. The dispatcher will then issue a new authority to the 5432, giving them authority from Bess Siding block through Cloy block. This generates additional radio traffic but ensures that there is no confusion as to which train is allowed to enter a given block at any given time. Some railroads have instituted a practice which allows a train to enter a block contingent upon the passing of the opposing train, although the National Transportation Safety Board has recommended against this practice. A DTC authority given under this practice will include a phrase such as \\"This line is not in effect until after the arrival of train 7940.\\" In the case of two trains traveling the same direction, the dispatcher will only authorize the following train in blocks that the leading train has released. In the case of closely spaced trains, the dispatcher may opt to reduce his or her workload and implement a \\"radio blocking behind\\" authority, which lets the two trains talk to each other directly to discuss which blocks the leading train has cleared. Caution must be exercised by the leading train not to release authority on track that the train still occupies, as this could result in a rear-end collision if the leading train slows down or stops or if the train becomes separated and a portion is left standing on the main track. Entering a block in which the train is not authorized or releasing a block which the train still occupies is considered a main-line violation by the Federal Railroad Administration and carries stiff penalties for all crew members, which may include time off from work and the suspension or revocation of the engineer's license. Use The Southern Pacific Railroad, now the Union Pacific, implemented DTC on several of its lines formerly controlled by train orders (most of the rest of UP's lines use Centralized Traffic Control). The BNSF Railway does not use DTC; it uses mostly CTC with track warrants in its non-signalled territory. The Alaska Railroad changed its Track Warrant Control territory to DTC and is also implementing CTC in high-traffic areas. Queensland Rail in Australia uses the DTC system in some of the lower traffic areas in the western area of the state. CSX uses DTC on their former Georgia railroad mainline from Scottdale, just east of Atlanta, to Augusta.

He was a member of the Scottish band Simple Minds from 1978, recording their early demos, until shortly after their 1985 hit, \\"Don't You (Forget About Me)\\". Career A former member of the Scottish punk band Subs, Forbes replaced Tony Donald as bassist for Simple Minds in 1978, leaving in 1985. He reunited with the band for a three-year period from 1995 to 1998, before and during the recording of Néapolis. He and Mel Gaynor also appeared at Scotland Rocks for Kosovo in 1999 performing Led Zeppelin's \\"Kashmir\\", whilst Simple Minds also appeared on the bill with Mark Kerr on drums and Eddie Duffy on bass. Forbes has sung with David Bowie, on the Iggy Pop album Soldier. He played bass on the Kirsty MacColl hit \\"A New England\\". Forbes has also performed onstage with Peter Gabriel. After Simple Minds, Forbes went on to play in a number of other bands, including Propaganda (Germany) and Oblivion Dust (Japan), Spear of Destiny, 10:51 and the Alarm. He also played in Fourgoodmen, a Scottish supergroup, between 2005-2007 and formed XSM, who were originally to consist of Forbes, MacNeil and McGee from the original Simple Minds line up. XSM recorded an album's worth of tracks, but Mick MacNeil didn't want to perform live, so Forbes and McGee took the band out, along with Owen Paul (McGee), sibling of Brian McGee. The guitar and keyboard player roles were twofold, with Steven Curley (version 1) on guitar, followed by Ant Seaman guitar (version 2) and Gary O'Hagan on keyboards (version 1) and Andy Gall keyboards (version 2).

Sprague de Camp, first published in paperback by Baen Books. All but two of the pieces were originally published between 1956 and 1993 in the magazines Galaxy, The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, Analog, and Asimov's Science Fiction, and the Robert Silverberg-edited anthology The Ultimate Dinosaur. The remaining pieces were first published in the present work. The book collects the author's nine tales of time-traveling hunter Reginald Rivers, the hero of his 1956 classic, \\"A Gun for Dinosaur\\". He wrote another Rivers story in 1990 to fulfil a request by Robert Silverberg for a dinosaur story for his 1991 anthology The Ultimate Dinosaur; afterwards, de Camp added to the sequence until he had enough stories for a book. In 2012, Audible Studios released an unabridged audio-book recording of Rivers of Time narrated by James Adams.https://www.audible.com/pd/Rivers-of-Time- Audiobook/B00B7OQGG0?qid=1553690999&sr;=1-2&ref;=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_2&pf;_rd_p=e81b7c27-6880-467a-b5a7-13cef5d729fe&pf;_rd_r=HHH9TV9HEHR45AA26TNH& Contents *\\"Faunas\\" (poem) *\\"A Gun for Dinosaur\\" - Rivers explains to a client the reason for his policy of only taking clients able to handle a heavy-caliber gun back to the late Mesozoic, with a hair-raising narrative of what once happened when a client could not. This story was adapted for radio in the NBC series X Minus One on March 7, 1956. *\\"The Cayuse\\" - Reggie tells the story of the only time they tried to bring a manned vehicle back to the prehistoric days, during which the gas fumes acted like a mating scent for a Parasaurolophus, resulting in the vehicle's subsequent destruction in a river. *\\"Crocamander Quest\\" - Misadventures bedevil a trip to the age of amphibians, especially when the divorced wife of one of the sahibs (who has accompanied her ex on the time trip) starts getting too flirtatious with the other party members. *\\"Miocene Romance\\" - A female animal rights activist stows away on a time safari chartered by a father and son to prevent anyone from shooting the animals, enraging the father and intriguing the son. *\\"The Synthetic Barbarian\\" - A client whose motive for chartering a time expedition proves to be personal wish-fulfillment gets more than he bargained for. *\\"The Satanic Illusion\\" - A challenge from religious fundamentalists to prove the theory of evolution through a time travel expedition serves instead to demonstrate the infinite capacity of the human mind for self-delusion, even if it has to involve murder. *\\"The Big Splash\\" - An expedition to chronicle the K-T event and resolve rival theories about its cause nearly makes the time-travelers participants in the great extinction. *\\"The Mislaid Mastodon\\" - After a successful \\"bring-'em-back alive\\" expedition to retrieve a mastodon from the past to the present, subsequent events prove disastrous. The plot feature of a disaffected businessman's designs on a recovered prehistoric proboscidean echoes de Camp's much earlier story \\"Employment\\" (1939). *\\"The Honeymoon Dragon\\" - Rivers and his wife visit his native Australia, where they themselves become guests on another time safari operation. The trip proves more dangerous than they expect when a fellow time-traveler with an inexplicable grudge against Rivers turns the expedition into a deadly trap. *\\"Afterword\\" - A brief resume from the author on how the stories in the book came to be written. The series The Rivers stories take the form of first- person narratives by the protagonist told to companions whose identities vary, but who have in common the fact that their contributions to the conversation are omitted, and must be inferred from those of Rivers. Every story is an anecdote from Rivers' career as a conductor of time safaris to previous eras, both to hunt prehistoric creatures and for scientific purposes (and, occasionally, anti-scientific purposes). In addition to Rivers, the main recurring characters include fellow members of his safari firm, including his partner Chandra Aiyar, camp boss Beauregard Black, and cook Ming. In most instances, the actions of their human clients prove more troublesome than those of the extinct fauna, a theme set in \\"Faunas\\", a 1968 poem by de Camp that precedes the stories. An afterword by the author tells how he came to write the series. Rules of time travel # The effective range of the stories' time machine is from about one hundred thousand years to about one billion years in the past, with periods more recent or earlier beyond its ability to reach. # The further back in time the machine travels the less accurate it is; beyond the Triassic, it may arrive days or even months off schedule. # The amount of time the machine spends in another era appears to equal in length to the amount of time that elapses in the present, in its absence. # The timestream does not appear to allow paradox, defined as anything that might significantly alter events subsequent to the period visited. For instance, a person cannot travel to the same time twice. Attempting to do results in one being thrown back to the present, \\"torn to shreds in the process.\\" The same would presumably result from attempting to interact with early humans. Therefore, the time machine is restricted from visiting the period of protohuman development, and refrains from visiting any time within one thousand years of a previous visit. Species featured Prehistoric species of various eras featured in the series include Agriochoerus, Alamosaurus, Archaeotherium, Brontops, Camptosaurus, Columbian mammoth, Coryphodon, Deinosuchus, Diprotodon, Eurypterid, Gastornis (called Diatryma), Gorgosaurus, Hoplophoneus, Hyaenodon, Ichthyostega, Mastodon, Megalania, Merycoidodon, Metamynodon, Metoposaurus, Mylodon, Ornithomimus, Parasaurolophus, Phenacodus, Placerias, Postosuchus, Procoptodon, Rutiodon, Saurophaganax or Allosaurus (referred to as Epanterias), Stegosaurus, Teratosaurus, Triceratops, Troodon formosus (presented as Stenonychosaurus, and supposedly a type of pachycephalosaur), and Tyrannosaurus trionychus. Tyrannosaurs of the genus Gorgosaurus are mentioned occasionally, and many times Reginald Rivers will say that the Raja is out in some period in the Cenozoic, taking a group to hunt some form of prehistoric mammal such as titanothere, entelodont, or uintathere. Prehistoric marsupials and Indricotherium are mentioned in \\"The Synthetic Barbarian,\\" and numerous Pleistocene megafauna are seen in \\"The Mislaid Mastodon,\\" including Castoroides ohioensis and the American lion. Obsolete science While Rivers of Time is a well researched time travel series, paleontological knowledge has improved since the stories were written, rendering some aspects of its portrait of the prehistoric past obsolete. Dated material includes the following: *Alamosaurus and other sauropods, portrayed as aquatic creatures forced to stay in the water much of the time, are now recognized as fully land-dwelling. *Stenonychosaurus, portrayed as a pachycephalosaurid, is no longer recognized as a valid species, having been found to be identical to the Troodon, a raptor-like theropod. *Gorgosaurus, portrayed as a type of carnosaur distinct from tyrannosaurs, is now included in the tyrannosaurid family. *Tyrannosaurus and other fauna portrayed as living in the middle Cretaceous in fact appeared in the last five to seven million years of the period; the actual fauna of the middle Cretaceous included species such as Nothronychus, Pawpawsaurus, Protohadros, and Zuniceratops. *The teratosaur of the late Triassic period is portrayed as a carnosaur; current thinking suggests that it and most other \\"carnosaurs\\" of the time were actually rauisuchians (with the exceptions of Liliensternus, Dilophosaurus, and their kin). Sequel A tenth story of Reginald Rivers, \\"Gun, Not for Dinosaur\\", authored by Chris Bunch, appeared in Harry Turtledove's 2005 tribute anthology honoring L. Sprague de Camp, The Enchanter Completed. This story contains elements of scientific racism and white supremacism as Rivers' client, a racist Texas millionaire, and his two Boer bodyguards attempt to prevent the evolution of Negroes by going back in time in Africa to kill their prehistoric ancestors.

Biography Early life Oake was born in Sydney, Nova Scotia, and raised in Sydney's \\"Shipyards\\" neighbourhood until the age of 14, when his family relocated to Newfoundland. Oake's father was employed as a steelworker at Sydney Steel Corporation. As a pre-medical student at Memorial University of Newfoundland, Oake volunteered at the campus radio station, which was his introduction to broadcasting. This quickly became his passion, and he decided to pursue a career in the radio and television field. Broadcasting career After part-time work at CBC St. John's, he was hired full-time by the network in 1974, and has been employed by CBC to this day. Upon being hired full-time by the CBC, Oake proceeded to drop out of Memorial University in St. John's, a decision his father did not support. Oake relocated to Winnipeg, and became the sports anchor on CBWT's 24Hours from 1979 till about 1989. From there, Oake was hired by Hockey Night in Canada, the CBC's flagship television program broadcasting National Hockey League (NHL) games to a national audience. Oake is probably best known as a regular contributor to Hockey Night in Canada. Since the 2003–04 season, he has hosted the second game of HNIC's Saturday night double-headers, first alongside Kelly Hrudey, and later with Louie DeBrusk. Even though Oake remains with the CBC after Rogers Communications, the owners of Sportsnet networks bought the sole national rights for the 2014–15 season, Oake joined the Sportsnet's national NHL coverage in June 2014. In addition to his Hockey Night role, he gains new role as ice level reporter for Sportsnet's Wednesday night games. Along with hockey, he has covered many important sporting events including the Olympics, Commonwealth Games, CFL football, and many other sports. He won the 2003 \\"Best Host or Interviewer in a Sports Program or Sportscast\\" Gemini Award. In 2004, he hosted the hockey docudrama Making the Cut.

It is considered to be the first institution of higher education in Ukraine, dating to 1576 and founded by Polish nobleman of Ruthenian descent Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski. The university was closed in 1636 soon after opening the Jesuit College in Ostroh. History In the 16th century, all higher schools of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth were under influence of the Catholic or Protestant nobles. To counter this influence, Count Konstanty Ostrogski, one of the most influential people in the Crown of Poland (and later a major partisan of the Orthodox faith against the Union of Brest), founded a large school in his estate in Ostroh in what is now Ukraine. Ostrogski envisioned a lay school, that would however strengthen the Eastern Christian spirit in the country and prevent conversions to Protestantism and Catholicism, a process in full swing at the time and as such was first mentioned in Piotr Skarga's 1577 On the Unity of God's Church under the Single Shepherd and on Greek Secession from this Unity. Piotr Skarga (1577). O jedności Kościoła Bożego pod jednym Pasterzem i o greckim od tej jedności odstąpieniu, Wilno Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski The school was founded some time between 1576 and 1580, but it did not start full activities until 1585. Initially tasked only with translation of The Bible to Ruthenian (later published as the Ostrog Bible), with time it grew to become a permanent institution of secondary education. A large part of the funding came from Princess Halszka Ostrogska's testament of 1579, in which she donated \\"six times sixty thousand\\" (360,000) Lithuanian grosz to local school, hospital and Holy Spas' (i.e. Savior's) monastery near Lutsk. The school, officially styled Academy, was modelled after Western European education of the epoch. It taught the trivium (grammar, rhetorics, dialectics) as well as the quadrivium (arithmetics, geometry, music and astronomy). It featured education in Latin, Greek and Ruthenian (predecessor to both modern Ukrainian and Belarusian), the only institution of higher education in the world teaching that language at the time. The first rector of the academy was Herasym Smotrycki, a noted Eastern Christian writer of the epoch. With time, Ostrogski assembled a significant group of professors, many of them having been expelled from the Jagiellonian University (such as the first dean of astronomy Jan Latosz) or having quarreled with the king or the Catholic clergy. However, the political nature of the conflict between Ostrogski, Protestants and Catholics prevented the school from attracting enough professors of international fame. It did however invite numerous Greek scientists from abroad, including Smotrycki's successor Kyrillos Lukaris, as well as Metropolitan bishop Kizikos, Nicefor Parasios, the envoy of the Metropolitan of Constantinople, and Emmanuel Achilleos, a religious writer. Some of the professors were also of local stock, including Jurij Rohatyniec, Wasyl Maluszycki and Jow Kniahicki. The religious character of the academy was underlined by close ties to Eastern Christian monasteries of Derman, Dubno, Slutsk and later also Pochayiv. While the school failed to attract as many students as the founder had envisioned, it nevertheless became very influential as a centre of Ruthenian (that is Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian) culture and literature. Among the notable alumni were religious writer Zacharius Kopystensky, hetman Petro Konashevych- Sahaidachny, one of the fathers of Belarusian poetry Andrzej Rymsza and future exarchs of Lwów Gedeon Balaban and of Polotsk Meletius Smotrytsky, son of the first rector and a noted Orthodox writer and teacher. It also became the alma mater of professors of the so-called brotherhood schools for Orthodox burghers being founded in late 16th century all around the country in accordance with the royal decree of 1585 by king Stefan Batory.

Control variables could strongly influence experimental results, were they not held constant during the experiment in order to test the relative relationship of the dependent and independent variables. The control variables themselves are not of primary interest to the experimenter. Usage A variable in an experiment which is held constant in order to assess the relationship between multiple variables, is a control variable.control variable; Business Dictionary online; retrieved September 2015.Definitions; Science Buddies – Science Fair Projects. A control variable is an element that is not changed throughout an experiment, because its unchanging state allows the relationship between the other variables being tested to be better understood.PPT Download; Essentially, a control variable is what is kept the same throughout the experiment, and it is not of primary concern in the experimental outcome. Any change in a control variable in an experiment would invalidate the correlation of dependent variables (DV) to the independent variable (IV), thus skewing the results. Experimental examples In any system existing in a natural state, many variables may be interdependent, with each affecting the other. Scientific experiments test the relationship of an IV –that element which is manipulated by the experimenter– to the DV –that element affected by the manipulation of the IV. Any additional independent variable can be a control variable. Take, for example, the combined gas law, which is stated mathematically as: : \\\\qquad \\\\frac {PV}{T}= k where: : is the pressure : is the volume : is the thermodynamic temperature measured in kelvins : is a constant (with units of energy divided by temperature). :which shows that the ratio between the pressure-volume product and the temperature of a system remains constant. In an experimental verification of parts of the combined gas law, ( * = ), where Pressure, Temperature, and Volume are all variables, to test the resultant changes to any of these variables requires at least one to be kept constant. This is in order to see comparable experimental results in the remaining variables. If Temperature is made the control variable and it is not allowed to change throughout the course of the experiment, the relationship between the dependent variables, Pressure and Volume, can quickly be established by changing the value for one or the other, and this is Boyle's law. For instance, if the Pressure is raised then the Volume must decrease. If, however, Volume is made the control variable and it is not allowed to change throughout the course of the experiment, the relationship between dependent variables, Pressure and Temperature, can quickly be established by changing the value for one or the other, and this is Gay-Lussac's Law. For instance, if the Pressure is raised then the Temperature must increase. References External links *Definitions; Science Buddies – Science Fair Projects.

The asymmetrical tonic neck reflex (ATNR) is a primitive reflex found in newborn humans that normally vanishes around 6 months of age. It is also known as the \\"fencing reflex\\" because of the characteristic position of the infant's arms and head, which resembles that of a classically trained fencer. When the face is turned to one side, the arm and leg on the side to which the face is turned extend and the arm and leg on the opposite side flex. The presence of the ATNR, as well as other primitive reflexes, such as the tonic labyrinthine reflex (TLR), beyond the first six months of life may indicate that the child has developmental delays, at which point the reflex is atypical or abnormal. For example, in children with cerebral palsy, the reflexes may persist and even be more pronounced. As abnormal reflexes, both the ATNR and the TLR can cause problems for the growing child. The ATNR and TLR both hinder functional activities such as rolling, bringing the hands together, or even bringing the hands to the mouth. Over time, both the ATNR and TLR can cause serious damage to the growing child's joints and bones. The ATNR can cause the spine to curve (scoliosis). Both the ATNR and TLR can cause subluxation of the femoral head or dislocation of the femoral head as it completely moves out of the hip socket. When abnormal reflexes persist in a child, evidence suggests early intervention involving extensive physical therapy as the most beneficial course of treatment. The fencing response occurs in adults as a result of mechanical forces applied to the head, typically associated with contact sports. The Fencing Response is transient and indicates moderate forces applied to the brainstem, resulting in a traumatic brain injury.

They probably spoke an Iroquoian language. The Spanish called these people Chichimeco (not to be confused with Chichimeca in Mexico), and Virginia colonists may have called the same people Richahecrian. Their first appearance in the historical record is as a powerful tribe in colonial Virginia who had migrated from the mountains into the region around present-day Richmond. Their population provided a force of 700–900 warriors. Early academic analysis of the origin of the Westo posited that the so-called Rechahecrian/Rickohakan of Virginia were perhaps Cherokee or Yuchi, and that the Westo were a band of Yuchi. Anthropologist Marvin T. Smith (1987:131–32) was the first to suggest that the Westo were a group of Erie, who had lived south of Lake Erie until forced to migrate further south to Virginia during the 17th-century Beaver Wars. Smith theorizes that as the colonial settlements expanded in Virginia, the Westo migrated south to the Savannah River shortly before the founding of South Carolina in 1670. Subsequent work by John Worth (1995:17) and Eric Bowne (2006) strongly supports Smith’s hypothesis. History Virginia established a trading relationship with the Westo, exchanging firearms for Indian slaves. When the Westo migrated to the Savannah River, they quickly became known for their military power and their slave raids on other tribes. Before their destruction, the Westo wreaked havoc on the Spanish missionary provinces of Guale and Mocama. On July 20, 1661, a Westo war party canoed down the Altamaha River and destroyed the Spanish mission of Santo Domingo de Talaje near present-day Darien, Georgia. Florida governor Alonso de Aránguiz y Cortés sent troops to what is now St. Simons, Georgia to guard against further raids. That the Westo had ties with Virginia did not mean they would be friendly toward the South Carolinians. In 1673 the Westo attacked coastal Indians, such as the Cusabo, as well as the Carolina colony. The colony depended on the Esaw (Catawba) tribe for defense until December 1674, when some Westo visited Dr. Henry Woodward and made peace. The peace became an alliance after the Westo escorted Woodward to their towns on the Savannah River, giving many presents and encouraging friendship. From 1675 to 1680, trade between the Westo and South Carolina thrived. The Westo provided Carolina with slaves, captured from various Native American groups, including the Spanish-allied tribes in Guale and Mocama. These were the \\"Settlement Indians\\", supposedly under the protection of Carolina. The Westo likely captured slaves from the Cherokee, Chickasaw, and the various smaller tribes who would later align as the Creek Confederacy. Since the Westo were traditionally enemies with nearly every other tribe in the region, their alliance with Carolina effectively blocked the colony from establishing any other tribal relationship. A group of Shawnee Indians migrated to the Savannah River region and met with the Westo while Henry Woodward was among them. These Shawnee became known as the \\"Savannah Indians\\". Woodward apparently witnessed the first meeting of the Shawnee and Westo. Using sign language, the Shawnee (Savannah) warned the Westo of an impending attack from other tribes. They earned the goodwill of the Westo, who began to prepare for the attack. The Savannah later approached Woodward and established an independent relationship with the colonists, which would doom the Westo. The Carolinians realized the value of trading beyond the Westo. When war broke out between Carolina and the Westo in 1679, the Savannah/Shawnee assisted the Carolinians. After they destroyed the Westo in 1680, the Savannah moved into their lands and took over their role as the chief Indian trading partner with the Carolina colony. The fate of most of the surviving Westo was probably enslavement and shipment to work on sugarcane plantations in the West Indies.Information on slave raids, Dr. Woodward, Savannah/Shawnee, and the defeat of the Westo mainly from Gallay 2002. 1755 map of North America by John Mitchell, emphasizing the area east of the Mississippi River Some surviving Westo may have continued to live near the colony of South Carolina. A map published anonymously in 1715 shows Indian villages during the period from about 1691 to 1715, when the early Creek towns had relocated from the Chattahoochee River to the Ocmulgee River and Oconee River. The map shows a town labeled \\"Westas\\" (all the towns labels are pluralized) on the Ocmulgee River above the Towaliga River confluence. It is one of a cluster of towns near the important \\"Lower Creek\\" town of Coweta. The 1715 map shows town locations as of some time between 1691 and 1715, when the Lower Creek moved their towns back to the Chattahoochee River. The town appears on the Mitchell map of 1755 just below the town of Euchees. As with several other groups of Indian refugees who found haven with the Lower Creeks, the apparent fate of the surviving Westo was absorption into the emerging Creek confederacyWorth 2000.

Australian career After being spotted playing Australian Rules Football in a services team in Darwin by Ray Stehr in 1941, Cooper joined the Eastern Suburbs club. Stehr invited Cooper to trial with the Roosters following World War II. A powerful , Cooper played in just 6 matches before gaining selection for New South Wales. Later that year Cooper was a member of Eastern Suburbs' 8th premiership-winning team. In 1946 Cooper represented Sydney, New South Wales and Australia; he played in all three tests against the Great Britain Lions that year at home. Cooper also took out the 'NSW Player of the Year Award' in 1946. The Gregory's reference describes him as a bullocking, bruising winger who was a great finisher of back-line movements. His hard-running style incorporated a hip-bumping technique to brush off defenders. British career In 1947 he joined English club Huddersfield, where he had 9 successful seasons - scoring 420 tries, including 71 in the 1951–52 season. In one match that year, against Keighley, he scored a record 10 tries. Also joining Cooper was his friend Johnny Hunter, a full- back, and a little later Pat Devery, an Australian test centre who formed a partnership with Cooper on the left. Cooper continued to play test rugby league whilst at Huddersfield, playing for 14 matches for the Other Nationalities in the International Championship between 1949 and 1953. He also played for the British Empire XIII versus New Zealand on Wednesday 23 January 1952 at Stamford Bridge. Cooper played left-wing, i.e. number 5, in Huddersfield's 4-11 defeat by Bradford Northern in the 1949 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1949–50 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Saturday 29 October 1949. He also played left-wing in the 18-8 victory over Batley in the 1952 Yorkshire Cup Final at Headingley on Saturday 15 November 1952, scoring 3 tries. He also played in Huddersfield's 2-20 defeat by Wigan in the 1949–50 Championship Final at Maine Road, Manchester on Saturday 13 May 1950. Cooper played on the wing and scored two tries in Huddersfield's 15-10 victory over St. Helens in the 1953 Challenge Cup Final during the 1952–53 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 25 April 1953, in front of a crowd of 89,588.McCorquodale, London S.E (25 April 1953).

The program was noteworthy because during this era a large majority of TV stations signed off between 1 and 3 a.m., with what few stations that operated 24 hours a day then either running syndicated shows and/or old movies. Key personalities NBC News Overnight was the brainchild of NBC News president Reuven Frank, who conceived the show as inexpensive overnight programming after Late Night with David Letterman. The time slot was one that had originally been offered to and partially occupied by Tom Snyder's Tomorrow, before Snyder quit and ended that program in 1981 (and being replaced by Letterman in Snyder's former timeslot in February 1982). Frank had created the news program Weekend in 1974, and the two programs shared a similar, sometimes ironic outlook on the news. Weekend's co- hosts Lloyd Dobyns and Linda Ellerbee were reunited for the program initially, though Bill Schechner replaced Dobyns in November 1982. Herb Dudnick was the program's first executive producer and was succeeded by Deborah B. Johnson. Humorous sign offs During the show's early months the anchors were known for signing off in a humorous fashion. For example, during one installment Dobyns was given a very long, complex word to say and he stumbled over it; at the end of that broadcast the anchor took a moment to praise his writing staff, only to light-heartedly threaten to \\"take it all back\\" if they ever included such a word in his scripts again. Dobyns and then Ellerbee closed each show by saying, \\"And So It Goes.\\" (which had been Dobyns' sign-off on Weekend). It became a bit of a catch-phrase and was the title of her first autobiographical book. Critical response NBC News Overnight was widely regarded as one of the smartest television news shows.http://www.popmatters.com/column/nbc-news-overnight-and-so-it-went/ Appealing to an eclectic audience of college students, nursing mothers, and late shift workers, the show broke the conventional \\"lowest common denominator\\" style of most news programs and injected humor into an otherwise boring medium, while providing news analysis usually unseen on other major- network newscasts.John J. O'Connor, \\"TV View; 'Overnight'-Low-Keyed News for Late, Late Viewing,\\" New York Times, Sept. 12, 1982. TIME named it one of the best programs of 1982, calling it \\"TV's wittiest, toughest, least snazzy news strip\\",\\"The Best of 1982,\\" TIME, Jan. 3, 1983. and, after the program left the air, one of the best programs of 1983.\\"The Best of 1983,\\" TIME, Jan. 2, 1984. The duPont Columbia Awards awards jury cited NBC News Overnight as \\"possibly the best written and most intelligent news program ever.\\" Encyclopedia of Television, 2nd Ed. 2004, Museum of Broadcast Communications, by Fitzroy Dearborn, Horace Newcomb (ed.), CRC Press, Boca Raton Influences NBC News Overnight was the inspiration for many news shows. From ABC's World News Now to Countdown with Keith Olbermann, many have attempted to imitate Overnight's signature style of combining hard news features with incisive commentary and light hearted stories.\\"Reuven Frank, RIP,\\" TV Barn, Feb. 7, 2006. The Seven Network in Australia had a similar program with the same name (minus the NBC) airing overnights on weeknights between 1985 and 1989. Clips from NBC News programs would often be shown within the show. Cancellation Despite a loyal audience, the show's rather weak ratings, high production cost (the show cost $3.5 million to produce) and corresponding lack of ad revenue led to the show's demise after only a year and a half on the air. After news of this got out, some viewers sent in money help defray the costs of producing the program (all of which was returned). The 367th and final telecast of NBC News Overnight aired on December 3, 1983. The show's timeslot was replaced by either local programming (movies or syndicated shows) or dead air (if a station had signed off after Late Night With David Letterman or the then-new Friday Night Videos on Fridays). NBC eventually resumed programming the 1:30 time slot when it debuted Later in 1988, which has been succeeded in the 21st century by Last Call and A Little Late. NBC's next late night newscast, NBC Nightside, premiered in 1991; it would last until 1998; the network has not had a late night newscast since then, with most NBC stations today running either paid programming, Early Today or local morning newscasts in the former Overnight/Nightside slots.

Set in Los Angeles, the film relates the story of a young man (Speakman), who is trained in the martial art of American Kenpo, and his fight against the Korean mafia. Speakman was a student of and was advised closely by Ed Parker in the making of this film. The film's taglines included \\"No gun. No knife. No equal.\\" and \\"Just try him.\\" and is the only well-known Hollywood depiction of Kenpo techniques on-screen. The hit 1990s song The Power by rap group Snap! is featured extensively in the movie's soundtrack. Plot Jeff Sanders (Jeff Speakman) leads a double life of sorts: by day, he is a simple, unassuming construction worker, and by night, an expert Kenpo student and master of his craft. Jeff's background is revealed; after losing his mother as a teenager, he became an outcast and frequently lashed out at his family and society in an attempt to assuage his anger. His father, Captain Sanders (Beau Starr), gained the idea from a mutual friend, Kim (Mako), to enroll Jeff in a Kenpō school to better manage his rage and feelings. However, he lost his temper with a football player who punched his younger brother, and knocked him out with a powerful kick. Displeased with this event, Jeff's father forced him to move out of their home. Jeff, now estranged from his family and living alone, continued with his courses in Kenpo and eventually adopted Kim as a mentor and father figure. Jeff decides to return to his old neighborhood to visit Kim. Inside his shop, Kim is having trouble with local Korean mafia families, due to his refusal to pay them off and use his antique store to peddle drugs. Jeff helps out Kim and beats up the henchmen who attacked his store. A mysterious hit-man named Tanaka (Professor Tanaka) appears and kills the lead henchman due to his failure to force Kim to comply by head-butting him. He later kills Kim and although Jeff tries to chase him down, Tanaka escapes. Jeff vows to avenge Kim's death and is determined to find out who ordered Kim's murder. He remembers a boy named Jimmy (Dante Basco) who lived with Kim, and tries to find him to ask if he knows about the murder. However, Jeff's estranged younger brother Adam (John Dye), now a cop, is investigating the case, and warns Jeff against trying to take matters into his own hands. In his hunt, Jeff is approached by a mafia boss named Yung (James Hong) who claims to be Kim's friend and points him to a fellow mafia boss named Sam. However, upon breaking into Sam's residence and attempting to kill him, Jimmy appears and reveals that Sam was one of Kim's closest friends and was the one who took him in for protection. Jimmy also clarifies that Yung is the one responsible for Kim's death, and was merely attempting to use Jeff as a pawn to kill his rival boss Sam. Jeff now plans to kill Yung, but Jimmy warns him that Yung is always protected by his hit-man Tanaka. In order to eliminate Tanaka, Jeff asks Jimmy to falsely testify (to Adam) that he witnessed Tanaka murdering Kim. Jeff has plotted to have Adam arrest Tanaka so that Jeff can get Yung alone to kill him. Adam and the police eventually capture Tanaka after a long car chase, but to Jeff's dismay Yung was absent from the car. Tanaka is knocked out with a taser, but later manages to escape from the police, breaking out of the police car and injuring Adam — and the driver — in the process. Jimmy overhears that Yung plans to escape the country by boat, and tells Jeff about Yung's drug factory. Now in a bigger hurry, Jeff sets out to attack Yung's drug factory, using his martial arts skills and various weapons to defeat the guards and employees protecting Yung. He eventually subdues Yung, but is attacked by Tanaka. Although Tanaka gains the upper hand during their fight, Jeff manages to kill Tanaka by setting fire to a nearby gas tank. Despite initially wanting to kill Yung, Jeff decides to capture him alive (showing he has learned self-control) and turns Yung in to his father, Captain Sanders. The film ends with Jeff entering the kenpo dojo to visit his former master and a former fellow student.

Publication history He first appeared in Showcase #37 alongside his creations, the Metal Men and was created by Robert Kanigher and Ross Andru. Fictional character biography One of the most impressive geniuses of the DC Universe with doctorates in theoretical mathematics, mechanical engineering, and particle physics, William Maxwell \\"Will\\" Magnus often offers scientific advice to other characters. His greatest achievement is the one for which he first received renown: the creation of the Metal Men. The method through which Doc Magnus created the Metal Man has varied over years with various writers. At first they were just blank slate robots with responsometers, devices which generated their intelligence and personalities which just happened to be evocative of the metals from which they were formed. In an attempt to boost sales of the comic book, the characters underwent vast changes. The Metal Men all assumed human alter egos, while Doc Magnus became a fugitive scientist dedicated to global conquest. His personality change was credited to having been kidnapped, reawakened, and brainwashed by a mad dictator. Sales plunged instead and the comic was not printed for a few years. Eventually Metal Men was picked up again with Doc's sanity restored and he returned to assist his Metal Men. At one point he saved Doom Patrol's Robotman, whose original body had been destroyed by Madame Rouge. Doc Magnus recovered Robotman's brain and built him a new cybernetic body. In 1993, a four-part Metal Men miniseries retconned much of their backstory. It was revealed that the responsometers were not responsible for the Metal Men's sentience and that the Metal Men actually were imprinted with the intellects and personalities of real people: Magnus' own brother Mike, his fiancee Sharon, two lab workers Redmond Wilde and Randy Pressman, a janitor named Thomas Tinkham, and a pizza-delivery man named Jack. These unfortunate personalities were accidentally transferred to blank robots in a lab accident. At the climax of the miniseries, Gold, one of his robots, was permanently killed and Doc Magnus mortally wounded. Doc permanently transferred his personality into a blank robot known as Veridium, made of a green alien metal, becoming the new robotic leader of the Metal Men. 52 With the advent of Identity Crisis, Gold is back and Doc Magnus is once again human and played an active role in the series 52. As revealed during Infinite Crisis, when Superboy-Prime pounded on the walls of reality, he caused the very fabric of reality to shift, changing and merging histories. The \\"blank robots with responsometers\\" origin is said to be the definitive origin while the \\"human personalities\\" origin and the 1993 miniseries has been described as the byproduct of a mental breakdown suffered by Magnus. When Booster Gold visited, asking for help with Skeets, Magnus commented that the Metal Men \\"don't quite work anymore\\". The responsometers are now described as containing an \\"artificial soul\\" invented by Doc Magnus, as inspired by T. O. Morrow, who is revealed to have taught him at college and to have been the only one not to laugh at Magnus's theories. After the unexplained dismantling of the Metal Men, Doc Magnus is unable to recreate these souls and restore their personalities. He now takes Prozac for the bipolar disorder which caused his nervous breakdown and the depression which led to the creation of the Plutonium Man, a tremendous, nearly indestructible superweapon based upon the Metal Men, but with Magnus' then-own deranged, twisted worldview as its operating system. It is implied that although the medication is keeping Magnus from doing anything irrational, it is also deadening his imagination and creativity and that this is the reason he can not recreate the Metal Men. Magnus is approached by government agents hoping to use the Metal Men as soulless smart weapons, an offer Magnus rejects. Through all of this, Magnus visits Morrow in his cell in Haven. Morrow warns Magnus that there have been numerous abductions of \\"mad\\" scientists, including Doctor Sivana, whose lair Magnus investigates. Eventually Morrow himself disappears, leaving a note for his former student with a string in machine code. Using the code, Magnus is able to revive Mercury, but his robotic friend and creation is apparently destroyed again while trying to save him from the conspiracy trying to kidnap every mad scientist in the DCU. During Week 22, mindless replicas of the Metal Men force Magnus to escape from his burned house before he is captured by what is revealed to be a separate group \\"Chang Tzu's Science Squad\\".\\"52\\" Week 22 This would be the second time Magnus has confronted Chang Tzu. A previous incarnation of the villain once managed to brainwash the Metal Men, but their loyalty to Magnus restored their rightful minds. This group is based on Oolong Island (said to be part of the territory of China) and has been responsible for the disappearing scientists (including Professor Morrow). The group is being financed by Intergang with the collusion, it is implied, of the Chinese government. The assembled scientists have been given unlimited budgets to invent various super weapons including, in particular, various types of robots. During Week 23, a giant robot, piloted by animals from Intergang, delivers Doc Magnus to Oolong Island.\\"52\\" Week 23 Magnus is assigned to design and construct a new Plutonium Man robot, but deliberately makes little progress, saying to Morrow that the original Plutonium Man was an expression of his pain and rage brought on by his mental illness and that the reason he takes his medication is to prevent himself from doing something like that again. Morrow reveals this to the Island's leaders and Magnus's medication is confiscated. Magnus then proceeds to work on Plutonium Man, saying this time he will \\"do it right\\". Though he is unstable due to his lack of medication, Magnus is not fully co-operating with Chang Tzu. Magnus goes about scavenging materials from various items (gold from a gold watch, lead from lead shielding, mercury from thermometers, and tin from cans of baked beans which he adopts as his sole diet - presumably in order to ensure the other scientists will not want to spend too much time with him, as well). This allows him to reconstruct his Metal Men, albeit only a few inches high. These new Metal Men are shown to help Magnus remain sane despite being off his pills, such as when they persuade him to deactivate the now completed Plutonium Man after he turns it on during a period of depression. Ooolong Island is attacked by the JSA seeking to rescue Black Adam, and Chang Tzu orders the Plutonium Man activated. Chang notes that he has been spying on Magnus and knows that several metals have entered the lab and not come back out. The Metal Men attack Chang Tzu, allowing Magnus to escape and switch off the Island's defenses. While he does this Morrow confronts Magnus and destroys Mercury, yet again. Magnus explains to Morrow why it's pointless to stop him from deactivating the shields as the JSA will get in eventually, and instead offers him the chance to teleport out, saying that Morrow was \\"the best teacher I ever knew\\" and that he tries \\"to over look the psychopathic super villain thing\\". Morrow accepts the offer. Magnus is then confronted by Chang Tzu whom he apparently kills with the aid of Lead and what he describes as a particle wave ray gun. Magnus also indicates this shooting was a result of his irrationality, brought on by the lack of his medications. Magnus then surrenders to the JSA. With all charges against him dropped, due to being coerced into collaboration, Will Magnus returns to his home and laboratory. There, when Booster Gold visits him again, exactly one year after their last meeting, with a salvaged responsometer containing Skeets' \\"memself\\", asking him to somehow restore the robot destroyed by Mister Mind, Magnus agrees. He reveals to have in his possession a copy of Skeets' memories, and so he is able to rebuild him as a security droid 2.0, slightly more advanced, but oblivious of the events of the past years. Now sane again, he returns to working on his Metal Men. Superman/Batman In the Superman/Batman series Doc Magnus is shown working again with his Metal Men. He has even built a new one, the spunky and wisecracking gynoid Copper. Despite contrary advice from his fiancée he asks Bruce Wayne for a tryout of his Metal Men as security guards. The trial is successful, but the Metal Men fail on the field, due to mistrust by the human personnel and Brainiac's influence, leaving Doc Magnus the responsibility of saving the day.\\"Superman/Batman\\" #34-36 (2007) JLA Magnus has recently assisted the Justice League of America with the rebuilding of Red Tornado. After Red Tornado's first intended body is stolen by Amazo, he is called on again to provide Red Tornado with yet another new body, more powerful and advanced than the previous one. Despite his good intentions, the attempts comes to another downfall, and almost spells his death, when Amazo returns to claim the newer and stronger body for himself. Metal Men (2009) The Metal Men are later restored as a second feature in the revamped Doom Patrol (5th series), written by Keith Giffen. Now living in simple suburbia in Kanigher Street, the Metal Men seem to be affected by his currently, partly deranged, state of mind. Iron seems unaffected, Gold is now humorously self-obsessed and magniloquent, Platina is lovesick, Lead is dimwitted and prone to errors, Tin is always scared and affected by chronic self-esteem issues, and Mercury, once brilliant and humorous, has now developed the same bipolar disturbance affecting Will Magnus himself, and refuses to take medications. Copper, the newest and seventh member, is disturbingly ignored by her teammates, who often refuse to acknowledge her presence despite being side by side with her.

Magnus tells him the history of the Metal Men project, how they were built to execute search and rescue missions that humans could not tackle. After he was able to get them online, the government went back on their word and chose to have the Metal Men become assassins. The Metal Men hid at Magnus' apartment where they help protect Magnus and the population from an experiment gone wrong, destroying themselves in the process.

Film * Dr. Will Magnus appeared in Warner Premiere's animated feature Justice League: The New Frontier, voiced by Townsend Coleman. * An alternate reality version of Will Magnus appeared as the main antagonist in Justice League: Gods and Monsters, voiced by C. Thomas Howell. He first appears as an ally of Kirk Langstrom, having helped devise Kirk's serum that transformed him into a pseudo-vampire (and later Batman) as part of an attempt to cure his cancer. However, it is later revealed that a year after Kirk's accident, he accidentally beat his wife Tina to death after he realized that she preferred Kirk over him. This prompted him to set out to try and end all human conflict as he felt that his actions, committed by himself as a particularly rational, intelligent, and benevolent man, proved that there was no hope for humanity. To this end, he frames the Justice League members Superman (Hernan Guerra), Batman (Kirk Langstrom), and Wonder Woman (Bekka of New Genesis) for the deaths of various scientists like Ray Palmer, Silas Stone, Victor Stone, and Victor Fries. This is meant to drive them out of their base so he can use Superman's old ship as a power source for a series of miniature Boom Tubes which will plant nanites in the minds of every human on the planet in order to connect them into a collective consciousness. Although Superman and Bekka are kept occupied by various human troops who believe that the League were responsible for Magnus' murders, Kirk manages to keep Magnus occupied long enough for Lex Luthor to reveal the truth, allowing the League to destroy Magnus' equipment. With his plan foiled and regretting his actions, Magnus commits suicide by apparently destroying his organic nanites. Video games * Will Magnus is featured in DC Universe Online.

The strategy was developed under the Reagan administration as a means of safeguarding America's inventory of MX missiles during the final decade of the Cold War. It was never used; MX was deployed in existing silos and then removed from service as the Cold War ended. MX basing debate The U.S. commitments under the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty prevented the development and construction of adequate ABM installations around its nuclear missile silos. Therefore, it was decided that new and unconventional strategies for protecting these military assets from a sneak-attack had to be developed. The original concept had been to place the MX missile silos on the reverse side of tall hills or mesas. Enemy warheads approach at an angle of about 25 degrees above horizontal, so if the slope of the hill was greater, the warhead would impact the hill short of the silo. However, as the Soviet ICBMs introduced their Fractional Orbital Bombardment System and high-angle \\"lofted\\" trajectories, this no longer offered any extra protection. In 1979, after a long debate on the topic, President Jimmy Carter selected the \\"multiple protective shelters\\" concept for basing the MX. In this system, the 200 MX missiles would be partnered with many thousands of silos, and the missiles would be moved among the silos so the Soviets would not know where they were. In order to attack the MX fleet and do any significant damage, they would have to attack every silo. With enough silos, they would use up much of their warhead inventory to destroy only 200 missiles, a cost that was so high they would not contemplate it. Derided as the \\"racetrack\\" proposal, the primary problem was that it required huge tracts of land. It was immediately opposed in Nevada, and finally fell out of favor in Utah when the Mormons turned against it as well. Dense Pack When Ronald Reagan took over in 1981 he agreed to reexamine the basing question, as opposition by Nevada senator Paul Laxalt had become overwhelming by this point. For the immediate future, 60 MX's would be placed in surplus Titan II missile silos while a final basing solution was chosen. After an equally long and contentious debate, the Dense Pack system was chosen. The new strategy was mentioned in a speech by President Ronald Reagan in 1982. According to the Dense Pack strategy, a series of ten to twelve hardened silos would be grouped closely together in a line. This line of silos would generally run north-to-south, as the primary flight path for Soviet inbound nuclear missiles would be expected to come from the north over the North Pole. Each \\"super-hardened\\" silo would require an almost direct hit ground burst to destroy the missile within. When the first warhead went off, it would create a huge cloud of debris that was ejected thousands of feet into the sky. When the next warhead arrived it would hit this debris and be destroyed. Even if a warhead was successful in reaching the ground, it would create more dust and then lower the chance of the next one working. This basic idea had been considered during the Minuteman missile era under the name dust defense. In this case, it was US nuclear bombs buried near the silos that created the cloud of debris. This was abandoned because the \\"dust\\" would be extremely radioactive and millions would die when the resulting fallout fell back to the ground. In this case, however, it was Soviet warheads causing the fallout, which was politically acceptable. The proposed Dense Pack initiative met with strong criticism in the media and in the government, dismissed as \\"duncepack\\" or \\"sixpack\\". Detractors of the Dense Pack strategy pointed out a number of flaws. First, the advent of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles, or MIRV, negated the concept due to their ability to conduct a time-on-target barrage. Since all the warheads were arriving from a single missile, they could easily be launched to arrive within seconds of each other. In this case, the explosions would not yet have created the massive cloud of dirt, and they would all fall largely unimpeded. Secondly, there were widespread doubts at the time that the hardened nature of the armored missile silos were as robust as the military claimed. If the silos could not survive a near-miss, then clustering the silos would allow a single warhead to destroy multiple silos, perhaps all of them. If the silos were not as hard as claimed, Dense Pack actually lowered their survival rate. Finally, Dense Pack was perceived by some to be a provocative, if not overtly hostile measure at a time when nuclear warfare seemed to be a distinct possibility. Ultimately, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected using the Dense Pack strategy by a 245–176 vote. The U.S. Air Force reconsidered the use of the Dense Pack strategy in 1986, at least in part to find a way to add 50 additional missiles authorized by Congress only if a \\"safe\\" basing strategy could be found. There is no evidence that the Dense Pack strategy was ever implemented.

WPS offers health insurance plans for groups and individuals and benefit plan administration for businesses. WPS also provides insurance claims processing services under various U.S. government contracts and has a subsidiary corporation, EPIC Specialty Benefits, offering dental and other nonmedical benefits. History In 1946, the State Medical Society of Wisconsin formed the WPS division in Milwaukee to market and administer the Wisconsin Plan, a non-profit insurance plan intended to help those having difficulty paying for health care. Charles Crownhart became WPS’ first chief executive officer in 1946, and WPS was awarded the American Medical Association (AMA) Seal of Acceptance in 1948. WPS relocated from Milwaukee to Madison in 1950. WPS expanded across the state over the next decade, opening sales offices in Kenosha, Green Bay, Eau Claire, Milwaukee, and Wausau. Later, offices were opened in Appleton and La Crosse. WPS moved its Madison headquarters to 1717 W. Broadway in November 1973. In 1998, WPS consolidated its three major lines of business—Medicare, TRICARE, and WPS Health Insurance—on its Monona campus. In 1975, the Wisconsin legislature passed a law requiring that service insurance corporations be legally separate from the parent professional society. In order to comply with the legislation, on April 27, 1977, WPS ended its relationship with the Wisconsin Medical Society, becoming an independent not-for-profit corporation. Ray Koenig was named the first president of WPS. On June 11, 2012, Mike Hamerlik succeeded Jim Riordan as WPS president and chief executive officer. Hamerlik was formerly the CEO of Noridian Administrative Services, LLC.

It is about the life of writer Charles 'Chub' Fuller, who while attending Oberlin College from 1968 to 1972 channels his childhood experiences as the only child of an alcoholic, suicidal father and a moody, impossible-to-please mother into a series of short stories, shared only with his friend and foil Stanley 'Two- Brew' Kitchel. The book was one of Goldman's most autobiographical novels.Egan p 187-199 Plot The first time Chub gets the impulse to write, he has witnessed a fight between the girl of his dreams, B.J. Peacock, and her boyfriend Del that centers on a man knowing he'll never be able to make his woman happy, but that he'll never be able not to try. Two-Brew is a harsh critic, but feels Chub has the gift—his highest praise for anything Chub has written are four words: \\"on to the next\\"—implying that he wants to read more of Chub's work. Two-Brew's father runs Sutton Press in New York, and Chub's first long-awaited visit to New York City is punctuated with the surprise that Two-Brew's father has agreed to publish Chub's first short story. Chub's writing continues, usually after a collision of an emotional experience in his daily life with a childhood memory, and results in a series of short stories. Over one Christmas break, he visits his mother to surprise her with his published short story, but she sees herself portrayed negatively and explodes. Chub leaves almost as soon as he arrives, and returns to the Oberlin dorm with weeks of Christmas break ahead of him and nothing to do but write. He births a long story about his father's rise, fall and suicide—the best story he's written, Chub thinks—but Two-Brew insists that it's wrong for a short story and should be a novel. Chub's writing continues, but his focus on his studies suffers, and he graduates jobless. He works at a bar the summer after graduation when Two-Brew, now a young executive in his father's publishing house, suggests Chub connect his short stories and pitch them as a book, as a prelude to the novel about his father. Chub agrees immediately, but Two-Brew has already made the pitch. He hands Chub an envelope with two advance checks, and Chub moves to New York to write his novel. The book of short stories is published as Under the Weather, and is a modest hit. While Chub enjoys the praise, his walkup flat and New York life in general, he simply isn't writing. He is distracted by illness, and the return of B.J. Peacock into his life, now divorced with a young daughter Jesse, and aware that she inspired Chub's first story. They fall in love, marry and Chub is blissfully happy as both husband and father. However, B.J.'s jealousy extends to his relationship with Jesse, and during a Hawaii trip designed to recapture their happiness, Jesse is drowned by a rogue wave while in Chub's care, which leads to divorce, and a long, dark period for Chub. He teaches at his old school and is terrorized by a student he reported for plagiarism. Years pass. Chub lives in New York doing research for other writers, paralyzed by the incandescent emotion of his father's suicide, Jesse's death and his divorce. At a party for Two-Brew celebrating his ascension to head of the publishing company, he meets Bonita Kraus (\\"The Bone\\"), a tall, intense ex-model with aspirations of writing in the genre of Trash. Two wounded people, they share intimacy of a sort, but only when Sandy Smith, a nubile young fan of Under the Weather shows up at Chub's doorstep and stays does he feel the urge to love and write again. However, she sought him out because another man told her he was \\"Charley Fuller\\" the writer of Under the Weather. Sandy falls to her death from his window while Chub is gone, and while the police seem convinced it was suicide, Chub investigates his former student, now an escaped mental patient, then the man posing as Charley Fuller. His efforts to untangle the case make his writer's impulse run even more strongly, and he works up an outline of the story, shows it to Two-Brew and gets the cherished \\"On to the next\\" reaction. Finally back on the right path, Chub seeks out The Bone, wanting to move in with her so they both can write and support each other, but upon telling his story, The Bone unconsciously lets slip a detail linking her with Sandy's murder. Chub, terrified, can only repeat to himself that this is excellent material. He just has to live long enough to know how to use it. Reception The book received some poor reviews.

Uxellodunum can be found on this map in the territory of the Cadurci in south west Gaul. Uxellodunum is an Iron Age hill fort, or oppidum, located above the river Dordogne near the modern-day French village of Vayrac in the Lot department. This stronghold lay within the lands of the Cadurci tribe. According to Aulus Hirtius in his addendum to Julius Caesar's Commentaries on the Gallic War, the last revolt against Rome's authority in Gaul occurred here, and was brutally punished.Mopping Up in Gaul The Commentaries on the Gallic War describe Uxellodunum as being strongly fortified by its natural position, with a river dividing the valley below that almost surrounded the steep craggy mountain on which the citadel was built.Book 8, chapter 40, The Gallic Wars by Julius Caesar, translated from the Latin by W. A. McDevitte and W. S. Bohn (1869) The name apparently means \\"high fort\\"; \\"dun\\" is a Celtic word for fort which is to be found in many place-names.Encyclopedia universalis Description of siege The main source of information about the siege in 51 BC is Book 8 of the Commentaries on the Gallic War. The siege is also mentioned briefly by the engineer Sextus Julius Frontinus in his book Stratagems. The siege began after Lucterius, the leader of the Cadurci, and Drapes from the Senones, prepared Uxellodunum against a Roman assault. Caesar's commander in the area, the legate Gaius Caninius Rebilus, deployed his two legions. Informed by letter of the situation, Caesar decided to take personal charge of the siege. Commentaries, Book 8 Caesar saw that his work could never be brought to a successful conclusion if similar revolts were allowed to break out constantly in different parts of the county and believed his \\"clemency\\" was so well known that no one would think him a cruel man if he took severe measures. He therefore decided to deter all others by making an example of the defenders of Uxellodunum. All who had borne arms had their hands cut off and were then let go so that everyone might see what punishment was meted evildoers. Location and conservation of site There has been long-running controversy as to the location of Uxellodunum. Charles Athanase Walckenaer asserted that Uxellodunum was to be identified with the village of Capdenac on the Lot River.baron de Walckenaer, Géographie ancienne historique et comparée des Gaules cisalpine et transalpine, p 353, Paris, 1862 (1st edition 1839) The site of Cantayrac (Tarn-et-Garonne) was also proposed by Eloi Itard, André Noché and Fernand Réveille; in particular, this site corresponds much more than the others to the description made by Hirtius. Archaeological work has validated the theory that the oppidum in question was at Puy d'Issolud, Vayrac. Weapons have been found thereG. Renoux, F. Dabosi, J.-M. Pailler, « Les armes en fer d'Uxellodunum (Puy d'Issolud, Lot), dernière bataille de César en Gaule : « Étude paléométallurgique de pointes de flèche ettrait de catapulte » (The iron weapons of Uxellodunum (Puy d'Issolud, Lot), the Caesars' last fight in Gaul.

Production  Illawarras produce large quantities of high butter fat and protein milk. In an official test in 1998, Illawarra cows averaged 4,829 litres of milk, with slightly over 4 percent butter fat and 3.4 percent protein, under Australia's pasture production system. According to the 2010 Australian Dairy Herd Improvement Report, the average production of an Illawarra cow is 6733 litres with a butterfat percentage of 3.95% and a protein percentage of 3.29%,  Temperament  Illawarras are very docile cows that are noted for their longevity. They make good handling cattle for shows and are easy to work with in the dairy.  Adaptability  Illawarras can stand weather exceeding 40 degrees Celsius and below 0 degrees Celsius. They make the most out of feed and don't need much supplementary feeding. This adaptability under a variety conditions has contributed to the growth of the breed.

The smaller peaks and valleys may be due to measurement errors rather than discrete spectral lines. In physics, a continuous spectrum usually means a set of attainable values for some physical quantity (such as energy or wavelength) that is best described as an interval of real numbers, as opposed to a discrete spectrum, a set of attainable values that is discrete in the mathematical sense, where there is a positive gap between each value and the next one. The classical example of a continuous spectrum, from which the name is derived, is the part of the spectrum of the light emitted by excited atoms of hydrogen that is due to free electrons becoming bound to a hydrogen ion and emitting photons, which are smoothly spread over a wide range of wavelengths, in contrast to the discrete lines due to electrons falling from some bound quantum state to a state of lower energy. As in that classical example, the term is most often used when the range of values of a physical quantity may have both a continuous and a discrete part, whether at the same time or in different situations. In quantum systems, continuous spectra (as in bremsstrahlung and thermal radiation) are usually associated with free particles, such as atoms in a gas, electrons in an electron beam, or conduction band electrons in a metal. In particular, the position and momentum of a free particle has a continuous spectrum, but when the particle is confined to a limited space its spectrum becomes discrete. Often a continuous spectrum may be just a convenient model for a discrete spectrum whose values are too close to be distinguished, as in the phonons in a crystal. The continuous and discrete spectra of physical systems can be modeled in functional analysis as different parts in the decomposition of the spectrum of a linear operator acting on a function space, such as the Hamiltonian operator.

It involves assessing the resources, skills, and experience available in a community; organizing the community around issues that move its members into action; and then determining and taking appropriate action. This method uses the community's own assets and resources as the basis for development; it empowers the people of the community by encouraging them to utilize what they already possess. The ABCD approach was developed by John L. McKnight and John P. Kretzmann at the Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. They co-authored a book in 1993, Building Communities from the Inside Out: A Path Toward Finding and Mobilizing A Community’s Assets, which outlined their asset-based approach to community development. The Community Development Program at Northwestern University’s Institute for Policy Research established the Asset-Based Community Development Institute based on three decades of research and community work by John P. Kretzmann and John L. McKnight. Principles Needs-based community development emphasizes local deficits and looks to outside agencies for resources. In contrast, asset-based community development focuses on honing and leveraging existing strengths within the community. Related to tenets of empowerment, it postulates that solutions to community problems already exist within a community’s assets. Principles that guide ABCD include: * Everyone has gifts: Each person in a community has something to contribute. * Relationships build a community: People must be connected in order for sustainable community development to take place. * Citizens at the center: Citizens should be viewed as actors—not recipients—in development. * Leaders involve others: Community development is strongest when it involves a broad base of community action. * People care: Challenge notions of \\"apathy\\" by listening to people's interests. * Listen: Decisions should come from conversations where people are heard. * Ask: Asking for ideas is more sustainable than giving solutions. * Inside-out organization: Local community members are in control. * Institutions serve the community: Institutional leaders should create opportunities for community- member involvement, then \\"step back.\\"  Tools  The ABCD approach utilizes several tools to assess and mobilize communities. Capacity inventory # Skills Information: lists the many skills that a person has gained at home, work, in the community, or elsewhere. Examples of these skills can include internet knowledge, hair-cutting, listening, wallpapering, carpentry, sewing, babysitting, etc. # Community Skills: lists the community work in which a person has participated to determine future work they may be interested in. # Enterprising Interests and Experience: lists past experience in business and determines interest in starting a business. # Personal Information: lists minimum information for follow-up. Asset mapping There are five key assets in any given community: individuals, associations, institutions, physical assets, and connections. These assets are broken down into three categories: Gifts of individuals, Citizens’ Associations, and Local Institutions. Asset maps are used in lieu of needs maps which focus solely on negative aspects of communities. Asset maps, on the other hand, focus on community assets, abilities, skills, and strengths in order to build its future. Example asset map Time banks Time banks are an example of using community assets to connect individuals' assets to one another. Neighbors and local organizations share skills with one another and earn and spend ‘TimeBank Hours’ or ‘credits’ in the process, allowing an hour of child care to equal an hour of home repair or tax preparation. Ethics Since ABCD relies on existing community assets to create change, it has been criticized for implying that disadvantaged communities have all the resources they need to solve community problems. According to the ABCD Institute, however, ABCD methodology recognizes that systemic injustice may require disadvantaged communities to seek assistance from outside the community. ABCD maintains that interventions from exterior sources will be most effective when a community’s assets are leveraged at full capacity. ABCD is described as a more sustainable model of community development than needs-based community development, because needs-based approaches may perpetuate community problems by emphasizing deficiencies and the necessity for reliance on outside assistance. By contrast, ABCD aims to build capacity within communities by expanding their social capital. By working with outside resources and simultaneously building trust within the community, more members can make use of a wider array of strengths.

Rove McManus also appears in the film as himself, promoting The Wannabes on his TV show Rove Live. Plot Danny (Nick Giannopoulos) is a talentless, yet clumsy, and therefore awkward entertainer who is hired by Marcus (Russell Dykstra) and his motley crew to turn them into the biggest kids' group since The Wiggles, The Hooley Dooleys, Hi-5, Bananas in Pyjamas, Play School, and Barney the Bear (a parody of Humphrey Bear). But while Danny is training them to become The Wannabes, they're secretly planning to use their new identity as cover to pull off a heist of a diamond necklace from the very rich Aurora Van Dyke (Lena Cruz). Aurora has hosted a party for her grandchild, and booked all the best child entertainers in town to perform, and as The Wannabes prepare for the show, two of the characters steal the necklace. The burglary doesn't go as planned, so they ditch the necklace and escape the scene without being caught. But after the escapade something totally unexpected happens; they end up becoming the hottest kids' band in the country. They even have The Wannabes merchandise and posters, etc.; they release an album and even do a performance on the Australian show Rove Live. Their fame continues to build until Aurora Van Dyke discovers they were the people responsible for trying to steal her necklace.

Luke Buckmaster of In Film Australia wrote \\"This agitating juvenile comedy slides on a downwards trajectory into the wastelands of bad comedy and poor screen writing.

It is named for Tegla Loroupe, a world-champion marathon runner from Kapenguria, Kenya. Mission The foundation's mission is to promote peaceful co-existence and socioeconomic development of poor and marginalized individuals and communities in Northern Kenya and the Greater Horn of Africa Region. History and operations Since its founding in 2003, the foundation has organized annual Peace Races across East Africa, primarily in Kenya and Uganda. Thousands of participants from tribes across the region participate in meetings, peace dialogues and athletic competitions. Violence in the region from cattle rustling and tribal rivalries occurs across an area of tens of thousands of square kilometers. The Peace Races draws participants from hundreds of kilometers away, with the conditions that all warriors participating must lay down their weapons and arrive at the race site prepared to join those with whom they may be at war. Races have taken place in the Tana River area, a constant site of violent tribal and economic warfare; in Kapenguria, in West Pokot; in Moroto, in Uganda. Tribes participating in the races include the Pokot, the Turkana, the Karamajong, the Maraquet, the Orma, and the Pokomo. School The foundation has built a school for orphans affected by the violence in the cattle raising areas of north-west Kenya, eastern Uganda, southern Ethiopia and southern Sudan. Now in operation for over five years, there are 270 students drawn from areas affected by regional violence. Phase one of the curriculum will be for primary levels, with children from six years old to fourteen years old. Phase two will extend classes through higher forms. In 2015, the Tegla Loroupe Peace Academy's top student achieved Kenya Examination score of 381. The school is improving its ranking every year.

It was formerly known as Marikan.Active, of New Bedford, May 23, 1854, Nicholson Whaling Collection #11. History At the time of European contact, Simushir was inhabited by the Ainu. The island appears on an official map showing the territories of Matsumae Domain, a feudal domain of Edo period Japan dated 1644, and these holdings were officially confirmed by the Tokugawa shogunate in 1715. Russian explorer Gerasim Izmailov was marooned on Simushir in the early 1770s. He spent a full year subsisting on \\"scallops, grass, and roots\\". Sovereignty initially passed to Russia under the terms of the Treaty of Shimoda, but was returned to the Empire of Japan per the Treaty of Saint Petersburg along with the rest of the Kuril islands. The island was formerly administered as part of Shimushiru District of Nemuro Subprefecture of Hokkaidō. Settlers on the island were engaged in fishing, and the raising of Arctic fox and reindeer. During World War II, the civilian population was evacuated to the Japanese home islands and Simushir was garrisoned by a detachment from the Imperial Japanese Army. It was surrendered to Soviet forces during the Battle of the Kuril Islands without resistance. Under the Soviet Union, Brouton Bay was used by the Soviet Navy as a secret submarine base between 1987 and 1994, and had a population of approximately 3000 people. The remains of the base can be seen clearly on satellite images. Today the island is uninhabited. It is now administered as part of the Sakhalin Oblast of the Russian Federation. Geology Simushir is highly elongated, consisting of a series of stratovolcanos. The island has a length of with a width of , and an area of . At the north end of the island is a half-submerged caldera, Brouton Bay, with an entrance only 2.5 meters deep, plunging to 240 meters in the center. * Urataman (, , Mikazuki Yama), high and overlooking Brouton Bay, is the northernmost stratovolcano of the island. Further south are: * Prevo (, , Shimushiru Fuji), with a height of . The peak erupted in the early 19th century, forming a symmetrical cone with a resemblance to Mount Fuji. On the summit is a 450 × 600 meter wide summit crater with a small caldera lake on its floor. Lava flows from the summit reach both coasts of central Simushir. Only two eruptions are known from Prevo Peak in historical times. The largest of these, during the 1760s, produced pyroclastic flows that destroyed all vegetation at the foot of the volcano. Weak explosive activity occurred during the most recent eruption, in the early 19th century. * Zavaritzki (, , Midoriko Karudera), with a height of , and a 2 × 3 kilometer fresh water caldera lake.. Several young cones and lava domes are located near the margins the lake. A lava dome created in the 1916 and 1931 eruptions formed a small island in the northern part of the lake. In 1957, a new 350 meter wide, 40 meter high lava dome was created following explosive eruptions, decreasing the size of the lake. * Milna (, , Shimushiru Dake), with a height of , is the highest point on the island. This volcano erupted in 1881 and in 1914. The outer flanks of the steep-sided mountain are dissected by deep gullies, with lava flows extending to the sea. The three kilometer wide caldera was breached to the south due to glaciations. * Goriaschaia Sopka (, ; Yake Yama), with a height of , is on the southwest end of the island. This volcano erupted in 1881 and in 1914. Climate In spite of its temperate latitude, the powerful Oyashio Current on the western flank of the Aleutian Low gives Simushir a chilly and very wet subarctic climate (Köppen Dfc) that amazingly almost qualifies as a polar climate (ET), which in low-lying areas would be expected only at latitudes about 20 degrees or further north. Unlike typical subarctic or polar climates, however, the winters are only moderately severe and there is no permafrost since the mean annual temperature is around , whilst temperatures have never fallen below . However, the extreme winds, which in winter average as much as , make it feel much colder.OSTROV SIMUSHIR, RUSSIA Summers are mild, but extraordinarily cloudy with fogs occurring on six-sevenths of all days in summer and annual sunshine hours less than 1,100 per year, which is comparable to Reykjavík or the extremely foggy Sichuan Basin. Sunshine is actually most likely in the wettest months of September and October when the heavy rain removes the low- level fog, but clear days are extremely rare at any time of year. Fauna In the spring crested and least auklet, Leach's storm petrel, and Japanese cormorant nest on the island.Kondratyev, A. Y., Litvinenko, N. M., Shibaev, Y. V., Vyatkin, P. S., & Kondratyeva, L.

History The castle was originally built in the second half of the 13th century in the Kingdom of Hungary. It was completely reconstructed by the Thurzó family, owners of the castle from 1524. The last owner was Miklós Bercsényi, general of the anti- Habsburg insurrection army during Rákóczi's War of Independence. The castle fell into ruins after it was besieged in 1710 as a part of the suppression of the anti-Habsburg uprising. A trove of axe-shaped iron coins from the Great Moravian period was found in the Hrádok area.

It is native to eastern North America.  Description  The species can grow up to . They have a fusiform body shape with silvery sides with blue and green lateral iridescent stripes and transparent fins. Their pectoral and pelvic fins are in the abdominal region. They have a pointed snout with a terminal mouth position. The caudal fin is angled inwards to make a forked shape. Breeding males have red colorations on their face, head, and behind the gills. Breeding females will also have minimal red colorations.  Distribution  The rosyface shiner's native range is in the eastern United States and southern Canada. They are found from eastern Wisconsin and in the drainages of the Great Lakes to New York, down south in the upper Ohio River, along the Appalachian Mountains and Cumberland Plateau to Tennessee, and down the James river, and Rapidan River which drain into the Atlantic Ocean. Orange areas of map show rosyface shiner distribution across the continental United States Habitat They are freshwater fish living in large to moderate-sized streams with clear waters and fast flowing currents. Bottoms of streams have clean gravel or rubble usually in or around riffles. They are not conducive to streams with consistently murky waters. They are nonmigratory spending winters (mid- November)in deeper pools and eddies and then returning to the riffles in mid-March.  Diet  The rosyface shiner is an omnivorous fish and has been reported to eat insects such as caddis fly larvae, mayfly nymphs, diptera, fish eggs, algae, diatoms, and other organic material, although insects make up a large majority of its diet. They are known to feed on insects on the surface of the water including terrestrial insects that fall into the water, but will also feed in mid-waters as well. They have even been known to jump out of the water to capture flying insects. In a study conducted by Roger J. Reed in 1957 rosyface shiners were reported to have 20% of fish with full stomachs during the months of late April to late May during pre-spawning activities. Feeding activities then picked back up again post-spawning in mid-June with 80% of the population having full stomachs. Reproduction Pre-spawning activities include schools of both sexes circling between two pools below spawning riffles. The front of the school consists of females while the back of the school consists of males. Spawning takes place on a riffle at the head of the pool. Spawning area was over gravel at the bottom in the lower part of a riffle where water was 1 to 3 inches deep. Depressions 5 to 12 inches in diameter served as nests. Fish will vibrate together over a depression for 5 to 6 seconds, rest for 30 seconds and then repeat the cycle for about 5 minutes and then return to the pool, this cycle is repeated every 10 minutes. Both sexes are sexually mature after 1 year of life. One year old females have a fecundity of about 600 eggs and 3-year-old females have an average fecundity of 1,175. They live to be 3 years old.

Its name is derived from the Ainu language, from “Konbu village”. Geology Shiashkotan is roughly dumbbell shaped, formed by two volcanic islands joined together by a narrow landspit. The island has a total length of with a width ranging from at its widest point to at its narrowest, and an area of . Both ends of the island are complex stratovolcanos, and landing is possible only on the sandy isthmus. * Pik Sinarka (; ; Kurodake), which rises to above sea level occupies the northern end of the island, and is the island’s highest point. Historical eruptions have occurred at Sinarka during 1825–1750, 1846, 1855, and the last and largest from 1872 to 1878. To the east from this volcano is located interesting geothermal field - North-Western solfatara field with more than 100 fumaroles and several hot, geyser-like springs which erupt water up to 1.5 m high. * Pik Kuntomintar -(; ; Kitaiō- dake), occupies the southern end of the island. A central cone fills a 4-4.5 kilometer diameter caldera, and there is a second caldera on the west side which is breached to the west. The only known postglacial activity of Kuntomintar is continuous fulmarole activity near the east wall of the inner caldera and a nearby hot sulfur spring. History Shiashkotan was inhabited by the Ainu, who subsided off of hunting and fishing at the time of European contact. The island appears on an official map showing the territories of Matsumae Domain, a feudal domain of Edo period Japan dated 1644, and these holdings were officially confirmed by the Tokugawa shogunate in 1715. Subsequently, claimed by the Empire of Russia, sovereignty initially passed to Russia under the terms of the Treaty of Shimoda. During an eruption of 1872, Russian authorities recorded that 13 inhabitants died; however, when the island was returned to the Empire of Japan per the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875) along with the rest of the Kuril islands, no inhabitants remained as they had chosen to move north to Kamchatka, which remained under the Russian jurisdiction. The island was formerly administered as part of Shimushu District of Nemuro Subprefecture of Hokkaidō. In 1893, a settlement was attempted by nine members of the Chishima Protective Society led by Gunji Shigetada; however, when a ship called on the island a year later, five of the colonists had already died, and the remaining four were critically ill with beri-beri. After World War II, the island came under the control of the Soviet Union, and is now administered as part of the Sakhalin Oblast of the Russian Federation.

The two share robust economic ties, with Saudi Arabia representing Canada's second largest trading partner in the Middle East, a relation that was bolstered in February 2014 with the purchase of C$15 billion worth of Canadian arms by Saudi Arabia. Until August 2018, there were over 16,000 Saudi students on government scholarships in Canada. Relations between the two have gradually soured after a diplomatic row which was sparked by the Canadian government's call for the immediate release of blogger Raif Badawi and his sister Samar via Twitter on 5 August 2018 over human rights concerns. In response, Saudi Arabia accused Canada of interfering in its internal affairs and expelled the Canadian ambassador to Saudi Arabia in Riyadh, declaring him persona non grata and giving him 48 hours to leave the country. It also recalled its own ambassador from Ottawa, suspended all new trade (except oil sales), froze all Saudia flights to and from Toronto and cancelled scholarships for thousands of Saudi students in Canada.  Diplomatic visits  In April 2000, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien made a state visit to Saudi Arabia.  Diplomatic relations  In a meeting held in Ottawa in December 2015, Canadian Foreign Minister Stéphane Dion met with his Saudi counterpart Adel al-Jubeir to discuss matters pertaining to human rights in Saudi Arabia. During the meeting, the Saudi government's detainment of human rights activist Raif Badawi was brought up. Following the 2016 Saudi Arabia mass execution in which 47 civilians convicted of terrorism were executed, Stéphane Dion requested that Saudi Arabia respect due process and to follow international norms in regards to human rights. Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland. The Canadian Foreign Ministry also voiced concerns over the possibility that these executions could renew sectarian friction in the Middle East.  Economic relations  Saudi Arabia is Canada's 17th largest trading partner. Saudi Arabia imported $1.5 billion worth of Canadian goods in 2015 according to the World Bank. Canada imported $1.5 billion worth of Saudi goods in 2015. From the end of 2012 until the middle of 2018, Saudi Arabia had become Canada's second largest export market in the Middle East. Much like Israel, most of the success of the former Canadian-Saudi relations was attributable to opposition to Iran and other countries in the region. On the bilateral relations with Saudi Arabia, economic and trade interests used to be at the forefront of all discussions and meetings. Several private Islamic schools in Canada have been directly financed by Saudi Arabia to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars. This has proved controversial, with detractors claiming that these schools can be used to propagate Saudi Arabia's strict form of Islam known as Wahhabism.  Military relations  During the Gulf War, both Canadian and Saudi forces cooperated with the coalition forces to quell the invasion of Kuwait and the advancement of the Iraqi military. In February 1991, Canada opened up a field hospital in Saudi Arabia in the north- eastern village of Qaisumah to treat both coalition and Iraqi troops. Both countries reached in an agreement in February 2014 under which Saudi Arabia would purchase C$15 billion worth of military equipment from Canada. According to the CBC, this deal included 928 light armoured vehicles, specifically, a model known as LAV-6. Among these LAV-6s, 119 were categorized as heavy assault. Also included under this deal is a 14-year provision of technical assistance. This deal solidified Saudi Arabia as the second-largest export destination for Canadian arms after the US. The CBC reported that the first shipment of vehicles would arrive in Saudi Arabia by 2017. This deal immediately came under fire from numerous Canadian politicians and news outlets who believed that the vehicles may be misused by Saudi Arabia to commit human rights violations, particularly against its minority Shiite population. Furthermore, when Saudi Arabia invaded Yemen in 2015, questions were raised over whether the vehicles would be used against Yemeni civilians. Although the deal was penned by Stephen Harper's conservative government, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau gave the go-ahead for the deal to proceed in April 2016 when he assigned permits allowing for the export of the vehicles. When Trudeau was confronted about the possibility of Saudi Arabia using the vehicles against its civilian population, he stated that he was obliged to respect the deal made by his predecessor. In August 2017, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland initiated an investigation into Saudi usage of Canadian-made vehicles and in February 2018 the investigative team concluded that there was no definitive evidence that Saudi Arabia had ever inflicted human rights abuses using vehicles originating from Canada. A panel of independent experts monitoring the Yemen conflict for United Nations, included the name of Canada in their report for the period ending in June, 2020, in fueling the war in Yemen by selling weapons to Saudi Arabia that were later used in the Yemen war causing the biggest humanitarian crisis. In response, a letter dated 17 September was sent to Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau by 39 human rights, arms-control and labor groups, urging to stop arms sales to Saudi Arabia.v  Educational relations  The Saudi Arabian Cultural Bureau in Canada (SACB), launched in May 1978 as a subsidiary of the Saudi Ministry of Education, is responsible for the management of Saudi students in Canada. One of its most important departments is its academic relations unit, which controls the submission of important documents to Canadian universities, such as transcripts and admission documents, and is also active in organizing official visits and signing cooperative agreements. Other departments of the SACB include an English language preparation unit and an admissions unit, which provides enrolment advice to Saudi students and monitors the status of admissions. There were more than 15,000 Saudi students in Canada in 2007, including 800 resident physicians and specialists who provided care to the Canadian population, offsetting Canadian aid to Saudis. In 2015, Saudi Arabian students represented 3% of total foreign students in Canada. Official figures provided by the SACB indicated that in 2014 there were 16,000 Saudi scholarship students in Canada and 1,000 medical trainees. In mid 2018, most educational ties were downgraded.  Cultural relations  Saudi National Day celebrations take place annually in the Canadian capital of Ottawa on 23 September. They are organized by the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Ottawa in collaboration with the Saudi Arabian Cultural Bureau in Canada.  Other relations  In 2000, Canadian William Sampson was arrested by the Saudi government for complicity in a suicide bombing in Riyadh, while maintaining his innocence. He was imprisoned and later criticized the Canadian government for not coming to his aid. He was freed by British intervention after being imprisoned for two years. Since 2006, a Canadian citizen Nathalie Morin is stuck in Saudi Arabia with an abusive husband, fighting to go back to Canada along with her four children. With the on-going escalated tensions between Saudi Arabia and Canada, the future of Morin remains unclear. According to Morin's mother Johanne Durocher, Morin is cut off from the world, locked in an apartment in Dammam, victim of physical, psychological and sexual violence from her spouse. Durocher has not had any contact with her daughter or grandchildren since August 2018. In March 2008, Canadian citizen Mohamed Kohail was sentenced to death in Saudi Arabia over the killing of a 19-year old. His death sentence was revoked in 2010, and he was released in December 2012. During Kohail's imprisonment, several Canadian diplomats visited Saudi Arabia on Kohail's behalf.  August 2018 diplomatic dispute   Background  Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland issued a statement via Twitter on 2 August 2018 expressing Canada's concern over the recent arrest of Samar Badawi, a human rights activist and sister of imprisoned Saudi activist Raif Badawi. Freeland advocated their release. Other Canadian diplomats and the Canadian Embassy in Riyadh later released statements of their own in which they called for the release of all peaceful human rights activists detained in the kingdom.  The Saudi reaction  In response to Canada's criticism, the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs published an official statement in which it \\"expressed disbelief\\" in the comments made by Freeland and the Canadian Embassy in Riyadh, which it considered to \\"not be based in any accurate or true information\\". The Ministry went on to denounce the statements as \\"blatant interference in the Kingdom's domestic affairs\\". The Saudi government suspended all new trade and investment relations with Canada and expelled Canada's ambassador; it named Dennis Horak as persona non grata and gave him 24 hours to leave the country. Saudi Arabia also said it would recall its envoy to Canada temporarily but a statement said the country maintained \\"its right to take further action\\". The Saudi freeze on all new trade with Canada included instructing staff to sell off all Canadian holdings, including equities, bonds and cash even if that means doing so at a loss. Saudi Arabia announced on 8 August that it would put a halt to its medical programs in Canada and move all Saudi patients receiving care in Canadian hospitals to hospitals in other countries. By that date, Saudi Arabia had begun selling all its Canadian assets to foreign investors. Saudi students studying in Canada on Saudi Arabian scholarships were ordered to relocate to another country or risk losing financial assistance. Roughly 16,000 students were sponsored by such scholarships at the time of this decree. For the 2018–2019 school year, the University of Toronto has 216 postgraduate medical residents and fellows and 77 undergraduate students while University of Western Ontario has 75 undergraduate and graduate students. Western University also created a checklist for the students who have been ordered to leave Canada by 31 August 2018. The state airline Saudia declared that all flights would be suspended from King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh and King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah to and from Toronto Pearson International Airport as of 13 August. As part of the economic sanctions, the Saudi Grains Organization (SAGO) advised that it would no longer accept wheat or barley of Canadian origin. However, an official statement from Energy Minister Khalid A. Al-Falih indicated that the diplomatic crisis would not impact the sale of oil to Canada by Saudi Aramco. In response to suggestions in the news media about the possibility of outside mediation, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said on 8 August that his country would not engage in negotiations until Canada retracted its original statement calling for the release of human rights activists. The Toronto Star reported that the consensus among analysts indicated that the actions taken by Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman were a \\"warning to the world — and to Saudi human rights activists — that his Saudi Arabia is not to be trifled with\\". In an interview with a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation programme, Iyad el-Baghdadi, President of the Al-Kawakibi Democracy Transition Center (an NGO) made this prediction as to the future of the relationship between the two countries. \\"Mohammad bin Salman has a tendency to start large actions that end up as quagmires, and I think unfortunately this is going to last for a while\\", and noted that while this was the first time Saudi Arabia had reacted this way to a western country, such reactions from Saudi Arabia had become \\"routine within the region\\". On 27 August, the Saudi Ministry of Education informed the 1,053 Saudi medical residents and fellows in Canada that they can \\"continue in their positions\\" and they no longer have to leave Canada by 31 August. According to Canadian-based Global News, Saudi state-owned television Al Arabiya \\"has suggested that Canada is the worst country in the world for women, that it has the highest suicide rate and that it treats its Indigenous people the way Myanmar treats the Rohingya – a Muslim minority massacred and driven out of Myanmar en masse\\" which was described by Global News as \\"fake news\\" published by the Saudi television outlet.  Controversial image  A Saudi Arabian youth organization named \\"Infographic KSA\\" uploaded an image to Twitter on 6 August of a passenger plane flying towards the CN Tower in the skyline of Toronto. It was widely perceived as a threat of a terrorist attack by western media as an allusion to the September 11 attacks in which 15 of the 19 hijackers were citizens of Saudi Arabia. The group immediately deleted the post and released a public apology to \\"those who were offended\\", explaining that the picture was not meant to represent a terrorist attack and was instead meant to symbolize Canadian ambassador Dennis Horak's flight back to Canada. The Ministry of Culture and Information of Saudi Arabia launched an investigation into the incident and ordered the group to suspend its Twitter account.  Canada's response  Foreign Minister Freeland responded to the expulsion of Ambassador Horak at a press conference on 6 August. \\"Canada will always stand up for human rights in Canada and around the world, and women's rights are human rights.\\" On 8 August, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters that he refused to apologize for his country's involvement in promoting human rights, saying that \\"Canadians have always expected our government to speak strongly, firmly and politely about the need to respect human rights around the world\\" and that Canada will continue to \\"speak strongly, firmly and politely\\" about this issue. \\"We will continue to stand up for Canadian values and human rights. It's something that I will always do\\", he added. In another comment about the \\"diplomatic difference of opinion\\", Trudeau said his country would continue a relationship with Saudi Arabia. \\"We have respect for their importance in the world and recognise that they have made progress on a number of important issues. Former Conservative Foreign Minister John Baird appeared on Saudi Al Arabiya television to comment on the dispute and urged Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to fly to Riyadh to apologize in person to the Saudi royal family. Baird was working as a consultant and has business interests in Saudi Arabia at the time he made the comments, but in January 2015 while Foreign Affairs Minister, he had also protested Raif Badawi's case to the Saudis, specifically with Prince Turki bin Faisal Al Saud, a prominent member of the Saud family. NDP MP Charlie Angus called the appearance \\"stunning\\" and suggested that the Ethics Commissioner should investigate the incident.  Economic effects  There was some question as to how the Saudi sell-off would affect Canada's economy; year to date, Canada had exported C$1.4 billion in goods to Saudi Arabia, according to Statistics Canada. Middle East expert Rex Brynen of McGill University predicted that negative short-term economic effects were possible, but that the strategy would \\"mostly hurt Saudi-owned firms\\". Canadian grain farmers were concerned, however. The president of Cereals Canada said that barley trade especially would be affected since Saudi Arabia accounted for seven per cent of the annual exports; wheat sales were much more modest. An analyst with LeftField Commodity Research said in an interview with Reuters that \\"there will be plenty of opportunities for Canada to sell barley and wheat elsewhere\\". Global supplies of grain were already becoming tighter due to weather-related issues in Russia, Europe, and Australia. The former Canadian Wheat Board, now G3, is partly owned by the Saudi Arabian agriculture company SALIC. The value of the Canadian dollar dropped slightly, but, on 8 August, it reached its highest level in over seven weeks due to data indicating economic growth and record high exports in recent months. The total impact of the Saudi sell-off on Canadian currency should be \\"ephemeral\\" according to Bipan Rai, Executive Director and North America Head of FX Strategy at CIBC Capital Markets. The 800 to 1000 medical trainees sponsored by Saudi Arabia, who were at the Resident and Fellow level, were providing direct care to Canadian patients at no cost to the healthcare system. Hospitals were uncertain as to how these services could be replaced if the trainees were to leave Canada. As of late August 2018, they were allowed to remain until \\"an alternative assignment can be arranged\\", according to the Saudi Ministry of Education.  International reaction  After the incident, the Saudi government has received official backing from the vast majority of the Arab league, while Canada received support from some MEPs. The day after Saudi Arabia downgraded ties, Yemen's Hadi government, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain expressed support to Saudi Arabia. The Arab Interior Ministers Council and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) secretary general Abdullatif bin Rashid Al Zayani in a statement expressing GCC reaction, condemned any interference in Saudi Arabia's sovereignty. However, Qatar, a GCC member, distanced itself from the remarks made by Al Zayani and stated that his comments \\"do not reflect its opinion\\" while mentioning that it maintains cordial relations with Canada. Several countries indicated support for the measures taken by Saudi Arabia on 7 August, including the Palestinian Authority government of Palestine, Jordan, Djibouti, Mauritania, and Sudan. On 8 August, three more countries professed solidarity with the Saudi position: Egypt, Comoros, and Lebanon. Russia was critical of Canada, with Maria Zakharova of the Russian Foreign Ministry criticizing Canada for \\"politicizing human rights\\". Official support for the Saudi position was also expressed by Pakistan. and Somalia. Oman and Kuwait reprimanded Canada for what they considered meddling, but also conveyed their desires for hasty resolution of the dispute. Canada's NATO ally Turkey backed Saudi Arabia in its dispute with Canada, rejecting the Canadian actions as a \\"form of interference in other countries’ internal affairs\\". The United States declared that it would not get involved in the dispute. State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said: \\"It is up for the Government of Saudi Arabia and the Canadians to work this out. Both sides need to diplomatically resolve this together. We cannot do it for them.\\" Sources told Reuters on 6 August that Canada was seeking help from its allies the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates to defuse the diplomatic dispute. The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office urged restraint from both sides of the dispute and said that it had raised its concerns about the recent arrest of human rights defenders to the Saudi Arabian government. A Bloomberg article on 10 August cited an unnamed \\"senior U.S. official\\" as stating that unspecified persons were trying to do behind-the-scenes damage control. It is believed that the Canadian government received support from the British, German and Swedish governments through back-channels.

With fellow U.S. Marine David Karnes, he helped find a pair of Port Authority Police officers buried in the rubble of the World Trade Center. Career 2001: September 11 attacks On September 11, 2001, Thomas was dropping his daughter off at the home of his mother on Long Island when she told him planes had struck the towers. The 27-year-old Thomas, having left active duty in August 2001, quickly put on his Marine uniform, sped to Manhattan, and had just parked his car when the North Tower of the World Trade Center collapsed. Thomas told the Associated Press: Thomas ran into another Marine veteran, Staff Sgt. David Karnes. Thomas presented a plan for a search-and-rescue mission of the area, and he and Karnes tried to enlist other marines and soldiers on site to help. When they were told the mission was too dangerous, they decided to go by themselves. \\"I found a couple guys, but it wasn't enough, to them, to start a search and rescue,\\" he said. \\"I remember myself and Karnes saying, 'We're going to start the search and rescue with or without you, because someone needs us.'\\" Carrying little more than an infantryman's shovel, they climbed the mountain of debris, skirting dangerous crevasses and shards of red-hot metal, calling out, \\"Is anyone down there? United States Marines!\\" It was dark before they heard a response. They met an operating engineer, who had a flashlight, and crawled down into the hole where the 2 cops were trapped, and spoke with Will. Then the engineer climbed out, and went for help, and brought back the FDNY. Thomas said he returned to Ground Zero every day to pitch in, before attempting to put the events behind him. He did not even tell his five children about his rescues. He had identified himself to Karnes and others only as \\"Sergeant Thomas\\". Thomas served in the United States Air Force as a medical technician since 2006. In popular culture Thomas was portrayed in Oliver Stone's feature film World Trade Center by William Mapother. This portrayal by a white actor generated controversy, although the producers claimed that they were unaware that the real Thomas was black until they had already started filming . On February 11, 2007, Extreme Makeover: Home Edition aired a special two-hour episode about Thomas and his family. Following the attacks, Thomas and his wife had moved their four children from New York to Whitehall, Ohio. The house they bought began to deteriorate and the show intervened to help them. On September 2, 2013, Channel 4 broadcast The Lost Hero of 9/11 which detailed Thomas involvement in the rescue operation following the collapse of both towers. After 9/11 As of 2018, Thomas was living in Whitehall, Ohio with his wife Kirsti and their children. He works as an officer for the Ohio Supreme Court as well as being a Technical Sergeant in the United States Air Force.

Captain Henry James Snow reported that in 1883 some 15,000 northern fur seals inhabited the island. However, by the 1890s only \\"a few scores\\" were recorded captured there, almost certainly due to overexploitation by fur hunters. Currently no fur seals reproduce on Raikoke. Raikoke Island as seen from the Golovnin Strait History Raikoke was visited by hunting and fishing parties of the Ainu, but there was no permanent habitation at the time of European contact. The island appears on an official map showing the territories of Matsumae Domain, a feudal domain of Edo Japan dated 1644, and these holdings were officially confirmed by the Tokugawa shogunate in 1715. It was subsequently claimed by the Russian Empire; sovereignty initially passed to Russia under the terms of the Treaty of Shimoda, but was returned to the Empire of Japan per the Treaty of Saint Petersburg along with the rest of the Kuril islands. The island was formerly administered as part of Shimushu District of Nemuro Subprefecture of Hokkaidō. After World War II, it came under the control of the Soviet Union, and is now administered as part of the Sakhalin Oblast of Russia.

The precise form of the constitutional documents depends upon the type of entity.  Companies  By convention, most common law jurisdictions divide the constitutional documents of companies into two separate documents:Although, for example, in Australia, a company has a single consolidated corporate constitution. *the Memorandum of Association (in some countries referred to as the Articles of Incorporation) is the primary document, and will generally regulate the company's activities with the outside world, such as the company's objects and powers. *the Articles of Association (in some countries referred to as the by-laws) is the secondary document, and will generally regulate the company's internal affairs and management, such as procedures for board meetings, dividend entitlements etc.In the event of any inconsistency, the Memorandum usually prevails, see Ashbury v Watson (1885) 30 Ch D 376 In many countries, only the primary document is filed, and the secondary document remains private. In other countries, both documents are filed. In civil law jurisdictions, the company's constitution is normally consolidated into a single document, often called the charter. It is quite common for members of a company to supplement the corporate constitution with additional arrangements, such as shareholders' agreements, whereby they agree to exercise their membership rights in a certain way. Conceptually a shareholders' agreement fulfills many of the same functions as the corporate constitution, but because it is a contract, it will not normally bind new members of the company unless they accede to it somehow.Shalfoon v Cheddar Valley [1924] NZLR 561 One benefit of shareholders' agreement is that they will usually be confidential, as most jurisdictions do not require shareholders' agreements to be publicly filed. Another common method of supplementing the corporate constitution is by means of voting trusts, although these are relatively uncommon outside of the United States and certain offshore jurisdictions...  Partnerships  Partnerships also have constitutional documents in the form of a partnership agreement. In some jurisdictions, a more formal constitution, sometimes referred to as articles of partnership or a partnership deed is used (particularly where the partnership has certain corporate aspects, such as a Limited Liability Partnership). However, many partnerships are not created formally, and may have no written partnership agreement and leave the regulation of the partnership to be regulated in accordance with the understandings of the parties and by general law. Some of the largest partnerships in the world have no written partnership agreement.The best example is probably the leading English magic circle law firm, Slaughter and May.  Trusts  A trust is not a separate legal entity as such, but is often treated as one for certain legal purposes. Like partnerships, trusts are not normally required to have a written trust instrument to constitute them,Although some jurisdictions require one in specific instances, for example, where the trust property include land. although most large and formal trusts do.  Unincorporated associations  An unincorporated association may also have a constitution which provides for the rights and remedies of the members as between themselves, and governs the conduct of the association. Because, in most legal systems, unincorporated associations do not have separate legal personality, this aspect of the constitutional documents is not applicable. In most legal systems unincorporated associations are not required to have formal written constitutions, but many of the larger and more complex organisations would be almost impossible to administer without one.For example, many trade unions and political parties have many millions of members, and would be almost impossible to run without clear internal regulations.

The priory church was consecrated in 1361 and continues in use as the parish church of Saint Mary, Saint Katharine and All Saints.  History   Early history  When Edington was recorded in Domesday Book of 1086 it was held by Romsey Abbey. There was almost certainly a church from before that time, although the earliest record is from 1241. Remains of a late-Norman church were found during restoration in the 19th century. North Bradley was a chapelry of Edington at this time.  William Edington  William Edington (d. 1366), from an Edington family, became Treasurer of England and bishop of Winchester, and founded a chantry at Edington in 1351 in order to have prayers said for himself, his parents and his brother. The church was transferred from Romsey to the chantry, and William gave further funds and properties in the following years.  Monastery  In 1358 the chantry became a house of the Brothers of Penitence or Bonhommes, an Augustinian order. The establishment was modelled on Ashridge Priory, the order's first house in England. The chantry's property was transferred to the new foundation and William, with others, added many manors to its wealth until his death in 1366. The first rector, brought from Ashridge, was John de Aylesbury. At the time of his death in 1382 the brethren were eighteen in number. During Jack Cade's rebellion in 1450, William Ayscough, Bishop of Salisbury and confessor to Henry VI, was forced to flee Salisbury. Seeking refuge in the church at Edington, he was discovered on 29 June, dragged from the high altar during mass and murdered in the fields outside the church. Little is known of the monastery's history until the Dissolution: the house was surrendered in 1539 and in 1541 most of its estates were obtained by Sir Thomas Seymour.  Monastery remains  The site of the monastery, north and northeast of the parish church, is a scheduled ancient monument. Besides the church, five surviving structures are recognised by Historic England; all except the fishpond are Grade I listed.  House called The Priory  Immediately north of the church, a late medieval house which may incorporate parts of the monastic buildings. Rebuilt 1600, later alterations.  Remains of priory  North and east of the church, two large rectangular gardens enclosed by walls approximately 3-4 metres high, probably from the monastery, altered early 17th century. One wall has cylindrical piers which may be the remains of a cloister.  Cottage built onto former monastic wall  Northeast of the church, on the road which leads to Steeple Ashton. A cottage named The Monastery Garden, possibly 16th century, built into a stretch of wall which may have monastic origins.  Fishpond  A large rectangular fishpond, north of the church, which may be monastic in origin. Other adjacent ponds have been filled in.  Ladywell conduit head  Ladywell, Edington About 400 metres southwest of the church, a small 14th- century building over the Ladywell spring, with stone water troughs. A conduit carried water to the monastery.  Parish church  The church still stands today, a good example of the transition between the decorated and perpendicular style of church-building. Pevsner writes \\"A wonderful church and a highly important church. It is so varied in its skyline and so freely embattled that it looks like a fortified mansion ...\\". The whole 14th-century church survives, with its interior enhanced in the 17th century, and restoration by Charles Edward Ponting in 1888-91. It was listed as Grade I in 1968. The church has medieval glass and contains the burial monuments of several local notables, including tombs removed from St Giles at Imber during the early 1950s, following the evacuation of that village in 1943. In 2014 a new organ by Harrison & Harrison was installed. Every August since 1956 a festival of church music, the Edington Festival of Music within the Liturgy, is held here.

Description The island is approximately in length along an east–west axis and approximately at its widest point along a north–south axis. It encompasses an area of approximately . The island is only offshore, with a smaller island, Round Island, between Koolan and the mainland. Composed of Precambrian quartzite sandstone, the island has a rugged dissected terrain with jointed gorge forming narrowly valley drainage channels. The ridges have thin stony sandy soils. The highest point of the island is at . BHP era BHP subsidiary Australian Iron and Steel commenced open-pit mining operations on Koolan and neighbouring Cockatoo Island in 1951, shipping ore on company-owned ships to Port Kembla. By 1963 it had established substantial mining operations there. The Koolan Island mine closed in 1994 after BHP had extracted 68 million tonnes of high-grade haematite ore, averaging 67% iron. At its peak, Koolan Island had a population of 950 people and had a school, police station, recreation facilities and shops. It had the world's then-longest golf course hole – an 860 yards par 7 number 6 which doubled as the island's air strip. Major rehabilitation of the island was undertaken after the mine closure, with buildings and exotic vegetation removed. Extensive replanting of native species has been undertaken. Mine When BHP ceased mining operations on the island in 1993 they flooded the Main Pit to the ocean by blasting part of the hanging wall. This has meant that the pit has been filled with approximately 10 billion litres of sea water, with a significant marine eco-system forming within the bounds of the former working pit. Due to the dense nature of the marine fauna within the Main Pit, Mount Gibson Iron plan to utilise numerous substantial blasts within the water filled pit in order to extract all marine creatures before dewatering operations are commenced. A Seawall will then be built around the ocean side of the pit in order to keep the ocean out. The pit will subsequently be dewatered in order to allow the rich ore reserves to be mined once again. Earlier, in April 2006, the company signed a co-existence agreement with the Dambimangari (Dambima-Ngardi) indigenous Australian traditional owners of the island.Aztec Resources media release The agreement aims to ensure that 3% of the 220 person workforce is filled by indigenous people by the eighth year of operation. A third island nearby, Irvine Island is also being considered for mining operations. On 18 August 2006, Aztec announced that it had signed orders with the Chinese group CITIC for 1.5 million tonnes of ore from 2007. In 2014, the main seawall failed and the mine was flooded. The seawall was rebuilt and reinforced and the pit is being dewatered again as of August 2018.Shipments of iron ore to China recommenced April 2019. Aircraft crash On 23 December 1984, a single-engined Cessna 210 aircraft, which had just taken off from the island en route to Broome, struck power lines and somersaulted. Six people were killed. It appears the aircraft may have been overloaded with passengers and fuel at the time. The plane took off with the wind from the south across the strip rather than over the ocean and submarine rock. The gravel strip at the time had been affected by a cyclone in the area on the previous days. Footnotes References * A Job well done : the Koolan Island achievement. Perth, W.A.

Biography Mutaguchi was a native of Saga Prefecture. He graduated from the 22nd class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1910 and from the 29th class of the Army Staff College in 1917. Mutaguchi served in the Japanese forces with the Siberian Intervention against the Bolshevik Red Army in the Russian Far East. Afterwards, he was sent as a military attaché to France.Budge, The Pacific War ONline Encyclopedia Promoted to major in 1926 and colonel in 1930, from 1933-1936 he served in the General Affairs Section of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff in Tokyo, before being transferred to China in 1936 to take command of the Japanese garrison force in Beijing. He was commander of the IJA 1st Infantry Regiment in China from 1936–1938. Units responsible to Mutaguchi were involved in the Marco Polo Bridge Incident of 7 July 1937, which helped launch the Second Sino-Japanese War. Mutaguchi was promoted to major general in 1938, and served as Chief of Staff of the Fourth Army from 1938-1939. He was then recalled to Japan and served from 1939-1941 as Commandant of the Military Preparatory School.Ammenthorp, The Generals of World War II Promoted to lieutenant general in 1940, with the start of the Pacific War, Mutaguchi was given command of the 18th Division in April 1941. This division was active in the invasion of Malaya in the early stages of the war, and Mutaguchi himself was wounded during the Battle of Singapore in February 1942. After the fall of Singapore, the 18th Division was transferred to the Philippines to reinforce units pushing the remaining American forces down the Bataan Peninsula. In April 1942, the 18th Division was reassigned to Burma. Mutaguchi was then made commander of the Fifteenth Army from March 1943, and strongly pushed forward his own plan to advance into Assam, leading to the Battle of Imphal. After the failure of the Imphal offensive in May 1944, Mutaguchi refused to allow his divisional commanders to retreat, and instead dismissed all three of them. He eventually called off the attack on 3 July. Some 55,000 of Mutaguchi's 85,000-man force ended up as casualties, many dying from starvation or disease. This was the worst defeat to that time suffered by the Japanese army. With the complete collapse of the offensive, Mutaguchi was relieved of command on 30 August and recalled to Tokyo. He was forced into retirement in December 1944.Louis, Burma-The Longest War Mutaguchi was recalled briefly to active service in 1945, to resume his former post as Commandant of the Military Preparatory School. After the end of the war, he was arrested by the American occupation authorities and extradited to Singapore, where he faced a military tribunal which convicted him of war crimes. Released from prison in March 1948, he returned to Japan. Mutaguchi died in Tokyo on 2 August 1966. Popular culture * Portrayed by Kim Ki-joo in the 1991-1992 MBC TV series Eyes of Dawn.

Halič Castle History In historical records, the village was first mentioned in 1299 (Gach) in the records of the Kingdom of Hungary as the location of a very important castle and it was part of the Kingdom until 1920. From 1554 to 1594 it was occupied by Turks. From 1938 to 1945 it again belonged to Hungary. Halič Castle The first appearance in literature of the castle in Halič is from the year 1450. Halič the village was first mentioned as a settlement surrounding this castle in 1299 and titled Holuch, Gach but the castle was only mentioned in passing. The castle was built without any royal permission by magister Tamas from Lučenec. In the years 1450-51 it belonged to the Jiskras, later to János Hunyady before becoming inhabited by King Matthias Corvinus in 1462. In the first half of the 16th century it was in property of Istvan Losonczy. The castle was reconstructed, again without royal permission, by him and was damaged in 1544 during a siege. After the death of Štefan Lučenský, his daughter Anne inherited the county and married Zsigmund Forgách. The Forgáčs were one of the oldest Hungarian aristocratic family being descendants of the Great Moravian family Poznam, who had preserved their positions in Slovakia after its incorporation into the Kingdom of Hungary. The Halič castle was owned by the Forgáčs until 1945. Zsigmond Forgách rebuilt the castle on land which had been part of the estate of the owner of the county since 1598, choosing a site that was both strategic and offering natural fortifications. In 1612 it was repaired carefully and the foundations of an irregular hexagon was laid. On top of these; a storied building with six corner bastions was constructed, secured by a ditch and mounds. Wings of this hexagon led into a courtyard with plain walls, later covered with many murals depicting figures of the Roman emperors and the Hungarian kings between its windows and entrances. At the end of the 17th century Imre Thököly attempted to capture the castle but did not succeed. In 1678, when owned by Adam Forgáč, the castle was besieged again, on this occasion by Turks. The defenders repulsed this attack and also a second attempt in 1703. Six years later Ferenc II Rákóczi overran the castle and in another siege; the leader of the emperor's troops, the General Sigbert Heister, managed to raze parts of the building including the roof and some of the interior equipment. The Forgáčs had the castle reconstructed in 1762 due to the need of a representative seat in this region. The Austrian Andre Meyerhoffer, was in charge of the works, notable as he was the builder of some of the palaces in Bratislava. In 2006, the castle was sold to a development company from Košice who repaired it and made it into a 4 star hotel with a spa.

Periclimenes magnificusii, provides a manicure for a diver. Cleaner shrimp is a common name for a number of swimming decapod crustaceans, that clean other organisms of parasites. They belong to any of three families, Hippolytidae (including the Pacific cleaner shrimp, Lysmata amboinensis), Palaemonidae (including the spotted Periclimenes magnificus) , and Stenopodidae (including the banded coral shrimp, Stenopus hispidus) . The last of these families is more closely related to lobsters and crabs than it is to the remaining families. The term \\"cleaner shrimp\\" is sometimes used more specifically for the family Hippolytidae and the genus Lysmata. Cleaner shrimp are so called because they exhibit a cleaning symbiosis with client fish where the shrimp clean parasites from the fish. The fish benefit by having parasites removed from them, and the shrimp gain the nutritional value of the parasites. The shrimp also eat the mucus and parasites around the wounds of injured fish, which reduces infections and helps healing. The action of cleansing further aids the health of client fish by reducing their stress levels.Shrimp heal injured fish Science Daily, 23 August 2018.Vaughan DB, Alexandra S. Grutter AS, Ferguson HW, Jones R and Hutson KS (2018). \\"Cleaner shrimp are true cleaners of injured fish\\". Marine Biology, 165 (7) In many coral reefs, cleaner shrimp congregate at cleaning stations. In this behaviour cleaner shrimps are similar to cleaner fish, and sometimes may join with cleaner wrasse and other cleaner fish attending to client fish. Shrimp of the genus Urocaridella are often cryptic or live in caves on the reef and are not associated commensally with other animals. These shrimp assemble around cleaning stations where up to 25 shrimp live in proximity. When a potential client fish swims close to a station with shrimp present, several shrimp perform a \\"rocking dance,\\" a side-to-side movement. Frequency of rocking increases with hunger. This increase in frequency suggests competition between hungry and sated shrimp. To avoid competition with other cleaners during the day, the shrimp Urocaridella antonbruunii was observed cleaning a sleeping fish at night. Cleaner shrimps are often included in saltwater aquaria partly due to their cleansing function and partly due to their brightly colored appearance.
