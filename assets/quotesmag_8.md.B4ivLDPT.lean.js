Within the original trilogy, Obi-Wan is a Jedi Master as a supporting character and is portrayed by English actor Alec Guinness. In the later-released prequel trilogy, a younger version of the character serves as one of the two main protagonists alongside Anakin Skywalker and is portrayed by Scottish actor Ewan McGregor. In the original trilogy, he is a mentor to Luke Skywalker, to whom he introduces the ways of the Jedi. After sacrificing himself in a duel against Darth Vader, Obi-Wan guides Luke in his fight against the Galactic Empire. In the prequel trilogy, set decades earlier, he is initially a Padawan (apprentice) to Jedi Master Qui-Gon-Jinn and later the mentor and friend to Luke's father Anakin, who falls to the dark side of the Force and becomes Vader. The character briefly appears in the sequel trilogy as a disembodied voice, speaking to Rey. He is frequently featured as a main character in various other Star Wars media. Guinness' performance as Obi-Wan in the original Star Wars (1977) earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, the only acting nomination for a Star Wars film. McGregor's performance as the character in the prequels received praise as well, considered to be among the highlights of the often criticized trilogy. McGregor is set to return as Obi-Wan in an untitled web series on Disney+ centered on the character that takes place some years after Revenge of the Sith and prior to A New Hope. Guinness won the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in A New Hope, while McGregor was nominated for the same category 20 years later for his performance in The Phantom Menace.  Creation and development  The character is loosely inspired by General Makabe Rokur≈çta, a character from Akira Kurosawa's film The Hidden Fortress, played by Toshiro Mifune (whom franchise creator George Lucas also considered casting as Obi-Wan). In an early draft of the original Star Wars film, Obi-Wan's first meeting with Luke Skywalker is lifted directly from The Hobbit, acknowledging Gandalf as a source of inspiration. Lucas originally planned for Obi-Wan to live through the original film, but found that the character had nothing to do during the culminating battle sequence. Lucas later reflected that he felt that \\"It would be much more powerful, satisfying and interesting if Darth Vader were to kill him and he were to go on to a different form.\\" Appearances Skywalker saga =Original trilogy (1977‚Äì1983)= Obi-Wan Kenobi's Jedi robes from Episode IV Obi-Wan Kenobi is introduced in the original Star Wars film living as a hermit by the name of Ben Kenobi on the planet Tatooine. When Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) travel the desert in search of the lost R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), Obi-Wan rescues them from a band of Tusken Raiders. At Obi- Wan's home, the now-found R2-D2 plays a recording of Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) saying that R2-D2 contains the plans for the Galactic Empire's superweapon: the Death Star. Leia asks him to deliver R2-D2 and the plans safely to her home planet of Alderaan in order to help the Rebel Alliance. Obi-Wan reveals to Luke his secret identity and explains that he is a Jedi, a member of an ancient group of Force-sensitive warriors. He explains that the Jedi were hunted down and exterminated by the Empire with help from his former apprentice, Darth Vader (portrayed by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones), the apparent killer of Luke's father. He gives Luke his father's lightsaber and asks him to accompany him to Alderaan and take up Jedi training. Luke, at first, declines; but after finding that his aunt Beru (Shelagh Fraser) and uncle Owen (Phil Brown) have been killed by Imperial stormtroopers, he realizes he must go with Obi-Wan to Alderaan and to train as a Jedi. At the settlement of Mos Eisley, Obi-Wan uses the Force to trick Imperial troops into letting them through a military checkpoint. They enter a local cantina and meet smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford) alongside the Wookiee Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). Obi-Wan and Luke make a deal to travel to Alderaan aboard their ship, the Millennium Falcon. During the mission, Obi-Wan begins instructing Luke in lightsaber combat. He suddenly becomes worried and tells Luke of \\"a great disturbance in the Force\\". Emerging from hyperspace, the group discovers that Alderaan has been destroyed by the Empire. The Falcon then encounters an Imperial TIE Fighter. They chase the TIE fighter to the Death Star, and subsequently get caught in the space station's tractor beam. On board the Death Star, Obi-Wan ventures through and disables the tractor beam. Not before long, Darth Vader confronts him, and they engage in a lightsaber duel. Obi-Wan uses the duel to distract Vader as Luke, Leia, Han and Chewbacca escape to the Falcon. Obi-Wan allows Vader to strike him down and his body mysteriously vanishes the moment he dies. At the climax of the film, during the Rebel attack on the Death Star, Obi-Wan speaks to Luke through the Force to help him destroy the Imperial station. In The Empire Strikes Back, Obi-Wan Kenobi appears several times as a spirit through the Force. On the ice planet Hoth, he appears to instruct Luke to go to the planet Dagobah to find the exiled Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz). Despite Yoda's skepticism, Obi-Wan convinces his old master to continue Luke's training. Obi- Wan appears later to beseech Luke not to leave Dagobah to try to rescue his friends on Cloud City, although Luke ignores this advice. In Return of the Jedi, Obi-Wan again appears to Luke after Yoda's death on Dagobah. Obi-Wan acknowledges that Darth Vader is indeed Luke's father, revealed by Vader himself in the previous film and confirmed by Yoda on his deathbed, and also reveals that Leia is Luke's twin sister. He urges Luke to confront and defeat Vader; Luke once more rejects his advice. After the Rebels destroy the second Death Star and defeat the Empire, Obi-Wan appears at the celebration on Endor, alongside the spirits of Yoda and the redeemed Anakin Skywalker (Sebastian Shaw). =Prequel trilogy (1999‚Äì2005)= In Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace, set 32 years before A New Hope, a 25-year-old Obi-Wan Kenobi appears as the Padawan apprentice of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson). He accompanies his master in negotiations with the corrupt Trade Federation, which is blockading the planet Naboo with a fleet of spaceships. They fight a swarm of battle droids and stow away on a landing craft en route to Naboo. Once on Naboo, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon rescue Naboo's Queen Padm√© Amidala (Natalie Portman), with help from native Gungan Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best), and escape in a spaceship toward the Republic capital of Coruscant. Their ship is damaged in the escape, causing the hyperdrive generator to malfunction, and they land on Tatooine, where they discover the nine-year-old slave Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd). Qui-Gon believes the boy is the \\"Chosen One\\" prophesied to bring balance to the Force. Anakin joins the group as they travel to Coruscant. While leaving Tatooine, they are attacked by Darth Maul (portrayed by Ray Park, voiced by Peter Serafinowicz), a member of the Sith, a cult of the dark side long thought to be extinct. When Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan return to Naboo to defeat the Trade Federation, they are met again by Maul, who engages them both in lightsaber combat. When Maul mortally wounds Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan storms in to duel Maul, who nearly kills him. However, Obi-Wan manages to turn the tables and defeat Maul, cutting him in half. He promises to fulfill Qui-Gon's dying wish to train Anakin as a Jedi, with or without the council's blessing. Yoda proclaims Obi-Wan a Jedi Knight and reluctantly allows him to take Anakin on as his own Padawan. Ewan McGregor as Kenobi in Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones In Attack of the Clones, set 10 years later, Obi-Wan is now a respected Jedi Knight and the master of Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen). Over the years, Anakin has grown powerful but arrogant, and believes that Obi- Wan is \\"holding him back\\". After they save Padm√©, now a senator, from an assassination attempt, Obi-Wan goes on a solo mission to trace the would-be assassins involved to the planet Kamino. He learns of a massive clone army that the planet's inhabitants are building for the Republic. The clones' template is bounty hunter Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison), and he and Obi-Wan battle once the latter deduces Fett must be behind the attempted assassination. Fett escapes to the planet Geonosis with his clone son Boba (Daniel Logan), unaware that Obi-Wan has pursued them. On Geonosis, Obi-Wan discovers that a conspiracy of star systems bent on secession from the Republic is led by Jedi-turned-Sith Lord Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), Qui- Gon's old master. After sending a message to Anakin, Obi-Wan is captured, interrogated, and sentenced to death by Dooku. Anakin and Padm√© arrive with a cadre of Jedi and the clone army, just in time to prevent the executions. Obi- Wan and Anakin confront Dooku, but the Sith Lord overpowers them both. Yoda intervenes and saves their lives, at the cost of Dooku's escape. In Revenge of the Sith, set three years later, Obi-Wan is now a Jedi Master and a member of the Jedi Council, as well as a General in the Grand Army of the Republic. Anakin, by now a Jedi Knight, remains Obi-Wan's partner, and the two have become war heroes and best friends. The film opens with the two on a rescue mission to save the kidnapped Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from cyborg Separatist commander General Grievous (Matthew Wood) on board his cruiser. Dooku duels the Jedi once again, knocking Obi-Wan unconscious; while Obi-Wan is out cold, Anakin defeats Dooku and executes him on Palpatine's orders. Soon after returning to Coruscant, Obi-Wan travels to planet Utapau to track down Grievous. After finding the Separatist encampment, Obi-Wan fights Grievous and kills him with an abandoned blaster. When Palpatine‚Äîwho is secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, the mastermind of the war‚Äîissues Order 66 to have the clone troopers turn on the Jedi, Obi-Wan survives the attempt on his life and escapes, rendezvousing with Yoda and Senator Bail Organa (Jimmy Smits) of Alderaan aboard Organa's ship, Tantive IV. Returning to Coruscant, he and Yoda discover that every Jedi in the Jedi Temple has been murdered. After sending a beacon to all surviving Jedi to scatter across the galaxy and remain in hiding, a distraught Obi-Wan watches security footage revealing that it was Anakin‚Äîwho is now Sidious' Sith apprentice, Darth Vader‚Äîwho led the chaos. Yoda says that he will confront Sidious, and he charges Obi-Wan with battling Vader. Obi-Wan is loath to fight his best friend, but reluctantly accepts when Yoda says that Anakin Skywalker no longer exists, having been ‚Äúconsumed‚Äù by Vader. Obi-Wan visits Padm√© to question of Vader's whereabouts, and realizes that Vader is her husband and the father of her unborn child. When Padm√© sets out to the volcanic planet Mustafar to confront her husband herself, Obi-Wan secretly stows away aboard her ship. After they arrive on Mustafar, Obi-Wan reveals himself and confronts Vader, who accuses Padm√© and Obi-Wan of conspiring against him and uses the dark side to choke Padm√© into unconsciousness. After a long and ferocious lightsaber duel, Obi-Wan defeats Vader by severing his legs and left arm. Obi-Wan watches in horror as Vader slides too close to a lava flow and catches fire; he then takes his former friend's lightsaber and leaves him to die. Unbeknownst to Obi-Wan, Vader is rescued by Palpatine moments later and reconstructed into the cyborg as first seen in the original trilogy. Obi-Wan takes Padm√© to the asteroid Polis Massa, where she dies after giving birth to twins Luke and Leia. Afterwards, Yoda instructs Obi-Wan to deliver Luke to Anakin's stepbrother Owen Lars (Joel Edgerton) and his wife Beru (Bonnie Piesse) on Tatooine, and reveals that Qui-Gon's spirit has returned to teach him to become one with the Force after death. On Tatooine, Obi-Wan hands Luke off to his step-family and goes into exile to wait until the time is right to challenge Sidious and the newly created Galactic Empire. =Sequel trilogy (2015‚Äì2019)= In The Force Awakens, set 30 years after Return of the Jedi, the protagonist Rey (Daisy Ridley) hears Obi-Wan's voice when she touches the lightsaber that previously belonged to Luke. Obi-Wan calls out to Rey, before saying the words of encouragement he gave to Luke during his training on the Millennium Falcon: \\"These are your first steps.\\" James Arnold Taylor first recorded the lines for this scene, but his recordings were replaced with Ewan McGregor's voice acting. Obi-Wan's line \\"Rey\\" is actually an edited voice recording of actor Alec Guinness saying \\"Afraid\\". In The Last Jedi, Luke indirectly mentions Obi-Wan while talking with Rey about the fall of the Jedi. In The Rise of Skywalker, Rey hears Obi-Wan's voice along with other Jedi from the past as she battles a resurrected Palpatine. Both the voices of McGregor and Guinness are used.  Anthology films  Obi-Wan is referenced indirectly in the 2016 film Rogue One. Rebel Alliance leader Mon Mothma (Genevieve O'Reilly) has a conversation with Senator Bail Organa in which they discuss delivering the plans for the Death Star to a Jedi Knight who went into hiding after the fall of the Republic; it is implied that they are talking about Obi-Wan. Television Obi-Wan Kenobi is a main character in the animated micro-series Star Wars: Clone Wars and the CGI animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars, voiced by James Arnold Taylor. In both series, Obi-Wan is a general in the Clone Wars, and he and Anakin (voiced by Matt Lanter) have many adventures fighting the Separatists. The latter series highlights his numerous confrontations with General Grievous, his adversarial relationship with Dark Jedi Asajj Ventress (voiced by Nika Futterman), his romance with Duchess Satine Kryze (voiced by Anna Graves), and the return of his old enemy Darth Maul. In Star Wars Rebels, set five years before A New Hope, Obi-Wan appears as a hologram in the pilot episode, \\"Spark of Rebellion\\". In the Season 3 episode \\"Visions and Voices\\", protagonist Ezra Bridger (voiced by Taylor Gray) discovers that Obi-Wan is alive on Tatooine; Obi-Wan's old nemesis Darth Maul finds him as well. In the episode \\"Twin Suns\\", Obi-Wan finds Ezra while he is lost in the desert while letting him know Maul was intending to use him. At that moment, Maul attacks them, and Obi-Wan ushers Ezra to retreat. Obi-Wan mortally wounds Maul during a final lightsaber duel; with his dying breath, Maul asks Obi-Wan if he is protecting the \\"Chosen One\\", and Obi-Wan replies that he is. After Maul's death, Obi-Wan is seen watching over Luke Skywalker from a distance. In Rebels, Obi-Wan was voiced by Stephen Stanton, who replaced James Arnold Taylor. Rebels creator Dave Filoni, who worked with the character during the full duration of Star Wars: The Clone Wars, said he considered asking McGregor to reprise and voice the role. However, a voice recording of the late Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi was used in a 2018 episode. =Upcoming series= Ewan McGregor is set to reprise his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi in an upcoming limited Disney+ series centered around the character, which will be set between the prequel and original trilogies. A film centered on the character was previously in pre- production before being cancelled in favor of the series. Plans for a standalone Star Wars movie about Obi-Wan were rumored (but not officially announced) In August 2017; this was to be directed and co-written by Stephen Daldry. McGregor stated publicly that he would be open to reprising the role of Obi-Wan, though as of mid-2018 said he knew of no plans to do so. In December 2017, it was reported that an Obi-Wan anthology film was eying a potential January 2019 production start date. On May 17, 2018, it was reported that the next Star Wars anthology film would be Kenobi: A Star Wars Story, produced under the working title Joshua Tree, with Daldry directing. According to TMZ, the movie would take place a few years after Revenge of the Sith, featuring marauding Tusken Raiders and an evil warlord, who bring Obi-Wan out of hiding to protect Luke. Then-UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was quoted as saying the filmmakers of an Obi-Wan film had proposed shooting it in Northern Ireland. While the project was voted as the most wanted anthology film in a poll by The Hollywood Reporter, it was instead developed as a limited streaming series following the box office disappointment of Solo: A Star Wars Story. On August 15, 2019, the series was reported to be in development for Disney's streaming service, Disney+. This was officially confirmed on August 23 at the D23 Expo. McGregor expressed his relief at the project's announcement \\"because for four years, I've been having to lie to people about it\\", and stated that the series would consist of six one-hour episodes. According to Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy, the show's scripts had been completed, but these were later confirmed to be rewritten to some degree. It is set eight years after the events of Revenge of the Sith and 11 years before A New Hope. Deborah Chow will direct the series and executive produce alongside Hossein Amini, who wrote the series. Other executive producers include McGregor, Kennedy, and Tracey Seaward. According to Amini, the series was set to begin filming in July 2020, but after stepping down as writer by January of that year, production was pushed back to early 2021. In February 2020, it was reported that the working title had been changed to Pilgrim, and in April, it was announced that Joby Harold would take over writing duties. The series does not have an announced release date. In October 2020, McGregor stated that it was set to begin filming in March 2021. Novels and comics Obi-Wan Kenobi appears briefly in the novel Dark Disciple (2008), based on unfinished episodes from The Clone Wars. In the novelization of The Last Jedi (2017) written by Jason Fry, Obi-Wan tells a dying Luke to \\"let go\\" from the netherworld of the Force. The five-issue Marvel Comics mini-series Obi-Wan and Anakin focuses on the title characters between The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. In the 2015 Star Wars comic series, Luke Skywalker goes to Obi-Wan's abandoned house on Tatooine and finds his diary, from which stories of Obi-Wan's past are recounted.

In April 2014, all prior works except the episodic films and The Clone Wars animated series were rebranded by Lucasfilm as Legends and declared non-canon to the franchise. =Novels= Obi-Wan's life prior to The Phantom Menace is portrayed mostly in Jude Watson's Jedi Apprentice series, which follows his adventures as Qui-Gon's Padawan. Notable events in the series include battling the Dark Jedi Xanatos and going on his first independent mission. Watson's Jedi Quest series detail his adventures with Anakin in the years leading up to Attack of the Clones.

Set roughly a year after the fall of the Republic, the series follows Obi-Wan as he seeks out possible survivors of the Great Jedi Purge, most notably Anakin's former rival, Ferus Olin. The books also portray Obi-Wan adjusting to life as a hermit on Tatooine and quietly watching over Luke. He also discovers that Vader is still alive after seeing him on the Holonet, the galaxy's official news source. Obi-Wan appears in the final chapter of Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader, set just after the events in Revenge of the Sith, in which he learns that Vader survived their duel on Mustafar. Obi-Wan appears in spirit form in many novels set after Return of the Jedi. In The Truce at Bakura, he appears to Luke to warn him about the threat presented by the Ssi-ruuk; in The Lost City of the Jedi, he guides Luke to the titular city on Yavin IV; in Heir to the Empire, meanwhile, he bids farewell to Luke, explaining that he must abandon his spiritual form to \\"move on\\" to a new, higher plane of consciousness. Before parting, Luke says that Obi-Wan was like a father to him, and Obi-Wan replies that he loved Luke like a son. =Video games= Obi-Wan Kenobi appears in several video games, including Super Star Wars where he talks to Luke Skywalker.

Various Dark Horse Comics works utilize Kenobi, including several set during the Clone Wars. In Star Wars: Republic (1998‚Äì2006), Obi-Wan fights the Separatists during the Clone Wars. Among other notable storylines, he is kidnapped and tortured by Asajj Ventress before being rescued by Anakin (\\"Hate & Fear\\"), and apprehends corrupted Jedi Master Quinlan Vos (\\"The Dreadnaughts of Rendili\\"). Throughout the series, he grows increasingly wary of Palpatine's designs on the Republic and his influence on Anakin. In the non-canon story \\"Old Wounds\\", published in Star Wars: Visionaries (2005) and set a few years after the events of Revenge of the Sith, Obi-Wan confronts Darth Maul on Tatooine to protect Luke. The duel ends when Owen Lars shoots and kills Maul; he then warns Obi-Wan to stay away from his nephew. Through the Force, Obi-Wan reassures Luke that he will be there for him when needed. Cultural impact Mad magazine parodied the original film under the title Star Roars and included a character named 'Oldie Von Moldie', a grizzled 97-year-old whose lightsaber runs on an extension cord. The Shanghai nightclub shown in the beginning of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is called \\"Club Obi Wan\\" (Lucas wrote both the Star Wars and Indiana Jones series). A real bar/club by this name existed in the Xihai district of Beijing, China but closed in the summer of 2010. The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! episode \\"Star Koopa\\" (a spoof of Star Wars) also had its own parody of Obi-Wan called 'Obi-Wan Toadi', and the live-action segment \\"Zenned Out Mario\\" featured a parody called \\"Obi-Wan Cannoli\\". The 1998 Animaniacs episode \\"Star Warners\\" (which spoofed Star Wars) featured Slappy Squirrel portraying a parody of Obi-Wan as 'Slappy Wanna Nappy'. In the Family Guy episode \\"Blue Harvest\\", Obi-Wan Kenobi is parodied by the character Herbert. In the short film Thumb Wars, Obi-Wan is parodied as the character \\"Oobedoob Benubi\\". In the film, his full name is 'Oobedoob Scooby-Doobi Benubi, the silliest name in the galaxy.' In the 1977 Star Wars parody Hardware Wars, Obi- Wan is parodied by the character \\"Augie Ben Doggie\\". The TV Tropes website used to use Obi-Wan's name for the archetype mentor figure, and still uses Obi-Wan's name to describe moments where a character faces their imminent death calmly and gracefully, often having intended to die as part of a greater plan. Guinness received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor nomination for his portrayal of Obi-Wan Kenobi. In the parody song \\"The Saga Begins\\", released approximately one month after the release of Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace, \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic sings a humorous summary of the plot of that film from Obi-Wan's perspective, to the tune of the song \\"American Pie\\". In 2003, the American Film Institute selected Obi-Wan Kenobi as the 37th greatest movie hero of all time. He was also listed as IGN's third greatest Star Wars character, as well as one of UGO Networks's favorite heroes of all time. In 2004, the Council of the Commune Lubicz in Poland passed a resolution giving the name \\"Obi-Wan Kenobi\\" to one of the streets in Grabowiec, a small village near Toru≈Ñ. The street was named in 2005. The spelling of the street name, Obi-Wana Kenobiego is the genitive form of the noun in the Polish language: (the street) of Obi-Wan Kenobi. The Guardian cartoonist Steve Bell portrayed Jeremy Corbyn, former leader of the British Labour Party, as Obi-Wan Kenobi.

Originally named Steeplechase Drive, it is located in an industrial park off Atlantic Boulevard, and primarily serves as the address for Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems, an aerospace company. The street ends at a circle where an off-ramp from Virginia State Highway 28 joins from the opposite direction. In 2011, employees of Orbital Sciences‚Äîlater acquired by Northrop‚Äîasked the Loudoun County supervisors to rename their street after the warp drive that allows ships in the Star Trek universe to travel faster than light. The supervisors voted unanimously to make it so (several of them using catchphrases associated with the franchise). Street Warp Drive viewed from Atlantic Boulevard Warp Drive's eastern terminus is a signalized three-way intersection with Atlantic Boulevard, roughly one half-mile (800 m) north of its southern terminus at Church Road (Virginia State Route 625) at Sterling. The area is developed in a pattern typical of eastern Loudoun County's edge-city suburban sprawl. On either side of Atlantic at the intersection are office buildings surrounded by parking lots, all facilities of Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems, with some newer residential subdivisions to the southeast and, across the Cabin Branch of Broad Run, the east. The Washington & Old Dominion Trail runs to the immediate southwest. To the northeast is another office building with an artificial pond. The northwest corner of the intersection, and the entire north side of Warp Drive, is a large undeveloped parcel. From the intersection, the street runs 300 ft (100 m) west, divided by a grass median strip, to a small traffic circle that gives access to driveways into Orbital's facilities on the north and south. On the west side is the end of a one-way offramp that gives access to Warp from Sully Road (Virginia State Route 28), roughly to the west. History Northrop Grumman facility entrance sign using the street name Orbital Sciences Corporation was founded in 1982 to provide rocket engines and parts to aerospace and defense customers public and private. It has always been headquartered in Northern Virginia, like many other defense contractors. In 1993 it moved into its current complex in Sterling. At that time the short street where Orbital was located was known as Steeplechase Drive. In 2011 the company's executives, who were fans of Star Trek, asked the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors to formally rename the street Warp Drive, after the faster-than-light \\"warp drive\\" propulsion technology used by the franchise's starships. At the last meeting of the year, the board voted unanimously to grant the request. Officially, the county said the change was made to \\"improve the identity and to better integrate the Orbital campus.\\" But supervisors were less formal when discussing the issue, which had originally been on a consent agenda. Several cast their votes with catchphrases from the original Star Trek series. \\"To Orbital, live long and prosper,\\" said Steven Miller, who lived in Sterling. \\"Can you give me any speed, Scotty?\\", incorrectly using a Scottish accent as he did so. One supervisor, Jim Burton of Blue Ridge, tried to be serious. He reminded the board that \\"warp\\" had other meanings. \\"You need to think about it before you vote on it\\" he warned. \\"Would you prefer 'Beam me up, Scotty?'\\", the board's chairman replied. In the end the vote was unanimous. \\"What more uplifting motion could there possibly be than something that will literally make law out of a Star Trek joke?\\" concluded Miller. \\"It's a great idea. I look forward to driving on Warp Drive myself.\\" Orbital agreed to reimburse the county for the approximately $500 it would cost to replace the street sign. The online Ashburn Patch noted how the name change reflected the changes to Loudoun County in the past two decades. While the western portion of the county has stayed largely rural and agricultural, as evoked by the street's original name of Steeplechase Drive, eastern Loudoun has grown tremendously during that same time as many businesses, in particular high-tech defense contractors like Orbital, have located in the area. \\"So Orbital's request to change the name of the road along its perimeter from Steeplechase Drive to Warp Drive brings to mind the county's dichotomy,\\" it observed. \\"Out with the horse-racing theme and in with space.\\" On September 18, 2017, Northrop Grumman announced plans to purchase Orbital for $7.8 billion in cash plus assumption of $1.4 billion in debt.

Radford, B. \\"Crop Circles Explained\\". LiveScience. The number of crop circles has substantially increased from the 1970s to current times. There has been scant scientific study of them. Circles in the United Kingdom are not distributed randomly across the landscape but appear near roads, areas of medium to dense population and cultural heritage monuments, such as Stonehenge or Avebury. In 1991, two hoaxers, Bower and Chorley, took credit for having created many circles throughout England after one of their circles was described by a circle investigator as impossible to be made by human hand. Formations are usually created overnight, although some are reported to have appeared during the day. In contrast to crop circles or crop formations, archaeological remains can cause cropmarks in the fields in the shapes of circles and squares, but they do not appear overnight, and they are always in the same places every year. Nearly half of all crop circles found in the UK in 2003 were located within a 15 km radius of the Avebury stone circles.  History  The concept of \\"crop circles\\" began with the original late-1970s hoaxes by Doug Bower and Dave Chorley (see Bower and Chorley, below). They said that they were inspired by the Tully \\"saucer nest\\" case in Australia, where a farmer claimed to first have seen a UFO, then found a flattened circle of swamp reeds.  Before the 20th century  A 1678 news pamphlet The Mowing- Devil: or, Strange News Out of Hartfordshire is claimed by some crop circle devotees to be the first depiction of a crop circle. Crop circle researcher Jim Schnabel does not consider it to be a historical precedent because it describes the stalks as being cut rather than bent (see folklore section). In 1686, British naturalist Robert Plot reported on rings or arcs of mushrooms (see fairy rings) in The Natural History of Stafford-Shire and proposed air flows from the sky as a cause. at Project Gutenberg In 1991 meteorologist Terence Meaden linked this report with modern crop circles, a claim that has been compared with those made by Erich von D√§niken. An 1880 letter to the editor of Nature by amateur scientist John Rand Capron describes how a recent storm had created several circles of flattened crops in a field.  20th century  In 1932, archaeologist E. C. Curwen observed four dark rings in a field at Stoughton Down near Chichester, but could examine only one: \\"a circle in which the barley was 'lodged' or beaten down, while the interior area was very slightly mounded up.\\"Sussex Notes and Queries, 1937 Eliot Cecil Curwen pp. 139‚Äì40 In 1963, amateur astronomer Patrick Moore described a crater in a potato field in Wiltshire, which he considered was probably caused by an unknown meteoric body. In nearby wheat fields, there were several circular and elliptical areas where the wheat had been flattened. There was evidence of \\"spiral flattening\\". He thought they could be caused by air currents from the impact, since they led towards the crater.Moore P. ‚ÄòThat Wiltshire Crater‚Äô Letter to the editor New Scientist 8 August 1963 Astronomer Hugh Ernest Butler observed similar craters and said they were likely caused by lightning strikes.Hugh Ernest Butler 'That Wiltshire Crater', New Scientist issue 352, 15 August 1963 Letters to the editor In the 1960s, in Tully, Queensland, Australia, and in Canada, there were many reports of UFO sightings and circular formations in swamp reeds and sugar cane fields. For example, on 8 August 1967, three circles were found in a field in Duhamel, Alberta, Canada; Department of National Defence investigators concluded that it was artificial but couldn't say who made them or how. At Library and Archives Canada. (Original in French). The most famous case is the 1966 Tully \\"saucer nest\\", when a farmer said he witnessed a saucer-shaped craft rise 30 or from a swamp and then fly away. On investigating he found a nearly circular area 32 feet long by 25 feet wide where the grass was flattened in clockwise curves to water level within the circle, and the reeds had been uprooted from the mud. The local police officer, the Royal Australian Air Force, and the University of Queensland concluded that it was most probably caused by natural causes, like a down draught, a willy-willy (dust devil), or a waterspout. In 1973, G.J. Odgers, Director of Public Relations, Department of Defence (Air Office), wrote to a journalist that the \\"saucer\\" was probably debris lifted by the causing willy-willy. Hoaxers Bower and Chorley said they were inspired by this case to start making the modern crop circles that appear today. (registration required) The first film to depict a geometric crop circle, in this case created by super-intelligent ants, is Phase IV in 1974. The film has been cited as a possible inspiration or influence on the pranksters who started this phenomenon.Pilkington, Mark (2010) \\"History, the Hive Mind, and Agrarian Art\\". In The Anomalist, Vol. 14. http://www.thewire.co.uk/articles/4106/ Since the 1960s, there had been a surge of UFOlogists in Wiltshire, and there were rumours of \\"saucer nests\\" appearing in the area, but they were never photographed. There are other pre-1970s reports of circular formations, especially in Australia and Canada, but they were always simple circles, which could have been caused by whirlwinds. In Fortean Times David Wood reported that in 1940 he had already made crop circles near Gloucestershire using ropes. citing: In 1997, the Oxford English Dictionary recorded the earliest usage of the term \\"crop circles\\" in a 1988 issue of Journal of Meteorology, referring to a BBC film.Oxford English Dictionary, \\"Crop: Draft additions 1997\\", in Jrnl. Meteorol. 13 290. The coining of the term \\"crop circle\\" is attributed to Colin Andrews in the late 1970s or early 1980s. The majority of reports of crop circles have appeared in and spread since the late 1970s as many circles began appearing throughout the English countryside. This phenomenon became widely known in the late 1980s, after the media started to report crop circles in Hampshire and Wiltshire. After Bower's and Chorley's 1991 statement that they were responsible for many of them, circles started appearing all over the world. To date, approximately 10,000 crop circles have been reported internationally, from locations such as the former Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, the U.S., and Canada. Sceptics note a correlation between crop circles, recent media coverage, and the absence of fencing and/or anti-trespassing legislation. Although farmers expressed concern at the damage caused to their crops, local response to the appearance of crop circles was often enthusiastic, with locals taking advantage of the increase of tourism and visits from scientists, crop circle researchers, and individuals seeking spiritual experiences. The market for crop-circle interest consequently generated bus or helicopter tours of circle sites, walking tours, T-shirts, and book sales.  21st century  Since the start of the 21st century, crop formations have increased in size and complexity, with some featuring as many as 2,000 different shapes and some incorporating complex mathematical and scientific characteristics. The researcher Jeremy Northcote found that crop circles in the UK in 2002 were not spread randomly across the landscape. They tended to appear near roads, areas of medium-to-dense population, and cultural heritage monuments such as Stonehenge or Avebury. He found that they always appeared in areas that were easy to access. This suggests strongly that these crop circles were more likely to be caused by intentional human action than by paranormal activity. Another strong indication of that theory was that inhabitants of the zone with the most circles had a historical tendency for making large-scale formations, including stone circles such as Stonehenge, burial mounds such as Silbury Hill, long barrows such as West Kennet Long Barrow, and white horses in chalk hills.  Bower and Chorley  In 1991, self-professed pranksters Doug Bower and Dave Chorley made headlines claiming it was they who started the phenomenon in 1978 with the use of simple tools consisting of a plank of wood, rope, and a baseball cap fitted with a loop of wire to help them walk in a straight line. To prove their case they made a circle in front of journalists; a \\"cereologist\\" (advocate of paranormal explanations of crop circles), Pat Delgado, examined the circle and declared it authentic before it was revealed that it was a hoax. Inspired by Australian crop circle accounts from 1966, Bower and Chorley claimed to be responsible for all circles made prior to 1987, and for more than 200 crop circles in 1978‚Äì1991 (with 1,000 other circles not being made by them). According to Professor Richard Taylor, \\"the pictographs they created inspired a second wave of crop artists. Far from fizzling out, crop circles have evolved into an international phenomenon, with hundreds of sophisticated pictographs now appearing annually around the globe.\\" Smithsonian magazine wrote: :Since Bower and Chorley‚Äôs circles appeared, the geometric designs have escalated in scale and complexity, as each year teams of anonymous circle-makers lay honey traps for New Age tourists.  Art and business  Since the early 1990s, the UK arts collective Circlemakers, founded by artists Rod Dickinson and John Lundberg (and subsequently including artists Wil Russell and Rob Irving), have been creating crop circles in the UK and around the world as part of their art practice and for commercial clients. The Led Zeppelin Boxed Set that was released on 7 September 1990, along with the remasters of the first boxed set, as well as the second boxed set, all feature an image of a crop circle that appeared in East Field in Alton Barnes, Wiltshire. Aerial view of a crop circle in Diessenhofen On the night of 11‚Äì12 July 1992, a crop-circle making competition with a prize of ¬£3,000 (funded in part by the Arthur Koestler Foundation) was held in Berkshire. The winning entry was produced by three Westland Helicopters engineers, using rope, PVC pipe, a plank, string, a telescopic device and two stepladders. According to Rupert Sheldrake, the competition was organised by him and John Michell and \\"co-sponsored by The Guardian and The Cerealogist\\". The prize money came from PM, a German magazine. Sheldrake wrote that \\"The experiment was conclusive. Humans could indeed make all the features of state-of-the-art crop formations at that time. Eleven of the twelve teams made more or less impressive formations that followed the set design.\\" In 2002, Discovery Channel commissioned five aeronautics and astronautics graduate students from MIT to create crop circles of their own, aiming to duplicate some of the features claimed to distinguish \\"real\\" crop circles from the known fakes such as those created by Bower and Chorley. The creation of the circle was recorded and used in the Discovery Channel documentary Crop Circles: Mysteries in the Fields. In 2009, The Guardian reported that crop circle activity had been waning around Wiltshire, in part because makers preferred creating promotional crop circles for companies that paid well for their efforts. A video sequence used in connection with the opening of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London showed two crop circles in the shape of the Olympic rings. Another Olympic crop circle was visible to passengers landing at nearby Heathrow Airport before and during the Games. A crop circle depicting the emblem of the Star Wars Rebel Alliance was created in California in December 2017 by a father and his 11-year-old son as a spaceport for X-wing fighters.  Legal implications  In 1992, Hungarian youths G√°bor Tak√°cs and R√≥bert Dallos, both then 17, were the first people to face legal action after creating a crop circle. Tak√°cs and Dallos, of the St. Stephen Agricultural Technicum, a high school in Hungary specializing in agriculture, created a diameter crop circle in a wheat field near Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, southwest of Budapest, on June 8, 1992. On September 3, the pair appeared on Hungarian TV and exposed the circle as a hoax, showing photos of the field before and after the circle was made. As a result, Aranykal√°sz Co., the owners of the land, sued the teens for 630,000 Ft (~$3,000 USD) in damages. The presiding judge ruled that the students were only responsible for the damage caused in the circle itself, amounting to about 6,000 Ft (~$30 USD), and that 99% of the damage to the crops was caused by the thousands of visitors who flocked to Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r following the media's promotion of the circle. The fine was eventually paid by the TV show, as were the students' legal fees. In 2000, Matthew Williams became the first man in the UK to be arrested for causing criminal damage after making a crop circle near Devizes. In November 2000, he was fined ¬£100 and ¬£40 in costs. , no one else has been successfully prosecuted in the UK for criminal damage caused by creating crop circles.  Creation  Detail of a crop circle in a field in Switzerland The scientific consensus on crop circles is that they are constructed by human beings as hoaxes, advertising, or art. The most widely known method for a person or group to construct a crop formation is to tie one end of a rope to an anchor point and the other end to a board which is used to crush the plants. Skeptics of the paranormal point out that all characteristics of crop circles are fully compatible with their being made by hoaxers. Bower and Chorley confessed in 1991 to making the first crop circles in southern England. When some people refused to believe them, they deliberately added straight lines and squares to show that they could not have natural causes. In a copycat effect, increasingly complex circles started appearing in many countries around the world, including fractal figures. Physicists have suggested that the most complex formations might be made with the help of GPS and lasers. In 2009, a circle formation was made over the course of three consecutive nights and was apparently left unfinished, with some half-made circles. The main criticism of alleged non-human creation of crop circles is that while evidence of these origins, besides eyewitness testimonies, is essentially absent, some are definitely known to be the work of human pranksters, and others can be adequately explained as such. There have been cases in which researchers declared crop circles to be \\"the real thing\\", only to be confronted with the people who created the circle and documented the fraud, Cited as reference 6 in like Bower and Chorley and tabloid Today hoaxing Pat Delgado, the Wessex Sceptics and Channel 4's Equinox hoaxing Terence Meaden, or a friend of a Canadian farmer hoaxing a field researcher of the Canadian Crop Circle Research Network. In his 1997 book The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, Carl Sagan concludes that crop circles were created by Bower and Chorley and their copycats, and speculates that UFOlogists willingly ignore the evidence for hoaxing so they can keep believing in an extraterrestrial origin of the circles. Many others have demonstrated how complex crop circles can be created. Scientific American published an article by Matt Ridley, who started making crop circles in northern England in 1991. He wrote about how easy it is to develop techniques using simple tools that can easily fool later observers. He reported on \\"expert\\" sources such as The Wall Street Journal, who had been easily fooled and mused about why people want to believe supernatural explanations for phenomena that are not yet explained. Methods of creating a crop circle are now well documented on the Internet. Some crop formations are paid for by companies who use them as advertising. Many crop circles show human symbols, like the heart and arrow symbol of love, and stereotyped alien faces. Hoaxers have been caught in the process of making new circles, such as in 2004 in the Netherlands for example (see more cases in \\"legal implications\\" section above). Advocates of non-human causes discount on-site evidence of human involvement as attempts to discredit the phenomena. Some even argue a conspiracy theory, with governments planting evidence of hoaxing to muddle the origins of the circles. When Ridley wrote negative articles in newspapers, he was accused of spreading \\"government disinformation\\" and of working for the UK military intelligence service MI5. Ridley responded by noting that many cereologists make good livings from selling books and providing high-priced personal tours through crop fields, and he claimed that they have vested interests in rejecting what is by far the most likely explanation for the circles. In serious science magazines from the 1980s and 1990s, for example Science Illustrated, one could read reports on that the plants were bent by something that could be microwave radiation, rather than broken as they would become by physical impact. The magazines also contained serious reports of the absence of human influence and measurement of unusual radiation. Today, this is considered to be pseudoscience, while at the time it was subject of serious research. At that time, it was also more likely that an unknown factor was behind the incidents, not least seen in light of the fact that GPS was not available to the public.https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2016-07-26/scientific-crop-circle- research-held-back-by-ufo-links/7660712  Alternative explanations   Weather  It has been suggested that crop circles may be the result of extraordinary meteorological phenomena ranging from freak tornadoes to ball lightning, but there is no evidence of any crop circle being created by any of these causes. In 1880, an amateur scientist, John Rand Capron, wrote a letter to the editor of journal Nature about some circles in crops and blamed them on a recent storm, saying their shape was \\"suggestive of some cyclonic wind action\\". In 1980, Terence Meaden, a meteorologist and physicist, proposed that the circles were caused by whirlwinds whose course was affected by southern England hills. As circles became more complex, Terence had to create increasingly complex theories, blaming an electromagneto-hydrodynamic \\"plasma vortex\\". The meteorological theory became popular, and it was even referenced in 1991 by physicist Stephen Hawking who said that, \\"Corn circles are either hoaxes or formed by vortex movement of air\\". The weather theory suffered a serious blow in 1991, but Hawking's point about hoaxes was supported when Bower and Chorley stated that they had been responsible for making all those circles. By the end of 1991 Meaden conceded that those circles that had complex designs were made by hoaxers. Cited in  Paranormal  Ministry of Defence circa 1998. Since becoming the focus of widespread media attention in the 1980s, crop circles have become the subject of speculation by various paranormal, ufological, and anomalistic investigators ranging from proposals that they were created by bizarre meteorological phenomena to messages from extraterrestrial beings. There has also been speculation that crop circles have a relation to ley lines. Many New Age groups incorporate crop circles into their belief systems. Some paranormal advocates think that crop circles are caused by ball lighting and that the patterns are so complex that they have to be controlled by some entity. Some proposed entities are: Gaia asking to stop global warming and human pollution, God, supernatural beings (for example Indian devas), the collective minds of humanity through a proposed \\"quantum field\\", or extraterrestrial beings. Responding to local beliefs that \\"extraterrestrial beings\\" in UFOs were responsible for crop circles appearing, the Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) described crop circles as \\"man-made\\". Thomas Djamaluddin, research professor of astronomy and astrophysics at LAPAN stated, \\"We have come to agree that this 'thing' cannot be scientifically proven.\\" Among others, paranormal enthusiasts, ufologists, and anomalistic investigators have offered hypothetical explanations that have been criticized as pseudoscientific by sceptical groups and scientists, including the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. No credible evidence of extraterrestrial origin has been presented.  Animal activity  In 2009, the attorney general for the island state of Tasmania stated that Australian wallabies had been found creating crop circles in fields of opium poppies, which are grown legally for medicinal use, after consuming some of the opiate-laden poppies and running in circles.  Changes to crops  A small number of scientists (physicist Eltjo Haselhoff, the late biophysicist William Levengood) have found differences between the crops inside the circles and outside them, citing this as evidence they were not man-made. Levengood published papers in journal Physiologia Plantarum in 1994 and 1999. In his 1994 paper he found that certain deformities in the grain inside the circles were correlated to the position of the grain inside the circle. In 1996 sceptic Joe Nickell objected that correlation is not causation, raised several objections to Levengood's methods and assumptions, and said \\"Until his work is independently replicated by qualified scientists doing 'double-blind' studies and otherwise following stringent scientific protocols, there seems no need to take seriously the many dubious claims that Levengood makes, including his similar ones involving plants at alleged 'cattle mutilation' sites.\\" (in reference to cattle mutilation).  Magnetism  In 2000, Colin Andrews, who had researched crop circles for 17 years, stated that while he believed 80% were man-made, he thought the remaining circles, with less elaborate designs, could be explained by a three-degree shift in the Earth's magnetic field, that creates a current that \\"electrocutes\\" the crops, causing them to flatten and form the circle.  Folklore  Researchers of crop circles have linked modern crop circles to old folkloric tales to support the claim that they are not artificially produced. Circle crops are culture-dependent: they appear mostly in developed and secularized Western countries where people are receptive to New Age beliefs, including Japan, but they don't appear at all in other zones, such as Muslim countries. Fungi can cause circular areas of crop to die, probably the origin of tales of \\"fairie rings\\". Tales also mention balls of light many times but never in relation to crop circles. 1678 pamphlet on the \\"Mowing-Devil\\". A 17th-century English woodcut called the Mowing-Devil depicts the devil with a scythe mowing (cutting) a circular design in a field of oats. The pamphlet containing the image states that the farmer, disgusted at the wage his mower was demanding for his work, insisted that he would rather have \\"the devil himself\\" perform the task. Crop circle researcher Jim Schnabel does not consider this to be a historical precedent for crop circles because the stalks were cut down, not bent. The circular form indicated to the farmer that it had been caused by the devil. In the 1948 German story Die zw√∂lf Schw√§ne (The Twelve Swans), a farmer every morning found a circular ring of flattened grain on his field. After several attempts, his son saw twelve princesses disguised as swans, who took off their disguises and danced in the field. Crop rings produced by fungi may have inspired such tales since folklore holds these rings are created by dancing wolves or fairies.

It was one of the first terminals to support ANSI escape codes for cursor control and other tasks, and added a number of extended codes for special features like controlling the status lights on the keyboard. This led to rapid uptake of the ANSI standard, becoming the de facto standard for terminal emulators. The VT100s, especially the VT102, was extremely successful in the market, and made DEC the leading terminal vendor at the time. The VT100 series was replaced by the VT200 series starting in 1983, which proved just as successful. Ultimately, over six million terminals in the VT series were sold, based largely on the success of the VT100s.\\"VT 510/520 Video Display Terminal\\", Boundless Technologies. Description DEC's first successful video terminal was the VT50, introduced in 1974 and quickly replaced by the VT52 in 1975. The VT52 featured a text display with 80 columns and 24 rows, bidirectional scrolling, and a custom control language that allowed the cursor to be moved about the screen. These \\"smart terminals\\" were a hit due both to their capabilities and to their ability to be run over inexpensive serial links, rather than custom connection as in the case of systems like the IBM 3270, which generally required expensive controllers for distributed applications. The VT100 was introduced in August 1978, replacing the VT50/VT52 family. Like the earlier models, it communicated with its host system over serial lines at a minimum speed of 50 bit/s, but increased the maximum speed to 19,200 bit/s, double that of the VT52. Other improvements on the VT52 included a 132 column mode, and a variety of \\"graphic renditions\\" including blinking, bolding, reverse video, and underlining. The VT100 also introduced an additional box-drawing character set containing various pseudographics that allowed the drawing of on-screen forms. All setup of the VT100 was accomplished using interactive displays presented on the screen; the setup data was stored in non-volatile memory within the terminal. Maintainability was also significantly improved since a VT100 could be dismantled quickly without tools. The major change within the system was the control system. Unlike the VT50/52's proprietary cursor control language, the VT100 was based on the emerging ANSI X3.64 standard for command codes. At the time, computer vendors suggested that the standard was beyond the state of the art and could not be implemented at a reasonable price. The introduction of low-cost microprocessors and the ever-falling cost of computer memory addressed these problems, and the VT100 used the new Intel 8080 as its internal processor. In addition, the VT100 provided backwards compatibility for VT52 users, with support for the VT52 control sequences.http://ascii-table.com/ansi-escape- sequences-vt-100.php In 1983, the VT100 was replaced by the more powerful VT200 series terminals such as the VT220. Variants VT101 VT131 on display at the Living Computer Museum The VT100 was the first of Digital's terminals to be based on an industry-standard microprocessor, the Intel 8080. Options could be added to the terminal to support an external printer, additional graphic renditions, and more memory. The later option, known as Advanced Video Option or AVO, allowed the terminal to support a full 24 lines of text in 132 column mode. The VT100 became a platform on which Digital constructed related products. The VT101 and VT102 were cost-reduced, non-expandable follow-on versions. The VT101 was essentially a base-model VT100, while the VT102 came standard with the AVO and serial printer port options pre-installed. The VT105 contained a simple graphics subsystem known as waveform graphics which was mostly compatible with same system in the earlier VT55. This system allowed two mathematical functions to be drawn to the screen on top of the normal text display, allowing text and graphics to be mixed to produce charts and similar output.VT55 Programmer's Manual, DEC, 1977 The VT125 added an implementation of the byte-efficient Remote Graphic Instruction Set, ReGIS, which used custom ANSI codes to send the graphics commands to the terminal, rather than requiring the terminal to be set to a separate graphics mode like the VT105. The VT100 form factor left significant room in the case for expansion, and DEC used this to produce several all-in-one stand-alone minicomputer systems. The VT103 included a cardcage and 4√ó4 (8-slot) Q-Bus backplane, sufficient to configure a small LSI-11 system within the case,VT103 LSI-11 Video Terminal User's Guide (Digital Equipment Corporation, 1979) and supported an optional dual TU58 DECtape II block addressable cartridge tape drive which behaves like a very slow disk drive. The VT180 (codenamed \\"Robin\\") added a single-board microcomputer using a Zilog Z80 to run CP/M. The VT278 (DECmate) added a PDP-8 processor, allowing the terminal to run Digital's WPS-8 word processing software.

It is about in diameter, some deep, and is surrounded by a rim that rises above the surrounding plains. The center of the crater is filled with of rubble lying above crater bedrock. One of the interesting features of the crater is its squared-off outline, believed to be caused by existing regional jointing (cracks) in the strata at the impact site. The crater is privately owned by the Barringer family through their Barringer Crater Company, which proclaims it to be the \\"best preserved meteorite crater on Earth\\". Since the crater is privately owned, it is not protected as a national monument, a status that would require federal ownership. It was designated a National Natural Landmark in November 1967. Formation The crater was created about 50,000 years ago during the Pleistocene epoch, when the local climate on the Colorado Plateau was much cooler and damper. The area was an open grassland dotted with woodlands inhabited by mammoths and giant ground sloths. The object that excavated the crater was a nickel-iron meteorite about across. The speed of the impact has been a subject of some debate. Modeling initially suggested that the meteorite struck at up to but more recent research suggests the impact was substantially slower, at . It is believed that about half of the impactor's bulk was vaporized during its descent through the atmosphere. Impact energy has been estimated at about 10 megatons TNTe. The meteorite was mostly vaporized upon impact, leaving few remains in the crater.Schaber, Gerald G. \\"The U.S. Geological Survey, Branch of Astrogeology‚ÄîA Chronology of Activities from Conception through the End of Project Apollo (1960‚Äì1973)\\", 2005, U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 2005-1190. (PDF) Since the crater's formation, the rim is thought to have lost of height at the rim crest as a result of natural erosion. Similarly, the basin of the crater is thought to have approximately of additional post-impact sedimentation from lake sediments and of alluvium. These erosion processes are the reason that very few remaining craters are visible on Earth, since many have been erased by these geological processes. The relatively young age of Meteor Crater, paired with the dry Arizona climate, have allowed this crater to remain almost unchanged since its formation. The lack of erosion that preserved the crater's shape helped lead to this crater being the first crater recognized as an impact crater from a natural celestial body. Discovery and investigation The crater came to the attention of scientists after American settlers discovered it in the 19th century. They named it the Canyon Diablo crater after Canyon Diablo, Arizona, which was the closest community to the crater in the late 19th century. The crater had initially been ascribed to the actions of a volcano. That was not an unreasonable assumption, as the San Francisco volcanic field lies only about to the west. Aerial view of Arizona Meteor Crater, September 2010 Looking into the crater from the north rim. The rust colored area on the far (south) rim is where the last mining for the meteorite occurred in 1929 and was believed to be the site of the bulk of the meteorite. Rock around the south rim is uplifted. Albert E. Foote In 1891, the mineralogist Albert E. Foote presented the first scientific paper about the meteorites of Northern Arizona. Several years earlier, Foote had received an iron rock for analysis from a railroad executive. Foote immediately recognized the rock as a meteorite and led an expedition to search and retrieve additional meteorite samples. The team collected samples ranging from small fragments to over . Foote identified several minerals in the meteorites, including diamond, albeit of little commercial value. His paper to the Association for the Advancement of Science provided the first geological description of the crater to a scientific community. Grove Karl Gilbert In November 1891, Grove Karl Gilbert, chief geologist for the U.S. Geological Survey, investigated the crater and concluded that it was the result of a volcanic steam explosion. Gilbert had assumed that if it were an impact crater then the volume of the crater, as well as meteoritic material, should be extant in the rim. Gilbert also assumed a large portion of the meteorite should be buried in the crater and that this would generate a large magnetic anomaly. Gilbert's calculations showed that the volume of the crater and the debris on the rim were roughly equivalent, so that the mass of the hypothetical impactor was missing, nor were there any magnetic anomalies; he argued that the meteorite fragments found on the rim were coincidental. Gilbert publicized his conclusions in a series of lectures. In 1892, however, Gilbert would be among the first to propose that the Moon's craters were caused by impact rather than volcanism. Daniel M. Barringer In 1903, mining engineer and businessman Daniel M. Barringer suggested that the crater had been produced by the impact of a large iron-metallic meteorite. Barringer's company, the Standard Iron Company, staked a mining claim to the land and received a land patent signed by Theodore Roosevelt for 640 acres (one square mile, or ) around the center of the crater in 1903. The claim was divided into four quadrants coming from the center clockwise from north-west named Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. In 1906, Roosevelt authorized the establishment of a newly named Meteor, Arizona, post office (the closest post office before was away in Winslow, Arizona). This new post office was located at Sunshine, a stop on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway six miles north of the crater. Standard Iron Company conducted research on the crater's origins between 1903 and 1905. It concluded that the crater had indeed been caused by an impact. Barringer and his partner, the mathematician and physicist Benjamin Chew Tilghman, documented evidence for the impact theory in papers presented to the U.S. Geological Survey in 1906 and published in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia.Barringer, D.M. (1906). \\"Coon Mountain and its Crater.\\" Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Science of Philadelphia, 57:861‚Äì86. PDF Fragment of the Ca√±on Diablo Meteorite Barringer's arguments were met with skepticism, as there was a reluctance at the time to consider the role of meteorites in terrestrial geology. He persisted and sought to bolster his theory by locating the remains of the meteorite. At the time of discovery, the surrounding plains were covered with about 30 tons of large oxidized iron meteorite fragments. This led Barringer to believe that the bulk of the impactor could still be found under the crater floor. Impact physics was poorly understood at the time and Barringer was unaware that most of the meteorite vaporized on impact. He spent 27 years trying to locate a large deposit of meteoric iron, and drilled to a depth of but no significant deposit was ever found. Barringer, who in 1894 was one of the investors who made US$15 million in the Commonwealth silver mine in Pearce, Cochise County, Arizona, had ambitious plans for the iron ore.Southgate, Nancy; Barringer, Felicity (2002). A Grand Obsession: Daniel Moreau and His Crater. Barringer Crater Co. He estimated from the size of the crater that the meteorite had a mass of 100 million tons. The current estimate of 300,000 tons for the impactor is less than 1/300th (0.3 percent) of Barringer's estimate. Iron ore of the type found at the crater was valued at the time at US$125/ton, so Barringer was searching for a lode he believed to be worth more than a billion 1903 dollars. Despite Barringer's findings and other excavations in the early 20th century, geologists' skepticism continued until the 1950s when planetary science gained in maturity and understanding of cratering processes increased. Professor Herman Leroy Fairchild, an early promoter of impact cratering, argued Barringer's case in an article in Science in 1930.  Harvey H. Nininger  Harvey Harlow Nininger was an American meteoriticist and educator, and although he was self-taught, he revived interest in scientific study of meteorites in the 1930s and assembled the largest personal collection of meteorites up to that time. While based in Denver, Colorado, Nininger published the first edition of a pamphlet titled A Comet Strikes the Earth, which described how Meteor Crater formed when an asteroid impacted the Earth. In 1942, Harvey Nininger moved his home and business from Denver, Colorado, to the Meteor Crater Observatory, located near the turn-off for Meteor Crater on Route 66. He re-named the building the \\"American Meteorite Museum\\" and published a number of meteorite and Meteor Crater-related books from the location. He also conducted a wide range of research at the crater, discovering impactite, iron-nickel spherules related to the impact and vaporization of the asteroid, and the presence of many features still unique to the crater, such as half-melted slugs of meteoric iron mixed with melted target rock. Nininger's discoveries were compiled and published in a seminal work, Arizona's Meteorite Crater (1956). Eugene M. Shoemaker Meteor Crater Later research by Eugene Merle Shoemaker confirmed Barringer's and Nininger's hypothesis. A key discovery was the presence in the crater of the minerals coesite and stishovite, rare forms of silica found only where quartz-bearing rocks have been severely shocked by an instantaneous overpressure. It cannot be created by volcanic action; the only known mechanisms of creating it are naturally through an impact event, or artificially through a nuclear explosion.Shoemaker, Eugene M. (1987). \\"Meteor Crater, Arizona\\", Geological Society of America Centennial Field Guide ‚Äì Rocky Mountain Section. In 1960, Edward C. T. Chao and Shoemaker identified coesite at Meteor Crater, adding to the growing body of evidence that the crater was formed from an impact generating extremely high temperatures and pressures. The impact would have vaporized much of the main body of iron mass, while the pieces of Canyon Diablo meteorite found scattered around the site, had broken away from the main body before impact. Geologists used the nuclear detonation that created the Sedan crater, and other such craters from the era of atmospheric nuclear testing, to establish upper and lower limits on the potential energy of the meteor impactor. Geology The impact created an inverted stratigraphy, so that the layers immediately exterior to the rim are stacked in the reverse order to which they normally occur; the impact overturned and inverted the layers to a distance of one to two kilometers outward from the crater's edge. Specifically, climbing the rim of the crater from outside, one finds: * Coconino Sandstone (sandstone formed 265 million years ago) nearest the top of the rim * Toroweap Formation (limestone formed 255 million years ago) * Kaibab Formation (dolostone formed 250 million years ago) * Moenkopi Formation (mudstone formed 245 million years ago) nearest the outer foot of the rim Soils around the crater are brown, slightly to moderately alkaline gravelly or stony loam of the Winona series; on the crater rim and in the crater itself the Winona is mapped in a complex association with Rock Outcrop.https://websoilsurvey.sc.egov.usda.gov/App/WebSoilSurvey.aspx Recent history full size image Meteor Crater, 2010 During the 1960s and 1970s, NASA astronauts trained in the crater to prepare for the Apollo missions to the Moon. On August 8, 1964, a pair of commercial pilots in a Cessna 150 flew low over the crater. After crossing the rim, they could not maintain level flight. The pilot attempted to circle in the crater to climb over the rim. During the attempted climb out, the aircraft stalled, crashed and caught fire. It is commonly reported that the plane ran out of fuel, but this is incorrect. Both occupants were severely injured but survived their ordeal. A small portion of the wreckage not removed from the crash site remains visible.Plane Crash At Meteor Crater Revisited, September 1, 2008 Meteorite-times.com In 2006, a project called METCRAX (for METeor CRAter eXperiment) investigated \\"the diurnal buildup and breakdown of basin temperature inversions or cold air pools and the associated physical and dynamical processes accounting for their evolving structure and morphology.\\" Meteor Crater is a popular tourist attraction privately owned by the Barringer family through the Barringer Crater Company, with an admission fee charged to see the crater. The Meteor Crater Visitor Center on the north rim features interactive exhibits and displays about meteorites and asteroids, space, the Solar System, and comets. It features the American Astronaut Wall of Fame and such artifacts on display as an Apollo boilerplate command module (BP-29), a meteorite found in the area, and meteorite specimens from Meteor Crater that can be touched. Formerly known as the Museum of Astrogeology, the Visitor Center includes a movie theater, a gift shop, and observation areas with views inside the rim of the crater. Guided tours of the rim are offered daily, weather permitting.

Linen is very strong and absorbent, and dries faster than cotton. Because of these properties, linen is comfortable to wear in hot weather and is valued for use in garments. It also has other distinctive characteristics, notably its tendency to wrinkle. Many other products, including home furnishing items, are also often made from linen. Linen textiles appear to be some of the oldest in the world; their history goes back many thousands of years. Dyed flax fibers found in a cave in Southeastern Europe (present-day Georgia) suggest the use of woven linen fabrics from wild flax may date back over 30,000 years. Linen was used in ancient civilizations including Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt, and linen is mentioned in the Bible. In the 18th century and beyond, the linen industry was important in the economies of several countries in Europe as well as the American colonies. Textiles in a linen weave texture, even when made of cotton, hemp, or other non-flax fibers, are also loosely referred to as \\"linen.\\" Etymology The word linen is of West Germanic origin and cognate to the Latin name for the flax plant, linum, and the earlier Greek ŒªŒπŒΩœåŒΩ (lin√≥n). This word history has given rise to a number of other terms in English, most notably line, from the use of a linen (flax) thread to determine a straight line. It is also etymologically related to a number of other terms, including lining, because linen was often used to create an inner layer for clothing, and lingerie, from French, which originally denoted underwear made of linen.  History  A bag of white linen, unopened. Contains rolls of linen. Foundation deposit, Heb Sed Chapel at Lahun, Fayum, Egypt. 12th Dynasty. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London. People in various parts of the world began weaving linen at least several thousand years ago.  Early history  The discovery of dyed flax fibers in a cave in Southeastern Europe (present-day Georgia) dated to 36,000 years ago suggests that ancient people used wild flax fibers to create linen-like fabrics from an early date. Fragments of straw, seeds, fibers, yarns, and various types of fabrics, including linen samples, dating to about 8,000 BC have been found in Swiss lake dwellings. Woven flax textile fragments have been \\"found between infant and child\\" in a burial at √áatalh√∂y√ºk, a large settlement dating to around 7,000 BC. To the southwest, in ancient Mesopotamia, flax was domesticated and linen was produced. It was used mainly by the wealthier class of the society, including priests. The Sumerian poem of the courtship of Inanna mentions flax and linen. In ancient Egypt, linen was used for mummification and for burial shrouds. It was also worn as clothing on a daily basis; white linen was worn because of the extreme heat. For example, the Tarkhan dress, considered to be among the oldest woven garments in the world and dated to between 3482 and 3102 BC, is made of linen. Plutarch wrote that the priests of Isis also wore linen because of its purity. Linen was sometimes used as a form of currency in ancient Egypt. Egyptian mummies were wrapped in linen as a symbol of light and purity, and as a display of wealth. Some of these fabrics, woven from hand-spun yarns, were very fine for their day, but are coarse compared to modern linen. When the tomb of the Pharaoh Ramses II, who died in 1213 BC, was discovered in 1881, the linen wrappings were in a state of perfect preservation after more than 3000 years. When the tomb of Tutankhamen was opened, the linen curtains were found to be intact. In the Ulster Museum, Belfast there is the mummy of 'Takabuti' the daughter of a priest of Amun, who died 2,500 years ago.\\"Takabuti the ancient Egyptian mummy\\" - Ulster Museum, Egyptian Gallery The linen on this mummy is also in a perfect state of preservation. Diocletian's 4th century maximum prices edict showing prices for 3 grades of linen across the Roman Empire The earliest written documentation of a linen industry comes from the Linear B tablets of Pylos, Greece, where linen is depicted as an ideogram and also written as \\"li-no\\" (Greek: ŒªŒØŒΩŒøŒΩ, linon), and the female linen workers are cataloged as \\"li-ne-ya\\" (ŒªŒØŒΩŒµŒπŒ±, lineia).Flax and Linen Textiles in the Mycenaean palatial economy  Middle Ages  By the Middle Ages, there was a thriving trade in German flax and linen. The trade spread throughout Germany by the 9th century and spread to Flanders and Brabant by the 11th century. The Lower Rhine was a center of linen making in the Middle Ages. Flax was cultivated and linen used for clothing in Ireland by the 11th century. Evidence suggests that flax may have been grown and sold in Southern England in the 12th and 13th centuries. Textiles, primarily linen and wool, were produced in decentralized home weaving mills.  Modern history  Linen continued to be valued for garments in the 16th century and beyond. Specimens of linen garments worn by historical figures have survived. For example, a linen cap worn by Emperor Charles V was carefully preserved after his death in 1558. There is a long history of the production of linen in Ireland. When the Edict of Nantes was revoked in 1685, many of the Huguenots who fled France settled in the British Isles and elsewhere. They brought improved methods for linen production with them, contributing to the growth of the linen industry in Ireland in particular. Among them was Louis Crommelin, a leader who was appointed overseer of the royal linen manufacture of Ireland. He settled in the town of Lisburn near Belfast, which is itself perhaps the most famous linen producing center throughout history; during the Victorian era the majority of the world's linen was produced in the city which gained it the name Linenopolis. Although the linen industry was already established in Ulster, Louis Crommelin found scope for improvement in weaving, and his efforts were so successful that he was appointed by the Government to develop the industry over a much wider range than the small confines of Lisburn and its surroundings. The direct result of his good work was the establishment, under statute, of the Board of Trustees of the Linen Manufacturers of Ireland in the year 1711. Several grades were produced including coarse lockram. The Living Linen Project was set up in 1995 as an oral archive of the knowledge of the Irish linen industry, which was at that time still available within a nucleus of people who formerly worked in the industry in Ulster. The linen industry was increasingly critical in the economies of Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries. In England and then in Germany, industrialization and machine production replaced manual work and production moved from the home to new factories. Linen was also an important product in the American colonies, where it was brought over with the first settlers and became the most commonly used fabric and a valuable asset for colonial households. The homespun movement encouraged the use of flax to make home spun textiles. Through the 1830s, most farmers in the northern United States continued to grow flax for linen to be used for the family's clothing. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, linen was very significant to Russia and its economy. At one time it was the country's greatest export item and Russia produced about 80% of the world's fiber flax crop. In December 2006, the General Assembly of the United Nations proclaimed 2009 to be the International Year of Natural Fibres in order to raise people's awareness of linen and other natural fibers. Religion There are many references to linen throughout the Bible, reflecting the textile's entrenched presence in human cultures. In Judaism, the only law concerning which fabrics may be interwoven together in clothing concerns the mixture of linen and wool, called shaatnez; it is restricted in \\"Thou shalt not wear a mingled stuff, wool and linen together\\" and , \\"...neither shall there come upon thee a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together.\\" There is no explanation for this in the Torah itself and it is categorized as a type of law known as chukim, a statute beyond man's ability to comprehend.The Jewish Primer, by Shmuel Himelstein. New York, NY: Facts On File, 1990. First- century Romano-Jewish historian Josephus suggested that the reason for the prohibition was to keep the laity from wearing the official garb of the priests,Etz Hayim p. 1118 while medieval Sephardic Jewish philosopher Maimonides thought that the reason was because heathen priests wore such mixed garments.Guide for the Perplexed 3:37 Others explain that it is because God often forbids mixtures of disparate kinds, not designed by God to be compatible in a certain way, with mixing animal and vegetable fibers being similar to having two different types of plowing animals yoked together; also, such commands serve both a practical as well as allegorical purpose, perhaps here preventing a priestly garment that would cause discomfort (or excessive sweat) in a hot climate.Jamieson, Fausset, Brown commentary, Lv. 19:19 Linen is also mentioned in the Bible in Proverbs 31, a passage describing a noble wife. says, \\"She makes coverings for her bed; she is clothed in fine linen and purple.\\" Fine white linen is also worn by angels in the New Testament ().  Uses  Many products can be made with linen: aprons, bags, towels (swimming, bath, beach, body and wash towels), napkins, bed linens, tablecloths, runners, chair covers, and men's and women's wear. Today, linen is usually an expensive textile produced in relatively small quantities. It has a long staple (individual fiber length) relative to cotton and other natural fibers.Textiles, Ninth Edition by Sara J. Kadolph and Anna L. Langford. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall Linen fabric has been used for table coverings, bed coverings and clothing for centuries. The significant cost of linen derives not only from the difficulty of working with the thread, but also because the flax plant itself requires a great deal of attention. In addition flax thread is not elastic, and therefore it is difficult to weave without breaking threads. Thus linen is considerably more expensive to manufacture than cotton. The collective term \\"linens\\" is still often used generically to describe a class of woven or knitted bed, bath, table and kitchen textiles traditionally made of flax-based linen but today made from a variety of fibers. The term \\"linens\\" refers to lightweight undergarments such as shirts, chemises, waist-shirts, lingerie (a cognate with linen), and detachable shirt collars and cuffs, all of which were historically made almost exclusively out of linen. The inner layer of fine composite cloth garments (as for example dress jackets) was traditionally made of linen, hence the word lining.lining. Dictionary.com. Online Etymology Dictionary. Douglas Harper, Historian. (accessed: October 3, 2014). Bielefeld Germany linen Notgeld issued by Stadt-Sparkasse on 8 November 1923 Over the past 30 years the end use for linen has changed dramatically. Approximately 70% of linen production in the 1990s was for apparel textiles, whereas in the 1970s only about 5% was used for fashion fabrics. Linen uses range across bed and bath fabrics (tablecloths, bath towels, dish towels, bed sheets); home and commercial furnishing items (wallpaper/wall coverings, upholstery, window treatments); apparel items (suits, dresses, skirts, shirts); and industrial products (luggage, canvases, sewing thread). It was once the preferred yarn for handsewing the uppers of moccasin-style shoes (loafers), but has been replaced by synthetics. A linen handkerchief, pressed and folded to display the corners, was a standard decoration of a well-dressed man's suit during most of the first part of the 20th century. Currently researchers are working on a cotton/flax blend to create new yarns which will improve the feel of denim during hot and humid weather. Conversely, some brands such as 100% Capri specially treat the linen to look like denim. Linen fabric is one of the preferred traditional supports for oil painting. In the United States cotton is popularly used instead, as linen is many times more expensive there, restricting its use to professional painters. In Europe, however, linen is usually the only fabric support available in art shops; in the UK both are freely available with cotton being cheaper. Linen is preferred to cotton for its strength, durability and archival integrity. Linen is also used extensively by artisan bakers. Known as a couche, the flax cloth is used to hold the dough into shape while in the final rise, just before baking. The couche is heavily dusted with flour which is rubbed into the pores of the fabric. Then the shaped dough is placed on the couche. The floured couche makes a \\"non stick\\" surface to hold the dough. Then ridges are formed in the couche to keep the dough from spreading. In the past, linen was also used for books (the only surviving example of which is the Liber Linteus). Due to its strength, in the Middle Ages linen was used for shields, gambesons, and bowstrings; in classical antiquity it was used to make a type of body armour, referred to as a linothorax. Because of its strength when wet, Irish linen is a very popular wrap of pool/billiard cues, due to its absorption of sweat from hands. In 1923, the German city Bielefeld issued banknotes printed on linen. United States currency paper is made from 25% linen and 75% cotton. Flax fiber Description Flax stem cross-section, showing locations of underlying tissues. Ep = epidermis; C = cortex; BF = bast fibres; P = phloem; X = xylem; Pi = pith Linen is a bast fiber. Flax fibers vary in length from about 25 to 150 mm (1 to 6 in) and average 12‚Äì16 micrometers in diameter. There are two varieties: shorter tow fibers used for coarser fabrics and longer line fibers used for finer fabrics. Flax fibers can usually be identified by their ‚Äúnodes‚Äù which add to the flexibility and texture of the fabric. The cross-section of the linen fiber is made up of irregular polygonal shapes which contribute to the coarse texture of the fabric.Classifications & Analysis of Textiles: A Handbook by Karen L. LaBat, Ph.D. and Carol J. Salusso, Ph.A. University of Minnesota, 2003 Properties Linen fabric feels cool to touch, a phenomenon which indicates its higher conductivity (the same principle that makes metals feel \\"cold\\"). It is smooth, making the finished fabric lint-free, and gets softer the more it is washed. However, constant creasing in the same place in sharp folds will tend to break the linen threads. This wear can show up in collars, hems, and any area that is iron creased during laundering. Linen's poor elasticity means that it easily wrinkles. Mildew, perspiration, and bleach can damage the fabric, but because it is not made from animal fibers (keratin) it is impervious to clothes moths and carpet beetles. Linen is relatively easy to take care of, since it resists dirt and stains, has no lint or pilling tendency, and can be dry-cleaned, machine-washed, or steamed. It can withstand high temperatures, and has only moderate initial shrinkage. Linen should not be dried too much by tumble drying, and it is much easier to iron when damp. Linen wrinkles very easily, and thus some more formal garments require ironing often, in order to maintain perfect smoothness. Nevertheless, the tendency to wrinkle is often considered part of linen's particular \\"charm\\", and many modern linen garments are designed to be air-dried on a good clothes hanger and worn without the necessity of ironing. A characteristic often associated with linen yarn is the presence of slubs, or small, soft, irregular lumps, which occur randomly along its length. In the past, slubs were traditionally considered to be defects, and were associated with low quality linen. However, in the case of many present-day linen fabrics, particularly in the decorative furnishing industry, slubs are considered as part of the aesthetic appeal of an expensive natural product. In addition, slubs do not compromise the integrity of the fabric, and therefore they are not viewed as a defect. However, the very finest linen has very consistent diameter threads, with no slubs at all. Linen can degrade in a few weeks when buried in soil. Linen is more biodegradable than cotton. Measure The standard measure of bulk linen yarn is the \\"lea\\", which is the number of yards in a pound of linen divided by 300. For example, a yarn having a size of 1 lea will give 300 yards per pound. The fine yarns used in handkerchiefs, etc. might be 40 lea, and give 40x300 = 12,000 yards per pound. This is a specific length therefore an indirect measurement of the fineness of the linen, i.e., the number of length units per unit mass. The symbol is NeL.(3) The metric unit, Nm, is more commonly used in continental Europe. This is the number of 1,000 m lengths per kilogram. In China, the English Cotton system unit, NeC, is common. This is the number of 840 yard lengths in a pound.  Production method  Linen is laborious to manufacture. Details of the flax plant, from which linen fibers are derived baling of flax in Belgium. On the left side, cut flax is waiting to be baled. The quality of the finished linen product is often dependent upon growing conditions and harvesting techniques. To generate the longest possible fibers, flax is either hand-harvested by pulling up the entire plant or stalks are cut very close to the root. After harvesting, the plants are dried, and the seeds are removed through a mechanized process called ‚Äúrippling‚Äù (threshing) and winnowing. The fibers must then be loosened from the stalk. This is achieved through retting. This is a process which uses bacteria to decompose the pectin that binds the fibers together. Natural retting methods take place in tanks and pools, or directly in the fields. There are also chemical retting methods; these are faster, but are typically more harmful to the environment and to the fibers themselves. After retting, the stalks are ready for scutching, which takes place between August and December. Scutching removes the woody portion of the stalks by crushing them between two metal rollers, so that the parts of the stalk can be separated. The fibers are removed and the other parts such as linseed, shive, and tow are set aside for other uses. Next the fibers are heckled: the short fibers are separated with heckling combs by 'combing' them away, to leave behind only the long, soft flax fibers. After the fibers have been separated and processed, they are typically spun into yarns and woven or knit into linen textiles. These textiles can then be bleached, dyed, printed on, or finished with a number of treatments or coatings. An alternate production method is known as ‚Äúcottonizing‚Äù which is quicker and requires less equipment. The flax stalks are processed using traditional cotton machinery; however, the finished fibers often lose the characteristic linen look.  Producers  Flax is grown in many parts of the world, but top quality flax is primarily grown in Western European countries and Ukraine. In recent years bulk linen production has moved to Eastern Europe and China, but high quality fabrics are still confined to niche producers in Ireland, Italy and Belgium, and also in countries including Poland, Austria, France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, Britain and Kochi in India. High quality linen fabrics are now produced in the United States for the upholstery market and in Belgium. In 2018, according to the United Nations' repository of official international trade statistics, China was the top exporter of woven linen fabrics by trade value, with a reported $732.3 million in exports; Italy ($173.0 million), Belgium ($68.9 million) and the United Kingdom ($51.7 million) were also major exporters.

Image from the Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle A surcoat or surcote initially was an outer garment commonly worn in the Middle Ages by both men and women in Western Europe. It can either refer to a coat worn over other clothes or the outermost garment itself. The name derives from French meaning \\"over the coat\\", a long, loose, often sleeveless coat reaching down to the feet.Nunn, pp. 14, 23, 24, 28 History Men's surcoat From about the 12th century, knights wore long, flowing surcoats, frequently emblazoned with their personal arms, over their armor. These usually extended to about mid-calf, had slits in the bottom front and back, allowing the wearer to ride comfortably, and were either sleeved or sleeveless. Historians believe that the practice of wearing white surcoats was adopted during the Crusades, their main purpose being to reflect the direct sun, which overheated the armour (and the soldier inside) ‚Äì although it may be argued that here its color would have been of little help, while in poor weather they helped keep rain and the muck of battle away from the easily corroded mail links. The surcoat displayed the device of the knight (origin of the term \\"coat of arms\\"), thereby identifying him, which in turn, combined with the increased use of the great helm (late 12th century, early 13th century), became an essential means of recognition. Indeed, some historians cite this as one of the reasons behind the spread of heraldry across medieval Europe. During the 13th century, knights began to add plates of armour to their surcoats, subsequently giving rise to the medieval coat of plates. In the early fourteenth century, the front of the knight's surcoat was shortened so that it was longer at the back and knee-length at the front, allowing greater freedom of movement and eliminating the danger of a rider getting his spurs caught in the garment. By the mid-fourteenth century, it was replaced with the \\"jupon\\" (or \\"gipon\\"), a much shorter item, often padded for supplementary protection. In the 15th century, once suits of plate armour became common, the surcoat was phased out of use. This period in the history of armour development, in which surcoats became increasingly rare, is referred to as the \\"surcoatless period\\" (1420-1485). Women's surcoat Women began wearing surcoats during the 13th century, both with and without sleeves. A particular style, known as the sideless surcoat, developed as a fashion in the 14th century. This was a sleeveless, floor-length garment featuring exaggerated armholes, which at their most extreme were open from shoulder to hip, revealing the gown underneath. The narrow strip covering the torso, known as the plackard, was usually no more than a foot wide. The style drew criticism from some moralists, who thought the garment drew an inappropriate amount of attention to the female body. Despite this, sideless surcoats continued to be worn as ceremonial dress well into the 15th century, long after they had ceased to be fashionable. Some estimates place them being worn as state apparel as late as 1525.

The neologism technical describing such a vehicle is believed to have originated in Somalia during the Somali Civil War in the early 1990s. Barred from bringing in private security, non-governmental organizations hired local gunmen to protect their personnel, using money defined as \\"technical assistance grants\\". Eventually the term broadened to include any vehicle carrying armed men. However, an alternative account is given by Michael Maren, who says the term began in Somalia in the 80s, after engineers from Russian arms manufacturer Tekniko began mounting weapons on vehicles for the Somali National Movement. Technicals have also been referred to as battlewagons, gunwagons, or gunships. Among irregular armies, often centered on the perceived strength and charisma of warlords, the prestige of technicals is strong. According to one article, \\"The Technical is the most significant symbol of power in southern Somalia. It is a small truck with large tripod machine guns mounted on the back. A warlord's power is measured by how many of these vehicles he has.\\" Technicals are not commonly used by well-funded armies that are able to procure purpose- built combat vehicles, because the soft-skinned civilian vehicles that technicals are based on do not offer very good protection to their crew and passengers. Technicals fill the niche of traditional light cavalry. Their major asset is speed and mobility, as well as their ability to strike from unexpected directions with automatic fire and light troop deployment. Further, the reliability of vehicles such as the Toyota Hilux is useful for forces that lack the repair-related infrastructure of a conventional army. However, in direct engagements they are no match for heavier vehicles, such as tanks or other AFVs. History  Prototypes and early usage  SAS in armed jeeps, during the North African campaign of the World War Two Light improvised fighting vehicles date back to the first use of automobiles, and to the horse- drawn tachankas mounting machine guns in eastern Europe and Russia. At the Bombardment of Papeete during World War I, the French armed several Ford trucks with 37 mm guns to bolster their defense of the city. During the Spanish Civil War, field guns were fixed to lorries to act as improvised self- propelled guns, while improvised armoured cars were constructed by attaching steel plates to trucks.Beevor, Antony. The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939. Hachette UK, 2012. During World War II, various British and Commonwealth units, including the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG), the No. 1 Demolition Squadron or 'PPA' (Popski's Private Army), and the Special Air Service (SAS) were noted for their exploits in the deserts of Egypt, Libya and Chad using unarmored motor vehicles, often fitted with machine guns. Examples of LRDG vehicles include the Chevrolet WB 30 cwt Patrol Truck and the Willys MB Jeep. USMC launching a TOW missile during a 1980s training exercise at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center. The SAS' use of heavily armed Land Rovers continued post war with their use of Series 1 Land Rovers and later Series 11A 1968 Land Rovers in the Dhofar Rebellion. The SAS painted their Land Rovers pink as it was found to provide excellent camouflage in the desert and they were nicknamed 'Pink Panthers' or Pinkies. The SAS also used a more modern Land Rover Desert Patrol Vehicle (DPV) during Gulf War 1.http://www.eliteukforces.info/special-air-service/mobility-troop/sas-land- rover/ Western Sahara Tactics for employing technicals were pioneered by the Sahrawi People's Liberation Army, the armed wing of the Polisario Front, fighting for independence against Mauritania (1975‚Äì79) and Morocco (1975‚Äìpresent) from headquarters in Tindouf, Algeria. Algeria provided arms and Land Rovers to Sahrawi guerrillas, who successfully used them in long- range desert raids against the less agile conventional armies of their opponents, recalling Sahrawi tribal raids (ghazzis) of the pre-colonial period. Polisario later gained access to heavier equipment, but four-wheel drive vehicles remain a staple of their arsenal. The Moroccan army quickly changed their strategy and created mounted units using technicalshttps://sahara-question.com/fr/videos/8500 to challenge Polisario speed and hit & run strategies in the large desert, where they [Moroccan mounted units] proved their efficiency. Chadian‚ÄìLibyan conflict In 1987, Chadian troops equipped with technicals drove the heavily mechanized Libyan army from the Aozou Strip. The vehicles were instrumental in the victory at the Battle of Fada, and were driven over into Libya to raid military bases. It was discovered that these light vehicles could ride through anti-tank minefields without detonating the mines when driven at speeds over 100 km/h. The vehicles had become so famous that, in 1984, Time dubbed early stages of the conflict the \\"Great Toyota War\\". The Toyota War was unusual in that the force equipped with improvised vehicles prevailed over the force equipped with purpose-built fighting vehicles. MILAN anti-tank guided missiles provided by France were key to the Chadian success, while the Libyan forces were poorly deployed and organized. Somali Civil War Technicals played an important role in the 1990s Somali Civil War and the War in Somalia (2006‚Äì2009). After the fall of the Siad Barre regime and the collapse of the Somali National Army (SNA), it was rare for any Somali force to field armored fighting vehicles. However, technicals were very common. Somali faction leader Mohamed Farrah Aidid used 30 technicals along with a force of 600 militia to capture Baidoa in September 1995. After he was killed in clan fighting in 1996, his body was carried to his funeral on a Toyota pickup.\\"Somalis bury Aydiid \\", Reuters, August 2, 1996 (copy hosted by netnomad.com). Proving their susceptibility to heavy weapons and their value as a military prize, the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) was able to capture 30 \\"battlewagons\\" during the defeat of warlord Abdi Qeybdid's militia at the Second Battle of Mogadishu in 2006. That September, an impressive array of 130 technicals was used to take Kismayo from the forces of the Juba Valley Alliance. On November 13, 2006, then President of Puntland, General Adde Musa, personally led fifty technicals to Galkacyo to confront the Islamists. They were used a month later against the army of the Islamic Courts Union at the Battle of Bandiradley alongside Abdi Qeybdiid's reconstituted militia. However, forced into conventional battles in the War in Somalia (2006‚Äì2009) the unarmored technicals of the ICU proved no match for the T-55 tanks, Mil Mi-24 helicopter gunships and fighter-bombers employed by Ethiopia. War in Afghanistan In the War in Afghanistan, U.S. special forces are known to use technicals for patrol of the rugged terrain and the nature of their clandestine operations. The Taliban also used technicals while they were in power.http://www.newsweek.com/why-rebel-groups-love-toyota-hilux-74195 Iraq War Iraqi National Guard troops with a PK machine gun mounted on a fourth generation Ford Courier Technicals were used by Iraqi military forces in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The Iraqi Republican Guard and Fedayeen emulated tactics of the Somali National Alliance with limited success,\\"How the Pentagon's promise of a quick war ran into the desert sand\\", The Guardian, March 28, 2003. but were outmatched by Coalition armor and aviation. In the aftermath of the invasion technicals saw use by Iraqi insurgents for transporting personnel and quick raids against the Iraqi police forces. The insurgent use of technicals increased after the Iraq Spring Fighting of 2004. Many military utility vehicles have been modified to serve as gun trucks to protect Coalition convoys. The Humvee allows for weapon mounts by design, so it is not generally considered a technical. The Coalition also supplied technicals to the Iraqi police. Private military contractors also use technicals and the United States military used modified Toyota Tacoma pickups (purchased from auto showrooms in the U.S. and modified before delivery) as well. Darfur conflict Janjaweed militias use technicals on their raids against civilian villages in Darfur, Sudan,Jerome Taylor, \\"Janjaweed ditches horseback to launch attacks from 4x4s\\" , The Independent, 8 December 2006. Accessed 14 August 2008. as do the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) and Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) rebel troops in defense of their areas of operations. Light vehicles such as technicals are often thought to be more mobile than armored vehicles, but on one occasion an African peace-keeper driving a Grizzly AVGP whose guns had jammed, succeeded in catching up with, ramming and rolling over a fleeing Sudanese technical. Lebanon Introduced by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) guerrilla groups, technicals were extensively employed by all factions involved in the Lebanese Civil War between 1975 and 1990, including the Christian Lebanese Front and Muslim Lebanese National Movement (LNM) irregular militias, the Lebanese Army and the Internal Security Forces (ISF). Opposition forces have reportedly used technicals in the fighting for the Chouf District during the May 2008 clashes in Lebanon. Libyan civil war A ZU-23-2 technical used by the forces of the National Transitional Council during the Libyan civil war, in October 2011. During the Libyan Civil War, both regime loyalist forces as well as the anti-Gaddafi forces used technicals extensively. The type of warfare that had been carried out in the conflict‚Äîwherein highly mobile groups of soldiers and rebels continued to move to and from on the desert terrain, retreating at a time and then suddenly attacking to regain control of small towns and villages in the Eastern rebel held parts of Libya‚Äîhad led to the technical becoming a vehicle of choice for both sides. Technicals had also been widely used by the rebels whilst setting up checkpoints. It also formed a vast percentage of the rebel inventory which was limited to light weapons, light body armor and very few tanks. Some medium flatbed trucks carried the Soviet-made ZPU and ZU-23-2 towed anti-aircraft twin or quad barreled guns, as well as recoilless rifles and S-5 rocket helicopter rocket launcher pods. Some rebels have improvised with captured heavy weaponry, like BMP-1 turrets and helicopter rocket pods, as well as lower-tech methods such as using doorbells to ignite rocket- launched ammunition. Rebel technicals have also frequently employed BM-21 Grad rockets. Rocket tubes were salvaged from damaged regime Ural-375D trucks and mounted on the backs of pickups, with the technicals able to fire anywhere from one to six rockets.http://www.acus.org/content/rebel-fighter-celebrates- his-comrades-fire-rocket-barrage-toward-gaddafi-forces-west-ajdabiy Syrian Civil War Kurdish militia technical during the Syrian civil war In the ongoing Syrian Civil War, technicals are extensively used as improvised fighting vehicles, especially by opposition forces and the Al-Nusra Front, who largely lack conventional fighting vehicles. Syrian government forces also use technicals, but on a smaller scale. The kind of weapons mounted on technicals varies widely, including machine guns, recoilless rifles, anti-aircraft guns (commonly ZPU and ZU-23-2) and even BMP-1 turrets. The Military of ISIL extensively uses technicals in Iraq and Syria. SDF technical in a village captured from ISIS near Raqqa Peshmerga forces have used technicals to surround and attack ISIS targets.  War in Donbass  According to Gazeta.ru, during the 2014 war in Donbass both sides were using home-made military vehicles.  Yemeni Civil War  During the Yemeni Civil War (2015-present) Houthis and Hadi-aligned militias use technicals.  Composition  Technicals consist of weapons mounted on a four-wheel drive pickup truck. Many pickups have been used as technicals including Ford Ranger and Mitsubishi Triton, but the most favoured are the Toyota Hilux and Toyota Land Cruiser. They are typically fitted with heavy machine guns (especially the DShK and M2 Browning), anti-aircraft artillery (usually the ZPU or ZU-23-2), recoilless rifles (usually the SPG-9 or M40 recoilless rifle), and multiple rocket launchers such as the Type 63 or the M-63 Plamen. Optional add-ons include improvised vehicle armour such as welded steel plates defense against small arms fire.

It includes the cereal grasses, bamboos and the grasses of natural grassland and species cultivated in lawns and pasture. The latter are commonly referred to collectively as grass. With around 780 genera and around 12,000 species, the Poaceae is the fifth-largest plant family, following the Asteraceae, Orchidaceae, Fabaceae and Rubiaceae. The Poaceae are the most economically important plant family, providing staple foods from domesticated cereal crops such as maize, wheat, rice, barley, and millet as well as feed for meat-producing animals. They provide, through direct human consumption, just over one-half (51%) of all dietary energy; rice provides 20%, wheat supplies 20%, maize (corn) 5.5%, and other grains 6%. Some members of the Poaceae are used as building materials (bamboo, thatch, and straw); others can provide a source of biofuel, primarily via the conversion of maize to ethanol. Grasses have stems that are hollow except at the nodes and narrow alternate leaves borne in two ranks. The lower part of each leaf encloses the stem, forming a leaf-sheath. The leaf grows from the base of the blade, an adaptation allowing it to cope with frequent grazing. Grasslands such as savannah and prairie where grasses are dominant are estimated to constitute 40.5% of the land area of the Earth, excluding Greenland and Antarctica. Grasses are also an important part of the vegetation in many other habitats, including wetlands, forests and tundra. Though they are commonly called \\"grasses\\", seagrasses, rushes, and sedges fall outside this family. The rushes and sedges are related to the Poaceae, being members of the order Poales, but the seagrasses are members of order Alismatales.  Etymology  The name Poaceae was given by John Hendley Barnhart in 1895, based on the tribe Poeae described in 1814 by Robert Brown, and the type genus Poa described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus. The term is derived from the Ancient Greek œÄœåŒ± (p√≥a, \\"fodder\\").  Evolutionary history  Grasses include some of the most versatile plant life-forms. They became widespread toward the end of the Cretaceous period, and fossilized dinosaur dung (coprolites) have been found containing phytoliths of a variety that include grasses that are related to modern rice and bamboo. Grasses have adapted to conditions in lush rain forests, dry deserts, cold mountains and even intertidal habitats, and are currently the most widespread plant type; grass is a valuable source of food and energy for all sorts of wildlife and organics. A cladogram shows subfamilies and approximate species numbers in brackets: Before 2005, fossil findings indicated that grasses evolved around 55 million years ago. Recent findings of grass-like phytoliths in Cretaceous dinosaur coprolites have pushed this date back to 66 million years ago. In 2011, revised dating of the origins of the rice tribe Oryzeae suggested a date as early as 107 to 129 Mya. Wu, You & Li (2018) described grass microfossils extracted from a specimen of the hadrosauroid dinosaur Equijubus normani from the Early Cretaceous (Albian) Zhonggou Formation (China). The authors noted that India became separated from Antarctica, and therefore also all other continents, approximately at the beginning of late Aptian, so the presence of grasses in both India and China during the Cretaceous indicates that the ancestor of Indian grasses must have existed before late Aptian. Wu, You & Li considered the Barremian origin for grasses to be probable. The relationships among the three subfamilies Bambusoideae, Oryzoideae and Pooideae in the BOP clade have been resolved: Bambusoideae and Pooideae are more closely related to each other than to Oryzoideae. This separation occurred within the relatively short time span of about 4 million years. According to Lester Charles King the spread of grasses in the Late Cenozoic would have changed patterns of hillslope evolution favouring slopes that are convex upslope and concave downslope and lacking a free face were common. King argued that this was the result of more slowly acting surface wash caused by carpets of grass which in turn would have resulted in relatively more soil creep.  Description  Grasses may be annual or perennial herbs, generally with the following characteristics (the image gallery can be used for reference): The stems of grasses, called culms, are usually cylindrical (more rarely flattened, but not 3-angled) and are hollow, plugged at the nodes, where the leaves are attached. Grass leaves are nearly always alternate and distichous (in one plane), and have parallel veins. Each leaf is differentiated into a lower sheath hugging the stem and a blade with entire (i.e., smooth) margins. The leaf blades of many grasses are hardened with silica phytoliths, which discourage grazing animals; some, such as sword grass, are sharp enough to cut human skin. A membranous appendage or fringe of hairs called the ligule lies at the junction between sheath and blade, preventing water or insects from penetrating into the sheath. Parts of a right Flowers of Poaceae are characteristically arranged in spikelets, each having one or more florets. The spikelets are further grouped into panicles or spikes. The part of the spikelet that bears the florets is called the rachilla. A spikelet consists of two (or sometimes fewer) bracts at the base, called glumes, followed by one or more florets. A floret consists of the flower surrounded by two bracts, one external‚Äîthe lemma‚Äîand one internal‚Äîthe palea. The flowers are usually hermaphroditic‚Äîmaize being an important exception‚Äîand mainly anemophilous or wind-pollinated, although insects occasionally play a role. The perianth is reduced to two scales, called lodicules, that expand and contract to spread the lemma and palea; these are generally interpreted to be modified sepals. This complex structure can be seen in the image on the right, portraying a wheat (Triticum aestivum) spikelet. The fruit of grasses is a caryopsis, in which the seed coat is fused to the fruit wall. A tiller is a leafy shoot other than the first shoot produced from the seed.  Growth and development  Grass flowers Grass blades grow at the base of the blade and not from elongated stem tips. This low growth point evolved in response to grazing animals and allows grasses to be grazed or mown regularly without severe damage to the plant. Three general classifications of growth habit present in grasses: bunch-type (also called caespitose), stoloniferous, and rhizomatous. The success of the grasses lies in part in their morphology and growth processes and in part in their physiological diversity. There are both C3 and C4 grasses, referring to the photosynthetic pathway for carbon fixation. The C4 grasses have a photosynthetic pathway, linked to specialized Kranz leaf anatomy, which allows for increased water use efficiency, rendering them better adapted to hot, arid environments. The C3 grasses are referred to as \\"cool-season\\" grasses, while the C4 plants are considered \\"warm-season\\" grasses. * Annual cool-season ‚Äì wheat, rye, annual bluegrass (annual meadowgrass, Poa annua), and oat * Perennial cool-season ‚Äì orchardgrass (cocksfoot, Dactylis glomerata), fescue (Festuca spp.), Kentucky bluegrass and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) * Annual warm-season ‚Äì maize, sudangrass, and pearl millet * Perennial warm- season ‚Äì big bluestem, Indiangrass, Bermudagrass and switchgrass. Although the C4 species are all in the PACMAD clade (see diagram above), it seems that various forms of C4 have arisen some twenty or more times, in various subfamilies or genera. In the Aristida genus for example, one species (A. longifolia) is C3 but the approximately 300 other species are C4. As another example, the whole tribe of Andropogoneae, which includes maize, sorghum, sugar cane, \\"Job's tears\\", and bluestem grasses, is C4.  Distribution  The grass family is one of the most widely distributed and abundant groups of plants on Earth. Grasses are found on every continent, including Antarctica with the presence of Antarctic hair grass on the Antarctic Peninsula.  Ecology  A kangaroo eating grass Wind-blown grass in the Valles Caldera in New Mexico Grasses are the dominant vegetation in many habitats, including grassland, salt-marsh, reedswamp and steppes. They also occur as a smaller part of the vegetation in almost every other terrestrial habitat. Grass- dominated biomes are called grasslands. If only large, contiguous areas of grasslands are counted, these biomes cover 31% of the planet's land. Grasslands include pampas, steppes, and prairies. Grasses provide food to many grazing mammals‚Äîsuch as livestock, deer, and elephants‚Äîas well as to many species of butterflies and moths. Many types of animals eat grass as their main source of food, and are called graminivores ‚Äì these include cattle, sheep, horses, rabbits and many invertebrates, such as grasshoppers and the caterpillars of many brown butterflies. Grasses are also eaten by omnivorous or even occasionally by primarily carnivorous animals. Grasses are unusual in that the meristem is near the bottom of the plant; hence, grasses can quickly recover from cropping at the top. The evolution of large grazing animals in the Cenozoic contributed to the spread of grasses. Without large grazers, fire-cleared areas are quickly colonized by grasses, and with enough rain, tree seedlings. Trees eventually outcompete most grasses. Trampling grazers kill seedling trees but not grasses.  Taxonomy  There are about 12,000 grass species in about 771 genera that are classified into 12 subfamilies. See the full list of Poaceae genera. * Anomochlooideae Pilg. ex Potztal, a small lineage of broad-leaved grasses that includes two genera (Anomochloa, Streptochaeta) * Pharoideae L.G.Clark & Judz., a small lineage of grasses of three genera, including Pharus and Leptaspis * Puelioideae L.G.Clark, M.Kobay., S.Mathews, Spangler & E.A.Kellogg, a small lineage of the African genus Puelia * Pooideae, including wheat, barley, oats, brome-grass (Bromus), reed-grasses (Calamagrostis) and many lawn and pasture grasses such as bluegrass (Poa) Setaria verticillata from Panicoideae Tragus roxburghii from Chloridoideae * Bambusoideae, including bamboo * Ehrhartoideae, including rice and wild rice * Aristidoideae, including Aristida * Arundinoideae, including giant reed and common reed * Chloridoideae, including the lovegrasses (Eragrostis, about 350 species, including teff), dropseeds (Sporobolus, some 160 species), finger millet (Eleusine coracana (L.)

Their economic importance stems from several areas, including food production, industry, and lawns. They have been grown as food for domesticated animals for up to 6,000 years and the grains of grasses such as wheat, rice, maize (corn) and barley have been the most important human food crops. Grasses are also used in the manufacture of thatch, paper, fuel, clothing, insulation, timber for fencing, furniture, scaffolding and construction materials, floor matting, sports turf and baskets.  Food production  Agricultural grasses grown for their edible seeds are called cereals or grains (although the latter term, agriculturally, refers to both cereals and legumes). Of all crops grown, 70% are grasses. Three cereals-- rice, wheat, and maize (corn)--provide more than half of all calories consumed by humans. Cereals constitute the major source of carbohydrates for humans and perhaps the major source of protein, including rice (in southern and eastern Asia), maize (in Central and South America), and wheat and barley (in Europe, northern Asia and the Americas). Sugarcane is the major source of sugar production. Additional food uses of sugarcane include sprouted grain, shoots, and rhizomes, and in drink they include sugarcane juice and plant milk, as well as rum, beer, whisky, and vodka. Bamboo shoots are used in numerous Asian dishes and broths, and are available in supermarkets in various sliced forms, in both fresh, fermented and canned versions. Lemongrass is a grass used as a culinary herb for its citrus-like flavor and scent. Many species of grass are grown as pasture for foraging or as fodder for prescribed livestock feeds, particularly in the case of cattle, horses, and sheep. Such grasses may be cut and stored for later feeding, especially for the winter, in the form of bales of hay or straw, or in silos as silage. Straw (and sometimes hay) may also be used as bedding for animals.  Industry  Grasses are used as raw material for a multitude of purposes, including construction and in the composition of building materials such as cob, for insulation, in the manufacture of paper and board such as Oriented structural straw board. Grass fiber can be used for making paper, and for biofuel production.Bamboo scaffolding is able to withstand typhoon-force winds that would break steel scaffolding. Larger bamboos and Arundo donax have stout culms that can be used in a manner similar to timber, Arundo is used to make reeds for woodwind instruments, and bamboo is used for innumerable implements. 'Phragmites australis' (common reed) is important for thatching and grass roots stabilize the sod of sod houses. Reeds are used in water treatment systems, in wetland conservation and land reclamation in Afro-Eurasia. Marram grass (Ammophila arenaria)  Lawn and ornamental use  A lawn in front of a building Grasses are the primary plant used in lawns, which themselves derive from grazed grasslands in Europe. They also provide an important means of erosion control (e.g., along roadsides), especially on sloping land. Grass lawns are an important covering of playing surfaces in many sports, including football (soccer), American football, tennis, golf, cricket, softball and baseball. Ornamental grasses, such as perennial bunch grasses, are used in many styles of garden design for their foliage, inflorescences, seed heads. They are often used in natural landscaping, xeriscaping and slope stabilization in contemporary landscaping, wildlife gardening, and native plant gardening.  Sports turf  Forms of grass are used to cover baseball fields, like this one in Citi Field, home of the New York Mets. Grass playing fields, courses and pitches are the traditional playing surfaces for many sports, including American football, association football, baseball, cricket, golf, and rugby. Grass surfaces are also sometimes used for horse racing and tennis. Type of maintenance and species of grass used may be important factors for some sports, less critical for others. In some sports facilities, including indoor domes and other places where maintenance of a grass field would be difficult, grass may be replaced with artificial turf, a synthetic grass-like substitute. = Cricket = The gray area is the cricket pitch currently in use. Parallel to it are other pitches in various states of preparation which could be used in other matches. In cricket, the pitch is the strip of carefully mowed and rolled grass where the bowler bowls. In the days leading up to the match it is repeatedly mowed and rolled to produce a very hard, flat surface for the ball to bounce off. = Golf = Grass on golf courses is kept in three distinct conditions: that of the rough, the fairway, and the putting green. Grass on the fairway is mown short and even, allowing the player to strike the ball cleanly. Playing from the rough is a disadvantage because the long grass may affect the flight of the ball. Grass on the putting green is the shortest and most even, ideally allowing the ball to roll smoothly over the surface. An entire industry revolves around the development and marketing of grass varieties for golf courses. = Tennis = In tennis, grass is grown on very hard-packed soil, and the bounce of a tennis ball may vary depending on the grass's health, how recently it has been mowed, and the wear and tear of recent play. The surface is softer than hard courts and clay (other tennis surfaces), so the ball bounces lower, and players must reach the ball faster resulting in a different style of play which may suit some players more than others. Among the world's most prestigious court for grass tennis is Centre Court at Wimbledon, London which hosts the final of the annual Wimbledon Championships in England, one of the four Grand Slam tournaments.

They have been cultivated as feed for people and domesticated animals for thousands of years. The primary ingredient of beer is usually barley or wheat, both of which have been used for this purpose for over 4,000 years. In some places, particularly in suburban areas, the maintenance of a grass lawn is a sign of a homeowner's responsibility to the overall appearance of their neighborhood. One work credits lawn maintenance to: Many US municipalities and homeowners' associations have rules which require lawns to be maintained to certain specifications, sanctioning those who allow the grass to grow too long. In communities with drought problems, watering of lawns may be restricted to certain times of day or days of the week. The smell of the freshly cut grass is produced mainly by cis-3-Hexenal. Some common aphorisms involve grass. For example: * \\"The grass is always greener on the other side\\" suggests an alternate state of affairs will always seem preferable to one's own. * \\"Don't let the grass grow under your feet\\" tells someone to get moving. * \\"A snake in the grass\\" means dangers that are hidden. * \\"When elephants fight, it is the grass which suffers\\" tells of bystanders caught in the crossfire. A folk myth about grass is that it refuses to grow where any violent death has occurred.Olmert, Michael (1996).

Elliot Smith, Charles Dawson, Arthur Smith Woodward. Front row: A. S. Underwood, Arthur Keith, W. P. Pycraft, and Ray Lankester. Note the portrait of Charles Darwin on the wall. Painting by John Cooke, 1915. The Piltdown Man was a paleoanthropological fraud in which bone fragments were presented as the fossilised remains of a previously unknown early human. Although there were doubts about its authenticity virtually from the beginning, the remains were still broadly accepted for many years, and the falsity of the hoax was only definitively demonstrated in 1953. An extensive scientific review in 2016 established that amateur archaeologist Charles Dawson was its likely perpetrator. In 1912, Charles Dawson claimed that he had discovered the \\"missing link\\" between ape and man. In February 1912, Dawson contacted Arthur Smith Woodward, Keeper of Geology at the Natural History Museum, stating he had found a section of a human-like skull in Pleistocene gravel beds near Piltdown, East Sussex. That summer, Dawson and Smith Woodward purportedly discovered more bones and artifacts at the site, which they connected to the same individual. These finds included a jawbone, more skull fragments, a set of teeth, and primitive tools. Smith Woodward reconstructed the skull fragments and hypothesised that they belonged to a human ancestor from 500,000 years ago. The discovery was announced at a Geological Society meeting and was given the Latin name Eoanthropus dawsoni (\\"Dawson's dawn-man\\"). The questionable significance of the assemblage remained the subject of considerable controversy until it was conclusively exposed in 1953 as a forgery. It was found to have consisted of the altered mandible and some teeth of an orangutan deliberately combined with the cranium of a fully developed, though small-brained, modern human. The Piltdown hoax is prominent for two reasons: the attention it generated around the subject of human evolution, and the length of time, 41 years, that elapsed from its alleged initial discovery to its definitive exposure as a composite forgery. Find Piltdown Man skull reconstruction At a meeting of the Geological Society of London on 18 December 1912, Charles Dawson claimed that a workman at the Piltdown gravel pit had given him a fragment of the skull four years earlier. According to Dawson, workmen at the site discovered the skull shortly before his visit and broke it up in the belief that it was a fossilised coconut. Revisiting the site on several occasions, Dawson found further fragments of the skull and took them to Arthur Smith Woodward, keeper of the geological department at the British Museum. Greatly interested by the finds, Woodward accompanied Dawson to the site. Though the two worked together between June and September 1912, Dawson alone recovered more skull fragments and half of the lower jaw bone. The skull unearthed in 1908 was the only find discovered in situ, with most of the other pieces found in the gravel pit's spoil heaps. At the same meeting, Woodward announced that a reconstruction of the fragments indicated that the skull was in many ways similar to that of a modern human, except for the occiput (the part of the skull that sits on the spinal column), and brain size, which was about two-thirds that of a modern human. He went on to indicate that, save for two human-like molar teeth, the jaw bone was indistinguishable from that of a modern, young chimpanzee. From the British Museum's reconstruction of the skull, Woodward proposed that Piltdown Man represented an evolutionary missing link between apes and humans, since the combination of a human-like cranium with an ape-like jaw tended to support the notion then prevailing in England that human evolution began with the brain. A 1913 reconstruction of \\"Eoanthropus dawsoni\\" Almost from the outset, Woodward's reconstruction of the Piltdown fragments was strongly challenged by some researchers. At the Royal College of Surgeons, copies of the same fragments used by the British Museum in their reconstruction were used to produce an entirely different model, one that in brain size and other features resembled a modern human. This reconstruction, by Prof. (later Sir) Arthur Keith, was called Homo piltdownensis in reflection of its more human appearance. The find was also considered legitimate by Otto Schoetensack who had discovered the Heidelberg fossils just a few years earlier; he described it as being the best evidence for an ape-like ancestor of modern humans.Russell, Miles. 2012. The Piltdown Man Hoax: Case Closed. History press. p. 81 French Jesuit paleontologist and geologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin participated in the uncovering of the Piltdown skull with Woodward. Woodward's reconstruction included ape-like canine teeth, which was itself controversial. In August 1913, Woodward, Dawson and Teilhard de Chardin began a systematic search of the spoil heaps specifically to find the missing canines. Teilhard de Chardin soon found a canine that, according to Woodward, fitted the jaw perfectly. A few days later, Teilhard de Chardin moved to France and took no further part in the discoveries. Noting that the tooth \\"corresponds exactly with that of an ape\\", Woodward expected the find to end any dispute over his reconstruction of the skull. However, Keith attacked the find. Keith pointed out that human molars are the result of side to side movement when chewing. The canine in the Piltdown jaw was impossible as it prevented side to side movement. To explain the wear on the molar teeth, the canine could not have been any higher than the molars. Grafton Elliot Smith, a fellow anthropologist, sided with Woodward, and at the next Royal Society meeting claimed that Keith's opposition was motivated entirely by ambition. Keith later recalled, \\"Such was the end of our long friendship.\\" As early as 1913, David Waterston of King's College London published in Nature his conclusion that the sample consisted of an ape mandible and human skull. Likewise, French paleontologist Marcellin Boule concluded the same thing in 1915. A third opinion from the American zoologist Gerrit Smith Miller concluded that Piltdown's jaw came from a fossil ape. In 1923, Franz Weidenreich examined the remains and correctly reported that they consisted of a modern human cranium and an orangutan jaw with filed- down teeth. Sheffield Park find In 1915, Dawson claimed to have found three fragments of a second skull (Piltdown II) at a new site about two miles away from the original finds. Woodward attempted several times to elicit the location from Dawson, but was unsuccessful. So far as is known, the site was never identified and the finds appear largely undocumented. Woodward did not present the new finds to the Society until five months after Dawson's death in August 1916 and deliberately implied that he knew where they had been found. In 1921, Henry Fairfield Osborn, President of the American Museum of Natural History, examined the Piltdown and Sheffield Park finds and declared that the jaw and skull belonged together \\"without question\\" and that the Sheffield Park fragments \\"were exactly those which we should have selected to confirm the comparison with the original type.\\" The Sheffield Park finds were taken as proof of the authenticity of the Piltdown Man; it may have been chance that brought an ape's jaw and a human skull together, but the odds of its happening twice were slim. Even Keith conceded to this new evidence, though he still harboured personal doubts. Memorial The Piltdown Man memorial stone. On 23 July 1938, at Barkham Manor, Piltdown, Sir Arthur Keith unveiled a memorial to mark the site where Piltdown Man was discovered by Charles Dawson. Sir Arthur finished his speech saying: The inscription on the memorial stone reads: Exposure Scientific investigation From the outset, some scientists expressed scepticism about the Piltdown find (see above). G.S. Miller, for example, observed in 1915 that \\"deliberate malice could hardly have been more successful than the hazards of deposition in so breaking the fossils as to give free scope to individual judgment in fitting the parts together\\". In the decades prior to its exposure as a forgery in 1953, scientists increasingly regarded Piltdown as an enigmatic aberration inconsistent with the path of hominid evolution as demonstrated by fossils found elsewhere. In November 1953, Time magazine published evidence gathered variously by Kenneth Page Oakley, Sir Wilfrid Edward Le Gros Clark and Joseph Weiner proving that the Piltdown Man was a forgeryEnd as a Man. Time Magazine 30 Nov 1953 retrieved 11 November 2010 and demonstrating that the fossil was a composite of three distinct species. It consisted of a human skull of medieval age, the 500-year- old lower jaw of an orangutan and chimpanzee fossil teeth. Someone had created the appearance of age by staining the bones with an iron solution and chromic acid. Microscopic examination revealed file-marks on the teeth, and it was deduced from this that someone had modified the teeth to a shape more suited to a human diet. The Piltdown Man hoax succeeded so well because, at the time of its discovery, the scientific establishment believed that the large modern brain preceded the modern omnivorous diet, and the forgery provided exactly that evidence. It has also been thought that nationalism and cultural prejudice played a role in the less-than-critical acceptance of the fossil as genuine by some British scientists. It satisfied European expectations that the earliest humans would be found in Eurasia, and the British, it has been claimed, also wanted a first Briton to set against fossil hominids found elsewhere in Europe. Identity of the forger The identity of the Piltdown forger remains unknown, but suspects have included Dawson, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Arthur Keith, Martin A. C. Hinton, Horace de Vere Cole and Arthur Conan Doyle.Lukas, Mary (May 1981). \\"Teilhard and the Piltdown 'Hoax'\\" . America.Bartlett, Kate (17 February 2011). \\"Piltdown Man: Britain's Greatest Hoax\\" . BBC History. Dawson's \\"Toad in the Hole\\". Booth Museum of Natural History, Brighton The focus on Charles Dawson as the main forger is supported by the accumulation of evidence regarding other archaeological hoaxes he perpetrated in the decade or two before the Piltdown discovery. The archaeologist Miles Russell of Bournemouth University analysed Dawson's antiquarian collection, and determined that at least 38 of his specimens were fakes. Among these were the teeth of a reptile/mammal hybrid, Plagiaulax dawsoni, \\"found\\" in 1891 (and whose teeth had been filed down in the same way that the teeth of Piltdown Man were to be some 20 years later); the so-called \\"shadow figures\\" on the walls of Hastings Castle; a unique hafted stone axe; the Bexhill boat (a hybrid seafaring vessel); the Pevensey bricks (allegedly the latest datable \\"finds\\" from Roman Britain); the contents of the Lavant Caves (a fraudulent \\"flint mine\\"); the Beauport Park \\"Roman\\" statuette (a hybrid iron object); the Bulverhythe Hammer (shaped with an iron knife in the same way as the Piltdown elephant bone implement would later be); a fraudulent \\"Chinese\\" bronze vase; the Brighton \\"Toad in the Hole\\" (a toad entombed within a flint nodule); the English Channel sea serpent; the Uckfield Horseshoe (another hybrid iron object) and the Lewes Prick Spur. Of his antiquarian publications, most demonstrate evidence of plagiarism or at least naive referencing, Russell wrote: \\"Piltdown was not a 'one-off' hoax, more the culmination of a life's work.\\" In addition, Harry Morris, an acquaintance of Dawson, had come into possession of one of the flints obtained by Dawson at the Piltdown gravel pit. He suspected that it had been artificially aged ‚Äì \\"stained by C. Dawson with intent to defraud\\". He remained deeply suspicious of Dawson for many years to come, though he never sought to discredit him publicly, possibly because it would have been an argument against the eolith theory, which Morris strongly supported.Weiner, The Piltdown Forgery, pp. 140‚Äì45. In a documentary about the Piltdown Man, American writer John Evangelist Walsh said about the identity of the forger: \\"I‚Äôll give you his name without hesitation and without making you wait. Charles Dawson was the perpetrator. Alone, by himself without the least bit of help.\\"History's Mysteries: Hoax of the Ages ‚Äì Piltdown Man (History Channel, 1999) Professor Adrian Lister of the UK's Natural History Museum has said that \\"some people have suggested\\" that there may also have been a second 'fraudster' seeking to use outrageous fraud in the hope of anonymously exposing the original frauds. This was a theory first proposed by Miles Russell. He has explained that the piece nicknamed the 'cricket bat' (a fossilised elephant bone) was such a crudely forged 'early tool' that it may have been planted to cast doubt upon the other finds, the 'Earliest Englishman' in effect being recovered with the earliest evidence for the game of cricket. This seems to have been part of a wider attempt, by disaffected members of the Sussex archaeological community, to expose Dawson's activities, other examples being the obviously fraudulent 'Maresfield Map', the 'Ashburnham Dial', and the 'Piltdown Palaeolith'. Nevertheless, the 'cricket bat' was accepted at the time, even though it aroused the suspicions of some and ultimately helped lead to the eventual recognition of the fraud decades later. In 2016, the results of an eight-year review of the forgery were released, identifying Dawson's modus operandi. Multiple specimens demonstrated the same consistent preparation: application of the stain, packing of crevices with local gravel, and fixation of teeth and gravel with dentist's putty. Analysis of shape and trace DNA showed that teeth from both sites belonged to the same orangutan. The consistent method and common source indicated the work of one person on all the specimens, and Dawson was the only one associated with Piltdown II. The authors did not rule out the possibility that someone else provided the false fossils to Dawson, but ruled out several other suspects, including Teilhard de Chardin and Doyle, based on the skill and knowledge demonstrated by the forgeries, which closely reflected ideas fashionable in biology at the time. Stephen Jay Gould judges that Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was the main culprit of the Piltdown forgery. Teilhard de Chardin had travelled to regions of Africa where one of the anomalous finds originated, and resided in the Wealden area from the date of the earliest finds. Hinton left a trunk in storage at the Natural History Museum in London that in 1970 was found to contain animal bones and teeth carved and stained in a manner similar to the carving and staining on the Piltdown finds. On the other hand, Amir D. Aczel says that \\"Teilhard was without doubt innocent in this matter\\". Phillip Tobias implicated Arthur Keith in helping Dawson by detailing the history of the investigation of the hoax, dismissing other theories, and listing inconsistencies in Keith's statements and actions.Phillip V. Tobias. 1992. Piltdown: An Appraisal of the Case against Sir Arthur Keith. Current Anthropology, Vol. 33, No. 3 (Jun. 1992), pp. 243‚Äì93 with Comments and Reply by Peter J. Bowler, Andrew T. Chamberlain, Christopher Chippindale, Robin W. Dennell, F. G. Fedele, Paul Graves, Caroline Grigson, G. Ainsworth Harrison, Francis B. Harrold, Kenneth A. R. Kennedy, Martin K. Nickels, Nicolas Rolland, Curtis Runnels, Frank Spencer, C. B. Stringer, N. C. Tappen, Bruce G. Trigger, Sherwood Washburn and R. V. S. Wright. Other investigations suggest that the hoax involved accomplices rather than a single forger. Legacy A replica of the Piltdown Man skull. Early humans In 1912, the majority of the scientific community believed the Piltdown Man was the ‚Äúmissing link‚Äù between apes and humans. However, over time the Piltdown Man lost its validity, as other discoveries such as Taung Child and Peking Man were found. R. W. Ehrich and G. M. Henderson note, \\"To those who are not completely disillusioned by the work of their predecessors, the disqualification of the Piltdown skull changes little in the broad evolutionary pattern. The validity of the specimen has always been questioned\\".\\"Culture area\\", in International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences, vol. 3, pp. 563‚Äì68. (New York: Macmillan/The Free Press). Eventually, during the 1940s and 1950s, more advanced dating technologies, such as the fluorine absorption test, proved scientifically that this skull was actually a fraud. Influence The Piltdown Man fraud significantly affected early research on human evolution. Notably, it led scientists down a blind alley in the belief that the human brain expanded in size before the jaw adapted to new types of food. Discoveries of Australopithecine fossils such as the Taung child found by Raymond Dart during the 1920s in South Africa were ignored due to the support for Piltdown Man as \\"the missing link,\\" and the reconstruction of human evolution was confused for decades. The examination and debate over Piltdown Man caused a vast expenditure of time and effort on the fossil, with an estimated 250+ papers written on the topic. The fossil was introduced as evidence by Clarence Darrow in defense of John Scopes during the 1925 Scopes Monkey Trial. Darrow died in 1938, fifteen years before Piltdown Man was exposed as a fraud. Creationists often cite the hoax (along with Nebraska Man) as evidence of an alleged dishonesty of paleontologists who study human evolution, despite the fact that scientists themselves had exposed the Piltdown hoax (and the Nebraska Man incident was not a deliberate fraud). In November 2003, the Natural History Museum in London held an exhibition to mark the 50th anniversary of the exposure of the fraud. Biases in the interpretation of the Piltdown Man The Piltdown case is an example of how racial and nationalist factors shaped some science at the time. Piltdown's semi-human features were explained by some scientists using reference to non- white ethnicities whom some Europeans and Americans of that time considered a lower form of human. The influence of nationalism is clear in the differing interpretations of the find: whilst the majority of British scientists accepted the discovery as \\"the earliest Englishman\\", European and American scientists were considerably more sceptical, and several suggested at the time that the skull and jaw were from two different creatures and had been accidentally mixed up. Regarding the sex of the find, it was discussed as a male, although Woodward suggested that the specimen discovered might be female. The only exception to this was in coverage by the Daily Express newspaper, which referred to the discovery as a woman, but only to use it to mock the Suffragette movement of the time, of which the Express was highly critical.

It has also been produced artificially, and is often known as \\"green gold\\". The gold content of naturally occurring electrum in modern Western Anatolia ranges from 70% to 90%, in contrast to the 45‚Äì55% of gold in electrum used in ancient Lydian coinage of the same geographical area. This suggests that one reason for the invention of coinage in that area was to increase the profits from seigniorage by issuing currency with a lower gold content than the commonly circulating metal. (See also debasement.) Electrum was used as early as the third millennium BC in Old Kingdom of Egypt, sometimes as an exterior coating to the pyramidions atop ancient Egyptian pyramids and obelisks. It was also used in the making of ancient drinking vessels. The first metal coins ever made were of electrum and date back to the end of the 7th century or the beginning of the 6th century BC. For several decades, the medals awarded with the Nobel Prize have been made of gold-plated green gold. Etymology The name \\"electrum\\" is the Latinized form of the Greek word ·º§ŒªŒµŒ∫œÑœÅŒøŒΩ (·∏ólektron), mentioned in the Odyssey referring to a metallic substance consisting of gold alloyed with silver. The same word was also used for the substance amber, likely because of the pale yellow colour of certain varieties. It is from amber's electrostatic properties that the modern English words \\"electron\\" and \\"electricity\\" are derived. Electrum was often referred to as \\"white gold\\" in ancient times, but could be more accurately described as \\"pale gold\\", as it is usually pale yellow or yellowish-white in colour. The modern use of the term white gold usually concerns gold alloyed with any one or a combination of nickel, silver, platinum and palladium to produce a silver-coloured gold. Composition Electrum consists primarily of gold and silver but is sometimes found with traces of platinum, copper, and other metals. The name is mostly applied informally to compositions between about 20‚Äì80% gold and 20‚Äì80% silver atoms, but these are strictly called gold or silver depending on the dominant element. Analysis of the composition of electrum in ancient Greek coinage dating from about 600 BC shows that the gold content was about 55.5% in the coinage issued by Phocaea. In the early classical period, the gold content of electrum ranged from 46% in Phokaia to 43% in Mytilene. In later coinage from these areas, dating to 326 BC, the gold content averaged 40% to 41%. In the Hellenistic period, electrum coins with a regularly decreasing proportion of gold were issued by the Carthaginians. In the later Eastern Roman Empire controlled from Constantinople, the purity of the gold coinage was reduced, and an alloy that can be called electrum began to be used. History Lydian electrum coin (one-third stater), one of the oldest known coins, early 6th century BC. Electrum coin of the Byzantine Emperor Alexius I Comnenus, . A mummified male head covered in electrum, from Ancient Egypt, Roman period, 2nd century AD (Mus√©e des beaux-arts de Lyon). Electrum is mentioned in an account of an expedition sent by Pharaoh Sahure of the Fifth Dynasty of Egypt. It is also discussed by Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia. Electrum is also mentioned in the Hebrew Scriptures, whose prophet Ezekiel is said to have had a vision of Jehovah on a celestial chariot (Ezekiel 1:4). Early coinage The earliest known electrum coins, Lydian and East Greek coins found under the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, are currently dated to the last quarter of the 7th century BC (625‚Äì600 BC). Electrum is believed to have been used in coins c. 600 BC in Lydia during the reign of Alyattes. Electrum was much better for coinage than gold, mostly because it was harder and more durable, but also because techniques for refining gold were not widespread at the time. The discrepancy between gold content of electrum from modern Western Anatolia (70‚Äì90%) and ancient Lydian coinage (45‚Äì55%) suggests that the Lydians had already solved the refining technology for silver and were adding refined silver to the local native electrum some decades before introducing the pure silver coins cited below. In Lydia, electrum was minted into coins weighing , each valued at stater (meaning \\"standard\\"). Three of these coins‚Äîwith a weight of about ‚Äîtotaled one stater, about one month's pay for a soldier. To complement the stater, fractions were made: the trite (third), the hekte (sixth), and so forth, including of a stater, and even down to and of a stater. The stater was only about to . Larger denominations, such as a one stater coin, were minted as well. Because of variation in the composition of electrum, it was difficult to determine the exact worth of each coin. Widespread trading was hampered by this problem, as the intrinsic value of each electrum coin could not be easily determined. These difficulties were eliminated circa 570 BC when the Croeseids, coins of pure gold and silver were introduced. However, electrum currency remained common until approximately 350 BC. The simplest reason for this was that, because of the gold content, one 14.1 gram stater was worth as much as ten 14.1 gram silver pieces.

They may also occur on the face, usually on the eyelids. Though tags up to a 12.7 mm long have been seen, they are typically the size of a grain of rice. The surface of an acrochordon may be smooth or irregular in appearance and is often raised from the surface of the skin on a fleshy stalk called a peduncle.

A dairy is typically located on a dedicated dairy farm or in a section of a multi-purpose farm (mixed farm) that is concerned with the harvesting of milk. As an attributive, the word dairy refers to milk-based products, derivatives and processes, and the animals and workers involved in their production: for example dairy cattle, dairy goat. A dairy farm produces milk and a dairy factory processes it into a variety of dairy products. These establishments constitute the global dairy industry, a component of the food industry. Terminology Terminology differs between countries. in the United States, for example, an entire dairy farm is commonly called a \\"dairy\\". The building or farm area where milk is harvested from the cow is often called a \\"milking parlor\\" or \\"parlor\\", except in the case of smaller dairies, where cows are often put on pasture, and usually milked in \\"stanchion barns\\". The farm area where milk is stored in bulk tanks is known as the farm's \\"milk house\\". Milk is then hauled (usually by truck) to a \\"dairy plant\\", also referred to as a \\"dairy\\", where raw milk is further processed and prepared for commercial sale of dairy products. In New Zealand, farm areas for milk harvesting are also called \\"milking parlours\\", and are historically known as \\"milking sheds\\". As in the United States, sometimes milking sheds are referred to by their type, such as \\"herring bone shed\\" or \\"pit parlour\\". Parlour design has evolved from simple barns or sheds to large rotary structures in which the workflow (throughput of cows) is very efficiently handled. In some countries, especially those with small numbers of animals being milked, the farm may perform the functions of a dairy plant, processing their own milk into salable dairy products, such as butter, cheese, or yogurt. This on-site processing is a traditional method of producing specialist milk products, common in Europe. In the United States a dairy can also be a place that processes, distributes and sells dairy products, or a room, building or establishment where milk is stored and processed into milk products, such as butter or cheese. In New Zealand English the singular use of the word dairy almost exclusively refers to a corner shop, or superette. This usage is historical as such shops were a common place for the public to buy milk products.  History  Milk producing animals have been domesticated for thousands of years. Initially, they were part of the subsistence farming that nomads engaged in. As the community moved about the country, their animals accompanied them. Protecting and feeding the animals were a big part of the symbiotic relationship between the animals and the herders. In the more recent past, people in agricultural societies owned dairy animals that they milked for domestic and local (village) consumption, a typical example of a cottage industry. The animals might serve multiple purposes (for example, as a draught animal for pulling a plow as a youngster, and at the end of its useful life as meat). In this case, the animals were normally milked by hand and the herd size was quite small, so that all of the animals could be milked in less than an hour‚Äîabout 10 per milker. These tasks were performed by a dairymaid (dairywoman) or dairyman. The word dairy harkens back to Middle English dayerie, deyerie, from deye (female servant or dairymaid) and further back to Old English d√¶ge (kneader of bread). With industrialization and urbanization, the supply of milk became a commercial industry, with specialized breeds of cattle being developed for dairy, as distinct from beef or draught animals. Initially, more people were employed as milkers, but it soon turned to mechanization with machines designed to do the milking. Farmer milking a cow by hand Historically, the milking and the processing took place close together in space and time: on a dairy farm. People milked the animals by hand; on farms where only small numbers are kept, hand-milking may still be practiced. Hand-milking is accomplished by grasping the teats (often pronounced tit or tits) in the hand and expressing milk either by squeezing the fingers progressively, from the udder end to the tip, or by squeezing the teat between thumb and index finger, then moving the hand downward from udder towards the end of the teat. The action of the hand or fingers is designed to close off the milk duct at the udder (upper) end and, by the movement of the fingers, close the duct progressively to the tip to express the trapped milk. Each half or quarter of the udder is emptied one milk-duct capacity at a time. The stripping action is repeated, using both hands for speed. Both methods result in the milk that was trapped in the milk duct being squirted out the end into a bucket that is supported between the knees (or rests on the ground) of the milker, who usually sits on a low stool. Traditionally the cow, or cows, would stand in the field or paddock while being milked. Young stock, heifers, would have to be trained to remain still to be milked. In many countries, the cows were tethered to a post and milked. Structure of the industry Wawa Dairy Farms in Pennsylvania While most countries produce their own milk products, the structure of the dairy industry varies in different parts of the world. In major milk-producing countries most milk is distributed through whole sale markets. In Ireland and Australia, for example, farmers' co-operatives own many of the large-scale processors, while in the United States many farmers and processors do business through individual contracts. In the United States, the country's 196 farmers' cooperatives sold 86% of milk in the U.S. in 2002, with five cooperatives accounting for half that. This was down from 2,300 cooperatives in the 1940s. In developing countries, the past practice of farmers marketing milk in their own neighborhoods is changing rapidly. Notable developments include considerable foreign investment in the dairy industry and a growing role for dairy cooperatives. Output of milk is growing rapidly in such countries and presents a major source of income growth for many farmers.FAO, Milk for Health and Wealth, FAO, Rome, 2009 As in many other branches of the food industry, dairy processing in the major dairy producing countries has become increasingly concentrated, with fewer but larger and more efficient plants operated by fewer workers. This is notably the case in the United States, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. In 2009, charges of antitrust violations have been made against major dairy industry players in the United States, which critics call Big Milk.Independent Farmers Feel Squeezed By Milk Cartel by John Burnett. All Things Considered, National Public Radio. 20 August 2009. Another round of price fixing charges was settled in 2016. Government intervention in milk markets was common in the 20th century. A limited antitrust exemption was created for U.S. dairy cooperatives by the Capper‚ÄìVolstead Act of 1922. In the 1930s, some U.S. states adopted price controls, and Federal Milk Marketing Orders started under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 and continue in the 2000s. The Federal Milk Price Support Program began in 1949. The Northeast Dairy Compact regulated wholesale milk prices in New England from 1997 to 2001. Plants producing liquid milk and products with short shelf life, such as yogurts, creams and soft cheeses, tend to be located on the outskirts of urban centres close to consumer markets. Plants manufacturing items with longer shelf life, such as butter, milk powders, cheese and whey powders, tend to be situated in rural areas closer to the milk supply. Most large processing plants tend to specialise in a limited range of products. Exceptionally, however, large plants producing a wide range of products are still common in Eastern Europe, a holdover from the former centralized, supply-driven concept of the market under Communist governments. As processing plants grow fewer and larger, they tend to acquire bigger, more automated and more efficient equipment. While this technological tendency keeps manufacturing costs lower, the need for long-distance transportation often increases the environmental impact.Cleaner Production Assessment in Dairy Processing , by COWI Consulting Engineers and Planners, United Nations Environment Programme Division of Technology, Industry, and Economics, Denmark Milj√∏styrelsen. Published by UNEP/Earthprint, 2000 (). Text at Agrifood Forum - Publications - Downloads - Sector Guides - Index. Milk production is irregular, depending on cow biology. Producers must adjust the mix of milk which is sold in liquid form vs. processed foods (such as butter and cheese) depending on changing supply and demand. Milk supply contracts In the European Union, milk supply contracts are regulated by Article 148 of Regulation 1308/2013 - Establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products and repealing Council Regulations (EEC) No 922/72, (EEC) No 234/79, (EC) No 1037/2001 and (EC) No 1234/2007, which permits member states to create a requirement for the supply of milk from a farmer to a raw milk processor to be backed by a written contract, or to ensure that the first purchaser of milk to make a written offer to the farmer, although in this case the farmer may not be required to enter into a contract.European Union, Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products and repealing Council Regulations (EEC) No 922/72, (EEC) No 234/79, (EC) No 1037/2001 and (EC) No 1234/2007, Article 148 published 20 December 2013, accessed 25 September 2020 Thirteen EU member states including France and Spain have introduced laws on compulsory or mandatory written milk contracts (MWC's) between farmers and processors. The Scottish Government published an analysis of the dairy supply chain and the application of mandatory written contracts across the European Union in 2019, to evaluate the impact of the contracts where they have been adopted.Scottish Government, Dairy contracts in European countries: research, published 19 November 2019, accessed 7 October 2020 In the UK, a voluntary code of best practice on contractual relationships in the dairy sector was agreed by industry during 2012: this set out minimum standards of good practice for contracts between producers and purchasers.DEFRA, Contractual relationships in the UK dairy industry, published 24 June 2020, accessed 7 October 2020 During 2020 the UK government has undertaken a consultation exercise to determine which contractual measures, if any, would improve the resilience of the dairy industry for the future.DEFRA, Consultation: Contractual relationships in the UK dairy industry, June 2020, accessed 7 October 2020, p. 6 The Australian government has also introduced a mandatory dairy code of conduct. Farming British Palestine, 1936 When it became necessary to milk larger cows, the cows would be brought to a shed or barn that was set up with stalls (milking stalls) where the cows could be confined their whole life while they were milked. One person could milk more cows this way, as many as 20 for a skilled worker. But having cows standing about in the yard and shed waiting to be milked is not good for the cow, as she needs as much time in the paddock grazing as is possible. It is usual to restrict the twice-daily milking to a maximum of an hour and a half each time. It makes no difference whether one milks 10 or 1000 cows, the milking time should not exceed a total of about three hours each day for any cow as they should be in stalls and laying down as long as possible to increase comfort which will in turn aid in milk production. A cow is physically milked for only about 10 minutes a day depending on her milk letdown time and the number of milkings per day. As herd sizes increased there was more need to have efficient milking machines, sheds, milk-storage facilities (vats), bulk-milk transport and shed cleaning capabilities and the means of getting cows from paddock to shed and back. As herd numbers increased so did the problems of animal health. In New Zealand two approaches to this problem have been used. The first was improved veterinary medicines (and the government regulation of the medicines) that the farmer could use. The other was the creation of veterinary clubs where groups of farmers would employ a veterinarian (vet) full-time and share those services throughout the year. It was in the vet's interest to keep the animals healthy and reduce the number of calls from farmers, rather than to ensure that the farmer needed to call for service and pay regularly. This daily milking routine goes on for about 300 to 320 days per year that the cow stays in milk. Some small herds are milked once a day for about the last 20 days of the production cycle but this is not usual for large herds. If a cow is left unmilked just once she is likely to reduce milk-production almost immediately and the rest of the season may see her dried off (giving no milk) and still consuming feed. However, once-a-day milking is now being practised more widely in New Zealand for profit and lifestyle reasons. This is effective because the fall in milk yield is at least partially offset by labour and cost savings from milking once per day. This compares to some intensive farm systems in the United States that milk three or more times per day due to higher milk yields per cow and lower marginal labor costs. Farmers who are contracted to supply liquid milk for human consumption (as opposed to milk for processing into butter, cheese, and so on‚Äîsee milk) often have to manage their herd so that the contracted number of cows are in milk the year round, or the required minimum milk output is maintained. This is done by mating cows outside their natural mating time so that the period when each cow in the herd is giving maximum production is in rotation throughout the year. Northern hemisphere farmers who keep cows in barns almost all the year usually manage their herds to give continuous production of milk so that they get paid all year round. In the southern hemisphere the cooperative dairying systems allow for two months on no productivity because their systems are designed to take advantage of maximum grass and milk production in the spring and because the milk processing plants pay bonuses in the dry (winter) season to carry the farmers through the mid-winter break from milking. It also means that cows have a rest from milk production when they are most heavily pregnant. Some year-round milk farms are penalised financially for overproduction at any time in the year by being unable to sell their overproduction at current prices. Artificial insemination (AI) is common in all high-production herds in order to improve the genetics of the female offspring which will be raised for replacements. AI also reduces the need for keeping potentially dangerous bulls on the farm. Male calves are sold to be raised for beef or veal. A cow will calve or freshen about once a year, until she is culled because of declining production, infertility or other health problems. Then the cow will be sold, most often going to slaughter. Industrial processing A Fonterra cooperative dairy factory in Australia Interior of a cheese factory in Seine- et-Marne, France Dairy plants process the raw milk they receive from farmers so as to extend its marketable life. Two main types of processes are employed: heat treatment to ensure the safety of milk for human consumption and to lengthen its shelf-life, and dehydrating dairy products such as butter, hard cheese and milk powders so that they can be stored. Cream and butter Today, milk is separated by huge machines in bulk into cream and skim milk. The cream is processed to produce various consumer products, depending on its thickness, its suitability for culinary uses and consumer demand, which differs from place to place and country to country. Some milk is dried and powdered, some is condensed (by evaporation) mixed with varying amounts of sugar and canned. Most cream from New Zealand and Australian factories is made into butter. This is done by churning the cream until the fat globules coagulate and form a monolithic mass. This butter mass is washed and, sometimes, salted to improve keeping qualities. The residual buttermilk goes on to further processing. The butter is packaged (25 to 50 kg boxes) and chilled for storage and sale. At a later stage these packages are broken down into home-consumption sized packs. Skimmed milk The product left after the cream is removed is called skim, or skimmed, milk. To make a consumable liquid a portion of cream is returned to the skim milk to make low fat milk (semi-skimmed) for human consumption. By varying the amount of cream returned, producers can make a variety of low-fat milks to suit their local market. Whole milk is also made by adding cream back to the skim to form a standardized product. Other products, such as calcium, vitamin D, and flavouring, are also added to appeal to consumers. Casein Casein is the predominant phosphoprotein found in fresh milk. It has a very wide range of uses from being a filler for human foods, such as in ice cream, to the manufacture of products such as fabric, adhesives, and plastics. Cheese Cheese is another product made from milk. Whole milk is reacted to form curds that can be compressed, processed and stored to form cheese. In countries where milk is legally allowed to be processed without pasteurization, a wide range of cheeses can be made using the bacteria found naturally in the milk. In most other countries, the range of cheeses is smaller and the use of artificial cheese curing is greater. Whey is also the byproduct of this process. Some people with lactose intolerance are surprisingly able to eat certain types of cheese. This is because some traditionally made hard cheeses, and soft ripened cheeses may create less reaction than the equivalent amount of milk because of the processes involved. Fermentation and higher fat content contribute to lesser amounts of lactose. Traditionally made Emmental or Cheddar might contain 10% of the lactose found in whole milk. In addition, the aging methods of traditional cheeses (sometimes over two years) reduce their lactose content to practically nothing. Commercial cheeses, however, are often manufactured by processes that do not have the same lactose-reducing properties. Ageing of some cheeses is governed by regulations; in other cases there is no quantitative indication of degree of ageing and concomitant lactose reduction, and lactose content is not usually indicated on labels. Whey In earlier times, whey or milk serum was considered to be a waste product and it was, mostly, fed to pigs as a convenient means of disposal. Beginning about 1950, and mostly since about 1980, lactose and many other products, mainly food additives, are made from both casein and cheese whey. Yogurt Yogurt (or yoghurt) making is a process similar to cheese making, only the process is arrested before the curd becomes very hard. Milk powders Milk is also processed by various drying processes into powders. Whole milk, skim milk, buttermilk, and whey products are dried into a powder form and used for human and animal consumption. The main difference between production of powders for human or for animal consumption is in the protection of the process and the product from contamination. Some people drink milk reconstituted from powdered milk, because milk is about 88% water and it is much cheaper to transport the dried product. Other milk products Kumis is produced commercially in Central Asia. Although traditionally made from mare's milk, modern industrial variants may use cow's milk. In India, which produces 22% of global milk production (as at 2018), a range of traditional milk-based products are produced commercially. Milking Preserved Express Dairies three-axle Milk Tank Wagon at the Didcot Railway Centre, based on an SR chassis Milk churns on a railway platform Originally, milking and processing took place on the dairy farm itself. Later, cream was separated from the milk by machine on the farm, and transported to a factory to be made into butter. The skim milk was fed to pigs. This allowed for the high cost of transport (taking the smallest volume high-value product), primitive trucks and the poor quality of roads. Only farms close to factories could afford to take whole milk, which was essential for cheesemaking in industrial quantities, to them. Originally milk was distributed in 'pails', a lidded bucket with a handle. These proved impractical for transport by road or rail, and so the milk churn was introduced, based on the tall conical shape of the butter churn. Later large railway containers, such as the British Railway Milk Tank Wagon were introduced, enabling the transport of larger quantities of milk, and over longer distances. The development of refrigeration and better road transport, in the late 1950s, has meant that most farmers milk their cows and only temporarily store the milk in large refrigerated bulk tanks, from where it is later transported by truck to central processing facilities. In many European countries, particularly the United Kingdom, milk is then delivered direct to customers' homes by a milk float. In the United States, a dairy cow produced about of milk per year in 1950, while the average Holstein cow in 2019 produces more than of milk per year. Milking machines The milking machine extracts milk from all teats. Milking machines are used to harvest milk from cows when manual milking becomes inefficient or labour- intensive. One early model was patented in 1907. The milking unit is the portion of a milking machine for removing milk from an udder. It is made up of a claw, four teatcups, (Shells and rubber liners) long milk tube, long pulsation tube, and a pulsator. The claw is an assembly that connects the short pulse tubes and short milk tubes from the teatcups to the long pulse tube and long milk tube. (Cluster assembly) Claws are commonly made of stainless steel or plastic or both. Teatcups are composed of a rigid outer shell (stainless steel or plastic) that holds a soft inner liner or inflation. Transparent sections in the shell may allow viewing of liner collapse and milk flow. The annular space between the shell and liner is called the pulse chamber. Milking machines work in a way that is different from hand milking or calf suckling. Continuous vacuum is applied inside the soft liner to massage milk from the teat by creating a pressure difference across the teat canal (or opening at the end of the teat). Vacuum also helps keep the machine attached to the cow. The vacuum applied to the teat causes congestion of teat tissues (accumulation of blood and other fluids). Atmospheric air is admitted into the pulsation chamber about once per second (the pulsation rate) to allow the liner to collapse around the end of teat and relieve congestion in the teat tissue. The ratio of the time that the liner is open (milking phase) and closed (rest phase) is called the pulsation ratio. The four streams of milk from the teatcups are usually combined in the claw and transported to the milkline, or the collection bucket (usually sized to the output of one cow) in a single milk hose. Milk is then transported (manually in buckets) or with a combination of airflow and mechanical pump to a central storage vat or bulk tank. Milk is refrigerated on the farm in most countries either by passing through a heat-exchanger or in the bulk tank, or both. The photo to the right shows a bucket milking system with the stainless steel bucket visible on the far side of the cow. The two rigid stainless steel teatcup shells applied to the front two quarters of the udder are visible. The top of the flexible liner is visible at the top of the shells as are the short milk tubes and short pulsation tubes extending from the bottom of the shells to the claw. The bottom of the claw is transparent to allow observation of milk flow. When milking is completed the vacuum to the milking unit is shut off and the teatcups are removed. Milking machines keep the milk enclosed and safe from external contamination. The interior 'milk contact' surfaces of the machine are kept clean by a manual or automated washing procedures implemented after milking is completed. Milk contact surfaces must comply with regulations requiring food-grade materials (typically stainless steel and special plastics and rubber compounds) and are easily cleaned. Most milking machines are powered by electricity but, in case of electrical failure, there can be an alternative means of motive power, often an internal combustion engine, for the vacuum and milk pumps. Milking shed layouts Milking parlour at Pardes Hanna Agricultural High School, Israel =Bail-style sheds= This type of milking facility was the first development, after open-paddock milking, for many farmers. The building was a long, narrow, lean-to shed that was open along one long side. The cows were held in a yard at the open side and when they were about to be milked they were positioned in one of the bails (stalls). Usually the cows were restrained in the bail with a breech chain and a rope to restrain the outer back leg. The cow could not move about excessively and the milker could expect not to be kicked or trampled while sitting on a (three-legged) stool and milking into a bucket. When each cow was finished she backed out into the yard again. The UK bail, initially developed by Wiltshire dairy farmer Arthur Hosier, was a six standing mobile shed with steps that the cow mounted, so the herdsman didn't have to bend so low. The milking equipment was much as today, a vacuum from a pump, pulsators, a claw- piece with pipes leading to the four shells and liners that stimulate and suck the milk from the teat. The milk went into churns, via a cooler. As herd sizes increased a door was set into the front of each bail so that when the milking was done for any cow the milker could, after undoing the leg-rope and with a remote link, open the door and allow her to exit to the pasture. The door was closed, the next cow walked into the bail and was secured. When milking machines were introduced bails were set in pairs so that a cow was being milked in one paired bail while the other could be prepared for milking. When one was finished the machine's cups are swapped to the other cow. This is the same as for Swingover Milking Parlours as described below except that the cups are loaded on the udder from the side. As herd numbers increased it was easier to double-up the cup-sets and milk both cows simultaneously than to increase the number of bails. About 50 cows an hour can be milked in a shed with 8 bails by one person. Using the same teat cups for successive cows has the danger of transmitting infection, mastitis, from one cow to another. Some farmers have devised their own ways to disinfect the clusters between cows. =Herringbone milking parlours= In herringbone milking sheds, or parlours, cows enter, in single file, and line up almost perpendicular to the central aisle of the milking parlour on both sides of a central pit in which the milker works (you can visualise a fishbone with the ribs representing the cows and the spine being the milker's working area; the cows face outward). After washing the udder and teats the cups of the milking machine are applied to the cows, from the rear of their hind legs, on both sides of the working area. Large herringbone sheds can milk up to 600 cows efficiently with two people. =Swingover milking parlours= Swingover parlours are the same as herringbone parlours except they have only one set of milking cups to be shared between the two rows of cows, as one side is being milked the cows on the other side are moved out and replaced with unmilked ones. The advantage of this system is that it is less costly to equip, however it operates at slightly better than half-speed and one would not normally try to milk more than about 100 cows with one person. 80-stand rotary dairy that is fully computerised and records milk production =Rotary milking sheds= Rotary milking sheds (also known as Rotary milking parlor) consist of a turntable with about 12 to 100 individual stalls for cows around the outer edge. A \\"good\\" rotary will be operated with 24‚Äì32 (~48‚Äì50+) stalls by one (two) milkers. The turntable is turned by an electric-motor drive at a rate that one turn is the time for a cow to be milked completely. As an empty stall passes the entrance a cow steps on, facing the center, and rotates with the turntable. The next cow moves into the next vacant stall and so on. The operator, or milker, cleans the teats, attaches the cups and does any other feeding or whatever husbanding operations that are necessary. Cows are milked as the platform rotates. The milker, or an automatic device, removes the milking machine cups and the cow backs out and leaves at an exit just before the entrance. The rotary system is capable of milking very large herds‚Äîover a thousand cows. =Automatic milking sheds= Automatic milking or 'robotic milking' sheds can be seen in Australia, New Zealand, the U.S., Canada, and many European countries. Current automatic milking sheds use the voluntary milking (VM) method. These allow the cows to voluntarily present themselves for milking at any time of the day or night, although repeat visits may be limited by the farmer through computer software. A robot arm is used to clean teats and apply milking equipment, while automated gates direct cow traffic, eliminating the need for the farmer to be present during the process. The entire process is computer controlled. =Supplementary accessories in sheds= Farmers soon realised that a milking shed was a good place to feed cows supplementary foods that overcame local dietary deficiencies or added to the cows' wellbeing and production. Each bail might have a box into which such feed is delivered as the cow arrives so that she is eating while being milked. A computer can read the eartag of each animal to ration the correct individual supplement. A close alternative is to use 'out-of-parlour-feeders', stalls that respond to a transponder around the cow's neck that is programmed to provide each cow with a supplementary feed, the quantity dependent on her production, stage in lactation, and the benefits of the main ration The holding yard at the entrance of the shed is important as a means of keeping cows moving into the shed. Most yards have a powered gate that ensures that the cows are kept close to the shed. Water is a vital commodity on a dairy farm: cows drink about 20 gallons (80 litres) a day, sheds need water to cool and clean them. Pumps and reservoirs are common at milking facilities. Water can be warmed by heat transfer with milk. Temporary milk storage Milk coming from the cow is transported to a nearby storage vessel by the airflow leaking around the cups on the cow or by a special \\"air inlet\\" (5-10 l/min free air) in the claw. From there it is pumped by a mechanical pump and cooled by a heat exchanger. The milk is then stored in a large vat, or bulk tank, which is usually refrigerated until collection for processing. Waste disposal Manure spreader going to the field from a dairy farm, Elba, New York. In countries where cows are grazed outside year-round, there is little waste disposal to deal with. The most concentrated waste is at the milking shed, where the animal waste may be liquefied (during the water-washing process) or left in a more solid form, either to be returned to be used on farm ground as organic fertilizer. In the associated milk processing factories, most of the waste is washing water that is treated, usually by composting, and spread on farm fields in either liquid or solid form. This is much different from half a century ago, when the main products were butter, cheese and casein, and the rest of the milk had to be disposed of as waste (sometimes as animal feed). In dairy-intensive areas, various methods have been proposed for disposing of large quantities of milk. Large application rates of milk onto land, or disposing in a hole, is problematic as the residue from the decomposing milk will block the soil pores and thereby reduce the water infiltration rate through the soil profile. As recovery of this effect can take time, any land-based application needs to be well managed and considered. Other waste milk disposal methods commonly employed include solidification and disposal at a solid waste landfill, disposal at a wastewater treatment plant, or discharge into a sanitary sewer. Associated diseases Dairy products manufactured under unsanitary or unsuitable conditions have an increased chance of containing bacteria. Proper sanitation practices help to reduce the rate of bacterial contamination, and pasteurization greatly decreases the amount of contaminated milk that reaches the consumer. Many countries have required government oversight and regulations regarding dairy production, including requirements for pasteurization. * Leptospirosis is an infection that can be transmitted to people who work in dairy production through exposure to urine or to contaminated water or soil. * Cowpox is a virus that today is rarely found in either cows or humans. It is a historically important disease, as it led to the first vaccination against the now eradicated smallpox. * Tuberculosis is able to be transmitted from cattle mainly via milk products that are unpasteurised. The disease has been eradicated from many countries by testing for the disease and culling suspected animals. * Brucellosis is a bacterial disease transmitted to humans by dairy products and direct animal contact. Brucellosis has been eradicated from certain countries by testing for the disease and culling suspected animals. * Listeria is a bacterial disease associated with unpasteurised milk, and can affect some cheeses made in traditional ways. Careful observance of the traditional cheesemaking methods achieves reasonable protection for the consumer. * Crohn's disease has been linked to infection with the bacterium M. paratuberculosis, which has been found in pasteurized retail milk in the UK and the USA. M. paratuberculosis causes a similar disorder, Johne's disease, in livestock. Animal welfare A portion of the population,Iacobbo, K., & Iacobbo, M. (2006). Vegetarians and vegans in America today. Greenwood Publishing Group. including many vegans and Jains, object to dairy production as unethical, cruel to animals, and environmentally deleterious. They do not consume dairy products. They state that cattle suffer under conditions employed by the dairy industry. Bovine growth hormone In 1937, it was found that bovine somatotropin (BST or bovine growth hormone) would increase the yield of milk. Several pharmaceutical companies developed commercial rBST products and they have been approved for use in the US, Mexico, Brazil, India, Russia, and at least ten others. The World Health Organization, and others have stated that dairy products and meat from BST-treated cows are safe for human consumption. However, based on negative animal welfare effects, rBST has not been allowed in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Israel, or the European Union since 2000 - and in the U.S. has lost popularity due to consumer demands for rBST- free cows, with only about 17% of all cows in America now receiving rBST.

In federations, governor may be the title of a politician who governs a constituent state and may be either appointed or elected. The power of the individual governor can vary dramatically between political systems, with some governors having only nominal or largely ceremonial power, with others having complete control over the entire government. Historically, the title can also apply to the executive officials acting as representatives of a chartered company which has been granted exercise of sovereignty in a colonial area, such as the British East India Company or the Dutch East India Company. These companies operate as a major state within a state with its own armed forces. There can also be non- political governors: high-ranking officials in private or similar governance such as commercial and non-profit management, styled governor(s), who simply govern an institution, such as a corporation or a bank. For example, in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries, there are prison governors (\\"wardens\\" in the United States), school governors and bank governors. The adjective pertaining to a governor is gubernatorial, from the Latin root gubernare. The obsolete term for a female governor is the female form governess, however the modern term for female officials is the gender-neutral form governor (without the gender-specific suffix -ess) to avoid confusion with other meanings of governess. Ancient empires Pre-Roman empires Though the legal and administrative framework of provinces, each administrated by a governor, was created by the Romans, the term governor has been a convenient term for historians to describe similar systems in antiquity. Indeed, many regions of the pre-Roman antiquity were ultimately replaced by Roman 'standardized' provincial governments after their conquest by Rome. Egypt *In Pharaonic times, the governors of each of the various provinces in the kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt (called \\"nomes\\" by the Greeks, and whose names often alluded to local patterns of religious worship) are usually known by the Greek word. Pre- and Hellenistic satraps * Media and Achaemenid Persia introduced the satrapy, probably inspired by the Assyrian / Babylonian examples * Alexander the Great and equally Hellenistic diadoch kingdoms, mainly Seleucids (greater Syria) and Lagids ('Ptolemies' in Hellenistic Egypt) * in later Persia, again under Iranian dynasties:  Parthia  the Sassanid dynasty dispensed with the office after Shapur I (who had still 7 of them), replacing them with petty vassal rulers, known as shahdars Ancient Rome From the creation of the earliest Roman subject provinces, a governor was appointed each year to administer each of them. The core function of a Roman governor was as a magistrate or judge, and the management of taxation and the public spending in their area. Under the Republic and the early Empire, however, a governor also commanded military forces in his province. Republican governors were all men who had served in senior magistracies (the consulate or praetorship) in Rome in the previous year, and carried related titles as governor (proconsul or propraetor). The first Emperor, Octavianus Augustus (who acquired or settled a number of new territories; officially his style was republican: Princeps civitatis), divided the provinces into two categories; the traditionally prestigious governorships remained as before (in what have become known as \\"senatorial\\" provinces), while in a range of others, he retained the formal governorship himself, delegating the actual task of administration to appointees (usually with the title legatus Augusti). The legatus sometimes would appoint a prefect (later procurator), usually a man of equestrian rank, to act as his deputy in a subregion of the larger province: the infamous character of Pontius Pilate in the Christian Gospels was a governor of this sort. A special case was Egypt, a rich 'private' domain and vital granary, where the Emperor almost inherited the theocratic status of a Pharaoh. The Emperor was represented there by a governor sui generis styled praefectus augustalis, a title evoking the religious cult of the Emperor. Emperors Diocletian (see Tetrarchy) and Constantine in the third and fourth centuries AD carried out a root and branch reorganisation of the administration with two main features: *Provinces were divided up and became much more numerous (Italy itself, before the 'colonizing homeland', was brought into the system for the first time); they were then grouped into dioceses, and the dioceses in turn into four praetorian prefectures (originally each under a residing co-emperor); *Military responsibilities were removed from governors and given to new officials called comes rei militaris (the comital title was also granted to many court and civilian administrative positions) or dux, later also magister militum. The prestigious governorships of Africa and Asia remained with the title proconsul, and the special right to refer matters directly to the Emperor; the praefectus augustalis in Alexandria and the comes Orientis in Antioch also retained special titles. Otherwise, the governors of provinces had various titles, some known as consularis, some as corrector, while others as praeses. Apart from Egypt and the East (Oriens ‚Äì viz greater Syria), each diocese was directed by a governor known as a vicarius. The prefectures were directed by praefecti praetorio (greatly transformed in their functions from their role in the early Empire). Byzantium This system survived with few significant changes until the collapse of the empire in the West, and in the East, the breakdown of order with the Persian and Arab invasions of the seventh century. At that stage, a new kind of governor emerged, the Strategos. It was a role leading the themes which replaced provinces at this point, involving a return to the amalgamation of civil and military office which had been the practice under the Republic and the early Empire. Legacy While the Roman administration in the West was largely destroyed in the barbarian invasions, its model was remembered; this model became very influential through two particular vehicles: Roman law and the Christian Church. Holy Roman/ Habsburg Empires and successor states *Reichskommissar Turkish rule In the Ottoman Empire, all Pashas (generals) administered a province of the Great Sultan's vast empire, with specific titles (such as Mutessaryf; Vali or WƒÅli which was often maintained and revived in the oriental successor states; Beilerbei (rendered as Governor-general, as he is appointed above several provinces under individual governors) and Dey) British Empire and Commonwealth Realm Flag of the Governor of Gibraltar, 1982‚ÄìPresent In the British Empire, a governor was originally an official appointed by the British monarch (or the cabinet) to oversee one of his colonies and was the (sometimes notional) head of the colonial administration. A governor's power could diminish as the colony gained a more responsible government vested in such institutions as an Executive Council to help with the colony's administration, and in a further stage of self-government, Legislative Councils or Assemblies, in which the Governor often had a role. Today, crown colonies of the United Kingdom continue to be administered by a governor, who holds varying degrees of power. Because of the different constitutional histories of the former colonies of the United Kingdom, the term \\"Governor\\" now refers to officials with differing amounts of power. Administrators, Commissioners and High Commissioners exercise similar powers to Governors. (Note: such High Commissioners are not to be confused with the High Commissioners who are the equivalent of Ambassadors between Commonwealth states). Frequently the name 'Government House' is given to Governors' residences. :The term can also be used in a more generic sense, especially for compound titles which include it: Governor-general and Lieutenant-governor. Vice-regal governors =United Kingdom overseas territories= In the United Kingdom's remaining overseas territories, the governor is normally a direct appointee of the British Government and plays an active role in governing and lawmaking (though usually with the advice of elected local representatives). The Governor's chief responsibility is for the Defence and External Affairs of the colony. In some minor overseas territories, instead of a Governor, there is an Administrator or Commissioner, or the position is held ex officio by a High Commissioner. = Australia = In Australia, each state has the governor as its formal representative of the Queen, as head of the state government. It is not a political office but a ceremonial one. Each state governor is appointed by the Queen of Australia on the advice of the Premier, who is the political chief executive of the state government (until 1986, state governors were appointed by the Queen of the United Kingdom on the advice of the British Government). State Governors have emergency reserve powers but these are rarely used. The Territories of Australia other than the ACT have Administrators instead of governors, who are appointed formally by the Governor-general. The Governor-General is the representative of and appointed by the Queen of Australia at a federal level on the advice of the Prime Minister of Australia. As with the Governors-General of Australia and other Commonwealth Realms, State Governors usually exercise their power only on the advice of a government minister. = Canada = In Canada, there are governors at the federal and provincial levels of government who, within their jurisdictions, act as representatives of the Queen of Canada, who is Canada's Head of State. The federal governor is the Governor General of Canada, and the governor of each province is the Lieutenant Governor. The Governor General is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister of Canada, whereas the lieutenant governors are appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister. The role of the Governor General and of the lieutenant governors in Canada is largely ceremonial, although they do retain the authority to exercise reserve powers in exceptional circumstances. Each of the three territories is headed by a commissioner appointed by the federal Cabinet. Unlike provincial lieutenant governors, they are not representatives of the Queen, but rather are representatives of the federal government. = British Hong Kong (1841‚Äì1997) = In the colonial period of Hong Kong, the governor was the representative of the Sovereign from 1843, which was the year that the authorities and duties of the post were officially defined by the Hong Kong Letters Patent and the Royal Instructions, until the handover of Hong Kong to the PRC government in 1997. Each governor was appointed by the monarch and possessed significant powers such as the power of appointing lawmakers in the Legislative Council, the power to grant land, the power of veto over bills and motions, the power of pardon, etc. At the same time, the governor was also the head of the colonial cabinet, the chairman of the Executive Council, the President of the Legislative Council (until 1993), as well as the commander-in-chief of the British Forces in Hong Kong. =New Zealand= The Governor-General of New Zealand is always the Governor of the Ross Dependency, an Antarctic sector which is claimed by the Realm of New Zealand. =Within the United Kingdom= Within the United Kingdom itself, there was a position of Governor of Northern Ireland from 1922 until the suspension of the devolved Parliament of Northern Ireland in 1973. =Within England= From the 16th century until 1995, there was a Governor of the Isle of Wight, part of England. Since the reign of Henry VIII, the monarch has borne the title of Supreme Governor of the Church of England. Other colonial empires European powers other than the United Kingdom, with colonies in Asia, Africa and elsewhere, gave their top representatives in their colonies the title of governor. Those representatives could be from chartered companies that ruled the colonies. In some of these colonies, there are still officials called governors. See: *Danish colonial empire *Dutch Empire *Empire of Japan *French colonial empire *German colonial empire *Italian empire *Portuguese Empire *Spanish Empire *Swedish overseas colonies Russia and former Soviet Union In the Russian Empire, Governorate (Guberniya) and Governorate-General were the main units of territorial and administrative subdivision since the reforms of Peter the Great. These were governed by a Governor and Governor- general respectively. A special case was the Chinese Eastern Railway Zone, which was governed as a concession granted by Imperial China to the Russian 'Chinese Eastern Railway Society' (in Russian Obshchestvo Kitayskoy Vostochnoy Zheleznoy Dorogi; established on 17 December 1896 in St. Petersburg, later moved to Vladivostok), which built 1,481 km of tracks (Tarskaya ‚Äì Hilar ‚Äì Harbin ‚Äì Nikolsk-Ussuriski; 3 November 1901 traffic opened) and established on 16 May 1898 the new capital city, Harbin; in August 1898, the defense for Chinese Eastern Railway (CER) across northeast China was assumed by Russia (first under Priamur governor). On July 1, 1903, the Chinese Eastern Railway was opened and given authority of its own CER Administration (Russian: Upravleniye KVZhD), vested in the Directors of the Chinese Eastern Railway, with the additional quality of Governors of the Chinese Eastern Railway Zone (in Harbin; as such being August 12, 1903 ‚Äì July 1, 1905 subordinated to the imperial Viceroyalty of the Far East, see L√ºshunkou). The post continued to function despite various political changes until after World War II. Some of the administrative subdivisions of Russia are headed by governors, while others are headed by Presidents or heads of administration. From 1991 to 2005, they were elected by popular vote and from 2005 to 2012, they were appointed by the federal president and confirmed by the province's legislature. After the debate, conducted by State Duma in April 2012, the direct elections of governors were expected to be restored. Other European countries and empires Austria A Landeshauptmann (German for \\"state captain\\" or \\"state governor\\", literally 'country headman'; plural Landeshauptleute or Landeshauptm√§nner as in Styria till 1861; Landeshauptfrau is the female form) is an official title in German for certain political offices equivalent to a Governor. It has historical uses, both administrative and colonial, and is now used in federal Austria and in South Tyrol, a majority German-speaking province of Italy adjacent to Tyrol. Benelux monarchies * In the Netherlands, the government-appointed heads of the provinces were known as Gouverneur from 1814 until 1850, when their title was changed to King's (or Queen's) Commissioner. In the southern province of Limburg, however, the commissioner is still informally called Governor. * In the Dutch crown's Caribbean Overseas territories (Aruba, Cura√ßao and Sint Maarten), the style Governor is still used, alongside the political head of government. * In Belgium, each of the ten provinces has a Governor, appointed by the regional government. He represents not only the regional, but also the federal government in the province. He controls the local governments and is responsible for law and order, security and emergency action. The national capital of Brussels, which is not part of a province, also has a governor with nearly the same competences. France During the Ancien R√©gime in France, the representative of the king in his provinces and cities was the \\"gouverneur\\". Royal officers chosen from the highest nobility, provincial and city governors (oversight of provinces and cities was frequently combined) were predominantly military positions in charge of defense and policing. Provincial governorsalso called \\"Lieutenant Generals\\"also had the ability of convoking provincial parlements, provincial estates and municipal bodies. The title \\"gouverneur\\" first appeared under Charles VI. The ordinance of Blois of 1579 reduced their number to 12, but an ordinance of 1779 increased their number to 39 (18 first-class governors, 21 second-class governors). Although in principle, they were the king's representatives and their charges could be revoked at the king's will, some governors had installed themselves and their heirs as a provincial dynasty. The governors were at the height of their power from the middle of the 16th to the middle of the 17th century, but their role in provincial unrest during the civil wars led Cardinal Richelieu to create the more tractable positions of intendants of finance, policing and justice, and in the 18th century the role of provincial governors was greatly curtailed. Germany Until 1933, the term Landeshauptmann (state governor) was used in Prussia for the head of government of a province,Duden; Definition of Landeshauptmann, in German. In the modern-day states of Germany, the counterpart to Landeshauptmann is the Ministerpr√§sident (minister-president). In the present German states of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Bavaria, Hesse, and North Rhine-Westphalia there are ‚Äì and earlier in more German states there were ‚Äì sub-state administrative regions called in , which is sometimes translated into English as governorate. Thus its respective head, in , is also translated as governor. Greece Ioannis Kapodistrias was the first (and, with the exception of the short tenure of his younger brother Augustinos Kapodistrias, the only) head of state of Greece to bear the title of governor. Italy *The essentially maritime empire of the Venetian republic, comprising Terra Firma, other Adriatic (mainly Istria and Dalmatia) and further Mediterranean (mainly Greek) possessions, used different styles, such as (castelleno e) provveditore (generale) or baile. *In the fascist regime there was the governor of the colonies of the Italian colonial empire. *In today's Italy, the official name of a head of a Regione (the Italian subnational entity) is Presidente della Giunta regionale (President of the regional executive council), but since 2000, when a constitutional reform decided the direct election of the president by the people, it has been usual to call him/her governatore/governatrice (governor). *In the various Italian provinces (former principalities and city-states) that became amalgamated as the Papal States, the Holy See exerted temporal power via its Legates and Delegates, including some Cardinals *Also in Avignon and the surrounding southern French Comtat Venaissin, the home of the Popes during their 'Babylonian exile', and retained centuries after, but never incorporated into the Papal States, Legates and Vice-legates were appointed. *The sovereign modern remnant of the formerly large Papal States, the tiny Vatican City State, is now a mere enclave in Rome, the capital of Italian Republic. As it is too small to have further administrative territorial divisions, it is the equivalent of a Prime Minister, Governor and Mayor all rolled into one post, styled the Governor of Vatican City. Other modern Asian countries China In the People's Republic of China, the title \\"Governor\\" () refers to the highest ranking executive of a provincial government. The Governor is usually placed second in the provincial power hierarchy, below the Secretary of the provincial Communist Party of China (CPC) committee (ÁúÅÂßî‰π¶ËÆ∞), who serves as the highest ranking Party official in the province. Governors are elected by the provincial congresses and approved by the provincial party chief. All governors are not locals in the provinces which they govern. The title can be also used while referring to a County Governor (ÂéøÈïø). =India= In India, each state has a ceremonial Governor appointed by the President of India. These Governors are different from the Governors who controlled the British- controlled portions of the Indian Empire (as opposed to the princely states) prior to 1947. A Governor is the head of a state in India. Generally, a Governor is appointed for each state, but after the 7th Constitutional Amendment, 1956, one Governor can be appointed for more than one state. =Malaysia= In Malaysia, each of the four non-monarchical states (Penang, Malacca, Sabah and Sarawak) has a ceremonial Governor styled Yang di-Pertua Negeri, appointed to a renewable four-year term by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the federal King of Malaysia on the advice of the Prime Minister after consulting the state governments. Each of these states has a separate head of government called the Ketua Menteri or Chief Minister. The four Yang di-Pertua Negeri are members of the Conference of Rulers, however they cannot participate in the election of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, discussions related to the privileges of the Malay rulers and matters concerning the observance of Islam. =Pakistan= In Pakistan, each of the four provinces has a Governor who is appointed by the President. The governor is the representative of the president in their province and is the ceremonial head of the province whereas the chief minister is the head of the provincial government. The governor exercises powers similar to the president's, in their respective province. =Papua New Guinea= In Papua New Guinea, the leaders of the provinces have been known as governors since August 1995. Previously they were called premiers. =Sri Lanka= The provincial councils of the 9 provinces of Sri Lanka are headed by governors, as representatives of the President. Prior to 1948, in Ceylon (former name for Sri Lanka), the Governor of Ceylon was the head of the British Colony. Indonesia In Indonesia, the title gubernur refers to the highest ranking executive of a provincial government. The Governor and the Vice Governor are elected by a direct vote from the people as a couple, so the Governor is responsible to the provincial residents. The governor has a term of five years to work in office and can be re-elected for another single period. In case of death, disability, or resignation, the vice governor would stand in as acting governor for some time before being inaugurated as the permanent governor. The elected Governor is inaugurated by the president, or by the Indonesian minister of home affairs on behalf of the president. In addition, the governor is the representative of central government in the province, and is responsible to the president. The governor's authority is regulated within the Law () Number 32/2004 and the Governmental Ordinance () Number 19/2010. Principally, the governor has the tasks and the authorities to lead governmental services in the province, based upon the policies that have been made together with the Provincial Parliament. The governor is not the superordinate of regents or mayors, but he/she is only to guide, supervise, and coordinate the works of city/municipal and regency governments. In other parts, municipal and regency governments have the rights to manage each governance affairs based on autonomy principle and assistantship duties. Japan In Japan, the title refers to the highest ranking executive of a Prefectural Government. The Governor is elected by a direct vote from the people and had a fixed term of four years. There is no restriction on the number of terms a person may serve as governor. The governor holds considerable power within the prefecture, including the ability to veto ordinances that have been passed by the prefecture assembly, as well as control of the prefecture's budget and the power to dissolve the prefecture assembly. The governor can be subjected to a recall referendum. A total of one to four vice governors are appointed by the governor with the approval of the assembly. In the case of the governor's death, disability, or resignation, a vice governor would stand in as governor or acting governor. See List of governors of Japan for a list of the current governors. Philippines During both the Spanish and American colonial periods, as well as during the Japanese Occupation of World War II, the chief executive of the colony was called the Governor-General of the Philippines. In the Republic of the Philippines, the title \\"Governor\\" (Gobernador or Punong Lalawigan in Filipino), refers to the highest ranking executive of a Philippine province. The governor is elected by a direct vote from the people and has a fixed term of three years. A governor can serve only up to a maximum of three consecutive terms. He may however be suspended by either the Ombudsman or the President, through the Secretary of Department of Interior and Local Government. He may be removed by the President if found guilty of an administrative case or a criminal act during his tenure. He may be subjected to a recall vote, but unlike a referendum, the voters elect the governor of their choice. In case of death, disability, resignation, forced removal or suspension, vice governor, elected separately in the same election for governor, succeeds as governor, or acting governor, as the case may be. In the Autonomous Region on Muslim Mindanao, a Regional Governor and Regional Vice Governor are elected by a block vote similar to the United States President. Thailand In Thailand, the title \\"Governor\\" (‡∏ú‡∏π‡πâ‡∏ß‡πà‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ä‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£ Phuwa Ratcha Gaan in Thai) refers to the administrator of each Thai province, who is appointed by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The only exception is the specially governed district of Bangkok, whose governor is elected by its population, thus making him or her equivalent to a mayor. Other modern countries in North America United States In the United States, the title \\"Governor\\" refers to the chief executive of each state or insular territory. Governors retain sovereign police power, are not subordinate to the federal authorities except by laws provided by the enumerated powers section of the federal constitution, and serve as the political and ceremonial head of the state. Nearly three-fourths of the states (36) hold gubernatorial elections in the same years as midterm elections (2 years off set from presidential elections). Eleven states hold them in the same years as presidential elections (Vermont and New Hampshire hold elections every two years in every even numbered year), while the remaining five hold them in odd numbered years (two in the year after a presidential election, three in the year before). In colonial North America, governors were chosen in a variety of ways, depending on how the colony was organized. In the crown colonies of Great Britain, France, and Spain, the governor was chosen by the ruling monarch of the colonizing power, or his designees; in British colonies, the Board of Trade was often the primary decision maker. Colonies based on a corporate charter, such as the Connecticut Colony and the Massachusetts Bay Colony, elected their own governors based on rules spelled out in the charter or other colonial legislation. In proprietary colonies, such as the Province of Carolina before it became a crown colony (and was divided into North and South), governors were chosen by the Lords Proprietor who controlled the colony. In the early years of the American Revolutionary War, eleven of the Thirteen Colonies evicted (with varying levels of violence) royal and proprietary governors. The other two colonies (Connecticut and Rhode Island) had corporate charters; Connecticut Governor Jonathan Trumbull was governor before and during the war period, while in Rhode Island, Governor Joseph Wanton was removed from office in 1775 for failing to support the rebel war effort. Before achieving statehood, many of the fifty states were territories. Administered by the federal government, they had governors who were appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate rather than elected by the resident population. Mexico In Mexico, governor refers to the elected chief and head of each of the nation's thirty one Free and Sovereign States with the official Spanish title being Gobernador. Mexican governors are directly elected by the citizens of each state for a six-year term and cannot be re-elected. Other modern countries in South America Many of the South American republics (such as Chile and Argentina) have provinces or states run by elected governors, with offices similar in nature to U.S. state governors. Brazil Until the 1930 Revolution, the heads of the Brazilian Provinces, now called States, were styled as (provincial/state) presidents (presidentes). From 1930 to 1945, they were styled either governors (governadores) or, when appointed by the federal government, intervenors (interventores). From 1945 on, they have only been called governors.

It is a white odorless solid, soluble in water and several organic solvents. It is produced industrially as a precursor to polyacrylamides, which find many uses as water-soluble thickeners and flocculation agents. It is highly toxic, likely to be carcinogenic, and partly for that reason it is mainly handled as an aqueous solution. The discovery in 2002 that some cooked foods contain acrylamide attracted significant attention to its possible biological effects. , epidemiological studies suggest it is unlikely that dietary acrylamide consumption increases people's risk of developing cancer despite it being a probable carcinogen according to IARC, NTP, and the EPA. Production Acrylamide can be prepared by the hydrolysis of acrylonitrile. The reaction is catalyzed by sulfuric acid as well as various metal salts. It is also catalyzed by the enzyme nitrile hydratase. US demand for acrylamide was as of 2007, increased from in 2006. N-(D-glucos-1-yl)-L-asparagine, precursor to acrylamide in cooked food. Acrylamide arises in some cooked foods via a series of steps initiated by the condensation of the amino acid asparagine and glucose. This condensation, one of the Maillard reactions followed by dehydrogenation produces N-(D-glucos-1-yl)-L-asparagine, which upon pyrolysis generates some acrylamide. Uses The majority of acrylamide is used to manufacture various polymers, especially polyacrylamide used as a thickening agent and in water treatment.  Toxicity and carcinogenicity  U.S. regulation Acrylamide is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to- Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities. Acrylamide is considered a potential occupational carcinogen by U.S. government agencies and classified as a Group 2A carcinogen by the IARC. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have set dermal occupational exposure limits at 0.03 mg/m3 over an eight-hour workday. In animal models, exposure to acrylamide causes tumors in the adrenal glands, thyroid, lungs, and testes. Acrylamide is easily absorbed by the skin and distributed throughout the organism; the highest levels of acrylamide post-exposure are found in the blood, non-exposed skin, kidneys, liver, testes, and spleen. Acrylamide can be metabolically-activated by cytochrome P450 to a genotoxic metabolite, glycidamide, which is considered to be a critical mode of action to the carcinogenesis of acrylamide. On the other hand, acrylamide and glycidamide can be detoxified via conjugation with glutathione to form acrylamide- and isomeric glycidamide-glutathione conjugates, subsequently metabolized to mercapturic acids and excreted in urine. Acrylamide has also been found to have neurotoxic effects in humans who have been exposed. Animal studies show neurotoxic effects as well as mutations in sperm. Hazards Acrylamide is also a skin irritant and may be a tumor initiator in the skin, potentially increasing risk for skin cancer. Symptoms of acrylamide exposure include dermatitis in the exposed area, and peripheral neuropathy. Laboratory research has found that some phytochemicals may have the potential to be developed into drugs which could alleviate the toxicity of acrylamide. Occurrence in food and associated health risks Discovery of acrylamide in foods Hot french fries are heated to a high temperature. Acrylamide was discovered in foods in April 2002 by Eritrean scientist Eden Tareke in Sweden; she found the chemical in starchy foods such as potato chips (potato crisps), French fries (chips), and bread that had been heated higher than . Production of acrylamide in the heating process was shown to be temperature-dependent. It was not found in food that had been boiled, or in foods that were not heated. Acrylamide has been found in roasted barley tea, called mugicha in Japanese. The barley is roasted so it is dark brown prior to being steeped in hot water. The roasting process produced 200‚Äì600 micrograms/kg of acrylamide in mugicha. This is less than the >1000 micrograms/kg found in potato crisps and other fried whole potato snack foods cited in the same study and it is unclear how much of this is ingested after the drink is prepared. Rice cracker and sweet potato levels were lower than in potatoes. Potatoes cooked whole were found to have significantly lower acrylamide levels than the others, suggesting a link between food preparation method and acrylamide levels. Acrylamide levels appear to rise as food is heated for longer periods of time. Although researchers are still unsure of the precise mechanisms by which acrylamide forms in foods, many believe it is a byproduct of the Maillard reaction. In fried or baked goods, acrylamide may be produced by the reaction between asparagine and reducing sugars (fructose, glucose, etc.) or reactive carbonyls at temperatures above . Later studies have found acrylamide in black olives,\\"Acrylamide detected in prune juice and olives\\" Food Safety & Quality Control Newsletter 26 March 2004, William Reed Business Media SAS, citing \\"Survey Data on Acrylamide in Food: Total Diet Study Results\\" United States Food and Drug Administration February 2004; later updated in June 2005, July 2006, and October 2006 dried plums, dried pears, coffee,Top Eight Foods by Acrylamide Per Portion . p. 17. jifsan.umd.edu (2004).

Retrieved on 2012-06-11. According to the EFSA, the main toxicity risks of acrylamide are \\"Neurotoxicity, adverse effects on male reproduction, developmental toxicity and carcinogenicity\\". However, according to their research, there is no concern on non-neoplastic effects. Furthermore, while the relation between consumption of acrylamide and cancer in rats and mice has been shown, it is still unclear whether acrylamide consumption has an effect on the risk of developing cancer in humans, and existing epidemiological studies in humans are very limited and do not show any relation between acrylamide and cancer in humans. Food industry workers exposed to twice the average level of acrylamide do not exhibit higher cancer rates. Acceptable limits Although acrylamide has known toxic effects on the nervous system and on fertility, a June 2002 report by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Health Organization attempting to establish basic toxicology (threshold limit value, no-observed-adverse-effect levels, tolerable daily intake, etc.) concluded the intake level required to observe neuropathy (0.5 mg/kg body weight/day) was 500 times higher than the average dietary intake of acrylamide (1 Œºg/kg body weight/day). For effects on fertility, the level is 2,000 times higher than the average intake.FAO/WHO Consultation on the Health Implications of Acrylamide in Food; Geneva, 25‚Äì27 June 2002, Summary Report. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2014-11-09. From this, they concluded acrylamide levels in food were safe in terms of neuropathy, but raised concerns over human carcinogenicity based on known carcinogenicity in laboratory animals. Opinions of health organizations The American Cancer Society say that laboratory studies have shown that acrylamide is likely to be a carcinogen, but that evidence from epidemiological studies suggest that dietary acrylamide is unlikely to raise the risk of people developing cancer. The World Health Organization (WHO) has set up a clearinghouse for information about acrylamide that includes a database of researchers and data providers; references for research published elsewhere; information updates about the current status of research efforts; and updates on information relevant to the health risk of acrylamide in food. =HEATOX (heat-generated food toxicants) study in Europe= The Heat- generated Food Toxicants (HEATOX) Project was a European Commission-funded multidisciplinary research project running from late 2003 to early 2007. Its objectives were to \\"estimate health risks that may be associated with hazardous compounds in heat-treated food, [and to] find cooking/processing methods that minimize the amounts of these compounds, thereby providing safe, nutritious, and high-quality food-stuffs.\\"Heat-generated Food Toxicants; Identification, Characterisation and Risk Minimisation.

It found that \\"the evidence of acrylamide posing a cancer risk for humans has been strengthened,\\"HEATOX project completed ‚Äì brings new pieces to the Acrylamide Puzzle. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2012-06-11. and that \\"compared with many regulated food carcinogens, the exposure to acrylamide poses a higher estimated risk to European consumers.\\" HEATOX sought also to provide consumers with advice on how to lower their intake of acrylamide, specifically pointing out that home-cooked food tends to contribute far less to overall acrylamide levels than food that was industrially prepared, and that avoiding overcooking is one of the best ways to minimize exposure at home. Public awareness On April 24, 2002, the Swedish National Food Administration announced that acrylamide can be found in baked and fried starchy foods, such as potato chips, breads, and cookies. Concern was raised mainly because of the probable carcinogenic effects of acrylamide. This was followed by a strong, but short- lived, interest from the press. On August 26, 2005, California attorney general Bill Lockyer filed a lawsuit against four makers of french fries and potato chips ‚Äì H.J. Heinz Co., Frito-Lay, Kettle Foods Inc., and Lance Inc. ‚Äì to reduce the risk to consumers from consuming acrylamide.Attorney General Lockyer Files Lawsuit to Require Consumer Warnings About Cancer-Causing Chemical in Potato Chips and French Fries , Office of the attorney general, State of California, Department of justice The lawsuit was settled on August 1, 2008, with the food producers agreeing to cut acrylamide levels to 275 parts per billion in three years, to avoid a Proposition 65 warning label. The companies avoided trial by agreeing to pay a combined $3 million in fines as a settlement with the California attorney general's office. In 2016, the UK Food Standards Agency launched a campaign called \\"Go for Gold\\", warning of the possible cancer risk associated with cooking potatoes and other starchy foods at high temperatures. In 2018, a judge in California ruled that the coffee industry had not provided sufficient evidence that acrylamide contents in coffee were at safe enough levels to not require a Proposition 65 warning. Occurrence in cigarettes Cigarette smoking is a major acrylamide source. It has been shown in one study to cause an increase in blood acrylamide levels three-fold greater than any dietary factor.

A second in command to a premier is designated as a vice-premier or deputy premier. Examples by country The word comes from french \\"Premier ministre\\" which means prime minister. \\"Premier\\" meaning \\"first\\", coming from Latin prƒ´mƒÅrius. This is why in many nations, \\"premier\\" is used interchangeably with \\"prime minister\\". In the People's Republic of China, \\"premier\\" is more common and official, but \\"prime minister\\" is still used (see Premier of the People's Republic of China). In five of the British overseas territories (Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Montserrat, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the British Virgin Islands), the elected heads of government are styled as \\"Premier\\". In other overseas territories the equivalent post is styled as Chief Minister. \\"Premier\\" is also the title of the heads of government in sub-national entities, such as the provinces and territories of Canada, states of the Commonwealth of Australia, provinces of South Africa, the island of Nevis within the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis, and the nation of Niue. In some of these cases, the formal title remains \\"Prime Minister\\" but \\"Premier\\" is used to avoid confusion with the national leader. In these cases, care should be taken not to confuse the title of \\"premier\\" with \\"prime minister\\". In these countries, terms such as \\"Federal Premier\\", \\"National Premier\\" or \\"Premier of the Dominion\\" were sometimes used to refer to prime ministers, although these are now obsolete. In Cambodia, \\"Premier\\" means the \\"Prime Minister\\". In the Czech Republic, \\"Premi√©r\\" means the \\"Prime Minister\\" and the Czech language translates both \\"Premier\\" and \\"Prime Minister\\" as \\"Premi√©r\\". In Croatia, the head of government is officially called \\"President of the Government\\" (predsjednik vlade) but \\"Premier\\" (premijer) is colloquially used. In Serbia, the head of government is officially called \\"President of the Government\\" (predsednik vlade) but \\"Premier\\" (premijer) is colloquially used. In Italy, the President of the Council of Ministers, an office equivalent to prime minister, is informally referred to as the \\"Premier\\". In North Macedonia the head of the government is named premier (Macedonian –ø—Ä–µ–º–∏–µ—Ä, premier), usually translated in English as prime minister. A premier will normally be a head of government, but is not usually the head of state. In presidential systems, the two roles are often combined into one, whereas in parliamentary systems of government the two are usually kept separate. An example of nations that have separate roles for the premier/prime minister and the president are the Fifth French Republic, South Korea and China. In the Soviet Union, the title of premier was applied to the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars (Renamed Council of Ministers of the USSR in 1946) who acted as the Soviet Union's Premier.

Playing the role of a psychopomp, she would accompany such suicides to heaven. No certain depictions of Ixtab are known. Sources The only description of the goddess occurs in the so-called Relaci√≥n of the 16th- century Spanish inquisitor Diego de Landa:Tozzer 1941: 132, slightly adapted Beyond this description, there is only a very brief and somewhat obscure mention of Ix Tab in the Book of Chilam Balam of Tizimin and in the P√©rez Codex, in a context of chaos, suffering, and hangings: \\"They suspended Ix Tab from their hands\\", or, alternatively, \\"Ix Tab suspended them from her hands\\".Reyes-Foster and Kangas 2016: 9 Comparisons Ix Tab is the female form of ah tab, \\"hangman\\".Ciudad Real 2001: 55 The function of Ix Tab as a benevolent \\"hangwoman\\" could derive from a basic association with snares.cf. Reyes-Foster and Kangas 2016: 19-20 Landa (Tozzer 1941: 155) mentions the hunting deity [Ah] Tabay (\\"Ensnarer\\" or \\"Deceiver\\"), possibly a patron of hunting with snares, including such that hoist the prey into the air. Animals hoisted by such snares are found depicted in the Dresden and Madrid codices, the Madrid codex (MC45c) personifying one of these traps by a male hunting deity. Ix Tab could be understood as a specialized, female form of such a deity, dlring the human quarry into the hanging rope personified by her. Suicides freely putting their heads into this \\"snare\\" (prompted, perhaps, by a dream) could then be seen to consecrate themselves to her. On the other hand, the Xtabay of contemporary folklore is a seductive female demon \\"ensnaring\\" or \\"deceiving\\" her male human preys so as to madden and destroy them.Thompson 1970: 309 Dresden Codex The image from the Dresden Codex thought to represent Ixtab. The Dresden Codex picture (DC53b) of a dead woman with a rope around the neck, suspended from a celestial bar, is often, and without further proof, taken to represent Ix Tab. However, since the picture occurs in a section devoted to eclipses of sun and moon,Thompson 1972: 71-77 it may rather have been used to symbolize a lunar eclipse and its dire consequences for women, who were intimately associated with the moon goddess. As possible fabrication It has been claimed that the Pre-Spanish Maya did not have a suicide goddess, or a significant narrative of suicide by hanging.Reyes-Foster and Kangas 2016 Originally, Ix Tab may only have been a hunting goddess (see above, Comparisons).Reyes-Foster and Kangas 2016: 19 Today, the sensationalist idea of a \\"cult of Ix Tab\\" appears to be invoked by popular Yucatecan media to portray suicide as an indigenous problem, given that Yucat√°n has a suicide rate more than twice that of Mexico at large.Reyes-Foster and Kangas 2020: 5-6 See also *Death deity *Fakelore *Religious views on suicide References Bibliography *Ciudad Real, Antonio de, Calepino maya de Motul.

He wrote on philosophy, political theory, sociology, history and linguistics. He was a founding member and one-time leader of the Communist Party of Italy and was imprisoned by Benito Mussolini's Fascist regime. Gramsci wrote more than 30 notebooks and 3,000 pages of history and analysis during his imprisonment. His Prison Notebooks are considered a highly original contribution to 20th-century political theory. Gramsci drew insights from varying sources ‚Äì not only other Marxists but also thinkers such as Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, Vilfredo Pareto, Georges Sorel and Benedetto Croce. The notebooks cover a wide range of topics, including Italian history and nationalism, the French Revolution, fascism, Taylorism and Fordism, civil society, folklore, religion and high and popular culture. Gramsci is best known for his theory of cultural hegemony, which describes how the state and ruling capitalist class ‚Äì the bourgeoisie ‚Äì use cultural institutions to maintain power in capitalist societies. The bourgeoisie, in Gramsci's view, develops a hegemonic culture using ideology rather than violence, economic force, or coercion. Hegemonic culture propagates its own values and norms so that they become the \\"common sense\\" values of all and thus maintain the status quo. Cultural hegemony is therefore used to maintain consent to the capitalist order, rather than the use of force to maintain order. This cultural hegemony is produced and reproduced by the dominant class through the institutions that form the superstructure. Gramsci also attempted to break from the economic determinism of traditional Marxist thought, and so is sometimes described as a neo-Marxist. He held a humanistic understanding of Marxism, seeing it as a \\"philosophy of praxis\\" and an \\"absolute historicism\\" that transcends traditional materialism and traditional idealism. Life  Early life  GramsciAtto di nascita di Gramsci Antonio Francesco was born in Ales, in the province of Oristano, on the island of Sardinia, the fourth of seven sons of Francesco Gramsci (1860‚Äì1937) and Giuseppina Marcias (1861‚Äì1932). The senior Gramsci was a low-level official born in the small town of Gaeta, in the province of Latina (in the Central Italian region of Lazio), to a well-off family from the Southern Italian regions of Campania and Calabria and of Arb√´resh√´ (Italo-Albanian) descent. Antonio Gramsci himself believed his father's family had left Albania as recently as 1821. \\"I myself have no race. My father is of recent Albanian origin. The family escaped from Epirus after or during the 1821 wars and Italianized itself rapidly.\\" Lettere dal carcere (Letters from Prison), ed. S. Capriogloi & E Fubini (Einaudi, Turin, 1965), pp. 507‚Äì08.\\"International Gramsci SocietyGenealogia dei Gramsci The Albanian origin of his father's family is attested in the surname Gramsci, an Italianized form of Gramshi, that stems from the definite noun of the placename Gramsh, a small town in central-eastern Albania. \\"Antonio Gramsci, nato ad Ales (Oristano) nel 1891, fondatore del Partito Comunista d'ltalia nel 1921, arrestato nel 1926, morto a Roma nel 1937, portava nel proprio cognome la manifesta origine albanese della famiglia (Gramsh o Gramshi, con l'articolo determinativo finale in -i, √® il nome di una cittadina dell'Albania centrale).\\" The mother of Antonio Gramsci belonged to a Sardinian landowning family from Sorgono (in the province of Nuoro). The senior Gramsci's financial difficulties and troubles with the police forced the family to move about through several villages in Sardinia until they finally settled in Ghilarza.Gramsci 1971, p. xviii. In 1898, Francesco was convicted of embezzlement and imprisoned, reducing his family to destitution. The young Antonio had to abandon schooling and work at various casual jobs until his father's release in 1904.Gramsci 1971, pp. xviii‚Äìxix. As a boy, Gramsci suffered from health problems, particularly a malformation of the spine that stunted his growth (his adult height was less than 5 feet)Crehan, Kate (2002). Gramsci, Culture, and Anthropology. University of California Press. p. 14. . and left him seriously hunchbacked. For decades, it was reported that his condition had been due to a childhood accident‚Äîspecifically, having been dropped by a nanny‚Äîbut more recently it has been suggested that it was due to Pott disease,Markowicz, Daniel M. (2011) \\"Gramsci, Antonio,\\" in The Encyclopedia of Literary and Cultural Theory, ed. Michael Ryan, a form of tuberculosis that can cause deformity of the spine. Gramsci was also plagued by various internal disorders throughout his life. Gramsci completed secondary school in Cagliari, where he lodged with his elder brother Gennaro, a former soldier whose time on the mainland had made him a militant socialist. However, Gramsci's sympathies then did not lie with socialism, but rather with the grievances of impoverished Sardinian peasants and miners, whose mistreatment by the mainlanders would later deeply contribute to his intellectual growth.Gramsci 1971, p. xix.Antonio Gramsci, Dizionario di Storia Treccani.

Turin University of Turin: the Rectorate In 1911 Gramsci won a scholarship to study at the University of Turin, sitting the exam at the same time as Palmiro Togliatti.Gramsci 1971, p. xx. At Turin he read literature and took a keen interest in linguistics, which he studied under Matteo Bartoli. Gramsci was in Turin as it was going through industrialization, with the Fiat and Lancia factories recruiting workers from poorer regions. Trade unions became established, and the first industrial social conflicts started to emerge.Gramsci 1971, p. xxv. Gramsci frequented socialist circles as well as associating with Sardinian emigrants on the Italian mainland. Both his earlier experiences in Sardinia and his environment on the mainland shaped his worldview. Gramsci joined the Italian Socialist Party in late 1913, where he would later occupy a key position and observe from Turin the Russian revolutionary process. Although showing a talent for his studies, Gramsci had financial problems and poor health. Together with his growing political commitment, these led to him abandoning his education in early 1915, at age 24. By this time he had acquired an extensive knowledge of history and philosophy. At university, he had come into contact with the thought of Antonio Labriola, Rodolfo Mondolfo, Giovanni Gentile, and most importantly, Benedetto Croce, possibly the most widely-respected Italian intellectual of his day. Labriola especially propounded a brand of Hegelian Marxism that he labelled \\"philosophy of praxis\\".Gramsci 1971, p. xxi. Although Gramsci later used this phrase to escape the prison censors, his relationship with this current of thought was ambiguous throughout his life. From 1914 onward, Gramsci's writings for socialist newspapers such as Il Grido del Popolo () earned him a reputation as a notable journalist. In 1916 he became co-editor of the Piedmont edition of Avanti!, the Socialist Party official organ. An articulate and prolific writer of political theory, Gramsci proved a formidable commentator, writing on all aspects of Turin's social and political events.Gramsci 1971, p. xxx. Gramsci was at this time also involved in the education and organisation of Turin workers; he spoke in public for the first time in 1916 and gave talks on topics such as Romain Rolland, the French Revolution, the Paris Commune, and the emancipation of women. In the wake of the arrest of Socialist Party leaders that followed revolutionary riots in August 1917, Gramsci became one of Turin's leading socialists; he was elected to the party's Provisional Committee and also made editor of Il Grido del Popolo.Gramsci 1971, pp. xxx‚Äìxxxi. In April 1919, with Togliatti, Angelo Tasca and Umberto Terracini, Gramsci set up the weekly newspaper L'Ordine Nuovo (The New Order). In October the same year, despite being divided into various hostile factions, the Socialist Party moved by a large majority to join the Third International. Vladimir Lenin saw the L'Ordine Nuovo group as closest in orientation to the Bolsheviks, and it received his backing against the anti- parliamentary programme of the left-communist Amadeo Bordiga. In the course of tactical debates within the party, Gramsci's group mainly stood out due to its advocacy of workers' councils, which had come into existence in Turin spontaneously during the large strikes of 1919 and 1920. For Gramsci, these councils were the proper means of enabling workers to take control of the task of organising production. Although he believed his position at this time to be in keeping with Lenin's policy of \\"All power to the Soviets\\", his stance that these Italian councils were communist, rather than just one organ of political struggle against the bourgeoisie, was attacked by Bordiga for betraying a syndicalist tendency influenced by the thought of Georges Sorel and Daniel DeLeon. By the time of the defeat of the Turin workers in spring 1920, Gramsci was almost alone in his defence of the councils. In the Communist Party of Italy Julia Schucht with sons The failure of the workers' councils to develop into a national movement convinced Gramsci that a Communist Party in the Leninist sense was needed. The group around L'Ordine Nuovo declaimed incessantly against the Italian Socialist Party's centrist leadership and ultimately allied with Bordiga's far larger \\"abstentionist\\" faction. On 21 January 1921, in the town of Livorno (Leghorn), the Communist Party of Italy (Partito Comunista d'Italia ‚Äì PCI) was founded. In opposition to Bordiga, Gramsci supported the Arditi del Popolo, a militant anti-fascist group which struggled against the Blackshirts. Gramsci would be a leader of the party from its inception but was subordinate to Bordiga, whose emphasis on discipline, centralism and purity of principles dominated the party's programme until the latter lost the leadership in 1924. In 1922, Gramsci travelled to Russia as a representative of the new party. Here, he met Julia Schucht (Yulia Apollonovna Schucht), a young violinist whom he married in 1923 and with whom he had two sons, Delio (born 1924) and Giuliano (born 1926).Picture of Gramsci's wife and their two sons at the Italian-language Antonio Gramsci Website.

Antonio Gramsci commemorative plaque, left The Russian mission coincided with the advent of fascism in Italy, and Gramsci returned with instructions to foster, against the wishes of the PCI leadership, a united front of leftist parties against fascism. Such a front would ideally have had the PCI at its centre, through which Moscow would have controlled all the leftist forces, but others disputed this potential supremacy: socialists did have a certain tradition in Italy, too, while the Communist Party seemed relatively young and too radical. Many believed that an eventual coalition led by communists would have functioned too remotely from political debate, and thus would have run the risk of isolation. In late 1922 and early 1923, Benito Mussolini's government embarked on a campaign of repression against the opposition parties, arresting most of the PCI leadership, including Bordiga. At the end of 1923, Gramsci travelled from Moscow to Vienna, where he tried to revive a party torn by factional strife. In 1924 Gramsci, now recognised as head of the PCI, gained election as a deputy for the Veneto. He started organizing the launch of the official newspaper of the party, called L'Unit√† (Unity), living in Rome while his family stayed in Moscow. At its Lyon Congress in January 1926, Gramsci's theses calling for a united front to restore democracy to Italy were adopted by the party. In 1926, Joseph Stalin's manoeuvres inside the Bolshevik party moved Gramsci to write a letter to the Comintern in which he deplored the opposition led by Leon Trotsky but also underlined some presumed faults of the leader. Togliatti, in Moscow as a representative of the party, received the letter, opened it, read it, and decided not to deliver it. This caused a difficult conflict between Gramsci and Togliatti which they never completely resolved.Giuseppe Vacca.Vita e Pensieri Di Antonio Gramsci.Einaudi.Torino 2012 Imprisonment and death Cimitero Acattolico in Rome On 9 November 1926, the Fascist government enacted a new wave of emergency laws, taking as a pretext an alleged attempt on Mussolini's life that had occurred several days earlier. The fascist police arrested Gramsci, despite his parliamentary immunity, and brought him to the Roman prison Regina Coeli. At his trial, Gramsci's prosecutor stated, \\"For twenty years we must stop this brain from functioning\\".Gramsci 1971, p.lxxxix. He received an immediate sentence of five years in confinement on the island of Ustica and the following year he received a sentence of 20 years' imprisonment in Turi, near Bari. Over 11 years in prison, his health deteriorated: \\"His teeth fell out, his digestive system collapsed so that he could not eat solid food... he had convulsions when he vomited blood and suffered headaches so violent that he beat his head against the walls of his cell.\\"Gramsci 1971, p. xcii. An international campaign, organised by Piero Sraffa at Cambridge University and Gramsci's sister-in-law Tatiana, was mounted to demand Gramsci's release.Jones, S. Gramsci (Routledge Critical Thinkers), p.25. Routledge: 2006. In 1933 he was moved from the prison at Turi to a clinic at Formia,Gramsci 1971, p. xciii. but was still being denied adequate medical attention.Gramsci 1971, p. xciv. Two years later he was moved to the Quisisana clinic in Rome. He was due for release on 21 April 1937 and planned to retire to Sardinia for convalescence, but a combination of arteriosclerosis, pulmonary tuberculosis, high blood pressure, angina, gout and acute gastric disorders meant that he was too ill to move. Gramsci died on 27 April 1937, at the age of 46. His ashes are buried in the Cimitero Acattolico (Non-Catholic Cemetery) in Rome. Philosophical work Gramsci was one of the most important Marxist thinkers of the 20th century, and a particularly key thinker in the development of Western Marxism. He wrote more than 30 notebooks and 3,000 pages of history and analysis during his imprisonment. These writings, known as the Prison Notebooks, contain Gramsci's tracing of Italian history and nationalism, as well as some ideas in Marxist theory, critical theory and educational theory associated with his name, such as: *Cultural hegemony as a means of maintaining and legitimising the capitalist state *The need for popular workers' education to encourage development of intellectuals from the working class *An analysis of the modern capitalist state that distinguishes between political society, which dominates directly and coercively, and civil society, where leadership is constituted through consent *Absolute historicism *A critique of economic determinism that opposes fatalistic interpretations of Marxism *A critique of philosophical materialism Hegemony Hegemony was a term previously used by Russian Marxists such as Vladimir Lenin to denote the political leadership of the working-class in a democratic revolution. Gramsci greatly expanded this concept, developing an acute analysis of how the ruling capitalist class ‚Äì the bourgeoisie ‚Äì establishes and maintains its control. Orthodox Marxism had predicted that socialist revolution was inevitable in capitalist societies. By the early 20th century, no such revolution had occurred in the most advanced nations. Rather, capitalism seemed more entrenched than ever. Capitalism, Gramsci suggested, maintained control not just through violence and political and economic coercion, but also through ideology. The bourgeoisie developed a hegemonic culture, which propagated its own values and norms so that they became the \\"common sense\\" values of all. People in the working-class (and other classes) identified their own good with the good of the bourgeoisie and helped to maintain the status quo rather than revolting. To counter the notion that bourgeois values represented natural or normal values for society, the working class needed to develop a culture of its own. Lenin held that culture was ancillary to political objectives, but for Gramsci, it was fundamental to the attainment of power that cultural hegemony be achieved first. In Gramsci's view, a class cannot dominate in modern conditions by merely advancing its own narrow economic interests; neither can it dominate purely through force and coercion. Rather, it must exert intellectual and moral leadership, and make alliances and compromises with a variety of forces. Gramsci calls this union of social forces a \\"historic bloc\\", taking a term from Georges Sorel. This bloc forms the basis of consent to a certain social order, which produces and re-produces the hegemony of the dominant class through a nexus of institutions, social relations, and ideas. In this way, Gramsci's theory emphasized the importance of the political and ideological superstructure in both maintaining and fracturing relations of the economic base. Gramsci stated that bourgeois cultural values were tied to folklore, popular culture and religion, and therefore much of his analysis of hegemonic culture is aimed at these. He was also impressed by the influence Roman Catholicism had and the care the Church had taken to prevent an excessive gap developing between the religion of the learned and that of the less educated. Gramsci saw Marxism as a marriage of the purely intellectual critique of religion found in Renaissance humanism and the elements of the Reformation that had appealed to the masses. For Gramsci, Marxism could supersede religion only if it met people's spiritual needs, and to do so people would have to think of it as an expression of their own experience. Intellectuals and education Gramsci gave much thought to the role of intellectuals in society. He stated that all men are intellectuals, in that all have intellectual and rational faculties, but not all men have the social function of intellectuals.Gramsci 1982, p. 9. He saw modern intellectuals not as talkers, but as practically-minded directors and organisers who produced hegemony through ideological apparatuses such as education and the media. Furthermore, he distinguished between a traditional intelligentsia which sees itself (wrongly) as a class apart from society, and the thinking groups which every class produces from its own ranks \\"organically\\". Such \\"organic\\" intellectuals do not simply describe social life in accordance with scientific rules, but instead articulate, through the language of culture, the feelings and experiences which the masses could not express for themselves. To Gramsci, it was the duty of organic intellectuals to speak to the obscured precepts of folk wisdom, or common sense (senso comune), of their respective political spheres. These intellectuals would represent excluded social groups of a society, what Gramsci referred to as the subaltern. In line with Gramsci's theories of hegemonic power, he argued that capitalist power needed to be challenged by building a counter-hegemony. By this he meant that, as part of the war of position, the organic intellectuals and others within the working-class, need to develop alternative values and an alternative ideology in contrast to bourgeois ideology. He argued that the reason this had not needed to happen in Russia was because the Russian ruling class did not have genuine hegemonic power. So the Bolsheviks were able to see through a war of manoeuvre (the 1917 revolution), relatively easily, because ruling-class hegemony had never been fully achieved. He believed that a final war of manoeuvre was only possible, in the developed and advanced capitalist societies, when the war of position had been won by the organic intellectuals and the working-class building a counter-hegemony. The need to create a working-class culture and a counter-hegemony relates to Gramsci's call for a kind of education that could develop working-class intellectuals, whose task was not to introduce Marxist ideology into the consciousness of the proletariat as a set of foreign notions but to renovate the existing intellectual activity of the masses and make it natively critical of the status quo. His ideas about an education system for this purpose correspond with the notion of critical pedagogy and popular education as theorized and practised in later decades by Paulo Freire in Brazil, and have much in common with the thought of Frantz Fanon. For this reason, partisans of adult and popular education consider Gramsci an important voice to this day. State and civil society Gramsci's theory of hegemony is tied to his conception of the capitalist state. Gramsci does not understand the state in the narrow sense of the government. Instead, he divides it between political society (the police, the army, legal system, etc.) ‚Äì the arena of political institutions and legal constitutional control ‚Äì and civil society (the family, the education system, trade unions, etc.) ‚Äì commonly seen as the private or non- state sphere, which mediates between the state and the economy. However, he stresses that the division is purely conceptual and that the two often overlap in reality.Gramsci 1982, p. 160. Gramsci claims the capitalist state rules through force plus consent: political society is the realm of force and civil society is the realm of consent. Gramsci proffers that under modern capitalism the bourgeoisie can maintain its economic control by allowing certain demands made by trade unions and mass political parties within civil society to be met by the political sphere. Thus, the bourgeoisie engages in passive revolution by going beyond its immediate economic interests and allowing the forms of its hegemony to change. Gramsci posits that movements such as reformism and fascism, as well as the scientific management and assembly line methods of Frederick Taylor and Henry Ford respectively, are examples of this. Drawing from Machiavelli, he argues that The Modern Prince ‚Äì the revolutionary party ‚Äì is the force that will allow the working-class to develop organic intellectuals and an alternative hegemony within civil society. For Gramsci, the complex nature of modern civil society means that a war of position, carried out by revolutionaries through political agitation, the trade unions, advancement of proletarian culture, and other ways to create an opposing civil society was necessary alongside a war of manoeuvre ‚Äì a direct revolution ‚Äì in order to have a successful revolution without danger of a counter-revolution or degeneration. Despite his claim that the lines between the two may be blurred, Gramsci rejects the state-worship that results from equating political society with civil society, as was done by the Jacobins and Fascists. He believes the proletariat's historical task is to create a \\"regulated society\\", where political society is diminished and civil society is expanded. He defines the \\"withering away of the state\\" as the full development of civil society's ability to regulate itself. Historicism Like the early Marx, Gramsci was an emphatic proponent of historicism.Gramsci 1982, pp. 404‚Äì407. In Gramsci's view, all meaning derives from the relation between human practical activity (or praxis) and the objective historical and social processes of which it is a part. Ideas cannot be understood outside their social and historical context, apart from their function and origin. The concepts by which we organise our knowledge of the world do not derive primarily from our relation to objects, but rather from the social relations between the users of those concepts. As a result, there is no such thing as an unchanging human nature, but only historically variable social relationships. Furthermore, philosophy and science do not reflect a reality independent of man. Rather, a theory can be said to be true when, in any given historical situation, it expresses the real developmental trend of that situation. For the majority of Marxists, truth was truth no matter when and where it was known, and scientific knowledge (which included Marxism) accumulated historically as the advance of truth in this everyday sense. In this view, Marxism (or the Marxist theory of history and economics) did not belong to the illusory realm of the superstructure because it is a science. In contrast, Gramsci believed Marxism was true in a socially pragmatic sense: by articulating the class consciousness of the proletariat, Marxism expressed the truth of its times better than any other theory. This anti-scientistic and anti-positivist stance was indebted to the influence of Benedetto Croce. However, it should be underlined that Gramsci's absolute historicism broke with Croce's tendency to secure a metaphysical synthesis in historical destiny. Although Gramsci repudiates the charge, his historical account of truth has been criticised as a form of relativism. Critique of \\"economism\\" In a pre-prison article entitled \\"The Revolution against \\", Gramsci wrote that the October Revolution in Russia had invalidated the idea that socialist revolution had to await the full development of capitalist forces of production. This reflected his view that Marxism was not a determinist philosophy. The principle of the causal primacy of the forces of production was a misconception of Marxism. Both economic changes and cultural changes are expressions of a basic historical process, and it is difficult to say which sphere has primacy over the other. The belief from the earliest years of the workers' movement that it would inevitably triumph due to \\"historical laws\\" was a product of the historical circumstances of an oppressed class restricted mainly to defensive action. This fatalistic doctrine was to be abandoned as a hindrance once the working-class became able to take the initiative. Because Marxism is a philosophy of praxis, it cannot rely on unseen historical laws as the agents of social change. History is defined by human praxis and therefore includes a human will. Nonetheless, will-power cannot achieve anything it likes in any given situation: when the consciousness of the working-class reaches the stage of development necessary for action, it will encounter historical circumstances that cannot be arbitrarily altered. However, it is not predetermined by historical inevitability as to which of several possible developments will take place as a result. His critique of economism also extended to that practised by the syndicalists of the Italian trade unions. He believed that many trade unionists had settled for a reformist, gradualist approach in that they had refused to struggle on the political front in addition to the economic front. For Gramsci, much as the ruling class can look beyond its own immediate economic interests to reorganise the forms of its own hegemony, so must the working class present its own interests as congruous with the universal advancement of society. While Gramsci envisioned the trade unions as one organ of a counter-hegemonic force in a capitalist society, the trade union leaders simply saw these organizations as a means to improve conditions within the existing structure. Gramsci referred to the views of these trade unionists as vulgar economism, which he equated to covert reformism and even liberalism. Critique of materialism By virtue of his belief that human history and collective praxis determine whether any philosophical question is meaningful or not, Gramsci's views run contrary to the metaphysical materialism and copy theory of perception advanced by Friedrich Engels,Friedrich Engels: Anti- DuehringFriedrich Engels: Dialectics of Nature and Lenin,Lenin: Materialism and Empirio-Criticism. though he does not explicitly state this. For Gramsci, Marxism does not deal with a reality that exists in and for itself, independent of humanity.Gramsci 1982, pp. 440‚Äì448. The concept of an objective universe outside of human history and human praxis was analogous to belief in God.Gramsci 1982, p. 445. Gramsci defined objectivity in terms of a universal intersubjectivity to be established in a future communist society. Natural history was thus only meaningful in relation to human history. In his view philosophical materialism resulted from a lack of critical thought,Gramsci 1982, pp. 444‚Äì445. and could not be said to oppose religious dogma and superstition.Gramsci 1982, p. 420. Despite this, Gramsci resigned himself to the existence of this arguably cruder form of Marxism. Marxism was a philosophy for the proletariat, a subaltern class, and thus could often only be expressed in the form of popular superstition and common sense.Gramsci 1982, pp. 419‚Äì425. Nonetheless, it was necessary to effectively challenge the ideologies of the educated classes, and to do so Marxists must present their philosophy in a more sophisticated guise, and attempt to genuinely understand their opponents' views. Influence Gramsci's thought emanates from the organized left, but he has also become an important figure in current academic discussions within cultural studies and critical theory. Political theorists from the center and the right have also found insight in his concepts; his idea of hegemony, for example, has become widely cited. His influence is particularly strong in contemporary political science (see Neo-Gramscianism). His work also heavily influenced intellectual discourse on popular culture and scholarly popular culture studies in which many have found the potential for political or ideological resistance to dominant government and business interests. His critics charge him with fostering a notion of power struggle through ideas. They find the Gramscian approach to philosophical analysis, reflected in current academic controversies, to be in conflict with open- ended, liberal inquiry grounded in apolitical readings of the classics of Western culture. As a socialist, Gramsci's legacy has been disputed. Togliatti, who led the Party (renamed as Italian Communist Party, PCI) after World War II and whose gradualist approach was a forerunner to Eurocommunism, claimed that the PCI's practices during this period were congruent with Gramscian thought. It is speculated that he would likely have been expelled from his Party if his true views had been known, particularly his growing hostility to Stalin.

A Rite is a series of progressive degrees that are conferred by various Masonic organizations or bodies, each of which operates under the control of its own central authority. The York Rite specifically is a collection of separate Masonic Bodies and associated Degrees that would otherwise operate independently. The three primary bodies in the York Rite are the Chapter of Royal Arch Masons, Council of Royal & Select Masters or Council of Cryptic Masons, and the Commandery of Knights Templar, each of which are governed independently but are all considered to be a part of the York Rite. There are also other organizations that are considered to be directly associated with the York Rite, or require York Rite membership to join such as the York Rite Sovereign College but in general the York Rite is considered to be made up of the aforementioned three. The Rite's name is derived from the city of York, where, according to one Masonic legend, the first meetings of Masons in England took place. The York Rite is one of the appendant bodies of Freemasonry that a Master Mason may join to further his knowledge of Freemasonry. But the York Rite is not found as a single system worldwide, and outside of the United States there are often significant differences in ritual, as well as organization. However, in most cases, provided that the Grand Body in question regards the parent \\"Craft\\" jurisdiction as regular, each distinct Order has recognised fraternal inter- relations with the respective Grand Body within the York system. York Rite bodies Since the York Rite is actually a grouping of separate organizations joined in order, each body operates with relative autonomy. And though they are referred to as one rite it is common for individuals to be member of some bodies and not others. For example, in many jurisdictions Cryptic Masonry can be skipped allowing the person to be a member of just the Royal Arch and Knights Templar. It is also common for non-Christians to join only the Royal Arch and Council of Royal & Select Masters, as the Knights Templar require members to be willing to defend the Christian faith, if needed. But no matter what the Royal Arch is always required and membership in that body must be kept in order to maintain membership in the other two bodies. Details on the individual bodies are as follows: Royal Arch Masonry The Triple Tau. (Grand Emblem of Royal Arch Masonry) Royal Arch Masonry is the first order a Master Mason joins in the York Rite. The Chapter works the following degrees: * The Mark Master Mason degree is in some respects an extension of the Fellow Crafts' second degree. In some jurisdictions the degree is conferred in a Fellow Craft Lodge, that is, the second degree of the Blue Lodge. * The (Virtual) Past Master degree is conferred because of the traditional requirement that only Past Masters of a Blue Lodge may be admitted to Holy Royal Arch. Because there are so many applicants for this degree, Virtual Past Master is required to qualify them for it. Much of the work is the same given to install the Worshipful Master of a Blue Lodge. There is no such requirement or procedure outside the USA. * In the Most Excellent Master degree the building of King Solomon's Temple, which figures so prominently in Blue Lodge, has been completed. In England the degree is conferred by Cryptic Councils, along with three other degrees below. * The Royal Arch Mason (or Holy Royal Arch) degree is said by many to be the most beautiful degree in all of Freemasonry. Following a convocation of the Supreme Grand Chapter in England on November 10, 2004, there are currently significant ritual differences between what is worked in England and that worked in the USA. Fraternal inter- relations remain as before. Freemasons who reach this degree may continue to Cryptic Masonry or go straight to Knights Templar (where permitted‚Äîrequirements vary in different jurisdictions). Cryptic Masonry One variation of the Royal & Select Masters' Emblem, of which there are many. Membership in the Council of Royal & Select Masters or the Council of Cryptic Masons is not required for membership in the Knights Templar in some jurisdictions, so it can be skipped. In others it is required. It is called Cryptic Masonry or the Cryptic Rite because a crypt or underground room figures prominently in the degrees. *Royal Master *Select Master *Super Excellent Master In some councils, a Most Excellent Master degree is offered between Select Master and Super Excellent Master, and some jurisdictions do not have the Super Excellent Master degree. Knights Templar (Grand Encampment of Knights Templar of the U.S.A.) crowned Passion Cross laid upon the Cross patt√©e inscribed with \\"In Hoc Signo Vinces\\" resting upon crossed swords is often used in to represent the Knights Templar The Knights Templar is the final order joined in the York Rite. Unlike other Masonic bodies which only require a belief in a Supreme Being regardless of religion, membership in the Knights Templar is open only to Christian Masons who have completed their Royal Arch and in some jurisdictions their Cryptic Degrees. [Knights Templar FAQ ‚Äì How to Become a Knight Templar] This body is modeled on the historical Knights Templar to carry on the spirit of their organization. Throughout history it has been claimed that Freemasonry itself was founded by the Knights Templar or that the Knights Templar took refuge in Freemasonry after their persecution. The Grand Encampment of the United States acknowledges the existence of these theories but states that there is no proof to justify such claims. [Knights Templar FAQ], accessed January 10, 2007. A local Knights Templar division is called a Commandery and operates under a state level Grand Commandery as well as The Grand Encampment of the United States. This is unique among Masonic bodies as most report to the state level alone. The Knights Templar confer three orders, and one passing order as opposed to the standard degree system found elsewhere in Freemasonry: *The Illustrious Order of the Red Cross *The Passing Order of St. Paul (or the Mediterranean Pass) *The Order of the Knights of Malta (or simply Order of Malta) *The Order of the Temple Equivalent independent bodies Mark Master keystone, the symbol of a Mark Master Mason. *England, India, and parts of Europe and Australasia ‚Äì The Mark degree is conferred in a separately warranted Lodge of Mark Master Masons. The candidate for Advancement is required to be a Master Mason. A further degree may conferred; one not present in the York Rite, that of Royal Ark Mariner; although strictly speaking this degree is conferred in a Lodge of Royal Ark Mariners ‚Äì said lodge being 'anchored' or 'moored' to the parent Mark Lodge. In the US, this degree forms part of the Allied Masonic Degrees. In Canada, the Royal Ark Mariner degree is conferred by a Council of Royal and Select Masters. *Scotland ‚Äì The Mark degree is conferred in a Craft lodge and is seen as the completion of the Fellow Craft Degree, but the candidate for Advancement is required to be a Master Mason. The Mark may alternatively, and exceptionally, be conferred in a Holy Royal Arch Chapter as a prerequisite for Exaltation to the HRA. If a Candidate has already received his Mark Degree in his Craft Lodge, then his initiation into the Chapter is preceded by a short ceremony of Affiliation to the Mark Lodge associated (\\"moored\\") to that Chapter. Royal and Select Masters In England and Wales, the degrees of Select Master, Royal Master, Most Excellent Master and Super-Excellent Master are conferred in a separately warranted organization, the Order of Royal and Select Masters. Holy Royal Arch The position of the Holy Royal Arch among the Masonic appendant bodies in England and Wales A lodge room set out for use by a Holy Royal Arch Chapter The Holy Royal Arch is affiliated with various constitutions worldwide, many of which place different emphasis on the order. *England, Europe and Australasia ‚Äì A Holy Royal Arch Chapter is required to be sponsored by a Craft Lodge and bears the same number (and in almost all cases the same name); however, the HRA is a separate Order from Craft Freemasonry. Supreme Grand Royal Arch Chapter is governed from the headquarters of the United Grand Lodge of England, but the administration remains distinct ‚Äì though many officers of the Grand Lodge hold the equivalent office in the Grand Chapter. In these countries the Order of the Royal Arch consists of a single 'Royal Arch' degree, although there are three related ceremonies, one for the installation into each of the three Principals' chairs. As a compromise, at the union of two rival Grand Lodges in 1813 (one of which considered the Royal Arch a 'Fourth Degree', whilst the other almost totally ignored it) English Freemasonry recognised the Royal Arch as part of \\"pure, ancient masonry\\", but stated that it was not an additional degree, but merely the \\"completion of the third degree\\". However, this was merely a compromise position, and one which was in opposition to normal masonic practice, and consequently on 10 November 2004 (after much deliberation by a special working party) the Grand Chapter (at its regular meeting in London) overturned this compromise position, and declared the Royal Arch to be a separate degree in its own right, albeit the natural progression from the third degree. Words in the ritual which propounded the earlier compromise position were removed, by mandatory regulation. *Ireland ‚Äì The Royal Arch degree under the Irish Constitution is unique, and while perfectly regular and recognised, it bears little resemblance to the same degree in the sister Constitutions of England and Scotland. The Royal Arch Degree under the Irish Constitution contains a legend concerning the first Temple, not the second. The elaborate \\"Passing of the Veils\\" ceremony is essential to the Royal Arch Degree in the Irish system and after it is completed it is followed immediately by the Royal Arch degree itself, containing the story of the restoration of Solomon's Temple under King Josiah. The three presiding officers of a Royal Arch Chapter are called the Excellent King, High Priest and Chief Scribe, (not First, Second and Third Principal). Irish Royal Arch Chapters are also permitted to meet as Lodges of Mark Master Masons, and they are governed by the Supreme Grand Royal Arch Chapter of Ireland. *Scotland ‚Äì The degree is conferred in a Royal Arch Chapter which is within a wholly different administrative structure (the Supreme Grand Royal Arch Chapter of Scotland). Due to a difference in ritual, Royal Arch Masons exalted in England may not attend Scottish Royal Arch Chapters without completing the Scottish exaltation ceremony. Before receiving the Holy Royal Arch Degree the Candidate must first have the Mark degree and the degree of Excellent Master. However, those Exalted in Scotland may attend Chapter in England, or indeed any Chapter, provided it be in Amity. Knights Templar =England and Wales= The Cross patt√©e, a symbol commonly associated with both the historic and modern Knights Templar. Officially known as The United Religious, Military and Masonic Orders of the Temple and of St John of Jerusalem, Palestine, Rhodes and Malta, of England and Wales, this order is colloquially known as the Knights Templar. Local bodies of Knights Templar are known as Preceptories; local bodies of Knights of St Paul are known as Chapters; local bodies of Knights of Malta are known as Priories; all operate under a Grand or Great Priory, often with an intermediate level of Provincial Priories. Although some jurisdictions maintain a separate Great Priory of the Temple and Great Priory of Malta (as, for example, in England), the Grand Master and other officers of both Great Priories hold simultaneous equal office in both bodies. Three degrees are administered in this system: *The Degree of Knight Templar (Order of the Temple) *The Degree of Knight of St. Paul (incorporating the Mediterranean Pass) *The Degree of Knight of Malta (Order of Malta) Membership is by invitation and candidates are required to be Master Masons, holders of the degree of the Holy Royal Arch and to sign a declaration that they profess the Doctrine of the Holy and Undivided Trinity.

According to traditions current in Norway and Iceland in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, he reigned from 872 to 930. Supposedly, two of his sons, Eric Bloodaxe and Haakon the Good, succeeded Harald to become kings after his death. Most of Harald's biography remains uncertain, since the extant accounts of his life in the sagas were set down in writing around three centuries after his lifetime. Indeed, although it is possible to write a detailed account of Harald as a character in medieval Icelandic sagas (as this entry does), it is even possible to argue that there was no such historical figure at all. His life is described in several of the Kings' sagas, none of them older than the twelfth century. Their accounts of Harald and his life differ on many points, but it is clear that in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries Harald was regarded as having unified Norway into one kingdom. Meaning of epithet h√°rfagri Old Norse h√°r translates straightforwardly into English as 'hair', but fagr, the adjective of which fagri is a form, is trickier to render, since it means 'fair, fine, beautiful'Geir T.

Zo√´ga, A Concise Dictionary of Old Icelandic (Oxford: Clarendon, 1910), s.v. h√°r-fagr. in English 'fair-haired' means 'blond', whereas the Old Norse fairly clearly means 'beautiful-haired' (in contrast to the epithet which, according to some sources, Haraldr previously bore: l√∫fa, '(thick) matted hair').Paul R.

Accordingly, some translators prefer to render h√°rfagri as 'the fine-haired'Judith Jesch, 'Norse Historical Traditions and Historia Gruffud vab Kenan: Magnus Berfoettr and Haraldr Harfagri', in Gruffudd ap Cynan: A Collaborative Biography, edited by K. L. Maund (Cambridge: Boydell, 1996), pp. 117‚Äì47 (p. 139 n. 62). or 'fine-hair'E.g. Margaret Cormack, 'Fact and Fiction in the Icelandic Sagas, History Compass, 5/1 (2007), 201‚Äì17 (p. 203) .E.g.

(which, however, unhelpfully implies that Haraldr's hairs were slender) or even 'handsome-hair'.Edith Andersen, I Am from Iceland: A Memoir (Lulu, 2010), p. 4. Historicity Through the nineteenth and most of the twentieth centuries, historians broadly accepted the account of Harald Fairhair given by later Icelandic sagas. However, Peter Sawyer began to cast doubt on this in 1976,P. H. Sawyer, 'Harald Fairhair and the British Isles', in les Vikings et leur civilisation: probl√®mes actuelles, ed. by R√©gis Boyer (Paris, 1976), pp. 105‚Äì9. and the decades around 2000 saw a wave of revisionist research that suggested that Harald Fairhair did not exist, or at least not in a way resembling his appearance in sagas.Claus Krag, 'Norge som odel i Harald H√•rfagres √¶tt. Et m√∏te med en gjenganger', Historisk tidskrift, 3 (1989), 288‚Äì302.Alexandra Pesch, Bruna«´ld, haugs«´ld, kirkju«´ld: Untersuchungen zu den arch√§ologisch uberprufbaren Aussagen in der Heimskringla des Snorri Sturluson (Frankfurt am Main: Lang, 1996).Judith Jesch, 'Norse Historical Traditions and Historia Gruffud vab Kenan: Magnus Berfoettr and Haraldr Harfagri', in Gruffudd ap Cynan: A Collaborative Biography, edited by K.

The key arguments for this are as follows: * There is no contemporary support for the claims of later sagas about Harald Fairhair. The first king of Norway recorded in near-contemporary sources is Haraldr Gormsson (d. c. 985/986), who is claimed to be the king not only of Denmark but also Norway on the Jelling stones. The late ninth-century account of Norway provided by Ohthere to the court of Alfred the Great and the history by Adam of Bremen written in 1075 record no King of Norway for the relevant period. Although sagas have Erik Bloodaxe, who does seem partly to correspond to a historical figure, as the son of Harald Fairhair, no independent evidence supports this genealogical connection.Clare Downham, \\"Eric Bloodaxe ‚Äì axed? The Mystery of the Last Viking King of York\\", Mediaeval Scandinavia, 14 (2004), 51‚Äì77. The twelfth- century William of Malmesbury does describe a Norwegian king called Haraldus visiting King √Üthelstan of England (d. 939), which is consistent with later saga-traditions in which Harald Fairhair fostered a son, H√°kon A√∞alsteinsf√≥stri, on √Üthelstan.Angela Marion Smith, 'King √Üthelstan in the English, Continental and Scandinavian Traditions of the Tenth to the Thirteenth Centuries' (unpublished Ph.D. thesis, University of Leeds, 2014), pp. 255‚Äì73. But William is a late source and Harald a far from uncommon name for a Scandinavian character,Sverrir Jakobsson, 'Var Haraldur h√°rfagri bara uppspuni Snorra Sturlusonar?', V√≠sindavefurinn (25 September 2006). and William does not give this Harald the epithet fairhair, whereas he does give that epithet to the later Norwegian king Haraldr Sigur√∞arson. * Although Harald Fairhair appears in diverse Icelandic sagas, few if any of these are independent sources. It is plausible that all these were participating in a shared textual tradition begun by the earliest Icelandic prose account of Harald, Ari √ûorgilsson's √çslendingab√≥k. Dating from the early twelfth century, this was written over 250 years after Harald's supposed death. * The saga evidence is potentially pre-dated by two skaldic poems, Haraldskv√¶√∞iR. D. Fulk 2012, ‚Äò√ûorbj«´rn hornklofi, Haraldskv√¶√∞i (Hrafnsm√°l)‚Äô in Diana Whaley (ed.), Poetry from the Kings‚Äô Sagas 1: From Mythical Times to c. 1035.

Turnhout: Brepols, pp. 73 ff. which have been attributed to √ûorbj√∂rn hornklofi or alternatively (in the case of the first poem) to √ûj√≥√∞√≥lfr of Hvinir, and are according to the sagas about Harald Fairhair. Although only preserved in thirteenth-century Kings' sagas, they might have been transmitted orally (as the sagas claim) from the tenth century. The first describes life at the court of a king called Harald, mentions that he took a Danish wife, and that he won a battle at Hafrsfjord. The second poem relates a series of battles won by a king called Harald. However, the information supplied in these poems is inconsistent with the tales in the sagas in which they are transmitted, and the sagas themselves often disagree on the details of his background and biography. Meanwhile, the most reliable manuscripts of Haraldskv√¶√∞i call the poem's honorand Haraldr H√°lfdanarson rather than Haraldr h√°rfagri,R. D. Fulk 2012, ‚Äò√ûorbj«´rn hornklofi, Haraldskv√¶√∞i (Hrafnsm√°l)‚Äô in Diana Whaley (ed.), Poetry from the Kings‚Äô Sagas 1: From Mythical Times to c. 1035. Skaldic Poetry of the Scandinavian Middle Ages 1. Turnhout: Brepols, pp. 91 ff. and Glymdr√°pa offers no epithet at all. All the poems suggest is that there was once a king called Haraldr (H√°lfdanarson). * Sources from the British Isles which are independent of the Icelandic saga-tradition (and partly of each other), and are mostly earlier than the sagas, do attest to a king whose name corresponds to the Old Norse name Haraldr inn h√°rfagri‚Äîbut they use this name of the well attested Haraldr Sigur√∞arson (d. 1066, often known in modern English as Harald Hardrada). These sources include manuscript D of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle ('Harold Harfagera', under the year 1066) and the related histories by Orderic Vitalis ('Harafagh', re events in 1066), John of Worcester ('Harvagra', s.aa. 1066 and 1098), and William of Malmesbury (Gesta regum Anglorum, 'Harvagre', s.a. regarding 1066); Marianus Scotus of Mainz ('Arbach', d. 1082/1083); and the Life of Gruffydd ap Cynan ('Haraldum Harfagyr', later twelfth century, though this may refer to two different kings by this name).Judith Jesch, 'Norse Historical Traditions and Historia Gruffud vab Kenan: Magnus Berfoettr and Haraldr Harfagri', in Gruffudd ap Cynan: A Collaborative Biography, edited by K. L. Maund (Cambridge: Boydell, 1996), pp. 117‚Äì47 (pp. 139‚Äì47).Shami Ghosh, Kings' Sagas and Norwegian History: Problems and Perspectives, The Northern World, 54 (Leiden: Brill, 2011), pp. 66‚Äì70.Sverrir Jakobsson, 'The Early Kings of Norway, the Issue of Agnatic Succession, and the Settlement of Iceland', Viator, 47 (2016), 171‚Äì88 (pp. 1‚Äì18 in open-access text, at p. 7); .Vits Griffini Filii Conani: The Medieval Latin Life of Gruffydd ap Cynan, ed. and trans. by Paul Russell (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 2005), pp. 54-57 (chs 4-5). Thus the Icelandic saga-tradition of Harald Fair-Hair can be seen as part of an origin myth created to explain the settlement of Iceland, perhaps in which a cognomen of Haraldr Sigur√∞arson was transferred to a fictitious early king of all Norway.Sayaka Matsumoto, 'A Foundation Myth of Iceland: Reflections on the tradition of Haraldr h√°rfagri', Êó•Êú¨„Ç¢„Ç§„Çπ„É©„É≥„ÉâÂ≠¶‰ºö‰ºöÂ†± (2011), 30: 1‚Äì22.G√≠sli Sigur√∞sson, 'Constructing a Past to Suit the Present: Sturla √û√≥r√∞arson on Conflicts and Alliances with King Haraldr h√°rfagri', in Minni and Muninn: Memory in Medieval Nordic Culture, ed. by Pernille Hermann, Stephen A. Mitchell, and Agnes S. Arn√≥rsd√≥ttir, AS 4 (Turnhout: Brepols, 2014), pp. 175‚Äì96 . Sverrir Jakobsson has suggested that the idea of Iceland being settled by people fleeing an overbearing Norwegian monarch actually reflects the anxieties of Iceland in the early thirteenth century, when the island was indeed coming under Norwegian dominance. He has also suggested that the legend of Harald Fairhair developed in the twelfth century to enable Norwegian kings, who were then promoting the idea of primogeniture over the older custom of agnatic succession, to claim that their ancestors had had a right to Norway by lineal descent from the country's supposed first king.Sverrir Jakobsson, 'The Early Kings of Norway, the Issue of Agnatic Succession, and the Settlement of Iceland', Viator, 47 (2016), 171‚Äì88; . Saga descriptions In the Saga of Harald Fairhair in Heimskringla, which is the most elaborate although not the oldest or most reliable source to the life of Harald, it is written that Harald succeeded, on the death of his father Halfdan the Black Gudr√∂darson, to the sovereignty of several small, and somewhat scattered kingdoms in Vestfold, which had come into his father's hands through conquest and inheritance. His protector-regent was his mother's brother Guthorm. The unification of Norway is something of a love story. It begins with a marriage proposal that resulted in rejection and scorn from Gyda, the daughter of Eirik, king of Hordaland. She said she refused to marry Harald \\"before he was king over all of Norway\\". Harald was therefore induced to take a vow not to cut nor comb his hair until he was sole king of Norway, and when he was justified in trimming it ten years later, he exchanged the epithet \\"Shockhead\\" or \\"Tanglehair\\" (Haraldr l√∫fa) for the one by which he is usually known. In 866, Harald made the first of a series of conquests over the many petty kingdoms which would compose all of Norway, including V√§rmland in Sweden, which had sworn allegiance to the Swedish saga-king Erik Eymundsson (whose historicity is not confirmed). In 872, after a great victory at Hafrsfjord near Stavanger, Harald found himself king over the whole country, ruling from his Kongsg√•rd seats at Avaldsnes and Alrekstad. His realm was, however, threatened by dangers from without, as large numbers of his opponents had taken refuge, not only in Iceland, then recently discovered; but also in the Orkney Islands, Shetland Islands, Hebrides Islands, Faroe Islands and the northern European mainland. However, his opponents' leaving was not entirely voluntary. Many Norwegian chieftains who were wealthy and respected posed a threat to Harald; therefore, they were subjected to much harassment from Harald, prompting them to vacate the land. At last, Harald was forced to make an expedition to the West, to clear the islands and the Scottish mainland of some Vikings who tried to hide there.P. H. Sawyer, \\"Harald Fairhair and the British Isles\\", in \\"Les Vikings et leurs civilisation\\", ed. R. Boyer (Paris, 1976), pp. 105‚Äì09. The earliest narrative source which mentions Harald, the twelfth-century √çslendingab√≥k, notes that Iceland was settled during his lifetime. Harald is thus depicted as the prime cause of the Norse settlement of Iceland and beyond. Iceland was settled by \\"malcontents\\" from Norway, who resented Harald's claim of rights of taxation over lands, which the possessors appear to have previously held in absolute ownership. There are several accounts of large feasting mead halls constructed for important feasts when Scandinavian royalty was invited. According to a legend recorded by Snorri Sturluson, in the Heimskringla, the late 9th-century V√§rmlandish chieftain √Åki invited both the Norwegian king Harald Fairhair and the Swedish saga-king Erik Eymundsson, but had the Norwegian king stay in the newly constructed and sumptuous one, because he was the youngest one of the kings and the one who had the greatest prospects. The older Swedish king, on the other hand, had to stay in the old feasting hall. The Swedish king was so humiliated that he killed √Åki. Later life Harald I's division of Norway 930 CE. Not shown: the domains of the jarls of Nor√∞reyjar and Su√∞reyjar. According to the saga sources, the latter part of Harald's reign was disturbed by the strife of his many sons. The number of sons he left varies in the different saga accounts, from 11 to 20. Twelve of his sons are named as kings, two of them over the whole country. He gave them all the royal title and assigned lands to them, which they were to govern as his representatives; but this arrangement did not put an end to the discord, which continued into the next reign. When he grew old, Harald handed over the supreme power to his favourite son Eirik Bloodaxe, whom he intended to be his successor. Eirik I ruled side-by-side with his father when Harald was 80 years old. Harald died three years later due to age in approximately 933. Harald Harfager was commonly stated to have been buried under a mound at Haugar by the Strait of Karmsund near the church in Haugesund, an area that later would be named the town and municipal Haugesund. The area near Karmsund was the traditional burial site for several early Norwegian rulers. The national monument of Haraldshaugen was raised in 1872, to commemorate the Battle of Hafrsfjord which is traditionally dated to 872.Heimskringla, The Chronicle of the Kings of Norway Issue Harald Haarfager later in his life While the various sagas name anywhere from 11 to 20 sons of Harald in various contexts, the contemporary skaldic poem H√°konarm√°l says that Harald's son H√•kon would meet only \\"eight brothers\\" when arriving in Valhalla, a place for slain warriors, kings, and Germanic heroes. Only the following five names of sons can be confirmed from skaldic poems (with saga claims in parentheses), while the full number of sons remains unknown: * Eric Bloodaxe (by Ragnhild Eiriksdotter from Jutland, Denmark) * H√•kon the Good (by Tora Mosterstong from Moster, Sunnhordland, Norway) * Ragnvald * Bj√∏rn (Bj√∏rn Farmann?) * Halvdan, possibly two by that name =According to Heimskringla= The full list of sons according to Snorri Sturluson's Heimskringla: Children with √Ösa, daughter of H√•kon Grjotgardssson, Jarl av Lade: * Guttorm Haraldsson, king of R√•nrike * Halvdan Kvite (Haraldsson), king of Trondheim * Halvdan Svarte Haraldsson, king of Trondheim * Sigr√∏d Haraldsson, king of Trondheim Children with Gyda Eiriksdottir: * √Ölov √Örbot Haraldsdotter (Rogaland, 875 - Giske, M√∏re og Romsdal, 935), married √æ√≥rir Teiande, \\"Thore/Tore den Tause\\" (\\"the Silent\\") Ragnvaldsson (c. 862 - Giske, M√∏re og Romsdal, a. 935), Jarl av M√∏re, and had issue * R√∏rek Haraldsson * Sigtrygg Haraldsson * Frode Haraldsson * Torgils Haraldsson ‚Äì identified as \\"Thorgest\\" in the (dates not correct) Irish history Children with Svanhild, daughter of √òystein Jarl: * Bj√∏rn Farmann Haraldss√∏on, king of Vestfold and reputed great-grandfather of Norwegian king Olaf II. * Olaf Haraldsson Geirstadalf, king of Vingulmark, later also Vestfold, and reputed father of Tryggve Olafsson, father of Norwegian king Olaf I. * Ragnar Rykkel Haraldsson Children with √Öshild, daughter of Ring Dagsson: * Ring Haraldsson * Dag Haraldsson * Gudr√∏d Skirja Haraldsdotter * Ingegjerd Haraldsdotter Children with Sn√∏frid, daughter of Sv√•se the Finn: * Halfdan Halegg Haraldsson or \\"Long-Leg\\", was executed with the Blood eagle ritual by Torf-Einarr detailed in the Orkneyinga saga and Heimskringla * Gudr√∏d Ljome Haraldsdotter * Ragnvald Rettilbeine Haraldsson, murdered by Eirik Blod√∏ks on Harald's orders * Sigurd Rise Haraldsson Other children: * Ingebj√∏rg Haraldsdotter (Lade, Trondheim, c. 865 - 920), married Halvdan Jarl (c. 865 - 920), Finnmarksjarl, and had issue through an only daughter In popular culture The 1872 monument to Harald at Haraldshaugen. In Norway Harald Fairhair became an important figure in Norwegian nationalism in the nineteenth century, during its struggle for independence from Sweden, when he served as 'a heroic narrative character disseminating a foundation story of Norway becoming an independent nation'.Torgrim Sneve Guttormsen, 'Branding local heritage and popularising a remote past: The example of Haugesund in Western Norway', AP: Online Journal in Public Archaeology, 1 (2014), 45‚Äì60 (p. 47). In particular, a national monument to Harald was erected in 1872 on Haraldshaugen, a prehistoric burial mound at the town of Haugesund then imagined to be Harald Finehair's burial place, despite opposition from left- wing politicians. Haraldshaugen Monument (June 2018) The claim to Harald became important to the development of the tourism industry in the town and its region: > today, King Harald Fairhair is associated with several archaeological sites > where modern monuments and theme parks (obelisks, towers, sculptures, > ‚Äòreconstructions‚Äô of ancient houses/villages) are constructed and where > various commemorative practices (jubilees, rallies, festivals) are being > performed.

Stone Celtic crosses, such as this, are a major source of knowledge regarding Celtic knot design. Carpet page from Lindisfarne Gospels, showing knotwork detail. Almost all of the folios of the Book of Kells contain small illuminations like this decorated initial. Celtic knots (, , ) are a variety of knots and stylized graphical representations of knots used for decoration, used extensively in the Celtic style of Insular art. These knots are most known for their adaptation for use in the ornamentation of Christian monuments and manuscripts, such as the 8th-century St. Teilo Gospels, the Book of Kells and the Lindisfarne Gospels. Most are endless knots, and many are varieties of basket weave knots.  History  The use of interlace patterns had its origins in the late Roman Empire. Knot patterns first appeared in the third and fourth centuries AD and can be seen in Roman floor mosaics of that time. Interesting developments in the artistic use of interlaced knot patterns are found in Byzantine architecture and book illumination, Coptic art, Celtic art, Islamic art, Kievan Rus'ian book illumination, Ethiopian art, and European architecture and book illumination. Spirals, step patterns, and key patterns are dominant motifs in Celtic art before the Christian influence on the Celts, which began around 450. These designs found their way into early Christian manuscripts and artwork with the addition of depictions from life, such as animals, plants and even humans. In the beginning, the patterns were intricate interwoven cords, called plaits, which can also be found in other areas of Europe, such as Italy, in the 6th century. A fragment of a Gospel Book, now in the Durham Cathedral library and created in northern Britain in the 7th century, contains the earliest example of true knotted designs in the Celtic manner. Examples of plait work (a woven, unbroken cord design) predate knotwork designs in several cultures around the world, but the broken and reconnected plait work that is characteristic of true knotwork began in northern Italy and southern Gaul and spread to Ireland by the 7th century. The style is most commonly associated with the Celtic lands, but it was also practiced extensively in England and was exported to Europe by Irish and Northumbrian monastic activities on the continent. J. Romilly Allen has identified \\"eight elementary knots which form the basis of nearly all the interlaced patterns in Celtic decorative art\\". In modern times, Celtic art is popularly thought of in terms of national identity and therefore specifically Irish, Scottish or Welsh. The Celtic knot as a tattoo design became popular in the United States in the 1970s and 1980s.

For the Paschal triple-candle used in Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches see Paschal trikirion. The Paschal candle of Cubao Cathedral following the Easter Vigil, Quezon City, the Philippines, 2013 A Paschal candle is a big, white candle used in liturgies in Western Christianity (viz., the Roman Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion, Lutheran, and Methodist churches, among others). A new Paschal candle is blessed and lit every year at Easter, and is used throughout the Paschal season which is during Easter and then throughout the year on special occasions, such as baptisms and funerals. The equivalent of the Paschal candle in the Western Orthodox Church is the Paschal trikirion, which differs in both style and usage.  Etymology The term Paschal comes from the Latin word Pascha, which came from the Hebrew word Pesach, which in Hebrew means 'Passover', and relates to the Paschal mystery of salvation. It is sometimes referred to as the \\"Easter candle\\" or the \\"Christ candle.\\"  Description  Some Paschal candles in the Netherlands For congregations that use a Paschal candle, it is the largest candle in the worship space. In most cases today the candle will display several common symbols: # The cross is always the central symbol, most clearly identifying it as the Paschal candle # The Greek letters alpha and omega signify that God is the beginning and the end (from the Book of Revelation) # The current year represents God in the present amidst the congregation # Five grains of incense (most often red) are embedded in the candle (sometimes encased in wax \\"nails\\") during the Easter Vigil to represent the five wounds of Jesus: the three nails that pierced his hands and feet, the spear thrust into his side, and the thorns that crowned his head. In the [medieval] Church, Paschal candles often reached a stupendous size. The Paschal candle of Salisbury Cathedral was said to have been 36 feet (11 metres) tall. Today, in the United States and Southern Europe (e.g., Italy and France) the candle is approximately 4 inches (10 centimetres) in diameter and 36 to 48 inches (90 to 120 centimetres) tall; in Northern Europe the candle tends to be shorter in height (19 to 24 inches/50 to 60 centimetres) and wider in diameter (3 to 5 inches/8 to 13 centimetres).  Usage   Easter Vigil  For churches that celebrate the Easter Vigil on the night of Holy Saturday, the ceremonial lighting of the Paschal candle is one of the most solemn moments of the service. On Maundy Thursday of the same week the entire church is darkened by extinguishing all candles and lamps. This represents the darkness of a world without God. Brazier used for kindling the \\"New Fire\\" At the opening of the Easter Vigil a \\"new fire\\" is lit and blessed. The minister will trace the symbols (mentioned above) on the Paschal candle, saying words similar to: \\"Christ, yesterday and today, the beginning and the end, the Alpha and Omega. To Him belongs all time and all the ages; all glory and dominion is his now and forever. Amen.\\" They then insert five grains of incense (reminiscent of the nails used to fasten Christ on the Cross) on the five points of the cross , saying: \\"By His holy and glorious wounds may Christ our Lord guard and keep us.\\" The Paschal candle is the first candle to be lit with a flame from this sacred fire, representing the light of Christ coming into the world. This represents the risen Christ, as a symbol of light (life) dispelling darkness (death). As it is lit, the minister may say words similar to: \\"The light of Christ, rising in Glory, dispel the darkness of our hearts and minds.\\" Deacon chanting the Exultet beside a Paschal candle Typically, the worshiping assembly then processes into the church led by the Paschal candle. The candle is raised three times during the procession, accompanied by the chant \\"The light of Christ\\" to which the assembly responds \\"Thanks be to God\\". Following the procession the Exultet is chanted, traditionally by a deacon, but it may be chanted by the priest or a cantor. The Exultet concludes with a blessing of the candle: > Accept this Easter candle, > a flame divided but undimmed, > a pillar of fire that glows to the honor of God. > (For it is fed by the holy melting wax, which the mother bee brought forth > to make this precious candle.) > Let it mingle with the lights of heaven > and continue bravely burning > to dispel the darkness of this night! > May the Morning Star which never sets > find this flame still burning: > Christ, that Morning Star, > who came back from the dead, > and shed his peaceful light on all humanity, > your Son, who lives and reigns for ever and ever. > Amen. From the New Roman Missal: > On this, your night of grace, O holy Father, accept this candle, a solemn > offering, the work of bees and of your servants‚Äô hands, an evening sacrifice > of praise, this gift from your most holy Church. But now we know the praises > of this pillar, which glowing fire ignites for God‚Äôs honor, a fire into many > flames divided, yet never dimmed by sharing of its light, for it is fed by > melting wax, drawn out by mother bees to build a torch so precious. O truly > blessed night, when things of heaven are wed to those of earth, and divine > to the human. Therefore, O Lord, we pray you that this candle, hallowed to > the honor of your name, may persevere undimmed, to overcome the darkness of > this night. Receive it as a pleasing fragrance, and let it mingle with the > lights of heaven. May this flame be found still burning by the Morning Star: > the one Morning Star who never sets, Christ your Son, who, coming back from > death‚Äôs domain, has shed his peaceful light on humanity, and lives and > reigns for ever and ever. R. Amen. In some traditions, the base of the candle may be ritually immersed in the baptismal font before proceeding with the remainder of the service. This candle is traditionally the one from which all other lights are taken for the Easter service.  Other times of the year  The Paschal candle. Note that the year it was used was 2005 (St. Olav's Cathedral, Oslo). The candle remains lit at all worship services throughout Easter season which ends on Pentecost Sunday, (or in some traditions until Ascension Day, when it is extinguished just after the Gospel), during which time it is located in the sanctuary close to the altar. After the Easter season, it is frequently placed near the baptismal font. Before 1955, the option existed of blessing the baptismal font on the Vigil of Pentecost, and this was the only time the Paschal candle would be lit at services after Ascension. The Paschal candle is also lit during baptisms to signify the Holy Spirit and fire that John the Baptist promised to those who were baptised in Christ. During the baptismal rite in many traditions, a small lit candle will be given to the newly baptised by a member of the community, with words similar to, \\"Let your light so shine before others, that they might see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.\\" () The Paschal candle is also lit and placed near the casket or urn during funeral services such as the Mass of Repose and the Mass of Requiem.its important to note that once lit the candle should remain burning until finished. This is to signify the hope of the resurrection into which Christians are baptised. Eastern usage In the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches, there is no direct correspondence to the Western Paschal candle. However, throughout Bright Week, the priest carries a cross and paschal trikirion at all of the services, especially when censing, during the Little Entrance or when giving the Paschal greeting. The trikirion consists of three lit candles in a candlestick, which the priest carries in his left hand. In the Slavic tradition, the three candles may be white or different colors: green, red, blue. The deacon also carries a special Paschal candle which is a single large candle whenever he leads an ektenia (litany) or censes.

Although the population recorded in the 2011 census was only 10,536, (increased to 12,000 by 2018) and with a built-up area of just 3.244 square kilometres, Wells has had city status since medieval times, because of the presence of Wells Cathedral. Often described as England's smallest city, it is actually second smallest to the City of London in area and population, but unlike London it is not part of a larger urban agglomeration. Wells takes its name from three wells dedicated to Saint Andrew, one in the market place and two within the grounds of the Bishop's Palace and cathedral. A small Roman settlement surrounded them, which grew in importance and size under the Anglo-Saxons when King Ine of Wessex founded a minster church there in 704. The community became a trading centre based on cloth making and Wells is notable for its 17th- century involvement in both the English Civil War and Monmouth Rebellion. In the 19th century, transport infrastructure improved with stations on three different railway lines. However, since 1964 the city has been without a railway link. The cathedral and the associated religious and medieval architectural history provide much of the employment. The city has a variety of sporting and cultural activities and houses several schools including The Blue School, a state coeducational comprehensive school that was founded in 1641, and the independent Wells Cathedral School, that was founded possibly as early as 909 and is one of the five established musical schools for school-age children in the United Kingdom. Wells' historic architecture has led to the city being used as a shooting location for numerous films and television programmes. History One of the three wells which give the city its name; two are located in the gardens of the Bishop's Palace (as shown) and one in the Market Place. The city was a Roman settlement that became an important centre under the Anglo-Saxons when King Ine of Wessex founded a minster church in 704. Two hundred years later, in 909, it became the seat of the newly formed bishopric of Wells; but in 1090, the bishop's seat was removed to Bath. The move caused severe arguments between the canons of Wells and the monks of Bath until 1245 when the bishopric was renamed the Diocese of Bath and Wells, to be elected by both religious houses. With the construction of the current cathedral and the bishop's palace in the first half of the 13th century, under the direction of Bishop Reginald and later Bishop Jocelin, a native of the city, Wells became the principal seat of the diocese. Wells was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Welle, from the Old English , not as a town but as four manors with a population of 132, which implies a population of 500‚Äì600. Earlier names for the settlement have been identified which include Fontanetum, in a charter of 725 granted by King Ina to Glastonbury and Fontanensis Ecclesia. \\"Tidesput\\" or \\"Tithesput furlang\\" relates to the area east of the bishop's garden in 1245. Wells was part of, and gave its name to, the hundred of Wells Forum. Wells had been granted charters to hold markets by Bishop Robert (1136‚Äì66) and free burgage tenure was granted by Bishop Reginald (1174‚Äì1191). Wells was recognised as a free borough by a Royal charter of King John in 1201. The city remained under episcopal control until its charter of incorporation from Queen Elizabeth I in 1589.Wells City Council The Council City status was most recently confirmed by Queen Elizabeth II by letters patent issued under the Great Seal dated 1 April 1974, which granted city status specifically to the civil parish;London Gazette, issue no. 46255, 4 April 1974 on that date major local government reorganisation came into effect, which involved the abolition of the municipal borough of Wells.Vision of Britain Wells MB During the English Civil War (1642‚Äì1651), at what became known as the \\"Siege of Wells\\", the city found itself surrounded by Parliamentarian guns on the Bristol, Glastonbury and Shepton Mallet sides. Col. William Strode had 2,000 men and 150 horse. The Royalists evacuated the city. Parliamentarian troops then used the cathedral to stable their horses and damaged much of the ornate sculpture by using it for firing practice. William Penn stayed in Wells shortly before leaving for America (1682), spending a night at The Crown Inn. Here he was briefly arrested for addressing a large crowd in the market place, but released on the intervention of the Bishop of Bath and Wells. During the Monmouth Rebellion (1685) the rebel army attacked the cathedral in an outburst against the established church and damaged the west front. Lead from the roof was used to make bullets, windows were broken, the organ smashed and horses stabled in the nave. Wells was the final location of the Bloody Assizes on 23 September 1685. In a makeshift court lasting only one day, over 500 men were tried and the majority sentenced to death. Vicars' Close facing the cathedral The 8th-century port at Bleadney on the River Axe enabled goods to be brought to within of Wells. In the Middle Ages overseas trade was carried out from the port of Rackley. In the 14th century a French ship sailed up the river, and by 1388 Thomas Tanner from Wells used Rackley to export cloth and corn to Portugal, and received iron and salt in exchange. Wells had been a centre for cloth making; however, in the 16th and 17th centuries this diminished, but the city retained its important market focus. Wells in the 19th century had the largest cheese market in the west of England. Wells first station, Priory Road, opened in 1859 on the Somerset Central Railway (later the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway) as the terminus of a short branch from Glastonbury. A second railway, the East Somerset, opened a branch line from Witham in 1862 and built a station to the east of Priory Road. In 1870, the Cheddar Valley line branch of the Bristol and Exeter Railway from Yatton, reached Wells and built a third station at Tucker Street. Matters were simplified when the Great Western Railway acquired the Cheddar Valley and the East Somerset lines and built a link between them that ran through the S&DJR;'s Priory Road station. In 1878, when through trains began running between Yatton and Witham, the East Somerset station closed, but through trains did not stop at Priory Road until 1934. Priory Road closed to passenger traffic in 1951 when the S&DJR; branch line from Glastonbury was shut, though it remained the city's main goods depot. Tucker Street closed in 1963 under the Beeching Axe, which closed the Yatton to Witham line to passengers. Goods traffic to Wells ceased in 1964. A Pacific SR West Country, West Country Class steam locomotive no 34092 built by the British Railways Board was named City of Wells following a ceremony in the city's Priory Road station in 1949. It was used to draw the Golden Arrow service between London and the Continent. It was withdrawn from service in 1964, and rescued from a scrapyard in 1971. It is now undergoing a complete restoration on the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway in Yorkshire. During World War II, Stoberry Park in Wells was the location of a prisoner-of-war camp, housing Italian prisoners from the Western Desert Campaign, and later German prisoners after the Battle of Normandy. Penleigh Camp on the Wookey Hole Road was a German working camp. Governance Bishop's Eye gatehouse (to the Bishop's Palace) is at the far end; two of Wells Cathedral's towers can be seen rising behind the buildings.

The Somerset Light Infantry received the freedom of the City of Wells following their return from Cyprus in 1956. City status thumbrightMap of Wells showing city/parish border, and urban area. As the seat of an ancient cathedral and diocese, Wells is historically regarded as a city. City status was most recently confirmed by Queen Elizabeth II by letters patent dated 1 April 1974, which granted city status specifically to the civil parish. As the designation is typically awarded to a local council area, this administrative area is then considered to be the formal boundary of the city, including its urban and rural extents. Wells, due to its urban area and wider parish sizes, is near-smallest city on several measures based on 2011 statistics: * Its city council boundary area, surrounded wholly by countryside makes Wells the smallest free-standing city in the UK (2.11 sq mi)  the City of London is smaller (1.12) but is part of a much larger urban area (Greater London - 671 sq mi) * 2nd smallest in England and UK by city council boundary area (2.11 sq mi) behind the City of London (1.12) * 2nd smallest in England only by population and urban area (10,536 residents, 1.35 sq mi) behind the City of London (8,072, 1.12) * 4th smallest in the UK by population and urban area behind St Davids (1,841 residents, 0.23 sq mi), St Asaph (3,355, 0.50) and the City of London (8,072, 1.12). Geography Wells lies at the foot of the southern escarpment of the Mendip Hills where they meet the Somerset Levels. The hills are largely made of carboniferous limestone, which is quarried at several nearby sites. In the 1960s, the tallest mast in the region, the Mendip UHF television transmitter, was installed on Pen Hill above Wells, approximately from the centre the city. Keward Brook Streams passing through caves on the Mendip Hills, including Thrupe Lane Swallet and Viaduct Sink (approximately east of the city), emerge at Saint Andrew's Well in the garden of the Bishop's Palace, from where the water fills the moat around the Palace and then flows into Keward Brook, which carries it for approximately a mile west to the point where the brook joins the River Sheppey in the village of Coxley. Along with the rest of South West England, the Mendip Hills have a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The annual mean temperature is about 10 ¬∞C (50 ¬∞F) with seasonal and diurnal variations, but due to the modifying effect of the sea, the range is less than in most other parts of the United Kingdom. January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between 1 ¬∞C (34 ¬∞F) and 2 ¬∞C (36 ¬∞F). July and August are the warmest months in the region with mean daily maxima around 21 ¬∞C (70 ¬∞F). In general, December is the dullest month and June the sunniest. The south west of England enjoys a favoured location, particularly in summer, when the Azores High extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK. Cloud often forms inland, especially near hills, and reduces exposure to sunshine. The average annual sunshine totals around 1600 hours. Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds and a large proportion of the annual precipitation falls from showers and thunderstorms at this time of year. Average rainfall is around 800‚Äì900 mm (31‚Äì35 in). About 8‚Äì15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, with June to August having the lightest. The predominant wind direction is from the south west. The civil parish of Wells is entirely surrounded by the parish of St Cuthbert Out. Looking west from the tower of the cathedral Demography The population of the civil parish, recorded in the 2011 census, is 10,536. Of this number 97.5% are ethnically White (with the more specific White British category recorded at 93.5%) and 66.5% described themselves as Christian. The mean average age in 2011 was 41.9 years (the median age being 43). The population recorded for the Wells civil parish in the 2001 census was 10,406. Economy Following construction of the A39/A371 bypass, the centre of the city has returned to being that of a quiet market town. It has all the modern conveniences plus shops, hotels and restaurants. Wells is a popular tourist destination, due to its historical sites, its proximity to Bath, Stonehenge and Glastonbury and its closeness to the Somerset coast. Also nearby are Wookey Hole Caves, the Mendip Hills and the Somerset Levels. Somerset cheese, including Cheddar, is made locally. Wells is part of the Wells & Shepton Mallet Travel to Work Area which also includes Glastonbury, Cheddar and surrounding areas. The historic part of the city has often been used for filming both documentaries and many period films and television series, including some with very large productions. Recent examples (2014 to 2016) include filming for Series 2 of Poldark (2015 TV series), Dunkirk (2017 film), Another Mother's Son, Broadchurch, The Levelling, Mum's List and The White Princess (miniseries). In addition to Wells Cathedral, the Bishop's Palace, Wells is particularly popular among productions, with filming at the latter conducted (in 2015‚Äì2016) for The Huntsman: Winter's War, Galavant, Terry and Mason's The Great British Food Trip, Escape to the Country and Holiday of My Lifetime, in addition to The White Princess (miniseries). Transport Wells bus station Wells is situated at the junction of three numbered routes. The A39 goes north-east to Bath and south-west to Glastonbury and Bridgwater. The A371 goes north-west to Cheddar and Weston-super-Mare, and east to Shepton Mallet. The B3139 goes west to Highbridge, and north-east to Radstock and Trowbridge. Wells is linked to the M5 motorway at junction 23 around away. A proposed extension of the Avon Ring Road (A4174) from Hicks Gate Roundabout between Keynsham and Bristol to the A37 south of Whitchurch would provide a direct link from Wells to the M32 and M4 north of Bristol.Newspaper report. Wells is served by First West of England bus services to Bristol and Bristol Temple Meads station, Bath, Frome, Shepton Mallet, Yeovil, Street and Weston- super-Mare, as well as providing some local service.

The Church of St Cuthbert (which tourists often mistake for the cathedral) has a fine Somerset stone tower and a superb carved roof. Originally an Early English building (13th century), it was much altered in the Perpendicular period (15th century). The nave's coloured ceiling was repainted in 1963 at the instigation of the then Vicar's wife, Mrs Barnett. Until 1561 the church had a central tower which either collapsed or was removed, and has been replaced with the current tower over the west door. Bells were cast for the tower by Roger Purdy. The polychromatic stone Church of St Thomas was built during 1856 and 1857 and extended by Samuel Sanders Teulon in 1864, commemorating the work of Richard Jenkyns the Dean of Wells who had cared for the poor in the east of the city.

The west front is said to be the finest collection of statuary in Europe, retaining almost 300 of its original medieval statues, carved from the cathedral's warm, yellow Doulting stone. The Chapter House, at the top of a flight of stone stairs, leading out from the north transept is an octagonal building with a fan-vaulted ceiling. It is here that the business of running the cathedral is still conducted by the members of the Chapter, the cathedral's ruling body. Wells Cathedral clock is famous for its 24-hour astronomical dial and set of jousting knights that perform every quarter-hour. The cathedral has the heaviest ring of ten bells in the world.

Mid-Somerset Hockey Club and Wells City Acorns Hockey Club both play on the Astroturf pitches at the Blue School, where several other sports clubs are based. Wells Leisure Centre has a swimming pool, gymnasium, sports hall, sauna, steam room, relaxation area and solarium. The 18-hole Wells Golf Club is on the outskirts of the city and also has a 24-bay driving range with optional grass tees. In popular culture The Bishop's Palace gatehouse and drawbridge Elizabeth Goudge used Wells as a basis for the fictional cathedral city of Torminster, in her book A City of Bells. Wells has been used as the setting for several films including: The Canterbury Tales (1973), A Fistful of Fingers (1994), The Gathering (2003), The Libertine (2004), The Golden Age (2007), and Hot Fuzz (2007, as Sandford). The cathedral interior stood in for Southwark Cathedral during filming for the Doctor Who episode \\"The Lazarus Experiment\\", and was also used as an interior location in the film Jack the Giant Slayer (2013), and in 2017 for the film Hellboy. In 2017 the market square and town hall was used for production of the BBC series Poldark.

For any given prime number p, a p-adic fraction or p-adic rational is a rational number whose denominator, when the ratio is in minimal (coprime) terms, is a power of p, i.e., a number of the form \\\\frac{a}{p^b} where a is an integer and b is a natural number. These are precisely the numbers possessing a finite base-p positional numeral system expansion. When p = 2, they are called dyadic fractions or dyadic rationals; for example, 1/2 or 3/8, but not 1/3. Arithmetic The sum, product, or difference of any two p-adic rationals is itself another p-adic rational: :\\\\frac{a}{p^b}+\\\\frac{c}{p^d}=\\\\frac{p^{d - \\\\min(b,d)}a + p^{b - \\\\min(b,d)}c} {p^{\\\\max(b,d)} } :\\\\frac{a}{p^b}-\\\\frac{c}{p^d}=\\\\frac{p^{d-b}a-c}{p^d} \\\\quad (d\\\\ge b) :\\\\frac{a}{p^b}-\\\\frac{c}{p^d}=\\\\frac{a-p^{b-d}c}{p^b} \\\\quad (d< b) :\\\\frac{a}{p^b}\\\\times \\\\frac{c}{p^d} = \\\\frac{ a \\\\times c}{p^{b+d}}. However, the result of dividing one p-adic fraction by another is not necessarily a p-adic fraction. Additional properties Because they are closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication, but not division, the p-adic fractions are a ring but not a field. As a ring, the p-adic fractions are a subring of the rational numbers Q, and an overring of the integers Z. Algebraically, this subring is the localization of the integers Z with respect to the set of powers of p. The set of all p-adic fractions is dense in the real line: any real number x can be arbitrarily closely approximated by dyadic rationals of the form \\\\lfloor 2^i x \\\\rfloor / 2^i. Compared to other dense subsets of the real line, such as the rational numbers, the p-adic rationals are in some sense a relatively \\"small\\" dense set, which is why they sometimes occur in proofs. (See for instance Urysohn's lemma for the dyadic rationals.) The p-adic fractions are precisely those numbers possessing finite base-p expansions. Their base-p expansions are not unique; there is one finite and one infinite representation of each p-adic rational other than 0 (ignoring terminal 0s). For example, in binary (p = 2), 0.12 = 0.0111...2 = 1/2. Also, 0.112 = 0.10111...2 = 3/4. Addition modulo 1 forms a group; this is the Pr√ºfer p-group. (This is the same as taking the quotient group of the p-adic rationals by the integers.) Dual group Considering only the addition and subtraction operations of the p-adic rationals gives them the structure of an additive abelian group. The dual group of a group consists of its characters, group homomorphisms to the multiplicative group of the complex numbers, and in the spirit of Pontryagin duality the dual group of the additive p-adic rationals can also be viewed as a topological group. It is called the p-adic solenoid and is an example of a solenoid group and of a protorus. The p-adic rationals are the direct limit of infinite cyclic subgroups of the rational numbers, :\\\\varinjlim \\\\left\\\\\\\\{p^{-i}\\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\mid i = 0, 1, 2, \\\\dots \\\\right\\\\\\\\} and their dual group can be constructed as the inverse limit of the unit circle group under the repeated map :\\\\zeta\\\\mapsto\\\\zeta^p. An element of the p-adic solenoid can be represented as an infinite sequence of complex numbers q0, q1, qp, ..., with the properties that each qi lies on the unit circle and that, for all i > 0, qip = qi ‚àí 1. The group operation on these elements multiplies any two sequences componentwise. Each element of the dyadic solenoid corresponds to a character of the p-adic rationals that maps a/pb to the complex number qba. Conversely, every character œá of the p-adic rationals corresponds to the element of the p-adic solenoid given by qi = œá(1/pi). As a topological space the p-adic solenoid is a solenoid, and an indecomposable continuum.. Related constructions The surreal numbers are generated by an iterated construction principle which starts by generating all finite dyadic fractions, and then goes on to create new and strange kinds of infinite, infinitesimal and other numbers. The binary van der Corput sequence is an equidistributed permutation of the positive dyadic rational numbers. Applications In metrology The inch is customarily subdivided in dyadic rather than decimal fractions; similarly, the customary divisions of the gallon into half-gallons, quarts, and pints are dyadic. The ancient Egyptians also used dyadic fractions in measurement, with denominators up to 64.. In music Time signatures in Western musical notation traditionally consist of dyadic fractions (for example: 2/2, 4/4, 6/8...), although non- dyadic time signatures have been introduced by composers in the twentieth century (for example: 2/, which would literally mean 2/). Non-dyadic time signatures are called irrational in musical terminology, but this usage does not correspond to the irrational numbers of mathematics, because they still consist of ratios of integers. Irrational time signatures in the mathematical sense are very rare, but one example (/1) appears in Conlon Nancarrow's Studies for Player Piano. In computing As a data type used by computers, floating-point numbers are often defined as integers multiplied by positive or negative powers of two, and thus all numbers that can be represented for instance by binary IEEE floating-point datatypes are dyadic rationals. The same is true for the majority of fixed-point datatypes, which also uses powers of two implicitly in the majority of cases.

Within the thymus, Thymus cell lymphocytes or T cells mature. T cells are critical to the adaptive immune system, where the body adapts specifically to foreign invaders. The thymus is located in the upper front part of the chest, in the anterior superior mediastinum, behind the sternum, and in front of the heart. It is made up of two lobes, each consisting of a central medulla and an outer cortex, surrounded by a capsule. The thymus is made up of immature T cells called thymocytes, as well as lining cells called epithelial cells which help the thymocytes develop. T cells that successfully develop react appropriately with MHC immune receptors of the body (called positive selection,) and not against proteins of the body, (called negative selection). The thymus is largest and most active during the neonatal and pre-adolescent periods. By the early teens, the thymus begins to decrease in size and activity and the tissue of the thymus is gradually replaced by fatty tissue. Nevertheless, some T cell development continues throughout adult life. Abnormalities of the thymus can result in a decreased number of T cells and autoimmune diseases such as Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 and myasthenia gravis. These are often associated with cancer of the tissue of the thymus, called thymoma, or tissues arising from immature lymphocytes such as T cells, called lymphoma. Removal of the thymus is called thymectomy. Although the thymus has been identified as a part of the body since the time of the Ancient Greeks, it is only since the 1960s that the function of the thymus in the immune system has become more clear.  Structure  The thymus is an organ that sits beneath the sternum in the upper front part of the chest, stretching upwards towards the neck. In children, the thymus is pinkish-gray, soft, and lobulated on its surfaces. At birth it is about 4‚Äì6 cm long, 2.5‚Äì5 cm wide, and about 1 cm thick. It increases in size until puberty, where it may have a size of about 40‚Äì50 g, following which it decreases in size in a process known as involution. The thymus is made up of two lobes that meet in the upper midline, and stretch from below the thyroid in the neck to as low as the cartilage of the fourth rib. The lobes are covered by a capsule. The thymus lies beneath the sternum, rests on the pericardium, and is separated from the aortic arch and great vessels by a layer of fascia. The left brachiocephalic vein may even be embedded within the thymus. In the neck, it lies on the front and sides of the trachea, behind the sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles. Microanatomy The thymus consists of two lobes, merged in the middle, surrounded by a capsule that extends with blood vessels into the interior. The lobes consist of an outer rich with cells and an inner less dense . The lobes are divided into smaller lobules 0.5-2mm diameter, between which extrude radiating insertions from the capsule along . The cortex is mainly made up of thymocytes and epithelial cells. The thymocytes, immature T cells, are supported by a network of the finely-branched epithelial reticular cells, which is continuous with a similar network in the medulla. This network forms an adventitia to the blood vessels, which enter the cortex via septa near the junction with the medulla. Other cells are also present in the thymus, including macrophages, dendritic cells, and a small amount of B cells, neutrophils and eosinophils. In the medulla, the network of epithelial cells is coarser than in the cortex, and the lymphoid cells are relatively fewer in number. Concentric, nest-like bodies called Hassall's corpuscles (also called thymic corpuscles) are formed by aggregations of the medullary epithelial cells. These are concentric, layered whorls of epithelial cells that increase in number throughout life. They are the remains of the epithelial tubes, which grow out from the third pharyngeal pouches of the embryo to form the thymus. File:Thymus.JPGMicrograph showing a lobule of the thymus. The cortex (deeper purple area) surrounds a less dense and lighter medulla. File:Thymic corpuscle.jpgMicrograph showing a Hassall's corpuscle, found within the medulla of the thymus. Blood and nerve supply The arteries supplying the thymus are branches of the internal thoracic, and inferior thyroid arteries, with branches from the superior thyroid artery sometimes seen. The branches reach the thymus and travel with the septa of the capsule into the area between the cortex and medulla, where they enter the thymus itself; or alternatively directly enter the capsule. The veins of the thymus end in the left brachiocephalic vein, internal thoracic vein, and in the inferior thyroid veins. Sometimes the veins end directly in the superior vena cava. Lymphatic vessels travel only away from the thymus, accompanying the arteries and veins. These drain into the brachiocephalic, tracheobronchial and parasternal lymph nodes. The nerves supplying the thymus arise from the vagus nerve and the cervical sympathetic chain. Branches from the phrenic nerves reach the capsule of the thymus, but do not enter into the thymus itself. Variation The two lobes differ slightly in size, with the left lobe usually higher than the right. Thymic tissue may be found scattered on or around the gland, and occasionally within the thyroid. The thymus in children stretches variably upwards, at times to as high as the thyroid gland. Development Scheme showing development of branchial epithelial bodies from the thoracic cavity of the foetus. I, II, III, IV. Branchial pouches. The thymocytes and the epithelium of the thymus have different developmental origins. The epithelium of the thymus develops first, appearing as two outgrowths, one on either side, of the third pharyngeal pouch. It sometimes also involves the fourth pharyngeal pouch. These extend outward and backward into the surrounding mesoderm and neural crest-derived mesenchyme in front of the ventral aorta. Here the thymocytes and epithelium meet and join with connective tissue. The pharyngeal opening of each diverticulum is soon obliterated, but the neck of the flask persists for some time as a cellular cord. By further proliferation of the cells lining the flask, buds of cells are formed, which become surrounded and isolated by the invading mesoderm. The epithelium forms fine lobules, and develops into a sponge-like structure. During this stage, hematopoietic bone-marrow precursors migrate into the thymus. Normal development is dependent on the interaction between the epithelium and the hematopoietic thymocytes. Iodine is also necessary for thymus development and activity. Involution The thymus continues to grow after the birth reaching the relative maximum size by puberty. It is most active in fetal and neonatal life. It increases to 20 - 50 grams by puberty. It then begins to decrease in size and activity in a process called thymic involution. After the first year of life the amount of T cells produced begins to fall. Fat and connective tissue fills a part of the thymic volume. During involution, the thymus decreases in size and activity. Fat cells are present at birth, but increase in size and number markedly after puberty, invading the gland from the walls between the lobules first, then into the cortex and medulla. This process continues into old age, where whether with a microscope or with the human eye, the thymus may be difficult to detect, although typically weights 5 - 15 grams. The atrophy is due to the increased circulating level of sex hormones, and chemical or physical castration of an adult results in the thymus increasing in size and activity. Severe illness or human immunodeficiency virus infection may also result in involution.  Function  frameless T cell maturation The thymus facilitates the maturation of T cells, an important part of the immune system providing cell- mediated immunity. T cells begin as hematopoietic precursors from the bone- marrow, and migrate to the thymus, where they are referred to as thymocytes. In the thymus they undergo a process of maturation, which involves ensuring the cells react against antigens (\\"positive selection\\"), but that they do not react against antigens found on body tissue (\\"negative selection\\"). Once mature, T cells emigrate from the thymus to provide vital functions in the immune system. Each T cell has a distinct T cell receptor, suited to a specific substance, called an antigen. Most T cell receptors bind to the major histocompatibility complex on cells of the body. The MHC presents an antigen to the T cell receptor, which becomes active if this matches the specific T cell receptor. In order to be properly functional, a mature T cell needs to be able to bind to the MHC molecule (\\"positive selection\\"), and not to react against antigens that are actually from the tissues of body (\\"negative selection\\"). Positive selection occurs in the cortex and negative selection occurs in the medulla of the thymus. After this process T cells that have survived leave the thymus, regulated by sphingosine-1-phosphate. Further maturation occurs in the peripheral circulation. Some of this is because of hormones and cytokines secreted by cells within the thymus, including thymulin, thymopoietin, and thymosins. Positive selection T cells have distinct T cell receptors. These distinct receptors are formed by process of V(D)J recombination gene rearrangement stimulated by RAG1 and RAG2 genes. This process is error-prone, and some thymocytes fail to make functional T-cell receptors, whereas other thymocytes make T-cell receptors that are autoreactive. If a functional T cell receptor is formed, the thymocyte will begin to express simultaneously the cell surface proteins CD4 and CD8. The survival and nature of the T cell then depends on its interaction with surrounding thymic epithelial cells. Here, the T cell receptor interacts with the MHC molecules on the surface of epithelial cells. A T cell with a receptor that doesn't react, or reacts weakly will die by apoptosis. A T cell that does react will survive and proliferate. A mature T cell expresses only CD4 or CD8, but not both. This depends on the strength of binding between the TCR and MHC class 1 or class 2. A T cell receptor that binds mostly to MHC class I tends to produce a mature \\"cytotoxic\\" CD8 positive T cell; a T cell receptor that binds mostly to MHC class II tends to produces a CD4 positive T cell. Negative selection T cells that attack the body's own proteins are eliminated in the thymus, called \\"negative selection\\". Epithelial cells in the medulla and dendritic cells in the thymus express major proteins from elsewhere in the body. The gene that stimulates this is AIRE. Thymocytes that react strongly to self antigens do not survive, and die by apoptosis. Some CD4 positive T cells exposed to self antigens persist as T regulatory cells. Clinical significance Immunodeficiency As the thymus is where T cells develop, congenital problems with the development of the thymus can lead to immunodeficiency, whether because of a problem with the development of the thymus gland, or a problem specific to thymocyte development. Immunodeficiency can be profound. Loss of the thymus at an early age through genetic mutation (as in DiGeorge syndrome, CHARGE syndrome, or a vary rare \\"nude\\" thymus causing absence of hair and the thymus) results in severe immunodeficiency and subsequent high susceptibility to infection by viruses, protozoa, and fungi. Nude mice with the very rare \\"nude\\" deficiency as a result of FOXN1 mutation are a strain of research mice as a model of T cell deficiency. The most common congenital cause of thymus-related immune deficiency results from the deletion of the 22nd chromosome, called DiGeorge syndrome. This results in a failure of development of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches, resulting in failure of development of the thymus, and variable other associated problems, such as congenital heart disease, and abnormalities of mouth (such as cleft palate and cleft lip), failure of development of the parathyroid glands, and the presence of a fistula between the trachea and the oesophagus. Very low numbers of circulating T cells are seen. The condition is diagnosed by fluorescent in situ hybridization and treated with thymus transplantation. Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) are group of rare congenital genetic diseases that can result in combined T, B, and NK cell deficiencies. These syndromes are caused by mutations that affect the maturation of the hematopoietic progenitor cells, which are the precursors of both B and T cells. A number of genetic defects can cause SCID, including IL-2 receptor gene loss of function, and mutation resulting in deficiency of the enzyme adenine deaminase. Autoimmune disease =Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome= Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1, is a rare genetic autoimmune syndrome that results from a genetic defect of the thymus tissues. Specifically, the disease results from defects in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene, which stimulates expression of self antigens in the epithelial cells within the medulla of the thymus. Because of defects in this condition, self antigens are not expressed, resulting in T cells that are not conditioned to tolerate tissues of the body, and may treat them as foreign, stimulating an immune response and resulting in autoimmunity. People with APECED develop an autoimmune disease that affects multiple endocrine tissues, with the commonly affected organs being hypothyroidism of the thyroid gland, Addison's disease of the adrenal glands, and candida infection of body surfaces including the inner lining of the mouth and of the nails due to dysfunction of TH17 cells, and symptoms often beginning in childhood. Many other autoimmune diseases may also occur. Treatment is directed at the affected organs. =Thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity= Thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity can occur in people with thymoma. In this condition, the T cells developed in the thymus are directed against the tissues of the body. This is because the malignant thymus is incapable of appropriately educating developing thymocytes to eliminate self-reactive T cells. The condition is virtually indistinguishable from graft versus host disease. =Myasthenia gravis= Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease most often due to antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors, involved in signalling between nerves and muscles. It is often associated with thymic hyperplasia or thymoma, with antibodies produced probably because of T cells that develop abnormally. Myasthenia gravis most often develops between young and middle age, causing easy fatiguing of muscle movements. Investigations include demonstrating antibodies (such as against acetylcholine receptors or muscle-specific kinase), and CT scan to detect thymoma or thymectomy. With regard to the thymus, removal of the thymus, called thymectomy may be considered as a treatment, particularly if a thymoma is found. Other treatments include increasing the duration of acetylcholine action at nerve synapses by decreasing the rate of breakdown. This is done by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as pyridostigmine. Cancer =Thymomas= Tumours originating from the thymic epithelial cells are called thymomas. They most often occur in adults older than 40. Tumours are generally detected when they cause symptoms, such as a neck mass or affecting nearby structures such as the superior vena cava; detected because of screening in patients with myasthenia gravis, which has a strong association with thymomas and hyperplasia; and detected as an incidental finding on imaging such as chest x-rays. Hyperplasia and tumours originating form the thymus are associated with other autoimmune diseases - such as hypogammaglobulinemia, Graves disease, pure red cell aplasia, pernicious anaemia and dermatomyositis, likely because of defects in negative selection in proliferating T cells. Thymomas can be benign; benign but by virtue of expansion, invading beyond the capsule of the thymus (\\"invasive thyoma\\"), or malignant (a carcinoma). This classification is based on the appearance of the cells. A WHO classification also exists but is not used as part of standard clinical practice. Benign tumours confined to the thymus are most common; followed by locally invasive tumours, and then by carcinomas. There is variation in reporting, with some sources reporting malignant tumours as more common. Invasive tumours, although not technically malignant, can still spread () to other areas of the body. Even though thymomas occur of epithelial cells, they can also contain thymocytes. Treatment of thymomas often requires surgery to remove the entire thymus. This may also result in temporary remission of any associated autoimmune conditions. =Lymphomas= Tumours originating from T cells of the thymus form a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). These are similar in symptoms, investigation approach and management to other forms of ALL. Symptoms that develop, like other forms of ALL, relate to deficiency of platelets, resulting in bruising or bleeding; immunosuppression resulting in infections; or infiltration by cells into parts of the body, resulting in an enlarged liver, spleen, lymph nodes or other sites. Blood test might reveal a large amount of white blood cells or lymphoblasts, and deficiency in other cell lines - such as low platelets or anaemia. Immunophenotyping will reveal cells that are CD3, a protein found on T cells, and help further distinguish the maturity of the T cells. Genetic analysis including karyotyping may reveal specific abnormalities that may influence prognosis or treatment, such as the Philadelphia translocation. Management can include multiple courses of chemotherapy, stem cell transplant, and management of associated problems, such as treatment of infections with antibiotics, and blood transfusions. Very high white cell counts may also require cytoreduction with apheresis. Tumours originating from the small population of B cells present in the thymus lead to primary mediastinal (thymic) large B cell lymphomas. These are a rare subtype of Non-Hodgkins lymphoma, although by the activity of genes and occasionally microscopic shape, unusually they also have the characteristics of Hodgkins lymphomas. that occur most commonly in young and middle-aged, more prominent in females. Most often, when symptoms occur it is because of compression of structures near the thymus, such as the superior vena cava or the upper respiratory tract; when lymph nodes are affected it is often in the mediastinum and neck groups. Such tumours are often detected with a biopsy that is subject to immunohistochemistry. This will show the presence of clusters of differentiation, cell surface proteins - namely CD30, with CD19, CD20 and CD22, and with the absence of CD15. Other markers may also be used to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment usually includes the typical regimens of CHOP or EPOCH or other regimens; regimens generally including cyclophosphamide, an anthracycline, prednisone, and other chemotherapeutics; and potentially also a stem cell transplant. Thymic cysts The thymus may contain cysts, usually less than 4 cm in diameter. Thymic cysts are usually detected incidentally and do not generally cause symptoms. Thymic cysts can occur along the neck or in the chest (mediastinum). Cysts usually just contain fluid and are lined by either many layers of flat cells or column-shaped cells. Despite this, the presence of a cyst can cause problems similar to those of thymomas, by compressing nearby structures, and some may contact internal walls () and be difficult to distinguish from tumours. When cysts are found, investigation may include a workup for tumours, which may include CT or MRI scan of the area the cyst is suspected to be in. Surgical removal Thymectomy is the surgical removal of the thymus. The usual reason for removal is to gain access to the heart for surgery to correct congenital heart defects in the neonatal period. Other indications for thymectomy include the removal of thymomas and the treatment of myasthenia gravis. In neonates the relative size of the thymus obstructs surgical access to the heart and its surrounding vessels. Removal of the thymus in infancy results in often fatal immunodeficiency, because functional T cells have not developed. In older children and adults, which have a functioning lymphatic system with mature T cells also situated in other lymphoid organs, the effect is lesser, and limited to failure to mount immune responses against new antigens. Society and culture When used as food for humans, the thymus of animals is known as one of the kinds of sweetbread. History The thymus was known to the ancient Greeks, and its name comes from the Greek word Œ∏œÖŒºœåœÇ (thumos), meaning \\"anger\\", or \\"heart, soul, desire, life\\", possibly because of its location in the chest, near where emotions are subjectively felt; or else the name comes from the herb thyme (also in Greek Œ∏œçŒºŒøœÇ or Œ∏œÖŒºŒ¨œÅŒπ), which became the name for a \\"warty excrescence\\", possibly due to its resemblance to a bunch of thyme. Galen was the first to note that the size of the organ changed over the duration of a person's life. In the nineteenth century, a condition was identified as status thymicolymphaticus defined by an increase in lymphoid tissue and an enlarged thymus. It was thought to be a cause of sudden infant death syndrome but is now an obsolete term. The importance of the thymus in the immune system was discovered in 1961 by Jacques Miller, by surgically removing the thymus from one day old mice, and observing the subsequent deficiency in a lymphocyte population, subsequently named T cells after the organ of their origin. Until the discovery of its immunological role, the thymus had been dismissed as a \\"evolutionary accident\\", without functional importance. The role the thymus played in ensuring mature T cells tolerated the tissues of the body was uncovered in 1962, with the finding that T cells of a transplanted thymus in mice demonstrated tolerance towards tissues of the donor mouse. B cells and T cells were identified as different types of lymphocytes in 1968, and the fact that T cells required maturation in the thymus was understood. The subtypes of T cells (CD8 and CD4) were identified by 1975. The way that these subclasses of T cells matured - positive selection of cells that functionally bound to MHC receptors - was known by the 1990s. The important role of the AIRE gene, and the role of negative selection in preventing autoreactive T cells from maturing, was understood by 1994. Recently, advances in immunology have allowed the function of the thymus in T-cell maturation to be more fully understood. Other animals The thymus is present in all jawed vertebrates, where it undergoes the same shrinkage with age and plays the same immunological function as in other vertebrates. Recently, a discrete thymus- like lympho-epithelial structure, termed the thymoid, was discovered in the gills of larval lampreys. Hagfish possess a protothymus associated with the pharyngeal velar muscles, which is responsible for a variety of immune responses. The thymus is also present in most other vertebrates with similar structure and function as the human thymus. A second thymus in the neck has been reported sometimes to occur in the mouse As in humans, the guinea pig's thymus naturally atrophies as the animal reaches adulthood, but the athymic hairless guinea pig (which arose from a spontaneous laboratory mutation) possesses no thymic tissue whatsoever, and the organ cavity is replaced with cystic spaces.

It was written mainly by Sophie Wilson. BBC BASIC, based on the older Atom BASIC for the Acorn Atom, extended contemporary microcomputer BASICs with named \`DEF PROC\`/\`DEF FN\` procedures and functions, \`REPEAT UNTIL\` loops, and \`IF THEN ELSE\` structures inspired by COMAL. The interpreter also included statements for controlling the BBC Micro's four-channel sound output and its low-/high-resolution eight-mode graphics display. Due to a number of optimizations, BBC BASIC ran programs much faster than Microsoft BASIC running on similar machines. The optimizations included using multiple linked lists for variable lookup rather than a single long list, pre-defining the location of integer variables, and having separate integer maths routines. Speed was further improved on the BBC machine via the use of fast RAM, which allowed the MOS Technology 6502 processor and Motorola 6845 display driver to share memory without pausing for access. As a result of these design features, BBC BASIC ran David Ahl's Creative Computing Benchmark in 21 seconds, besting even the IBM Personal Computer, and far outpacing most other 8-bit platforms. The only commercial 8-bit BASIC computers that were as fast as the BBC Micro was the Swedish ABC 80 and ABC 800. The improved BASIC 4 on the BBC Master executes the same benchmark in about seven seconds. One of the unique features of BBC BASIC was the inline assembler, allowing users to write assembly language programs for the 6502 and, later, the Zilog Z80, NS32016 and ARM. The assembler was fully integrated into the BASIC interpreter and shared variables with it, which could be included between the [ and ] characters, saved via *SAVE and *LOAD, and called via the CALL or USR commands. This allowed developers to write not just assembly language code, but also BASIC code to emit assembly language, making it possible to use code-generation techniques and even write simple compilers in BASIC. History In 1978 Hermann Hauser and Chris Curry founded Acorn Computers. Much of the code was developed at Cambridge University by Sophie Wilson and her colleagues. Platforms and versions BBC Micro BASIC prompt on the BBC Micro after switch-on or hard reset Complete History available here:BBC BASIC version list BASIC I, the original version, was shipped on early BBC Micros. BASIC II was used on the Acorn Electron and BBC Micros shipped after 1982, including the Model B. It added the \`OPENUP\` and \`OSCLI\` keywords, along with offset assembly and bug fixes. BASIC III, was produced in both a UK version and a United States market version for Acorn's abortive attempt to enter the cross-Atlantic computer market. Apart from a few bug fixes, the only change from BASIC II was that the \`COLOUR\` command could also be spelled \`COLOR\`: regardless of which was input, the UK version always listed it as \`COLOUR\`, the US version as \`COLOR\`. The main place that BASIC III can be found is as the HI-BASIC version for the external second processor. BASIC IV, also known as CMOS BASIC, available on the BBC Master machines, was changed to use the new instructions available in the 65SC12 processor, reducing the size of the code and therefore allowing the inclusion of \`LIST IF\`, \`EXT#\` as a statement, \`EDIT\`, \`TIME$\`, \`ON PROC\`,  in \`VDU\` statements and faster floating point. Bug fixes were again included. BASIC IV(1986) was a further improvement to BASIC IV, and was included on the Master Compact machine. The version of BASIC on the Compact included re-coded mathematical routines, said to provide a 30% speed increase over the version included in the rest of the Master series.Acorn User October 1986 ‚Äî page 17{ ‚Äî Master Compact Review HI-BASIC: this was available in two versions, the first based on BASIC III, and the second based on BASIC IV. Both were built to run from a higher address (&B800;) on the second processor, rather than the usual &8000 address on the BBC B. This allowed more program space to be available on either the external or internal 6502 Second Processors. A version was introduced to support a second Zilog Z80 processor. Another version of BBC BASIC, called BAS128, was supplied on tape and disc with the BBC Master and Master Compact; it loaded into main RAM and used the 64 kB of Sideways RAM for user programs. This provided support for much larger programs at the cost of being a lot slower than the normal ROM-based version. The interpreter can deal with both BASIC and 6502 assembly language, which can be included between the [ and ] characters. This contributed to the system's popularity with industrial and research engineers. =Further details/Determining BASIC version= As the BBC MOS and RISC OS were usually supplied on ROM, it may be assumed that a specific release of the operating system contained a specific version of BASIC. As such, there is no simple way to determine which version of BASIC is actually running other than by enquiring the operating system identity and thus making an assumption. See also BeebWiki entry for INKEY. On the BBC family, it is possible to run both the standard BASIC and an enhanced HIBASIC on the 6502 Second Processor. One may determine if the program is running on the second processor by examining the initial value of PAGE, it will be &800 if using the second processor. To distinguish between BASIC and HIBASIC, one should examine the initial value of HIMEM. This will be &8000 for BASIC running on the second processor, and &B800; for HIBASIC on the second processor. A similar situation exists on RISC OS where there may be the normal BASIC or BASIC64 (which offers higher precision maths). Normal BASIC identifies itself as \\"BASIC V\\" and BASIC64 identifies itself as \\"BASIC VI\\", therefore the following (used before any error has occurred) will distinguish one from the other: IF INSTR(REPORT$,\\"VI\\") THEN PRINT \\"BASIC64\\" ELSE PRINT \\"BASIC\\" There are better ways of doing this, see the BeebWiki. In almost all cases you shouldn't need to be testing for what BASIC or platform your program is running on, just make the call and read whatever returned data is returned and deal with it. Acorn Archimedes (RISC OS) With the move to the 32-bit ARM CPU and the removal of the 16 KB limit on the BASIC code size many new features were added. BASIC V version 1.04 was 61 KB long. Current versions of RISC OS still contain a BBC BASIC V interpreter. The source code to the RISC OS 5 version of BBC BASIC V has been released under the Apache 2.0 license by RISC OS Open.https://gitlab.riscosopen.org/RiscOS/Sources/Programmer/BASIC/-/blob/master/LICENSE In 2011 TBA Software released test versions of an updated BASIC which includes support for VFP/NEON from assembler. Amongst the new commands and features supported were: * \`WHILE-ENDWHILE\` * \`IF-THEN-ELSE-ENDIF\` * \`CASE-OF-WHEN- OTHERWISE-ENDCASE\`, * \`RETURN\` parameters in procedures, * local arrays, * procedure libraries (\`LIBRARY\`,\`INSTALL\` and \`OVERLAY\`), * \`LOCAL DATA\` and \`LOCAL ERROR\` handlers, * a relative \`RESTORE\`, * array operations, * new operators, * \`STEP TRACE\`, * Commands for the new sound system, mouse, graphics. The graphics commands were entirely backwards compatible, the sound less so; for example, the \`ENVELOPE\` keyword from BASIC V onwards is a command that takes fourteen numeric parameters and effectively does nothing‚Äî as in older versions, it calls OS_Word 8, but that does nothing on RISC OS.http://lists.cloud9.co.uk/pipermail/bbc- micro/2006-November/000257.htmlhttp://mdfs.net/Archive/BBCMicro/2006/11/19/185014.htm The in-line 6502 assembler was replaced by an ARM assembler. BASIC V was said, by Acorn, to be \\"certainly the fastest interpreted BASIC in the world\\" and \\"probably the most powerful BASIC found on any computer\\". BASIC VI is a version of BASIC V that supports IEEE 754 8-byte format real numbers, as opposed to the standard 5-byte format introduced in BASIC I. BBC BASIC V and VI were delivered as standard on the Acorn Archimedes and the RiscPC. A version of BBC BASIC V was also available to run on the ARM second processor for the BBC Micro. A compiler for BBC BASIC V was produced by Paul Fellows, team leader of the Arthur OS development, called the Archimedes BASIC Compiler and published initially by DABS Press. ABC was able to implement almost all of the language, with the obvious exception of the EVAL function, which inevitably required run-time programmatic interpretation. As evidence of its completeness, it was able to support in-line assembler syntax. The compiler was written in BBC BASIC V. The compiler (running under the interpreter in the early development stages) was able to compile itself, and versions that were distributed were self-compiled object code. Many applications initially written to run under the interpreter benefitted from the performance boost that this gave, putting BBC BASIC V on a par with other languages for serious application development. Other platforms BBC BASIC has also been ported to many other platforms.BBC BASIC - MDFS::Software.$.BBCBasic A NS32016 version of BBC BASIC was supplied with the Acorn 32016 coprocessor and Acorn ABC. In addition to the version of BBC BASIC supplied with the BBC Micro's Zilog Z80 Second processor, a Z80-based version of BBC BASIC also exists for CP/M-based systems. Until recently, no version existed for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum; however, due to efforts of J. G. Harston (also responsible for a PDP-11 versionBBC BASIC for PDP-11), BBC BASIC for the Spectrum was released in January 2002, with many improvements made in subsequent releases. A Zilog Z80 version of BBC BASIC was also used on the Tiki 100 desktop computer, Cambridge Z88 portable and the Amstrad NC100 Notepad and Amstrad NC200 Notebook computers. This version has been implemented on the TI-83 Plus and TI-84 Plus series graphing calculators. For PC-based systems, BBC BASIC was also implemented for DOS as BBCBASIC (86), which aimed for maximum compatibility with the BBC Micro, and BBasic, which concentrated on the BASIC language, with its own enhancements based on BASIC II. A version of BBC BASIC integrated with the Microsoft Windows graphical user interface, BBC BASIC for Windows created by Richard Russell, developer of the Z80 and x86 versions, was released in 2001. This version is still under active development, seeing much industry use currently. Whilst supporting nearly completely the original BBC BASIC specification (BASIC IV), the Windows version supports much of BASIC V/VI syntax as well as some advanced features of its own. Features unique to BBC BASIC for Windows include interpreter support for record/structure types, and the ability to call Windows API routines or those in an external DLL. Recent versions have included advanced features comparable with languages like C, and an external library has recently added support for objects. An SDL based version of BBC BASIC is available on Windows, Linux and a number of mobile devices supporting the SDL library. A GPL clone of BBC BASIC named Brandy, written in portable C, is also available. An emulator of the BBC Micro for the Commodore Amiga was produced by Ariadne Software for CBM (UK). While extremely fast, it did not emulate the 6502 at full speed, so assembly code would run slower than a real BBC while BASIC programs would run much faster. Due to the way the optimised BASIC and the 6502 emulation interacted, almost no commercial games would run (but well behaved code and educational software generally worked); additionally it used a slightly less precise floating-point numeric format. For a while it was bundled with a special academic package of the Amiga 500, in the hope that schools would replace their ageing BBC Bs with Amiga 500s. BBC Micro publishing house Computer Concepts produced a version of BBC Basic for the Atari ST, named Fast ST BASIC, as a ROM cartridge. A version of BBC BASIC V (Z80) has also been made for the TI-83/84+ Texas Instruments calculator families by Benjamin Ryves. A Commodore 64 version Shado was produced by a small software house Aztec Software in the early 1980s.http://mdfs.net/Software/BBCBasic/C64/ Notes References External links http://www.rtrussell.co.uk/products/ * http://mdfs.net/bbcbasic/ * TI-83+ and TI-84+ implementation of BBC BASIC * The Amstrad NC Users' Site * Ebook programming guide with interfacing methods * BBC BASIC Reference Manual (for RISC OS) * BBC microcomputer User Guide (HTML) * BBC microcomputer User Guide (PDF) * Python code vs BBC Basic for Windows * R.T.

A family may be divided into subfamilies, which are intermediate ranks between the ranks of family and genus. The official family names are Latin in origin; however, popular names are often used: for example, walnut trees and hickory trees belong to the family Juglandaceae, but that family is commonly referred to as being the \\"walnut family\\". What belongs to a family‚Äîor if a described family should be recognized at all‚Äîare proposed and determined by practicing taxonomists. There are no hard rules for describing or recognizing a family. Taxonomists often take different positions about descriptions, and there may be no broad consensus across the scientific community for some time. The publishing of new data and opinions often enables adjustments and consensus. Nomenclature The naming of families is codified by various international bodies using the following suffixes: *In fungal, algal, and botanical nomenclature, the family names of plants, fungi, and algae end with the suffix \\"-aceae\\", with the exception of a small number of historic but widely used names including Compositae and Gramineae. *In zoological nomenclature, the family names of animals end with the suffix \\"-idae\\". History The taxonomic term ' was first used by French botanist Pierre Magnol in his ' (1689) where he called the seventy-six groups of plants he recognised in his tables families ('). The concept of rank at that time was not yet settled, and in the preface to the ' Magnol spoke of uniting his families into larger ', which is far from how the term is used today. Carolus Linnaeus used the word ' in his ' (1751) to denote major groups of plants: trees, herbs, ferns, palms, and so on. He used this term only in the morphological section of the book, discussing the vegetative and generative organs of plants. Subsequently, in French botanical publications, from Michel Adanson's ' (1763) and until the end of the 19th century, the word ' was used as a French equivalent of the Latin ' (or '). In zoology, the family as a rank intermediate between order and genus was introduced by Pierre Andr√© Latreille in his ' (1796). He used families (some of them were not named) in some but not in all his orders of \\"insects\\" (which then included all arthropods). In nineteenth-century works such as the ' of Augustin Pyramus de Candolle and the ' of George Bentham and Joseph Dalton Hooker this word ' was used for what now is given the rank of family.

The whole plant ‚Äì a herbaceous perennial growing from short, thick rhizomes ‚Äì is also called rhubarb. Historically, different plants have been called \\"rhubarb\\" in English. The fleshy, edible stalks (petioles) of other species and hybrids (culinary rhubarb) were cooked and used for food. The large, triangular leaves contain high levels of oxalic acid and anthrone glycosides, making them inedible. The small flowers are grouped in large compound leafy greenish-white to rose-red inflorescences. The precise origin of culinary rhubarb is unknown. The species Rheum rhabarbarum (syn. R. undulatum) and R. rhaponticum were grown in Europe before the 18th century and used for medicinal purposes. By the early 18th century, these two species and a possible hybrid of unknown origin, R. √ó hybridum, were grown as vegetable crops in England and Scandinavia. They readily hybridize, and culinary rhubarb was developed by selecting open-pollinated seed, so that its precise origin is almost impossible to determine. In appearance, samples of culinary rhubarb vary on a continuum between R. rhaponticum and R. rhabarbarum. However, modern rhubarb cultivars are tetraploids with 2n = 44, in contrast to 2n = 22 for the wild species. Although rhubarb is a vegetable, it is often put to the same culinary uses as fruits.Hood, Karen Jean Matsko. (2011). Rhubarb Delights Cookbook: a Collection of Rhubarb Recipes. Spokane Valley, WA: Whispering Pine Press International, Inc. pp. 20, 22. . The leaf stalks can be used raw, when they have a crisp texture (similar to celery, although it is in a different family), but are most commonly cooked with sugar and used in pies, crumbles and other desserts. They have a strong, tart taste. Many cultivars have been developed for human consumption, most of which are recognised as Rheum √ó hybridum by the Royal Horticultural Society. Cultivation Rhubarb displayed for sale at a market in Leeds, England Rhubarb is grown widely, and with greenhouse production it is available throughout much of the year. Rhubarb grown in hothouses (heated greenhouses) is called \\"hothouse rhubarb\\", and is typically made available at consumer markets in early spring, before outdoor cultivated rhubarb is available. Hothouse rhubarb is usually brighter red, tenderer and sweeter-tasting than outdoor rhubarb.Rombauer, Irma S. (1975) Joy of Cooking. Indianapolis/New York: Bobbs-Merrill Co., Inc. p. 142. In temperate climates, rhubarb is one of the first food plants harvested, usually in mid- to late spring (April or May in the Northern Hemisphere, October or November in the Southern Hemisphere), and the season for field-grown plants lasts until the end of summer. In the United Kingdom, the first rhubarb of the year is harvested by candlelight in forcing sheds where all other light is excluded, a practice that produces a sweeter, more tender stalk.McGee, Harold (2004). On Food and Cooking. New York, NY: Scribner. p 367. These sheds are dotted around the \\"Rhubarb Triangle\\" between Wakefield, Leeds, and Morley. In the northwestern US states of Oregon and Washington, there are typically two harvests, from late April to May and from late June into July; half of all US production is in Pierce County, Washington. Rhubarb is ready to consume as soon as harvested, and freshly cut stalks are firm and glossy. Rhubarb damaged by severe cold should not be eaten, as it may be high in oxalic acid, which migrates from the leaves and can cause illness. The colour of rhubarb stalks can vary from the commonly associated crimson red, through speckled light pink, to simply light green. Rhubarb stalks are poetically described as \\"crimson stalks\\". The colour results from the presence of anthocyanins, and varies according to both rhubarb variety and production technique. The colour is not related to its suitability for cooking: Historical cultivation A 19th-century apothecary jar for rhubarb A bundle of rhubarb The Chinese call rhubarb \\"the great yellow\\" (d√† hu√°ng ), and have used rhubarb root for medicinal purposes for thousands of years. It appears in The Divine Farmer's Herb-Root Classic which is thought to have been compiled about 1,800 years ago. Though Dioscurides' description of œÅŒ∑ŒøŒΩ or œÅŒ¨ indicates that a medicinal root brought to Greece from beyond the Bosphorus may have been rhubarb, commerce in the drug did not become securely established until Islamic times. During Islamic times, it was imported along the Silk Road, reaching Europe in the 14th century through the ports of Aleppo and Smyrna, where it became known as \\"Turkish rhubarb\\". Later, it also started arriving via the new maritime routes, or overland through Russia. The \\"Russian rhubarb\\" was the most valued, probably because of the rhubarb-specific quality control system maintained by the Russian Empire. The cost of transportation across Asia made rhubarb expensive in medieval Europe. It was several times the price of other valuable herbs and spices such as cinnamon, opium, and saffron. The merchant explorer Marco Polo therefore searched for the place where the plant was grown and harvested, discovering that it was cultivated in the mountains of Tangut province. The value of rhubarb can be seen in Ruy Gonz√°les de Clavijo's report of his embassy in 1403‚Äì05 to Timur in Samarkand: \\"The best of all merchandise coming to Samarkand was from China: especially silks, satins, musk, rubies, diamonds, pearls, and rhubarb...\\"Quoted in The high price as well as the increasing demand from apothecaries stimulated efforts to cultivate the different species of rhubarb on European soil. Certain species came to be grown in England to produce the roots.A Modern Herbal  Rhubarbs. Botanical.com. Retrieved on 2019-08-17. The local availability of the plants grown for medicinal purposes, together with the increasing abundance and decreasing price of sugar in the 18th century, galvanised its culinary adoption. Grieve claims a date of 1820 in England. Rhubarb was grown in Scotland from at least 1786, having been introduced to the Botanical Garden in Edinburgh by the traveller Bruce of Kinnaird.Grants Old and New Edinburgh Though it is often asserted that rhubarb first came to the United States in the 1820s,Waters, Alice (2002) Chez Panisse Fruit. New York: Harper Collins. p. 278. John Bartram was growing medicinal and culinary rhubarbs in Philadelphia from the 1730s, planting seeds sent to him by Peter Collinson.Fry, Peter (2012-07-20) \\"Did John Bartram introduce rhubarb to North America?\\". Growinghistory.wordpress.com. Retrieved on 2019-08-17.

The Greek physician Dioscorides used the Greek word (), whereas Galen later used (), Latin . These in turn derive from a Persian name for species of Rheum. The specific epithet rhaponticum, applying to one of the presumed parents of the cultivated plant, means 'rha from the region of the Black Sea'. Uses Dried strawberry-flavoured rhubarb Rhubarb is grown primarily for its fleshy leafstalks, technically known as petioles. The use of rhubarb stalks as food is a relatively recent innovation. This usage was first recorded in 18th to 19th-century England after affordable sugar became more widely available. Commonly, it is stewed with sugar or used in pies and desserts, but it can also be put into savoury dishes or pickled. Rhubarb can be dehydrated and infused with fruit juice. In the United States, it is usually infused with strawberry juice to mimic the popular strawberry rhubarb pie. Food A homemade rhubarb pie The species Rheum ribes has been eaten in the Islamic world since the 10th century.Perry, Charles (trans.) An Anonymous Andalusian Cookbook of the 13th Century In Northern Europe and North America the stalks are commonly cut into pieces and stewed with added sugar until soft. The resulting compote, sometimes thickened with corn starch, can then be used in pies, tarts and crumbles. Alternatively, greater quantities of sugar can be added with pectin to make jams. The most popular accompanying spice to use is ginger, although cinnamon and nutmeg are also popular additions. In the United Kingdom, as well as being used in the typical pies, tarts and crumbles, rhubarb compote is also combined with whipped cream and/or custard to make respectively rhubarb fool and rhubarb and custard. In the United States the common usage of rhubarb in pies has led to it being nicknamed ‚Äòpie plant‚Äô, by which it is referred to in many 19th century US cookbooks. Rhubarb in the US is also often paired with strawberries to make strawberry-rhubarb pie, though some rhubarb purists jokingly consider this \\"a rather unhappy marriage\\". In former days, a common and affordable sweet for children in parts of the United Kingdom and Sweden was a tender stick of rhubarb, dipped in sugar. It is still eaten this way in western Finland, Norway, Canada, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Faroe Islands and Sweden, and also some other parts of the world. Rhubarb can also be used to make alcoholic drinks, such as fruit wines or Finnish Rhubarb sima (mead). It is also used to make Kompot.Rhubarb Compote Recipe. epicurious.com Traditional Chinese medicine In traditional Chinese medicine, rhubarb roots of several species were used as a laxative for several millennia, although there is no clinical evidence to indicate such use is effective.Rhubarb James Ford Bell Library University of Minnesota (accessed January 12, 2015) Phytochemistry and potential toxicity The roots and stems contain anthraquinones, such as emodin and rhein. The anthraquinones have been separated from powdered rhubarb root for purposes in traditional medicine, although long-term consumption of the plant has been associated with acute kidney failure. The rhizomes contain stilbenoid compounds (including rhaponticin), and the flavanol glucosides (+)-catechin-5-O-glucoside and (‚àí)-catechin-7-O-glucoside. Oxalic acid Rhubarb leaves contain poisonous substances, including oxalic acid, a nephrotoxin. The long term consumption of oxalic acid leads to kidney stone formation in humans. Humans have been poisoned after ingesting the leaves, a particular problem during World War I when the leaves were mistakenly recommended as a food source in Britain.Cooper, M. R., Johnson, A. W. (1984). Poisonous plants in Britain and their effects on animals and man. Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London, England. Rheum x hybridum, rhubarb. Thepoisongarden.co.uk (2013-11-17). Retrieved on 2019-08-17. The toxic rhubarb leaves have been used in flavouring extracts, after the oxalic acid is removed by treatment with precipitated chalk (i.e., calcium carbonate). The (median lethal dose) for pure oxalic acid in rats is about 375 mg/kg body weight, or about 25 grams for a human. Other sources give a much higher oral LDLo (lowest published lethal dose) of 600 mg/kg. While the oxalic acid content of rhubarb leaves can vary, a typical value is about 0.5%, meaning a 65 kg adult would need to eat 4 to 8 kg (9 to 18 lbs) to obtain a lethal dose, depending on which lethal dose is assumed. Cooking the leaves with baking soda can make them more poisonous by producing soluble oxalates.Everist, Selwyn L. (1974), Poisonous Plants of Australia. Angus and Robertson, Melbourne. p. 583. The leaves are believed to also contain an additional, unidentified toxin, which might be an anthraquinone glycoside (also known as senna glycosides). In the petioles (leaf stalks), the proportion of oxalic acid is about 10% of the total 2‚Äì2.5% acidity, which derives mainly from malic acid. Serious cases of rhubarb poisoning are not well documented. Both fatal and non-fatal cases of rhubarb poisoning may be caused not by oxalates, but rather by toxic anthraquinone glycosides.  Pests  The rhubarb curculio, Lixus concavus, is a weevil. Rhubarb is a host, damage being visible mainly on the leaves and stalks, with gummosis, and oval or circular feeding and/or egg-laying sites. Hungry wildlife may dig up and eat rhubarb roots in the spring, as stored starches are turned to sugars for new foliage growth. References Further reading *Thompson, Fed S.

It consists largely of essays about technology and life experiences, but its major selling point is the inclusion of the incomplete novel on which Adams was working at the time of his death, The Salmon of Doubt (from which the collection gets its title, a reference to the Irish myth of the Salmon of Knowledge). English editions of the book were published in the United States and UK in May 2002, exactly one year after the author's death. Original intention The Salmon of Doubt was originally intended to be a Dirk Gently novel. The plot, set a few weeks after the events in The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul, involves Dirk Gently refusing to help find the missing half of a cat, receiving large amounts of money from an unknown client, and then flying to the United States. Dirk pays a visit to Kate Schechter (who had first appeared in The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul) and tells her that prior to the potential client, he had been so bored that he had started a habit of dialling his own phone number and discovered he'd answered his own calls. A faxed summary reprinted before the text mentions travelling \\"through the nasal membranes of a rhinoceros, to a distant future dominated by estate agents and heavily armed kangaroos.\\" The version in the published book was described as the strongest content from several unfinished drafts that were written. Later intention Adams said that while he originally planned on writing a third Dirk Gently book, the ideas which he had for it would have fit better into another Hitchhiker's book: \\"A lot of the stuff which was originally in The Salmon of Doubt really wasn't working\\", and he planned on \\"salvaging some of the ideas that I couldn't make work in a Dirk Gently framework and putting them in a Hitchhiker framework... and for old time's sake I may call it The Salmon of Doubt.\\" He had expressed dissatisfaction with the fifth Hitchhiker book, Mostly Harmless, saying \\"People have said, quite rightly, that Mostly Harmless is a very bleak book. And it was a bleak book. I would love to finish Hitchhiker on a slightly more upbeat note, so five seems to be a wrong kind of number; six is a better kind of number.\\" Published version The book as published is divided into two main sections: \\"Life, the Universe and Everything\\", which utilizes fiction, essays and interviews with Adams, and The Salmon of Doubt, which presents the most complete version of the novel as Adams left it. The first section is then subdivided into three: \\"Life\\" touches upon Adams' own life, \\"The Universe\\" covers Adams' views of reality and \\"Everything\\", which is more wide open and includes the original version of the Hitchhiker's short story \\"Young Zaphod Plays It Safe\\".

The company produced a number of computers which were especially popular in the UK, including the Acorn Electron and the Acorn Archimedes. Acorn's BBC Micro computer dominated the UK educational computer market during the 1980s. It is more known for its computer than for its other products. Though the company was broken up into several independent operations in 1998, its legacy includes the development of reduced instruction set computing (RISC) personal computers. One of its operating systems, , continues to be developed by RISC OS Open. Some of Acorn's former subsidiaries lived on: ARM Holdings technology is dominant in the mobile phone and personal digital assistant (PDA) microprocessor market. Acorn is sometimes referred to as the \\"British Apple\\"Report on Network Computer Technology . Simon Booth, European Commission, 1999. and has been compared to Fairchild Semiconductor for being a catalyst for start-ups. In 2010, the company was listed by David Meyer in ZDNet as number nine in a feature of top ten \\"Dead IT giants\\". Many British IT professionals gained their early experiences on Acorns, which were often more technically advanced than commercially successful US hardware. History Early history On 25 July 1961, Clive Sinclair founded Sinclair Radionics to develop and sell electronic devices such as calculators. The failure of the Black Watch wristwatch and the calculator market's move from LEDs to LCDs led to financial problems, and Sinclair approached government body the National Enterprise Board (NEB) for help. After losing control of the company to the NEB, Sinclair encouraged Chris Curry to leave Radionics and get Science of Cambridge (SoC‚Äîan early name for Sinclair Research) up and running. In June 1978, SoC launched a microcomputer kit, the Mk 14, that Curry wanted to develop further, but Sinclair could not be persuaded so Curry resigned. During the development of the Mk 14, Hermann Hauser, a friend of Curry's, had been visiting SoC's offices and had grown interested in the product. =CPU Ltd. (1978‚Äì83)= Hermann Hauser and Chris Curry in Cambridge Curry and Hauser decided to pursue their joint interest in microcomputers and, on 5 December 1978, they set up Cambridge Processor Unit Ltd. (CPU) as the vehicle with which to do this. CPU soon obtained a consultancy contract to develop a microprocessor-based controller for a fruit machine for Ace Coin Equipment (ACE) of Wales. The ACE project was started at office space obtained at 4a Market Hill in Cambridge. Initially, the ACE controller was based on a National Semiconductor SC/MP microprocessor, but soon the switch to a MOS Technology 6502 was made. =The microcomputer systems= CPU had financed the development of a SC/MP based microcomputer system using the income from its design-and-build consultancy. This system was launched in January 1979 as the first product of Acorn Computer Ltd., a trading name used by CPU to keep the risks of the two different lines of business separate. The microcomputer kit was named as Acorn System 75. Acorn was chosen because the microcomputer system was to be expandable and growth-oriented. It also had the attraction of appearing before \\"Apple Computer\\" in a telephone directory. March 1979 price list Around this time, CPU and Andy Hopper set up Orbis Ltd. to commercialise the Cambridge Ring networking system Hopper had worked on for his PhD, but it was soon decided to bring him into CPU as a director because he could promote CPU's interests at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. CPU purchased Orbis, and Hopper's Orbis shares were exchanged for shares in CPU Ltd. CPU's role gradually changed as its Acorn brand grew, and soon CPU was simply the holding company and Acorn was responsible for development work. At some point, Curry had a disagreement with Sinclair and formally left Science of Cambridge, but did not join the other Acorn employees at Market Hill until a little while later. The Acorn System 1, upper board; this one was shipped on 9 April 1979. The Acorn Microcomputer, later renamed the Acorn System 1, was designed by Sophie Wilson (then Roger Wilson). It was a semi-professional system aimed at engineering and laboratory users, but its price was low enough, at around GB¬£80, to appeal to the more serious enthusiast as well. It was a very small machine built on two cards, one with an LED display, keypad, and cassette interface (the circuitry to the left of the keypad), and the other with the rest of the computer (including the CPU). Almost all CPU signals were accessible via a Eurocard connector. The System 2 made it easier to expand the system by putting the CPU card from the System 1 in a Eurocard rack that allowed a number of optional additions. The System 2 typically shipped with keyboard controller, external keyboard, a text display interface, and a cassette operating system with built-in BASIC interpreter. The System 3 moved on by adding floppy disk support, and the System 4 by including a larger case with a second drive. The System 5 was largely similar to the System 4, but included a newer 2 MHz version of the 6502. =The Atom= Development of the Sinclair ZX80 started at Science of Cambridge in May 1979. Learning of this probably prompted Curry to conceive the Atom project to target the consumer market. Curry and another designer, Nick Toop, worked from Curry's home in the Fens on the development of this machine. It was at this time that Acorn Computers Ltd. was incorporated and Curry moved to Acorn full-time. It was Curry who wanted to target the consumer market‚Äîother factions within Acorn, including the engineers, were happy to be out of that market, considering a home computer to be a rather frivolous product for a company operating in the laboratory equipment market. To keep costs down and not give the doubters reason to object to the Atom, Curry asked industrial designer Allen Boothroyd to design a case that could also function as an external keyboard for the microcomputer systems. The internals of the System 3 were placed inside the keyboard, creating a quite typical set-up for an inexpensive home computer of the early 1980s‚Äîthe relatively successful Acorn Atom. A Business model called the 'Prophet' was produced at this time. To facilitate software development, a proprietary local area network had been installed at Market Hill. It was decided to include this, the Econet, in the Atom, and at its launch at a computer show in March 1980, eight networked Atoms were demonstrated with functions that allowed files to be shared, screens to be remotely viewed and keyboards to be remotely slaved. =BBC Micro and the Electron= The BBC micro released by Acorn in 1981 After the Atom had been released into the market, Acorn contemplated building modern 16-bit processors to replace the Atom. After a great deal of discussion, Hauser suggested a compromise‚Äîan improved 6502-based machine with far greater expansion capabilities: the Proton. Acorn's technical staff had not wanted to do the Atom and they now saw the Proton as their opportunity to \\"do it right\\".do it right‚Äîquotation from an email from Sophie Wilson. One of the developments proposed for the Proton was the Tube, a proprietary interface allowing a second processor to be added. This compromise would make for an affordable 6502 machine for the mass market which could be expanded with more sophisticated and expensive processors. The Tube enabled processing to be farmed out to the second processor leaving the 6502 to perform data input/output (I/O). The Tube would later be instrumental in the development of Acorn's processor.\\"Should Acorn abandon the 6502 processor which lay at the heart of all its machines? Should the next machine be full of the latest features or should it sacrifice advanced technology for the mass market?\\" In early 1980, the BBC Further Education department conceived the idea of a computer literacy programme, mostly as a follow-up to an ITV documentary, The Mighty Micro, in which Dr Christopher Evans from the UK National Physical Laboratory predicted the coming microcomputer revolution. It was a very influential documentary‚Äîso much so that questions were asked in parliament. As a result of these questions, the Department of Industry (DoI) became interested in the programme, as did BBC Enterprises, which saw an opportunity to sell a machine to go with the series. BBC Engineering was instructed to draw up an objective specification for a computer to accompany the series. Eventually, under some pressure from the DoI to choose a British system, the BBC chose the NewBrain from Newbury Laboratories. This selection revealed the extent of the pressure brought to bear on the supposedly independent BBC's computer literacy project‚ÄîNewbury was owned by the National Enterprise Board, a government agency operating in close collaboration with the DoI. The choice was also somewhat ironic given that the NewBrain started life as a Sinclair Radionics project, and it was Sinclair's preference for developing it over Science of Cambridge's MK14 that led to Curry leaving SoC to found CPU with Hauser. The NEB moved the NewBrain to Newbury after Sinclair left Radionics and went to SoC. In 1980‚Äì82, the British Department of Education and Science (DES) had begun the Microelectronics Education Programme to introduce microprocessing concepts and educational materials. In 1981 through to 1986, the DoI allocated funding to assist UK local education authorities to supply their schools with a range of computers, the BBC Micro being one of the most popular. Schools were offered 50 per cent of the cost of computers, providing they chose one of three models: BBC Micro, ZX Spectrum or Research Machines 380Z. In parallel, the DES continued to fund more materials for the computers, such as software and applied computing projects, plus teacher training. Electron, Acorn's sub-¬£200 competitor to the ZX Spectrum Although the NewBrain was under heavy development by Newbury, it soon became clear that they were not going to be able to produce it‚Äîcertainly not in time for the literacy programme nor to the BBC's specification. The BBC's programmes, initially scheduled for autumn 1981, were moved back to spring 1982. After Curry and Sinclair found out about the BBC's plans, The BBC allowed other manufacturers to submit their proposals. Hauser quickly drafted in Steve Furber (who had been working for Acorn on a voluntary basis since the ACE fruit machine project) and Sophie Wilson to help complete a revised version of the Proton which met the BBC's specifications. BBC visited Acorn and were given a demonstration of the Proton. Shortly afterwards, the literacy programme computer contract was awarded to Acorn, and the Proton was launched in December 1981 as the BBC Micro. In April 1984, Acorn won the Queen's Award for Technology for the BBC Micro. The award paid special tribute to the BBC Micro's advanced design, and it commended Acorn \\"for the development of a microcomputer system with many innovative features\\". Principal creators of the BBC micro in 2008, some 26 years after its release In April 1982, Sinclair launched the ZX Spectrum. Curry conceived of the Electron as Acorn's sub-¬£200 competitor. In many ways, a cut-down BBC Micro, it used one Acorn-designed uncommitted logic array (ULA) to reproduce most of the functionality. But problems in producing the ULAs led to short supply, and the Electron, although launched in August 1983, was not on the market in sufficient numbers to capitalise on the 1983 Christmas sales period. Acorn resolved to avoid this problem in 1984 and negotiated new production contracts. Acorn became more known for its than for its other products. In 2008, the Computer Conservation Society organised an event at London's Science Museum to mark the legacy of the BBC Micro. A number of the BBC Micro's principal creators were present, and Sophie Wilson recounted to the BBC how Hermann Hauser tricked her and Steve Furber to agree to create the physical prototype in less than five days. Also in 2008 a number of former staff organised a reunion event to mark the 30th anniversary of the company's formation. 1983‚Äì1985: Acorn Computer Group The BBC Micro sold well‚Äîso much so that Acorn's profits rose from ¬£3000 in 1979 to ¬£8.6m in July 1983. In September 1983, CPU shares were liquidated and Acorn was floated on the Unlisted Securities Market as Acorn Computer Group plc, with Acorn Computers Ltd. as the microcomputer division. With a minimum tender price of 120p, the group came into existence with a market capitalisation of about ¬£135 million. CPU founders Hermann Hauser and Chris Curry's stakes in the new company were worth ¬£64m and ¬£51m, respectively. =New RISC architecture= Even from the time of the Atom, Acorn were considering how to move on from the 6502 processor: the 16-bit Acorn Communicator developed in 1985, using the 65816 being a key example. The IBM PC was launched on 12 August 1981. Although a version of that machine was aimed at the enthusiast market much like the BBC Micro, its real area of success was business. The successor to the PC, the XT (eXtended Technology) was introduced in early 1983. The success of these machines and the variety of Z80-based CP/M machines in the business sector demonstrated that it was a viable market, especially given that sector's ability to cope with premium prices. The development of a business machine looked like a good idea to Acorn. A development programme was started to create a business computer using Acorn's existing technology‚Äîthe BBC Micro mainboard, the Tube and second processors to give CP/M, MS-DOS and Unix (Xenix) workstations. This Acorn Business Computer (ABC) plan required a number of second processors to be made to work with the BBC Micro platform. In developing these, Acorn had to implement the Tube protocols on each processor chosen, in the process finding out, during 1983, that there were no obvious candidates to replace the 6502. Because of many-cycle uninterruptible instructions, for example, the interrupt response times of the Motorola 68000 were too slow to handle the communication protocol that the host 6502-based BBC Micro coped with easily. The National Semiconductor 32016-based model of the ABC range, was developed and later sold in 1985 as the Cambridge Workstation (using the Panos operating system). Advertising for this machine in 1986 included an illustration of an office worker using the workstation. The advert claimed mainframe power at a price of ¬£3,480 (excluding VAT). The main text of the advertisement referred to available mainframe languages, communication capabilities and the alternative option of upgrading a BBC Micro using a coprocessor. The machine had shown Sophie Wilson and Steve Furber the value of memory bandwidth. It also showed that an 8 MHz 32016 was completely trounced in performance terms by a 4 MHz 6502. Furthermore, the Apple Lisa had shown the Acorn engineers that they needed to develop a windowing system‚Äîand this was not going to be easy with a 2‚Äì4 MHz 6502-based system doing the graphics. Acorn would need a new architecture. Cambridge Workstation advert in New Scientist, 24 April 1986 issue Acorn had investigated all of the readily available processors and found them wanting or unavailable to them. After testing all of the available processors and finding them lacking, Acorn decided that it needed a new architecture. Inspired by white papers on the Berkeley RISC project, Acorn seriously considered designing its own processor. A visit to the Western Design Center in Phoenix, where the 6502 was being updated by what was effectively a single-person company, showed Acorn engineers Steve Furber and Sophie Wilson they did not need massive resources and state-of-the-art research and development facilities. Sophie Wilson set about developing the instruction set, writing a simulation of the processor in BBC Basic that ran on a BBC Micro with a 6502 second processor. It convinced the Acorn engineers that they were on the right track. Before they could go any further, however, they would need more resources. It was time for Wilson to approach Hauser and explain what was afoot. Once the go-ahead had been given, a small team was put together to implement Wilson's model in hardware. Advert in New Scientist, 31 July 1986 issue The official Acorn RISC Machine project started in October 1983, with Acorn spending on it by 1987. VLSI Technology, Inc were chosen as silicon partner, since they already supplied Acorn with ROMs and some custom chips. VLSI produced the first ARM silicon on 26 April 1985‚Äîit worked first time and came to be known as ARM1. Its first practical application was as a second processor to the BBC Micro, where it was used to develop the simulation software to finish work on the support chips (VIDC, IOC, MEMC) and to speed up the operation of the CAD software used in developing ARM2. The ARM evaluation system was promoted as a means for developers to try the system for themselves. This system was used with a BBC Micro and a PC compatible version was also planned. Advertising was aimed at those with technical expertise, rather than consumers and the education market, with a number of technical specifications listed in the main text of the adverts. Wilson subsequently coded BBC Basic in ARM assembly language, and the in-depth knowledge obtained from designing the instruction set allowed the code to be very dense, making ARM BBC Basic an extremely good test for any ARM emulator. Such was the secrecy surrounding the ARM CPU project that when Olivetti were negotiating to take a controlling share of Acorn in 1985, they were not told about the development team until after the negotiations had been finalised. In 1992, Acorn once more won the Queen's Award for Technology for the ARM. Acorn's development of their operating system required around 200 OS development staff at its peak. Acorn C/C++ was released commercially by Acorn, for developers to use to compile their own applications. =Financial problems= Acorn's watershed year was 1984‚Äîit had gone public just as demand for its home computer products collapsed. It was the year when Atari was sold, Apple nearly went bankrupt, and Acorn had solved ongoing issue of production volumes. The Electron had been launched in 1983, but problems with the supply of its ULAs meant that Acorn was not able to capitalise on the 1983 Christmas selling periodChris's Acorns Acorn Electron - Release and ULA supply issues.‚Äîa successful advertising campaign, including TV advertisements, had led to 300,000 orders, but the Malaysian suppliers were only able to supply 30,000 machines. The apparently strong demand for Electrons proved to be ephemeral: rather than wait, parents bought Commodore 64s or ZX Spectrums for their children's presents. Ferranti solved the production problem and in 1984, production reached its anticipated volumes, but the contracts Acorn had negotiated with its suppliers were not flexible enough to allow volumes to be reduced quickly in this unanticipated situation‚Äîsupplies of the Electron built up. At the time of the eventual financial rescue of Acorn in early 1985, it still had 100,000 unsold Electrons on its hands plus components which had all been paid for and needed to be stored‚Äîat additional expense. Acorn was also spending a large portion of its reserves on development: the BBC Master was being developed; the ARM project was underway; the Acorn Business Computer entailed a lot of development work but ultimately proved to be something of a flop, with only the 32016-based version ever being sold (as the Cambridge Workstation); and obtaining Federal approval for the BBC Micro in order to expand into the United States proved to be a drawn-out and expensive process that proved futile‚Äîall of the expansion devices that were intended to be sold with the BBC Micro had to be tested and radiation emissions had to be reduced. Around $20m was sunk into the U.S. operation, but the NTSC-modified BBC Micros sold barely at all. They did, however, make an appearance in the school of Supergirl in the 1984 film Supergirl: The Movie. 1985‚Äì1998: Olivetti subsidiary The dire financial situation was brought to a head in February 1985, when one of Acorn's creditors issued a winding-up petition. After a short period of negotiations, Curry and Hauser signed an agreement with Olivetti on 20 February. The Italian computer company took a 49.3% stake in Acorn for ¬£12 million, which went some way to covering Acorn's ¬£11 million losses in the previous six months.Centre for Computing History Olivetti buy 49% of Acorn This valuation fell some ¬£165m below Acorn's peak valuation of ¬£190m. In September 1985, Olivetti took a controlling share of Acorn with 79% of shares. (In July 1996, Olivetti announced that it had sold 14.7% of the group to Lehman Brothers reducing its stake at that time to 31.2%. Lehman said it planned to resell the shares to investors.) Towards the end of 1985, Acorn unveiled a new OEM-focused computer named the Communicator. This was Acorn's answer to ICL's 'One Per Desk' initiative. This Acorn machine was based around a 16-bit 65SC816 CPU, 128 KB RAM, expandable to 512 KB, plus additional battery-backed RAM. It had a new multi-tasking OS, had 4x internal ROM sockets, and shipped with 'View' based software. It also had an attached telephone, communications software and auto-answer/auto-dial modem.Communicator details Communicator details In February 1986, Acorn announced that it was ceasing US sales operations, and sold its remaining US BBC Microcomputers for $1.25M to a Texas company, 'Basic', which was a subsidiary of Datum, the Mexican manufacturer of the Spanish version of the BBC Microcomputer (with modified Spanish keyboards for the South American market). The Woburn, Mass. sales office was closed at this time.Acorn User - News section- Feb 1986 =BBC Master and Archimedes= Reader reply card in New Scientist, 9 September 1989 issue The BBC MasterChris's Acorns - Master 128 Master 128 was launched in February 1986 and met with great success. From 1986 to 1989, about 200,000 systems were sold, each costing ¬£499, mainly to UK schools and universities. A number of enhanced versions were launched‚Äîfor example, the Master 512,Chris's Acorns - Master 512 Master 512 which had 512 KB of RAM and an internal 80186 processor for MS-DOS compatibility, and the Master Turbo,Chris's Acorns - Master Turbo Master Turbo which had a 65C102 second processor. The first commercial use of the ARM architecture was in the ARM Development System, a Tube-linked second processor for the BBC Master which allowed one to write programs for the new system. It sold for ¬£4,500 and included the ARM processor, 4 MB of RAM and a set of development tools with an enhanced version of BBC BASIC. This system did not include the three support chips‚ÄîVIDC, MEMC, and IOC‚Äîwhich were later to form part of the Archimedes system. They made their first appearance in the A500 second processor, which was used internally within Acorn as a development platform, and had a similar form-factor to the ARM development system. The second ARM-based product was the Acorn Archimedes desktop-computer, released in mid-1987, some 18 months after IBM launched their RISC-based RT PC. The first RISC-based home computer, the Archimedes was popular in the United Kingdom, Australasia and Ireland, and was considerably more powerful and advanced than most offerings of the day. The Archimedes was advertised in both printed and broadcast media. One example of such advertising is a mock-up of the RISC OS 2 desktop, showing some software application directories, with the advert text added within windows. However, the vast majority of home users opted for an Atari ST or Commodore Amiga when looking to upgrade their 8-bit micros. As with the BBC, the Archimedes instead flourished in schools and other educational settings but just a few years later in the early 1990s this market began stratifying into the PC-dominated world. Acorn continued to produce updated models of the Archimedes including a laptop (the A4) and in 1994 launched the Risc PC, whose top specification would later include a 200 MHz+ StrongARM processor. These were sold mainly into education, specialist and enthusiast markets. =ARM Ltd.= Acorn's silicon partner, VLSI, had been given the task of finding new applications for the ARM CPU and support chips. Hauser's Active Book company had been developing a handheld device and for this the ARM CPU developers had created a static version of their processor, the ARM2aS. Members of Apple's Advanced Technology Group (ATG) had made initial contact with Acorn over use of the ARM in an experimental Apple II (2) style prototype called M√∂bius. Experiments done in the M√∂bius project proved that the ARM RISC architecture could be highly attractive for certain types of future products. The M√∂bius project was briefly considered as the basis for a new line of Apple computers but was killed for fear it would compete with the Macintosh and confuse the market. However, the M√∂bius project evolved awareness of the ARM processor within Apple. The M√∂bius Team made minor changes to the ARM registers, and used their working prototype to demonstrate a variety of impressive performance benchmarks.The RISC for the Rest of Us , Art Sobel, in Advanced RISC Technology (ART), 1996. ARM Evangelist. Later Apple was developing an entirely new computing platform for its Newton. Various requirements had been set for the processor in terms of power consumption, cost and performance, and there was also a need for fully static operation in which the clock could be stopped at any time. Only the Acorn RISC Machine came close to meeting all these demands, but there were still deficiencies. The ARM did not, for example, have an integral memory management unit, as this function was being provided by the MEMC support chip and Acorn did not have the resources to develop one.Low power hardware for a high performance PDA, M. Culbert, in Low Power Electronics, 1994. Digest of Technical Papers., IEEE Symposium, 1994. Apple and Acorn began to collaborate on developing the ARM, and it was decided that this would be best achieved by a separate company. The bulk of the Advanced Research and Development section of Acorn that had developed the ARM CPU formed the basis of ARM Ltd. when that company was spun off in November 1990.

Essentially a rebadged OEM version of the Series 3 with slightly different on-board software, the device was marketed as an inexpensive computer for schoolchildren, rather than as an executive tool.Chris's Acorns: Acorn Pocket Book . Acorn.chriswhy.co.uk (2008-01-16). Retrieved on 2013-12-08. The hardware was the same as the Series 3, but the integrated applications were different; for instance, the Pocket Book omitted the Agenda diary and Spell dictionary applications, which became an optional application, supplied on ROM SSD which could be inserted into either of the ROM bays underneath the device. Other programs were renamed: 'System' became 'Desktop', 'Word' became 'Write', 'Sheet' became 'Abacus' and 'Data' became 'Cards'. =Set-top boxes= In 1994, a subsidiary of Acorn, Online Media, was founded. Online Media aimed to exploit the projected video- on-demand (VOD) boom, an interactive television system which would allow users to select and watch video content over a network. In September 1994 the Cambridge Digital Interactive Television Trial of video-on-demand services was set up by Online Media, Anglia Television, Cambridge Cable (now part of Virgin Media) and Advanced Telecommunication Modules Ltd (ATML)ARM7500 Press Release , Advanced RISC Machines Ltd press release, 18 October 1994‚Äîthe trial involved creating a wide area ATM network linking TV-company to subscribers' homes and delivering services such as home shopping, online education, software downloaded on-demand and the World Wide Web.

For the first six months the trial involved 10 VOD terminals; the second phase was expanded to cover 100 homes and eight schools with a further 150 terminals in test labs. A number of other organisations gradually joined in, including the National Westminster Bank, the BBC, the Post Office, Tesco and the local education authority. BBC Education tested delivery of radio-on-demand programmes to primary schools, and a new educational service, Education Online, was established to deliver material such as Open University television programmes and educational software. Netherhall School was provided with an inexpensive video server and operated as a provider of trial services, with Anglia Polytechnic University taking up a similar role some time later. It was hoped that Online Media could be floated as a separate company, and a share issue raising additional capital for the division was announced in 1995, but the predicted video-on-demand boom never really materialised. =NewsPad= Risc User: NewsPad ‚Äì Covered in the October 1996 edition In 1994, the EU initiated the NewsPad program, with the aim of developing a common mechanism to author and deliver news electronically to consumer devices. The program's name and format were inspired by the devices described and depicted in Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film: 2001: A Space Odyssey. Acorn won a contract to develop a consumer device / receiver, and duly supplied a RISC OS based touch-screen tablet computer for the pilot.http://adrenaline.ucsd.edu/onr/annotation%20devices.html#newspad Annotation devices The device measured and was being tried in 1996 in Spain by Ediciones Primera Plana.

This upset other suppliers and members of the National Association of Advisers for Computers in Education (NAACE). =Network computers= Wired UK, September 1996 issue, Five Go Nuts in Cambridge: Acorn's mad rush to build the world's first Network Computer When BBC2's The Money Programme screened an interview with Larry Ellison in October 1995, Acorn Online Media Managing Director Malcolm Bird realised that Ellison's network computer was, basically, an Acorn set-top box.Five Go Nuts in Cambridge , Wired UK magazine 2.09, September 1996 After initial discussions between Oracle Corporation and Olivetti, Hauser and Acorn a few weeks later, Bird was dispatched to San Francisco with Acorn's latest Set Top Box. The design of this set top box and its software was the original property of Viewcall PLC a company founded initially in the UK by John Bentley a well known British entrepreneur who had made his fortune in the media business and in video rental. He founded Viewcall PLC in 1993 to create the world's first low cost slim client STB for Internet TV by scaling down an Acorn PC and using an ARM Risc chip (then almost unknown). Work was conducted under a secrecy agreememt with Acorn and in 1995 Viewcall PLC exhibited the world's first fully functioning Internet TV at the Cafe Royal in London to an audience of 200 investors at which Malcolm Bird was present as a representative of Acorn which company Viewcall had contracted to produce the STB to the Viewcall design. Under a one year agreement with Acorn ending on 31/12/1995 Viewcall had ordered 1,000 of its own design STB's and over two years had separately developed the software which was vital essential for adaption of a PC unit to a television screen. Delays occurred in the delivery of the 1,000 units from Acorn to Viewcall as per its agreement with Acorn which seriously delayed the business of Viewcall in its aim of being the sole world vendor of Internet TV units to enter the consumer market place, no other competitor being known at the time. Despite this delay Viewcall exhibited its STB at the CES exhibition in January 1996 where it was publicly reviewed and acclaimed in the CES journal by the journalist and inventor of the Ethernet as the world's first Intervision -as he named it- or Internet Television. This was believed to be prior to Acorn and Oracle's public claim that they had developed such a device. Oracle formed a new company NetChannel with directors Malcolm Bird and Herman Hauser which then financed a rival unit to that of Viewcall which had transferred it business licence for USA manufacture to Viewcall America Inc. Due to the competition from NetChannel and its powerful majority owner Oracle Corporation it became impossible to attract interest in Viewcall's almost identical product excepting that Viewcall's software was fully functioning. Consequently NetChannel made an offer for the business of Viewcall America by which it obtained ownership of the Viewcall designs and software. Viewcall then ceased its business as the original creator of Internet TV and the world's first thin client using only a distant server, effectively a forerunner to the later Cloud concept. To view the links to various media which confirm the veracity of Viewcall's Internet STB as a world first ‚Äì see www.johnbentley.biz Oracle had already talked seriously with computer manufacturers including Sun and Apple about the contract for putting together the NC blueprint machine; there were also rumours in the industry that said Oracle itself was working on the reference design. After Bird's visit to Oracle, Ellison visited Acorn and a deal was reached: Acorn would define the NC Reference Standard. The date at which Bird and Herman Hauser visited Acorn to discuss their joint business is believed to be on 3 January 1996 -two days after the Confidentiality Agreement with Viewcall expired. Had discussions of any description started prior to 1 January 1996 the Confidentiality Agreement would have been broken by Acorn. Ellison was expecting to announce the NC in February 1996. Sophie Wilson was put in charge of the NC project, and by mid-November a draft NC specification was ready. By January 1996 the formal details of the contract between Acorn and Oracle had been worked out, and the PCB was designed and ready to be put into production. In February 1996 Acorn Network Computing was founded. In August 1996 it launched the Acorn Network Computer. An Acorn NetStation NC It was hoped that the Network Computer would create a significant new sector in which Acorn Network Computing would be a major player, either selling its own products or earning money from licence fees paid by other manufacturers for the right to produce their own NCs. To that end, two of Acorn's major projects were the creation of a new 'consumer device' operating system, Galileo and, in conjunction with Digital Semiconductor and ARM, a new StrongARM chipset consisting of the SA-1500 and SA-1501. Galileo's main feature was a guarantee of a certain quality of service to each process in which the resources (CPU, memory, etc.) required to ensure reliable operation would be kept available regardless of the behaviour of other processes.Acorn Looks to the Stars With New Galileo Operating System , Acorn Computer Group press release, 10 February 1997 The SA-1500 sported higher clock rates than existing StrongARM CPUs and, more importantly, a media-focussed coprocessor (the Attached Media Processor or AMP). The SA-1500 was to be the first release target for Galileo. After having incorporated its STB and NC business areas as separate companies, Acorn created a new wholly owned subsidiary, Acorn RISC Technologies (ART). ART focused on the development of other software and hardware technologies built on top of ARM processors. 1998‚Äì2000: Element 14 The distinctive yellow case of the Acorn Phoebe During the first half of 1998 Acorn's management were heavily involved in the initial public offering of ARM Holdings plc which raised ¬£18 million for Acorn throughout 1998. In June 1998, Stan Boland took over as CEO of Acorn Computers from David Lee who started a review of Acorn's core business. The company had losses of ¬£9 million in the first nine months of the year and in September 1998 the results of the review led to a significant restructuring of the company. The Workstation division was to close, a forty percent reduction in staff and the Risc PC 2 code-named Phoebe that was nearing completion was cancelled. These actions allowed the company to reduce on-going losses and focus on other activities. Acorn concentrated on development of digital TV set-top boxes and high performance media centric DSP (silicon and software). It also produced a reference design for a Windows NT thin client using a Cirrus Logic system on a chip. To concentrate on these two activities Acorn hired a group of former STMicroelectronics silicon-design engineers and they formed the basis of a silicon-design centre that Acorn set up in Bristol. They also started to dispose of some of their interests in the former workstation market. It was reported that Stephen Streater of Eidos may have made a ¬£0.5M bid for the rights to the PC range. In October they granted distribution rights to the existing designs of machines to Castle Technology to supply the former Workstation market's dealer network, sold their 50% interest in Xemplar Education to Apple Computer in Jan 1999, and in March 1999, RISCOS Ltd acquired a licence to develop and release RISC OS. By January 1999, Acorn Computers Ltd. had renamed to Element 14 Limited (though still owned by Acorn Group plc), this change was to reflect the changed nature of the business and to distance itself from the education market that Acorn Computers was most known for. Other names had been considered by the company, but the website e-14.com had been registered before the official announcement. Legacy The legacy of the company's work is evidenced in spin-off technologies, with the company being described in 2013 as \\"the most influential business in the innovation cluster's history\\". Revival of the Acorn trademark In early 2006, the dormant Acorn trademark was licensed from the French company, Aristide & Co Antiquaire De Marques, by a new company based in Nottingham. This company was dissolved in late 2009. On 23 February 2018 the Acorn trademark made another return when a new company Acorn Inc. Ltd announced a brand new smartphone, the Acorn Micro C5. The Acorn Micro C5 has since been discontinued. Popular culture In 2009, BBC4 screened Micro Men, a drama based on the rivalry between Acorn Computers and Sinclair's competing machines.

These conditions, or impairments, may be cognitive, developmental, intellectual, mental, physical, sensory, or a combination of multiple factors. Impairments causing disability may be present from birth or occur during a person's lifetime. The World Health Organization proposes the following definition of disabilities: Disability is a contested concept, with different meanings in different communities. The term disability may refer to physical or mental attributes that some institutions, particularly medicine, view as needing to be fixed (the medical model); it may also refer to limitations imposed on people by the constraints of an ableist society (the social model); or the term may serve to refer to the identity of disabled people. Physiological functional capacity (PFC) is a measure of an individual's performance level that gauges one's ability to perform the physical tasks of daily life and the ease with which these tasks are performed. PFC declines with advancing age to result in frailty, cognitive disorders, or physical disorders, all of which may lead to labeling individuals as disabled.  Terminology  ; Handicap:The term handicap derives from the medieval game Hand-in-cap, in which two players trade possessions and a third, neutral person judges the difference of value between the possessions. The concept of a neutral person evening up the odds was extended to handicap racing in the mid-18th century, where horses carry different weights based on the umpire's estimation of what would make them run equally. In the early 20th century the word gained the additional meaning of describing a disability, in the sense that a person with a handicap was carrying a heavier burden than normal. ; Access: The ability to go places and do things. People with certain types of disabilities struggle to get equal access to some things in society. For example, a blind person cannot read printed paper voting ballots, and therefore does not have access to voting that requires paper ballots. ; Accommodation: A change that improves access. For example, if voting ballots are available in Braille or on a text-to-speech machine, or if another person reads the ballot to the blind person and recorded the choices, then the blind person would have access to voting.  Causes  There are many different causes of disability that often affect basic activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing, transferring, and maintaining personal hygiene; or advanced activities of daily living such as shopping, food preparation, driving, or working. For the purposes of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regulations provide a list of conditions that should easily be concluded to be disabilities: deafness, blindness, an intellectual disability (formerly termed mental retardation), partially or completely missing limbs or mobility impairments requiring the use of a wheelchair, autism, cancer, cerebral palsy, diabetes, epilepsy, HIV/AIDS, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia. This is not an exhaustive list and many injuries and medical problems cause disability. Some causes of disability, such as injuries, may resolve over time and are considered temporary disabilities. An acquired disability is the result of impairments that occur suddenly or chronically during the lifespan, as opposed to being born with the impairment. Invisible disabilities may not be obviously noticeable.  History  Contemporary understandings of disability derive from concepts that arose during the West's scientific Enlightenment; prior to the Enlightenment, physical differences were viewed through a different lens. There is evidence of humans during prehistory that looked after people with disabilities. At the Windover Archeological Site, one of the skeletons that was found was a male about 15 years old, who had spina bifida. The condition meant that the boy, probably paralyzed below the waist, was taken care of in a Hunter-gatherer community. Provision that enabled individuals with impaired mobility to access temples and healing sanctuaries were made in ancient Greece..Specifically, by 370 B.C., at the most important healing sanctuary in the wider area, the Sanctuary of Asclepius at Epidaurus, there were at least 11 permanent stone ramps that provided access to mobility-impaired visitors to nine different structures; evidence that people with disabilities were acknowledged and cared for, at least partly, in ancient Greece. During the Middle Ages, madness and other conditions were thought to be caused by demons. They were also thought to be part of the natural order, especially during and in the fallout of the Plague, which wrought impairments throughout the general population.Braddock, David, and Susan Parrish, \\"An Institutional History of Disability,\\" in Handbook of Disability Studies, ed. Gary Albrecht, Katherine Seelman, and Michael Bury (Thousand Oaks, Calif.: Sage, 2001). In the early modern period there was a shift to seeking biological causes for physical and mental differences, as well as heightened interest in demarcating categories: for example, Ambroise Pare, in the sixteenth century, wrote of \\"monsters\\", \\"prodigies\\", and \\"the maimed\\". The European Enlightenment's emphases on knowledge derived from reason and on the value of natural science to human progress helped spawn the birth of institutions and associated knowledge systems that observed and categorized human beings; among these, the ones significant to the development of today's concepts of disability were asylums, clinics, and, prisons. Contemporary concepts of disability are rooted in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century developments. Foremost among these was the development of clinical medical discourse, which made the human body visible as a thing to be manipulated, studied, and transformed. These worked in tandem with scientific discourses that sought to classify and categorize and, in so doing, became methods of normalization. The concept of the \\"norm\\" developed in this time period, and is signaled in the work of the Belgian statistician, sociologist, mathematician, and astronomer Adolphe Quetelet, who wrote in the 1830s of l'homme moyen ‚Äì the average man. Quetelet postulated that one could take the sum of all people's attributes in a given population (such as their height or weight) and find their average and that this figure should serve as a norm toward which all should aspire. This idea of statistical norm threads through the rapid take-up of statistics gathering by Britain, the United States, and the Western European states during this time period, and it is tied to the rise of eugenics. Disability, as well as other concepts including: abnormal, non-normal, and normalcy came from this.Davis, Lennard. \\"Constructing Normalcy.\\" In his Enforcing Normalcy: Disability, Deafness, and the Body (New York: Verso, 1995), pp. 23‚Äì49. The circulation of these concepts is evident in the popularity of the freak show, where showmen profited from exhibiting people who deviated from those norms. With the rise of eugenics in the latter part of the nineteenth century, such deviations were viewed as dangerous to the health of entire populations. With disability viewed as part of a person's biological make-up and thus their genetic inheritance, scientists turned their attention to notions of weeding such as \\"deviations\\" out of the gene pool. Various metrics for assessing a person's genetic fitness, which was then used to deport, sterilize, or institutionalize those deemed unfit. At the end of the Second World War, with the example of Nazi eugenics, eugenics faded from public discourse, and increasingly disability cohered into a set of attributes that medicine could attend to ‚Äì whether through augmentation, rehabilitation, or treatment. In both contemporary and modern history, disability was often viewed as a by-product of incest between first-degree relatives or second-degree relatives. In the early 1970s, disability activists began to challenge how society treated disabled people and the medical approach to disability. Due to this work, physical barriers to access were identified. These conditions functionally disabled them, and what is now known as the social model of disability emerged. Coined by Mike Oliver in 1983, this phrase distinguishes between the medical model of disability ‚Äì under which an impairment needs to be fixed ‚Äì and the social model of disability ‚Äì under which the society that limits a person needs to be fixed.Shakespeare, Tom. \\"The Social Model of Disability.\\" In The Disability Studies Reader, ed. Lennard Davis (New York: Routledge, 2006, 2d ed.), 197‚Äì204.  Sociology  Museum of disABILITY History, Buffalo, New York  People-first language  People-first language is one way to talk about disability that some people prefer. Many others prefer identity-first language. Using people-first language is said to put the person before the disability, so those individuals who prefer people-first language, prefer to be called, \\"a person with a disability\\". This style is reflected in major legislation on disability rights, including the Americans with Disabilities Act and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. For people-first guidelines, check out, \\"Cerebral Palsy: A Guide for Care\\" at the University of Delaware: > \\"The American Psychological Association style guide states that, when > identifying a person with a disability, the person's name or pronoun should > come first, and descriptions of the disability should be used so that the > disability is identified, but is not modifying the person. Acceptable > examples included \\"a woman with Down syndrome\\" or \\"a man who has > schizophrenia\\". It also states that a person's adaptive equipment should be > described functionally as something that assists a person, not as something > that limits a person, for example, \\"a woman who uses a wheelchair\\" rather > than \\"a woman in/confined to a wheelchair\\". A similar kind of \\"people-first\\" terminology is also used in the UK, but more often in the form \\"people with impairments\\" (such as \\"people with visual impairments\\"). However, in the UK, identity-first language is generally preferred over people-first language. The use of ‚Äúpeople-first‚Äù terminology has given rise to the use of the acronym PWD to refer to person(s) (or people) with disabilities (or disability). However other individuals and groups prefer identity-first language to emphasize how a disability can impact people's identities. Which style of language used varies between different countries, groups and individuals.  Identity-first language  In contrast to people- first language, identity-first language describes the person as \\"disabled\\". Some people prefer this and argue that this fits the social model even better than does people-first language, as it emphasizes that the person is disabled not by their body, but by a world that does not accommodate them. This is especially true in the UK, where it is argued under the social model that while someone's impairment (for example, having a spinal cord injury) is an individual property, \\"disability\\" is something created by external societal factors such as a lack of accessibility.Glasgow Centre for Inclusive Living: The Social Model of Disability This distinction between the individual property of impairment and the social property of disability is central to the social model. The term \\"disabled people\\" as a political construction is also widely used by international organizations of disabled people, such as Disabled Peoples' International (DPI). Using the identity-first language also parallels how people talk about other aspects of identity and diversity. For example: > ‚ÄúIn the autism community, many self-advocates and their allies prefer > terminology such as ‚ÄòAutistic,‚Äô ‚ÄòAutistic person,‚Äô or ‚ÄòAutistic individual‚Äô > because we understand autism as an inherent part of an individual‚Äôs identity > ‚Äî the same way one refers to ‚ÄòMuslims,‚Äô ‚ÄòAfrican-Americans,‚Äô > ‚ÄòLesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Transgender/Queer,‚Äô ‚ÄòChinese,‚Äô ‚Äògifted,‚Äô ‚Äòathletic,‚Äô > or ‚ÄòJewish.‚Äô‚Äù Similarly, the Deaf community rejects people-first language in favor of identity-first language.  Aging  To a certain degree, physical impairments and changing mental states are almost ubiquitously experienced by people as they age. Aging populations are often stigmatized for having a high prevalence of disability. Kathleen Woodward, writing in Key Words for Disability Studies, explains the phenomenon as follows:  Employment  Studies have illustrated a correlation between disability and poverty. Notably, jobs offered to disabled people are scarce. In the developed world there are programs in place that aid intellectually disabled (ID) people to acquire skills they need in the workforce. Such programs include sheltered workshops and adult day care programs. Sheltered programs consist of daytime activities such as gardening, manufacturing, and assembling. These activities facilitate routine-oriented tasks that in turn allow intellectually disabled people to gain experience before entering the workforce. Similarly, adult day care programs also include day time activities. However, these activities are based in an educational environment where intellectually disabled are able to engage in educational, physical, and communication-based tasks. This educationally based environment helps facilitate communication, memory, and general living skills. In addition, adult day care programs arrange opportunities for their students to engage in community activities. Such opportunities are arranged by scheduling field trips to public places (e.g. Disneyland, Zoo, and Movie Theater). Despite, both programs providing essential skills for intellectually disabled prior to entering the workforce researchers have found that intellectually disabled people prefer to be involved with community-integrated employment. Community-integrated employment are job opportunities offered to intellectually disabled people at minimum wage or a higher rate depending on the position. Community-integrated employment comes in a variety of occupations ranging from customer service, clerical, janitorial, hospitality and manufacturing positions. Within their daily tasks, community-integrated employees work alongside employees who do not have disabilities, but who are able to assist them with training. All three options allow intellectually disabled people to develop and exercise social skills that are vital to everyday life. However, it is not guaranteed that community-integrated employees receive the same treatment as employees that do not have ID. According to Lindstrom, Hirano, McCarthy, and Alverson, community-integrated employees are less likely to receive raises. In addition, studies conducted in 2013 illustrated only 26% of employees with ID retained full-time status.L. Lindstrom, K.A. Hirano, C. McCarthy, C.Y. Alverson \\"Just having a job\\": Career advancement for low-wage workers with intellectual and developmental disabilities Career Development and Transition for Exceptional Individuals, 37 (1) (2014), pp. 1‚Äì10 Furthermore, many with disabilities, intellectual and (or) psychical, finding a stable workforce poses many challenges. According to a study conducted by JARID (Journal of Applied Research and Intellectual Disability, indicates that although finding a job may be difficult for an intellectually disabled individual, stabilizing a job is even harder. This is largely due to two main factors: production skills and effective social skills. This idea is supported by Chadsey-Rusch, who claims that securing employment for the intellectually disabled, requires adequate production skills and effective social skills. However, other underlying factors for job loss include, structural factors and the integration between worker and workplace. As stated by Kilsby, limited structural factors can affect a multitude of factors in a job. Factors such as a restricted number of hours an intellectually disabled person is allowed to work. This in return, according to Fabian, Wistow, and Schneider leads to a lack of opportunity to develop relationships with coworkers and a chance to better integrate within the workplace. Nevertheless, those who are unable to stabilize a job often are left discouraged. According to the same study conducted by JARED, many who had participated found that they had made smaller incomes when compared to their co-workers, had an excess of time throughout their days, because they did not have work. They also had feelings of hopelessness and failure. According to the NOD ( National Organization On Disability), not only do the (ID) face constant discouragement but many live below the poverty line, because they are unable to find or stabilize employment and (or) because of employee restricting factors placed on ID workers. This then causes the (ID) the incapacity to provide for themselves basic necessities one needs. Items such as food, medical care, transportation, and housing.  Poverty  The Cripples, Pieter Bruegel, 1568 There is a global correlation between disability and poverty, produced by a variety of factors. Disability and poverty may form a vicious circle, in which physical barriers and stigma of disability make it more difficult to get income, which in turn diminishes access to health care and other necessities for a healthy life. The World report on disability indicates that half of all disabled people cannot afford health care, compared to a third of abled people.World Health Organization, World report on disability, 2011. In countries without public services for adults with disabilities, their families may be impoverished.  Disasters  There is limited research knowledge, but many anecdotal reports, on what happens when disasters impact disabled people. Individuals with disabilities are greatly affected by disasters. Those with physical disabilities can be at risk when evacuating if assistance is not available. Individuals with cognitive impairments may struggle with understanding instructions that must be followed in the event a disaster occurs. All of these factors can increase the degree of variation of risk in disaster situations with disabled individuals. Research studies have consistently found discrimination against individuals with disabilities during all phases of a disaster cycle. The most common limitation is that people cannot physically access buildings or transportation, as well as access disaster-related services. The exclusion of these individuals is caused in part by the lack of disability-related training provided to emergency planners and disaster relief personnel.  Theory  The International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF), produced by the World Health Organization, distinguishes between body functions (physiological or psychological, such as vision) and body structures (anatomical parts, such as the eye and related structures). Impairment in bodily structure or function is defined as involving an anomaly, defect, loss or other significant deviation from certain generally accepted population standards, which may fluctuate over time. Activity is defined as the execution of a task or action. The ICF lists 9 broad domains of functioning which can be affected: * Learning and applying knowledge * General tasks and demands * Communication * Basic physical mobility, Domestic life, and Self-care (for example, activities of daily living) * Interpersonal interactions and relationships * Community, social and civic life, including employment * Other major life areas In concert with disability scholars, the introduction to the ICF states that a variety of conceptual models have been proposed to understand and explain disability and functioning, which it seeks to integrate. These models include the following:  Medical model  The medical model views disability as a problem of the person, directly caused by disease, trauma, or other health conditions which therefore requires sustained medical care in the form of individual treatment by professionals. In the medical model, management of the disability is aimed at a \\"cure\\", or the individual's adjustment and behavioral change that would lead to an \\"almost- cure\\" or effective cure. In the medical model, medical care is viewed as the main issue, and at the political level, the principal response is that of modifying or reforming healthcare policy.  Social model  The social model of disability sees \\"disability\\" as a socially created problem and a matter of the full integration of individuals into society. In this model, disability is not an attribute of an individual, but rather a complex collection of conditions, created by the social environment. The management of the problem requires social action and it is the collective responsibility of society to create a society in which limitations for disabled people are minimal. Disability is both cultural and ideological in creation. According to the social model, equal access for someone with an impairment/disability is a human rights concern. The social model of disability has come under criticism. While recognizing the importance played by the social model in stressing the responsibility of society, scholars, including Tom Shakespeare, point out the limits of the model and urge the need for a new model that will overcome the \\"medical vs. social\\" dichotomy. The limitations of this model mean that often the vital services and information persons with disabilities face are simply not available, often due to limited economic returns in supporting them. Some say medical humanities is a fruitful field where the gap between the medical and the social model of disability might be bridged. = Social construction = The social construction of disability is the idea that disability is constructed by social expectations and institutions rather than biological differences. Highlighting the ways society and institutions construct disability is one of the main focuses of this idea. In the same way that race and gender are not biologically fixed, neither is disability. Around the early 1970s, sociologists, notably Eliot Friedson, began to argue that labeling theory and social deviance could be applied to disability studies. This led to the creation of the social construction of disability theory. The social construction of disability is the idea that disability is constructed as the social response to a deviance from the norm. The medical industry is the creator of the ill and disabled social role. Medical professionals and institutions, who wield expertise over health, have the ability to define health and physical and mental norms. When an individual has a feature that creates an impairment, restriction, or limitation from reaching the social definition of health, the individual is labeled as disabled. Under this idea, disability is not defined by the physical features of the body but by a deviance from the social convention of health. The social construction of disability would argue that the medical model of disability's view that a disability is an impairment, restriction, or limitation is wrong. Instead what is seen as a disability is just a difference in the individual from what is considered \\"normal\\" in society.  Other models  * The spectrum model refers to the range of audibility, sensibility, and visibility under which people function. The model asserts that disability does not necessarily mean a reduced spectrum of operations. Rather, disability is often defined according to thresholds set on a continuum of disability. * The moral model refers to the attitude that people are morally responsible for their own disability. For example, disability may be seen as a result of bad actions of parents if congenital, or as a result of practicing witchcraft if not. Echoes of this can be seen in the doctrine of karma in Indian religions. It also includes notions that a disability gives a person \\"special abilities to perceive, reflect, transcend, be spiritual\\". * The expert/professional model has provided a traditional response to disability issues and can be seen as an offshoot of the medical model. Within its framework, professionals follow a process of identifying the impairment and its limitations (using the medical model), and taking the necessary action to improve the position of the disabled person. This has tended to produce a system in which an authoritarian, over-active service provider prescribes and acts for a passive client. * The tragedy/charity model depicts disabled people as victims of circumstance who are deserving of pity. This, along with the medical model, are the models most used by non-disabled people to define and explain disability. * The legitimacy model views disability as a value-based determination about which explanations for the atypical are legitimate for membership in the disability category. This viewpoint allows for multiple explanations and models to be considered as purposive and viable. * The social adapted model states although a person's disability poses some limitations in an able-bodied society, often the surrounding society and environment are more limiting than the disability itself. * The economic model defines disability in terms of reduced ability to work, the related loss of productivity and economic effects on the individual, employer and society in general. * The empowering model (also, customer model) allows for the person with a disability and his/her family to decide the course of his/her treatment. This turns the professional into a service provider whose role is to offer guidance and carry out the client's decisions. This model \\"empowers\\" the individual to pursue his/her own goals. * The market model of disability is minority rights and consumerist model of disability that recognizing disabled people and their stakeholders as representing a large group of consumers, employees, and voters. This model looks to personal identity to define disability and empowers people to chart their own destiny in everyday life, with a particular focus on economic empowerment. By this model, based on US Census data, there are 1.2 billion people in the world who consider themselves to have a disability. \\"This model states that due to the size of the demographic, companies and governments will serve the desires, pushed by demand as the message becomes prevalent in the cultural mainstream.\\" * The consumer model of disability is based upon the ‚Äúrights-based\\" model and claims that disabled people should have equal rights and access to products, goods, and services offered by businesses. The consumer model extends the rights-based model by proposing that businesses, not only accommodate customers with disabilities under the requirements of legislation but that businesses actively seek, market to, welcome and fully engage disabled people in all aspects of business service activities. The model suggests that all business operations, for example, websites, policies, and procedures, mission statements, emergency plans, programs, and services, should integrate access and inclusion practices. Furthermore, these access and inclusion practices should be based on established customer service access and inclusion standards that embrace and support the active engagement of people of all abilities in business offerings.Smith, T.B. (2012). A New and Emerging Model of Disability: The Consumer Model. White Paper. The Pennsylvania State University In this regard, specialized products and specialized services become important, such as auxiliary means, prostheses, special foods, domestic help, and assisted living. * Different theories revolve around prejudice, stereotyping, discrimination, and stigma related to disability. One of the more popular ones, as put by Weiner, Perry, and Magnusson 's (1988) work with attribution theory, physical stigmas are perceived as to be uncontrollable and elicit pity and desire to help, whereas, mental-behavioral stigmas are considered to be controllable and therefore elicit anger and desire to neglect the individuals with disabilities. * The ‚Äòjust world hypothesis‚Äô talks about how a person is viewed as deserving the disability. And because it is the fault of that person, an observer does not feel obligated to feel bad for him or to help him.  Identity  In contexts where their differences are visible, persons with disabilities often face stigma. People frequently react to disabled presence with fear, pity, patronization, intrusive gazes, revulsion, or disregard. These reactions can, and often do, exclude persons with disabilities from accessing social spaces along with the benefits and resources these spaces provide. Disabled writer/researcher Jenny Morris describes how stigma functions to marginalize persons with disabilities: Additionally, facing stigma can cause harm to the psycho-emotional well-being of the person being stigmatized. One of the ways in which the psycho-emotional health of persons with disabilities is adversely affected is through the internalization of the oppression they experience, which can lead to feeling that they are weak, crazy, worthless or any number of other negative attributes that may be associated with their conditions. Internalization of oppression damages the self-esteem of the person affected and shapes their behaviors in ways that are compliant with nondisabled dominance. Ableist ideas are frequently internalized when disabled people are pressured by the people and institutions around them to hide and downplay their disabled difference, or, \\"pass\\". According to writer Simi Linton, the act of passing takes a deep emotional toll by causing disabled individuals to experience loss of community, anxiety and self-doubt. The media play a significant role in creating and reinforcing stigma associated with disability. Media portrayals of disability usually cast disabled presence as necessarily marginal within society at large. These portrayals simultaneously reflect and influence the popular perception of disabled difference.  Tropes  There are distinct tactics that the media frequently employ in representing disabled presence. These common ways of framing disability are heavily criticized for being dehumanizing and failing to place importance on the perspectives of persons with disabilities. = Inspiration porn = Inspiration porn refers to portrayals of persons with disabilities in which they are presented as being inspiring simply because the person has a disability. These portrayals are criticized because they are created with the intent of making non-disabled viewers feel better about themselves in comparison to the individual portrayed. Rather than recognizing the humanity of persons with disabilities, inspiration porn turns them into objects of inspiration for a non-disabled audience. = Supercrip = The supercrip trope refers to instances when media reports on or portray a disabled person who has made a noteworthy achievement; but center on their disability rather than what they actually did. They are portrayed as awe-inspiring for being exceptional compared to others with the same or similar conditions. This trope is widely used in reporting on disabled athletes as well as in portrayals of autistic savants. Many disabled people denounce these representations as reducing people to their condition rather than viewing them as full people. Furthermore, supercrip portrayals are criticized for creating the unrealistic expectation that disability should be accompanied by some type of special talent, genius, or insight. = Disabled villain = Characters in fiction that bear physical or mental markers of difference from perceived societal norms are frequently positioned as villains within a text. Lindsey Row-Heyveld notes, for instance, ‚Äúthat villainous pirates are scraggly, wizened, and inevitably kitted out with a peg leg, eye patch, or hook hand whereas heroic pirates look like Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow.‚Äù Disabled people's visible differences from the abled majority are meant to evoke fear in audiences that can perpetuate the mindset of disabled people being a threat to individual or public interests and well-being.  Self advocacy  Some disabled people have attempted to resist marginalization through the use of the social model in opposition to the medical model; with the aim of shifting criticism away from their bodies and impairments and towards the social institutions that oppress them relative to their abled peers. Disability activism that demands many grievances be addressed, such as lack of accessibility, poor representation in media, general disrespect, and lack of recognition, originates from a social model framework. Embracing disability as a positive identity by becoming involved in disabled communities and participating in disabled culture can be an effective way to combat internalised prejudice; and can challenge dominant narratives about disability.  Intersections  The experiences that disabled people have to navigate social institutions vary greatly as a function of what other social categories they may belong to. The categories that intersect with a disability to create unique experiences of ableism include, but are not limited to, race and gender. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities differentiates two kinds of disability intersection, race disability intersection and gender disability intersection. = Race = Disabled people who are also racial minorities generally have less access to support and are more vulnerable to violent discrimination. For example, in the United States people of color who are mentally ill are more frequently victims of police brutality than their white counterparts. Camille A. Nelson, writing for the Berkeley Journal of Criminal Law, notes that for ‚Äúpeople who are negatively racialized, that is people who are perceived as being non-white, and for whom mental illness is either known or assumed, interaction with police is precarious and potentially dangerous.‚Äù = Gender = The marginalization of disabled people can leave persons with disabilities unable to actualize what society expects of gendered existence. This lack of recognition for their gender identity can leave persons with disabilities with feelings of inadequacy. Thomas J. Gerschick of Illinois State University describes why this denial of gendered identity occurs: To the extent that women and men with disabilities are gendered, the interactions of these two identities lead to different experiences. Disabled women face a sort of ‚Äúdouble stigmatization‚Äù in which their membership to both of these marginalized categories simultaneously exacerbates the negative stereotypes associated with each as they are ascribed to them. According to The UN Woman Watch, \\"Persistence of certain cultural, legal and institutional barriers makes women and girls with disabilities the victims of two-fold discrimination: as women and as persons with disabilities.\\" As Rosemarie Garland-Thomson puts it, ‚ÄúWomen with disabilities, even more intensely than women in general, have been cast in the collective cultural imagination as inferior, lacking, excessive, incapable, unfit, and useless.‚Äù Assistive technology Assistive Technology is a generic term for devices and modifications (for a person or within a society) that help overcome or remove a disability. The first recorded example of the use of a prosthesis dates to at least 1800 BC. The wheelchair dates from the 17th century. The curb cut is a related structural innovation. Other examples are standing frames, text telephones, accessible keyboards, large print, Braille, & speech recognition software. Disabled people often develop personal or community adaptations, such as strategies to suppress tics in public (for example in Tourette's syndrome), or sign language in deaf communities. As the personal computer has become more ubiquitous, various organizations have formed to develop software and hardware to make computers more accessible for disabled people. Some software and hardware, such as Voice Finger, Freedom Scientific's JAWS, the Free and Open Source alternative Orca etc. have been specifically designed for disabled people while other software and hardware, such as Nuance's Dragon NaturallySpeaking, were not developed specifically for disabled people, but can be used to increase accessibility.Dragon Naturally Speaking The LOMAK keyboard was designed in New Zealand specifically for persons with disabilities. The World Wide Web consortium recognized a need for International Standards for Web Accessibility for persons with disabilities and created the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). As at Dec 2012 the standard is WCAG 2.0 (WCAG = Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). Adapted sports Wheelchair basketball match between South Africa and Iran at the 2008 Summer Paralympics The Paralympic Games (meaning \\"alongside the Olympics\\") are held after the (Summer and Winter) Olympics. The Paralympic Games include athletes with a wide range of physical disabilities. In member countries, organizations exist to organize competition in the Paralympic sports on levels ranging from recreational to elite (for example, Disabled Sports USA and BlazeSports America in the United States). The Paralympics developed from a rehabilitation program for British war veterans with spinal injuries. In 1948, Sir Ludwig Guttman, a neurologist working with World War II veterans with spinal injuries at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury in the UK, began using sport as part of the rehabilitation programs of his patients. In 2006, the Extremity Games were formed for physically disabled people, specifically limb loss or limb difference, to be able to compete in extreme sports. Rights and government policies Rights movement The disability rights movement aims to secure equal opportunities and equal rights for disabled people. The specific goals and demands of the movement are accessibility and safety in transportation, architecture, and the physical environment; equal opportunities in independent living, employment, education, and housing; and freedom from abuse, neglect, and violations of patients' rights. Effective civil rights legislation is sought to secure these opportunities and rights. The early disability rights movement was dominated by the medical model of disability, where emphasis was placed on curing or treating disabled people so that they would adhere to the social norm, but starting in the 1960s, rights groups began shifting to the social model of disability, where disability is interpreted as an issue of discrimination, thereby paving the way for rights groups to achieve equality through legal means. Policies and actions =Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities= On December 13, 2006, the United Nations formally agreed on the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the first human rights treaty of the 21st century, to protect and enhance the rights and opportunities of the world's estimated 650 million disabled people. , 99 of the 147 signatories had ratified the Convention. Countries that sign the convention are required to adopt national laws, and remove old ones, so that persons with disabilities will, for example, have equal rights to education, employment, and cultural life; to the right to own and inherit property; to not be discriminated against in marriage, etc.; and to not be unwilling subjects in medical experiments. UN officials, including the High Commissioner for Human Rights, have characterized the bill as representing a paradigm shift in attitudes toward a more rights-based view of disability in line with the social model. =International Year of Disabled Persons= In 1976, the United Nations began planning for its International Year of Disabled Persons (1981), later renamed the International Year of Disabled Persons. The UN Decade of Disabled Persons (1983‚Äì1993) featured a World Programme of Action Concerning Disabled Persons. In 1979, Frank Bowe was the only person with a disability representing any country in the planning of IYDP-1981. Today, many countries have named representatives who are themselves individuals with disabilities. The decade was closed in an address before the General Assembly by Robert Davila. Both Bowe and Davila are deaf. In 1984, UNESCO accepted sign language for use in the education of deaf children and youth. =Policies in the United States= In the United States, the Department of Labor's 2014 rules for federal contractors, defined as companies that make more than $50,000/year from the federal government, required them to have as a goal that 7% of their workforce must be disabled people. In schools, the ADA says that all classrooms must be wheelchair accessible. The U.S. Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, commonly known as the Access Board, created the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to help offer guidelines for transportation and accessibility for the physically disabled. About 12.6% of the U.S. population are individuals who have a mental or physical disability. Many are unemployed because of prejudiced assumptions that a person with disabilities is unable to complete tasks that are commonly required in the workforce. This became a major Human rights issue because of the discrimination that this group faced when trying to apply for jobs in the U.S. Many advocacy groups protested against such discrimination, asking the federal government to implement laws and policies that would help individuals with disabilities. Rehabilitation Act of 1973 The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 was enacted with the purpose of protecting individuals with disabilities from prejudicial treatment by government-funded programs, employers, and agencies. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 has not only helped protect U.S. citizens from being discriminated against but it has also created confidence amongst individuals to feel more comfortable with their disability. There are many sections within The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, that contains detailed information about what is covered in this policy. ; Section 501 : An employer must hire an individual who meets the qualifications of a job description despite any preexisting disabilities. ; Section 503 : Requires contractors or subcontractors, who receive more than $10,000 from the government to hire people with disabilities and to accommodate them with the needs that they need to achieve in the workforce. ; Section 504 : States that receive federal money may not discriminate against any person with disabilities who qualifies for a program or job. On June 22, 1999, the United States Supreme Court issued a ruling in Olmstead vs. L. C. that said unjustified segregation of persons with disabilities constitutes discrimination in violation of title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. This has been interpreted as meaning people with disabilities must be given all opportunities by the government to stay in their own homes as opposed to assisted living, nursing homes or worse, institutions for the disabled. It has been interpreted as meaning the government must make all reasonable efforts to allow people with disabilities to be included in their respective communities and enjoy family and friends, work if possible, get married, own homes and interact with nondisabled people. This is why the United States has so many community-based services today for the disabled including but not limited to home health aides, personal care attendants and other programs to keep people with disabilities in their own homes and communities. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 The federal government enacted The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which was created to allow equal opportunity for jobs, access to private and government-funded facilities, and transportation for disabled people. This act was created with the purpose to ensure that employers would not discriminate against any individual despite their disability. In 1990, data was gathered to show the percentage of disabled people who worked in the U.S. Out of the 13% who filled out the survey, only 53% percent of individuals with disabilities worked while 90% of this group population did not, the government wanted to change this, they wanted Americans with disabilities to have the same opportunities as those who did not have a disability. The ADA required corporations to not only hire qualified disabled people but also accommodate them and their needs. ; Title I: Employment : An employer must give a qualified individual with disabilities the same opportunities as any other employee despite their disability. The employer must offer equal work privileges to someone who has a disability including but not limited to pay, work hours, training, etc. The employer must also create accommodations suitable for the person and their physical or mental disabilities. ; Title II: State and Local Government Activities : Requires that the government give disabled people the same opportunities involving work, programs, building access, and services. Title II also requires that buildings create easy access for disabled people and provide communicators who will be able to help those with hearing or speaking impairments. Public spaces are however not required to create accommodations that would, in turn, alter their services as long as the services proved that they did all they could to prevent discrimination against disabled people. ; Title II: Transportation : Public transportation should be customized so that disabled people may have easy access to public transit. Paratransit is a service that provides transportation to people who are unable to get from one destination to another due to their mental or physical disability. ; Title II: Public Accommodations : Public accommodations require that private businesses create accommodations that will allow disabled people easy access to buildings. Private businesses may not discriminate against disabled people and must provide accommodations that are reasonable, alterations may be made so that a person with disabilities can have equal access to facilities that are provided, communicators for the hearing impaired, devices for the visually impaired, and wheelchair access. Facilities must regulate with the ADA, when regulating the building's infrastructure so it meets the ADA regulations. ; Title IV: Telecommunication Relay Services : Requires telephone companies to have TRS seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day. It requires telephone companies to create accommodations for deaf/hard of hearing people by providing a third party that will be able to assistant both parties in communicating with one another. =Policies in the United Kingdom= In the UK, the Department for Work and Pension is a government department responsible for promoting disability awareness and among its aims is to increase the understanding of disability and removal of barriers for disabled people in the workplace. According to a news report, a people survey conducted in the UK shows a 23% increase in reported discrimination and harassment in the workplace at The Department for Work and Pension. The survey shows the number of reports for discrimination due to disability was in the majority compared to discrimination due to gender, ethnicity or age. DWP received criticism for the survey results. As a department responsible for tackling discrimination at work, the DWP results may indicate room for improvement from within. A DWP spokesperson said the survey results do not necessarily indicate an increase in the number of reports, but rather reflecting the outcomes of efforts to encourage people to come forward. =Policies in Sweden= Political issues A 28-year-old Iraqi woman who lost both of her legs during the Iraq War in 2005 Political rights, social inclusion and citizenship have come to the fore in developed and some developing countries. The debate has moved beyond a concern about the perceived cost of maintaining dependent disabled people to finding effective ways to ensure that disabled people can participate in and contribute to society in all spheres of life. In developing nations, where the vast bulk of the estimated 650 million disabled people reside, a great deal of work is needed to address concerns ranging from accessibility and education to self- empowerment, self-supporting employment, and beyond. In the past few years, disability rights activists have focused on obtaining full citizenship for the disabled. There are obstacles in some countries in getting full employment; public perception of disabled people may vary. =Abuse= Disability abuse happens when a person is abused physically, financially, verbally or mentally due to the person having a disability. As many disabilities are not visible (for example, asthma, learning disabilities) some abusers cannot rationalize the non-physical disability with a need for understanding, support, and so on. As the prevalence of disability and the cost of supporting disability increases with medical advancement and longevity in general, this aspect of society becomes of greater political importance. How political parties treat their disabled constituents may become a measure of a political party's understanding of disability, particularly in the social model of disability. =Insurance= Disability benefit, or disability pension, is a major kind of disability insurance that is provided by government agencies to people who are temporarily or permanently unable to work due to a disability. In the U.S., the disability benefit is provided in the category of Supplemental Security Income. In Canada, it is within the Canada Pension Plan. In other countries, disability benefits may be provided under social security systems. Costs of disability pensions are steadily growing in Western countries, mainly in Europe and the United States. It was reported that, in the UK, expenditure on disability pensions accounted for 0.9% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1980; two decades later it had reached 2.6% of GDP.OECD. Transforming disability into ability: Policies to promote work and income security for disabled people. Paris: OECD Publication Offices. 2003 Several studies have reported a link between increased absence from work due to sickness and elevated risk of future disability pension. A study by researchers in Denmark suggests that information on self-reported days of absence due to sickness can be used to effectively identify future potential groups for disability pension. These studies may provide useful information for policymakers, case managing authorities, employers, and physicians. In Switzerland, social policies in the field of disability have been significantly reshaped over the last two decades by reducing the number of allowances awarded and by increasing the recourse to vocational rehabilitation measures. Drawing on interviews conducted with individuals who have been involved in programmes set up by Swiss disability insurance, a study highlights their uncertainties and concerns relating to their place in society, as well as their reactions to disability insurance's interventions. 50x50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. Private, for-profit disability insurance plays a role in providing incomes to disabled people, but the nationalized programs are the safety net that catch most claimants. Demographics Estimates of worldwide and country-wide numbers of individuals with disabilities are problematic. The varying approaches taken to defining disability notwithstanding, demographers agree that the world population of individuals with disabilities is very large. For example, in 2012, the World Health Organization estimated a world population of 6.5 billion people. Of those, nearly 650 million people, or 10%, were estimated to be moderately or severely disabled. In 2018 the International Labour Organization estimated that about a billion people, one- seventh of the world population, had disabilities, 80% of them in developing countries, and 80% of working age. Excluding disabled people from the workforce was reckoned to cost up to 7% of gross domestic product. Developing nations Disability is more common in developing than in developed nations. The connection between disability and poverty is thought to be part of a \\"vicious cycle\\" in which these constructs are mutually reinforcing.

Wilson first designed a microcomputer during a break from studies at Selwyn College, Cambridge. She subsequently joined Acorn Computers and was instrumental in designing the BBC Micro, including the BBC BASIC programming language whose development she led for the next 15 years. She first began designing the ARM reduced instruction set computer (RISC) in 1983, which entered production two years later. It became popular in embedded systems and is now the most widely used processor architecture in smartphones. Wilson is currently a director at the technology conglomerate Broadcom Inc. In 2011, she was listed in Maximum PC as number 8 in an article titled \\"The 15 Most Important Women in Tech History\\". She was made a Commander of the British Empire in 2019. Early life and education Born Roger Wilson, she was raised in Leeds, Yorkshire, by parents who were both teachers, her father specialising in English and her mother in physics. From 1975, she studied computer science and the Mathematical Tripos at Selwyn College, University of Cambridge. In an Easter break from university, Wilson designed a microcomputer with a MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor inspired by the earlier MK14, which was used to electronically control feed for cows. Career In 1978, she joined Acorn Computers Ltd, after designing a device to prevent cigarette lighter sparks triggering payouts on fruit machines. Her computer design was used by Chris Curry and Hermann Hauser to build the Acorn Micro-Computer, the first of a long line of computers sold by the company. In July 1981, Wilson extended the Acorn Atom's BASIC programming language dialect into an improved version for the Acorn Proton, a microcomputer that enabled Acorn to win the contract with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) for their ambitious computer education project. Hauser employed a deception, telling both Wilson and colleague Steve Furber that the other had agreed a prototype could be built within a week. Taking up the challenge, she designed the system including the circuit board and components from Monday to Wednesday, which required fast new DRAM integrated circuits to be sourced directly from Hitachi. By Thursday evening, a prototype had been built, but the software had bugs, requiring her to stay up all night and into Friday debugging. Wilson recalled watching the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer on a small portable television while attempting to debug and re- solder the prototype. It was a success with the BBC, who awarded Acorn the contract. Along with Furber, Wilson was present backstage at the machine's first airing on television, in case any software fixes were required. She later described the event as \\"a unique moment in time when the public wanted to know how this stuff works and could be shown and taught how to program.\\" The Proton became the BBC Micro and its BASIC evolved into BBC BASIC, whose development was led by Wilson for the next 15 years. As well as programming, she wrote the manuals and technical specifications, realising communication was an important part of being successful. In October 1983, Wilson began designing the instruction set for one of the first reduced instruction set computer (RISC) processors, the Acorn RISC Machine (ARM), The ARM1 was delivered on 26 April 1985 and worked first time. This processor type was later to become one of the most successful IP cores ‚Äì a licensed CPU core ‚Äì and by 2012 was being used in 95% of smartphones. Wilson designed Acorn Replay, the video architecture for Acorn machines. This included operating system extensions for video access, as well as the codecs, optimized to run high frame rate video on ARM CPUs from the ARM 2 onwards. She was a member of the board of the technology and games company Eidos Interactive, which bought and created Eidos Interactive, for the years following its flotation in 1990. She was a consultant to ARM Ltd when it was split off from Acorn in 1990. ARM development in 2009 Since the demise of Acorn Computers, Wilson has made a small number of public appearances to talk about work done there. She is now the Director of IC Design in Broadcom's Cambridge, UK office. She was the Chief Architect of Broadcom's Firepath processor. Firepath has its history in Acorn Computers, which, after being renamed to Element 14, was bought by Broadcom in 2000. Wilson was listed in 2011 in Maximum PC as number 8 in an article titled \\"The 15 Most Important Women in Tech History\\".  Honours and awards  She was awarded the Fellow Award by the Computer History Museum in California in 2012 \\"for her work, with Steve Furber, on the BBC Micro computer and the ARM processor architecture.\\" In 2013 Wilson was elected as a Fellow of the prestigious Royal Society. She received the 2014 Lovie Lifetime Achievement Award in acknowledgement for her invention of the ARM processor. In 2016 she became an honorary fellow of her alma mater, Selwyn College, Cambridge. Wilson was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2019 Birthday Honours for services to computing. Personal life Wilson underwent gender reassignment from male to female in 1994. She enjoys photography and is involved in a local theatre group, where she is in charge of costumes and set pieces and has acted in a number of productions. She has also played a cameo role as a pub landlady in the BBC television drama Micro Men, in which a younger Wilson is played by Stefan Butler.

Biography Born in Aberdyfi, Christopher Evans spent his childhood in Wales and was educated at Christ College, Brecon (1941‚Äì49). He spent two years in the RAF (1950‚Äì52), and worked as a science journalist and writer until 1957, when he began a B.A. course in Psychology at University College, London, graduating with honours in 1960. After a summer fellowship at Duke University in the United States, where he first met his American wife, Nancy Fullmer, he took up a Research Assistant post in the Physics Laboratory, University of Reading, working on eye movements under Professor R. W. Ditchburn. Upon receiving his PhD (the title of his thesis was ‚ÄúPattern Perception and the Stabilised Retinal Image‚Äù), he went to the Division of Computer Science, National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, in 1964, where he remained until his death from cancer in 1979. He had two children, Christopher Samuel Evans and Victoria Evans-Theiler. Works In 1979, Christopher Evans wrote a book about the oncoming microcomputer revolution, The Mighty Micro: The Impact of the Computer Revolution, which included predictions for the future up to the year 2000.Mars Hill Review. This book was also printed in the USA as The Micro Millennium (New York: The Viking Press, ). He subsequently scripted and presented for ATV a six-part television series based on this book and broadcast posthumously by ITV between October and December 1979.IEEE Book Review. His other books include Cults of Unreason, a study of Scientology and other pseudoscience, and Landscapes of the Night: How and Why We Dream. In the 1970s, Evans undertook a set of interviews with computer pioneers such as Konrad Zuse and Grace Hopper. These were released through the Science Museum, London, as Pioneers of Computing, a set of cassette tapes. Christopher Evans also edited two anthologies of psychological science fiction/horror stories, Mind at Bay and Mind in Chains, a collection of science writings, Cybernetics: Key Papers, a reference book Psychology: A Dictionary of Mind, Brain and Behaviour, and was a contributing editor to the science magazine Omni. A keen pilot, he also edited a yearly pilot's diary of rural airfields in Great Britain. Evans had a significant friendship and collaboration with the writer J. G. Ballard. Together around 1968 they developed ideas for a play about a car crash, offered to the Institute of Contemporary Arts but not produced. Later came an exhibition of crashed cars at The New Arts Lab in London in 1970, and ultimately Ballard's novel Crash, published in 1973. Evans' charismatic appearance as a \\"hoodlum scientist\\" (in Ballard's description ) was an inspiration for the character of Dr. Robert Vaughan in Crash. Evans also appears in Ballard's fictionalised life story The Kindness of Women as the psychologist Dr. Richard Sutherland. (Ballard recounts his friendship with Evans in his autobiography Miracles of Life.) During the 1970s, Evans was the scientific advisor to the ITV TV series, The Tomorrow People.Screen Online Christopher Evans died of cancer in 1979, at the age of 48, shortly after The Mighty Micro had been published in hardcoverEvans 1980, foreword by Robin Webster and before the broadcast of the TV programmes.Programme director's postscript to the first episode of _The Mighty Micro_ , October 1979.

After spending several years as assistant editor of Instrument Practice, Sinclair founded Sinclair Radionics in 1961, where he produced the first slim-line electronic pocket calculator in 1972 (the Sinclair Executive). Sinclair later moved into the production of home computers and produced the Sinclair ZX80, the UK's first mass-market home computer for less than ¬£100, and later, with Sinclair Research, the ZX81 and ZX Spectrum; the latter is widely recognised by consumers and programmers for its importance in the early days of the British home computer industry. Sinclair Research also produced the TV80, a flatscreen portable mini television utilising a cathode ray tube, however, LCD television technology was in advanced development and the Sinclair FTV1 (TV80) was a commercial flop, only 15,000 units being produced. Knighted in 1983, Sinclair formed Sinclair Vehicles and released the Sinclair C5, a battery electric vehicle that was also a commercial failure. Since then Sinclair has concentrated on personal transport, including the A-bike, a folding bicycle for commuters that weighs and folds down small enough to be carried on public transport. Early life, family and education Sinclair's father and grandfather were engineers; both had been apprentices at Vickers the shipbuilders. His grandfather George Sinclair was an innovative naval architect who got the paravane, a mine sweeping device, to work. George Sinclair's son, George William \\"Bill\\" Sinclair, wanted to take religious orders or become a journalist. His father suggested he train as an engineer first; Bill became a mechanical engineer and remained in the field. At the outbreak of World War II in 1939 he was running his own machine tools business in London, and later worked for the Ministry of Supply.Dale 1985, pg.1 Clive Sinclair was born to George Sinclair and Thora Edith Ella Marles in 1940 near Richmond, then in Surrey. He and his mother left London for safety to stay with an aunt in Devon, where they eventually travelled to Teignmouth. A telegram arrived shortly afterwards, bringing the news that their home in Richmond had been bombed. Sinclair's father found a house in Bracknell in Berkshire. His brother Iain was born in 1943 and his sister Fiona in 1947. At the age of 14, Sinclair designed a submarine. During holidays he could pursue his ideas and teach himself what he wanted to know. Sinclair had little interest in sports and found himself out of place at school. He preferred the company of adults, which he got only from his family.Dale 1985, pg.2 Sinclair attended Boxgrove Preparatory School, excelling in mathematics. By the time he was ten, his father had financial problems. He had branched out from machine tools and planned to import miniature tractors from the U.S.; he had to give up the business. Because of his father's problems, Sinclair had to move school several times. After a time at Reading School, Sinclair took his O-levels at Highgate School in London in 1955 and A-levels in physics, pure maths, and applied maths at St. George's College, Weybridge.Dale 1985, pg.3 During his early years, Sinclair earned money mowing lawns and washing up, and earned 6d (old pence) more than permanent staff in a caf√©. Later he went for holiday jobs at electronic companies. At Solatron he inquired about the possibility of electrically propelled personal vehicles. Sinclair applied for a holiday job at Mullard and took one of his circuit designs; he was rejected for precociousness. While still at school he wrote his first article for Practical Wireless. Sinclair did not want to go to university when he left school at the age of 18 and instead he sold miniature electronic kits by mail order to the hobby market.Dale 1985, pg.4 Career Sinclair Radionics Sinclair's Micro Kit was formalised in an exercise book dated 19 June 1958 three weeks before his A-levels. Sinclair drew a radio circuit, Model Mark I, with a components list: cost per set 9/11 (49¬Ωp), plus coloured wire and solder, nuts and bolts, plus celluloid chassis (drilled) for nine shillings (45p). Also in the book are advertisement rates for Radio Constructor (9d (3¬æp)/word, minimum 6/- (30p)) and Practical Wireless (5/6 (27¬Ωp) per line or part line).Dale 1985, pg.6, 7 Sinclair estimated producing 1,000 a month, placing orders with suppliers for 10,000 of each component to be delivered. Sinclair wrote a book for Bernard's Publishing, Practical transistor receivers Book 1, which appeared in January 1959. It was re-printed late that year and nine times subsequently. His practical stereo handbook was published in June 1959 and reprinted seven times over 14 years. The last book Sinclair wrote as an employee of Bernard's was Modern Transistor Circuits for Beginners, published in May 1962.Dale 1985, pg.11 At Bernard Babani he produced 13 constructors' books. In 1961 Sinclair registered Sinclair Radionics Ltd. His original choice, Sinclair Electronics, was taken; Sinclair Radio was available but did not sound right. Sinclair Radionics was formed on 25 July 1961. Sinclair made two attempts to raise startup capital to advertise his inventions and buy components. He designed PCB kits and licensed some technology. Then he took his design for a miniature transistor pocket radio and sought a backer for its production in kit form. Eventually he found someone who agreed to buy 55% of his company for ¬£3,000 but the deal did not go through. Sinclair, unable to find capital, joined United Trade Press (UTP) as technical editor of Instrument Practice. Sinclair appeared in the publication as an assistant editor in March 1962. Sinclair described making silicon planar transistors, their properties and applications and hoped they might be available by the end of 1962. Sinclair's obsession with miniaturisation became more obvious as his career progressed. Sinclair undertook a survey for Instrument Practice of semiconductor devices, which appeared in four sections between September 1962 and January 1963.Dale 1985, pg.12 His last appearance as assistant editor was in April 1969. Through UTP, Sinclair had access to thousands of devices from 36 manufacturers. He contacted Semiconductors Ltd (who at that time sold semiconductors made by Plessey) and ordered rejects to repair. He produced a design for a miniature radio powered by a couple of hearing aid cells and made a deal with Semiconductors to buy its micro-alloy transistors at 6d (2¬Ωp) each in boxes of 10,000. He then carried out his own quality control tests, and marketed his renamed MAT 100 and 120 at 7s 9d (38¬æp) and 101 and 121 at 8s 6d (42¬Ωp).Dale 1985, pg.13 Science of Cambridge Sinclair formed another company, initially called Ablesdeal Ltd, in 1973. This changed name several times, eventually becoming Science of Cambridge Ltd in July 1977. In June 1978 Science of Cambridge launched a microcomputer kit, the MK14, based on the National SC/MP chip. By July 1978, a personal computer project was under way. When Sinclair learned the NewBrain could not be sold at below ¬£100 as he envisaged, he turned to a simpler computer. In May 1979 Jim Westwood started the ZX80 project at Science of Cambridge; it was launched in February 1980 at ¬£79.95 in kit form and ¬£99.95 ready-built. In November, Science of Cambridge was renamed Sinclair Computers Ltd. Sinclair Research ZX Spectrum (1982) In March 1981, Sinclair Computers was renamed again as Sinclair Research Ltd and the Sinclair ZX81 was launched at ¬£49.95 in kit form and ¬£69.95 ready- built, by mail order. In February 1982 Timex obtained a licence to manufacture and market Sinclair's computers in the United States under the name Timex Sinclair. In April the ZX Spectrum was launched at ¬£125 for the 16 kB RAM version and ¬£175 for the 48 kB version. In March 1982 the company made an ¬£8.55 million profit on turnover of ¬£27.17 million, including ¬£383,000 government grants for the TV80 flat-screen portable television. In 1982 Sinclair converted the Barker & Wadsworth mineral water bottling factory into the company's headquarters. (This was sold to Cambridgeshire County Council in December 1985 owing to Sinclair's financial troubles.) The following year, he received a knighthood and formed Sinclair Vehicles Ltd. to develop electric vehicles, which resulted in the unsuccessful Sinclair C5 in 1985. In 1984, Sinclair launched the Sinclair QL computer, intended for professional users. Development of the ZX Spectrum continued with the enhanced ZX Spectrum 128 in 1985. In April 1986, Sinclair Research sold the Sinclair trademark and computer business to Amstrad for ¬£5 million. Sinclair Research Ltd. was reduced to an R&D; business and holding company, with shareholdings in several spin-off companies, formed to exploit technologies developed by the company. These included Anamartic Ltd. (wafer-scale integration) (CT2 mobile telephony) and Cambridge Computer Ltd. (Z88 portable computer and satellite television receivers). By 1990, Sinclair Research consisted of Sinclair and two other employees, and its activities have since concentrated on personal transport, the Zike electric bicycle, Zeta bicycle motor and the A-bike folding bicycle. By 1997, Sinclair Research consisted of Sinclair himself. By 2003, Sinclair Research was collaborating with Hong Kong-based firm Daka. A laboratory was set up for Daka near Croydon to develop products on a royalty basis. The two firms collaborated on a Sea Scooter and a wheelchair drive. Sinclair received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1983. Personal life Sinclair is a poker player and appeared in the first three series of the Late Night Poker on Channel 4. He won the first series final of the Celebrity Poker Club spin-off. On his religious views, Sinclair calls himself an atheist.\\"Oh God no\\", says Sir Clive Sinclair, \\"I was once asked [to be a godparent] and I said I can't, I'm an atheist. Actually I think I did have a couple, once, but I can't say I looked after them. Sort of lost them, or forgot about them.\\" Rosie Millard, 'Godparenthood that rests on fame, not faith', The Independent (London), 28 February 1998, Page 15. He is a member of British Mensa and was chairman for 17 years from 1980 to 1997. Sinclair was awarded the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Science by the University of Bath in 1983.bath.ac.uk He was knighted in the Queen's 1983 Birthday Honours List. Despite his involvement in computing, Sinclair does not use the Internet, stating that he does not like to have \\"technical or mechanical things around me\\" as it distracts from the process of invention. In 2010 he stated that he does not use computers himself, and prefers using the telephone rather than email. Views Sinclair has stated that it is unavoidable that artificial general intelligence will someday lead to human extinction: \\"Once you start to make machines that are rivalling and surpassing humans with intelligence, it's going to be very difficult for us to survive. It's just an inevitability.\\" See also *Micro Men, a one-off TV drama about Sinclair and Chris Curry. Notes References *Adamson, Ian; Kennedy, Richard (1986).

It is depicted as a world of murky swamps, steaming bayous, and jungles, resembling Earth during the Carboniferous period. Dagobah is 14,410 kilometers in diameter with an orbital period of 341 days. Dagobah's climate and atmosphere consists of two seasons; a dry season, where the uplands become too hot for most life forms to survive; and a wet season, consisting of violent lightning storms, dense fog, and long periods of torrential rainfall. Tash were a sentient species native to Dagobah. The Dagobah System lies within the Dagobah Subsector of the Sluis Sector, located in the Outer Rim Territories galactic quadrant region; 50,250 light-years from Coruscant. The sun was called Dagobah Prime. It is noted as being a former \\"Sith nexus\\" that's very strong with the Force, particularly \\"the Dark Side\\", and being chosen by Jedi Yoda as the planet to go into exile on to mask his presence and avoid discovery by the Galactic Empire. Depiction Film Dagobah was originally featured in the 1980 film The Empire Strikes Back. In its first appearance, the main protagonist of the film, Luke Skywalker, is attempting to land his X-wing starfighter on the planet and is met with a dense fog causing him to crash land in a small bayou. Shortly after his landing, the Jedi Master Yoda is introduced during his time in exile. Yoda reluctantly agrees to train Skywalker and during his training many aspects of the planet's environment are utilized. Moss-covered rocks are used for training in telekinesis, the undergrowth makes treks through the jungles more challenging, and vines hanging from tall trees are used as means to get across small bodies of water and other obstacles. Skywalker is shown to sense the strength of the Force in a particular cave on the planet which Yoda tells him to go into. Inside the cave, Skywalker is met with a mental challenge the dark side of the Force developed for him. The planet is also seen briefly in Return of the Jedi to depict Yoda's death and is featured in a deleted scene from Revenge of the Sith showing Yoda's arrival on the planet. George Lucas reportedly said it was removed so the film would not have \\"too many endings.\\" The scene was released under the title \\"Exile to Dagobah\\" on the film's DVD. Other media The Clone Wars featured Dagobah in a sixth- season episode, in which Yoda traveled to the planet as part of his own training to gain immortality through the Force. In the Star Wars expanded universe, Yoda confronted a Bpfasshi Dark Jedi on Dagobah, some years before the events in The Empire Strikes Back, and the cave where the Dark Jedi died became strong in the dark side of the Force. Star Wars Tales later retconned this event to take place earlier, with another Jedi of Yoda's species named Minch replacing Yoda. Dagobah was also visited by the main characters of the Galaxy of Fear series, where it was home for a time to a tribe of cannibals. During the events of Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, a team of Jedi Knights from the New Jedi Order visit Dagobah, to find the cave drained of its former menace. After the events of Return of the Jedi, the New Republic founded a military base on one of the greatest mountains of the planet, named 'Mount Yoda' after the Jedi Master.Davids, H & Davids, P., Star Wars: Mission From Mount Yoda, Bantam Spectra, 1993 Description Largely looked over by the Galactic Republic, Dagobah is the only habitable planet in the system of the same name within the Sluis sector. A cloudy and swampy world of dense foliage, countless living things of all sizes, including reptiles, amphibians, and swarming insects, fill its environs with a hum of constant noise. All of its creatures appear completely unintelligent. Larger life-forms occupy cave-like hollows formed by petrified forests. Carnivorous \\"gnarltrees\\" reproduce as spiderlike mobile creatures which eventually metamorphosise into their rooted form. The planet is also noted for being strong with the Force.

The company is fully owned by the Swinkels family for seven generations. The head office is located in Lieshout and there are subsidiaries in twelve countries. Swinkels Family Brewers is the second largest brewery company in the Netherlands after Heineken and one of the largest producers of malt in Europe. The business has a turnover of more than 897 million euros per year of which two thirds come from more than 130 countries outside the Netherlands. Within Europe, especially France, Belgium and Italy contribute to sales. More than a quarter of the turnover is achieved outside Europe, of which a large part in Ethiopia. Products The Lieshout brewery of Swinkels Family Brewers Pils lager Five of the La Trappe beers: Blond, Dubbel, Witte Trapist, Tripel, Quadrupel Bottle of Rodenbach beer Swinkels Family Brewers produces and markets beer, malt and soft drinks. Beer The business operates seven brewery locations: three in the Netherlands, three in Belgium and one in Ethiopia. These breweries produced over 8 million hectolitres of beer in 2019. Furthermore beer is brewed under license in nine countries. The group sells beer under several brand names, including Bavaria, Swinckels', La Trappe, and Rodenbach. About 9 percent of the total beer production consists of alcohol-free and low-alcoholic beer (less than 3.5%). Malt Swinkels Family Brewers owns two malt houses, one in Lieshout and one in Eemshaven. The annual capacity totals 395,000 tons of malt, a third of which is used by Swinkels Family Brewers itself. One third of the production is sold to third parties in Europe and one third goes to countries outside Europe, mainly to Latin America, South America and Japan. Sales of malt contribute to around fifteen percent of Swinkels Family Brewers sales. Soft drinks The company produces approximately 818,000 hectoliters of soft drinks per annum, of which almost 95 percent as private label products. Swinkels Family Brewers itself uses the brand names 3ES and B52. History Local brewery The history of Swinkels Family Brewers can be traced back to 1680. In that year Dirk Vereijken owned a brewery at the Kerkdijk (Church Dike Road) in Lieshout, proof of which can be found in an account of the municipal tax records of that year. This brewery was transferred from father to daughter for three consecutive generations. The names of the new brewing families were Van Moorsel and Moorrees. In 1764 Brigitta Moorrees married Ambrosius Swinkels. After her mother's death in 1773, Brigitta and her husband became the full owners of the brewery. Since then, the brewery has been owned by the Swinkels family. Regional brewery For centuries the brewery only produced beer for the local market. It was not until the fourth generation of Swinkels took charge of the brewery that production was expanded. Jan Swinkels, born in 1851, started distribution to the city of Helmond at from Lieshout in 1890. Sales rose from 988 hectolitres of beer in 1890 to 1,900 hectolitres in 1900. After the First World War distribution was expanded to other towns and villages in North Brabant. By 1923 output had increased to 3,325 hectolitres of beer. By that time the original brewery buildings had become too small so a larger brewery was built in Lieshout. On that occasion three brothers of the fifth generation of Swinkels took over leadership, and adopted the brand name Bavaria. This name indicated that the new plant was a bottom fermentation brewery, producing pale lager (Bavarian) beer. Nationwide distribution Distribution was broadened to include Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht, the four largest cities of the Netherlands. In 1933 the brewery added its own bottling plant, which produced 2,000 bottles an hour. By 1940 a malt house was built. The output of the brewery at the beginning of the Second World War was approximately 40,000 hectolitres per annum, with an almost nationwide coverage in distribution. In 1955 the company started manufacturing soft drinks under the brand name 3-ES. This name refers to the three Swinkels brothers of the fifth generation. In the postwar years beer consumption in the Netherlands had decreased to a very low level. It took the firm until 1959 to recover in terms of sales volume. In the sixties the company doubled its production capacity. World player From 1973 onwards the company took an interest in the exporting business, first of all in Southern Europe. In the late seventies the firm introduced alcohol-free beer, that was exported to Islamic countries. By 1981 the total volume reached 1,000,000 hectolitres of beer. From the nineties onwards the business expanded into exclusive and seasonal beers. Moreover, the company started to adapt its drinks to individual markets. Consequently, export grew to cover 130 countries. In 1999, the Trappist Koningshoeven Abbey, located in Berkel-Enschot, entered into an agreement with the Swinkels family to take over the daily operations of the monks' brewery within the abbey. The brewery, which operates as \\"De Koningshoeven NV\\", is a subsidiary of Swinkels Family Brewers, whilst the buildings and equipment remain in the ownership of the abbey. The monks remain the ultimate authority on the brewing process while Swinkels Family Brewers manages the commercial business. The beer is sold under the brandname La Trappe. On May 10, 2016 it was announced that the company N.V. has taken a majority stake in the Belgian brewery Palm. Initially the firm acquires 60% of the shares and this will be expanded to 100% in 2021. In November 2016 the company acquired Latis Imports, establishing a dedicated US presence in one of its \\"five key regions\\". In June 2018 it was decided to change the name of Bavaria to Swinkels Family Brewers. At the moment the management of the company consists of members of the seventh generation Swinkels. Royal predicate In March 2019, Wim van de Donk, Commissioner of the King of the province of Brabant, announced that Swinkels Family Brewers would from now on have the Royal predicate, officially naming the company 'Royal Swinkels Family Brewers'. It has been gained for the 300th anniversary of the company and their national significance. Price fixing conviction On April 18, 2007 The European Commission imposed punitive fines on three major European breweries for operating a price fixing cartel in the Netherlands. The three were Heineken (‚Ç¨219.3m), Grolsch (‚Ç¨31.65m) and Swinkels Family Brewers (‚Ç¨22.85m). A fourth participant in the cartel, InBev (formerly Interbrew), did not receive a penalty because it provided \\"decisive information\\" about the cartel's operations between 1996 and 1999, as well as about others in the European Union. These four brewers had control of 95% of the Dutch market, with Heineken claiming a half and the three others 15% each. EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said she was \\"very disappointed\\" that the collusion took place at the very highest (boardroom) level. She stated, \\"This is simply unacceptable: that major beer suppliers colluded to up prices and to carve up markets among themselves. She added, \\"Heineken, Grolsch, Bavaria and InBev tried to cover their tracks by using code names and abbreviations for secret meetings to carve up the market for beer sold to supermarkets, hotels, restaurants and cafes. The price fixing extended to cheaper own-brand labels and rebates for bars. World Cup Ambush Marketing campaigns At the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Swinkels Family Brewers got up to 1,000 fans of the Dutch national football team to don orange overalls, called Leeuwenhosen, with the brewery's logo on them. The Leeuwenhosen were given away with the purchase of Swinkels Family Brewers products prior to the World Cup. However the action was deemed to be an act of ambush marketing by FIFA as Swinkels Family Brewers, which was not a corporate sponsor, had not paid any money to be an official event partner. With pre-warning from FIFA officials, staff at the game versus Ivory Coast asked fans to remove the overalls upon entrance to the game and provided orange replacement shorts without any logo.Dutch fans given shorts for match (BBC News) During the 2010 FIFA World Cup, 36 women clad in orange miniskirts went to the Netherlands vs Denmark match in Johannesburg, using tickets supplied at least in part by British ITV pundit and ex- footballer Robbie Earle. Tournament officials evicted the group en masse from the stadium upon which they were arrested and held by the Police. They were released upon talks between the management of Swinkels Family Brewers and FIFA.

The most-populous municipality of the county, it had 48,231 resdents at the 2010 United States Census, with an estimated population of 64,484 as of 2019. It is named for the prominent, castle tower- shaped butte near the center of town. Midway between Denver and Colorado Springs, Castle Rock is part of the Denver metropolitan area and the Front Range Urban Corridor. History The Denver and Rio Grande Railway's Castle Rock depot (1917) The region in and around Castle Rock was originally home to the Arapaho and Cheyenne peoples. They occupied the land between the Arkansas and South Platte Rivers. White settlers were drawn to the area by rumors of gold and by land opened through the Homestead Act of 1862. However, the discovery of rhyolite stone, not gold, ultimately led to the settlement of Castle Rock. Castle Rock was founded in 1874 when the eastern Douglas County border was redrawn to its present location. Castle Rock was chosen as the county seat because of its central location. One of the first homesteaders in the area near today's Castle Rock was Jeremiah Gould. He owned about to the south of \\"the (Castle) Rock.\\" At that time, the settlement consisted of just a few buildings for prospectors, workers, and cowboys. In 1874, Gould donated to the new town, which was also now home to the Douglas County government. Six streets named Elbert, Jerry, Wilcox, Perry, Castle, and Front were laid out to build the actual town of Castle Rock. The courthouse square was defined and about 77 lots, each 50 by , were auctioned off for a total profit of US$3,400. A new train depot brought the Denver and Rio Grande Railway to the area. During the late 1800s and early 1900s, Castle Rock had a very active rhyolite quarrying industry. Many immigrants arrived in the area to work in the quarries. In 1936, the town received a donation of land that included its namesake geographical feature. Men employed by the Works Progress Administration constructed a star atop the butte shortly after Castle Rock received that donation. The star was lit every year from 1936 to 1941. After World War II began, the star was left unlit as a symbol of sacrifice in support of the war effort. On August 14, 1945, shortly after V-J Day, the star was modified into a V-for-victory symbol. On December 7, 1945, the star was lit for the holiday season. It has been lit every year since around the same time. The town's historic county courthouse, which was built in 1889‚Äì1890, burned down on March 11, 1978, the result of arson. Castle Rock's municipal government experienced significant financial difficulties during the early 1980s. In 1984, the town's voters approved a charter amendment that authorized the creation of a home-rule charter commission. The home-rule charter was finalized in 1987. The original Douglas County courthouse was one of seven buildings in Castle Rock that have been added to the National Register of Historic Places. The other buildings include Castle Rock Depot, Castle Rock Elementary School, First National Bank of Douglas County, Samuel Dyer House, Benjamin Hammer House, and Keystone Hotel. A dispute about whether the Castle Rock Police Department was required to enforce a civil restraining order was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2005. The court held, in Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales, that a municipality cannot be held liable under a federal civil-rights statute, 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1983, for failing to enforce civil restraining orders. The case had arisen from a 1999 murder of three young girls by their father outside the Castle Rock Police Department building. The children were abducted by their father, in violation of the restraining order that had been obtained by their mother, within several hours of being killed. The mother had asked the Castle Rock police to enforce the restraining order, by finding and apprehending the father after he removed the children from her home and before the murders. Castle Rock police officers declined to do so, refusing even to contact the Denver Police Department after the mother notified them that the father had taken the children to an amusement park in that city. Geography The town of Castle Rock is named after this prominent castle tower-shaped butte. Castle Rock is located at (39.372212, ‚àí104.856090) at an elevation of 6,224 feet (1,897 m). Castle Rock is in central Colorado at the junction of Interstate 25 and State Highway 86, south of downtown Denver and north of Colorado Springs. The town lies a few miles east of the Rampart Range of the Rocky Mountains on the western edge of the Great Plains. Castle Rock, the butte for which the town is named, is just north of the town center. Other prominent landforms visible from Castle Rock include Dawson Butte, Devils Head, Mount Evans, and Pikes Peak. East Plum Creek, a stream within the South Platte River watershed, flows generally north through Castle Rock. Hangman's Gulch, which runs northwest then west around the north side of the town center, drains into East Plum Creek, as do multiple unnamed gulches in the southern and western areas of town. McMurdo Gulch and Mitchell Gulch run north then northeast through eastern Castle Rock and drain into Cherry Creek east of town. Castle Rock is in the Colorado Foothills Life Zone. The hillsides are covered with meadows of grass, small plants, scattered juniper trees and open ponderosa pine woodlands. Other trees common in the area include Gambel oak (scrub oak or oak brush) and pinyon pine. Local wildlife includes the American badger, American black bear, bobcat, coyote, Colorado chipmunk, crow, garter snakes, gray fox, mountain cottontail rabbit, mountain lion, mule deer, pocket gopher, porcupine, skunk, and tadpoles. Birds found in the area include the golden eagle, peregrine falcon, sharp-shinned hawk, black-billed magpie, red-tailed hawk, pinyon jay, and western tanager. According to the United States Census Bureau, Castle Rock has an area of , all of it land. Lying within the Front Range Urban Corridor, the town is part of the greater Denver metropolitan area. Castle Rock borders three communities, all to its north; from west to east, they are Castle Pines Village, the city of Castle Pines, and The Pinery. Other nearby communities include Franktown to the east, Larkspur to the south, Perry Park to the southwest, and Sedalia to the northwest. Climate Castle Rock has a semiarid climate (K√∂ppen BSk) with cold, dry, snowy winters, and hot, wetter summers. On average, the town receives of precipitation annually. Annual snowfall averages . January is the coldest month, July the hottest, and August the month with the most precipitation. The hottest temperature recorded in Castle Rock was in July 1973; the coldest was in January 1963. Statewide, Colorado has experienced an average temperature increase of about over the past half-century. Given its location in the center of the state, it is expected that Castle Rock will experience continuing warming and higher average temperatures this century. Daily minimum temperatures are also expected to continue rising, as they have for the past 30 years. The town will also likely experience less snowfall, earlier snowmelt and runoff during the spring, and increased water uptake by plants.

Castle Rock is the 17th most populous municipality in Colorado and is the center of the burgeoning urbanization of the county. Economy Because of its Front Range location between Denver and its inner suburbs and Colorado Springs, many of Castle Rock's residents commute nearly 20 miles to northern Colorado Springs or the Denver Technological Center, better known as \\"The Denver Tech Center\\" (DTC), which is an 18-mile drive north on I-25, with Downtown Denver roughly 30 miles north, and Denver International Airport about 45 miles north. In fact, about 80% of Castle Rock residents commute out of town to work. The average one-way commute time for a Castle Rock resident is about 29 minutes, longer than the U.S. average. One reason for this is that the town has not yet attracted the variety or extent of employers needed to significantly lower the number of commuters to work outside Castle Rock. The town has relatively little land zoned for industrial or light industrial use, with the vast majority of the land within town limits dedicated to residential construction only. As of 2011, 78.2% of the population over the age of 16 was in the labor force, 0.4% was in the armed forces, and 77.7% was in the civilian labor force, with 72.6% employed and 5.1% unemployed. The employed civilian labor force was 48.0% in management, business, science, and arts; 25.8% in sales and office occupations; 14.7% in service occupations; 6.4% in natural resources, construction, and maintenance; and 5.2% in production, transportation, and material moving. The three industries employing the largest proportion of the working civilian labor force were educational services, health care, and social assistance (15.5%); professional, scientific, and management, and administrative and waste management services (13.2%); and finance and insurance, and real estate and rental and leasing (12.6%). Castle Rock's cost of living is above average. Compared to a U.S. average of 100, the cost of living index for the town is 137.2. As of mid-2019, the median home value in the town was $427,537. The median gross monthly rent for an apartment was about $1,461. The town's housing base continues to grow. About 1,400 permits to build new homes were issued in 2018. Government and politics Castle Rock Town Hall (2010) Castle Rock is a home rule municipality with a council‚Äìmanager form of government. The Town's governing body is the Town Council, made up of seven members including the mayor and mayor pro-tem. Each councilmember is elected to represent an election district, and the mayor is elected to represent the Town at large. One member, appointed by the council, serves as the mayor pro-tem. Castle Rock voters approved a change to the town charter that authorized an at-large mayor in 2017. The mayor presides over council meetings and casts one vote, like other councilmembers. The council sets policy for the town, adopts ordinances, approves the town budget, makes major land-use decisions, and appoints key town government staff including the town manager, town attorney, municipal judge, and members of town boards and commissions. The town manager supervises all departments, prepares and implements the town budget, and works with the council to develop policies and propose new plans. Tax revenues are used to provide general government, fire, police, parks maintenance and programs, street maintenance and operations, support for recreation, and planning and code enforcement services. The town also provides development services, golf, water, and sewer services to residents through self-supporting enterprise funds. The average annual municipal property tax bill of a Castle Rock resident is $40.66. That is in addition to property taxes assessed by Douglas County and other entities. As the county seat, Castle Rock is the administrative center of Douglas County. The county courthouse, the Douglas County Justice Center, is north of downtown, and most departments of the county government base their operations in the town. As of 2013, Castle Rock lies within Colorado's 4th U.S. Congressional District. The town is in the 4th district of the Colorado Senate and the 45th district of the Colorado House of Representatives. Castle Rock is the county seat of Douglas County, a Republican stronghold in Colorado. Education Primary and secondary education Douglas County School District is based in Castle Rock and operates 18 public schools in the town. These include ten elementary schools, two middle schools, two charter schools, one magnet school, one alternative high school, and two high schools: Castle View High School and Douglas County High School. In addition, there are three private primary schools in Castle Rock. School board elections in Douglas County are held in odd-numbered years. In recent years the community has experienced a spirited debate between supporters of significant change in the management of local schools and those who oppose such changes or believe they should advance at a slower pace. Libraries The Douglas County Libraries public library system is based in Castle Rock, co-located with the local branch library, the Philip S. Miller Library, south of downtown. The Miller Library includes the Douglas County History Research Center and offers several educational and recreational programs to the public. Infrastructure Transportation Interstate 25 and U.S. Route 87 run concurrently north- south through Castle Rock. U.S. Route 85, also a north-south route, enters the town from the northwest, meeting I-25 at Exit 184; south of the exit, it runs concurrently with I-25 and U.S. 87. Colorado State Highway 86, an east-west route, enters Castle Rock from the east, then turns north and west as Founders Parkway, terminating at its junction with I-25 at Exit 184. For local transportation within Castle Rock, the town government sponsors a voucher program for reduced-fare taxi service. This service is available to town residents who are disabled or who do not have access to a vehicle. In addition, the Castle Rock Senior Center offers a shuttle service for resident senior citizens. Castle Rock does not participate in the Denver metropolitan area's Regional Transportation District. Municipal voters decided in November 2005 to opt the town out of RTD. As a result, neither bus nor light rail service to Denver or any of its other suburbs is available from Castle Rock. BNSF Railway and Union Pacific Railroad each have a freight rail line that runs through Castle Rock. Both lines run parallel to U.S. 85. Utilities and water The Intermountain Rural Electric Association, based in nearby Sedalia, provides electric power. Black Hills Energy provides natural gas service. Waste Management and other businesses provide trash removal. The town government's Utilities Department oversees water provision, distribution, and infrastructure maintenance. Historically, nearly all of the water needed by Castle Rock residents was pumped from aquifers below the ground, including the Denver Basin aquifer. Beginning in 2013, when the town developed its first strategic plan for the management of water, Castle Rock has moved toward more use of surface water. Between 2006 and 2018 per capita water use in Castle Rock declined from 137 gallons to 115 gallons. Starting in 2020, Castle Rock expects to begin treating sink, tap, and toilet water to drinkable water quality standards so that it can be reused. The town aims to achieve a goal of reliance upon renewable water resources for 75% of municipal needs by 2050 and, by 2020, about one-third of all water used in Castle Rock is expected to be from a reusable source. As of July 2019 Castle Rock, Denver, and Pitkin County are the first three Colorado municipal or county governments to adopt a state regulation governing greywater reuse. Health care Castle Rock has several medical offices, an urgent care and an emergency room. Castle Rock Adventist Hospital, a full-service hospital, opened on August 1, 2013.

It remains under construction. The park is named after a local banker and philanthropist who, with his wife, Jerry, left trust monies to Castle Rock in the mid-1990s. The Phillip S. Miller Activity Center is included in the park's 300 acres. The Castle Rock Historical Museum is in the former Denver and Rio Grande Railway depot building on Elbert Street. This building is purported to have been built in 1875. It is made of rhyolite taken from local quarries. The museum depicts how Castle Rock has changed over the years.

It is: \\"A taking in hand, a bearing up or upholding of quarrels or sides, to the disturbance of the common right.\\"Coke (1641) Institutes *Champerty (from Old French champart, a feudal lord's share of produce) is the \\"maintenance\\" of a person in a lawsuit on condition that the subject matter of the action is to be shared with the maintainer. Among laymen, this is known as litigation finance. In Giles v Thompson Lord Justice Steyn declared: \\"In modern idiom maintenance is the support of litigation by a stranger without just cause. Champerty is an aggravated form of maintenance. The distinguishing feature of champerty is the support of litigation by a stranger in return for a share of the proceeds.\\" At common law, maintenance and champerty were both crimes and torts, as was barratry (the bringing of vexatious litigation). This is generally no longer soAbolished by Part II of the Criminal Law Act 1967, except as regards embracery, abolished by section 17 of the Bribery Act 2010. as, during the nineteenth century, the development of legal ethics tended to obviate the risks to the public, particularly after the scandal of the Swynfen will case (1856‚Äì1864). However, the principles are relevant to modern contingent fee agreements between a lawyer and a client and to the assignment by a plaintiff of his rights in a lawsuit to someone with no connection to the case. Champertous contracts can still, depending on jurisdiction, be void for public policy or attract liability for costs. History The restrictions arose to combat abuses in medieval England. Unscrupulous nobles and royal officials would lend their names to bolster the credibility of doubtful and fraudulent claims in return for a share of the property recovered.Winfield (1919) Speaking extrajudicially in the early seventeenth century, Lord Chief Justice Coke described the origins of maintenance in this way:1 Coke Litt 368b, cited in Friston, M, Civil Costs Law and Practice (2nd ed), Jordans, The comments were made in context of the court previously having been anxious to prevent a wide range of maintenance; the phrase \\"maintenance\\" had been used to apply not just to those who gave support in civil claims, but also to those who sought to maintain robbers, heretics and even \\"a new sect coming from beyond the sea, clad in white garments\\".Friston, M, Civil Costs Law and Practice (2nd ed), Jordans, Judicial independence was gradually established, however, and by the early 19th century Jeremy Bentham wrote:Works (Bowring (ed), 1843) vol 3, pp 19‚Äì20 By jurisdiction Australia In Australia, champerty and maintenance as common law causes of action (as either a crime or a tort) have mostly been abolished by statute. In New South Wales, champerty and maintenance were abolished by the Maintenance, Champerty and Barratry Abolition Act 1993. In Victoria, champerty and maintenance was abolished as a tort by section 32 of the Wrongs Act 1958, and as a crime by section 332A of the Crimes Act 1958.  Canada  In Canada, the common law crimes of champerty and maintenance were abolished, alongside all remaining common law offences except contempt of court, by the 1953 consolidation of the Criminal Code. However, champerty and maintenance remain torts in some Canadian jurisdictions. In Ontario, champertous agreements are invalid under the Champerty Act, RSO 1897, c. 327. England and Wales Maintenance and champerty have not been crimes or torts since the passing of the Criminal Law Act 1967,Criminal Law Act 1967, ss.13-14 though embracery was a crime until the Bribery Act 2010. However, the 1967 Act stated: There are circumstances in which a non-party who funds litigation can be liable for costs, if the action fails.Superior Courts Act 1981, s.51(1) and (3)Aiden Shipping Co Ltd v. Interbulk Ltd [1986] AC 965Arkin v Bouchard Lines [2005] EWCA Civ 655 For instance, in Re Oasis Merchandising Services Ltd[1998] Ch 170 the Court of Appeal reincarnated the tort against the assignment of a wrongful trading claim by a liquidator to a specialist litigation company to pursuing directors for wrongful trading. This has come under criticism given that claims against directors are enforced sub-optimally as company liquidators, typically accountants, are cautious to take on risks rather than save as much of the company as possible. UK criminal and civil law The common law was amended by two acts of law, the Serious Crimes Act 2007 section 44 to section 46. The act replaces the common law crime of incitement with a statutory offence of encouraging or assisting crime. While at common law there is still perverting and tending to pervert the course of public justice, and malicious prosecutions, which is abuse of process laws. The Criminal Justice Act 1967 at section 5 regulated concealments and giving false information. The law recognises fundamental dishonesty, and dishonesty, the matters in law, relates to the \\"Cause\\". The term \\"fundamental dishonesty\\" was first coined in the April 2013 amendments to the CPR, The CJC recommended that the definition in Brighton & Hove Bus & Coach Co Ltd v Brooks [2011] EWHC 2504 (Admin) should form the basis of any definition of fraud to be used in removing claims (even if partly valid due to parity) from an unsuccessful claimant. On the basis which is well known in relation to fraud: * the fraud must be pleaded by the defendant; * statements and representations must have been made that were false; * that were likely to interfere with the course of justice in some material respect; and * at the time they were made the maker had no honest belief in their truth and knew they were likely to interfere with the course of justice. The CJC explicitly rejected the suggestion that anything short of fraud, such as exaggerations or perception of a truth. (See Lord Denning in Lazarus Estates Ltd v Beasley CA QB 702, [1956] 1 All ER 341.) In law, common purpose or joint enterprise is a liability of those aiding, paying, planning and partaking in the crime or wrong. The Observance of Due Process of Law, a 1368 act of Edward III, said \\"eschew the Mischiefs and Damages done to divers of his Commons by false Accusers, which oftentimes have made their Accusations more for Revenge and singular Benefit, than for the Profit of the King, or of his People, which accused Persons...\\" Therefore, the crime exists where the course of justice is perverted that there was no good faith and that the others supporting them knew that the claim was false and had concealed this facts and aided in the perversion itself. Due to \\"old law\\" the crime extended to solicitors, prosecutors and police as well as the private individuals and witnesses. which will and can fall also as perjury. To champion a cause which is known to be unlawful, false, and an abuse, is champerty and maintenance. Maintenance is not only monies (funding), but in the loss to others from the venture. Hong Kong In Hong Kong, champerty and maintenance were long thought to be obsolete both as a crime and a tort, but these two principles have been revived in recent years in response to the prevalence of recovery agents which present problems quite different from the mischief which historically these rules intended to combat. The recovery agents typically perform \\"ambulance chasing\\" on accident victims, offering to arrange lawyers to handle their claims on a \\"no win no fee\\" basis. If the claim succeeds the recovery agents share a portion of the damages. This is seen as deception on uneducated victims who are ignorant to the availability of legal aid. The division of the damages in effect deprives the victims of the just compensation that they are entitled to for their bodily injury. The intermeddling of recovery agents in the lawsuit also presents ethical problems to lawyers, who may have undermined impartiality in advising on settlement. In response, the Department of Justice and the Law Society of Hong Kong carried out a massive publicity campaign aiming at educating the public to refuse recovery agents, citing that maintenance and champerty are criminal offences under the laws of Hong Kong. In 2008, 21 people were arrested for champerty, maintenance and conspiracy. They were recovery agents \\"helping\\" accident victims on a \\"no win no fee\\" basis. One of the people arrested was a lawyer. Champerty and maintenance carries a sentence of up to seven years in Hong Kong.Caution issued on recovery agents ÂåÖÊî¨Ë®¥Ë®üÂ±¨Âàë‰∫ãÂèØÂà§Âõö On 25 June 2009, Winnie Lo Wai Yan, a solicitor, was convicted for conspiracy to maintain and a recovery agent was convicted for conspiracy to champer. She was found to have agreed to share 25% from the damages paid to the next friend of an 18-year-old traffic accident victim who suffered from permanent total loss of earning capacity. On 10 July 2009, Lo was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment and the recovery agent was sentenced to 16 months' imprisonment (Case number: DCCC 610/2008). Lo appealed in the same year and on 3 December 2010, her appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal (Case number: CACC 254/2009). On 30 January 2012, Lo's conviction was quashed in the Court of Final Appeal (Case number: FACC 2/2011). The Reasons for Judgment, published on 23 February 2012, stated that there is a serious problem with the finding made and endorsed by the trial judge and the Court of Appeal respectively that Lo knew that there had been champerty involved. Although the judge found maintenance and champerty are constitutional, he questioned whether criminal liability for maintenance should be retained in Hong Kong as liability for both maintenance and champerty were abolished in places such as England and South Australia. On 26 March 2013, Louie Mui Kwok-keung, a barrister, was sentenced in the District Court to 3.5 years of imprisonment. He pleaded not guilty on 18 February 2013, to five counts of champerty and maintenance, allegedly committed between 1999 and 2008. He was the first barrister in the city to be convicted of such crimes (Case number: DCCC 890/2012). Ireland The Maintenance and Embracery Act 1634 passed by the Parliament of Ireland provides that \\"all statutes heretofore made in England concerning maintenance, champerty and embracery, or any of them now standing and being in their full strength and force, shall be put in due execution in this realme of Ireland\\". Poynings' Law had already imported all English statues up to 1495; the 1634 act additionally imported the Maintenance and Embracery Act 1540. The 1634 and 1540 acts are still in force in the Republic of Ireland. In 2015 Persona, which lost to Esat Digifone in a 1997 telecoms bidding process criticised by the Moriarty Tribunal, applied to launch a lawsuit against those involved in the 1997 bidding, to be funded by a UK company, Harbour Litigation Funding, in return for part of any damages awarded. In 2016, the High Court ruled that such third-party funding constituted champerty prohibited by the 1634 act; Persona said it would have to drop the case, being unable to afford the ‚Ç¨10m expenses. New Zealand Maintenance and champerty are torts, not crimes, under New Zealand law. Despite calls for their abolition, the New Zealand Law Commission recommended their preservation in a 2001 report titled Subsidising Litigation., pages 2 and 11.

Button laws that overburden free speech rights in the name of preventing champerty were found to be unconstitutional.NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415 Courts in Florida have found that the causes of action for maintenance and champerty are no longer viable in Florida, but have been superseded by laws related to abuse of process, malicious prosecution, and wrongful initiation of litigation.See e.g., Hardick v. Homol, 795 So.2d 1107 (Fla. 5th DCA 2001). Florida courts have held that champerty and maintenance may continue to exist as affirmative defenses, but only as to the enforceability of the champertous contract itself.See e.g., Malibu Media LLC v. Zumbo, 2014 WL 2742830 (M.D. Fla. 2014) (not reported in F.Supp.3d). See also * Litigation funding * Subpoena ad testificandum Notes References * Rancman v.

Khat contains the alkaloid cathinone, a stimulant, which is said to cause excitement, loss of appetite, and euphoria. Among communities from the areas where the plant is native, khat chewing has a history as a social custom dating back thousands of years analogous to the use of coca leaves in South America and betel nut in Asia. The World Health Organization (WHO) classified it in 1980 as a drug of abuse that can produce psychological dependence, although the WHO does not consider khat addiction to be a serious problem. The legality of khat varies by region. In many countries, khat might not be a specifically controlled substance but may nevertheless be illegal under more general laws. It is a specifically controlled substance in some countries including Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. By contrast, the production, sale, and consumption are legal in the nations where its use is traditional of those cultures, including Djibouti, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Somalia and Yemen. In Israel, which hosts a population of Yemenite Jews, only the consumption of the plant's leaves in its natural state is permitted.Sadeh ve'yerek ‚Äì Newspaper of the Vegetable Growers Association, Issue 230, Tel-Aviv (March 2011).

It is also known as jimaa in the Oromo language, mayirungi in Luganda, and as miraa in Kenya. Khat has been grown for use as a stimulant for centuries in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. There, chewing khat predates the use of coffee and is used in a similar social context. In Uganda it is grown in the central region, especially in Kasenge (Wakiso), Butambala District, Mabira Forest, and in some parts of the western region of the country . In Kenya it is grown in Meru County. Although the practice of khat-chewing is still primarily restricted to its original area of cultivation in the Red Sea area, the khat plant has over the years found its way to Southern Africa as well as tropical areas, where it grows on rocky outcrops and in woodlands. The shrub is today scattered in the KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape, Western Cape and Mpumalanga provinces of South Africa, in addition to Swaziland and Mozambique. Its fresh leaves and tops are chewed or, less frequently, dried and consumed as tea, to achieve a state of euphoria and stimulation; it also has anorectic (appetite-reducing) side effects. The leaves or the soft part of the stem can be chewed with either chewing gum or fried peanuts to make it easier to chew. In recent years, however, improved roads, off-road motor vehicles, and air transportation have increased the global distribution of this perishable commodity, and as a result, the plant has been reported in England, Wales, Rome, Amsterdam, Canada, Israel, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. In the US, freshly packed khat leaves are sold on the markets of New York, Los Angeles, Boston, and Dallas, where the demand is highest.Zecharia Madar, \\"The Khat Phenomenon in Yemen and the Dangers it Poses\\", in: Ascending the Palm Tree ‚Äì An Anthology of the Yemenite Jewish Heritage, Rachel Yedid & Danny Bar-Maoz (ed.), E'ele BeTamar: Rehovot 2018, p. 144 Traditionally, khat is used as a socialising drug as in Yemen where khat-chewing is predominantly a male habit. DEA in July 2006 Khat is so popular in Yemen that its cultivation consumes much of the country's agricultural resources. An estimated 40% of Yemen's water supply goes towards irrigating it, with production increasing by about 10% to 15% every year. One \\"daily bag\\" of khat requires an estimated of water to produce. Water consumption is high and groundwater levels in the Sanaa basin are diminishing, so government officials have proposed relocating large portions of the population of Sana'a to the coast of the Red Sea. One reason for khat being cultivated in Yemen so widely is the high income it provides for farmers. Some studies done in 2001 estimated that the income from cultivating khat was about 2.5 million Yemeni rials per hectare, while fruits brought only 0.57 million rials per hectare. Between 1970 and 2000, the area on which khat was cultivated was estimated to have grown from 8,000 to 103,000 hectares. In 2000, according to a World Bank estimate, khat accounted for 30% of Yemen's economy. In other countries, outside of its core area of growth and consumption, khat is sometimes chewed at parties or social functions. It may also be used by farmers and labourers for reducing physical fatigue or hunger, and by drivers and students for improving attention. It takes seven to eight years for the khat plant to reach its full height. Other than access to sun and water, khat requires little maintenance. Ground water is often pumped from deep wells by diesel engines to irrigate the crops, or brought in by water trucks. The plants are watered heavily starting around a month before they are harvested to make the leaves and stems soft and moist. A good khat plant can be harvested four times a year, providing a year-long source of income for the farmer. More recently, in 2019, reports indicate that child soldiers in Yemen have been chewing khat in order to remain alert on the battlefield. Health effects delphic analysis regarding 20 popular recreational drugs. Khat was ranked 17th in dependence, 20th in physical harm, and 20th in social harm. Khat consumption induces mild euphoria and excitement, similar to that conferred by strong coffee. Individuals become very talkative under the influence of the plant. Animal testing has shown that khat causes an increase in motoric activity. The effects of oral administration of cathinone occur more rapidly than the effects of amphetamine pills; roughly 15 minutes as compared to 30 minutes in amphetamine. Khat can induce manic behaviours and hyperactivity, similar in effects to those produced by amphetamine. The use of khat results in constipation. Dilated pupils (mydriasis) are prominent during khat consumption, reflecting the sympathomimetic effects of the drug, which are also reflected in increased heart rate and blood pressure. Long-term use can precipitate permanent tooth darkening (of a greenish tinge), susceptibility to ulcers, and diminished sex drive. Khat is an effective anorectic, causing loss of appetite. It is unclear if the consumption of khat directly affects the mental health of the user or not. Occasionally, a psychotic episode can result, resembling a hypomanic state in presentation. As to its positive effects, khat acts as a refrigerant for the stomach and the liver, and relieves biliousness. In humans, its prolonged consumption creates an uplifted mood and a sense of release from time and space.

However, the attribution was disputed by reports showing the plant extracts from fresh leaves contained another substance more behaviourally active than cathine. In 1975, the related alkaloid cathinone was isolated, and its absolute configuration was established in 1978. Cathinone is not very stable and breaks down to produce cathine and norephedrine. These chemicals belong to the PPA (phenylpropanolamine) family, a subset of the phenethylamines related to amphetamines and the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine. In fact, cathinone and cathine have a very similar molecular structure to amphetamine. Khat is sometimes confused with methcathinone (also known as cat), a Schedule I substance that possesses a similar chemical structure to the khat plant's cathinone active component. However, both the side effects and the addictive properties of methcathinone are much stronger than those associated with khat use. When khat leaves dry, the more potent chemical, cathinone, decomposes within 48 hours, leaving behind the milder chemical, cathine. Thus, harvesters transport khat by packaging the fresh leaves and stems in plastic bags or wrapping them in banana leaves to preserve their moisture and keep the cathinone potent. It is also common for them to sprinkle the plant with water frequently or use refrigeration during transportation. When the khat leaves are chewed, cathine and cathinone are released and absorbed through the mucous membranes of the mouth as well as the lining of the stomach. The action of cathine and cathinone on the reuptake of epinephrine and norepinephrine has been demonstrated in lab animals, showing that one or both of these chemicals cause(s) the body to recycle these neurotransmitters more slowly, resulting in the wakefulness and insomnia associated with khat use. Receptors for serotonin show a high affinity for cathinone, suggesting this chemical is responsible for feelings of euphoria associated with chewing khat. In mice, cathinone produces the same types of nervous pacing or repetitive scratching behaviours associated with amphetamines. The effects of cathinone peak after 15 to 30 minutes, with nearly 98% of the substance metabolised into norephedrine by the liver. Cathine is somewhat less understood, being believed to act upon the adrenergic receptors causing the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine. It has a half-life of about three hours in humans. The medication bromocriptine can reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms within 24 hours. Demographics Man in Mogadishu dividing khat into bunches for guests in preparation for a long evening of tea, conversation and chewing An estimated 5 to 10 million people globally use khat on a daily basis. It is grown principally by communities in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian peninsula, where khat-chewing has a long history as a social custom dating back thousands of years. The traditional form of khat chewing in Yemen involves only male users; khat chewing by females is less formal and less frequent. Researchers estimate about 70‚Äì80% of Yemenis between 16 and 50 years old chew khat, at least on occasion. Approximately 60‚Äì90% of male and 35% of female Yemenis chew khat daily. Prior to Yemeni unification in 1990, khat chewing was largely confined to the north- west mountains of the country, where khat grows. Yemenis spend an estimated 14.6 million man-hours per day chewing khat. Researchers have also estimated that families spend about 17% of their income on khat. History According to some sources, khat was first grown in Ethiopia, with the explorer Sir Richard Burton suggesting the plant was later introduced to Yemen from Ethiopia in the 15th century. He specifically mentions the eastern city of Harar as the birthplace of the plant. Man chewing khat in Sana'a, Yemen (January 2009) However, amongst communities in the Horn of Africa (Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia) and the Arabian Peninsula, khat-chewing has a long history as a social custom dating back thousands of years. Ancient Egyptian imperial cults considered the khat plant a sacred substance, which was capable of realizing a user's divinity. These early Egyptians consumed the plant ceremoniously in attempts to transcend into \\"apotheosis\\" and or garner and manifest mystical experiences, systemic trances, and other metaphysical experiences rather than habitual recreational use or abuse. Sufis also used it to intensify their mystical experience and to facilitate a sense of union with God.‚ÄúKhat in the Western Indian Ocean ‚Äì Regional Linkages and Disjunctures‚Äù Neil Carrier et Lisa Gezon, 42‚Äì43  2009 : Plantes et Soci√©t√©s, pp. 271‚Äì97. The earliest known documented description of khat is found in the Kitab al- Saidala fi al-Tibb , an 11th-century work on pharmacy and materia medica written by Ab≈´ RayhƒÅn al-Bƒ´r≈´nƒ´, a Persian scientist and biologist. Unaware of its origins, al-Bƒ´r≈´nƒ´ wrote that khat is: In 1854, Malay author Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir noted that the custom of chewing khat was prevalent in Al Hudaydah in Yemen: In 1856, English writer Charles Dickens also described the custom of khat chewing in the Horn region and the adjacent Gulf territories, likening it to drinking strong green tea: Harari men consuming khat in the street of Harar, Ethiopia Nowadays khat consumption is limited to East Africa and South Western Arabia. These countries include Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia (includes Somaliland), Uganda, and Yemen. The author Yousif Al Zarouni writes in his book: Following a ban on khat in the British-governed Aden Protectorate, the QƒÅt Commission of Inquiry in Aden concluded: \\"QƒÅt does not create an addiction, like opium or hashish, in that those who are suddenly deprived of it, do not suffer physical consequences.\\" Regulation In 1965, the World Health Organization (WHO) Expert Committee on Dependence-producing Drugs' Fourteenth Report noted, \\"The Committee was pleased to note the resolution of the Economic and Social Council with respect to khat, confirming the view that the abuse of this substance is a regional problem and may best be controlled at that level.\\" For this reason, khat was not scheduled under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. In 1980, the WHO classified the plant as a drug of abuse that can produce mild to moderate psychological dependence (less than tobacco or alcohol), although the WHO does not consider khat to be seriously addictive. It is a controlled or illegal substance in some countries, but is legal for sale and production in others.see Law Library of Congress (May 2015) Legal status of khat in selected jurisdictions Africa =Ethiopia= Khat market in Ethiopia Khat is legal in Ethiopia. =Somalia= Khat is legal in Somalia. =Djibouti= Khat is legal in Djibouti.Thomson Gale (Firm), Countries of the World and Their Leaders Yearbook 2007, Volume 1, (Thomson Gale: 2006), p. 545. =Kenya= Khat is legal in Kenya. However, two of its active components, cathinone and cathine, are classed as Class C substances. =South Africa= In South Africa, Catha edulis is a protected tree. The use of khat is illegal. =Uganda= Miraa is legal in Uganda but efforts are underway (as of October 2015) to ban it. Asia =Bangladesh= Khat is illegal in Bangladesh. =China= Khat is illegal in China. =Hong Kong= Khat is regarded as a dangerous drug in Hong Kong. Traffickers can face a penalty up to HK$5 million as well as life imprisonment. =Israel= Khat, called \\"Gat\\" in Israel, is consumed mainly by Yemenite Jews. The activity of chewing its leaves is called \\"lehazen\\" (◊ú◊õ◊ñ◊ü he). The process of chewing the Gat can take up to several hours. Some chew the Gat in a gathering which is called \\"tahazina\\" (◊™◊õ◊ñ◊ô◊†◊î he). The Gat is grown traditionally in private gardens, but it may be found in some markets. The Gat is legal in Israel as long as it‚Äôs consumed in its natural form, a fact that makes distillation of its components illegal. Some use the plant as a hedge since it‚Äôs evergreen. In 2003, Hagigat, a pill based on extracted cathinone, began to be sold in kiosks in Israel. Following several cases of hospitalisation, the Israeli Ministry of Health classified cathinone as a dangerous drug, and Hagigat was outlawed. The plant itself is allowed to be chewed and sold in its natural state, as no harm was found in normal quantities. A cocktail of Arak and minced frozen khat, mixed with grapefruit juice, has become popular in the south of the country in recent years. However, as of June 2012, the Israeli anti-drug authority announced that beverages containing Khat are considered illegal as per the dangerous drug ordinance of the state of Israel. nrg =Indonesia= Khat is illegal in Indonesia. =Malaysia= Khat is illegal in Malaysia. =Philippines= Khat is illegal in the Philippines. =Saudi Arabia= Khat is illegal in Saudi Arabia. =Thailand= Khat is legal in Thailand. =United Arab Emirates= Khat is illegal in the United Arab Emirates under federal law number 14 of 1995 on the Countermeasures against Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. Schedule No. 4, Part 2(5), provides for the prohibition of the cultivation and possession of Khat (Catha Edulis). The possession and selling of Khat may lead to life imprisonment. =Yemen= Khat is legal in Yemen. However, cultivation of the crop and the selling of its leaves are governed by a series of regulations. In 2007, the Yemeni government passed a law that restricted the cultivation of khat in a number of agricultural flatlands and basins with high water stress. The Law Concerning the General Sales Tax in 2005 also set the tax rate on khat at 20% of its retail price. The widespread cultivation of khat in Yemen has exacerbated a severe water shortage. Khat is much more water-intensive to grow than other crops. It has also played a major role in a famine in the country. Europe =Belgium= Khat has been illegal in Belgium since 2006. =Denmark= Khat has been illegal in Denmark since 1993. In 2009, the Danish Health Authority investigated khat use among Somalis in Denmark. A questionnaire with 848 respondents was used. The responses indicated that 48% of Somali males and 16% of females used the narcotic on a monthly basis and that 29% of males and 6% of females used it two times or more a week. Half the respondents had never used khat. The responses indicated that Somalis constituted the great majority of users in Denmark. The report also investigated attitudes towards khat use among Somalis in Denmark. In total, two out of three respondents stated that khat is a problem for social integration into Danish society, while one in three users stated the same. Responses indicated that two out of three considered khat to be part of Somali culture, although two in three also stated that they agree that khat should be banned in Denmark. =Finland= Khat is classified as an illegal drug in Finland, and possession, use and sale of the substance is prohibited and punishable. As with all illegal drugs, operating a motor vehicle with detectable levels of Khat or its metabolites in one's system can also lead to a conviction for driving under the influence, even if the driver does not appear intoxicated. =France= Khat is prohibited in France as a stimulant. =Germany= In Germany, cathinone is listed as a \\"non- trafficable substance\\", which makes the possession, sale and purchase of fresh khat illegal. The derivative cathine is only available on prescription, while norephedrine is not listed. In 2017, 5815 kg khat was discovered by customs officials in Frankfurt. In June 2018, 324 kg khat was discovered in packages from East Africa. =Iceland= In August 2010 the Icelandic police intercepted khat smuggling for the first time. 37 kg were confiscated. The drugs were most likely intended for sale in Canada. Again in May 2011 the police intercepted around 60 kg. =Ireland= Khat is a controlled drug for the purpose of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 and Schedule 1 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1988. As such its unauthorised possession and supply is prohibited. =Italy= Khat is inserted in the Table I of the Italian official list of psychoactive drugs under the name \\"Catha edulis pianta\\" (it. Catha edulis plant) and thus possession is prohibited. =Netherlands= In the areas of Netherlands, the active ingredients of khat, cathine and cathinone, are qualified as hard drugs and forbidden. Use is mostly limited to the Somali community. In 2008 health minister Ab Klink decided against qualifying the unprocessed plant as drugs after consultation with experts. However, on 9 January 2012 the Dutch government announced a ban on khat. =Norway= In Norway, khat is classified as a narcotic drug and is illegal to use, sell and possess. Most users are Somali immigrants and khat is smuggled from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Norwegian Customs seized 10 metric tons of khat in 2010, an increase from less than 4 in 2006. In 2016, Oslo municipality estimated 50‚Äì70% of Somali immigrant males to be habitual users. =Poland= In Poland, khat is a classified narcotic drug, and is illegal to use, sell and possess. =Romania= Khat is illegal in Romania. =Slovenia= Khat is classified as an illegal drug in Slovenia. =Sweden= The drug was prohibited in Sweden in 1989, without research. In 2007, it was estimated that 30% of Somali males in Sweden were using khat. Smuggling seizures by police amounted to about 9 tonnes annually. =Switzerland= In Switzerland, khat is illegal. It is classified as a narcotic drug. =United Kingdom= Khat was made illegal in the UK on 24 June 2014. Concerns had been expressed by commentators, health professionals and community members about the use of khat in the UK, particularly by immigrants from Somalia, Yemen and Ethiopia. Studies of the effects of khat use by immigrants on their mental health suggested that there was a need for better research on khat-chewing and its possible link with psychiatric disorders; it also suggested that public discourse on the issue displayed elements of a moral panic. Some Somali community organisations also campaigned for khat to be banned. As a result of these concerns, the Home Office commissioned successive research studies to look into the matter, and in 2005, presented the question of khat's legal status before the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs. The study concluded that most of the participants who were using khat were using it moderately in terms of both the quantity used and the frequency and duration of chewing sessions, and that khat use was typically a social activity. Only a small minority of the study participants' khat use was judged to be excessive. After a careful review of the evidence, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs recommended in January 2006 that the status of khat as a legal substance should remain for the time being. In 2008, Conservative politician Sayeeda Warsi stated that a future Conservative government would ban khat. The website of the Conservative Party, which in 2010 became the larger party in a UK coalition government, previously stated that a Conservative government would \\"Tackle unacceptable cultural practices by\\", amongst other measures, \\"classifying Khat\\". In 2009, the Home Office commissioned two new studies in the effects of khat use and in June 2010, a Home Office spokesperson stated: \\"The Government is committed to addressing any form of substance misuse and will keep the issue of khat use under close scrutiny\\". During a parliamentary debate on the legality issue on 11 January 2012, Mark Lancaster, the Conservative Member of Parliament for Milton Keynes, stated that the importation of Khat into the UK stands at 10 tonnes every week. On 23 January 2013, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) said there was \\"insufficient evidence\\" that khat caused health problems. The ACMD said there was \\"no evidence\\" khat was directly linked with serious or organised crime, and was chewed to obtain a \\"mild stimulant effect much less potent than stimulant drugs, such as amphetamine\\". On 3 July 2013, the British Home Secretary Theresa May announced that khat was to be banned in Britain, designating it a Class C substance under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. Alex Miller, a journalist from the Montreal, Canada-based magazine and television channel Vice, looked into the use of the substance and the potential impact of the ban for BBC nightly current affairs programme Newsnight and for a Vice documentary. Kenyan MPs appealed to the UK not to \\"condemn people\\" by banning the herbal stimulant khat In March 2014, the United Kingdom House of Commons' Home Affairs Select Committee announced that it would continue to lobby for the UK government not to go through with its intended ban on khat. The committee had shortly before also completed an inquiry and a report recommending that the British authorities refrain from banning the plant. On 12 May 2014, the House of Lords passed a Motion to Approve the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Designation)(Amendment) (No. 2)(England, Wales and Scotland) Order 2014, in order to control Catha edulis as a Class C drug. An amendment was proposed stating that, \\"this House regrets that Her Majesty‚Äôs Government‚Äôs plans for the introduction of the Order do not include provisions for a 12-month review of the impact of the reclassification of khat in view of the highly unusual community focus of its use, for putting a detailed policing strategy in place before a ban takes effect, or for a health strategy to prevent a transfer of addiction to other substances; and do not commit the Department for International Development to do more work with the government of Kenya to alleviate the effect of the reclassification on the Kenyan economy.\\" However, the amendment was defeated by vote. The prohibition came into effect on 24 June 2014. In January 2015, the Bristol Post reported that most khat houses in the city had closed down, \\"forcing users to take the drug in their homes instead\\". The local police had initially not sought to enforce the ban, giving users a grace period, but according to the Bristol Post had recently started to take action against khat use and had issued three warnings and a caution. Additionally, in September 2014 the police had seized 24 bags of dried khat from a property in Easton, but no arrests were made. Additionally, the Somali Resource Centre indicated that the ban seemed to have been effective, and that the prohibition had all but destroyed the import market since the plant has to be fresh in order to be consumed. A consultation with Somalis in Glasgow undertaken by the national voluntary organisation Fast Forward at the request of the Somali Association in Glasgow in October 2014 suggested that khat continues to be used in both fresh and dried forms by some Somalis in the city, and that the ban has also led some users to seek out other substances. The ban has reportedly served to increase the price of khat in the UK. Channel 4 News reported in September 2014 that prior to the ban, 20 tonnes of khat arrived at Heathrow Airport daily, and it would sell for ¬£3 per bundle. After the ban, it was reportedly selling at ¬£30 per bundle. North America =Canada= In Canada, khat is a controlled substance under Schedule IV of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA), meaning it is illegal to seek or obtain unless approved by a medical practitioner. Possession of khat for personal use is not an indictable offense in Canada. The maximum punishment for trafficking or possession with the intent of trafficking is ten years in prison. In 2008, Canadian authorities reported that khat is the most common illegal drug being smuggled at airports. However, in 2012 the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld a 2011 absolute discharge of a young woman who brought 34 kilograms of khat into Canada in 2009. According to the defence, the ruling recognises that there is no empirical evidence that khat is harmful. The courts in Quebec and Ontario continued to discharge the accused for bringing khat into Canada for the same reason (no evidence of harmfulness of khat) in 2014 and 2016. =United States= In the United States, cathinone is a Schedule I drug, according to the US Controlled Substance Act. The 1993 DEA rule placing cathinone in Schedule I noted that it was effectively also banning khat: Catha edulis (khat) is a stimulant similar to that of amphetamine and its congeners, not a drug as categorised by US FDA (United States Food & Drug Administration) and FDA import Alert #66-23 (published date 03/18/2011) states that \\"Districts may detain, without physical examination, all entries of khat\\", based on section 801(a) (3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act on the grounds that \\"its labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use.\\" As federal and local khat raids have often targeted immigrants from countries where khat is legal, issues of cultural misunderstanding have sometimes been raised.Verhovek, Sam Howe (2006). DEA's Khat Sting Stirs Up Somali \\"Cultural Clash\\". Los Angeles Times. 22 August 2006. The plant itself is specifically banned in Missouri: In California, both the plant itself as well as cathinone, its active component, are illegal. Oceania =Australia= In Australia, the importation of khat is controlled under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956. It is illegal to import khat into Australia for personal use. Khat can only be imported for medical or scientific use. Reuglation 5 and Schedule 4. Importing khat without a permit is subject to fines or prosecution. In 2003, the total number of khat annual permits was 294 and the total number of individual khat permits was 202 however as of 1 December 2013, permits for the use of khat by individuals for recreational/cultural purposes are no longer issued. There are currently no plans by the Australian Government to amend the regulations to allow the importation of khat for personal use. Khat is listed as a Schedule 2 dangerous drug in Queensland, in the same category as cannabis. Schedule 2. Legality in New South Wales is not clear. The importation of Khat (Catha edulis) material (includes material that is fresh, dried, powdered, capsules or tablets) is prohibited under the Customs (Prohibited Import) Regulations 1956 unless the person importing the material is the holder of both a license to import and a permit to import granted by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). Biosecurity Act 2015 =New Zealand= In New Zealand, khat is listed as a Class C drug, in the same category as cannabis and codeine. South America In South America, there is no legislation regarding khat; the active ingredients in the plant can be found in several weight control compounds sold in the continent. Research programs In 2009, the University of Minnesota launched the Khat Research Program (KRP), a multidisciplinary research and training program focusing on the neurobehavioral and health effects of khat, led by Prof. Dr. Mustafa al'Absi. The program was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute for Drug Abuse of the United States. The inaugural event for the KRP was held in Sharm El-Sheik, Egypt, in December, 2009 in collaboration with the International Brain Research Organization (IBRO) and its local affiliates.

Sometimes referred to as \\"Death Magic\\", the term may also sometimes be used in a more general sense to refer to black magic or witchcraft. The word necromancy is adapted from Late Latin necromantia, itself borrowed from post-Classical Greek ŒΩŒµŒ∫œÅŒøŒºŒ±ŒΩœÑŒµŒØŒ± (nekromante√≠a), a compound of Ancient Greek ŒΩŒµŒ∫œÅœåœÇ (nekr√≥s), \\"dead body\\", and ŒºŒ±ŒΩœÑŒµŒØŒ± (mante√≠a), \\"divination by means of\\"; this compound form was first used by Origen of Alexandria in the 3rd century AD. The Classical Greek term was ·º° ŒΩŒ≠Œ∫œÖŒπŒ± (nekyia), from the episode of the Odyssey in which Odysseus visits the realm of the dead souls and ŒΩŒµŒ∫œÅŒøŒºŒ±ŒΩœÑŒµŒØŒ± in Hellenistic Greek, rendered as necromantƒ´a in Latin, and as necromancy in 17th-century English.necyomancy, n., OED.  Antiquity  Early necromancy was related to ‚Äì and most likely evolved from ‚Äì shamanism, which calls upon spirits such as the ghosts of ancestors. Classical necromancers addressed the dead in \\"a mixture of high-pitch squeaking and low droning\\", comparable to the trance-state mutterings of shamans.Luck, p. 12. Necromancy was prevalent throughout Western antiquity with records of its practice in ancient Egypt, Babylonia, Greece and Rome. In his Geographica, Strabo refers to (nekromantia), or \\"diviners by the dead\\", as the foremost practitioners of divination among the people of Persia,Strabo. Geography, Book XVI, Chapter 2, Section 39. and it is believed to have also been widespread among the peoples of Chaldea (particularly the Sabians, or \\"star-worshipers\\"), Etruria and Babylonia. The Babylonian necromancers were called manzazuu or sha'etemmu, and the spirits they raised were called etemmu. The oldest literary account of necromancy is found in Homer's Odyssey.Johnson, p. 808.Ruickbie, p. 24. Under the direction of Circe, a powerful sorceress, Odysseus travels to the underworld (katabasis) in order to gain insight about his impending voyage home by raising the spirits of the dead through the use of spells which Circe has taught him. He wishes to invoke and question the shade of Tiresias in particular; however, he is unable to summon the seer's spirit without the assistance of others. The Odysseys passages contain many descriptive references to necromantic rituals: rites must be performed around a pit with fire during nocturnal hours, and Odysseus has to follow a specific recipe, which includes the blood of sacrificial animals, to concoct a libation for the ghosts to drink while he recites prayers to both the ghosts and gods of the underworld.Homer. Odyssey, Book X, Lines 10‚Äì11, and Book XI. Practices such as these, varying from the mundane to the grotesque, were commonly associated with necromancy. Rituals could be quite elaborate, involving magic circles, wands, talismans, and incantations. The necromancer might also surround himself with morbid aspects of death, which often included wearing the deceased's clothing and consuming foods that symbolized lifelessness and decay such as unleavened black bread and unfermented grape juice. Some necromancers even went so far as to take part in the mutilation and consumption of corpses.Guiley, p. 215. These ceremonies could carry on for hours, days, or even weeks, leading up to the eventual summoning of spirits. Frequently they were performed in places of interment or other melancholy venues that suited specific guidelines of the necromancer. Additionally, necromancers preferred to summon the recently departed based on the premise that their revelations were spoken more clearly. This timeframe was usually limited to the twelve months following the death of the physical body; once this period elapsed, necromancers would evoke the deceased's ghostly spirit instead.Lewis, p. 201. While some cultures considered the knowledge of the dead to be unlimited, ancient Greeks and Romans believed that individual shades knew only certain things. The apparent value of their counsel may have been based on things they knew in life or knowledge they acquired after death. Ovid writes in his Metamorphoses of a marketplace in the underworld where the dead convene to exchange news and gossip.Luck, p. 13.Ovid. Metamorphoses, Book IV, Fable VII, Lines 440‚Äì464. In the Mabinogion, a collection of traditional Welsh oral stories that originate from the 7th and 8th centuries, which was ultimately recorded onto manuscripts between 1350‚Äì1410, records Bran gifting Matholwch with new horses and gifts, including a magical cauldron Pair Dadeni that brings the dead back to life.https://www.historic- uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofWales/The-Mabinogion/ There are also several references to necromancers ‚Äì called \\"bone-conjurers\\" among Jews of the later Hellenistic periodLuck, p. 57. ‚Äì in the Bible. The Book of Deuteronomy (18:9‚Äì12cf. Tanakh, Torah, Devarim 18:9‚Äì12.) explicitly warns the Israelites against engaging in the Canaanite practice of divination from the dead: Though Mosaic Law prescribed the death penalty to practitioners of necromancy (Leviticus 20:27cf. Tanakh, Torah, Vayikra 20:27.), this warning was not always heeded. One of the foremost examples is when King Saul had the Witch of Endor invoke the spirit of Samuel, a judge and prophet, from Sheol using a ritual conjuring pit (1 Samuel 28:3‚Äì25cf. Tanakh, Nevi'im, Shmu'el Aleph 28:3‚Äì25.). However, the so-called witch was shocked at the presence of the real spirit of Samuel for in I Sam 28:12 it says, \\"when the woman saw Samuel, she cried out in a loud voice.\\" Samuel questioned his reawakening asking, \\"Why hast thou disquieted me?\\" Saul did not receive a death penalty (his being the highest authority in the land) but he did receive it from God himself as prophesied by Samuel during that conjuration - within a day he died in battle along with his son Jonathan. Some Christian writers later rejected the idea that humans could bring back the spirits of the dead and interpreted such shades as disguised demons instead, thus conflating necromancy with demon summoning. Caesarius of Arles entreats his audience to put no stock in any demons or gods other than the Christian God, even if the working of spells appears to provide benefit. He states that demons only act with divine permission and are permitted by God to test Christian people. Caesarius does not condemn man here; he only states that the art of necromancy exists, although it is prohibited by the Bible.Kors & Peters, p. 48. On the other hand, some Christians believe that necromancy is real (along with other facets of the occult \\"magic\\") but God has not suffered Christians to deal with those spirits (Deuteronomy 18:14). Still others believe the phantom of Samuel to be a trick, like the hoax s√©ances conducted by many early 20th century illusionist spiritualists, which fooled those recording the events of Samuel's life.  Early and High Middle Age  Many medieval writers believed that actual resurrection required the assistance of God. They saw the practice of necromancy as conjuring demons who took the appearance of spirits. The practice became known explicitly as maleficium, and the Catholic Church condemned it.Kieckhefer 2011, p. 152. Though the practitioners of necromancy were linked by many common threads, there is no evidence that these necromancers ever organized as a group. One noted commonality among practitioners of necromancy was usually the utilization of certain toxic and hallucinogenic plants from the nightshade family such as black henbane, jimson weed, belladonna or mandrake, usually in magic salves or potions. Medieval necromancy is believed to be a synthesis of astral magic derived from Arabic influences and exorcism derived from Christian and Jewish teachings. Arabic influences are evident in rituals that involve moon phases, sun placement, day and time. Fumigation and the act of burying images are also found in both astral magic and necromancy. Christian and Jewish influences appear in the symbols and in the conjuration formulas used in summoning rituals.Kieckhefer 2011, pp. 165‚Äì166. Practitioners were often members of the Christian clergy, though some nonclerical practitioners are recorded. In some instances, mere apprentices or those ordained to lower orders dabbled in the practice. They were connected by a belief in the manipulation of spiritual beings ‚Äì especially demons ‚Äì and magical practices. These practitioners were almost always literate and well educated. Most possessed basic knowledge of exorcism and had access to texts of astrology and of demonology. Clerical training was informal and university-based education rare. Most were trained under apprenticeships and were expected to have a basic knowledge of Latin, ritual and doctrine. This education was not always linked to spiritual guidance and seminaries were almost non-existent. This situation allowed some aspiring clerics to combine Christian rites with occult practices despite its condemnation in Christian doctrine.Kieckhefer 2011, pp. 153‚Äì154. Medieval practitioners believed they could accomplish three things with necromancy: will manipulation, illusions, and knowledge: * Will manipulation affects the mind and will of another person, animal, or spirit. Demons are summoned to cause various afflictions on others, \\"to drive them mad, to inflame them to love or hatred, to gain their favor, or to constrain them to do or not do some deed.\\"Kieckhefer 2011, p. 158. * Illusions involve reanimation of the dead or conjuring food, entertainment, or a mode of transportation. * Knowledge is allegedly discovered when demons provide information about various things. This might involve identifying criminals, finding items, or revealing future events. The act of performing medieval necromancy usually involved magic circles, conjurations, and sacrifices such as those shown in the Munich Manual of Demonic Magic: * Circles were usually traced on the ground, though cloth and parchment were sometimes used. Various objects, shapes, symbols, and letters may be drawn or placed within that represent a mixture of Christian and occult ideas. Circles were believed to empower and protect what was contained within, including protecting the necromancer from the conjured demons. * Conjuration is the method of communicating with the demons to have them enter the physical world. It usually employs the power of special words and stances to call out the demons and often incorporated the use of Christian prayers or biblical verses. These conjurations may be repeated in succession or repeated to different directions until the summoning is complete. * Sacrifice was the payment for summoning; though it may involve the flesh of a human being or animal, it could sometimes be as simple as offering a certain object. Instructions for obtaining these items were usually specific. The time, location, and method of gathering items for sacrifice could also play an important role in the ritual.Kieckhefer 2011, pp. 159‚Äì162. The rare confessions of those accused of necromancy suggest that there was a range of spell casting and related magical experimentation. It is difficult to determine if these details were due to their practices, as opposed to the whims of their interrogators. John of Salisbury is one of the first examples related by Richard Kieckhefer, but as a Parisian ecclesiastical court record of 1323 shows, a \\"group who were plotting to invoke the demon Berich from inside a circle made from strips of cat skin\\" were obviously participating in what the Church would define as \\"necromancy\\".Kieckhefer 1998, p. 191. Herbert Stanley Redgrove claims necromancy as one of three chief branches of medieval ceremonial magic, alongside black magic and white magic.Redgrove, p. 95. This does not correspond to contemporary classifications, which often conflate \\"nigromancy\\" (\\"black-knowledge\\") with \\"necromancy\\" (\\"death-knowledge\\").  Late Middle Ages to Renaissance  Engraving of occultists John Dee and Edward Kelley \\"in the act of invoking the spirit of a deceased person\\"; from Astrology (1806) by Ebenezer Sibly. In the wake of inconsistencies of judgment, necromancers and other practitioners of the magic arts were able to utilize spells featuring holy names with impunity, as any biblical references in such rituals could be construed as prayers rather than spells. As a consequence, the necromancy that appears in the Munich Manual is an evolution of these theoretical understandings. It has been suggested that the authors of the Manual knowingly designed the book to be in discord with ecclesiastical law. The main recipe employed throughout the Manual used the same religious language and names of power alongside demonic names. An understanding of the names of God derived from apocryphal texts and the Hebrew Torah required that the author of such rites have at least a casual familiarity with these sources. Within the tales related in occult manuals are found connections with stories from other cultures' literary traditions. For instance, the ceremony for conjuring a horse closely relates to the Arabic One Thousand and One Nights and French romances; Chaucer's The Squire's Tale also bears marked similarities.Kieckhefer 1998, p. 43. This becomes a parallel evolution of spells to foreign gods or demons that were once acceptable, and frames them into a new Christian context, albeit demonic and forbidden. As the material for these manuals was apparently derived from scholarly magical and religious texts from a variety of sources in many languages, the scholars who studied these texts likely manufactured their own aggregate sourcebook and manual with which to work spells or magic. In the notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, it is stated that \\"Of all human opinions that is to be reputed the most foolish which deals with the belief in Necromancy, the sister of Alchemy, which gives birth to simple and natural things.\\"Leonardo. Notebooks, Volume 2, Chapter XIX, Section III:1213.  Modern era  In the present day, necromancy is more generally used as a term to describe manipulation of death and the dead, or the pretense thereof, often facilitated through the use of ritual magic or some other kind of occult ceremony. Contemporary s√©ances, channeling and Spiritualism verge on necromancy when supposedly invoked spirits are asked to reveal future events or secret information. Necromancy may also be presented as sciomancy, a branch of theurgic magic. Because of their themes of spirit contact, the long-running show Supernatural Chicago and the annual Harry Houdini s√©ance, both of which are held at the Excalibur nightclub in Chicago, Illinois, dub their lead performer \\"Neil Tobin, Necromancer\\". As to the practice of necromancy having endured in one form or another throughout the millennia, An Encyclop√¶dia of Occultism states: In popular culture Necromancy appears in many works of fantasy fiction, often by villains who use it to raise armies of zombies that the heroes must slay. * Necromancy is a popular plot element in computer and video games, such as Diablo 2, Diablo 3, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Shadow of Mordor, Shadow of War, The Elder Scrolls Online, World of Warcraft, Magic the Gathering, Gothic and Mortal Kombat, as well as in the tabletop role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons. * In the film Army of Darkness (1992) the protagonist Ash fights a skeletal army raised by the Necronomicon. * Warhammer 40,000, The Mummy Returns, Yu-Gi-Oh! GX and Man of Steel feature antagonists who are trying to revive their own people that have been dead for a long time, specifically Necrons, Anubis, Camula and General Zod, respectively. * Necromancer is the main protagonist of Tony Vilgotsky's novel Shepherd of the Dead.Valentina Vartsaba. Good Mage Versus the Forces of Evil * Necromancer was the title of a song on the Al Stewart 1993 album Famous Last Words (Al Stewart album); the name comes from the song's lyric, \\"oh, the necromancer inside us all!\\", with further lyrics referencing commonly associated themes of black magic and the supernatural. * Necromancer was the title of a song on the Van der Graaf Generator 1969 album The Aerosol Grey Machine, in which the lyrics describe an unnamed, benevolent necromancer. * Necromancy Cottage, or, the Black Art of Gnawing on Bones, a literary fantasy novel written by Rebecca McNutt during her studies of law and occult traditions at Dalhousie University, followed a necromancer and his unwilling apprentice, who are made to question the intent of their magic when an outsider visits their secluded island. The book doubled as a political allegory, in which one sorcerer's necromancy is compared to radical socialism, and his apprentice's necromancy to a conservative libertarian ideology. * Firestarter (novel) by horror author Stephen King featured Necromancer as the name of a horse that main character Charlie McGee enjoys riding during her time spent trapped at a secret government agency. In the 1984 adaptation of Firestarter (film), antagonist John Rainbird explains to Charlie that a necromancer is \\"some kind of a wizard\\". * In the band Sundara Karma's second album ‚ÄúUfilitas‚Äô Alphabet‚Äù there is a song entitled ‚ÄúDuller Days‚Äù which includes the line ‚ÄúA Necromance as common as the flu‚Äù. * The 2018 fiction book \\"A Necromancer's Cult\\", by Michelle Moffat, describes the personal sacrifices involved in a ritual to bring a woman back from the dead. * In the 2018 horror comedy anime Zombie Land Saga, idol producer and supporting character named Kotaro Tatsumi (who happens to be a necromancer) resurrected six \\"legendary\\" girls, including the main protagonist Sakura Minamoto, to form an all-zombie idol group known as \\"Franchouchou\\" in order to help revitalize Saga Prefecture. * In Sheri S. Tepper's True Game series, necromancy is one of the primary Talents that may be possessed by Gamesmen. * In the A Certain Magical Index spinoff manga A Certain Scientific Accelerator, the character Esther Rosenthal belongs to a line of necromancers, in which she is the current head. * In the MMORPG Wizard101 the term necromancer is used for a character that practices death school magic. * In Ridley Scott's Raised by Wolves series, the underlying type of android for a certain character in the show. * The Sorceress from the 2013 fantasy beat-em-up Dragon's Crown is a necromancer who can reanimate skeletons found in dungeons to fight as her ally.

Mechanism Their target, aldose reductase, is an enzyme that is normally present in many other parts of the body, and catalyzes one of the steps in the sorbitol(polyol) pathway that is responsible for fructose formation from glucose. Aldose reductase activity increases as the glucose concentration rises in diabetes in those tissues that are not insulin sensitive, which include the lenses, peripheral nerves and glomerulus. Sorbitol does not diffuse through cell membranes easily and therefore accumulates, causing osmotic damage which leads to retinopathy and neuropathy. Examples File:Alrestatin.svgAlrestatin File:Epalrestat.svgEpalrestat File:Fidarestat structure.svgFidarestat File:Imirestat.svgImirestat File:Lidorestat.svgLidorestat File:Minalrestat.svgMinalrestat File:Ponalrestat.svgPonalrestat File:Ranirestat.svgRanirestat File:Salfredin B11.svgSalfredin B11 File:Sorbinil.svgSorbinil File:Tolrestat structure.svgTolrestat File:Zenarestat structure.svgZenarestat File:Zopolrestat.svgZopolrestat Natural sources reported to inhibit aldose reductase include indian gooseberry, spinach, cumin seeds, fennel seeds, basil leaves, lemon, black pepper, orange, curry leaves, cannabis, cinnamon and lichen. Luteolin, a type of flavonoid found mostly in leaves, and their synthetic derivatives are potential inhibitors of aldose reductase. Diabetic cataract Diabetic cataract formation follows an increase in sugars in the lens. The excess sugar within the lens is reduced by aldose reductase to its alcohol, but the lens capsule is relatively impermeable to sugar alcohols. Because of the excess sugar alcohol (polyol), the lens imbibes water, causing osmotic imbalance. Eventually, increased sodium and decreased potassium levels and decreased glutathione levels lead to cataract formation. Topical administration of aldose reductase inhibitors have been shown to prevent the cataract in rats. Asthma and COPD This class of drugs is also under investigation as a possible root pathology modulating treatment for asthma and COPD since it has been shown that they inhibit goblet cell metaplasia in the respiratory epithelium, thereby reducing the copious mucous secretion associated with these.

It can be characterized either as the intersection of all linear subspaces that contain , or as the set of linear combinations of elements of . The linear span of a set of vectors is therefore a vector space. Spans can be generalized to matroids and modules. For expressing that a vector space is a span of a set , one commonly uses the following phrases: spans ; generates ; is spanned by ; is generated by ; is a spanning set of ; is a generating set of . Definition Given a vector space V over a field K, the span of a set S of vectors (not necessarily infinite) is defined to be the intersection W of all subspaces of V that contain S. W is referred to as the subspace spanned by S, or by the vectors in S. Conversely, S is called a spanning set of W, and we say that S spans W. Alternatively, the span of S may be defined as the set of all finite linear combinations of elements (vectors) of S, which follows from the above definition. :\\\\operatorname{span}(S) = \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ {\\\\left.\\\\sum_{i=1}^k \\\\lambda_i v_i \\\\right k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}, v_i \\\\in S, \\\\lambda _i \\\\in K} \\\\right \\\\\\\\}. In particular, if S is a finite subset of V, then the span of S is the set of all linear combinations of the elements of S. In the case of infinite S, infinite linear combinations (i.e. where a combination may involve an infinite sum, assuming that such sums are defined somehow as in, say, a Banach space) are excluded by the definition; a generalization that allows these is not equivalent.  Examples  The cross-hatched plane is the linear span of u and v in R3. The real vector space R3 has {(‚àí1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)} as a spanning set. This particular spanning set is also a basis. If (‚àí1, 0, 0) were replaced by (1, 0, 0), it would also form the canonical basis of R3. Another spanning set for the same space is given by {(1, 2, 3), (0, 1, 2), (‚àí1, , 3), (1, 1, 1)}, but this set is not a basis, because it is linearly dependent. The set {(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (1, 1, 0)} is not a spanning set of R3, since its span is the space of all vectors in R3 whose last component is zero. That space is also spanned by the set {(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0)}, as (1, 1, 0) is a linear combination of (1, 0, 0) and (0, 1, 0). It does, however, span R2.(when interpreted as a subset of R3). The empty set is a spanning set of {(0, 0, 0)}, since the empty set is a subset of all possible vector spaces in R3, and {(0, 0, 0)} is the intersection of all of these vector spaces. The set of functions xn where n is a non-negative integer spans the space of polynomials. Theorems Theorem 1: The subspace spanned by a non-empty subset S of a vector space V is the set of all linear combinations of vectors in S. This theorem is so well known that at times, it is referred to as the definition of span of a set. Theorem 2: Every spanning set S of a vector space V must contain at least as many elements as any linearly independent set of vectors from V. Theorem 3: Let V be a finite-dimensional vector space. Any set of vectors that spans V can be reduced to a basis for V, by discarding vectors if necessary (i.e. if there are linearly dependent vectors in the set). If the axiom of choice holds, this is true without the assumption that V has finite dimension. This also indicates that a basis is a minimal spanning set when V is finite-dimensional.  Generalizations  Generalizing the definition of the span of points in space, a subset X of the ground set of a matroid is called a spanning set, if the rank of X equals the rank of the entire ground set. The vector space definition can also be generalized to modules. Given an R-module A and a collection of elements a1, ‚Ä¶, an of A, the submodule of A spanned by a1, ‚Ä¶, an is the sum of cyclic modules :Ra_1 + \\\\cdots + Ra_n = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\sum_{k=1}^n r_k a_k \\\\Big r_k \\\\in R \\\\right\\\\\\\\} consisting of all R-linear combinations of the elements ai. As with the case of vector spaces, the submodule of A spanned by any subset of A is the intersection of all submodules containing that subset. Closed linear span (functional analysis) In functional analysis, a closed linear span of a set of vectors is the minimal closed set which contains the linear span of that set. Suppose that X is a normed vector space and let E be any non-empty subset of X. The closed linear span of E, denoted by \\\\overline{\\\\operatorname{Sp}}(E) or \\\\overline{\\\\operatorname{Span}}(E), is the intersection of all the closed linear subspaces of X which contain E. One mathematical formulation of this is :\\\\overline{\\\\operatorname{Sp}}(E) = \\\\\\\\{u\\\\in X  \\\\forall\\\\epsilon > 0\\\\,\\\\exists x\\\\in\\\\operatorname{Sp}(E) : \\\\x - u\\\\<\\\\epsilon\\\\\\\\}. The closed linear span of the set of functions xn on the interval [0, 1], where n is a non-negative integer, depends on the norm used. If the L2 norm is used, then the closed linear span is the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions on the interval. But if the maximum norm is used, the closed linear span will be the space of continuous functions on the interval. In either case, the closed linear span contains functions that are not polynomials, and so are not in the linear span itself. However, the cardinality of the set of functions in the closed linear span is the cardinality of the continuum, which is the same cardinality as for the set of polynomials. Notes The linear span of a set is dense in the closed linear span. Moreover, as stated in the lemma below, the closed linear span is indeed the closure of the linear span. Closed linear spans are important when dealing with closed linear subspaces (which are themselves highly important, see Riesz's lemma). A useful lemma Let X be a normed space and let E be any non-empty subset of X. Then (E) is a closed linear subspace of X which contains E,  \\\\overline{\\\\operatorname{Sp}}(E) = \\\\overline{\\\\operatorname{Sp}(E)}, viz. \\\\overline{\\\\operatorname{Sp}}(E) is the closure of \\\\operatorname{Sp}(E),  E^\\\\perp = (\\\\operatorname{Sp}(E))^\\\\perp = \\\\left(\\\\overline{\\\\operatorname{Sp}(E)}\\\\right)^\\\\perp. }} (So the usual way to find the closed linear span is to find the linear span first, and then the closure of that linear span.)

As a royal clerk to the king and two archbishops, he travelled widely and wrote extensively. He studied and taught in France and visited Rome several times, meeting the Pope. He was nominated for several bishoprics but turned them down in the hope of becoming Bishop of St Davids, but was unsuccessful despite considerable support. His final post was as Archdeacon of Brecon, from which he retired to academic study for the remainder of his life. Much of his writing survives. Life Early life Manorbier Castle, birthplace of Gerald of Wales Born at Manorbier Castle in Pembrokeshire, Wales, Gerald was of mixed Norman and Welsh descent. Gerald was the youngest son of William FitzOdo de Barry or Barri, the common ancestor of the De Barry family of Ireland, a retainer of Arnulf de Montgomery and Gerald de Windsor, and one of the most powerful Anglo-Norman barons in Wales. MacCaffrey, James. \\"Giraldus Cambrensis.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 20 Jul. 2015 His mother was Angharad FitzGerald, a daughter of Gerald FitzWalter of Windsor, Constable of Pembroke Castle, and his wife Nest ferch Rhys, daughter of Rhys ap Tewdwr, the last King of South Wales. Through his mother Angharad, Gerald was a nephew of David fitzGerald, Bishop of St Davids, as well as a great-nephew of Gruffydd ap Rhys, the son and heir of Rhys ap Tewdwr, and a cousin of Rhys ap Gruffydd, the famous Arglwydd Rhys and his family. Gerald received his initial education at the Benedictine house of Gloucester, followed by a period of study in Paris from ‚Äì74, where he studied the trivium. He was employed by Richard of Dover, the Archbishop of Canterbury, on various ecclesiastical missions in Wales, wherein he distinguished himself for his efforts to remove supposed abuses of consanguinity and tax laws flourishing in the Welsh church at the time. He was appointed in 1174 as Archdeacon of Brecon, to which was attached a residence at Llanddew. He obtained this position by reporting the existence of the previous archdeacon's mistress; the man was promptly sacked. While administrating this post, Gerald collected tithes of wool and cheese from the populace; the income from the archdeaconry supported him for many years. Upon the death of his uncle, the Bishop of St Davids, in 1176, the chapter nominated Gerald as his successor. St Davids had the long-term aim of becoming independent of Canterbury, and the chapter may have thought that Gerald was the man to take up its cause. King Henry II of England, fresh from his struggle with Archbishop Thomas Becket, promptly rejected Gerald, possibly because his Welsh blood and ties to the ruling family of Deheubarth made him seem like a troublesome prospect, in favour of one of his Norman retainers, Peter de Leia. According to Gerald, the king said at the time: \\"It is neither necessary or expedient for king or archbishop that a man of great honesty or vigour should become Bishop of St. Davids, for fear that the Crown and Canterbury should suffer thereby. Such an appointment would only give strength to the Welsh and increase their pride\\". The chapter acquiesced in the decision; and Gerald, disappointed with the result, withdrew to the University of Paris. From -8, he studied and taught canon law and theology. He returned to England and spent an additional five years studying theology. In 1180, he received a minor appointment from the Bishop of St. Davids, which he soon resigned. Travels Gerald became a royal clerk and chaplain to King Henry II of England in 1184, first acting mediator between the crown and Prince Rhys ap Gruffydd. He was chosen to accompany one of the king's sons, John, in 1185 on John's first expedition to Ireland. This was the catalyst for his literary career; his work Topographia Hibernica (first circulated in manuscript in 1188, and revised at least four more times) is an account of his journey to Ireland; Gerald always referred to it as his Topography, though \\"History\\" is the more accurate term.O'Meara 14. He followed it up, shortly afterward, with an account of Henry's conquest of Ireland, the Expugnatio Hibernica. Both works were revised and added to several times before his death, and display a notable degree of Latin learning, as well as a great deal of prejudice against a foreign people. Gerald was proud to be related to some of the Norman invaders of Ireland, such as his maternal uncle Robert FitzStephen and Raymond FitzGerald, and his influential account, which portrays the Irish as barbaric savages, gives important insight into Anglo-Norman views of Ireland and the history of the invasion. Having thus demonstrated his usefulness, Gerald was selected to accompany the Archbishop of Canterbury, Baldwin of Forde, on a tour of Wales in 1188, the object being a recruitment campaign for the Third Crusade. His account of that journey, the Itinerarium Cambriae (1191) was followed by the Descriptio Cambriae in 1194. His two works on Wales remain very valuable historical documents, useful for their descriptions ‚Äì however untrustworthy and inflected by ideology, whimsy, and his unique style ‚Äì of Welsh and Norman culture. It is uncertain whether Gerald was a Welsh speaker; although he quotes Welsh proverbs and appears familiar with the language, he seems not to have been employed as an interpreter for the expedition. As a royal clerk, Gerald observed significant political events at first hand, and was offered appointments as bishoprics of Wexford and Leighlin, and apparently at a little later time the bishopric of Ossory and the archbishopric of Cashel, and later the Welsh Bishopric of Bangor and, in 1191, that of Llandaff. He turned them all down, possibly in the hopes of landing a more prominent bishopric in the future. He was acquainted with Walter Map, whose career shares some similarities with Gerald's. Retiring from royal service, he lived in Lincoln from to 1198 where his friend William de Montibus was now chancellor of the Cathedral. It was in this period that De principis instructione was probably first written, a useful historical source on contemporary events. It was an influential work at the time, spreading, for example, the legend of MacAlpin's treason. Here Gerald is frequently critical of the rule of the Angevin kings, a shift from his earlier praise of Henry II in the Topographia. He also wrote a life of St Hugh of Lincoln. Attempts to become bishop of St. Davids St Davids Cathedral today On the death of Peter de Leia in 1198, the chapter of St Davids again nominated Gerald for the bishopric; but Hubert Walter, Archbishop of Canterbury, refused confirmation. Representatives of the canons followed Richard I to France, but before they could interview him he died; his successor, King John, received them kindly and granted them permission to hold an election. They were unanimous in their selection of Gerald, and Gerald acted as bishop-elect for much of the next four years; and, as Hubert still refused to confirm the election, Gerald started for Rome to have his election confirmed, where he had an interview with Pope Innocent III. He visited Rome on three occasions (1199‚Äì1200; 1201; 1202‚Äì3) in support of his claims. In 1198 the archbishop, however, had anticipated him and his agents in Rome undermined Gerald's case, and, as the pope was not convinced that St Davids was independent of Canterbury, the mission of Gerald proved a failure. Gerald had pleaded not only his own cause, but that of St Davids as a Metropolitan archbishopric (and thus of the same status as Canterbury) reviving the earlier claims of Rhygyfarch and Bishop Bernard of St Davids. It was in connexion with this cause that he wrote his books \\"De jure Menevensis Ecclesi√¢\\" and \\"De Rebus a Se Gestis\\". Gerald returned, and his cause was now supported by the Princes of Wales, most notably Llywelyn the Great, and Gruffydd ap Rhys II, while King John, frequently in conflict with the Welsh, warmly espoused the cause of the Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1202, Gerald was accused of stirring up the Welsh to rebellion and was put on trial, but the trial came to nothing in consequence of the absence of the principal judges. After this long struggle, the chapter of St Davids deserted Gerald, and having been obliged to leave Wales, he fled to Rome. The ports had been closed against him so he travelled in secret. In April 1203 Pope Innocent III annulled both elections, and Geoffrey of Henlaw was appointed to the See of St Davids, despite the strenuous exertions of Gerald. Travelling back to France, he was briefly imprisoned in France for these actions. He was afterwards reconciled with the king and was forced to make a vow never to support the primacy of St Davids over Canterbury ever again. The expenses of his unsuccessful election were paid by the crown. Gerald maintained that fear of the effect that his appointment would have on the national politics in Wales had prevented his appointment. He famously complained in a letter to Innocent III \\"Because I am a Welshman am I to be debarred from all preferments in Wales? On the same reasoning so would an Englishman in England, a Frenchman in France, and Italian in Italy. But I am sprung from the Princes of Wales and the Barons of the Marches, and when I see injustice in either race I hate it\\".Biography ‚Äì Gerald of Wales At this point he resigned his position as archdeacon of Brecon. Later life Gerald spent the remainder of his life in academic study, most probably in Lincoln, producing works of devotional instruction and politics, and revising the works on Ireland and Wales he had written earlier in his life. He spent two years (1204‚Äì6) in Ireland with his relatives and made a fourth visit to Rome, purely as a pilgrimage, in 1206. The controversy over St Davids soured his relationship with the crown. In 1216 a baronial plan to put Louis VIII of France on the throne of England in the First Barons' War was warmly welcomed by him. He died in about 1223 in his 77th year, probably in Hereford and he is, according to some accounts, buried at St Davids Cathedral.Robert Bartlett, \\"Gerald of Wales (c.1146‚Äì1220x23)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004 There is a statue, by Henry Poole of Gerald in City Hall, Cardiff, and he was included in the vote on 100 Welsh Heroes for his Descriptio Cambriae and Itinerarium Cambriae. His reputation in Ireland, due to his negative portrayal of the Irish, is much less friendly. Works Gerald's writings in good quality Latin, based on a thorough knowledge of Classical authors, reflect experiences gained on his travels as well as his great knowledge of the standard authorities. He was respected as a scholar in his time and afterward. The noted scholar Edward Augustus Freeman, in his Norman Conquest, said he was \\"the father of comparative philology,\\" and in the preface to the last volume of Gerald's works in the Rolls Series, he calls him \\"one of the most learned men of a learned age,\\" \\"the universal scholar.\\"INTRODUCTION \\"The Itinerary of Archbishop Baldwin through Wales\\" His writings were prolific, running to about ten volumes in modern printed editions. Gerald was a man of strong opinions whose works are frequently polemical, including bitter attacks on his enemies, but he also had an intense curiosity, recording much valuable detail of everyday life in his ethnographic works. It is generally agreed today that his most distinguished works are those dealing with Wales and Ireland, with his two books on his beloved Wales the most important: Itinerarium Cambriae and Descriptio Cambriae which tell us much about Welsh history and geography and reflect on the cultural relationship between the Welsh and the English. Gerald, despite his desire for an independent Welsh Church and admiration for parts of Welsh life, was very loyal to Norman Marcher rule, regarding the Normans as more civilised than the Welsh, a feeling reflected in his writings. Professor Davies tells us that Gerald, whom he calls \\"an admirable story- teller\\", is the only source for some of the most famous of the Welsh folk tales including the declaration of the old man of Pencader to Henry II which concludes Descriptio Cambriae: It was Gerald who also wrote (of the Welsh) that \\"If they would be inseparable, they would be insuperable\\", and that, unlike the English hirelings, who fight for power or to procure gain or wealth, the Welsh patriots fight for their country. He had pleasant things to say about the poetic talents of his people, too: Gerald could not have predicted the later perfection of cynghanedd, the complex system of sound correspondence that has characterised the strict-meter poetry of the Welsh for so many centuries and that is still practised today, especially in competitions for the eisteddfod chair. Cynghanedd did not become a formal system with strict rules until the fourteenth century, but its uniquely Welsh forms had been honed for centuries before that. Finally, in Descriptio Cambriae, Gerald penned the following words that give so much pride to Welsh singers of today, especially those who participate in the immensely popular Cymanfaoedd Canu (hymn-singing festivals) held throughout Wales and North America: Another part of the above work,Project Gutenberg Etext of Description of Wales by G. Cambrensis however, is less positive. As Gerald puts it, \\"an attention to order now requires that, in this second part, we should employ our pen in pointing out those particulars in which it seems to transgress the line of virtue and commendation\\". David Powel published an abridged version of Itinerarium Cambriae and Descriptio Cambriae in 1585 omitting Gerald's negative comments about the Welsh. Due to translations into English, the first being done by Sir Richard Colt Hoare, Bart., and other translations such as in Everyman's Library and Penguin Classics, Gerald's works on Wales are well known today. In Gerald's writing on Ireland his love of music is very evident too. Gerald's works on Ireland although invaluable for their detail are obviously biased, and have been attacked by Irish writers such as Stephen White. The following passage from his Topographia Hibernica shows why the Irish might not always be too enamoured with Gerald's views: Gerald was a keen and observant student of natural history, but the value of his observations is lessened by credulity and inability to distinguish fact from legend. He gives a vivid and accurate description of the last colony of the Eurasian beaver in Wales on the Teifi, but spoils it by repeating the legend that beavers castrate themselves to avoid danger.Perry, Richard Wildlife in Britain and Ireland Croom Helm London 1978 pp. 41-43 Likewise he gives a good description of an osprey fishing, but adds the mythical detail that the bird has one webbed foot.Perry p.200 His description of Irish wildlife has been the subject of much adverse comment for its inaccuracies and lapses into fictionD'Arcy, Gordon Ireland's Lost Birds Four Courts Press Dublin 1999 p. 19 but nonetheless, despite its faults, it gives an important glimpse of Irish fauna in the 1180s. Certainly the book has valuable details about Irish birds: while the common kingfisher is now common in Ireland, Gerald states clearly that it was not found there in his time: on the other hand the white-throated dipper, which he had evidently not seen before, was very common in Ireland.Moriarty, Christopher Down the Dodder Wolfhound Press Dublin 1991, pp. 114-5 He also observed the great numbers of birds of prey in Ireland, including the golden eagle and the Eurasian sparrowhawk, which he said were more numerous in Ireland than in England.

He is best known for his chronicle The History of the Kings of Britain ( or ') which was widely popular in its day, being translated into other languages from its original Latin. It was given historical credence well into the 16th century,Polydore Vergil's sceptical reading of Geoffrey of Monmouth provoked a reaction of denial in England, \\"yet the seeds of doubt once sown\\" eventually replaced Geoffrey's romances with a new Renaissance historical approach, according to Hans Baron, \\"Fifteenth- century civilisation and the Renaissance\\", in The New Cambridge Modern history, vol. 1 1957:56. but is now considered historically unreliable. Biography Geoffrey was born between about 1090 and 1100,Crick 2004: \\"it seems likely that he was born within ten years of 1100\\".Foster 1959: \\"Geoffrey was b. between 1090 and 1100\\".Arthurian Figures of history and legend: A biographical dictionary: \\"Geoffrey of Monmouth (floruit 1112‚Äì1139/ lifespan circa 1095‚Äì1155)\\".A Concise History of Wales: \\"The key historical text was Historia Regum Brittanae (c.1139) by Geoffrey of Monmouth (c.1090‚Äì1155)\\". in Wales or the Welsh Marches. He had reached the age of majority by 1129 when he is recorded as witnessing a charter. Geoffrey refers to himself in his Historia as Galfridus Monemutensis (Geoffrey of Monmouth), which indicates a significant connection to Monmouth, Wales, and may refer to his birthplace. His works attest to some acquaintance with the place-names of the region. Geoffrey was known to his contemporaries as Galfridus Arturus or variants thereof.J. C. Crick, \\"Monmouth, Geoffrey of (d. 1154/5)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 7 June 2009 The \\"Arthur\\" in these versions of his name may indicate the name of his father or a nickname based on his scholarly interests. Earlier scholars assumed that Geoffrey was Welsh or at least spoke Welsh. His knowledge of this language appears to have been slight, however, and there is no evidence that he was of either Welsh or Cambro-Norman descent.Roberts, \\"Geoffrey of Monmouth, Historia Regnum Britanniae and Brut y Brenhinedd\\", p. 98. He may have come from the same French-speaking elite of the Welsh border country as Gerald of Wales, Walter Map, and Robert, Earl of Gloucester, to whom Geoffrey dedicated versions of his History. Frank Merry Stenton and others have suggested that Geoffrey's parents may have been among the many Bretons who took part in William I's conquest and settled in the southeast of Wales. Monmouth had been in the hands of Breton lords since 1075 or 1086, and the names Galfridus and Arthur were more common among the Bretons than the Welsh. He may have served for a while in the Benedictine Monmouth Priory, but most of his adult life appears to have been spent outside Wales. Between 1129 and 1151, his name appears on six charters in the Oxford area, sometimes styled magister (teacher). He was probably a secular canon of St. George's college. All the charters signed by Geoffrey are also signed by Walter, Archdeacon of Oxford, a canon at that church. Another frequent co-signatory is Ralph of Monmouth, a canon of Lincoln. Archbishop Theobald of Bec consecrated Geoffrey as Bishop of St Asaph at Lambeth on 24 February 1152, having ordained him a priest at Westminster 10 days before. According to Lewis Thorpe, \\"There is no evidence that he ever visited his see, and indeed the wars of Owain Gwynedd make this most unlikely.\\"From the introduction to his translation of The History of the Kings of Britain (London: Penguin Books, 1966), p. 12. He appears to have died between 25 December 1154 and 24 December 1155 according to Welsh chronicles, when his successor took office. Works Geoffrey's structuring and shaping of the Merlin and Arthur myths engendered their vast popularity which continues today, and he is generally viewed by scholars as the major establisher of the Arthurian canon.Thorpe, Kings of Britain, p. 20ff., particularly pp. 20‚Äì22 & 28‚Äì31. The History's effect on the legend of King Arthur was so vast that Arthurian works have been categorised as \\"pre- Galfridian\\" and \\"post-Galfridian\\", depending on whether or not they were influenced by him.  Historia Regum Britanniae  Geoffrey wrote several works in Latin, the language of learning and literature in Europe during the medieval period. His major work was the Historia Regum Britanniae (The History of the Kings of Britain), the work best known to modern readers. It relates the purported history of Britain, from its first settlement by Brutus of Troy, a descendant of Trojan hero Aeneas, to the death of Cadwaladr in the 7th century, covering Julius Caesar's invasions of Britain, Kings Leir and Cymbeline, and one of the earliest developed narratives of King Arthur. Geoffrey claims in his dedication that the book is a translation of an \\"ancient book in the British language that told in orderly fashion the deeds of all the kings of Britain\\", given to him by Walter, Archdeacon of Oxford, but modern historians have dismissed this claim.Richard M. Loomis, The Romance of Arthur New York & London, Garland Publishing, Inc. 1994, pg. 59 It is likely, however, that the Archdeacon did furnish Geoffrey with some materials in the Welsh language which helped inspire his work, as Geoffrey's position and acquaintance with him would not have permitted him to fabricate such a claim outright.Michael Curley, Geoffrey of Monmouth, p. 12 Much of it is based on the Historia Britonum, a 9th-century Welsh-Latin historical compilation, Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People, and Gildas's 6th-century polemic De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae, expanded with material from bardic oral tradition and genealogical tracts, and embellished by Geoffrey's own imagination.Thorpe, Kings of Britain pp. 14‚Äì19. In an exchange of manuscript material for their own histories, Robert of Torigny gave Henry of Huntingdon a copy of History, which both Robert and Henry used uncritically as authentic history and subsequently used in their own works,C. Warren Hollister, Henry I (Yale English Monarchs), 2001:11 note44. by which means Geoffrey's fictions became embedded in popular history. The History of the Kings of Britain is now usually considered a literary forgery containing little reliable history. This has since led many modern scholars to agree with William of Newburgh, who wrote around 1190 that \\"it is quite clear that everything this man wrote about Arthur and his successors, or indeed about his predecessors from Vortigern onwards, was made up, partly by himself and partly by others.\\"Quoted by Thorpe, Kings of Britain, p. 17. Other contemporaries were similarly unconvinced by Geoffrey's History. For example, Giraldus Cambrensis recounts the experience of a man possessed by demons: \\"If the evil spirits oppressed him too much, the Gospel of St John was placed on his bosom, when, like birds, they immediately vanished; but when the book was removed, and the History of the Britons by 'Geoffrey Arthur' [as Geoffrey named himself] was substituted in its place, they instantly reappeared in greater numbers, and remained a longer time than usual on his body and on the book.\\"Gerald of Wales, The Journey through Wales/The Description of Wales (Lewis Thorpe ed.), Penguin, 1978, Chapter 5, p 116. Geoffrey's major work was nevertheless widely disseminated throughout medieval Western Europe; Acton Griscom listed 186 extant manuscripts in 1929, and others have been identified since.Thorpe, Kings of Britain p. 28 It enjoyed a significant afterlife in a variety of forms, including translations and adaptations such as Wace's Anglo-Norman Roman de Brut, Layamon's Middle English Brut, and several anonymous Middle Welsh versions known as ' (\\"Brut of the Kings\\").Thorpe, Kings of Britain p. 29 where it was generally accepted as a true account. In 2017, Miles Russell published the initial results of the Lost Voices of Celtic Britain Project established at Bournemouth University.Russell, Arthur and the Kings of Britain: The Historical Truth Behind the Myths p. 297-300 The main conclusion of the study was that the Historia Regum Britanniae appears to contain significant demonstrable archaeological fact, despite being compiled many centuries after the period that it describes. Geoffrey seems to have brought together a disparate mass of source material, including folklore, chronicles, king-lists, dynastic tables, oral tales, and bardic praise poems, some of which was irrevocably garbled or corrupted. In doing so, Geoffrey exercised considerable editorial control, massaging the information and smoothing out apparent inconsistencies in order to create a single grand narrative which fed into the preferred narrative of the Norman rulers of Britain. Much of the information that he used can be shown to be derived from two discrete sources: * the orally transmitted, heroic tales of the Catuvellauni and Trinovantes, two essentially pre-Roman tribes inhabiting central south-eastern Britain at the very end of the Iron Age; * the king-lists of important post-Roman dynasties that ruled territories in western Britain. Stretching this source material out, chopping, changing and re-editing it in the process, Geoffrey added not just his own fictions but also additional information culled from later Roman histories and also those of Dark Ages and early medieval writers such as Gildas and Bede. Lost Voices of Celtic Britain Project Other writings Geoffrey's earliest writing was probably the ' (Prophecies of Merlin) which he wrote before 1135, and which appears both independently and incorporated into The History of the Kings of Britain. It consists of a series of obscure prophetic utterances attributed to Merlin which he claimed to have translated from an unspecified language. The third work attributed to Geoffrey is the hexameter poem Vita Merlini (Life of Merlin), based more closely on traditional material about Merlin than the other works. Here he is known as Merlin of the Woods (Merlinus Sylvestris) or Scottish Merlin (Merlinus Caledonius) and is portrayed as an old man living as a crazed and grief- stricken outcast in the forest. The story is set long after the timeframe of the History's Merlin, but the author tries to synchronise the works with references to the mad prophet's previous dealings with Vortigern and Arthur. The Vita did not circulate widely, and the attribution to Geoffrey appears in only one late 13th-century manuscript, but it contains recognisably Galfridian elements in its construction and content, and most critics recognise it as his.

It was incorporated into the city in 1922. It is the seat of the Bishop of Llandaff, whose diocese within the Church in Wales covers the most populous area of Wales. History Llandaff Castle, 1823. Most of the history of Llandaff centres on its role as a religious site. Before the creation of Llandaff Cathedral, it became established as a Christian place of worship in the 6th century AD, probably because of its location as the first firm ground north of the point where the river Taff met the Bristol Channel, and because of its pre-Christian location as a river crossing on a north‚Äìsouth trade route. Evidence of Romano-British ritual burials have been found under the present cathedral. The date of the moving of the cathedral to Llandaff is disputed, but elements of the fabric date from the 12th century, such as the impressive Romanesque Urban Arch, named after the 12th century Bishop, Urban. It has had a history of continual destruction and restoration, as a result of warfare, neglect, and natural disaster. Llandaff has been a focal point of devastating attacks by Owain Glynd≈µr and Oliver Cromwell. It was the second most damaged cathedral in the UK (after Coventry Cathedral), following Luftwaffe bombing during World War II, and subsequently restored by the architect George Pace. One of its main modern points of interest is the aluminium figure of Christ in Majesty (1954‚Äì5), by Jacob Epstein, which is suspended above the nave. In 2007, a lightning strike to its spire sent a surge through the building; which destroyed its organ. Its replacement, the largest to be built in the UK for over 40 years, was inaugurated in 2010. A bishop's palace, now in ruins, lies to the south of the cathedral. It is believed it was constructed at a similar date to Caerphilly Castle, in the late 13th century. It is also believed it was abandoned after being attacked and damaged by Glynd≈µr in the 15th century. The gatehouse of the Palace survives, and the courtyard is now a public garden. Sign entering Llandaff. Llandaff never developed into a chartered borough, and by the 19th century, was described as \\"reduced to a mere village... It consists of little more than two short streets of cottages, not lighted or paved, terminating in a square, into which the great gateway of the old palace formerly opened, and where are still several genteel houses.\\" Speed's map of Llandaff (1610). Historically, Llandaff was informally known as a 'city', because of its status as the seat of the Bishop of Llandaff. This city status was never officially recognised, largely because the community did not possess a charter of incorporation.J V Beckett, City Status in the British Isles, 1830‚Äì2002, Aldershot, 2005 The ancient parish of Llandaff included a wide area. Apart from Llandaff itself, it included the townships of Canton, Ely, Fairwater, and Gabalfa. During the development of the South Wales coalfield and Cardiff Docks, the parish was gradually absorbed into the Borough of Cardiff during the 19th and 20th centuries. Seen as a clean and green up-market countrified village location close to the fast developing city, many of the better-off coal merchants and business people chose to live in Llandaff, including the Insole family. The house now known as Insole Court dates originally from 1856. Llandaff itself became a civil parish, and from 1894 to 1922, was part of the Llandaff and Dinas Powis Rural District. On 9 November 1922, the county borough of Cardiff was extended to include the area. Demography At the United Kingdom Census 2011, the population of the Llandaff was 8,997; of whom 4,309 were male, and 4,688 female. 91.6% were recorded as being of various white ethnicities. Approximately 65% of the population were returned as Christian, with about 1.5% each being Hindu or Muslim, and 30% having no religion or no stated religion. Welsh language In the 2011 census, 15.3% of the population over 3 years old in Llandaff were recorded as speaking Welsh, or 1,337 people. This was a small drop compared to the 2001 census figure, which was 15.4%.Welsh Language Commissioner: 2011 Census: results by community; gwelwyd 24 Ionawr 2015. The headquarters of BBC Cymru Wales is in Llandaff. Research by Owen John Thomas shows the historical strength of the Welsh language in Llandaff. According to his book: 'Yr Iaith Gymraeg yng Nghaerdydd c. 1800‚Äì1914‚Äô (The Welsh language in Cardiff .c1800-1914), the nonconformist church in Cardiff Road was a Welsh-language church in 1813. His work also shows that Welsh was the main language of the street in Llandaff in the 17th century. Governance Llandaff electoral ward of Cardiff Llandaff is both an electoral ward, and a community of the City of Cardiff. There is no community council for the area. The electoral ward of Llandaff is bounded by Radyr & Morganstown to the north west; Llandaff North to the north; Riverside to the west; Canton to the south; and Fairwater to the west. The ward is represented by two councillors on Cardiff Council, Sean Driscoll and Philippa Hill-John, both members of the Conservative Party. In the UK Parliament, Llandaff is part of the constituency of Cardiff West. Its most prominent MPs were former Speaker of the House of Commons; George Thomas, and former First Minister of Wales and Welsh Labour Party leader Rhodri Morgan. The current MP is Labour's Kevin Brennan, elected in 2001. In the Welsh Assembly, Llandaff is part of the constituency of Cardiff West, whose current AM since 2011 is Mark Drakeford of Labour; he succeeded Rhodri Morgan upon the latter's retirement. The constituency falls within the electoral region of South Wales Central, whose four current AMs are Conservatives Andrew R. T. Davies and David Melding; Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood; and UKIP's Gareth Bennett.

It contains approximately 69 species, with the best-known being the Common Mango (Mangifera indica). The center of diversity is in subtropical and tropical South Asia and Southeast Asia, while the highest number of species occur in India. They are generally canopy trees in lowland rainforests, reaching a height of . Uses Mangifera species are widely cultivated in Asia and elsewhere. More than 27 species in the genus bear edible, fleshy fruits, especially the Common Mango (M. indica). Others, such as M. foetida, yield astringent fruits that can be eaten pickled. Fossil record The earliest fossil species thought to be related to Mangifera is Eomangiferophyllum damalgiriense from the upper Paleocene of northeastern India. Leaves have also been reported from the Paleocene of Japan and the Eocene of Germany. Leaf compressions with a close affinity to Mangifera have been collected from Oligocene or early Miocene sediments in northern Thailand.Mehrota, R.C., D.L. Dilcher and N.

He conceived the nuclear chain reaction in 1933, patented the idea of a nuclear fission reactor in 1934, and in late 1939 wrote the letter for Albert Einstein's signature that resulted in the Manhattan Project that built the atomic bomb. According to Gy√∂rgy Marx he was one of the Hungarian scientists known as The Martians. Szilard initially attended Palatine Joseph Technical University in Budapest, but his engineering studies were interrupted by service in the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I. He left Hungary for Germany in 1919, enrolling at Technische Hochschule (Institute of Technology) in Berlin-Charlottenburg, but became bored with engineering and transferred to Friedrich Wilhelm University, where he studied physics. He wrote his doctoral thesis on Maxwell's demon, a long-standing puzzle in the philosophy of thermal and statistical physics. Szilard was the first to recognize the connection between thermodynamics and information theory. In addition to the nuclear reactor, Szilard submitted the earliest patent applications for the electron microscope (1928), the linear accelerator (1928), and the cyclotron (1929) in Germany. Between 1926 and 1930, he worked with Einstein on the development of the Einstein refrigerator. After Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany in 1933, Szilard urged his family and friends to flee Europe while they still could. He moved to England, where he helped found the Academic Assistance Council, an organization dedicated to helping refugee scholars find new jobs. While in England he discovered a means of isotope separation known as the Szilard‚ÄìChalmers effect. Foreseeing another war in Europe, Szilard moved to the United States in 1938, where he worked with Enrico Fermi and Walter Zinn on means of creating a nuclear chain reaction. He was present when this was achieved within the Chicago Pile-1 on December 2, 1942. He worked for the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago on aspects of nuclear reactor design. He drafted the Szilard petition advocating a demonstration of the atomic bomb, but the Interim Committee chose to use them against cities without warning. After the war, Szilard switched to biology. He invented the chemostat, discovered feedback inhibition, and was involved in the first cloning of a human cell. He publicly sounded the alarm against the possible development of salted thermonuclear bombs, a new kind of nuclear weapon that might annihilate mankind. Diagnosed with bladder cancer in 1960, he underwent a cobalt-60 treatment that he had designed. He helped found the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where he became a resident fellow. Szilard founded Council for a Livable World in 1962 to deliver \\"the sweet voice of reason\\" about nuclear weapons to Congress, the White House, and the American public. He died in his sleep of a heart attack in 1964. Early life Born as Le√≥ Spitz in Budapest, Kingdom of Hungary, on February 11, 1898. His middle-class Jewish parents, Louis Spitz, a civil engineer, and Tekla Vidor, raised Le√≥ on the V√°rosligeti Fasor in Pest. He had two younger siblings, a brother, B√©la, born in 1900, and a sister, R√≥zsi, born in 1901. On October 4, 1900, the family changed its surname from the German \\"Spitz\\" to the Hungarian \\"Szil√°rd\\", a name that means \\"solid\\" in Hungarian. Despite having a religious background, Szilard became an agnostic. From 1908 to 1916 he attended Re√°liskola high school in his home town. Showing an early interest in physics and a proficiency in mathematics, in 1916 he won the E√∂tv√∂s Prize, a national prize for mathematics. Leo Szilard aged 18 With World War I raging in Europe, Szilard received notice on January 22, 1916, that he had been drafted into the 5th Fortress Regiment, but he was able to continue his studies. He enrolled as an engineering student at the Palatine Joseph Technical University, which he entered in September 1916. The following year he joined the Austro-Hungarian Army's 4th Mountain Artillery Regiment, but immediately was sent to Budapest as an officer candidate. He rejoined his regiment in May 1918 but in September, before being sent to the front, he fell ill with Spanish Influenza and was returned home for hospitalization. Later he was informed that his regiment had been nearly annihilated in battle, so the illness probably saved his life. He was discharged honorably in November 1918, after the Armistice. In January 1919, Szilard resumed his engineering studies, but Hungary was in a chaotic political situation with the rise of the Hungarian Soviet Republic under B√©la Kun. Szilard and his brother B√©la founded their own political group, the Hungarian Association of Socialist Students, with a platform based on a scheme of Szilard's for taxation reform. He was convinced that socialism was the answer to Hungary's post-war problems, but not that of Kun's Hungarian Socialist Party, which had close ties to the Soviet Union. When Kun's government tottered, the brothers officially changed their religion from \\"Israelite\\" to \\"Calvinist\\", but when they attempted to re-enroll in what was now the Budapest University of Technology, they were prevented from doing so by nationalist students because they were Jews. Convinced that there was no future for him in Hungary, Szilard left for Berlin via Austria on December 25, 1919, and enrolled at the Technische Hochschule (Institute of Technology) in Berlin-Charlottenburg. He was soon joined by his brother B√©la. Szilard became bored with engineering, and his attention turned to physics. This was not taught at the Technische Hochschule, so he transferred to Friedrich Wilhelm University, where he attended lectures given by Albert Einstein, Max Planck, Walter Nernst, James Franck and Max von Laue. He also met fellow Hungarian students Eugene Wigner, John von Neumann and Dennis Gabor. Szilard's doctoral dissertation on thermodynamics √úber die thermodynamischen Schwankungserscheinungen (On The Manifestation of Thermodynamic Fluctuations), praised by Einstein, won top honors in 1922. It involved a long-standing puzzle in the philosophy of thermal and statistical physics known as Maxwell's demon, a thought experiment originated by the physicist James Clerk Maxwell. The problem was thought to be insoluble, but in tackling it Szilard recognized the connection between thermodynamics and information theory. Szilard was appointed as assistant to von Laue at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in 1924. In 1927 he finished his habilitation and became a Privatdozent (private lecturer) in physics. For his habilitation lecture, he produced a second paper on Maxwell's Demon, √úber die Entropieverminderung in einem thermodynamischen System bei Eingriffen intelligenter Wesen (On the reduction of entropy in a thermodynamic system by the intervention of intelligent beings), that had actually been written soon after the first. This introduced the thought experiment now called the Szilard engine and became important in the history of attempts to understand Maxwell's demon. The paper is also the first equation of negative entropy and information. As such, it established Szilard as one of the founders of information theory, but he did not publish it until 1929, and did not pursue it further. Claude E. Shannon, who took it up in the 1950s, acknowledged Szilard's paper as his starting point. Available on-line in English at Aurellen.org. Throughout his time in Berlin, Szilard worked on numerous technical inventions. In 1928 he submitted a patent application for the linear accelerator, not knowing of Gustav Ising's prior 1924 journal article and Rolf Wider√∏e's operational device, and in 1929 applied for one for the cyclotron.He was also the first person to conceive the idea of the electron microscope, and submitted the earliest patent for one in 1928. Between 1926 and 1930, he worked with Einstein to develop the Einstein refrigerator, notable because it had no moving parts. He did not build all of these devices, or publish these ideas in scientific journals, and so credit for them often went to others. As a result, Szilard never received the Nobel Prize, but Ernest Lawrence was awarded it for the cyclotron in 1939, and Ernst Ruska for the electron microscope in 1986. An image from the Fermi‚ÄìSzilard \\"neutronic reactor\\" patent Szilard received German citizenship in 1930, but was already uneasy about the political situation in Europe. When Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany on January 30, 1933, Szilard urged his family and friends to flee Europe while they still could. He moved to England, and transferred his savings of ¬£1,595 (¬£ today) from his bank in Zurich to one in London. He lived in hotels where lodging and meals cost about ¬£5.5 a week. For those less fortunate, he helped found the Academic Assistance Council, an organization dedicated to helping refugee scholars find new jobs, and persuaded the Royal Society to provide accommodation for it at Burlington House. He enlisted the help of academics such as Harald Bohr, G. H. Hardy, Archibald Hill and Frederick G. Donnan. By the outbreak of World War II in 1939, it had helped to find places for over 2,500 refugee scholars. On the morning of September 12, 1933, Szilard read an article in The Times summarizing a speech given by Lord Rutherford in which Rutherford rejected the feasibility of using atomic energy for practical purposes. The speech remarked specifically on the recent 1932 work of his students, John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton, in \\"splitting\\" lithium into alpha particles, by bombardment with protons from a particle accelerator they had constructed. Rutherford went on to say: Szilard was so annoyed at Rutherford's dismissal that, on the same day, he conceived of the idea of nuclear chain reaction (analogous to a chemical chain reaction), using recently discovered neutrons. The idea did not use the mechanism of nuclear fission, which was not yet discovered, but Szilard realized that if neutrons could initiate any sort of energy-producing nuclear reaction, such as the one that had occurred in lithium, and could be produced themselves by the same reaction, energy might be obtained with little input, since the reaction would be self-sustaining. Szilard filed for a patent on the concept of the neutron-induced nuclear chain reaction in 1933, which was granted in 1936. Under section 30 of the Patents and Designs Act (1907, UK), Szilard was able to assign the patent to the British Admiralty to ensure its secrecy, which he did. Consequently, his patent was not published until 1949 when the relevant parts of the Patents and Designs Act (1907, UK) were repealed by the Patents Act (1949, UK). Richard Rhodes described Szilard's moment of inspiration: In early 1934, Szilard began working at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London. Working with a young physicist on the hospital staff, Thomas A. Chalmers, he began studying radioactive isotopes for medical purposes. It was known that bombarding elements with neutrons could produce either heavier isotopes of an element, or a heavier element, a phenomenon known as the Fermi Effect after its discoverer, the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi. When they bombarded ethyl iodide with neutrons produced by a radon‚Äìberyllium source, they found that the heavier radioactive isotopes of iodine separated from the compound. Thus, they had discovered a means of isotope separation. This method became known as the Szilard‚ÄìChalmers effect, and was widely used in the preparation of medical isotopes. He also attempted unsuccessfully to create a nuclear chain reaction using beryllium by bombarding it with X-rays. Manhattan Project Columbia University Szilard visited B√©la and Rose and her husband Roland (Lorand) Detre, in Switzerland in September 1937. After a rainstorm, he and his siblings spent an afternoon in an unsuccessful attempt to build a prototype collapsible umbrella. One reason for the visit was that he had decided to emigrate to the United States, as he believed that another war in Europe was inevitable and imminent. He reached New York on the liner on January 2, 1938. Over the next few months he moved from place to place, conducting research with Maurice Goldhaber at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, and then the University of Chicago, University of Michigan and the University of Rochester, where he undertook experiments with indium but again failed to initiate a chain reaction. Army Intelligence report on Enrico Fermi and Leo Szilard In November 1938, Szilard moved to New York City, taking a room at the King's Crown Hotel near Columbia University. He encountered John R. Dunning, who invited him to speak about his research at an afternoon seminar in January 1939. That month, Niels Bohr brought news to New York of the discovery of nuclear fission in Germany by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, and its theoretical explanation by Lise Meitner, and Otto Frisch. When Szilard found out about it on a visit to Wigner at Princeton University, he immediately realized that uranium might be the element capable of sustaining a chain reaction. Unable to convince Fermi that this was the case, Szilard set out on his own. He obtained permission from the head of the Physics Department at Columbia, George B. Pegram, to use a laboratory for three months. To fund his experiment, he borrowed $2,000 from a fellow inventor, Benjamin Liebowitz. He wired Frederick Lindemann at Oxford and asked him to send a beryllium cylinder. He convinced Walter Zinn to become his collaborator, and hired Semyon Krewer to investigate processes for manufacturing pure uranium and graphite. Szilard and Zinn conducted a simple experiment on the seventh floor of Pupin Hall at Columbia, using a radium‚Äìberyllium source to bombard uranium with neutrons. Initially nothing registered on the oscilloscope, but then Zinn realized that it was not plugged in. On doing so, they discovered significant neutron multiplication in natural uranium, proving that a chain reaction might be possible. Szilard later described the event: \\"We turned the switch and saw the flashes. We watched them for a little while and then we switched everything off and went home.\\" He understood the implications and consequences of this discovery, though. \\"That night, there was very little doubt in my mind that the world was headed for grief\\". While they had demonstrated that the fission of uranium produced more neutrons than it consumed, this was still not a chain reaction. Szilard persuaded Fermi and Herbert L. Anderson to try a larger experiment using of uranium. To maximize the chance of fission, they needed a neutron moderator to slow the neutrons down. Hydrogen was a known moderator, so they used water. The results were disappointing. It became apparent that hydrogen slowed neutrons down, but also absorbed them, leaving fewer for the chain reaction. Szilard then suggested Fermi use carbon, in the form of graphite. He felt he would need about (50.8 metric ton) of graphite and of uranium. As a back-up plan, Szilard also considered where he might find a few tons of heavy water; deuterium would not absorb neutrons like ordinary hydrogen, but would have the similar value as a moderator. Such quantities of material would require a lot of money. Szilard drafted a confidential letter to the President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, explaining the possibility of nuclear weapons, warning of the German nuclear weapon project, and encouraging the development of a program that could result in their creation. With the help of Wigner and Edward Teller, he approached his old friend and collaborator Einstein in August 1939, and convinced him to sign the letter, lending his fame to the proposal. The Einstein‚ÄìSzil√°rd letter resulted in the establishment of research into nuclear fission by the U.S. government, and ultimately to the creation of the Manhattan Project. Roosevelt gave the letter to his aide, Brigadier General Edwin M. \\"Pa\\" Watson with the instruction: \\"Pa, this requires action!\\" An Advisory Committee on Uranium was formed under Lyman J. Briggs, a scientist and the director of the National Bureau of Standards. Its first meeting on October 21, 1939, was attended by Szilard, Teller, and Wigner, who persuaded the Army and Navy to provide $6,000 for Szilard to purchase supplies for experiments‚Äîin particular, more graphite. A 1940 Army intelligence report on Fermi and Szilard, prepared when the United States had not yet entered World War II, expressed reservations about both. While it contained some errors of fact about Szilard, it correctly noted his dire prediction that Germany would win the war. Fermi and Szilard met with representatives of National Carbon Company, who manufactured graphite, and Szilard made another important discovery. He asked about impurities in graphite, and learned that it usually contained boron, a neutron absorber. He then had special boron-free graphite produced. Had he not done so, they might have concluded, as the German nuclear researchers did, that graphite was unsuitable for use as a neutron moderator. Like the German researchers, Fermi and Szilard still believed that enormous quantities of uranium would be required for an atomic bomb, and therefore concentrated on producing a controlled chain reaction. Fermi determined that a fissioning uranium atom produced 1.73 neutrons on average. It was enough, but a careful design was called for to minimize losses. Szilard worked up various designs for a nuclear reactor. \\"If the uranium project could have been run on ideas alone,\\" Wigner later remarked, \\"no one but Leo Szilard would have been needed.\\" Metallurgical Laboratory The Metallurgical Laboratory scientists, with Szilard third from right, in the lab coat. At its December 6, 1941 meeting, the National Defense Research Committee resolved to proceed with an all-out effort to produce atomic bombs. This decision was given urgency by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor the following day that brought the United States into World War II. It was formally approved by Roosevelt in January 1942. Arthur H. Compton from the University of Chicago was appointed head of research and development. Against Szilard's wishes, Compton concentrated all the groups working on reactors and plutonium at the Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago. Compton laid out an ambitious plan to achieve a chain reaction by January 1943, start manufacturing plutonium in nuclear reactors by January 1944, and produce an atomic bomb by January 1945. In January 1942, Szilard joined the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago as a research associate, and later the chief physicist. Alvin Weinberg noted that Szilard served as the project \\"gadfly\\", asking all the embarrassing questions. Szilard provided important insights. While uranium-238 did not fission readily with slow, moderated neutrons, it might still fission with the fast neutrons produced by fission. This effect was small but crucial. Szilard made suggestions that improved the uranium canning process, and worked with David Gurinsky and Ed Creutz on a method for recovering uranium from its salts. A vexing question at the time was how a production reactor should be cooled. Taking a conservative view that every possible neutron must be preserved, the majority opinion initially favored cooling with helium, which would absorb very few neutrons. Szilard argued that if this was a concern, then liquid bismuth would be a better choice. He supervised experiments with it, but the practical difficulties turned out to be too great. In the end, Wigner's plan to use ordinary water as a coolant won out. When the coolant issue became too heated, Compton and the director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., moved to dismiss Szilard, who was still a German citizen, but the Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, refused to do so. Szilard was therefore present on December 2, 1942, when the first man-made self- sustaining nuclear chain reaction was achieved in the first nuclear reactor under viewing stands of Stagg Field, and shook Fermi's hand. Szilard became a naturalized citizen of the United States in March 1943. The Army offered Szilard $25,000 for his inventions before November 1940, when he officially joined the project. He refused. He was the co-holder, with Fermi, of the patent on the nuclear reactor. In the end he sold his patent to the government for reimbursement of his expenses, some $15,416, plus the standard $1 fee. He continued to work with Fermi and Wigner on nuclear reactor design, and is credited with coining the term \\"breeder reactor\\". With an enduring passion for the preservation of human life and political freedom, Szilard hoped that the U.S. government would not use nuclear weapons, but that the mere threat of such weapons would force Germany and Japan to surrender. He also worried about the long-term implications of nuclear weapons, predicting that their use by the United States would start a nuclear arms race with the USSR. He drafted the Szil√°rd petition advocating that the atomic bomb be demonstrated to the enemy, and used only if the enemy did not then surrender. The Interim Committee instead chose to use atomic bombs against cities over the protests of Szilard and other scientists. Afterwards, he lobbied for amendments to the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 that placed nuclear energy under civilian control. After the war CP-1, at the University of Chicago, some years after the war. It was demolished in 1957. In 1946, Szilard secured a research professorship at the University of Chicago that allowed him to research in biology and the social sciences. He teamed up with Aaron Novick, a chemist who had worked at the Metallurgical Laboratory during the war. The two men saw biology as a field that had not been explored as much as physics, and was ready for scientific breakthroughs. It was a field that Szilard had been working on in 1933 before he had become subsumed in the quest for a nuclear chain reaction. The duo made considerable advances. They invented the chemostat, a device for regulating the growth rate of the microorganisms in a bioreactor, The chemostat was independently invented the same year by Jacques Monod. and developed methods for measuring the growth rate of bacteria. They discovered feedback inhibition, an important factor in processes such as growth and metabolism. Szilard gave essential advice to Theodore Puck and Philip I. Marcus for their first cloning of a human cell in 1955. Personal life Before his relation with his later wife Gertrud Weiss, Leo Szilard's life partner in the period 1927‚Äì1934 was the kindergarten teacher and opera singer Gerda Philipsborn, who also worked as a volunteer in a Berlin asylum organization for refugee children and in 1932 moved to India to continue this work. Szilard married Weiss, a physician, in a civil ceremony in New York on October 13, 1951. They had known each other since 1929 and had frequently corresponded and visited each other ever since. Weiss took up a teaching position at the University of Colorado in April 1950, and Szilard began staying with her in Denver for weeks at a time when they had never been together for more than a few days before. Single people living together was frowned upon in the conservative United States at the time and, after they were discovered by one of her students, Szilard began to worry that she might lose her job. Their relationship remained a long-distance one, and they kept news of their marriage quiet. Many of his friends were shocked, having considered Szilard a born bachelor. alt= Writings In 1949 Szilard wrote a short story titled \\"My Trial as a War Criminal\\" in which he imagined himself on trial for crimes against humanity after the United States lost a war with the Soviet Union. He publicly sounded the alarm against the possible development of salted thermonuclear bombs, explaining in a University of Chicago Round Table radio program on February 26, 1950, that sufficiently big thermonuclear bomb rigged with specific but common materials, might annihilate mankind. His comments, as well as those of Hans Bethe, Harrison Brown, and Frederick Seitz (the three other scientists who participated in the program), were attacked by the Atomic Energy Commission's former Chairman David Lilienthal, and the criticisms plus a response from Szilard were published. Time compared Szilard to Chicken Little while the AEC dismissed his ideas, but scientists debated whether it was feasible or not. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists commissioned a study by James R. Arnold, who concluded that it was. Physicist W. H. Clark suggested that a 50,000 megaton cobalt bomb did have the potential to produce sufficient long-lasting radiation to be a doomsday weapon, in theory, but was of the view that, even then, \\"enough people might find refuge to wait out the radioactivity and emerge to begin again.\\" Szilard published a book of short stories, The Voice of the Dolphins (1961), in which he dealt with the moral and ethical issues raised by the Cold War and his own role in the development of atomic weapons. The title story described an international biology research laboratory in Central Europe. This became reality after a meeting in 1962 with Victor F. Weisskopf, James Watson and John Kendrew. When the European Molecular Biology Laboratory was established, the library was named The Szilard Library and the library stamp features dolphins. Other honors that he received included the Atoms for Peace Award in 1959, and the Humanist of the Year in 1960. A lunar crater on the far side of the Moon was named after him in 1970. The Leo Szilard Lectureship Award, established in 1974, is given in his honor by the American Physical Society. Cancer diagnosis and treatment In 1960, Szilard was diagnosed with bladder cancer. He underwent cobalt therapy at New York's Memorial Sloan- Kettering Hospital using a cobalt 60 treatment regimen that his doctors gave him a high degree of control over. A second round of treatment with an increased dose followed in 1962. The higher dose did its job and his cancer never returned. Last Years Szilard spent his last years as a fellow of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in the La Jolla community of San Diego, California, which he had helped to create. Szilard founded Council for a Livable World in 1962 to deliver \\"the sweet voice of reason\\" about nuclear weapons to Congress, the White House, and the American public. He was appointed a non-resident fellow there in July 1963, and became a resident fellow on April 1, 1964, after moving to San Diego in February. With Trude, he lived in a bungalow on the property of the Hotel del Charro. On May 30, 1964, he died there in his sleep of a heart attack; when Trude awoke, she was unable to revive him. His remains were cremated. His papers are in the library at the University of California, San Diego. In February 2014, the library announced that they received funding from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission to digitize its collection of his papers, extending from 1938 to 1998.

It can be obtained by reduction of glucose, which changes the converted aldehyde group (‚àíCHO) to a primary alcohol group (‚àíC(OH)H2). Most sorbitol is made from potato starch, but it is also found in nature, for example in apples, pears, peaches, and prunes. It is converted to fructose by sorbitol-6-phosphate 2-dehydrogenase. Sorbitol is an isomer of mannitol, another sugar alcohol; the two differ only in the orientation of the hydroxyl group on carbon 2.Kearsley, M. W.; Deis, R. C. Sorbitol and Mannitol. In Sweeteners and Sugar Alternatives in Food Technology; Ames: Oxford, 2006; pp 249-249-261. While similar, the two sugar alcohols have very different sources in nature, melting points, and uses. It has a pKa of 13.14 +/- .2 Synthesis Sorbitol may be synthesised via a glucose reduction reaction in which the converted aldehyde group is converted into a hydroxyl group. The reaction requires NADH and is catalyzed by aldose reductase. Glucose reduction is the first step of the polyol pathway of glucose metabolism, and is implicated in multiple diabetic complications. :center The mechanism involves a tyrosine residue in the active site of aldehyde reductase. The hydrogen atom on NADH is transferred to the electrophilic aldehyde carbon atom; electrons on the aldehyde carbon-oxygen double bond are transferred to the oxygen that abstracts the proton on tyrosine side chain to form the hydroxyl group. The role of aldehyde reductase tyrosine phenol group is to serve as a general acid to provide proton to the reduced aldehyde oxygen on glucose. :centerGlucose reduction is not the major glucose metabolism pathway in a normal human body, where the glucose level is in the normal range. However, in diabetic patients whose blood glucose level is high, up to 1/3 of their glucose could go through the glucose reduction pathway. This will consume NADH and eventually leads to cell damage. :Sorbitol also may be synthesized through a catalytic hydrogenation of d-glucose to form d-sorbitol.SRINIVASAN, K.; GUNDEKARI, S. India Patent WO2017/60922. April 13, 2017. This reaction has a 100% yield of d-sorbitol when d-glucose is reacted with hydrogen in water at 120 degrees Celsius, under 150001.5 Torr, for 1 hour. Uses Sweetener Sorbitol is a sugar substitute, and when used in food it has the INS number and E number 420. Sorbitol is about 60% as sweet as sucrose (table sugar).Sugar substitute Sorbitol is referred to as a nutritive sweetener because it provides dietary energy: 2.6 kilocalories (11 kilojoules) per gram versus the average 4 kilocalories (17 kilojoules) for carbohydrates. It is often used in diet foods (including diet drinks and ice cream), mints, cough syrups, and sugar-free chewing gum. Most bacteria cannot use sorbitol for energy, but it can be slowly fermented in the mouth by Streptococcus mutans, a bacterium that causes tooth decay. In contrast, many other sugar alcohols such as isomalt and xylitol are considered non- acidogenic. It also occurs naturally in many stone fruits and berries from trees of the genus Sorbus. Medical applications =Laxative= As is the case with other sugar alcohols, foods containing sorbitol can cause gastrointestinal distress. Sorbitol can be used as a laxative when taken orally or as an enema. Sorbitol works as a laxative by drawing water into the large intestine, stimulating bowel movements.ACS :: Cancer Drug Guide: sorbitol Sorbitol has been determined safe for use by the elderly, although it is not recommended without the advice of a doctor. Sorbitol is found in some dried fruits and may contribute to the laxative effects of prunes. Sorbitol was first discovered in the fresh juice of mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia) berries in 1872. It is also found in the fruits of apples, plums, pears, cherries, dates, peaches and apricots. =Other medical applications= Sorbitol is used in bacterial culture media to distinguish the pathogenic Escherichia coli O157:H7 from most other strains of E. coli, because it is usually unable to ferment sorbitol, unlike 93% of known E. coli strains. A treatment for hyperkalaemia (elevated blood potassium) uses sorbitol and the ion-exchange resin sodium polystyrene sulfonate (tradename Kayexalate). The resin exchanges sodium ions for potassium ions in the bowel, while sorbitol helps to eliminate it. In 2010, the U.S. FDA issued a warning of increased risk for gastrointestinal necrosis with this combination. Sorbitol is also used in the manufacture of softgel capsules to store single doses of liquid medicines. Health care, food, and cosmetic uses Sorbitol often is used in modern cosmetics as a humectant and thickener. It is also used in mouthwash and toothpaste. Some transparent gels can be made only with sorbitol, because of its high refractive index. Sorbitol is used as a cryoprotectant additive (mixed with sucrose and sodium polyphosphates) in the manufacture of surimi, a processed fish paste. It is also used as a humectant in some cigarettes. Beyond its use as a sugar substitute in reduced-sugar foods, Sorbitol is also used as a humectant in cookies and low-moisture foods like peanut butter and fruit preserves. In baking, it is also valuable because it acts as a plasticizer, and slows down the staling process. Miscellaneous uses A mixture of sorbitol and potassium nitrate has found some success as an amateur solid rocket fuel. Sorbitol is identified as a potential key chemical intermediate for production of fuels from biomass resources. Carbohydrate fractions in biomass such as cellulose undergo sequential hydrolysis and hydrogenation in the presence of metal catalysts to produce sorbitol. Complete reduction of sorbitol opens the way to alkanes, such as hexane, which can be used as a biofuel. Hydrogen required for this reaction can be produced by aqueous phase catalytic reforming of sorbitol. :19 C6H14O6 ‚Üí 13 C6H14 \\\\+ 36 CO2 \\\\+ 42 H2O The above chemical reaction is exothermic, and 1.5 moles of sorbitol generate approximately 1 mole of hexane. When hydrogen is co-fed, no carbon dioxide is produced. Sorbitol based polyols are used in the production of polyurethane foam for the construction industry. It is also added after electroporation of yeasts in transformation protocols, allowing the cells to recover by raising the osmolarity of the medium. Medical importance Aldose reductase is the first enzyme in the sorbitol-aldose reductase pathway responsible for the reduction of glucose to sorbitol, as well as the reduction of galactose to galactitol. Too much sorbitol trapped in retinal cells, the cells of the lens, and the Schwann cells that myelinate peripheral nerves, is a frequent result of long-term hyperglycemia that accompanies poorly controlled diabetes. This can damage these cells, leading to retinopathy, cataracts and peripheral neuropathy, respectively. Aldose reductase inhibitors, which are substances that prevent or slow the action of aldose reductase, are currently being investigated as a way to prevent or delay these complications. Sorbitol is fermented in the colon and produces short-chain fatty acids, which are beneficial to overall colon health. Adverse medical effects People with untreated celiac disease often present sorbitol malabsorption, as a result of the small bowel damage. Sorbitol malabsorption is an important cause for persisting symptoms in patients already on a gluten- free diet. The sorbitol hydrogen breath test has been suggested as a tool to detect celiac disease because of a strict correlation between cut-off value and intestinal lesions. Nevertheless, although it may be indicated for research purposes, it is not yet recommended as a diagnostic tool in clinical practice. It has been noted that the sorbitol added to sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS, used in the treatment of hyperkalemia) can cause complications in the gastrointestinal tract, including bleeding, perforated colonic ulcers, ischemic colitis and colonic necrosis, particularly in patients with uremia. Risk factors for sorbitol-induced damage include immunosuppression, hypovolemia, postoperative setting, hypotension after hemodialysis, and peripheral vascular disease. SPS-sorbitol should therefore be used carefully in the management of hyperkalemia. Overdose effects Ingesting large amounts of sorbitol can lead to abdominal pain, flatulence, and mild to severe diarrhea. Habitual sorbitol consumption of over per day as sugar-free gum has led to severe diarrhea, causing unintended weight loss or even requiring hospitalization. In early studies, a dose of 25g of sorbitol, eaten through the day, produced a laxative effect in only 5% of individuals. As a result of the large molecular weight of sorbitol, when large amounts of sorbitol are ingested, only a small amount of sorbitol is absorbed in the small intestine, and most of the sorbitol enters the colon, with consequent gastrointestinal effects.

The discipline is known to have originated when Olav Zipser began experimenting with non-traditional forms of bodyflight. Zipser founded the FreeFly Clowns as a two-person competitive team with Mike Vail in 1992, and was joined by Omar Alhegelan (1st ever FAI Freestyle World Cup & World Champion), Charles Bryan, and Stefania Martinengo in 1994. The FreeFly Clowns are also credited with opening the first school to teach freeflying, The First School of Modern SkyFlying. FreeFlyers training with a Space Ball for the Space Games Freeflying broke into the limelight in 1996 when the SSI Pro Tour added freeflying as a three-person competitive discipline at the second televised event (with Skysurfing), part of ESPN's Destination Extreme series. 150 countries watched the FreeFly Clowns (Olav Zipser, Charles Bryan and Omar Alhegelan) as they took 1st place in all four international competitions along with other teams like, the Flyboyz (Eli Thompson, Mike Ortiz, Knut Krecker, Fritz Pfn√ºr), Team AirTime (Tony Urugallo, Jim O'Reilly, Peter Raymond, Brian Germain), and many other pioneers of freeflying showed off their best moves. In 1996 and 1997, the SSI Pro Tour staged eight televised events in both North America and Europe with $36,000 in cash prizes awarded to freefly teams. SSI invited the 1997 Pro World Champions, the Flyboyz, to participate in the 1998 ESPN X Games as an unofficial exhibition. The resulting global television exposure made legends out of the FreeFly Clowns, the Flyboyz, and others. A once fledgling offshoot of the mainstream, freeflying now comprises fully one-half of the overall skydiving community. Olav Zipser's Space Games used the space ball as a research and measuring device to provide a constant speed and direction from which individual athletes could be trained, rated, raced against each other and judged. The Space Games took FreeFlying to the next level from 1998. British Parachute Association article, retrieved 10 Sep 2012 Thanks to the efforts by Arizona Freeflight llc (Omar Alhegelan & Kama Mountz) who ran test competitions & wrote and submitted the rules for futures competitions; In 2000 FreeFly was accepted as a skydiving discipline by the International Parachute Commission (IPC) and the first official FreeFly National & international Championships were held worldwide. Explanation Freeflying is an expansion of skydiving which includes the traditional belly-to-earth positions, but extends into vertical flight where the flyer is in an upright position (falling feet first) or in an inverted position (falling head first). These positions increase freefall speeds and make new types of formations and routines possible. A freeflyer, in order to fully understand the aerodynamic power of his/her body in freefall, needs to first learn to control all of the skydiving forms: box position (belly-to-earth, traditional skydiving position), back flying (back-to-earth), head-up flying, head-down flying, and side flying. These positions are not held for the duration of a skydive. Freeflying can, and usually does, involve constant transitions in position and speeds, with vertical and horizontal orientations. This can involve constantly flowing skydives, with all positions explored, or more static skydives where flyers are concentrating on building a large formation while flying in one of these freefly positions. Due to the increased freefall speed and potentially faster horizontal speeds, freeflying has dangers beyond that of a normal skydive. Extra care must be taken for freefall skydive groups to stay away from belly-to-earth skydivers to avoid collisions. Since most parachutes are not designed to be opened at speeds higher than that of normal belly flying, freeflyers must transition back to the \\"belly to earth\\" position and slow down their descent for several seconds before deploying their parachute. While freeflying is a younger and more extreme addition to skydiving, it is becoming a popular event in competitions and world records. Back flying Back flying is the ability to fly on the back in a stable and controlled fashion. This skill is critical so that when the flyer flips out of some of the more advanced positions he or she stays in control and does not endanger his- or herself or other skydivers. Sit flying Freeflyer flying a sit in Manaus, Brasil. Sit flying is called such because it looks similar to the position taken while sitting in a chair. For flying a sit, the feet are oriented toward the relative wind and 90-degree bends maintained at the knees, hips, and shoulders. To move around, the flyer redirects the airflow in the opposite direction the jumper wants to go. Newtonian mechanics then push the flyer in the desired direction. Fall rate changes (descending faster or slower) can also be made.  Head down  A person falling in the head down position has less cross-sectional area exposed to the air while falling, which results in much faster fall rates. Average speeds while flying head down are around . Due to the increased speed, every movement made can cause the skydiver to become unstable or disoriented; thus increasing the risk involved in skydiving.  Records  The world's largest vertical (head down) formation took place on Friday, 31 July 2015, when a multinational team of 164 skydivers, some traveling at speeds of over 200 mph, linked over Skydive Chicago,http://skydivechicago.com in Ottawa, Illinois, United States.https://www.usnews.com/news/sports/articles/2015/07/31/164-skydivers- set-head-down-world-record-in-illinois This broke the previous record of 138 linked skydivers, set on Saturday, 4 August 2012, also at Skydive Chicago. Marc Hauser set the world record for the fastest horizontal free fall at 304 km/h in Empuriabrava, Spain, without specialized equipment, in October 2012.

He initially qualified as an engineer, but he re-trained as a barrister to effectively fight for social causes which deeply concerned him. After a long political career, mostly spent as Attorney-General, he was appointed a Senior Justice of the Supreme Court of Tasmania. Despite being acknowledged as the leading expert on the Australian Constitution, he was never appointed to the High Court of Australia. He popularised the Hare-Clark voting system, and introduced it to Tasmania. In addition Clark was a prolific author, though most of his writings were never published, rather they were circulated privately. Clark was also Vice-Chancellor of the University of Tasmania. Throughout his life, Clark was a progressive. He championed the rights of workers to organise through trades unions, universal suffrage (including women's suffrage) and the rights to a fair trial ‚Äì all issues which today we take for granted, but were so radical in the 1880s that he was described as a 'communist' by the Hobart Mercury. \\"Clark was an Australian Jefferson, who, like the great American Republican, fought for Australian independence; an autonomous judiciary; a wider franchise and lower property qualifications; fairer electoral boundaries; checks and balances between the judicature, legislature and executive; modern, liberal universities; and a Commonwealth that was federal, independent and based on natural rights.\\" p35 Yet he also had a rich and warm home life. He is described as \\"never too busy to mend a toy for a child, and his wife once wrote on hearing of his imminent return from America: 'to celebrate your return I must do something or bust'\\". The Australian federal Division of Clark is named after him. Early life and marriage Clark was born in Hobart, Tasmania, the son of a Scottish engineer, Alexander Clark. He was educated at Hobart High School.Note there is no link to the modern state-run Hobart High School. The school Clark attended was a private foundation funded by subscription. After leaving school, he was apprenticed to his family's engineering business, becoming a qualified engineer, and finally its business manager. His father had established a highly successful engineering business, based on an iron foundry. The business was also involved with industrial design and construction of flour mills, water mills, coal mines and other substantial undertaking. right He grew to manhood during the 1860s, when the major issue, even in remote Tasmania, was the American Civil War and emancipation. This last issue had an especial resonance in Tasmania where a form of slavery, transportation, had been abolished as recently as 1853. Convicts were still a common sight for years later. As late as 1902, Clark would publicly be moved to tears when discussing slavery. Clark became fascinated by all things American. In 1872, Clark disappointed his father by leaving to study law, becoming an articled clerk with R. P. Adams. He was called to the bar in 1877. Clark, as a child attended a Baptist Sabbatical School until 1872 when the chapel was dissolved on a motion put by Clark due to the \\"lack of discipline and proper order of government in worship.\\" He then joined a Unitarian chapel, which led him into contact with leading American Unitarians, including Moncure Conway and Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. The friendship formed with the latter would strongly influence his views and the development of the Clarks' draft of the Australian Constitution. Early in his life, Clark developed a passion for justice and liberty. He joined the Minerva Club where he participated in debate on contemporary social issues. In 1874, he edited its journal Quadrilateral. As a 'young ardent republican', he was also a member of the American Club, where at the 1876 annual dinner, he declared \\"We have met here tonight in the name of the principles which were proclaimed by the founders of the Anglo-American Republic‚Ä¶ and we do so because we believe those principles to be permanently applicable to the politics of the world\\". He was inspired by Italian Risorgimento, especially by Joseph Mazzini of whom he had a picture in every room. He became a radical, a democrat and a republican. In 1878 he married Grace Ross, the daughter of local shipbuilder John Ross, with whom he had five sons and two daughters: \\"Rosebank\\" ‚Äì home of Andrew Inglis Clark located in Battery Point * Esma (1878) * Alexander (1879) Marine engineer * Andrew (1882) Justice of the Supreme Court of Tasmania 1928‚Äì1953. * Conway (1883) Architect * Wendell (1885) Doctor * Melvyn (1886/1887?)There are two differing dates of birth for Melvyn Inglis Clark * Correl (1888) Clerk of Tasmanian Legislative Council * Ethel (1889) One of the many mysteries of Clark's private life is the circumstances of his marriage. As the son of a prominent family, and a leading figure of his church who was marrying the daughter of a well-known businessman, his marriage might have been expected to be a major social event. Instead, they slipped away to Melbourne, where they were married in the presence of a few friends. Political career In 1878, Clark stood for election to the House of Assembly, despite his reputation as an extreme ultra- republican. He was attacked by the Hobart Mercury for \\"holding such very extreme ultra-republican, if not revolutionary, ideas\\" that his proper place should be among the 'Communists', and the Launceston Examiner as a \\"stranger from Hobart\\". He was elected, unopposed to the electorate of Norfolk Plains. His election was largely due to the influence of Thomas Reibey, a political power broker and a recent Premier. Clark was the founder of the Southern Tasmania Political Reform Association, whose agenda included manhood suffrage, fixed term parliaments, and electoral reform. While a member of the House of Assembly, Clark was regarded as republican and ultra-progressive. He was one of the few members legislate as a backbencher and introduce a private members bill. He failed to reform industrial law by amending the Master and Servant Act, but he succeeded with the Criminal Procedure Amendment Act in 1881.The ADB refers to \\"Criminal Law Amendment Act\\" of 1880. The Tasmania House of Assembly records do not include an Act with this title. There was however a \\"Criminal Procedure Amendment Act\\" in 1880. This confusion is complicated by the lack of a Hansard service prior to 1979. He also assisted with reframing the customs tariff. In the 1882 election, Clark was defeated. He failed when he stood for election in 1884 (East Hobart) and 1886 (South Hobart). In 1887, Clark was re-elected, in a by-election as member for East Hobart. In 1888, he was re-elected as member for South Hobart and remained there until the seat was abolished in 1897. He was then the member for Hobart until he resigned upon his appointment to the Supreme Court in 1898. In March 1888, he became Attorney General in the government of Sir Philip Fysh. Since the Premier was in the Legislative Council, Clark was responsible for introducing legislation into the Assembly. Over the next five years he shepherded through the lower house much progressive and humanitarian legislation. His goal was to break the power of property in Tasmanian politics. The legislation covered such diverse reforms as legalising trades unions, providing parliamentary salaries, preventing cruelty to animals, reforming laws on lunacy, trusteeship and companies, the custody of children and the protection of children from neglect and abuse. He also introduced laws to restrict the immigration of Chinese. Clark failed in his attempts to impose a land tax, introduce universal (including female) suffrage and centralise the police. Clark was the most important 19th-century Attorney-General of Tasmania. His considerable drafting skills enabled him to modernise and simplify the law over a number of areas. He introduced a total of 228 bills into the Assembly. His best known achievement as Attorney-General was the introduction of proportional representation based on the Hare-Clark system of the single transferable vote. Map of the Mainline Railway, circa 1880 One of the major political issues addressed by Clark during his career concerned the Tasmanian Main Line Railway ‚Äì a railway which connected Tasmania's two main cites, Hobart and Launceston. In 1873, the Main Line Railway Company began the construction of the line, which opened in 1876. There were a series of disputes between the Company and the government over payments due to the Company under its Deed of Concession.ADB Audley Coote, Chief Engineer of the Mainline Railway Co Clark had spoken about the problem, advocating the acquisition of the Company by the government as early as 1878. With his dual qualifications as both an engineer and a lawyer, Clark was in a unique position to understand the issues involved. As Attorney-General, he was the government's chief negotiator. In 1889, the Supreme Court awarded the Company arrears of interest. Clark urged the government to appeal, and in 1890 he went to England to argue the case before the Privy Council. Clark may have been a poor speaker in court, but he was a superb negotiator. It was his forte. With full powers, he settled the case out of court by arranging the purchase of the Company's property by the government. In 1891, Clark returned to Tasmania from London by way of the United States. It was a fateful choice. He was introduced to a fellow Unitarian Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr, with whom he corresponded for the rest of his life. The contacts and people he met in Boston were to profoundly inform his views about political constitutions. Not the least of the consequences was the introduction of the term Commonwealth to describe the Australian polity. In 1892, the fall of the Fysh government ended Clark's term as Attorney- General. When Sir Edward Braddon formed a government in 1894, Clark again became Attorney-General, the same year he was given the title 'Honourable' for life. He resigned in 1897, when his colleagues failed to consult him over the lease of Crown land to private interests, after which he became Leader of the Opposition. Clark left politics to become a Justice of the Supreme Court of Tasmania in 1898. Hare‚ÄìClark electoral system In 1896, after several failed attempts, Clark was able to get a system of proportional representation adopted by the Tasmanian Parliament, but it was to be only on a trial basis for both Hobart (to elect 6 MPs) and Launceston (to elect 4 MPs). The modified single transferable vote method, immediately known as the Hare‚ÄìClark system, was renewed annually until suspended in 1902. Clark died in 1907, just as permanent proportional representation struggled through Parliament and over a year before it was used for the first time throughout Tasmania at the general election in April 1909. Early legal career Clark was called to bar in 1877. He soon gained a reputation as a criminal lawyer in a 'poisoning case', but went on to gain a large practice in civil and commercial law as well. He practiced law both while in and out of parliament. During those periods when he was not serving as Attorney-General, he worked hard to build a successful practice. He failed to find his fortune in the law due to his generosity and refusal 'to accept anything beyond a reasonable and modest fee'. In 1887 he went into partnership with Matthew Wilkes Simmons. His career in private practice gave him a broad grounding in the law which stood him in good stead once he was promoted to the bench. Clark was knowledgeable in all branches of the law, but pre-eminent as a constitutional lawyer and jurist. Clark, never in robust health, in fact described as \\"small, spare, [and] nervous\\" by Alfred Deakin, died at his home 'Rosebank' in Battery Point on 14 November 1907. He is buried in the old Queenborough Cemetery at Sandy Bay.

The term Mass is commonly used in the Catholic Church, and in the Western Rite Orthodox, and Old Catholic churches. The term is used in some Lutheran churches, as well as in some Anglican churches. It is rarely, if ever, used by other Protestant churches, such as in Methodism. Other Christian denominations may employ terms such as Divine Service or worship service (and often just \\"service\\"), rather than the word Mass. For the celebration of the Eucharist in Eastern Christianity, including Eastern Catholic Churches, other terms such as Divine Liturgy, Holy Qurbana, and Badarak are typically used instead. Etymology The English noun mass is derived from Middle Latin missa. The Latin word was adopted in Old English as m√¶sse (via a Vulgar Latin form *messa), and was sometimes glossed as sendnes (i.e. 'a sending, dismission').Bosworth-Toller, s.v. sendness (citing Wright, Vocabularies vol. 2, 1873), \\"m√¶sse\\" (citing √Ülfric of Eynsham). The Latin term missa itself was in use by the 6th century. It is used by Caesarius of Arles (e.g. Regula ad monachos, PL 67, 1102B Omni dominica sex missas facite). Before this, it occurs singularly in a letter attributed to Saint Ambrose (d. 397), Ego mansi in munere, missam facere coepi (ep. 20.3, PL 16, 0995A ). F. Probst, Liturgie der drei ersten christlichen Jahrhunderte, 1870, 5f.). \\"the fragment in Pseudo-Ambrose, 'De sacramentis' (about 400. Cf. P.L., XVI, 443), and the letter of Pope Innocent I (401-17) to Decentius of Eugubium (P.L., XX, 553). In these documents we see that the Roman Liturgy is said in Latin and has already become in essence the rite we still use.\\" (Fortescue 1910). It is most likely derived from the concluding formula Ite, missa est (\\"Go; the dismissal is made\\"); missa here is a Late Latin substantive corresponding to classical missio. Historically, however, there have been other explanations of the noun missa, i.e. as not derived from the formula ite, missa est. Fortescue (1910) cites older, \\"fanciful\\" etymological explanations, notably a latinization of Hebrew matz√¢h (◊û÷∑◊¶÷∏÷º◊î) \\"unleavened bread; oblation\\", a derivation favoured in the 16th century by Reuchlin and Luther, or Greek \\"initiation\\", or even Germanic mese \\"assembly\\".The Germanic word is likely itself an early loan of Latin mensa \\"table\\". \\"The origin and first meaning of the word, once much discussed, is not really doubtful. We may dismiss at once such fanciful explanations as that missa is the Hebrew missah (\\"oblation\\" ‚Äî so Reuchlin and Luther), or the Greek myesis (\\"initiation\\"), or the German Mess (\\"assembly\\", \\"market\\"). Nor is it the participle feminine of mittere, with a noun understood (\\"oblatio missa ad Deum\\", \\"congregatio missa\\", i.e., dimissa ‚Äî so Diez, \\"Etymol. W√∂rterbuch der roman. Sprachen\\", 212, and others). Fortescue, A. (1910). Liturgy of the Mass. In The Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company. The French historian Du Cange in 1678 reported \\"various opinions on the origin\\" of the noun missa \\"mass\\", including the derivation from Hebrew matzah (Missah, id est, oblatio), here attributed to Caesar Baronius. The Hebrew derivation is learned speculation from 16th- century philology; medieval authorities did derive the noun missa from the verb mittere, but not in connection with the formula ite, missa est.De vocabuli origine vari√¶ sunt Scriptorum sententi√¶.

PL 170, 52A. Catholic Church The Catholic Church sees the Mass or Eucharist as \\"the source and summit of the Christian life\\", to which the other sacraments are oriented. Remembered in the Mass are Jesus' life, Last Supper, and sacrificial death on the cross at Calvary. The ordained celebrant (priest or bishop) is understood to act in persona Christi, as he recalls the words and gestures of Jesus Christ at the Last Supper and leads the congregation (always \\"we\\", never \\"I\\") in praise of God. The Mass is composed of two parts, the Liturgy of the Word and the Liturgy of the Eucharist. The term \\"Mass\\" is generally used only in the Roman Rite, while the Byzantine Rite Eastern Catholic Churches use the term \\"Divine Liturgy\\" for the celebration of the Eucharist, and other Eastern Catholic Churches have terms such as Holy Qurbana. Although similar in outward appearance to the Anglican Mass or Lutheran Mass, the Catholic Church distinguishes between its own Mass and theirs on the basis of what it views as the validity of the orders of their clergy, and as a result, does not ordinarily permit intercommunion between members of these Churches. In a 1993 letter to Bishop Johannes Hanselmann of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria, Cardinal Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) affirmed that \\"a theology oriented to the concept of succession [of bishops], such as that which holds in the Catholic and in the Orthodox church, need not in any way deny the salvation-granting presence of the Lord [Heilschaffende Gegenwart des Herrn] in a Lutheran [evangelische] Lord's Supper.\\" The Decree on Ecumenism, produced by Vatican II in 1964, records that the Catholic Church notes its understanding that when other faith groups (such as Lutherans, Anglicans, and Presbyterians) \\"commemorate His death and resurrection in the Lord's Supper, they profess that it signifies life in communion with Christ and look forward to His coming in glory.\\" Within the fixed structure outlined below, which is specific to the Ordinary Form of the Roman Rite, the Scripture readings, the antiphons sung or recited during the entrance procession or at Communion, and certain other prayers vary each day according to the liturgical calendar. For many variations and options not mentioned here, see the complete Order of the Mass. As regards those of other Christian faiths receiving Communion from a Catholic priest, Canon 844 allows that the sacrament may be shared with those \\"who cannot approach a minister of their own community\\", provided they believe in the real presence and are in the state of grace\\". This is frequently the case with the incarcerated. Introductory rites St Mary's Basilica, Bangalore The priest enters, with a deacon if there is one, and altar servers (who may act as crucifer, candle-bearers and thurifer). The priest makes the sign of the cross with the people and formally greets them. Of the options offered for the Introductory Rites, that preferred by liturgists would bridge the praise of the opening hymn with the Glory to God which follows. The Kyrie eleison here has from early times been an acclamation of God's mercy. The Penitential Act instituted by the Council of Trent is also still permitted here, with the caution that it should not turn the congregation in upon itself during these rites which are aimed at uniting those gathered as one praiseful congregation. The Introductory Rites are brought to a close by the Collect Prayer. Liturgy of the Word On Sundays and solemnities, three Scripture readings are given. On other days there are only two. If there are three readings, the first is from the Old Testament (a term wider than \\"Hebrew Scriptures\\", since it includes the Deuterocanonical Books), or the Acts of the Apostles during Eastertide. The first reading is followed by a psalm, recited or sung responsorially. The second reading is from the New Testament epistles, typically from one of the Pauline epistles. A Gospel acclamation is then sung as the Book of the Gospels is processed, sometimes with incense and candles, to the ambo; if not sung it may be omitted. The final reading and high point of the Liturgy of the Word is the proclamation of the Gospel by the deacon or priest. On all Sundays and Holy Days of Obligation, and preferably at all Masses, a homily or sermon that draws upon some aspect of the readings or the liturgy itself, is then given.GIRM, paragraph 66 The homily is preferably moral and hortatory. Finally, the Nicene Creed or, especially from Easter to Pentecost, the Apostles' Creed is professed on Sundays and solemnities,GIRM, paragraph 68 and the Universal Prayer or Prayer of the Faithful follows.GIRM, paragraph 69 The designation \\"of the faithful\\" comes from when catechumens did not remain for this prayer or for what follows. Liturgy of the Eucharist elevation of the host began in the 14th century to show people the consecrated host.alt= The Liturgy of the Eucharist begins with the preparation of the altar and gifts,GIRM, paragraph 73 while the collection may be taken. This concludes with the priest saying: \\"Pray, brethren, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the almighty Father.\\" The congregation stands and responds: \\"May the Lord accept the sacrifice at your hands, for the praise and glory of His name, for our good, and the good of all His holy Church.\\" The priest then pronounces the variable prayer over the gifts. Then in dialogue with the faithful the priest brings to mind the meaning of \\"eucharist\\", to give thanks to God. A variable prayer of thanksgiving follows, concluding with the acclamation \\"Holy, Holy ....Heaven and earth are full of your glory. ...Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.\\" The anaphora, or more properly \\"Eucharistic Prayer\\", follows, The oldest of the anaphoras of the Roman Rite, fixed since the Council of Trent, is called the Roman Canon, with central elements dating to the fourth century. With the liturgical renewal following the Second Vatican Council, numerous other Eucharistic prayers have been composed, including four for children's Masses. Central to the Eucharist is the Institution Narrative, recalling the words and actions of Jesus at his Last Supper, which he told his disciples to do in remembrance of him.; Then the congregation acclaims its belief in Christ's conquest over death, and their hope of eternal life.GIRM, paragraph 151 Since the early church an essential part of the Eucharistic prayer has been the epiclesis, the calling down of the Holy Spirit to sanctify our offering.GIRM, paragraph 79c The priest concludes with a doxology in praise of God's work, at which the people give their Amen to the whole Eucharistic prayer. Communion rite A priest administers Communion during Mass in a Dutch field in the front line, October 1944 All together recite or sing the \\"Lord's Prayer\\" (\\"Pater Noster\\" or \\"Our Father\\"). The priest introduces it with a short phrase and follows it up with a prayer called the embolism, after which the people respond with another doxology. The sign of peace is exchanged and then the \\"Lamb of God\\" (\\"Agnus Dei\\" in Latin) litany is sung or recited while the priest breaks the host and places a piece in the main chalice; this is known as the rite of fraction and commingling. Out of Mass (1893), oil on canvas by Joan Ferrer Mir√≥ The priest then displays the consecrated elements to the congregation, saying: \\"Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world. Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb,\\" to which all respond: \\"Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\\" Then Communion is given, often with lay ministers assisting with the consecrated wine.GIRM, paragraph 160 According to Catholic teaching, one should be in the state of grace, without mortal sin, to receive Communion. Singing by all the faithful during the Communion procession is encouraged \\"to express the communicants' union in spirit\\"GIRM, paragraph 86 from the bread that makes them one. A silent time for reflection follows, and then the variable concluding prayer of the Mass. Concluding rite The priest imparts a blessing over those present. The deacon or, in his absence, the priest himself then dismisses the people, choosing a formula by which the people are \\"sent forth\\" to spread the good news. The congregation responds: \\"Thanks be to God.\\" A recessional hymn is sung by all, as the ministers process to the rear of the church. Western Rite Orthodox Churches Since most Eastern Orthodox Christians use the Byzantine Rite, most Eastern Orthodox Churches call their Eucharistic service \\"the Divine Liturgy.\\" However, there are a number of parishes within the Eastern Orthodox Church which use an edited version of the Latin Rite. Most parishes use the \\"Divine Liturgy of St. Tikhon\\" which is a revision of the Anglican Book of Common Prayer, or \\"the Divine Liturgy of St. Gregory\\" which is derived from the Tridentine form of the Roman Rite Mass. These rubrics have been revised to reflect the doctrine and dogmas of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Therefore, the filioque clause has been removed, a fuller epiclesis has been added, and use of leavened bread has been introduced.

In the Anglican tradition, Mass is one of many terms for the Eucharist. More frequently, the term used is either Holy Communion, Holy Eucharist, or the Lord's Supper. Occasionally the term used in Eastern churches, the Divine Liturgy, is also used. In the English-speaking Anglican world, the term used often identifies the Eucharistic theology of the person using it. \\"Mass\\" is frequently used by Anglo-Catholics. Structure of the rite The various Eucharistic liturgies used by national churches of the Anglican Communion have continuously evolved from the 1549 and 1552 editions of the Book of Common Prayer, both of which owed their form and contents chiefly to the work of Thomas Cranmer, who in about 1547 had rejected the medieval theology of the Mass. Although the 1549 rite retained the traditional sequence of the Mass, its underlying theology was Cranmer's and the four-day debate in the House of Lords during December 1548 makes it clear that this had already moved far beyond traditional Catholicism. In the 1552 revision, this was made clear by the restructuring of the elements of the rite while retaining nearly all the language so that it became, in the words of an Anglo-Catholic liturgical historian (Arthur Couratin) \\"a series of communion devotions; disembarrassed of the Mass with which they were temporarily associated in 1548 and 1549\\". Some rites, such as the 1637 Scottish rite and the 1789 rite in the United States, went back to the 1549 model. From the time of the Elizabethan Settlement in 1559 the services allowed for a certain variety of theological interpretation. Today's rites generally follow the same general five-part shape. Some or all of the following elements may be altered, transposed or absent depending on the rite, the liturgical season and use of the province or national church: * Gathering: Begins with a Trinitarian-based greeting or seasonal acclamation (\\"Blessed be God: Father, Son and Holy spirit. And Blessed be his kingdom, now and forever. Amen\\").Book of Common Prayer p. 355 Holy Eucharist Rite II Then the Kyrie and a general confession and absolution follow. On Sundays outside Advent and Lent and on major festivals, the Gloria in Excelsis Deo is sung or said. The entrance rite then concludes with the collect of the day. * Proclaiming and Hearing the Word: Usually two to three readings of Scripture, one of which is always from the Gospels, plus a psalm (or portion thereof) or canticle between the lessons. This is followed by a sermon or homily; the recitation of one of the Creeds, viz., the Apostles' or Nicene, is done on Sundays and feasts. * The Prayers of the People: Quite varied in their form. * The Peace: The people stand and greet one another and exchange signs of God's peace in the name of the Lord. It functions as a bridge between the prayers, lessons, sermon and creeds to the Communion part of the Eucharist. *The Celebration of the Eucharist: The gifts of bread and wine are brought up, along with other gifts (such as money or food for a food bank, etc.), and an offertory prayer is recited. Following this, a Eucharistic Prayer (called \\"The Great Thanksgiving\\") is offered. This prayer consists of a dialogue (the Sursum Corda), a preface, the sanctus and benedictus, the Words of Institution, the Anamnesis, an Epiclesis, a petition for salvation, and a Doxology. The Lord's Prayer precedes the fraction (the breaking of the bread), followed by the Prayer of Humble Access or the Agnus Dei and the distribution of the sacred elements (the bread and wine). *Dismissal: There is a post- Communion prayer, which is a general prayer of thanksgiving. The service concludes with a Trinitarian blessing and the dismissal. The liturgy is divided into two main parts: The Liturgy of the Word (Gathering, Proclaiming and Hearing the Word, Prayers of the People) and the Liturgy of the Eucharist (together with the Dismissal), but the entire liturgy itself is also properly referred to as the Holy Eucharist. The sequence of the liturgy is almost identical to the Roman Rite, except the Confession of Sin ends the Liturgy of the Word in the Anglican rites in North America, while in the Roman Rite (when used) and in Anglican rites in many jurisdictions the Confession is near the beginning of the service. Special Masses The Anglican tradition includes separate rites for nuptial, funeral, and votive Masses. The Eucharist is an integral part of many other sacramental services, including ordination and Confirmation. Ceremonial Some Anglo-Catholic parishes use Anglican versions of the Tridentine Missal, such as the English Missal, The Anglican Missal, or the American Missal, for the celebration of Mass, all of which are intended primarily for the celebration of the Eucharist, or use the order for the Eucharist in Common Worship arranged according to the traditional structure, and often with interpolations from the Roman Rite. In the Episcopal Church (United States), a traditional-language, Anglo-Catholic adaptation of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer has been published (An Anglican Service Book). All of these books contain such features as meditations for the presiding celebrant(s) during the liturgy, and other material such as the rite for the blessing of palms on Palm Sunday, propers for special feast days, and instructions for proper ceremonial order. These books are used as a more expansively Catholic context in which to celebrate the liturgical use found in the Book of Common Prayer and related liturgical books. In England supplementary liturgical texts for the proper celebration of Festivals, Feast days and the seasons is provided in Common Worship; Times and Seasons (2013), Festivals (Common Worship: Services and Prayers for the Church of England) (2008) and Common Worship: Holy Week and Easter (2011). These are often supplemented in Anglo-Catholic parishes by books specifying ceremonial actions, such as A Priest's Handbook by Dennis G. Michno, Ceremonies of the Eucharist by Howard E. Galley, Low Mass Ceremonial by C.P.A. Burnett, and Ritual Notes by E.C.R. Lamburn. Other guides to ceremonial include the General Instruction of the Roman Missal, Ceremonies of the Modern Roman Rite (Peter Elliott), Ceremonies of the Roman Rite Described (Adrian Fortescue), and The Parson's Handbook (Percy Dearmer). In Evangelical Anglican parishes, the rubrics detailed in the Book of Common Prayer are sometimes considered normative. Lutheranism elevates the chalice in the celebration of the Holy Mass. In the Book of Concord, Article XXIV (\\"Of the Mass\\") of the Augsburg Confession (1530) begins thus: > Falsely are our churches accused of abolishing the Mass; for the Mass is > retained among us, and celebrated with the highest reverence. We do not > abolish the Mass but religiously keep and defend it. ...We keep the > traditional liturgical form. ...In our churches Mass is celebrated every > Sunday and on other holy days, when the sacrament is offered to those who > wish for it after they have been examined and absolved (Article XXIV). Martin Luther rejected parts of the Roman Rite Catholic Mass, specifically the Canon of the Mass, which, as he argued, did not conform with . That verse contrasts the Old Testament priests, who needed to make a sacrifice for sins on a regular basis, with the single priest Christ, who offers his body only once as a sacrifice. The theme is carried out also in , , and . Luther composed as a replacement a revised Latin-language rite, Formula missae, in 1523, and the vernacular Deutsche Messe in 1526. As such, historically, the Lutheran Church has stated that the Lutheran Mass is \\"the only Mass founded in the Scriptures of God, in accordance with the plain and incontestable institution of the Saviour.\\" Scandinavian, Finnish, and some English speaking Lutherans, use the term \\"Mass\\" for their Eucharistic service,; see also Deutsche Messe but in most German and English-speaking churches, the terms \\"Divine Service\\", \\"Holy Communion, or \\"the Holy Eucharist\\" are used. The celebration of the Mass in Lutheran churches follows a similar pattern to other traditions, starting with public confession (Confiteor) by all and a Declaration of Grace said by the priest or pastor. There follow the Introit, Kyrie, Gloria, collect, the readings with an alleluia (alleluia is not said during Lent), homily (or sermon) and recitation of the Nicene Creed. The Service of the Eucharist includes the General intercessions, Preface, Sanctus and Eucharistic Prayer, elevation of the host and chalice and invitation to the Eucharist. The Agnus Dei is chanted while the clergy and assistants first commune, followed by lay communicants. Postcommunion prayers and the final blessing by the priest ends the Mass. A Catholic or Anglican of the Anglo- Catholic party would find its elements familiar, in particular the use of the sign of the cross, kneeling for prayer and the Eucharistic Prayer, bowing to the processional crucifix, kissing the altar, incense (among some), chanting, and vestments. Lutheran churches often celebrate the Eucharist each Sunday, if not at every worship service. This aligns with Luther's preference and the Lutheran confessions. Also, eucharistic ministers take the sacramental elements to the sick in hospitals and nursing homes. The practice of weekly Communion is increasingly the norm again in most Lutheran parishes throughout the world. The bishops and pastors of the larger Lutheran bodies have strongly encouraged this restoration of the weekly Mass. The celebration of the Eucharist may form a part of services for weddings, funerals, retreats, the dedication of a church building and annual synod conventions. The Mass is also an important aspect of ordinations and confirmations in Lutheran churches. Methodism A Methodist minister consecrating the Eucharist elements during the Service of the Word and Table The celebration of the \\"Mass\\" in Methodist churches, commonly known as the Service of the Table, is based on The Sunday Service of 1784, a revision of the liturgy of the 1662 Book of Common Prayer authorized by John Wesley.. The use of the term \\"Mass\\" is very rare in Methodism. The terms \\"Holy Communion\\", \\"Lord's Supper\\", and to a lesser extent \\"Eucharist\\" are far more typical. The celebrant of a Methodist Eucharist must be an ordained or licensed minister. In the Free Methodist Church, the liturgy of the Eucharist, as provided in its Book of Discipline, is outlined as follows: *The Invitation: You who truly and earnestly repent of your sins, who live in love and peace with your neighbors and who intend to lead a new life, following the commandments of God and walking in His holy ways, draw near with faith, and take this holy sacrament to your comfort; and humbly kneeling, make your honest confession to Almighty God. *General Confession *Lord's Prayer *Affirmation of Faith *Collect *Sanctus Gloria Patri *Prayer of Humble Access *Prayer of Consecration of the Elements *Benediction Methodist services of worship, post-1992, reflect the ecumenical movement and Liturgical Movement, particularly the Methodist Mass, largely the work of theologian Donald C. Lacy.  Calendrical usage  The English suffix ' (equivalent to modern English \\"mass\\") can label certain prominent (originally religious) feasts or seasons based on a traditional liturgical year, for example: * Candlemas * Childermas * Christmas * Johnmas * Lammas * Martinmas * Michelmas See also *Black Mass *Blue Mass *Chantry *Eucharistic theologies contrasted *Gnostic Mass *Gold Mass *Liturgical reforms of Pope Pius XII *Mass (music) * Mass in the Catholic Church *Mass of Paul VI *Pontifical High Mass *Red Mass *Redemptionis Sacramentum *Requiem Mass *Roman Missal *Sacraments of the Catholic Church *White Mass References Bibliography * Further reading *Balzaretti, C., (2000).

(See the \\"Lists Consulted\\" section for full details.) The composers run from Jacopo Peri, who wrote the first ever opera in late 16th century Italy, to John Adams, one of the leading figures in the contemporary operatic world. The brief accompanying notes offer an explanation as to why each composer has been considered major. Also included is a section about major women opera composers, compiled from the same lists. For an introduction to operatic history, see opera. The organisation of the list is by birthdate.  Major opera composers   1550‚Äì1699  Jacopo Peri as Arion in La pellegrina * Jacopo Peri (1561‚Äì1633). A Florentine who composed both the first opera ever, Dafne (1598), and the first surviving opera, Euridice (1600).Viking Opera Guide p. 768 * Claudio Monteverdi (1567‚Äì1643) is generally regarded as the first major opera composer.Orrey p. 18 In Orfeo (1607) he blended Peri's experiments in opera with the lavish spectacle of the intermedi.Professor Tim Carter in Viking Opera Guide (p. 678) writes: \\"Monteverdi's recitative owes much to Peri ... However \\"Orfeo\\" has much broader roots. There are many references to the tradition of the Florentine intermedi: the spectacular stage effects, the mythological subject matter, the allegorical figures, the number and scoring of the instruments and the extended choruses\\". See also Carter, writing about the intermedi in The Oxford Illustrated History of Opera (p. 4): \\"rich display and erudite symbolism made the intermedi an ideal projection of princely magnificence\\". Later, in Venice in the 1640s, he helped make opera a commercially viable form with Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria and L'incoronazione di Poppea, one of the earliest operas in the present-day operatic repertoire. * Francesco Cavalli (1602‚Äì1676). Amongst the most important of Monteverdi's successors, Cavalli was a major force in spreading opera throughout Italy and also helped introduce it to France. His Giasone was \\" the most popular opera of the 17th century\\".Viking Opera Guide p. 189 * Jean-Baptiste Lully (1632‚Äì1687). In close collaboration with the librettist Philippe Quinault, Lully founded the tradition of trag√©die en musique,Orrey p. 35 combining singing, dance and visual spectacle, which would remain the most prestigious French operatic genre for almost a hundred years. Cadmus et Hermione (1673) is often regarded as the first example of French opera. * Henry Purcell (1659‚Äì1695). Purcell was the first English operatic composer of significance. His masterwork is Dido and Aeneas.Orrey p. 55 * Alessandro Scarlatti (1660‚Äì1725). A key figure in the development of opera seria, Scarlatti claimed to have composed over 100 operas, of which La Griselda is a notable example.Viking Opera Guide p. 942 * Jean-Philippe Rameau (1683‚Äì1764) was the most important French opera composer of the 18th century. Following in the genre established by Lully,Orrey p. 40 he endowed his works with a great richness of invention. Rameau's musical daring provoked great controversy in his day, but he was an important influence on Gluck. * Johann Christoph Pepusch (1667‚Äì1752). Arranger of the first English ballad opera, the biting political satire, The Beggar's Opera.Viking Opera Guide p. 343 * George Frideric Handel (1685‚Äì1759). Handel's opera serie set the standard in his day.Orrey p. 59 Handel composed a series of over 30 operas.  1700‚Äì99  Gluck in a 1775 portrait by Joseph Duplessis. * Giovanni Battista Pergolesi (1710‚Äì1736). Though Pergolesi also composed opera serias, his most influential work was the short opera buffa, La serva padrona.Oxford Companion to Music, p. 783 * Christoph Willibald Gluck (1714‚Äì1787) was a key figure in the transformation of Baroque into Classical opera, paving the way for Mozart, though his influence stretched much further into the 19th century, with both Berlioz and Wagner acknowledging their debt to him. In his reform operas from Orfeo ed Euridice onwards, he sought to throw off the formal conventions of opera seria and write music of \\"beautiful simplicity\\" (his own words).Orrey p. 85 * Giovanni Paisiello (1740‚Äì1816). Italian composer who wrote the first opera to include Beaumarchais' character Figaro as a main character, as well as writing a substantial number of other operas, some of them in St. Petersburg. * Andr√© Ernest Modeste Gr√©try (1741‚Äì1813). Li√®ge (present day Belgian) composer crucial to the development of French op√©ra comique, whose simplicity of musical style and sophisticated dramaturgy were immensely popular, as well as linking pre-revolutionary rococo comedy to the later romantic style. * Domenico Cimarosa (1749‚Äì1801). Italian composer most famous for the opera buffa, Il matrimonio segreto, which forms a bridge between the comedies of Mozart and Rossini.Viking Opera Guide pp. 216‚Äì218 * Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756‚Äì1791). Mozart's series of comic collaborations (The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni, and Cos√¨ fan tutte) with Lorenzo da Ponte are among the most popular operas in the repertoire today,Orrey p. 101 along with his Singspiel The Magic Flute. *Antonio Salieri (1750‚Äì1825). Italian composer who was a major contributor to and shaper of Viennese musical life from 1770 to 1820, he also composed successful operas in Italy and Paris, and won admiration from German operagoers as a composer who, in the words of one contemporary critic, ‚Äòcould bind all the power of German music to the sweet Italian style‚Äô.JANE SCHATKIN HETTRICK, JOHN A. RICE 'Salieri, Antonio' in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. His opera Europa riconosciuta was composed for the inauguration of La Scala. Among his other most successful operas were Les Dana√Ødes, Axur, re d'Ormus (the Italian version of French Tarare) and Falstaff. * Luigi Cherubini (1760‚Äì1842). A follower of Gluck, Cherubini's most famous opera is M√©d√©e. The title role has proved a challenge to sopranos (including Maria Callas) since its premiere in 1797.Viking Opera Guide p. 210 * Ludwig van Beethoven (1770‚Äì1827) wrote only one opera, Fidelio, a tale of freedom from political oppression, which has become one of the major German language operas.Orrey p. 139 * Gaspare Spontini (1774‚Äì1851). Though Italian, Spontini is best known for his work in France during the Napoleonic era. His masterpiece La vestale influenced Bellini and Berlioz.Viking Opera Guide p. 1002 * Daniel-Fran√ßois-Esprit Auber (1782‚Äì1871). French composer celebrated for high-spirited op√©ra comiques such as Fra Diavolo and Le domino noir. His grand opera La muette de Portici attained unexpected political influence when a performance in Brussels in 1830 sparked off a revolution which led to the creation of Belgium.Viking Opera Guide pp. 37‚Äì38 * Carl Maria von Weber (1786‚Äì1826) founded German Romantic operaOrrey p. 140 in order to challenge the dominance of Italian bel canto. A master of orchestral colour and atmosphere, Weber was never well served by his librettists, and only one of his works, Der Freisch√ºtz, is performed with any frequency. Though he died young, his influence on later German composers, especially Wagner, was immense. * Giacomo Meyerbeer (1791‚Äì1864). The archetypal composer of French grand opera, Meyerbeer's huge extravaganzas such as Les Huguenots and Le proph√®te were immensely popular in their day.Oxford Illustrated History of Opera pp. 146‚Äì150 * Gioachino Rossini (1792‚Äì1868) links bel canto with Grand Opera. His immortal Barber of Seville was the only one of his operas that was continuously performed into the 20th century,Britannica p. 631 C.2 but his serious operas, such as Semiramide and Ermione, are recognised as masterpieces now that singers with appropriate technique are again available to perform them. Guillaume Tell, his swan-song, has a vast sweep only equalled in the 19th century by the later works of Verdi, Mussorgsky and Wagner. *Heinrich Marschner (1795‚Äì1861). German composer who was the most important exponent of German Romantic opera in the generation between Weber and Wagner.A. DEAN PALMER 'Marschner, Heinrich August' in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. His most successful operas were Hans Heiling, Der Vampyr and Der Templer und die J√ºdin. * Gaetano Donizetti (1797‚Äì1848). Along with Rossini and Bellini, Donizetti is generally acknowledged as one of the masters of the bel canto style. His masterwork is generally cited as being Lucia di Lammermoor.Orrey p. 134 * Jacques Fromental Hal√©vy (1799‚Äì1862). Along with Meyerbeer, the best known composer of French grand opera, Hal√©vy's key work is La Juive, a story of religious intolerance set in 15th century Switzerland.Viking Opera Guide p. 412  1800‚Äì49  Giuseppe Verdi, by Giovanni Boldini, 1886 (National Gallery of Modern Art, Rome) * Vincenzo Bellini (1801‚Äì1835). On account of such works as Norma and I puritani, Bellini is recognised as one of the leading composers of the bel canto style of opera.Orrey pp. 129‚Äì133 * Hector Berlioz (1803‚Äì1869). Berlioz's attempts to carve out an operatic career for himself were thwarted by an unimaginative musical establishment.Orrey p. 153 Nevertheless, he managed to produce Benvenuto Cellini, B√©atrice et B√©n√©dict and his masterpiece, the epic Les Troyens,.Orrey p. 154 Berlioz's dramatic legend, La Damnation de Faust, has also been staged as an opera in recent years. * Mikhail Glinka (1804‚Äì1857) founded the Russian operatic tradition with his historical drama A Life for the Tsar and his fairy tale piece Ruslan and Lyudmila.Orrey p. 180 * Ambroise Thomas (1811‚Äì1896). French composer noted for the operas Mignon and Hamlet.Viking Opera Guide p. 1098. * Richard Wagner (1813‚Äì1883). Wagner revolutionised opera. In a series of \\"music dramas\\" such as Tristan und Isolde, Parsifal, and most of all his epic tetralogy Der Ring des Nibelungen, Wagner abolished the traditional distinction between recitative and aria and pioneered a new through-composed style of opera.Orrey pp. 168‚Äì169 * Giuseppe Verdi (1813‚Äì1901) had a long composing career, during which his compositional style kept evolving. Among his most famous works are Rigoletto, Il Trovatore, La traviata, Don Carlos, Aida, and Otello.Orrey pp. 137‚Äì147 * Charles Gounod (1818‚Äì1893) wrote lyrical operas on literary themes, including Rom√©o et Juliette and Mireille. His Faust still holds the stage today, in spite of criticisms of its \\"Victorianism\\". * Jacques Offenbach (1819‚Äì1880) was the founder of French operetta and a prolific composer of pieces which achieved tremendous success with Parisian audiences for their catchy melodies and satirical bite such as La Vie parisienne and Orpheus in the Underworld.Britannica p. 633 C.1 At the time of his death, Offenbach was working on a more serious opera, The Tales of Hoffmann. * Bed≈ôich Smetana (1824‚Äì1884) established Czech national opera with such historical epics as Dalibor.Orrey p. 177 His folk comedy The Bartered Bride has entered the international repertory. * Aleksandr Borodin (1833‚Äì1887). A \\"weekend composer\\" who spent 17 years working on a single opera, Prince Igor, which now forms a key part of the Russian repertory.Viking Opera Guide p. 134 * Camille Saint- Sa√´ns (1835‚Äì1921). French composer of around a dozen operas of which one, the Biblical Samson et Delila, is still performed.Viking Opera Guide p. 929. Viking says Saint-Sa√´ns wrote 13 operas, including his part in an unfinished work by Guiraud and two op√©ra comiques. * L√©o Delibes (1836‚Äì1891). French composer, whose Lakm√© is notable for its Flower duet and as a vehicle for coloratura sopranos.Viking Opera Guide p. 253. * Georges Bizet (1838‚Äì1875). Bizet's masterwork Carmen is a staple of the repertoire of opera houses the world over. At the time of its premiere, the controversial plot scandalised both critics and the public.Orrey pp. 156‚Äì157 * Modest Mussorgsky (1839‚Äì1881). Mussorgsky completed only one opera, but Boris Godunov proved to be inspiration for generations of Russian composers on account of its uniquely nationalist character.Britannica p. 637 C.2 * Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1840‚Äì1893). Tchaikovsky's international fame as an opera composer mainly rests on two works, Eugene Onegin and The Queen of Spades.Orrey p. 182 Less interested in cultivating a uniquely Russian style than his contemporary Mussorgsky, Tchaikovsky also shows the influence of Mozart, bel canto and Bizet's Carmen in these pieces.David Brown (author of the four-volume Tchaikovsky: A Biographical and Critical Study, Gollancz, 1978‚Äì91) in Viking Opera Guide, pp. 1083‚Äì1095 * Emmanuel Chabrier (1841‚Äì1894) had ambitions to write grand operas in the Wagnerian vein, but is now most celebrated for lighter pieces, such as L'√©toile and Le roi malgr√© lui, which were greatly admired by Ravel and Poulenc.Viking Opera Guide p. 197 * Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k (1841‚Äì1904) was the leading Czech opera composer between Smetana and Jan√°ƒçek. His Rusalka, based on the Undine legend, is his most popular work internationally.Viking Opera Guide p. 302 * Jules Massenet (1842‚Äì1912). Arguably the most representative French opera composer of his era (the Belle √âpoque), Massenet was a prolific and versatile writer whose works cover a wide variety of themes.Orrey p. 156 His popularity faded somewhat after the First World War, but Werther and Manon still make regular appearances in the opera house.Graham Dixon in Viking Opera Guide, p. 622 * Arthur Sullivan (1842‚Äì1900). English composer who is best known for his series of 14 operatic collaborations with the dramatist W. S. Gilbert, including such enduring works as H.M.S. Pinafore, The Pirates of Penzance and The Mikado. * Nikolai Rimsky- Korsakov (1844‚Äì1908). Russian composer who wrote colourful operas on legendary and historical subjects.Viking Opera Guide p. 864  1850‚Äì99  Giacomo Puccini * Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek (1854‚Äì1928). Jan√°ƒçek's first mature opera (Jen≈Øfa) blended folksong-like melodies and an emphasis on natural speech-rhythms √† la Mussorgsky with a character-driven plot of some intensity;Britannica p. 638 C.2 his later works became increasingly terse, with recurrent melodic fragments, lyrical outbursts and unconventional orchestration serving a diverse collection of source-material ‚Äì just a few bars of these operas can instantly be identified as his. * Ruggiero Leoncavallo (1857‚Äì1919) Italian composer associated with verismo. His Pagliacci is a staple of the operatic repertoire and is usually given alongside Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana.Viking Opera Guide p. 563 * Giacomo Puccini (1858‚Äì1924). The only true successor to Giuseppe Verdi in Italian opera,Orrey p. 225 Puccini's Tosca, La Boh√®me and Madama Butterfly are among the most popular and well- recognised in the repertoire today. * Gustave Charpentier (1860‚Äì1956). French composer famous for a single opera, Louise, set in a working class district of Paris.Viking Opera Guide pp. 202‚Äì204 * Claude Debussy (1862‚Äì1918). Like Beethoven, Debussy finished only one opera, but his setting of Maeterlinck's Symbolist play Pell√©as et M√©lisande is a key work in 20th century music drama.Orrey p. 216 In many ways an \\"anti-opera\\", Pell√©as contained little of the conventional singing or action audiences at the premi√®re had come to expect, but Debussy used his subtle orchestration to create an elusive, dream- like atmosphere, which still has the power to fascinate (or repel) listeners today. * Pietro Mascagni (1863‚Äì1945). Italian composer, famous above all for Cavalleria rusticana, usually given in a double-bill with Leoncavallo's Pagliacci.Viking Opera Guide p. 617 * Richard Strauss (1864‚Äì1949). Strauss was one of very few opera composers in the early years of the 20th century to accept and conquer the challenge laid down by the scale and radical nature of Wagner's innovative works.Orrey p. 213 He composed several operas that remain extremely popular today, including Salome, Elektra, and Der Rosenkavalier. * Hans Pfitzner (1869‚Äì1949). A follower of Wagner, Pfitzner is best known for the opera Palestrina which explores the debate between tradition and innovation in music.Viking Opera Guide p. 772 * Arnold Schoenberg (1874‚Äì1951). A leading Modernist composer and the deviser of the twelve-tone system, Schoenberg began his operatic career with the Expressionist monodrama Erwartung. His major opera Moses und Aron was left unfinished at his death.Viking Opera Guide p. 952 * Maurice Ravel (1875‚Äì1937) wrote two short, but innovative, operas: L'enfant et les sortil√®ges, set in the world of childhood, and the Spanish-flavoured L'heure espagnole.Viking Opera Guide p. 848 * Franz Schreker (1878‚Äì1934). An Austrian composer associated with Expressionism, Schreker once rivalled Richard Strauss in popularity but, as a Jew, he fell foul of the Nazis. His operas include Der ferne Klang and Die Gezeichneten.Viking Opera Guide p. 958 * B√©la Bart√≥k (1881‚Äì1945) wrote only one opera, Duke Bluebeard's Castle, a key piece in 20th century music theatre and the only Hungarian work with a secure place in the international operatic repertoire.Viking Opera Guide p. 55 * Igor Stravinsky (1882‚Äì1971). After composing the Rimsky-Korsakov-inspired The Nightingale and the near-operas Renard and The Soldier's Tale, Stravinsky bucked 20th century trends by composing a \\"number\\" opera, The Rake's Progress, using diatonicism.Orrey p. 220 * Alban Berg (1885‚Äì1935). Because of their atonal music which uses tonal conventions harkening back to late romanticism and tragic libretti, Berg's masterworks Wozzeck and Lulu have stayed in the repertory and assumed increased popularity after his death. * Sergei Prokofiev (1891‚Äì1953). A major modern composer in the Russian tradition,Britannica p. 637 C.1 Prokofiev produced operas on a wide variety of subjects, from the comic fairy-tale The Love for Three Oranges, to the dark and occult The Fiery Angel and the epic War and Peace. Like Shostakovich, Prokofiev suffered under the Soviet artistic regime, but his work has recently been championed by conductors such as Valery Gergiev. * Paul Hindemith (1895‚Äì1963). A German composer who came to prominence in the years following World War I. His key opera Mathis der Maler, dealing with the problems of an artist in a time of crisis, has been seen as an allegory of Hindemith's situation during the Third Reich.Viking Opera Guide p. 467 * George Gershwin (1898‚Äì1937) owes his place in the standard operatic repertoire to Porgy and Bess.Viking Opera Guide p. 348  1900‚Äìpresent  * William Walton (1902‚Äì1983). Walton's major opera is Troilus and Cressida.Viking Opera Guide p. 1207 * Michael Tippett (1905‚Äì1998). Probably the most famous British composer to follow in the wake of Benjamin Britten, Tippett wrote operas exploring metaphysical and social themes. They include The Midsummer Marriage and The Knot Garden.Viking Opera Guide p. 1102 * Dmitri Shostakovich (1906‚Äì1975). Shostakovich's most famous opera, Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District, a violent love story set in provincial Russia, scandalised Soviet authorities. He later produced a revised version, Katerina Ismailova. Nevertheless, the original became one of the most performed operatic works of the 20th century.Orrey p. 232 * Samuel Barber (1910‚Äì1981). An American who composed two major operas, Vanessa and Antony and Cleopatra.Viking Opera Guide p. 51 * Gian Carlo Menotti (1911‚Äì2007). Italian American composer, particularly famous for the Christmas piece Amahl and the Night Visitors, the first opera to be written specifically for television.Viking Opera Guide p. 648 * Benjamin Britten (1913‚Äì1976). One of the handful of British opera composers to reach international acclaim, and one of the extremely few composers of 20th century operas that stayed in the standard repertory after their premieres. These operas include his masterworks Peter Grimes, A Midsummer Night's Dream, and The Turn of the Screw.Orrey p. 234 * Hans Werner Henze (1926‚Äì2012). One of the most widely performed post- World War II opera composers, Henze's works include The Bassarids and Elegy for Young Lovers.Viking Opera Guide p. 461 * Peter Maxwell Davies (1934‚Äì2016). A British modernist of the \\"Manchester school\\", Davies wrote many stage works, including Taverner and The Martyrdom of Saint Magnus.Viking Opera Guide p. 243 * Philip Glass (born 1937). A leading American composer of the minimalist school, Glass first came to fame with the opera Einstein on the Beach, a collaboration with the theatre director Robert Wilson. Many stage works (including Akhnaten and The Voyage) followed.Viking Opera Guide p. 360 * John Adams (born 1947). Like Glass, Adams started as a minimalist. His operas dealing with contemporary subjects, Nixon in China and The Death of Klinghoffer, have gained critical acclaim and provoked political controversy.Viking Opera Guide p. 17  Female opera composers  John Singer Sargent drawing of Ethel Smyth, 1901 A number of reasons, including the high cost of production and high status of opera,See, e.g. Katherine Kolb's review of Women Writing Opera: Creativity and Controversy in the Age of the French Revolution. have been suggested to explain the relatively few women who have been composers of opera, and no woman composer met the criteria for inclusion above. However, some experts in our sample disagreed,See #Lists consulted and named either or both of the women below as comparable to those already listed: * Francesca Caccini (18 September 1587 ‚Äì after 1641) was an Italian composer, singer, lutenist, poet, and music teacher of the early Baroque era. She was also known by the nickname \\"La Cecchina\\", given to her by the Florentines and probably a diminutive of \\"Francesca\\".Alexander and Savino (1997) p. 20 She was the daughter of Giulio Caccini.

It narrates the tragedy of a large passenger spacecraft carrying a cargo of colonists escaping destruction on Earth veering off course, leaving the Solar System and entering into an existential struggle. The style is symbolic, sweeping and innovative for its time, with creative use of neologisms to suggest the science fictional setting. It was published in its final form on 13October 1956. Aniara was adapted into a Swedish feature film in 2018. Title In a 1997 Swedish edition of Aniara literary scholar writes that the neologism Aniara is Harry Martinson's own invention.Harry Martinson Aniara, Albert Bonniers f√∂rlag 1997 Martinson came up with the word years before writing the work while reading astronomer Arthur Eddington, then giving it the meaning as the \\"name for the space in which the atoms moves\\".TOMAS BANNERHED: Hur kunde det g√• s√• snett? Expressen 22 November 2019 (in Swedish) A preface to a 2005 Italian edition claims that the title comes from ancient Greek ·ºÄŒΩŒπŒ±œÅœåœÇ, \\"sad, despairing\\",. plus special resonances that the sound \\"a\\" had for Martinson.Preface to , the Italian edition of Aniara. Another theory makes up the word \\"Aniara\\" from the chemical symbols Ni (Nickel) and Ar (Argon) and the negative prefix \\"a-\\", and interprets this as the ship being untethered to both earth (Nickel being abundant in the Earth's core) and sky (Argon being abundant in the Earth's atmosphere). Martinson himself is said (by Tord Hall, longtime friend) to have been fond of this interpretation.https://fof.se/tidning/2019/2/artikel/jag-har-alltid-varit- lockad-av-att-ga-nara-stup (in Swedish)http://www.alvin- portal.org/alvin/view.jsf?pid=alvin-record%3A10437&dswid;=-5346 Interpretation According to Aadu Ott and Lars Broman at the International Planetarium Society, Aniara is an effort to \\"[mediate] between science and poetry, between the wish to understand and the difficulty to comprehend\\". Martinson translates scientific imagery into the poem: for example, the \\"curved space\\" from Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity is likely an inspiration for Martinson's description of the cosmos as \\"a bowl of glass\\", according to the Nobel Prize Foundation.From Nobel Lectures, Literature 1968-1980, Editor-in-Charge Tore Fr√§ngsmyr, Editor Sture All√©n, World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore, 1993 Martinson also said he was influenced by Paul Dirac. The poem  The poem consists of 103 cantos, each relating the tragedy of a large passenger spacecraft originally bound for Mars with a cargo of colonists from the ravaged Earth. After an accident, the ship is ejected from the Solar System and into an existential struggle. The style is symbolic, sweeping and innovative for its time, with creative use of neologisms to suggest the science fictional setting. The first 29 cantos of Aniara had previously been published in Martinson's collection Cikada (1953), under the title S√•ngen om Doris och Mima (The Song of Doris and Mima), relating the departure from Earth, the accidental near-collision with an asteroid (incidentally named Hondo, another name for the main Japanese isle where Hiroshima is situated) and ejection from the solar system, the first few years of increasing despair and distractions of the passengers, until news is received of the destruction of their home port, and perhaps of Earth itself. According to Martinson, he dictated the initial cycle as in a fever after a troubling dream, affected by the Cold War and the Soviet suppression of the 1956 Hungarian revolution; in another recounting, he said the first 29 cantos were said to be inspired by his observation of the Andromeda Galaxy. A major theme is that of art, symbolised by the semi-mystical machinery of the Mima, who relieves the ennui of crew and passengers with scenes of far-off times and places, and whose operator is also the sometimes na√Øve main narrator. The rooms of Mima, according to Martinson, represent different kinds of life styles or forms of consciousness. The accumulated destruction the Mima witnesses impels her to destroy herself in despair, to which she, the machine, is finally moved by the white tears of the granite melted by the phototurb which annihilates their home port, the great city of Dorisburg. Without the succour of the Mima, the erstwhile colonists seek distraction in sensual orgies, memories of their own and earlier lives, low comedy, religious cults, observations of strange astronomical phenomena, empty entertainments, science, routine tasks, brutal totalitarianism, and in all kinds of human endeavour, but ultimately cannot face the emptiness outside and inside. The poems are metrical and mostly rhymed, using both traditional and individual forms, several alluding to a wide range of Swedish and Nordic poetry, such as the Finnish Kalevala.  Translations  Aniara was translated into English as Aniara, A Review of Man in Time and Space by Hugh MacDiarmid and E. Harley Schubert in 1963. It was translated again into English by Stephen Klass and Leif Sj√∂berg for a 1999 edition. Neither edition is in print.  Reviews  Geoffrey O'Brien, writing for the New York Review of Books, compares the two editions and finds the recent Klass Sj√∂berg edition more faithful to \\"Martinson's formal schemes\\" while considering the MacDiarmid Schubert edition \\"more persuasive\\" as English poetry.\\"There‚Äôs No Place Like Home \\", Geoffrey O'Brien, The New York Review of Books, Aug 15 2019https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/08/15/aniara-no-place-like-home/ Burns Singer wrote of the original translation \\"it may well prove a seminal volume in the history of English letters\\" in Times Literary Supplement.  Reception  The well-known American science fiction writer, Theodore Sturgeon, in reviewing a 1964 American edition for a genre audience, stated that \\"Martinson's achievement here is an inexpressible, immeasurable sadness. [It] [t]ranscends panic and terror and even despair [and] leaves you in the quiet immensities, with the feeling that you have spent time, and have been permanently tinted, by and with an impersonal larger-than-God force.\\" Writing a guest review for The New York Times, D. Bruce Lockerbie suggested that with Aniara Martinson had, along with C. S. Lewis, \\"found that an interplanetary setting, light years removed from mundanity\\" supplied \\"the esthetic distance necessary for truly profound thought.\\"\\"The Trip of Aniara\\", By D. Bruce Lockerbie, The Times, November 10, 1974, Page 453https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/10/archives/the-guest-word-the-trip-of- aniara.html The poem has also been reviewed more recently. In a 2015 review James Nicoll writes \\"Martinson‚Äôs creative approach to astronomy and related matters gives the work an misleadingly archaic feel.\\"https://jamesdavisnicoll.com/review/good-not-to-be-always-mindful-of- our-torpid-transmigration M. A. Orthofer finds in 2018 the poem \\"a product of its times, but even as aspects may no longer seems as current, it holds up well in its bleak vision.\\"http://www.complete- review.com/reviews/sverige/martinsonh.htm In his 2019 overview of Martinson's works in the New York Review of Books, Geoffrey O'Brien concludes \\"Aniara is an epic of extinction, conceived at a moment when extinction had begun to seem not only possible but perhaps imminent.\\"  Legacy  Aniara has had an influence on later works of science fiction, such as Tau Zero by American writer Poul Andersen.Algis Budrys, \\"Galaxy Bookshelf\\" in Galaxy Science Fiction, December 1970, pp. 93-95; 191-192 AT p. 192 In its 2004 centennial celebration the Harry Martinson Society characterized Aniara as an \\"epic poem about the spaceship in which we flee the destruction of the earth, the spaceship that drifts off course into an endless universe\\", and considered the poem to have achieved becoming a legend in their own right, one of the myths people are familiar with without necessarily knowing who created them.http://harrymartinson.se/in-english/ In December 2019 the extrasolar planet HD 102956 b was named after a character aboard the spacecraft, the pilot Isagel, as part of the IAU NameExoWorlds project.

The music was composed by Karl-Birger Blomdahl. The BBC Third Programme broadcast an Engish translation, read over five nights, in November 1962. In Martinsons home country of Sweden, Aniara has commonly been used as the basis of planetarium shows, the first one set up in 1988 by Bj√∂rn Stenholm using music by Dmitrij Shostakovich in the planetarium then housed in what is now the Old Observatory in Lund, Sweden. An English-language show premiered during the International Planetarium Society conference in Salt Lake City, Utah in 1992.https://www.ips-planetarium.org/page/a_ottandbroman1988 Tommy K√∂rberg headlined 31 songs from Aniara, a stage concert first set up in Olofstr√∂m, Sweden in 1997.http://dominiquemusik.se/sv/31-sanger-fran-aniara/ The fourth album from the Swedish progressive metal band Seventh Wonder called The Great Escape (2010) is based on Aniara, the title track last 30:21 minutes and relates all the poem from beginning to end.

This s≈´tra recounts a teaching primarily between Gautama Buddha and a bodhisattva named MahƒÅmati, \\"Great Wisdom\\". The s≈´tra is set in La·πÖkƒÅ, the island fortress capital of RƒÅva·πáa, the king of the rƒÅk·π£asa demons. The title of this text roughly translates as \\"Scripture of the Descent into La·πÖkƒÅ\\". The La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra figured prominently in the development of Chinese, Tibetan and Japanese Buddhism. It is notably an important s≈´tra in Chan Buddhism and Japanese Zen. S≈´tra doctrine The La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra draws upon the concepts and doctrines of YogƒÅcƒÅra and Buddha-nature.Youru Wang, Linguistic Strategies in Daoist Zhuangzi and Chan Buddhism: The Other Way of Speaking. Routledge, 2003, page 58. The most important doctrine issuing from the La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra is that of the primacy of consciousness (Skt. ƒÅlayavij√±ƒÅna) and the teaching of consciousness as the only reality. In the s≈´tra, the Buddha asserts that all the objects of the world, and the names and forms of experience, are manifestations of the mind: Because the world is seen as being \\"mind-only\\" or \\"consciousness-only\\", all phenomena are void, empty of self (atman) and illusory: The La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra describes the various tiers of consciousness in the individual, culminating in the tathƒÅgatagarbha \\"buddha-womb\\" (i.e., buddha-nature) or \\"storehouse consciousness\\" (Skt. ƒÄlayavij√±ƒÅna), which is the base of the individual's deepest awareness and his tie to the cosmic. However, the Buddha makes clear that the Buddha-nature is not a self (atman) and is empty of self-nature. He states that it is merely a useful means (upaya) of teaching the dharma to others: The tathƒÅgatagarbha or \\"Buddha-nature\\" doctrine has been interpreted as an expression of the doctrines of pratƒ´tyasamutpƒÅda \\"dependent origination\\" and emptiness. While seemingly monistic in nature, describing the tathagatagarbha as eternal (nitya) and immutable (atman), this doctrine is ultimately based on emptiness. According to Japanese scholar Yamaguchi Susumu, the most important point in the tathagatagarbha literature is that \\"the pratitysamutpada is the tathagatagarbha.\\"Heng-Ching Shih, The Significance Of 'Tathagatagarbha' -- A Positive Expression Of 'Sunyata' Likewise, Ichijo Ogawa argues that tathƒÅgatagarbha is basically equivalent to emptiness and the nature of the mind which allows it to understand emptiness. This interpretation is based on a passage from the RatnagotravibhƒÅga, which states that \\"all sentient beings are possessed of the tathƒÅgatagarbha\\". History and editions According to Asanga Tillekharatna, \\"it is generally believed that the sutra was compiled during 350-400 CE,\\" although \\"many who have studied the sutra are of opinion that the introductory chapter and the last two chapters were added to the book at a later period.\\"Asanga Tillekharatna, La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra. Encyclopedia of Buddhism Vol 6. ed. G. P. Malalasekara et al. (Colombo 1999) But Christian Lindtner shows that some early recension of Lankavatara sutra was known to and influenced the writings of Nagarjuna and Aryadeva basing his conclusion on several close or literal allusions to the sutra in early madhyamaka texts.Lindtner, Christian (1992). The Lankavatarasutra in Early Indian Madhyamaka Literature, Copenhagen. Asiatische Studien, XLV, 1, pp. 244‚Äì279.PƒÅsƒÅdika, B. (1988). The Indian Origins of the Lam-rim Literature of Central Asia. The Tibet Journal, 13(1), 3-11. Four translations of the La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra were made from Sanskrit into the Chinese language between roughly 420 CE and 704, the earliest being attributed to Dharmarak·π£a in the 5th Century. Of these, only three are now extant. The first extant Chinese translation is Taish≈ç Tripi·π≠aka 670 (Ê•û‰ºΩÈòøË∑ãÂ§öÁæÖÂØ∂Á∂ì). This is the earliest edition which was translated by Gu·πáabhadra in 443 CE, and divided into four fascicles.Nanjio 1923, pp. VIII‚ÄìIX This edition by Gu·πáabhadra is said to be the one handed down from the founder of Chan Buddhism, Bodhidharma, to the Second Patriarch, Dazu Huike, saying: The second extant Chinese translation is Taish≈ç Tripi·π≠aka 671 (ÂÖ•Ê•û‰ºΩÁ∂ì). This second edition was translated by Bodhiruci in 513 CE, and divided into ten fascicles. This edition is criticized in the imperial preface to the later translation, which says that it contains extra words and sentences mixed in that detract from the original meaning. The third extant Chinese translation is Taish≈ç Tripi·π≠aka 672 (Â§ß‰πòÂÖ•Ê•û‰ºΩÁ∂ì). This third edition was translated by ≈öik·π£ƒÅnanda in 700-704 CE, and divided into seven fascicles. This final translation was made at the behest of Empress Wu Zetian, after ≈öik·π£ƒÅnanda had completed his 80-fascicle translation of the '. This translation is said to have employed five separate Sanskrit editions for accuracy. Before the final edits to this version had been made, ≈öik·π£ƒÅnanda returned to India, and another Indian monk came to China who had studied the Buddhist sutras for 25 years in India, and who knew the La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra. He was then given the task of revising the translation made by ≈öik·π£ƒÅnanda. In addition to these Chinese translations, there are also two Tibetan translations, and a version of the Sanskrit was preserved in Nepal. One Tibetan translation is derived from the Sanskrit original, and the other is likely a translation of Gu·πáabhadra's Chinese into Tibetan. Nanjo Bunyu prepared a critical edition of the Sanskrit in 1923 based on four manuscripts from the Nepalese recension, among other sources.B. Nanjio (ed.): The La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra, Kyoto, Otani University Press 1923 (in NƒÅgarƒ´) The earliest translations of the La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra are significantly shorter than later ones, which D.T. Suzuki interprets as suggesting that additions were made to the text over time. The first and last chapters (which connect the text with Ravana, the villain of the Ramayana, and adds a dharani) are missing from the earliest translation, and the prose of the first chapter in later translations does not agree with the verse-form provided alongside it. Suzuki also suggests that the chapter on meat eating, where the Theravada 'thrice clean' practice is criticized, may be a later edition based on its different tone and content from the rest of the text. Based on the text's lack of organization, varying and sometimes irrelevant chapter headings, and expansion over time, Suzuki suggests that it may have originated as a collection of individual passages summarizing essential Mahayana doctrines, which were later shaped into a narrative.

A two-time Grammy Award‚Äìwinner known for his distinctive bass-baritone voice and romantic image, his greatest success came in the 1970s as a solo singer and with The Love Unlimited Orchestra, crafting many enduring soul, funk, and disco songs such as his two biggest hits: \\"You're the First, the Last, My Everything\\" and \\"Can't Get Enough of Your Love, Babe\\". During the course of his career in the music business, White achieved 112 gold albums worldwide, 41 of which also attained platinum status. White had 20 gold and 10 platinum singles, with worldwide record sales in excess of 100 million records, and is one of the best-selling music artists of all time. His influences included James Cleveland, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Elvis Presley, The Supremes, The Four Tops, and Marvin Gaye. Early life White was born Barry Eugene Carter on September 12, 1944, in Galveston, Texas, United States. His father was Melvin A. White, and his mother was Sadie Marie Carter. His parents never married, so his mother gave him her last name, but he later took on the surname of his father. He grew up in South Central Los Angeles, California. He was the older of two children; his brother Darryl was 13 months younger. White grew up listening to his mother's classical music collection and first took to the piano, emulating what he heard on the records. White has often been credited with playing piano, at age 11, on Jesse Belvin's 1956 hit single, \\"Goodnight My Love\\".Bobby Bennett and Sarah Smith, The Ultimate Soul Music Trivia Book: 501 Questions and Answers about Motown, Rhythm & Blues, and More, Secaucus, NJ: Carol Pub.

He believed the story was an exaggeration by journalists. While White and Belvin lived in the same neighborhood, Belvin was 12 years older than White. White's voice deepened suddenly when he was 14. He recalled: \\"[As a child], I had a normal squeaky kid voice. Then as a teenager, that completely changed. My mother cried because she knew her baby boy had become a man.\\" White's brother Darryl was murdered in a clash with a rival gang in 1983,\\"Singer Barry White dies at 58\\" - The Seattle Times, July 4, 2003 and White himself was jailed for four months at the age of 16 for stealing $30,000 worth of Cadillac tires. While in jail, he listened to Elvis Presley singing \\"It's Now or Never\\" on the radio, an experience he later credited with changing the course of his life.Barry White with Marc Eliot, Love Unlimited, New York: Broadway Books, 1999, p. 22. Music career 1960s After his release from jail, White left gang life and began a musical career at the beginning of the 1960s in singing groups. He first released \\"Too Far to Turn Around\\" in 1960 as part of The Upfronts before working for various small independent labels in Los Angeles. He also recorded several singles under his own name in the early 1960s, backed by vocal groups the Atlantics (for the Rampart and Faro labels) and the Majestics (for the Linda and Jordan labels).

Bob Keane of Del-Fi Records hired him as an A&R; man in the mid-1960s, and White started working with the label's artists, including Viola Wills and The Bobby Fuller Four, as a songwriter, session musician, and arranger. He discovered singer Felice Taylor and arranged her song \\"I Feel Love Comin' On\\" co-written with his friend Paul Politi. It became a big hit in the UK. Other charting hits written by White and Politi for her included \\"It May Be Winter Outside (But in My Heart It's Spring)\\" and \\"Under the Influence of Love\\".

In 1969, White was signed by Forward Records of Los Angeles, a division of Transcontinental Entertainment Corporation, as a producer. 1970s as producer In 1972, White got his big break producing a girl group he had discovered called Love Unlimited. Formed in imitative style of the Motown girl group The Supremes, the group members had gradually honed their talents with White for two years previously until they signed contracts with Uni Records. His friend Paul Politi hooked him up with music industry businessman Larry Nunes, who helped to finance their album. After it was recorded, Nunes took the recording to Russ Regan, who was the head of the Uni label owned by MCA. The album, 1972's From A Girl's Point of View We Give to You... Love Unlimited, became the first of White's string of long-titled albums and singles. White produced, wrote and arranged their classic soul ballad \\"Walkin' in the Rain with the One I Love\\", which climbed to No. 14 in the Billboard Hot 100 Pop chart and No. 6 on the Billboard R&B; chart in late 1972. It became White's first million selling single as a writer and producer. This single also reached No. 12 in the UK chart. White's voice can clearly be heard in this piece as he plays the lover who answers the phone call of the female lead. Soon after, Regan left Uni for 20th Century Records. Without Regan, White's relationship with Uni soured. With his relationship with Uni over and Love Unlimited contract-bound with the label, White was able to switch both his production deal and the group to 20th Century Records. They recorded several other hits throughout the 1970s, \\"I Belong to You\\", which spent over five months on the Billboard R&B; chart in 1974 including a week at No. 1 and \\"Under the Influence of Love Unlimited\\", which hit No. 3 on the Billboard Pop album charts. White married the lead singer of the group, Glodean James, on July 4, 1974. The Love Unlimited Orchestra In 1973, White created The Love Unlimited Orchestra, a 40-piece orchestral group to be used originally as a backing band for the girl-group Love Unlimited. However, White had other plans, and in 1973 he released a single with \\"Love's Theme\\" (written by him and played by the Orchestra). That same track reached No. 1 on the Billboard Pop charts. Later, in 1974, he made the first album of the Love Unlimited Orchestra, Rhapsody in White, containing \\"Love's Theme\\". White is sometimes credited with ushering in the \\"disco\\" sound, seamlessly combining R&B; music with classical music. Some also regard \\"Love's Theme\\" as the first hit in the actual \\"disco era\\". White would continue to make albums with the Orchestra, achieving some successes such as: \\"Rhapsody in White\\"; \\"Satin Soul\\"; \\"Forever in Love\\"; \\"Midnight Groove\\"; \\"My Sweet Summer Suite\\", Remake of \\"Theme From King Kong\\". The Orchestra ceased to make albums in 1983, but continued to support White as a backing band. 1970s solo career White wanted to work with another act but decided to work with a solo male artist. While working on a few demos for a male singer, he made three song demos of himself singing and playing, but Nunes heard them and insisted that he re-record and release them himself as a solo recording artist. After arguing for days about it, White was finally persuaded to release the songs himself, although he was initially reluctant to step out behind the microphone. He then wrote several other songs and recorded them for what eventually became an entire album of music. He was going to use the name \\"White Heat,\\" but decided on using his given name instead. White was still hesitating up to the time the label copy was made. It eventually became White's first solo album, 1973's I've Got So Much to Give. It included the title track and his first solo chart hit, \\"I'm Gonna Love You Just a Little More Baby\\", which also rose to No. 1 on the Billboard R&B; charts as well as No. 3 on the Billboard Pop charts in 1973 and stayed in the top 40 for many weeks. Other chart hits by White included \\"Never, Never Gonna Give You Up\\" (No. 2 R&B;, No. 7 Pop in 1973), \\"Can't Get Enough of Your Love, Babe\\" (No. 1 Pop and R&B; in 1974), \\"You're the First, the Last, My Everything\\" (No. 1 R&B;, No. 2 Pop in 1974), \\"What Am I Gonna Do with You\\" (No. 1 R&B;, No. 8 Pop in 1975), \\"Let the Music Play\\" (No. 4 R&B; in 1976), \\"It's Ecstasy When You Lay Down Next to Me\\" (No. 1 R&B;, No. 4 Pop in 1977) and \\"Your Sweetness Is My Weakness\\" (No. 2 R&B; in 1978) and others. White also had a strong following in the UK, where he scored five Top 10 hits and a No. 1 for \\"You're the First, the Last, My Everything\\". After six years White left 20th Century in 1979 to launch his own label, Unlimited Gold, with CBS/Columbia Records. 1980s Although his success on the pop charts slowed down as the disco era came to an end, he maintained a loyal following throughout his career. Despite several albums over the next three years, he failed to repeat his earlier successes, with no singles managing to reach the Billboard Hot 100, except for 1982's \\"Change,\\" climbing into the Billboard R&B; Top 20 (No. 12). His label venture was exacting a heavy financial cost on White, so he concentrated on mostly touring and finally folded his label in 1983. After four years he signed with A&M; Records, and with the release of 1987's The Right Night & Barry White, the single entitled \\"Sho' You Right\\" made it to the Billboard R&B; charts, peaking at No. 17. In 1989 he released The Man Is Back! and with it had three top 40 singles on the Billboard R&B; charts: \\"Super Lover\\", which made it to No. 34, \\"I Wanna Do It Good to Ya\\", which made it to No. 26, and \\"When Will I See You Again\\", which made it to No. 32. 1990s A 1970s nostalgia fad allowed White to enjoy a renewed wave of popularity in the 1990s. After participating in the song \\"The Secret Garden (Sweet Seduction Suite)\\" from Quincy Jones's 1989 album Back on the Block, White mounted an effective comeback with several albums, each more successful than the last. He returned to the top of the charts in 1991 with the album Put Me in Your Mix, which reached No. 8 on the Billboard R&B; Albums chart and the song by the same name reached No. 2 on the Billboard R&B; singles chart. In 1994, White released The Icon Is Love, which went to No. 1 on the Billboard R&B; album charts, and the single \\"Practice What You Preach\\" gave him his first No. 1 on the Billboard R&B; singles chart in almost 20 years. The album was nominated for a Grammy in the Best R&B; Album category, but lost to TLC's CrazySexyCool. In 1996, White recorded the duet \\"In Your Wildest Dreams\\" with Tina Turner. 1996 also saw the release of Space Jam and its soundtrack, on which White had a duet with Chris Rock, called \\"Basketball Jones,\\" a remake of Cheech & Chong's \\"Basketball Jones\\" from 1973. White's final album, 1999's Staying Power, resulted in his last hit song \\"Staying Power,\\" which placed No. 45 on the Billboard R&B; charts. The single won him two Grammy Awards in the categories Best Male R&B; Vocal Performance and Best Traditional R&B; Vocal Performance. His autobiography, Love Unlimited, written with Mark Eliot, was published in 1999 by Broadway Books. Acting career Over the course of his career, White sometimes did voice-over work for television and movies. He voiced the character Brother Bear in the film Coonskin (1975), and also played the character Sampson in the movie's live-action segments. White appeared as himself in a few episodes of The Simpsons. In the episode \\"Whacking Day\\", Bart and Lisa used his famous deep bass singing voice, played through loudspeakers placed on the ground, to lull and attract snakes, saving them from extermination. White was a fan of the show, and had reportedly contacted the staff about wanting to make a guest appearance. He made a second cameo in the episode \\"Krusty Gets Kancelled\\". White played the role of a bus driver for a Prodigy commercial in 1995, and he also portrayed the voice of a rabbit in a Good Seasons salad-dressing-mix commercial, singing a song called \\"You Can't Bottle Love\\". In addition, he did some work for car commercials, most famously for Oldsmobile, and later on, Jeep. White also provided voice-over for Arby's Restaurant commercials on television and radio to promote its Market Fresh menu. White's voice can also be heard in Apple's first iBook commercial. White made three guest appearances on the comedy-drama television series Ally McBeal, as his music was often featured on the show in dream sequences.  Personal life   Marriages  White was first married to his childhood sweetheart, identified as just Mary in his autobiography, by the time he was 19. They separated in 1969 and later divorced. In 1974, White married singer Glodean James. The couple collaborated on the 1981 album Barry & Glodean. They reportedly divorced in 1988, however, they were still legally married until White's death in 2003 although they lived separate lives. Although estranged from Glodean for over a decade, as his widow she was made sole executor of his estate.  Children  White had at least nine children. By the age of 16, White had fathered two children with his first wife Mary. They had four children together. In 2017, his son Darryl White from his first marriage sued his estate claiming he was cut off financially. White had four children with his second wife Glodean James. Their daughter Shaherah was his personal assistant. Barry Jr. played in the Love Unlimited Orchestra and was also his tour manager. White's son MacKevin worked in his publishing administration. White had a daughter, Denise Donnell born in 1962 to Gurtha Allen. She did not discover who her biological father was until 1988. She was accepted by White and with his help she changed her name to Denise White. In 2016, she sued White's estate after she stopped receiving money. After White's death in 2003, his girlfriend Katherine Denton claimed her infant daughter was his biological child. Denton also claimed that she was owed money and personal items that White had promised to give her. Paternity tests revealed that he was not the father of her child and Denton subsequently lost her court case. Health problems and death White was overweight for most of his adult life and suffered from related health problems. In October 1995, White was admitted to a hospital as a result of high blood pressure. In August 1999, White was forced to cancel a month's worth of tour dates owing to exhaustion, high blood pressure and a hectic schedule. In September 2002, White was hospitalized with kidney failure attributed to chronic diabetes mellitus and high blood pressure. While undergoing dialysis and awaiting a kidney transplant in May 2003, White suffered a severe stroke, which forced him to retire from public life. On July 4, 2003, White died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles at the age of 58.\\"Singer Barry White dies\\", BBC, July 5, 2003. His remains were cremated, and the ashes were scattered in the ocean off the Californian coast. Legacy On September 20, 2004, White was posthumously inducted into the Dance Music Hall of Fame at a ceremony held in New York. On September 12, 2013, which would have been White's 69th birthday, he was posthumously awarded the 2,506th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6914 Hollywood Boulevard in the category of recording.Andrew Barker, \\"Barry White to Receive Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame\\", Variety, September 12, 2013.

He is best known for his series of novels about the assassin Vlad Taltos, one of a disdained minority group of humans living on a world called Dragaera. His recent novels also include The Incrementalists (2013) and its sequel The Skill of Our Hands (2017), with co- author Skyler White. As a drummer and singer-songwriter, Brust has recorded one solo album and two albums as a member of Cats Laughing. Brust also co- wrote songs on two albums recorded in the mid-1990s by the band Boiled in Lead. Writing career The Dragaeran books The Vlad Taltos series, written as high fantasy with a science fiction underpinning, is set on a planet called Dragaera. The events of the series take place in an Empire mostly inhabited and ruled by the Dragaerans, a genetically engineered humanoid species, having characteristics such as greatly extended lifespans and heights averaging about seven feet. Referred to as \\"elfs\\" by some humans, they refer to themselves as \\"human.\\" The Dragaeran Empire controls a region that is \\"enclouded\\" by a perpetual overcast that blocks the sun from view. Vlad Taltos is one of the human minority (known by Dragaerans as \\"Easterners\\"), which exists as a lower class in the Empire. Vlad also practices the human art of witchcraft; \\"t√°ltos\\" is Hungarian for a kind of supernatural person in folklore. Though human, he is a citizen of the Empire because his social-climbing father bought a title in one of the less reputable of the 17 Dragaeran Great Houses. The only Great House that sells memberships this way is, not coincidentally, also the one that maintains a criminal organization. Vlad proves surprisingly successful in this organization. Despite being a human and a criminal, he has a number of high-ranking Dragaeran friends, and often gets caught up in important events. Brust has written 15 published novels in the series, which is proposed to run to nineteen novels ‚Äì one named for each of the Great Houses, one named for Vlad himself (Taltos), and a final novel which Brust has said will be titled The Final Contract. The first three novels resemble private-eye detective stories, perhaps the closest being Robert B. Parker's Spenser series. The later novels are more varied than the first three. Though they read like fantasy, there are science-fictional explanations for some things. Brust has also written another series set in Dragaera, the Khaavren Romances, set centuries before Vlad's time. Since Dragaerans live for thousands of years, many characters appear in both series. It is partly an homage to Alexandre Dumas p√®re's novels about the Three Musketeers, and is five volumes long, following the pattern of Dumas' series. The books are presented as historical novels written by Paarfi of Roundwood, a Dragaeran roughly contemporary with Vlad. Paarfi's old-fashioned, elaborate, and highly verbose writing is explicitly based on Dumas', though with a dialogue style that is, at times, based on Tom Stoppard's wordgames in Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead (according to Pamela Dean's introduction to Five Hundred Years After). The Baron of Magister Valley, an additional Paarfi novel, is modeled after Dumas's The Count of Monte Cristo. The two series are finally brought together in the thirteenth novel in the Vlad series, Tiassa, which can also be viewed as the sixth novel in the Khaavren series. Tiassa comprises what are in effect three related novellas, each told in a different style and connected by a common theme. The first section reads like the first three novels in the series, with a first-person narration by Vlad but including Khaavren's son, Piro; the second section has a different viewpoint character in each of its chapters; and the third section is narrated by Paarfi in the style of the earlier Khaavren Romances, with Khaavren as the viewpoint character and interacting with Vlad. Short stories Most of Brust's short stories are set in shared universes. These include Emma Bull's and Will Shetterly's Liavek, Robert Asprin's Thieves' World, Neil Gaiman's Sandman and Terri Windling's Borderland Series. Style and literary theory Brust was a founding member of a Minnesota-based writers' group called The Scribblies, which included Emma Bull, Pamela Dean, Will Shetterly, Nate Bucklin, Kara Dalkey, and Patricia Wrede. He also was a founding member of the Pre-Joycean Fellowship. He has rejected a distinction between science fiction and fantasy, stating that no belief in such a distinction can withstand an encounter with the writing of Roger Zelazny. = Writing style = There is a certain amount of variation in the writing style amongst the Taltos novels, as well as between Brust's various series. Brust uses a different narrative approach in almost every novel in the Taltos series. Some of these approaches are more purely stylistic and have minor effects on the actual story-telling; some are profound and involve the point of view of characters whom the reader never expected to get to know so well. Further, as the writing of the Taltos novels has spanned over three decades, they have been influenced by events in Brust's own life. A fascination with the Mafia ‚Äì subsequently brought into a somewhat shocking perspective by the murder of a friend ‚Äì profoundly influenced his storylines, as did the breakup of his marriage. The events and arguments of his books, especially Teckla, are acknowledged by Brust to be influenced by his lifelong interest in Marxist theory and practice. Brust's parents were activists in the Workers League, the predecessor to the Socialist Equality Party, and he continues to identify as a \\"Trotskyist sympathizer,\\" linking to the SEP-affiliated World Socialist Web Site on his personal website. He endorsed the SEP's presidential candidates in the 2016 US elections.http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2016/05/30/brus-m30.html = Literary theory = In contrast to contemporary academic studies in literature, Brust has put forward what he called \\"The Cool Stuff Theory of Literature\\": > All literature consists of whatever the writer thinks is cool. The reader > will like the book to the degree that he agrees with the writer about what's > cool. And that works all the way from the external trappings to the level of > metaphor, subtext, and the way one uses words. In other words, I happen not > to think that full-plate armor and great big honking greatswords are cool. I > don't like 'em. I like cloaks and rapiers. So I write stories with a lot of > cloaks and rapiers in 'em, 'cause that's cool. Guys who like military > hardware, who think advanced military hardware is cool, are not gonna jump > all over my books, because they have other ideas about what's cool. Brust elaborated, \\"The novel should be understood as a structure built to accommodate the greatest possible amount of cool stuff.\\" = Motifs = The character Devera, usually a cute brown-eyed girl of about nine, appears as a motif in all of Brust's novels. In the Dragaeran books her name is Devera. She is the (future) daughter of another character and seems to be able to appear anywhere in time and space. In Brust's non-Dragaeran books her appearances are usually brief and not always obvious.  Musical recordings and performances  Brust is a singer-songwriter and drummer who has recorded a solo album, and who has played in the Minneapolis-based folk rock band Cats Laughing, and with the Albany Free Traders,\\"A short visual trip down musical memory lane\\" (Albany Free Traders publicity flyer) . Geri Sullivan blog. February 1, 2007. Retrieved December 29, 2012. and Morrigan. Brust also co-wrote two songs on the 1994 album Antler Dance by the band Boiled in Lead, as well as many of the songs on BiL's 1995 multimedia CD Songs from The Gypsy. Cats Laughing Cats Laughing released two albums with Brust as drummer, in 1988 and 1990. Brust also contributed as a songwriter and vocalist. The 1990 album Another Way to Travel features cover art that depicts the band members and a vehicle known as the Catmobile, the band vehicle for Cats Laughing. The car, owned by Brust, was a Cadillac ambulance, painted yellow, light blue, and dark blue, with murals. On April 3, 2015, Brust performed as part of Cats Laughing in a reunion concert at the Minicon 50 science fiction convention in Bloomington, Minnesota. In March 2016, Cats Laughing released a double CD of their 2015 reunion, A Long Time Gone, as well as a DVD by the same title with documentary concert footage. Solo A Rose for Iconoclastes, a folk (or folk pop) album released in 1993, is Brust's only solo album. The title is a reference to \\"A Rose for Ecclesiastes\\", a short story by Brust's literary hero and mentor Roger Zelazny. (Interview in which Brust notes that a picture of Zelazny is on his desk.) Twelve of the fourteen songs were written or co- written by Brust. The album was produced by Adam Stemple, a fellow fantasy writer and member of Cats Laughing. Songs from The Gypsy (1995) The 1995 enhanced CD Songs from The Gypsy, by the band Boiled in Lead, featured songs written by Brust and Adam Stemple, as well as the full text of Brust's novel The Gypsy. AllMusic reviewer Steven McDonald called Songs from The Gypsy \\"an example of Brust's serious songwriting working well.\\" Conversely, a critical review by AllMusic's Roch Parisien emphasized that \\"Songs from The Gypsy represents a failure of multimedia integration. As an audio CD, the disc serves up ten songs, ranging from acoustic trad to bluesy rockers, that ironically form a less cohesive whole than previous Boiled in Lead releases. The better numbers (like the title track) incorporate Celtic rock with Hungarian, Middle Eastern and other interesting worldbeat influences.\\" Parisien found the album's integration with the novel unsuccessful, in that the novel's 17 chapters were presented as \\"scrollable text only, which also intersperse some 80 song lyric excerpts that you can play from hot buttons. Annoyingly, you must flip back to a main menu index to move from one chapter to the next.\\" Parisien concluded, \\"Despite Brust's engrossingly poetic, impressionist story inspired by Hungarian folk tales and revolving around three Gypsy brothers, the project does not overcome the primary limitation of bringing literature to the computer screen, that being that the computer offers an inhospitable environment for viewing literature-length text.\\" The review, written in 1995, predated a wave of popular e-book readers that began to emerge about ten years later. Other performances Brust has performed dramatically in several Shockwave Radio Theater productions, notably Closing Ceremonies (aka The Fall of the House of Usherette) and PBS Liavek.

Informally, the Fatou set of the function consists of values with the property that all nearby values behave similarly under repeated iteration of the function, and the Julia set consists of values such that an arbitrarily small perturbation can cause drastic changes in the sequence of iterated function values. Thus the behavior of the function on the Fatou set is \\"regular\\", while on the Julia set its behavior is \\"chaotic\\". The Julia set of a function f is commonly denoted J(f), and the Fatou set is denoted F(f).Note that for other areas of mathematics the notation J(f) can also represent the Jacobian matrix of a real valued mapping f between smooth manifolds. These sets are named after the French mathematicians Gaston JuliaGaston Julia (1918) \\"M√©moire sur l'iteration des fonctions rationnelles\\", Journal de Math√©matiques Pures et Appliqu√©es, vol. 8, pages 47‚Äì245. and Pierre FatouPierre Fatou (1917) \\"Sur les substitutions rationnelles\\", Comptes Rendus de l'Acad√©mie des Sciences de Paris, vol. 164, pages 806‚Äì808 and vol. 165, pages 992‚Äì995. whose work began the study of complex dynamics during the early 20th century. Formal definition Let f(z) be a nonconstant holomorphic function from the Riemann sphere onto itself. Such f(z) are precisely the nonconstant complex rational functions, that is, f(z) = p(z)/q(z), where p(z) and q(z) are complex polynomials. Assume that p and q have no common roots and at least one has degree larger than 1. Then there is a finite number of open sets F1, ..., Fr, that are left invariant by f(z) and are such that: # the union of the sets Fi is dense in the plane and # f(z) behaves in a regular and equal way on each of the sets Fi. The last statement means that the termini of the sequences of iterations generated by the points of Fi are either precisely the same set, which is then a finite cycle, or they are finite cycles of circular or annular shaped sets that are lying concentrically. In the first case the cycle is attracting, in the second it is neutral. These sets Fi are the Fatou domains of f(z), and their union is the Fatou set F(f) of f(z). Each of the Fatou domains contains at least one critical point of f(z), that is, a (finite) point z satisfying f'(z) = 0, or f(z) = \\\\infty, if the degree of the numerator p(z) is at least two larger than the degree of the denominator q(z), or if f(z) = 1/g(z) + c for some c and a rational function g(z) satisfying this condition. The complement of F(f) is the Julia set J(f) of f(z). If all the critical points are preperiodic, that is they are not periodic but eventually land on a periodic cycle, then J(f) is all the sphere; otherwise, J(f) is a nowhere dense set (it is without interior points) and an uncountable set (of the same cardinality as the real numbers). Like F(f), J(f) is left invariant by f(z), and on this set the iteration is repelling, meaning that f(z) - f(w) > z - w for all w in a neighbourhood of z (within J(f)). This means that f(z) behaves chaotically on the Julia set. Although there are points in the Julia set whose sequence of iterations is finite, there are only a countable number of such points (and they make up an infinitesimal part of the Julia set). The sequences generated by points outside this set behave chaotically, a phenomenon called deterministic chaos. There has been extensive research on the Fatou set and Julia set of iterated rational functions, known as rational maps. For example, it is known that the Fatou set of a rational map has either 0, 1, 2 or infinitely many components.Beardon, Iteration of Rational Functions, Theorem 5.6.2. Each component of the Fatou set of a rational map can be classified into one of four different classes.Beardon, Theorem 7.1.1. Equivalent descriptions of the Julia set * J(f) is the smallest closed set containing at least three points which is completely invariant under f. * J(f) is the closure of the set of repelling periodic points. * For all but at most two points z ‚àà X, the Julia set is the set of limit points of the full backwards orbit \\\\bigcup_n f^{-n}(z). (This suggests a simple algorithm for plotting Julia sets, see below.) * If f is an entire function, then J(f) is the boundary of the set of points which converge to infinity under iteration. * If f is a polynomial, then J(f) is the boundary of the filled Julia set; that is, those points whose orbits under iterations of f remain bounded. Properties of the Julia set and Fatou set The Julia set and the Fatou set of f are both completely invariant under iterations of the holomorphic function f:Beardon, Iteration of Rational Functions, Theorem 3.2.4. : f^{-1}(J(f)) = f(J(f)) = J(f), : f^{-1}(F(f)) = f(F(f)) = F(f). Examples For f(z) = z^{2} the Julia set is the unit circle and on this the iteration is given by doubling of angles (an operation that is chaotic on the points whose argument is not a rational fraction of 2\\\\pi). There are two Fatou domains: the interior and the exterior of the circle, with iteration towards 0 and ‚àû, respectively. For g(z) = z^{2} - 2 the Julia set is the line segment between ‚àí2 and 2. There is one Fatou domain: the points not on the line segment iterate towards ‚àû. (Apart from a shift and scaling of the domain, this iteration is equivalent to x \\\\to 4(x - \\\\tfrac{1}{2})^{2} on the unit interval, which is commonly used as an example of chaotic system.) The functions f and g are of the form z^2 + c, where c is a complex number. For such an iteration the Julia set is not in general a simple curve, but is a fractal, and for some values of c it can take surprising shapes. See the pictures below. Julia set (in white) for the rational function associated to Newton's method for f : z‚Üíz3‚àí1. Coloring of Fatou set according to attractor (the roots of f) For some functions f(z) we can say beforehand that the Julia set is a fractal and not a simple curve. This is because of the following result on the iterations of a rational function: > Theorem. Each of the Fatou domains has the same boundary, which consequently > is the Julia set. This means that each point of the Julia set is a point of accumulation for each of the Fatou domains. Therefore, if there are more than two Fatou domains, each point of the Julia set must have points of more than two different open sets infinitely close, and this means that the Julia set cannot be a simple curve. This phenomenon happens, for instance, when f(z) is the Newton iteration for solving the equation P(z) := z^n - 1 = 0, n > 2: :f(z) = z - \\\\frac{P(z)}{P'(z)} = \\\\frac{1 + (n-1)z^n}{nz^{n-1}}\\\\, .

Quadratic polynomials Julia sets for z^2 + 0.7885\\\\,e^{ia}, where a ranges from 0 to 2\\\\pi A video of the Julia sets as above A very popular complex dynamical system is given by the family of complex quadratic polynomials, a special case of rational maps. Such quadratic polynomials can be expressed as : f_c(z) = z^2 + c, where c is a complex parameter. Fix some R > 0 large enough that R^2 - R \\\\ge c. (For example, if c is in the Mandelbrot set, then c \\\\le 2, so we may simply let R = 2.) Then the filled Julia set for this system is the subset of the complex plane given by : K(f_c) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{z \\\\in \\\\mathbb C : \\\\forall n \\\\in \\\\mathbb N, f_c^n(z) \\\\le R \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, where f_c^n(z) is the nth iterate of f_c(z). The Julia set J(f_c) of this function is the boundary of K(f_c).

When laid out like this, the overall image resembles the Mandelbrot set. The parameter plane of quadratic polynomials ‚Äì that is, the plane of possible c values ‚Äì gives rise to the famous Mandelbrot set. Indeed, the Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of all c such that J(f_c) is connected. For parameters outside the Mandelbrot set, the Julia set is a Cantor space: in this case it is sometimes referred to as Fatou dust. In many cases, the Julia set of c looks like the Mandelbrot set in sufficiently small neighborhoods of c. This is true, in particular, for so- called Misiurewicz parameters, i.e. parameters c for which the critical point is pre-periodic. For instance: * At c = i, the shorter, front toe of the forefoot, the Julia set looks like a branched lightning bolt. * At c = ‚àí2, the tip of the long spiky tail, the Julia set is a straight line segment. In other words, the Julia sets J(f_c) are locally similar around Misiurewicz points.Tan Lei, \\"Similarity between the Mandelbrot set and Julia Sets\\", Communications in Mathematical Physics 134 (1990), pp. 587-617. Generalizations The definition of Julia and Fatou sets easily carries over to the case of certain maps whose image contains their domain; most notably transcendental meromorphic functions and Adam Epstein's finite-type maps. Julia sets are also commonly defined in the study of dynamics in several complex variables.  Pseudocode  The below pseudocode implementations hard code the functions for each fractal. Consider implementing complex number operations to allow for more dynamic and reusable code.  Pseudocode for normal Julia sets  : f(z) = z^2 + c R = escape radius # choose R > 0 such that R2 - R >= sqrt(cx2 + cy2) for each pixel (x, y) on the screen, do: { zx = scaled x coordinate of pixel # (scale to be between -R and R) # zx represents the real part of z. zy = scaled y coordinate of pixel # (scale to be between -R and R) # zy represents the imaginary part of z. iteration = 0 max_iteration = 1000 while (zx * zx + zy * zy < R2 AND iteration < max_iteration) { xtemp = zx * zx - zy * zy zy = 2 * zx * zy + cy zx = xtemp + cx iteration = iteration + 1 } if (iteration  max_iteration) return black; else return iteration; }  Pseudocode for multi-Julia sets  : f(z) = z^n + c R = escape radius # choose R > 0 such that Rn - R >= sqrt(cx2 + cy2) for each pixel (x, y) on the screen, do: { zx = scaled x coordinate of pixel # (scale to be between -R and R) zy = scaled y coordinate of pixel # (scale to be between -R and R) iteration = 0 max_iteration = 1000 while (zx * zx + zy * zy < R2 AND iteration < max_iteration) { xtmp = (zx * zx + zy * zy) ^ (n / 2) * cos(n * atan2(zy, zx)) + cx; zy = (zx * zx + zy * zy) ^ (n / 2) * sin(n * atan2(zy, zx)) + cy; zx = xtmp; iteration = iteration + 1 } if (iteration  max_iteration) return black; else return iteration; } The potential function and the real iteration number The Julia set for f(z) = z^{2} is the unit circle, and on the outer Fatou domain, the potential function œÜ(z) is defined by œÜ(z) = logz. The equipotential lines for this function are concentric circles. As f(z) = z^{2} we have :\\\\varphi(z) = \\\\lim_{k\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\logz_k}{2^k}, where z_k is the sequence of iteration generated by z. For the more general iteration f(z) = z^2 + c, it has been proved that if the Julia set is connected (that is, if c belongs to the (usual) Mandelbrot set), then there exist a biholomorphic map œà between the outer Fatou domain and the outer of the unit circle such that \\\\psi(f(z)) = \\\\psi(z)^{2}.Adrien Douady and John H. Hubbard, Etude dynamique des polyn√¥mes complexes, Pr√©publications math√©mathiques d'Orsay 2/4 (1984 / 1985) This means that the potential function on the outer Fatou domain defined by this correspondence is given by: :\\\\varphi(z) = \\\\lim_{k\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\logz_k}{2^k}. This formula has meaning also if the Julia set is not connected, so that we for all c can define the potential function on the Fatou domain containing ‚àû by this formula. For a general rational function f(z) such that ‚àû is a critical point and a fixed point, that is, such that the degree m of the numerator is at least two larger than the degree n of the denominator, we define the potential function on the Fatou domain containing ‚àû by: :\\\\varphi(z) = \\\\lim_{k\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\logz_k}{d^k}, where d = m ‚àí n is the degree of the rational function. If N is a very large number (e.g. 10100), and if k is the first iteration number such that z_k > N, we have that :\\\\frac{\\\\logz_k}{d^k} = \\\\frac{\\\\log(N)}{d^{ u(z)}}, for some real number u(z), which should be regarded as the real iteration number, and we have that: : u(z) = k - \\\\frac{\\\\log(\\\\logz_k/\\\\log(N))}{\\\\log(d)}, where the last number is in the interval [0, 1). For iteration towards a finite attracting cycle of order r, we have that if z* is a point of the cycle, then f(f(...f(z^*))) = z^* (the r-fold composition), and the number :\\\\alpha = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\left (d(f(f(\\\\cdots f(z))))/dz)_{z=z^*} \\\\right } \\\\qquad ( > 1) is the attraction of the cycle. If w is a point very near z* and w' is w iterated r times, we have that :\\\\alpha = \\\\lim_{k\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{w - z^*}{w' - z^*}. Therefore the number z_{kr} - z^*\\\\alpha^{k} is almost independent of k. We define the potential function on the Fatou domain by: :\\\\varphi(z) = \\\\lim_{k\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{(z_{kr} - z^*\\\\alpha^{k})}. If Œµ is a very small number and k is the first iteration number such that z_k - z^* < \\\\epsilon, we have that :\\\\varphi(z) = \\\\frac{1}{(\\\\varepsilon \\\\alpha^{ u(z)})} for some real number u(z), which should be regarded as the real iteration number, and we have that: : u(z) = k - \\\\frac{\\\\log(\\\\varepsilon/z_k - z^*)}{\\\\log(\\\\alpha)}. If the attraction is ‚àû, meaning that the cycle is super- attracting, meaning again that one of the points of the cycle is a critical point, we must replace Œ± by :\\\\alpha = \\\\lim_{k\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\logw' - z^*}{\\\\logw - z^*}, where w' is w iterated r times and the formula for œÜ(z) by: :\\\\varphi(z) = \\\\lim_{k\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\log(1/z_{kr} - z^*)}{\\\\alpha^k}. And now the real iteration number is given by: : u(z) = k - \\\\frac{\\\\log(\\\\logz_k - z^*/\\\\log(\\\\varepsilon))}{\\\\log(\\\\alpha)}. For the colouring we must have a cyclic scale of colours (constructed mathematically, for instance) and containing H colours numbered from 0 to H‚àí1 (H = 500, for instance). We multiply the real number u(z) by a fixed real number determining the density of the colours in the picture, and take the integral part of this number modulo H. The definition of the potential function and our way of colouring presuppose that the cycle is attracting, that is, not neutral. If the cycle is neutral, we cannot colour the Fatou domain in a natural way. As the terminus of the iteration is a revolving movement, we can, for instance, colour by the minimum distance from the cycle left fixed by the iteration. Field lines The equipotential lines for iteration towards infinityField lines for an iteration of the form \\\\frac{(1 - z^3/6)}{(z - z^{2}/2)^2} + cIn each Fatou domain (that is not neutral) there are two systems of lines orthogonal to each other: the equipotential lines (for the potential function or the real iteration number) and the field lines. If we colour the Fatou domain according to the iteration number (and not the real iteration number u(z), as defined in the previous section), the bands of iteration show the course of the equipotential lines. If the iteration is towards ‚àû (as is the case with the outer Fatou domain for the usual iteration z^{2} + c), we can easily show the course of the field lines, namely by altering the colour according as the last point in the sequence of iteration is above or below the x-axis (first picture), but in this case (more precisely: when the Fatou domain is super-attracting) we cannot draw the field lines coherently - at least not by the method we describe here. In this case a field line is also called an external ray. Let z be a point in the attracting Fatou domain. If we iterate z a large number of times, the terminus of the sequence of iteration is a finite cycle C, and the Fatou domain is (by definition) the set of points whose sequence of iteration converges towards C. The field lines issue from the points of C and from the (infinite number of) points that iterate into a point of C. And they end on the Julia set in points that are non-chaotic (that is, generating a finite cycle). Let r be the order of the cycle C (its number of points) and let z* be a point in C. We have f(f(\\\\dots f(z^*))) = z^* (the r-fold composition), and we define the complex number Œ± by :\\\\alpha = (d(f(f(\\\\dots f(z))))/dz)_{z=z^*}. If the points of C are z_i, i = 1, \\\\dots, r (z_1 = z^*), Œ± is the product of the r numbers f'(z_i). The real number 1/Œ± is the attraction of the cycle, and our assumption that the cycle is neither neutral nor super-attracting, means that 1 < 1/Œ± < ‚àû. The point z* is a fixed point for f(f(\\\\dots f(z))), and near this point the map f(f(\\\\dots f(z))) has (in connection with field lines) character of a rotation with the argument Œ≤ of Œ± (that is, \\\\alpha = \\\\alphae^{\\\\beta i}). In order to colour the Fatou domain, we have chosen a small number Œµ and set the sequences of iteration z_k (k = 0, 1, 2, \\\\dots, z_0 = z) to stop when z_k - z^* < \\\\epsilon, and we colour the point z according to the number k (or the real iteration number, if we prefer a smooth colouring). If we choose a direction from z* given by an angle Œ∏, the field line issuing from z* in this direction consists of the points z such that the argument œà of the number z_k - z^* satisfies the condition that :\\\\psi - k\\\\beta = \\\\theta \\\\mod \\\\pi. \\\\, For if we pass an iteration band in the direction of the field lines (and away from the cycle), the iteration number k is increased by 1 and the number œà is increased by Œ≤, therefore the number \\\\psi - k\\\\beta \\\\mod \\\\pi is constant along the field line. Pictures in the field lines for an iteration of the form z^2 + c A colouring of the field lines of the Fatou domain means that we colour the spaces between pairs of field lines: we choose a number of regularly situated directions issuing from z*, and in each of these directions we choose two directions around this direction. As it can happen that the two field lines of a pair do not end in the same point of the Julia set, our coloured field lines can ramify (endlessly) in their way towards the Julia set. We can colour on the basis of the distance to the center line of the field line, and we can mix this colouring with the usual colouring. Such pictures can be very decorative (second picture). A coloured field line (the domain between two field lines) is divided up by the iteration bands, and such a part can be put into a one- to-one correspondence with the unit square: the one coordinate is (calculated from) the distance from one of the bounding field lines, the other is (calculated from) the distance from the inner of the bounding iteration bands (this number is the non-integral part of the real iteration number). Therefore, we can put pictures into the field lines (third picture).  Plotting the Julia set  Binary decomposition of interior in case of internal angle 0 Methods : * Distance Estimation Method for Julia set (DEM/J) * Inverse Iteration Method (IIM) Using backwards (inverse) iteration (IIM)  A Julia set plot, generated using random IIM A Julia set plot, generated using MIIM As mentioned above, the Julia set can be found as the set of limit points of the set of pre-images of (essentially) any given point. So we can try to plot the Julia set of a given function as follows. Start with any point z we know to be in the Julia set, such as a repelling periodic point, and compute all pre-images of z under some high iterate f^n of f. Unfortunately, as the number of iterated pre-images grows exponentially, this is not feasible computationally. However, we can adjust this method, in a similar way as the \\"random game\\" method for iterated function systems. That is, in each step, we choose at random one of the inverse images of f. For example, for the quadratic polynomial fc, the backwards iteration is described by :z_{n-1} = \\\\sqrt{z_n - c} . At each step, one of the two square roots is selected at random. Note that certain parts of the Julia set are quite difficult to access with the reverse Julia algorithm. For this reason, one must modify IIM/J ( it is called MIIM/J) or use other methods to produce better images. Using DEM/J File:Demj.jpgc=-0.74543+0.11301*i File:Julia dem.pngc= -0.75+0.11*i File:Julia dem c=-0.1+0.651.png c=-0.1+0.651*i File:Juliasetsdkjulia1.jpgJulia set drawn by distance estimation, the iteration is of the form 1-z^2+z^5/(2 + 4z)+c File:Juliasetsdkland1.jpgThree- dimensional rendering of Julia set using distance estimation As a Julia set is infinitely thin we cannot draw it effectively by backwards iteration from the pixels. It will appear fragmented because of the impracticality of examining infinitely many startpoints. Since the iteration count changes vigorously near the Julia set, a partial solution is to imply the outline of the set from the nearest color contours, but the set will tend to look muddy. A better way to draw the Julia set in black and white is to estimate the distance of pixels (DEM) from the set and to color every pixel whose center is close to the set. The formula for the distance estimation is derived from the formula for the potential function œÜ(z). When the equipotential lines for œÜ(z) lie close, the number \\\\varphi'(z) is large, and conversely, therefore the equipotential lines for the function \\\\delta(z) = \\\\varphi(z)/\\\\varphi'(z) should lie approximately regularly. It has been proven that the value found by this formula (up to a constant factor) converges towards the true distance for z converging towards the Julia set. We assume that f(z) is rational, that is, f(z) = p(z)/q(z) where p(z) and q(z) are complex polynomials of degrees m and n, respectively, and we have to find the derivative of the above expressions for œÜ(z). And as it is only z_k that varies, we must calculate the derivative z'_k of z_k with respect to z. But as z_k = f(f(\\\\cdots f(z))) (the k-fold composition), z'_k is the product of the numbers f'(z_k), and this sequence can be calculated recursively by z'_{k+1} = f'(z_k)z'_k, starting with z'_0 = 1 (before the calculation of the next iteration z_{k+1} = f(z_k)). For iteration towards ‚àû (more precisely when m ‚â• n + 2, so that ‚àû is a super- attracting fixed point), we have :\\\\varphi'(z) = \\\\lim_{k\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{z'_k}{z_kd^k}, (d = m ‚àí n) and consequently: :\\\\delta(z) = \\\\varphi(z)/\\\\varphi'(z) = \\\\lim_{k\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\logz_kz_k/z'_k. \\\\, For iteration towards a finite attracting cycle (that is not super-attracting) containing the point z* and having order r, we have :\\\\varphi'(z) = \\\\lim_{k\\\\to\\\\infty} z'_{kr}/(z_{kr} - z^*^{2}\\\\alpha^{k}), \\\\, and consequently: :\\\\delta(z) = \\\\varphi(z)/\\\\varphi'(z) = \\\\lim_{k\\\\to\\\\infty} z_{kr} - z^*/z'_{kr}. \\\\, For a super-attracting cycle, the formula is: :\\\\delta(z) = \\\\lim_{k\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\logz_{kr} - z^*^2/z'_{kr}. \\\\, We calculate this number when the iteration stops. Note that the distance estimation is independent of the attraction of the cycle. This means that it has meaning for transcendental functions of \\"degree infinity\\" (e.g. sin(z) and tan(z)). Besides drawing of the boundary, the distance function can be introduced as a 3rd dimension to create a solid fractal landscape.

It is expressed as the angle between a reference plane and the orbital plane or axis of direction of the orbiting object. For a satellite orbiting the Earth directly above the equator, the plane of the satellite's orbit is the same as the Earth's equatorial plane, and the satellite's orbital inclination is 0¬∞. The general case for a circular orbit is that it is tilted, spending half an orbit over the northern hemisphere and half over the southern. If the orbit swung between 20¬∞ north latitude and 20¬∞ south latitude, then its orbital inclination would be 20¬∞. Orbits The inclination is one of the six orbital elements describing the shape and orientation of a celestial orbit. It is the angle between the orbital plane and the plane of reference, normally stated in degrees. For a satellite orbiting a planet, the plane of reference is usually the plane containing the planet's equator. For planets in the Solar System, the plane of reference is usually the ecliptic, the plane in which the Earth orbits the Sun. This reference plane is most practical for Earth-based observers. Therefore, Earth's inclination is, by definition, zero. Inclination can instead be measured with respect to another plane, such as the Sun's equator or the invariable plane (the plane that represents the angular momentum of the Solar System, approximately the orbital plane of Jupiter).  Natural and artificial satellites  The inclination of orbits of natural or artificial satellites is measured relative to the equatorial plane of the body they orbit, if they orbit sufficiently closely. The equatorial plane is the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the central body. An inclination of 30¬∞ could also be described using an angle of 150¬∞. The convention is that the normal orbit is prograde, an orbit in the same direction as the planet rotates. Inclinations greater than 90¬∞ describe retrograde orbits. Thus: * An inclination of 0¬∞ means the orbiting body has a prograde orbit in the planet's equatorial plane. * An inclination greater than 0¬∞ and less than 90¬∞ also describes a prograde orbit. * An inclination of 63.4¬∞ is often called a critical inclination, when describing artificial satellites orbiting the Earth, because they have zero apogee drift.Arctic Communications System Utilizing Satellites in Highly Elliptical Orbits, Lars L√∏ge ‚Äì Section 3.1, Page 17 * An inclination of exactly 90¬∞ is a polar orbit, in which the spacecraft passes over the poles of the planet. * An inclination greater than 90¬∞ and less than 180¬∞ is a retrograde orbit. * An inclination of exactly 180¬∞ is a retrograde equatorial orbit. For impact-generated moons of terrestrial planets not too far from their star, with a large planet‚Äìmoon distance, the orbital planes of moons tend to be aligned with the planet's orbit around the star due to tides from the star, but if the planet‚Äìmoon distance is small, it may be inclined. For gas giants, the orbits of moons tend to be aligned with the giant planet's equator, because these formed in circumplanetary disks.Moon formation and orbital evolution in extrasolar planetary systems-A literature review, K Lewis ‚Äì EPJ Web of Conferences, 2011 ‚Äì epj-conferences.org Strictly speaking, this applies only to regular satellites. Captured bodies on distant orbits vary widely in their inclinations, while captured bodies in relatively close orbits tend to have low inclinations owing to tidal effects and perturbations by large regular satellites. Exoplanets and multiple star systems The inclination of exoplanets or members of multiple stars is the angle of the plane of the orbit relative to the plane perpendicular to the line of sight from Earth to the object. * An inclination of 0¬∞ is a face-on orbit, meaning the plane of the exoplanet's orbit is perpendicular to the line of sight with Earth. * An inclination of 90¬∞ is an edge-on orbit, meaning the plane of the exoplanet's orbit is parallel to the line of sight with Earth. Since the word \\"inclination\\" is used in exoplanet studies for this line-of-sight inclination, the angle between the planet's orbit and the star's rotation must use a different word and is termed the \\"spin-orbit angle\\" or \\"spin-orbit alignment\\". In most cases the orientation of the star's rotational axis is unknown. Because the radial-velocity method more easily finds planets with orbits closer to edge-on, most exoplanets found by this method have inclinations between 45¬∞ and 135¬∞, although in most cases the inclination is not known. Consequently, most exoplanets found by radial velocity have true masses no more than 40% greater than their minimum masses. If the orbit is almost face- on, especially for superjovians detected by radial velocity, then those objects may actually be brown dwarfs or even red dwarfs. One particular example is HD 33636 B, which has true mass 142 MJ, corresponding to an M6V star, while its minimum mass was 9.28 MJ. If the orbit is almost edge-on, then the planet can be seen transiting its star. Calculation Components of the calculation of the orbital inclination from the momentum vector In astrodynamics, the inclination i can be computed from the orbital momentum vector h (or any vector perpendicular to the orbital plane) as :i=\\\\arccos{h_z\\\\over\\\\lefth\\\\right} where h_z is the z-component of h. Mutual inclination of two orbits may be calculated from their inclinations to another plane using cosine rule for angles. Observations and theories Most planetary orbits in the Solar System have relatively small inclinations, both in relation to each other and to the Sun's equator: On the other hand, the dwarf planets Pluto and Eris have inclinations to the ecliptic of 17¬∞ and 44¬∞ respectively, and the large asteroid Pallas is inclined at 34¬∞. In 1966, Peter Goldreich published a classic paper on the evolution of the moon's orbit and on the orbits of other moons in the solar system. Termed \\"classic\\" by He showed that, for each planet, there is a distance such that moons closer to the planet than that distance maintain an almost constant orbital inclination with respect to the planet's equator (with an orbital precession mostly due to the tidal influence of the planet), whereas moons farther away maintain an almost constant orbital inclination with respect to the ecliptic (with precession due mostly to the tidal influence of the sun). The moons in the first category, with the exception of Neptune's moon Triton, orbit near the equatorial plane. He concluded that these moons formed from equatorial accretion disks. But he found that our moon, although it was once inside the critical distance from the earth, never had an equatorial orbit as would be expected from various scenarios for its origin. This is called the lunar inclination problem, to which various solutions have since been proposed.  Other meaning  For planets and other rotating celestial bodies, the angle of the equatorial plane relative to the orbital plane ‚Äî such as the tilt of the Earth's poles toward or away from the Sun ‚Äî is sometimes also called inclination, but less ambiguous terms are axial tilt or obliquity.

Covering topics such as plurals and literary technique, distinctions among like words (homonyms and synonyms), and the use of foreign terms, the dictionary became the standard for other style guides to writing in English. Hence, the 1926 first edition remains in print, along with the 1965 second edition, edited by Ernest Gowers, which was reprinted in 1983 and 1987. The 1996 third edition was re-titled as The New Fowler's Modern English Usage, and revised in 2004, was mostly rewritten by Robert W. Burchfield, as a usage dictionary that incorporated corpus linguistics data;Third edition preface, p. xi. and the 2015 fourth edition, revised and re-titled Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage, was edited by Jeremy Butterfield, as a usage dictionary. Informally, users refer to the style guide and dictionary as Fowler's Modern English Usage, Fowler, and Fowler's. Linguistic approach In A Dictionary of Modern English Usage, Henry W. Fowler's general approach encourages a direct, vigorous writing style, and opposes all artificiality, by firmly advising against convoluted sentence construction, the use of foreign words and phrases, and the use of archaisms. He opposed pedantry, and ridiculed artificial grammar rules unwarranted by natural English usage, such as bans on ending a sentence with a preposition; rules on the placement of the word only; and rules distinguishing between which and that. He classified and condemned every clich√©, in the course of which he coined and popularised the terms battered ornament, vogue words, and worn-out humour, while defending useful distinctions between words whose meanings were coalescing in practice, thereby guiding the speaker and the writer away from illogical sentence construction, and the misuse of words. In the entries \\"Pedantic Humour\\" and \\"Polysyllabic Humour\\" Fowler mocked the use of arcane words (archaisms) and the use of unnecessarily long words. Quotations Widely and often cited, A Dictionary of Modern English Usage is renowned for its witty passages, such as: > ; Didacticism : The speaker who has discovered that Juan and Quixote are not > pronounced in Spain as he used to pronounce them as a boy is not content to > keep so important a piece of information to himself; he must have the rest > of us call them Hwan and Keehotay; at any rate he will give us the chance of > mending our ignorant ways by doing so.A Dictionary of Modern Usage, Second > Edition, 1965.

Editions Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage. Before writing A Dictionary of Modern English Usage, Henry W. Fowler and his younger brother, Francis George Fowler (1871‚Äì1918), wrote and revised The King's English (1906), a grammar and usage guide. Assisted in the research by Francis, who died in 1918 of tuberculosis contracted (1915‚Äì16) whilst serving with the British Expeditionary Force in the First World War (1914‚Äì1918), Henry dedicated the first edition of the Dictionary to his late brother: > I think of it as it should have been, with its prolixities docked, its > dullnesses enlivened, its fads eliminated, its truths multiplied.

The first edition of A Dictionary of Modern English Usage was published in 1926, and then was reprinted with corrections in 1930, 1937, 1954, and in 2009, with an introduction and commentary by the linguist David Crystal. The second edition, titled Fowler's Modern English Usage, was published in 1965, revised and edited by Ernest Gowers. The third edition, The New Fowler's Modern English Usage, was published in 1996, edited by Robert Burchfield; and in 2004, Burchfield's revision of the 1996 edition was published as Fowler's Modern English Usage. The fourth edition, Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage, was published in 2015, edited by Jeremy Butterfield.Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage The modernisation of A Dictionary of English Usage (1926) yielded the Pocket Fowler's Modern English Usage (1999), edited by the lexicographer Robert Allen, which is based upon Burchfield's 1996 edition; the modernised edition is a forty per cent abridgement realised with reduced-length entries and the omission of about half the entries of the 1996 edition.

Often the term \\"jeans\\" refers to a particular style of trousers, called \\"blue jeans\\", which were invented by Jacob W. Davis in partnership with Levi Strauss & Co. in 1871 and patented by Jacob W. Davis and Levi Strauss on May 20, 1873. Prior to the Levi Strauss patented trousers, the term \\"blue jeans\\" had been long in use for various garments (including trousers, overalls, and coats), constructed from blue-colored denim.See, e.g., The Richmond Enquirer (Richmond, VA) March 25, 1823, wherein a paid notice described the ready-made apparel stolen by a thief : FIFTY DOLLARS REWARD, FOR JEREMIAH, or as he is commonly called Jerry Hatcher, lately a convict of the Penitentiary, who on the night of the 17th February last did break through my store and carry off a variety of goods, together with about $20 in change and some ready made clothing, and has made his escape. He is about 4 1/2 or 5 feet high, stout and very well made, with light hair, and I expect has on blue Jeans coatee and brown pantaloons, as he took such from me and has been seen with them on. I expect he is either in Richmond, Petersburg or Lynchburg. Any person who will apprehend said Hatcher and deliver him to me, will meet with my thanks, and the above reward. BRIGHTBERRY BROWN [,] Red Mills, Buckingham [County, Virginia], March 14. \\"Jean\\" also references a (historic) type of sturdy cloth commonly made with a cotton warp and wool weft (also known as \\"Virginia cloth\\"). Jean cloth can be entirely cotton as well, similar to denim. Originally designed for miners, modern jeans were popularized as casual wear by Marlon Brando and James Dean in their 1950s films, particularly The Wild One and Rebel Without a Cause, leading to the fabric becoming a symbol of rebellion among teenagers, especially members of the greaser subculture. From the 1960s onwards, jeans became common among various youth subcultures and subsequently young members of the general population. Nowadays, they are one of the most popular types of specialty trousers in Western culture. Historic brands include Levi's, Lee, and Wrangler.  History  Fabric  A traditional women's Genoese dress in \\"blue jeans\\" (1890s). Palazzo Spinola di Pellicceria, Genoa, Italy. Research on the trade of jean fabric shows that it emerged in the cities of Genoa, Italy, and N√Æmes, France. G√™nes, the French word for Genoa, may be the origin of the word \\"jeans\\". In N√Æmes, weavers tried to reproduce jean fabric but instead developed a similar twill fabric that became known as denim, from de N√Æmes, meaning \\"from N√Æmes\\". Genoa's jean fabric was a fustian textile of \\"medium quality and of reasonable cost\\", very similar to cotton corduroy for which Genoa was famous, and was \\"used for work clothes in general\\". The Genoese navy equipped its sailors with jeans, as they needed a fabric which could be worn wet or dry. N√Æmes's \\"denim\\" was coarser, considered higher quality, and was used \\"for over garments such as smocks or overalls\\". In 1576 a quantity of \\"jean fustians\\" arrived into the port of Barnstaple on a vessel from Bristol. Nearly all indigo, needed for dyeing, came from indigo bush plantations in India until the late 19th century. It was replaced by indigo synthesis methods developed in Germany. Copper rivets for reinforcing pockets are a characteristic feature of blue jeans. By the 17th century, jean was a crucial textile for working-class people in Northern Italy. This is seen in a series of genre paintings from around the 17th century attributed to an artist now nicknamed The Master of the Blue Jeans. The ten paintings depict impoverished scenes with lower-class figures wearing a fabric that looks like denim. The fabric would have been Genoese jean, which was cheaper. Genre painting came to prominence in late 16th century, and the non-nobility subject matter in all ten paintings places them among others that portray similar scenes. Dungaree was mentioned for the first time in the 17th century, when it was referred to as cheap, coarse thick cotton cloth, often colored blue but sometimes white, worn by impoverished people in what was then a region of Bombay, India a dockside village called Dongri. This cloth was \\"dungri\\" in Hindi. Dungri was exported to England and used for manufacturing of cheap, robust working clothes. In English, the word \\"dungri\\" became pronounced as \\"dungaree\\".  Rivets  The term jeans appears first in 1795, when a Swiss banker by the name Jean-Gabriel Eynard and his brother Jacques went to Genoa and both were soon heading a flourishing commercial concern. In 1800 Massena's troops entered the town and Jean-Gabriel was entrusted with their supply. In particular he furnished them with uniforms cut from blue cloth called \\"bleu de Genes\\" whence later derives the famous garment known worldwide as \\"blue jeans\\". Levi Strauss, as a young man in 1851, went from Germany to New York to join his older brothers who ran a goods store. In 1853, he moved to San Francisco to open his own dry goods business. Jacob Davis was a tailor who often bought bolts of cloth from the Levi Strauss & Co. wholesale house. In 1872, Davis wrote to Strauss asking to partner with him to patent and sell clothing reinforced with rivets. The copper rivets were to reinforce the points of stress, such as pocket corners and at the bottom of the button fly. Levi accepted Davis's offer,Wagman-Gellar, Marlene (2010). Eureka!: The Surprising Stories Behind the Ideas That Shaped the World, Eureka #3 (1871) (unpaginated). Penguin Group (USA), Inc. Retrieved October 2, 2011. and the two men received US patent No. 139,121 for an \\"Improvement in Fastening Pocket-Openings\\" on May 20, 1873. The classic label for Levi 501 jeans. Davis and Strauss experimented with different fabrics. An early attempt was brown cotton duck, a bottom-weight fabric. Finding denim a more suitable material for work-pants, they began using it to manufacture their riveted pants. The denim used was produced by an American manufacturer. Popular legend incorrectly states that it was imported from Nimes, France. A popular myth is that Strauss initially sold brown canvas pants to miners, later dyed them blue, turned to using denim, and only after Davis wrote to him, added rivets. Initially, Strauss's jeans were simply sturdy trousers worn by factory workers, miners, farmers, and cattlemen throughout the North American West. During this period, men's jeans had the fly down the front, whereas women's jeans had the fly down the left side. When Levi Strauss & Co. patented the modern, mass-produced prototype in the year 1873, there were two pockets in the front and one on the back right with copper rivets.Sullivan, J. (2006). Jeans: A cultural history of an American icon. New York: Gotham Books The small riveted watch pocket was first added by Levi Strauss to their jeans in the late 1870s. 20th century evolution In 1901 Levi Strauss added the back left pocket to their 501 model. This created the now familiar and industry standard five pocket configuration with two large pockets and small watch pocket in front with two pockets on the rear. Fewer jeans were made during World War II, but 'waist overalls' were introduced to the world by US soldiers, who sometimes wore them off duty. By the 1960s, both men's and women's jeans had the zipper down the front. Historic photographs indicate that in the decades before they became a staple of fashion, jeans generally fit quite loosely, much like a pair of bib overalls without the bib. Indeed, until 1960, Levi Strauss called its flagship product \\"waist overalls\\" rather than \\"jeans\\". After James Dean popularized them in the movie Rebel Without a Cause, wearing jeans became a symbol of youth rebellion during the 1950s.Schober, Anna (2001). Blue Jeans. Vom Leben in Stoffen und Bildern. Frankfurt/ New York: Campus. During the 1960s the wearing of jeans became more acceptable, and by the 1970s it had become general fashion in the United States for casual wear. In Japan in 1977, a professor of Osaka University Philip Karl Pehda chastised a female student wearing jeans in the classroom. Then he was protested by the students, and a controversy arose in the country. Examples of intentional denim distressing strictly to make them more fashionable can be seen as early as 1935 in Vogue's June issue. Michael Belluomo, editor of Sportswear International Magazine, Oct/Nov 1987, P. 45, wrote that in 1965, Limbo, a boutique in the New York East Village, was \\"the first retailer to wash a new pair of jeans to get a used, worn effect, and the idea became a hit.\\" He continued, \\"[Limbo] hired East Village artists to embellish the jeans with patches, decals, and other touches, and sold them for $200.\\" In the early 1980s the denim industry introduced the stone-washing technique developed by GWG also known as \\"Great Western Garment Co.\\" Donald Freeland of Edmonton, Alberta pioneered the method, which helped to bring denim to a larger and more versatile market. Acceptance of jeans continued through the 1980s and 1990s. Originally an esoteric fashion choice, in the 2010s jeans may be seen being worn by men and women of all ages.  Manufacturing processes   Dyeing  Chemical structure of indigo dye, the blue of blue jeans. Traditionally, jeans were dyed to a blue color using natural indigo dye. Most denim is now dyed using synthetic indigo. Approximately 20 thousand tons of indigo are produced annually for this purpose, though only a few grams of the dye are required for each pair.Elmar Steingruber \\"Indigo and Indigo Colorants\\" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2004, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. For other colors of denim other dyes must be used. Currently, jeans are produced in any color that can be achieved with cotton. For more information on dyeing, refer to denim and the discussion there of using pigment dyes.  Pre-shrinking  Young people wearing a variety of jean styles, including carpenter jeans, bootcut jeans, drainpipe jeans and lowrise jeans. (Rome, 2008) In 1962 Levi Strauss introduced their own pre-shrunk jeans (Lee and Wrangler jeans had already long been pre- shrunk); these did not shrink further after purchase, allowing the consumer to purchase a correctly fitting size. Pre-shrink is most common in jeans nowadays. These jeans were known as the 505 regular fit jeans. The 505 are almost identical to the 501s with the exception of the button-fly. The Levi's Corporation also introduced a slim boot-cut fit known as 517 and 527. The difference between the two is the 517s sit at the waist line and the 527s sit below the waist line. Later, Levi's would develop other styles and fits such as the loose, slim, comfort, relaxed, skinny, and a regular fit with a tapered leg.  Used and distressed looks  Ronald Reagan wearing stonewash denim associated with Western clothing, 1970s The used or \\"acid wash\\" look is created by means of abrading the jeans and/or treating them with chemicals, such as acryl resin, phenol, a hypochlorite, potassium permanganate, caustic soda, acids etc.Der preis der Bluejeans documentary by Studio Hamburg 2012 Ripping or distressing of jeans, though also arising naturally as a result of wear and tear, is sometimes deliberately performed by suppliers‚Äîwith distressed clothing sometimes selling for more than a nondistressed pair. For example, Pucci sold \\"embellished mid-rise boyfriend jeans\\" for ¬£600 (US$860). Sandblasting or abrading with sandpaper Consumers wanting jeans that appear worn can buy jeans that have been specially treated. To give the fabrics the worn look, sandblasting done with chemicals or by adding pumice stone to the washing process or abrading with sandpaper is often done.  Environmental and humanitarian impact  A typical pair of blue jeans uses 919 gallons (3479 liters) of water during its life cycle. This includes the water to irrigate the cotton crop, manufacture the jeans, and the numerous washes by the consumer. The production of jeans with a \\"used look\\" can be more environmentally damaging than regular jeans, depending on how the waste compounds are processed. Sandblasting and treating with sandpaper has the risk of causing silicosis to the workers, and in Turkey, more than 5,000 textile workers have been stricken with this disease, and 46 people are known to have died. Some companies have announced they are banning the use of sandblasting.  Care and wear  Despite most jeans being \\"pre-shrunk\\", they are still sensitive to slight further shrinkage and loss of color from being washed. The Levi Strauss company recommends avoiding washing jeans as much as possible. Carl Chiara, Levi Strauss director of brand and special projects, has a credo: The less you wash your jeans, the better your jeans become. These and other suggestions to avoid washing jeans where possible have encountered criticism. Cory Warren, editor of LS&Co.; Unzipped, clarifies in a response to such a criticism: For those who prefer to refrain from washing their jeans there have been suggestions to freeze them in order to kill the germs that cause odor. However, this advice has been proven ineffective.  Legal cases  Italian rape trial In Rome, Italy, in 1992, a 45-year-old driving instructor was accused of rape. When he picked up an 18-year-old girl for her first driving lesson, he allegedly raped her for an hour, then told her that if she was to tell anyone he would kill her. Later that night she told her parents and her parents agreed to help her press charges. While the alleged rapist was convicted and sentenced, the Italian Court of Cassation overturned the conviction in 1998 because the victim wore tight jeans. It was argued that she must have necessarily had to help her attacker remove her jeans, thus making the act consensual (\\"because the victim wore very, very tight jeans, she had to help him remove them... and by removing the jeans... it was no longer rape but consensual sex\\"). The court stated in its decision \\"it is a fact of common experience that it is nearly impossible to slip off tight jeans even partly without the active collaboration of the person who is wearing them.\\" The ruling sparked widespread feminist protest. The day after the decision, women in the Italian Parliament protested by wearing jeans and holding placards that read \\"Jeans: An Alibi for Rape\\". As a sign of support, the California Senate and the California Assembly followed suit. Patricia Giggans, the executive director of the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women (now Peace Over Violence) soon made Denim Day an annual event. at least 20 U.S. states officially recognize Denim Day in April. Wearing jeans on that day has become an international symbol of protest against such attitudes about sexual assault. As of 2008, the court has overturned its findings, and there is no longer a \\"denim\\" defense to the charge of rape. Indian divorce case In 2014, an Indian family court in Mumbai ruled that a husband's objection to his wife wearing a kurta and jeans and forcing her to wear a sari amounts to cruelty inflicted by the husband and can be a ground to seek a divorce. The wife was thus granted a divorce on the ground of cruelty as defined under Section 27(1)(d) of the Special Marriage Act, 1954.  Trends  Worldwide market for jeans  North America accounts for 39% of global purchases for jeans, followed by Western Europe at 20%, Japan and Korea at 10% and the rest of the world at 31%. United States consumers spent more than US$14 billion on jeans in 2004 and US$15 billion in 2005. US consumers bought US$13.8 billion of men's and women's jeans in the year that ended April 30, 2011, according to market-research firm NPD Group.  Soviet Union  In the Soviet Union, jeans were the symbol of the Western way of life. The \\"jeans fever\\" in the USSR started in 1957 during the World Festival of Youth and Students. According to a 1961 Soviet textile dictionary, jeans were initially referred to as a \\"worker's uniform\\" (—Ä–∞–±–æ—á–∏–π –∫–æ—Å—Ç—é–º, rabochii kostyum). The jeans brand Rokotov and Fainberg is named after the defendants in the Rokotov‚ÄìFaibishenko case, who were executed for, among other things, trafficking in jeans.Rudevich, Alexei. Worth going to prison for: Getting hold of jeans in the USSR. Russia Beyond the Headlines, September 16, 2014. Accessed on November 16, 2014. Although not outright banned, jeans were hard to come by in Soviet Union since they were seen as a symbol of rebellion by the Soviet youth, who wanted to emulate the style of film and rock stars of the West. The Soviet government resisted supplying the market with jeans as it would mean responding to the market, a capitalist principle. People went to great lengths, sometimes by resorting to violence and other illegal activities, to obtain real Western-made jeans. That led to the creation of black markets and to th bootlegging of jeans, which since has become an important cultural element of the history of the Soviet Union.  Market-share shift to activewear  In 2014, teens were buying more fashion and athleisure clothing from brands such as Nike and Lululemon over denim classics from brands like Abercrombie & Fitch. Activewear in 2014 comprised 28% of teens' apparel purchases, up from 6% in 2008. In 2014, Nike, Lululemon, Under Armour, and Adidas were the most popular brands for athletic apparel among teen consumers. Fashion retailers have begun to adjust their offerings accordingly. Bloomberg reports that Levi's stuck to its core product (denim) instead of adapting to consumer trends. As a result, Levi's sales decreased from over US$7 billion to US$4.8 billion in 2015. Variations on the basic type * Cigarette: Designed to fit quite closely, but not tightly, to the thigh area, with a less close fit to the calf * Cropped: Where the leg is cut to a lesser length, to somewhere above the ankle * Relaxed * Skinny: For people whose bodies are more svelte (thin), additionally worn to flatter the figure in the fashion of tight or close fitting * Straight * Wide-leg; or with cropped variant: The waist line rides up past the wearer's actual waist, material below the knee is altogether away from the leg and descends as a straight line, standard type descends down to the ankle; cropped variant: the leg ceases at the lower leg mid-way down (or stops further down toward the ankle)  Distressed jeans  Ripped jeans Distressed denim emerged from the cultural punk movement in the 1970s. Early punks tore apart consumer goods as an expression of their anger towards society. Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols manifested the British punk ideology, which was fighting against the status quo. Denim became a key target of this politically fueled deconstruction, with both men and women donning torn pants and jackets, accessorized with safety pins and slogans. The trend became popular again in the 1990s with the emergence of grunge fashion. If punk was \\"anti-fashion\\", grunge was \\"non-fashion\\". The grunge youth wore loose-fitting ripped jeans, flannel shirts or woolen Pendletons layered over T-shirts. Their anti-conformist approach to fashion led to the popularization of the casual chic look, a trend which continued into the 2000s.  Low-rise jeans  Media reported in 2017 that the trend of low-rise jeans, famous in 1990s and 2000s as sagging, was coming back in fashion due to celebrities like Justin Bieber endorsing it. Low-rise jeans are usually worn 2-3 inches or more below the navel.  Industrial production  File:Denim Fabric Storing.JPGHow denim fabric is stored in the factory.

Geography  √ñrnsk√∂ldsvik is situated near the northern end of the \\"High Coast\\", which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and has the third longest suspension bridge in Europe, the H√∂ga Kusten Bridge. The city is located around 100 km south of Ume√• and 550 km north of Stockholm. The area is dominated by forest, but it also contains minor areas of agriculture.  Population distribution (31 December 2005)  The municipality of √ñrnsk√∂ldsvik is built up from a number of parishes, within which are towns and villages. The population is distributed as follows: Parish (town) number of citizens * √ñrnsk√∂ldsvik: 9,123 * Arn√§s: 7,653 * Anundsj√∂: 4,100  Bredbyn: 1,216  Mellansel: 821 * Skorped: 667 * Sidensj√∂: 1,192 * N√§tra: 5,402  Bj√§sta: 1,777  K√∂pmanholmen: 1,263 * Sj√§levad: 18,960  Domsj√∂  Gull√§nget  Sund  Gene * Mo: 1,309 * Grundsunda: 3,214 * Gide√•: 1,215 * Bj√∂rna: 1,586 * Treh√∂rningsj√∂: 522 * Gottne: 250 Total: 54,943  Transportation  Main road transportations are provided by the European route E4.

Both cross- country skiing, alpine skiing and even ski jumping is practiced almost in the downtown area. Since √ñrnsk√∂ldsvik is a coastal town, there are also beaches near town, as well as campsites. There's also an indoor water park called Paradisbadet, with one of the longest water slides in Europe. Sports is also popular, the main spectator sport in town is ice hockey, with the local team Modo Hockey in Swedish Hockey League, the main league for ice hockey in Sweden. The local football teams are not quite as successful, but still pretty popular, on the men's side especially the teams Friska Viljor FC from central √ñrnsk√∂ldsvik and Anundsj√∂ IF from Bredbyn outside of town, and women's Sj√§levads IK.

The Latinized form of his surname, Stradivarius, as well as the colloquial Strad are terms often used to refer to his instruments. It is estimated that Stradivari produced 1,116 instruments, of which 960 were violins. Around 650 instruments survived, including 450 to 512 violins.  Biography   Family and early life  Panorama of Cremona, with the Torrazzo di Cremona prominent Antonio Stradivari's birthdate, presumably between 1644 and 1649, has been debated amongst historians due to the numerous inconsistencies in the evidence of the latter. The 1668 and 1678 censuses report him actually growing younger, a fact explained by the probable loss of statistics from 1647‚Äì49, when renewed belligerency between France's Modenese and Spain's Milanese proxies led to a flow of refugees that included Stradivari's mother. Stradivari's ancestry consisted of notable citizens of Cremona, dating back to at least the 12th or 13th century. The earliest mention of the family name, or a variation upon it, is in a land grant dating from 1188.Hill et al (1963), p. 3 The origin of the name itself has several possible explanations; some sources say it is the plural of stradivare, essentially meaning \\"toll-man\\" in Lombard, while others say that the form de Strataverta derives from , which in Cremonese dialect means \\"open road\\".Fuller-Maitland et al (1922), pp. 707‚Äì12 [707] Antonio's parents were Alessandro Stradivari, son of Giulio Cesare Stradivari, and Anna Moroni, daughter of Leonardo Moroni.Chapin, Anna Alice. The Heart of Music: The Story of the Violin. New York: Dodd, Mead and Co., 1921. 268. They married on 30 August 1622, and had at least three children between 1623 and 1628: Giuseppe Giulia Cesare, Carlo Felice, and Giovanni Battista. The baptismal records of the parish of S. Prospero then stop, and it is unknown whether they had any children from 1628 to 1644.Hill et al (1963), p. 4 This gap in the records may be due to the family leaving Cremona in response to war, famine, and plague in the city from 1628 to 1630,Hill et al (1963), p. 6 or the records may have been lost due to clerical reforms imposed by Joseph II of Austria in 1788.Pollens (2010), p. 11 The latter explanation is supported by the word Cremonensis (of Cremona) on many of Stradivari's labels, which suggests that he was born in the city instead of merely moving back there to work.Pollens (2010), p. 12 Antonio was born in 1644, a fact deducible from later violins.Faber (2006), p. 26 However, there are no records or information available on his early childhood, and the first evidence of his presence in Cremona is the label of his oldest surviving violin from 1666.Faber (2006) p. 25 Stradivari likely began an apprenticeship with Nicola Amati between the ages of 12 and 14,Hill et al (1963), p. 27 although a minor debate surrounds this fact. One of the few pieces of evidence supporting this is the label of his 1666 violin, which reads, Alumnus Nicolai Amati, faciebat anno 1666.Hill et al (1963), p. 26 However, Stradivari did not repeatedly put Amati's name on his labels, unlike many of Amati's other students.Hill et al (1963), p. 25 Stradivari's early violins actually bear less resemblance to Amati's than his later instruments do. M. Chanot-Chardon, a well-known French luthier, asserted that his father had a label of Stradivari's stating, \\"Made at the age of thirteen, in the workshop of Nicol√≤ Amati\\". This label has never been found or confirmed. Amati would also have been a logical choice for Antonio's parents, as he represented an old family of violin makers in Cremona, and was far superior to most other luthiers in Italy. Some researchers believe there is a closer educational association between Antonio Stradivari and Francesco Rugeri than has previously been recognized. Despite the long-held belief that Antonio Stradivari was the pupil of Nicol√≤ Amati, there are important discrepancies between their work. Some researchers believe early instruments by Stradivari bear a stronger resemblance to Francesco Rugeri's work than Amati's. Additionally, the utilization of a small dorsal pin or small hole, invariably used not just by Nicol√≤ Amati but all of his recognized pupils‚Äîwith the exception of Antonio Stradivari, adds further evidence that Stradivari may have learnt his craft apart from Amati. This pin or hole was fundamental in the graduation of the thickness of the plates and was obviously a technique passed on through generations of pupils of the Amati. This dorsal pin is also not found in any of the instruments of the Rugeri family, suggesting Antonio Stradivari may have actually learnt his craft from Francesco Rugeri, although both being influenced by Amati.Carlo Bergonzi: Alla scoperta di un grande Maestro by By Christopher Reuning W.E. Hill & Sons concede that they fail to find the hand of Stradivari in any of Nicolo Amati's work, although the unmistakable hands of Andrea Guarneri and Francesco Rugeri are evident. An alternative theory is that Stradivari started out as a woodworker: the house he lived in from 1667 to 1680 was owned by Francesco Pescaroli, a woodcarver and inlayer. Stradivari may even have been employed to decorate some of Amati's instruments, without being a true apprentice. This theory is supported by some of Stradivari's later violins, which have elaborate decorations and purfling.Faber (2006), p. 27 Assuming that Stradivari was a student of Amati, he would have begun his apprenticeship in 1656‚Äì58 and produced his first decent instruments in 1660, at the age of 16. His first labels were printed from 1660 to 1665, which indicates that his work had sufficient quality to be offered directly to his patrons. However, he probably stayed in Amati's workshop until about 1684, using his master's reputation as a launching point for his career.Hill et al (1963), p. 28  First marriage  Antonio Stradivari's second house, at No. 2 Piazza San Domenico Stradivari married his first wife, Francesca Ferraboschi, on 4 July 1667.Hill et al (1963), p. 8 Francesca was the young widow of the burgher Giacomo Capra, with whom she had two children. Francesca's brother had shot Giacomo with a crossbow on the Piazza Garibaldi (formerly the Piazza Santa Agata) in 1664. He was later exiled, though allowed to return to Cremona many years later.Faber (2006), p. 28 After their marriage, Stradivari moved into a house known as the Casa del Pescatore, or the Casa Nuziale, in his wife's parish. A clue to how they would have met lies in the 1659 Easter census, which lists the Ferraboschi family four houses away from the Amati residence. The couple had a daughter, Giulia Maria, three to four months later.Hill et al (1963), p. 10 They remained in the house until 1680, during which time they had four more children: Catterina, Francesco, Alessandro, and Omobono Stradivari, as well as an infant son who lived for only a week.Fuller-Maitland et al (1922), pp. 707‚Äì12 [708] An age difference of four to nine years was uncommon between wedded couples at the time. Stradivari purchased a house now known as No. 1 Piazza Roma (formerly No. 2 Piazza San Domenico) around 1680 for the sum of 7000 lire, 2000 of which he paid at the time of the purchase. The totality of the house was paid for by 1684. The residence was just doors away from those of several other violin-making families of Cremona, including the Amatis and Guarneris.Pollens (2010), p. 22 Stradivari probably worked in the loft and attic, and he stayed in this house for the rest of his life.Hill et al (1963), p. 12. A visit to the loft is described by H.R. Haweis, My Musical Life (1892), pp. 322‚Äì28. Stradivari's wife Francesca died on 20 May 1698, and received an elaborate funeral five days later.Pollens (2010), p. 26  Second marriage  Stradivari married his second wife, Antonia Maria Zambelli, on 24 August 1699. The only information known about her is that she was 35 at the time of the marriage. They had five children from 1700 to 1708‚ÄîFrancesca Maria, Giovanni Battista Giuseppe, Giovanni Battista Martino, Giuseppe Antonio, and Paolo.  Death  Stradivari died in Cremona on 18 December 1737, aged 93. He is buried in the Church of San Domenico.Faber (2006), p. 59 The tomb was acquired eight years prior to his death, having been bought from a Cremonese family, substituting his name for theirs in the tombstone.  Will  Stradivari generated substantial wealth in his lifetime. His will, dated 1729, counted eight living heirs, including his wife. Zambelli was left with her clothing, bed linens, household items, and half of her jewelry. Antonia would become the responsibility of his two eldest sons. Annunciata Caterina was left her jewelry, clothing, linens, and income on loans. Paolo, the youngest child, would get six finished violins‚Äîvalued at 1,000 lire‚Äîas well as some household effects and cash. Three other children who had joined religious orders were left with their share of inheritance: Maria, a nun, would get an annuity; Alessandro, a priest, would get fixed income on a home mortgage loan; and Giuseppe, another priest, would get some income on half a share from a pastry shop. There were also annual payments to his two sons of 150 and 300 lire each and 170 lire for Annunciata and 100 for Francesca.Shoenbaum, David, The Violin: A Social History of the World's Most Versatile Instrument, Norton, 2013, p. 30 His remaining two sons from his first marriage had both worked in the family shop. Omobono, who had left the dwelling aged eighteen in search of new employment possibilities in Naples, would inherit six violins, and Francesco, who was named his father's successor, would inherit the rest of the estate, including all of the tools, stencils, finished violins, patterns, and‚Äîostensibly‚Äîhis father's reputation.Shoenbaum, David, The Violin: A Social History of the World's Most Versatile Instrument, Norton, 2013, p. 31 In 1733, he had bought his youngest son a partnership in a local textile firm for the large amount of 25,000 lire.  Career   Early career  Stradivari probably developed his own style slowly. Some of his early violins were smaller, with notable exception to this is the 1679 Hellier violin, which had much larger proportions.Hill et al (1963), p. 33 Stradivari's early (pre-1684) violins are in strong contrast to Amati's instruments from the same time period; Stradivari's have a stronger, more masculine build, and less rounded curves, with the purfling set farther in.Hill et al (1963), p. 34Pollens (2010), p. 16 By 1680, Stradivari had acquired at least a small, yet growing, reputation. In 1682, a Venetian banker ordered a complete set of instruments, which he planned to present to King James II of England.Hill et al (1963) pp. 36‚Äì37 The fate of these instruments is unknown. Cosimo III de' Medici bought another five years later.Faber (2006), p. 41 Amati died in 1684, an event followed by a noticeable increase in Stradivari's production. The years 1684 and 1685 also marked an important development in his style‚Äîthe dimensions he used generally increased, and his instruments were more in the style of Amati's work of the 1640s and 1650s.Hill et al (1963), pp. 37‚Äì38 Stradivari's instruments underwent no major change in the next five years,Hill et al (1963), p. 39 although in 1688 he began cutting a more distinct bevel and began outlining the heads of instruments in black, a quite original improvement.Hill et al (1963), p. 40 Stradivari's early career is marked by wide experimentation, and his instruments during this period are generally considered of a lesser quality than his later work.Faber (2006), pp. 29‚Äì30 However, the precision with which he carved the heads and inserted the purfling quickly marked him as one of the most dextrous craftsmen in the world, a prime example of this being the 1690 \\"Tuscan\\" violin.Hill et al (1963), p. 41 Pre-1690 instruments are sometimes termed \\"Amatis√©\\" but this is not completely accurate; it is largely because Stradivari created many more instruments later on that people try to connect his early work with Amati's style.Petherick (1900), p. 13 By 1680 Stradivari moved to No. 1 Piazza Roma (formerly No. 2 Piazza San Domenico). The house was just doors away from those of several other violin making families of Cremona, including the Amatis and Guarneris. Stradivari probably worked in the loft and attic, and he lived in this house for the rest of his life.  \\"Golden\\" period and later years  In the early 1690s, Stradivari made a pronounced departure from this earlier style of instrument-making, changing two key elements of his instruments. First, he began to make violins with a larger pattern than previous instruments; these larger violins usually are known as \\"Long Strads\\".Hill et al (1963), p. 149 He also switched to using a darker, richer varnish, as opposed to a yellower varnish similar to that used by Amati.Hill et al (1963), p. 45 He continued to use this pattern until 1698, with few exceptions. After 1698, he abandoned the Long Strad model and returned to a slightly shorter model, which he used until his death. The period from 1700 until the 1720s is often termed the \\"golden period\\" of his production. Instruments made during this time are usually considered of a higher quality than his earlier instruments. Late-period instruments made from the late 1720s until his death in 1737 show signs of Stradivari's advancing age. These late instruments may be a bit less beautiful than the Golden Period instruments, but many nonetheless possess a fine tone. Heavier and looser craftmanship of the late Stradivari output can be seen in the 1734 'Habeneck'.  Stradivari and the Cremonese violin making school   Influence in the 18th century  The Stradivari parish, San Matteo, and the Amati parish, San Faustino, comprised the center of Cremonese violin making. They exerted influence on one another's shape, varnish and sound of instruments, but also on many of their contemporaries'; they defined violin making standards for the next 300 years. Even at the beginning of the 18th century, Stradivari's influence could be seen not only in the work of Cremonese makers, but also international ones, such as Barak Norman's, one of the first important British makers. In the 1720s Daniel Parker, a very important British luthier, produced fine violins after Stradivari's work selling anywhere from ¬£30,000 to ¬£60,000 in recent auctions. Parker based his best instruments on Stradivari's \\"long pattern\\", having the opportunity to study one or more of the instruments. Well into the 19th century, Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume, the leading French luthier of his time, also made many important copies of Strads and Guarneris. In the 18th century, Cremonese luthiers were the suppliers and local players on the demand side. After Stradivari's death, this drastically changed. Although the Cremonese luthiers remained the suppliers, the demand side now consisted mainly of collectors, researchers, imitators, profiteers, and speculators. Many local players could no longer afford the sought out instruments and most of the purchased instruments would be hidden in private collections, put in museums, or simply put back in their cases, hoping that they would gain value over time. This is when the Stradivari \\"fever\\" really took off. The violin collector Count Ignazio Alessandro Cozio di Salabue, Vuillaume, and later Tarisio Auctions have all contributed to this frenzy that would extend well into the 21st century. Also, most of the other major Cremonese luthiers died soon after Stradivari, putting an end to the golden period of Cremona's violin making, which lasted more than 150 years, starting with the Amatis and ending with the Cerutis. The Cremonese maker Vincenzo Rugeri (1663‚Äì1719), while staying true to the Grand Amati Pattern by Nicolo Amati, was influenced by Stradivari in that he adopted a somewhat lower arch consistent with Stradivarian ideals. Members of the Gagliano family such as Gennaro and Nicolo made excellent copies of the instruments in the 1740s, though the only similarity to Stradivari's instruments were the execution of the form and arching as well as consistently fine and detailed varnish. Nicolo would usually use the forma B model for his cellos and as the quality of the output steadily declined within the family, the Stradivari models were almost abandoned in Naples. Having acquired many Strads from Paolo Stradivari, Count Cozio commissioned Giovanni Battista Guadagnini to make some replicas of the instruments. Although many features of Strads are present in the copies, they still remain heavily influenced by Guadagnini's workshop principles and represent well the maker's Turin period. Vincenzo Panormo was also one of the many luthiers who based many of his violins on Strads. He learned about them in Paris between 1779 and 1789 when he worked closely with L√©opold Renaudin, another one of Strad's followers. Stradivari's influence could also be seen in Spain with the outstanding work of Jos√© Contreras of Granada and Madrid. Having the privilege to be exposed to Stradivari's instruments through the Spanish court, he was experienced enough to replace the scroll of a 1717 Stradivari cello and possibly even make its back and ribs. He had a great ability to imitate the original varnish and intricacy of the instrument.  Influence in the 19th and 20th century  The 19th century was not as eventful in comparison to the previous centuries. Some of the most important luthiers from this part of history include Giovanni Rota, as well as the two non-Italian makers Fran√ßois Chanot in France and the artist, inventor and musician William Sidney Mount in the US, who both created experimental violins. The 20th century was the so-called rebirth of Cremonese making, when luthiers such as Giuseppe Antonio Rocca, Giovanni Battista Morassi, Beltrami, and the Antoniazzi family emerged from a seemingly uneventful and experimental period. These makers, sometimes basing their early violins on Strads, would later on make their own models and would inspire each other's work. The Cremonese violin-making school  Stradivari and his sons  Even though Antonio had a very long working life, it is impossible for him to have crafted more than 1,000 instruments entirely by himself, meaning that his sons, Francesco and Omobono, as well as possibly a third son, must have been working on and off in his shop. It is known that having left the workshop at eighteen, Omobono made a few instruments on his own, such as the 'Blagrove' and another violin dating from 1732. On his side, Francesco made very few violins independently, such as the 1742 'Salabue' and 'Oliveira', spending his lifetime in his father's shop. This was one of the main reasons that Francesco had a large part in Antonio's will, and Omobono a lesser one. One of the major differences between Antonio and his sons' craftsmanship was the quality of the purfling on their instruments, which in the case of Francesco and Omobono has been referred to as \\"startlingly poor\\". \\"Only a handful of instruments are reliably attributed to Francesco alone. ... [There are only] two authentic labels known: 'Franciscus Stradivarius Cremonensis / Filius Antonii faciebat Anno 1742' ... Notably it omits the A+S stamp that occurs on Antonio's labels. Another label states 'Sotto la Disciplina d'Antonio / Stradivari F. in Cremona 1737'. This is of course the year of his father's death, and the phrase 'sotto la disciplina', although it appears in a few other instruments, may here be a particular sign of his respect.\\"  Stradivarius instruments  Antonio Stradivari, by Edgar Bundy, 1893: a romanticized image of a craftsman-hero The Hills Violin Shop estimates that Stradivari produced 1,116 instruments, of which 960 were violins. It is also estimated that around 650 of these instruments survive, including 450 to 512 violins. Stradivari's instruments are regarded as amongst the finest bowed stringed instruments ever created, are highly prized, and are still played by professionals today. Only one other maker, Giuseppe Guarneri del Ges√π, commands a similar respect among violinists. However, neither blind listening tests nor acoustic analysis have ever demonstrated that Stradivarius instruments are better than other high- quality instruments or even reliably distinguishable from them.\\"Violinists can't tell the difference between Stradivarius violins and new ones\\" by Ed Yong, Discover, 2 January 2012. While the usual label for a Stradivarius instrument, whether genuine or false, uses the traditional Latin inscription, after the McKinley Tariff Act of 1890, copies were also inscribed with the country of origin. Since thousands of instruments are based on Stradivari's models and bear the same name as his models, many unwary people are deceived into purchasing forged Stradivarius instruments, which can be avoided by authenticating the instrument. Some violinists and cellists use Stradivari instruments in their work.

On 2 April 2007, Christie's sold a Stradivari violin, the 1729 Solomon, Ex-Lambert, for more than $2.7 million to an anonymous bidder in the auction house's fine musical instruments sale. Its price, US$2,728,000 including Christie's commission, far outdid its estimated value: $1 million to $1.5 million. On 14 October 2010, a 1697 Stradivari violin known as \\"The Molitor\\" was sold online by Tarisio Auctions for a world-record price of $3,600,000 to violinist Anne Akiko Meyers: at the time its price was the highest for any musical instrument sold at auction. On 21 June 2011, the Lady Blunt Stradivarius, a 1721 violin, was auctioned by Tarisio to an anonymous bidder for almost ¬£10 million, with all proceeds going to help the victims of the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. This was over four times the previous auction record for a Stradivari violin. The Baron von der Leyen Strad was auctioned by Tarisio on 26 April 2012, for $2.6 million. Publicly displayed collections of Stradivari instruments are those of: *the Library of Congress with three violins, a viola, and a cello *the Spanish royal collection with five instruments (an undecorated cello plus a quartet of decorated instruments: two violins, the Spanish I and II, the Spanish Court cello, and the Spanish Court viola) exhibited at the Royal Palace of Madrid (Palacio Real de Madrid) *London's Royal Academy of Music (Royal Academy of Music Museum) with several instruments by Antonio Stradivari, including the Joachim (1698), Rutson (1694), the Crespi (1699), Viotti ex-Bruce (1709), Kustendyke (1699), Maurin (1718) and the Ex Back (1666) violins, Ex Kux (1714), and the Archinto (1696) violas, the Marquis de Corberon (1726) and the Markevitch (1709) celli. *the Mus√©e de la musique in Paris displays several beautiful Stradivari instruments that formerly belonged to the Paris Conservatory.

The nature of the brain damage determines the severity, and the absence of sensory loss or paralysis helps to explain the level of difficulty.ASHA Some children may be born with apraxia although the cause is unknown. Symptoms are usually noticed in the early stages of life as the child develops. Apraxia that results from a brain injury or a neurodegenerative illness is known as acquired apraxia. Acquired apraxia is typically caused by a traumatic brain injury, stroke, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, brain tumor, and other neurodegenerative disorders. There are multiple types of apraxia and are categorized by what specific ability or body part is affected. The term comes from the Greek ·ºÄ- a- (\\"without\\") and œÄœÅ·æ∂ŒæŒπœÇ praxis (\\"action\\"). Types There are several types of apraxia including: *Apraxia of speech (AOS): Difficulty planning and coordinating the movements necessary for speech (e.g. Potato=Totapo, Topato).Heilman KM, Watson RT, Gonzalez-Rothi LJ. Praxis. In: Goetz CG. Goetz: Textbook of Clinical Neurology. 3rd ed. Philadelphia, PA: Saunders Elsevier; 2007:chap 4. AOS can independently occur without issues in areas such as verbal comprehension, reading comprehension, writing, articulation or prosody. *Buccofacial or orofacial apraxia: This is the most common type of apraxia and is the inability to carry out facial movements on demand. For example, an inability to lick one's lips, wink, or whistle when requested to do so. This suggests an inability to carry out volitional movements of the tongue, cheeks, lips, pharynx, or larynx on command. *Constructional apraxia: The inability to draw, construct, or copy simple configurations, such as intersecting shapes. These patients have difficulty copying a simple diagram or drawing basic shapes. *Gait apraxia: The loss of ability to have normal function of the lower limbs such as walking. This is not due to loss of motor or sensory functions. *Ideational/conceptual apraxia: Patients have an inability to conceptualize a task and impaired ability to complete multistep actions. This form of apraxia consists of an inability to select and carry out an appropriate motor program. For example, the patient may complete actions in incorrect orders, such as buttering bread before putting it in the toaster, or putting on shoes before putting on socks. There is also a loss of ability to voluntarily perform a learned task when given the necessary objects or tools. For instance, if given a screwdriver, the patient may try to write with it as if it were a pen, or try to comb their hair with a toothbrush. *Ideomotor apraxia: These patients have deficits in their ability to plan or complete motor actions that rely on semantic memory. They are able to explain how to perform an action, but unable to \\"imagine\\" or act out a movement such as \\"pretend to brush your teeth\\" or \\"pucker as though you bit into a sour lemon.\\" However, when the ability to perform an action automatically when cued remains intact, this is known as automatic-voluntary dissociation. For example, they may not be able to pick up a phone when asked to do so, but can perform the action without thinking when the phone rings. *Limb-kinetic apraxia: The inability to perform precise, voluntary movements of extremities. For example, a person affected by limb apraxia may have difficulty waving hello, tying their shoes, or typing on a computer.Treatment Resource Manual for Speech Pathology 5th edition This type is common in patients who have experienced a stroke, some type of brain trauma, or have Alzheimer disease. *Oculomotor apraxia: Difficulty moving the eye on command, especially with saccade movements that direct the gaze to targets. This is one of the 3 major components of Balint's syndrome. Causes Apraxia is most often due to a lesion located in the dominant (usually left) hemisphere of the brain, typically in the frontal and parietal lobes. Lesions may be due to stroke, acquired brain injuries, or neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or other dementias, Parkinson's disease, or Huntington's disease. It is also possible for apraxia to be caused by lesions in other areas of the brain. Ideomotor apraxia is typically due to a decrease in blood flow to the dominant hemisphere of the brain and particularly the parietal and premotor areas. It is frequently seen in patients with corticobasal degeneration. Ideational apraxia has been observed in patients with lesions in the dominant hemisphere near areas associated with aphasia; however, more research is needed on ideational apraxia due to brain lesions. The localization of lesions in areas of the frontal and temporal lobes would provide explanation for the difficulty in motor planning seen in ideational apraxia as well as its difficulty to distinguish it from certain aphasias. Constructional apraxia is often caused by lesions of the inferior non-dominant parietal lobe, and can be caused by brain injury, illness, tumor or other condition that can result in a brain lesion. Diagnosis Although qualitative and quantitative studies exist, there is little consensus on the proper method to assess for apraxia. The criticisms of past methods include failure to meet standard psychometric properties as well as research-specific designs that translate poorly to non- research use. The Test to Measure Upper Limb Apraxia (TULIA) is one method of determining upper limb apraxia through the qualitative and quantitative assessment of gesture production. In contrast to previous publications on apraxic assessment, the reliability and validity of TULIA was thoroughly investigated. The TULIA consists of subtests for the imitation and pantomime of non-symbolic (‚Äúput your index finger on top of your nose‚Äù), intransitive (‚Äúwave goodbye‚Äù) and transitive (‚Äúshow me how to use a hammer‚Äù) gestures. Discrimination (differentiating between well- and poorly performed tasks) and recognition (indicating which object corresponds to a pantomimed gesture) tasks are also often tested for a full apraxia evaluation. However, there may not be a strong correlation between formal test results and actual performance in everyday functioning or activities of daily living (ADLs). A comprehensive assessment of apraxia should include formal testing, standardized measurements of ADLs, observation of daily routines, self-report questionnaires and targeted interviews with the patients and their relatives. As stated above, apraxia should not be confused with aphasia (the inability to understand language); however, they frequently occur together. It has been stated that apraxia is so often accompanied by aphasia that many believe that if a person displays AOS then it should be assumed that the patient also has some level of aphasia.(Manasco, 2014) Treatment Treatment for individuals with apraxia includes speech therapy, occupational therapy, and physical therapy. Currently there are no medications indicated for the treatment of apraxia, only therapy treatments. Generally, treatments for apraxia have received little attention for several reasons, including the tendency for the condition to resolve spontaneously in acute cases. Additionally, the very nature of the automatic- voluntary dissociation of motor abilities that defines apraxia means that patients may still be able to automatically perform activities if cued to do so in daily life. Nevertheless, research shows that patients experiencing apraxia have less functional independence in their daily lives, and that evidence for the treatment of apraxia is scarce. However, a literature review of apraxia treatment to date reveals that although the field is in its early stages of treatment design, certain aspects can be included to treat apraxia. One method is through rehabilitative treatment, which has been found to positively impact apraxia, as well as activities of daily living. In this review, rehabilitative treatment consisted of 12 different contextual cues, which were used in order to teach patients how to produce the same gesture under different contextual situations. Additional studies have also recommended varying forms of gesture therapy, whereby the patient is instructed to make gestures (either using objects or symbolically meaningful and non-meaningful gestures) with progressively less cuing from the therapist. It may be necessary for patients with apraxia to use a form of alternative and augmentative communication depending on the severity of the disorder. In addition to using gestures as mentioned, patients can also use communication boards or more sophisticated electronic devices if needed. No single type of therapy or approach has been proven as the best way to treat a patient with apraxia, since each patient's case varies. However, one-on-one sessions usually work the best, with the support of family members and friends. Since everyone responds to therapy differently, some patients will make significant improvements, while others will make less progress. The overall goal for treatment of apraxia is to treat the motor plans for speech, not treating at the phoneme (sound) level. Research suggests that individuals with apraxia of speech should receive treatment that focuses on the repetition of target words and rate of speech. Research rerouted that the overall goal for treatment of apraxia should be to improve speech intelligibility, rate of speech and articulation of targeted words. Prognosis The prognosis for individuals with apraxia varies. With therapy, some patients improve significantly, while others may show very little improvement. Some individuals with apraxia may benefit from the use of a communication aid. However, many people with apraxia are no longer able to be independent. Those with limb-kinetic and/or gait apraxia should avoid activities in which they might injure themselves or others. Occupational therapy, physical therapy, and play therapy may be considered as other references to support patients with apraxia. These team members could work along with the SLP to provide the best therapy for people with apraxia. However, because people with limb apraxia may have trouble directing their motor movements, occupational therapy for stroke or other brain injury can be difficult. No medication has been shown useful for treating apraxia.

It is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme aminoacylase 2, and is one of a group of genetic diseases referred to as leukodystrophies. It is characterized by degeneration of myelin in the phospholipid layer insulating the axon of a neuron and is associated with a gene located on human chromosome 17. Symptoms and signs Symptoms of the most common (and most serious) form of Canavan disease typically appear in early infancy usually between the first three to six months of age. Canavan disease then progresses rapidly from that stage, with typical cases involving intellectual disability, loss of previously acquired motor skills, feeding difficulties, abnormal muscle tone (i.e., initial floppiness - hypotonia - that may eventually translate into spasticity), poor head control, and megalocephaly (abnormally enlarged head). Paralysis, blindness, or seizures may also occur. There exists a much less common variant of Canavan disease which is generally much less serious, and involves later onset of symptoms, which are often mild and nonspecific enough to go unrecognized as manifestations of Canavan's disease. This variant does not seem to have any effect on lifespan, and is typically limited to minor cases of speech and motor skill development delay. Pathophysiology Canavan disease has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Canavan disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. When both parents are carriers, the chance of having an affected child is 25%. Genetic counseling and genetic testing are recommended for families with two parental carriers. Canavan disease is caused by a defective ASPA gene which is responsible for the production of the enzyme aspartoacylase. Decreased aspartoacylase activity prevents the normal breakdown of N-acetyl aspartate, wherein the accumulation of N-acetylaspartate, or lack of its further metabolism interferes with growth of the myelin sheath of the nerve fibers of the brain. The myelin sheath is the fatty covering that surrounds nerve cells and acts as an insulator, allowing for efficient transmission of nerve impulses. Diagnosis The diagnosis of neonatal/infantile Canavan disease relies on demonstration of very high concentration of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in the urine. In mild/juvenile Canavan disease, NAA may only be slightly elevated; thus, the diagnosis relies on molecular genetic testing of ASPA, the gene encoding the enzyme aspartoacylase. Treatment No cure for Canavan disease is known, nor is there a standard course of treatment. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Physical therapy may help improve motor skills, and educational programs may help improve communication skills. Seizures are treated with antiepileptic drugs and gastrostomy is used to help maintain adequate food intake and hydration when swallowing difficulties exist. Also, an experimental treatment uses lithium citrate. When a person has Canavan disease, his or her levels of N-acetyl aspartate are chronically elevated. The lithium citrate has proven in a rat genetic model of Canavan disease to be able to significantly decrease levels of N-acetyl aspartate. When tested on a human, the subject's condition reversed during a 2-week wash-out period after withdrawal of lithium. The investigation revealed both decreased N-acetyl aspartate levels in regions of the brain tested and magnetic resonance spectroscopic values that are more characteristic of normal development and myelination. This evidence suggests that a larger controlled trial of lithium may be warranted as supportive therapy for children with Canavan disease. Experimental gene therapy trial results, published in 2002, used a healthy gene to take over for the defective one that causes Canavan disease. In human trials, the results of which were published in 2012, this method appeared to improve the life of the patient without long-term adverse effects during a 5-year follow-up. Prognosis The more common and serious version of Canavan disease typically results in death or development of life-threatening conditions by the age of ten, though life expectancy is variable, and is highly dependent on specific circumstances. On the other hand, the milder variants of the disorder seem not to have any effect on lifespan. Prevalence Although Canavan disease may occur in any ethnic group, it mostly affects people of Eastern European Jewish ancestry with about one in 40 (2.5%) individuals of Eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish ancestry being a carrier.  History  Canavan disease was first described in 1931 by Myrtelle Canavan. In 1931, she co-wrote a paper discussing the case of a child who had died at 16 months old and whose brain had a spongy white section. Canavan was the first to identify this degenerative disorder of the central nervous system, which was later named \\"Canavan disease\\".Dr. Myrtelle May Canavan National Library of Medicine: Changing the Face of Medicine: Physicians. Accessed July 21, 2009. Lawsuit The discovery of the gene for Canavan disease, and subsequent events, generated considerable controversy. In 1987, the Greenbergs, a family with two children affected by Canavan disease, donated tissue samples to Reuben Matalon, a researcher at the University of Chicago, who was looking for the Canavan gene. He successfully identified the gene in 1993, and developed a test for it that would enable antenatal (before birth) counseling of couples at risk of having a child with the disease. For a while, the Canavan Foundation offered free genetic testing using Matalon's test. However, in 1997, after he relocated to Florida, Matalon's new employer, Miami Children's Hospital, patented the gene and started claiming royalties on the genetic test, forcing the Canavan Foundation to withdraw their free testing. A subsequent lawsuit brought by the Canavan Foundation against Miami Children's Hospital was resolved with a sealed out- of-court settlement. The case is sometimes cited in arguments about the appropriateness of patenting genes. Research Research involving triacetin supplementation has shown promise in a rat model. Triacetin, which can be enzymatically cleaved to form acetate, enters the brain more readily than the negatively charged acetate. The defective enzyme in Canavan disease, aspartoacylase, converts N-acetylaspartate into aspartate and acetate. Mutations in the gene for aspartoacylase prevent the breakdown of N-acetylaspartate, and reduce brain acetate availability during brain development. Acetate supplementation using triacetin is meant to provide the missing acetate so brain development can continue normally. A team of researchers headed by Paola Leone at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, has tried a procedure involving the insertion of six catheters into the brain that deliver a solution containing 600 to 900 billion engineered virus particles.

The main symptoms are pain, numbness and tingling in the thumb, index finger, middle finger and the thumb side of the ring finger. Symptoms typically start gradually and during the night. Pain may extend up the arm. Weak grip strength may occur, and after a long period of time the muscles at the base of the thumb may waste away. In most cases, both hands are affected. Risk factors include obesity, repetitive wrist work, pregnancy, genetics, and rheumatoid arthritis. There is tentative evidence that hypothyroidism increases the risk. Diabetes mellitus is weakly associated with CTS. The use of birth control pills does not affect the risk. Types of work that are associated include computer work, work with vibrating tools and work that requires a strong grip. Diagnosis is suspected based on signs, symptoms and specific physical tests and may be confirmed with electrodiagnostic tests. If muscle wasting at the base of the thumb is present, the diagnosis is likely. Being physically active can decrease the risk of developing CTS. Symptoms can be improved by wearing a wrist splint or with corticosteroid injections. Taking NSAIDs or gabapentin does not appear to be useful. Surgery to cut the transverse carpal ligament is effective with better results at a year compared to non-surgical options. Further splinting after surgery is not needed. Evidence does not support magnet therapy. About 5% of people in the United States have carpal tunnel syndrome. It usually begins in adulthood, and women are more commonly affected than men. Up to 33% of people may improve without specific treatment over approximately a year. Carpal tunnel syndrome was first fully described after World War II. Signs and symptoms People with CTS experience numbness, tingling, or burning sensations in the thumb and fingers, in particular the index and middle fingers and radial half of the ring finger, because these receive their sensory and motor function (muscle control) from the median nerve. Ache and discomfort can possibly be felt more proximally in the forearm or even the upper arm. Page last reviewed: 18/09/2014 Less-specific symptoms may include pain in the wrists or hands, loss of grip strength, and loss of manual dexterity. Some suggest that median nerve symptoms can arise from compression at the level of the thoracic outlet or the area where the median nerve passes between the two heads of the pronator teres in the forearm, although this is debated. Numbness and paresthesias in the median nerve distribution are the hallmark neuropathic symptoms (NS) of carpal tunnel entrapment syndrome. Weakness and atrophy of the thumb muscles may occur if the condition remains untreated, because the muscles are not receiving sufficient nerve stimulation. Discomfort is usually worse at night and in the morning. Causes Anatomy of the carpal tunnel, showing the median nerve passing through the tight space it shares with the finger tendons Most cases of CTS are of unknown cause. Risk factors include obesity, repetitive wrist work, pregnancy, genetics, and rheumatoid arthritis. There is tentative evidence that hypothyroidism increases the risk. Diabetes mellitus is weakly associated with CTS. The use of birth control pills does not affect the risk. Types of work that are associated include computer work, work with vibrating tools and work that requires a strong grip. Trauma may also place a role, as may genetics. Carpal tunnel is a feature of a form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome type 1 called hereditary neuropathy with susceptibility to pressure palsies. Other causes of this condition include intrinsic factors that exert pressure within the tunnel, and extrinsic factors (pressure exerted from outside the tunnel), which include benign tumors such as lipomas, ganglion, and vascular malformation. Severe carpal tunnel syndrome often is a symptom of transthyretin amyloidosis-associated polyneuropathy and prior carpal tunnel syndrome surgery is very common in individuals who later present with transthyretin amyloid-associated cardiomyopathy, suggesting that transthyretin amyloid deposition may cause carpal tunnel syndrome in these people. The median nerve can usually move up to 9.6 mm to allow the wrist to flex, and to a lesser extent during extension. Long-term compression of the median nerve can inhibit nerve gliding, which may lead to injury and scarring. When scarring occurs, the nerve will adhere to the tissue around it and become locked into a fixed position, so that less movement is apparent. Normal pressure of the carpal tunnel has been defined as a range of 2‚Äì10 mm, and wrist flexion increases this pressure 8-fold, while extension increases it 10-fold. Repetitive flexion and extension in the wrist significantly increase the fluid pressure in the tunnel through thickening of the synovial tissue that lines the tendons within the carpal tunnel. Genetics Genetic factors are believed to be the most important determinants of who develops carpal tunnel syndrome. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of carpal tunnel syndrome identified 16 genomic loci significantly associated with the disease, including several loci previously known to be associated with human height. Work related The international debate regarding the relationship between CTS and repetitive motion in work is ongoing. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has adopted rules and regulations regarding cumulative trauma disorders. Occupational risk factors of repetitive tasks, force, posture, and vibration have been cited. The relationship between work and CTS is controversial; in many locations, workers diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome are entitled to time off and compensation. Some speculate that carpal tunnel syndrome is provoked by repetitive movement and manipulating activities and that the exposure can be cumulative. It has also been stated that symptoms are commonly exacerbated by forceful and repetitive use of the hand and wrists in industrial occupations, but it is unclear as to whether this refers to pain (which may not be due to carpal tunnel syndrome) or the more typical numbness symptoms. A review of available scientific data by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) indicated that job tasks that involve highly repetitive manual acts or specific wrist postures were associated with incidents of CTS, but causation was not established, and the distinction from work-related arm pains that are not carpal tunnel syndrome was not clear. It has been proposed that repetitive use of the arm can affect the biomechanics of the upper limb or cause damage to tissues. It has also been proposed that postural and spinal assessment along with ergonomic assessments should be included in the overall determination of the condition. Addressing these factors has been found to improve comfort in some studies. A 2010 survey by NIOSH showed that 2/3 of the 5 million carpal tunnel cases in the US that year were related to work. Women have more work- related carpal tunnel syndrome than men. Speculation that CTS is work-related is based on claims such as CTS being found mostly in the working adult population, though evidence is lacking for this. For instance, in one recent representative series of a consecutive experience, most patients were older and not working. Based on the claimed increased incidence in the workplace, arm use is implicated, but the weight of evidence suggests that this is an inherent, genetic, slowly but inevitably progressive idiopathic peripheral mononeuropathy. Associated conditions A variety of patient factors can lead to CTS, including heredity, size of the carpal tunnel, associated local and systematic diseases, and certain habits. Non-traumatic causes generally happen over a period of time, and are not triggered by one certain event. Many of these factors are manifestations of physiologic aging. Examples include: * Rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases that cause inflammation of the flexor tendons. * With hypothyroidism, generalized myxedema causes deposition of mucopolysaccharides within both the perineurium of the median nerve, as well as the tendons passing through the carpal tunnel. * During pregnancy, women commonly experience CTS due to hormonal changes (high progesterone levels) and water retention, which swells the synovium * Previous injuries including fractures of the wrist. * Medical disorders that lead to fluid retention or are associated with inflammation such as: inflammatory arthritis, Colles' fracture, amyloidosis, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, acromegaly, and use of corticosteroids and estrogens. * Carpal tunnel syndrome is also associated with repetitive activities of the hand and wrist, in particular with a combination of forceful and repetitive activities * Acromegaly causes excessive secretion of growth hormones. This causes the soft tissues and bones around the carpel tunnel to grow and compress the median nerve. * Tumors (usually benign), such as a ganglion or a lipoma, can protrude into the carpal tunnel, reducing the amount of space. This is exceedingly rare (less than 1%). * Obesity also increases the risk of CTS: individuals classified as obese (BMI > 29) are 2.5 times more likely than slender individuals (BMI < 20) to be diagnosed with CTS. * Double-crush syndrome is a debated hypothesis that compression or irritation of nerve branches contributing to the median nerve in the neck, or anywhere above the wrist, increases sensitivity of the nerve to compression in the wrist. There is little evidence, however, that this syndrome really exists. * Heterozygous mutations in the gene SH3TC2, associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth, confer susceptibility to neuropathy, including the carpal tunnel syndrome. Pathophysiology Transverse section at the wrist. The median nerve is colored yellow. The carpal tunnel consists of the bones and transverse carpal ligament. The carpal tunnel is an anatomical compartment located at the base of the palm. Nine flexor tendons and the median nerve pass through the carpal tunnel that is surrounded on three sides by the carpal bones that form an arch. The median nerve provides feeling or sensation to the thumb, index finger, long finger, and half of the ring finger. At the level of the wrist, the median nerve supplies the muscles at the base of the thumb that allow it to abduct, move away from the other four fingers, as well as move out of the plane of the palm. The carpal tunnel is located at the middle third of the base of the palm, bounded by the bony prominence of the scaphoid tubercle and trapezium at the base of the thumb, and the hamate hook that can be palpated along the axis of the ring finger. From the anatomical position, the carpal tunnel is bordered on the anterior surface by the transverse carpal ligament, also known as the flexor retinaculum. The flexor retinaculum is a strong, fibrous band that attaches to the pisiform and the hamulus of the hamate. The proximal boundary is the distal wrist skin crease, and the distal boundary is approximated by a line known as Kaplan's cardinal line. This line uses surface landmarks, and is drawn between the apex of the skin fold between the thumb and index finger to the palpated hamate hook. The median nerve can be compressed by a decrease in the size of the canal, an increase in the size of the contents (such as the swelling of lubrication tissue around the flexor tendons), or both. Since the carpal tunnel is bordered by carpal bones on one side and a ligament on the other, when the pressure builds up inside the tunnel, there is nowhere for it to escape and thus it ends up pressing up against and damaging the median nerve. Simply flexing the wrist to 90 degrees will decrease the size of the canal. Compression of the median nerve as it runs deep to the transverse carpal ligament (TCL) causes atrophy of the thenar eminence, weakness of the flexor pollicis brevis, opponens pollicis, abductor pollicis brevis, as well as sensory loss in the digits supplied by the median nerve. The superficial sensory branch of the median nerve, which provides sensation to the base of the palm, branches proximal to the TCL and travels superficial to it. Thus, this branch spared in carpal tunnel syndrome, and there is no loss of palmar sensation. Diagnosis There is no consensus reference standard for the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. A combination of described symptoms, clinical findings, and electrophysiological testing may be used. Correct diagnosis involves identifying if symptoms matches the distribution pattern of the median nerve (which does not normally include the 5th digit). CTS work up is the most common referral to the electrodiagnostic lab. Historically, diagnosis has been made with the combination of a thorough history and physical examination in conjunction with the use of electrodiagnostic (EDX) testing for confirmation. Additionally, evolving technology has included the use of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of CTS. However, it is well established that physical exam provocative maneuvers lack both sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, EDX cannot fully exclude the diagnosis of CTS due to the lack of sensitivity. A Joint report published by the American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagostic Medicine (AANEM), the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (AAPM&R;) and the American Academy of Neurology defines practice parameters, standards and guidelines for EDX studies of CTS based on an extensive critical literature review. This joint review concluded median and sensory nerve conduction studies are valid and reproducible in a clinical laboratory setting and a clinical diagnosis of CTS can be made with a sensitivity greater than 85% and specificity greater than 95%. Given the key role of electrodiagnostic testing in the diagnosis of CTS, The American Association of Neuromuscular & Electrodiagnostic Medicine has issued evidence-based practice guidelines, both for the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. Numbness in the distribution of the median nerve, nocturnal symptoms, thenar muscle weakness/atrophy, positive Tinel's sign at the carpal tunnel, and abnormal sensory testing such as two-point discrimination have been standardized as clinical diagnostic criteria by consensus panels of experts. Pain may also be a presenting symptom, although less common than sensory disturbances. Electrodiagnostic testing (electromyography and nerve conduction velocity) can objectively verify the median nerve dysfunction. Normal nerve conduction studies, however, do not exclude the diagnosis of CTS. Clinical assessment by history taking and physical examination can support a diagnosis of CTS. If clinical suspicion of CTS is high, treatment should be initiated despite normal electrodiagnostic testing. Physical exam Although widely used, the presence of a positive Phalen test, Tinel sign, Flick sign, or upper limb nerve test alone is not sufficient for diagnosis. * Phalen's maneuver is performed by flexing the wrist gently as far as possible, then holding this position and awaiting symptoms. A positive test is one that results in numbness in the median nerve distribution when holding the wrist in acute flexion position within sixty seconds. The quicker the numbness starts, the more advanced the condition. Phalen's sign is defined as pain or paresthesias in the median-innervated fingers with one minute of wrist flexion. Only this test has been shown to correlate with CTS severity when studied prospectively. The test characteristics of Phalen's maneuver have varied across studies ranging from 42‚Äì85% sensitivity and 54‚Äì98% specificity. * Tinel's sign is a classic test to detect median nerve irritation. Tinel's sign is performed by lightly tapping the skin over the flexor retinaculum to elicit a sensation of tingling or \\"pins and needles\\" in the median nerve distribution. Tinel's sign (pain or paresthesias of the median-innervated fingers with percussion over the median nerve), depending on the study, has 38‚Äì100% sensitivity and 55‚Äì100% specificity for the diagnosis of CTS. * Durkan test, carpal compression test, or applying firm pressure to the palm over the nerve for up to 30 seconds to elicit symptoms has also been proposed. * Hand elevation test The hand elevation test is performed by lifting both hands above the head, and if symptoms are reproduced in the median nerve distribution within 2 minutes, considered positive. The hand elevation test has higher sensitivity and specificity than Tinel's test, Phalen's test, and carpal compression test. Chi-square statistical analysis has shown the hand elevation test to be as effective, if not better than, Tinel's test, Phalen's test, and carpal compression test. As a note, a person with true carpal tunnel syndrome (entrapment of the median nerve within the carpal tunnel) will not have any sensory loss over the thenar eminence (bulge of muscles in the palm of hand and at the base of the thumb). This is because the palmar branch of the median nerve, which innervates that area of the palm, branches off of the median nerve and passes over the carpal tunnel. This feature of the median nerve can help separate carpal tunnel syndrome from thoracic outlet syndrome, or pronator teres syndrome. Other conditions may also be misdiagnosed as carpal tunnel syndrome. Thus, if history and physical examination suggest CTS, patients will sometimes be tested electrodiagnostically with nerve conduction studies and electromyography. The role of confirmatory nerve conduction studies is controversial. The goal of electrodiagnostic testing is to compare the speed of conduction in the median nerve with conduction in other nerves supplying the hand. When the median nerve is compressed, as in CTS, it will conduct more slowly than normal and more slowly than other nerves. There are many electrodiagnostic tests used to make a diagnosis of CTS, but the most sensitive, specific, and reliable test is the Combined Sensory Index (also known as the Robinson index). Electrodiagnosis rests upon demonstrating impaired median nerve conduction across the carpal tunnel in context of normal conduction elsewhere. Compression results in damage to the myelin sheath and manifests as delayed latencies and slowed conduction velocities However, normal electrodiagnostic studies do not preclude the presence of carpal tunnel syndrome, as a threshold of nerve injury must be reached before study results become abnormal and cut-off values for abnormality are variable. Carpal tunnel syndrome with normal electrodiagnostic tests is very, very mild at worst. Imaging The role of MRI or ultrasound imaging in the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome is unclear. Their routine use is not recommended. MRI has high sensitivity but low specificity to CTS. High signal intensity would show accumulation of axonal transportation, myelin sheath degeneration or oedema. Differential diagnosis There are few disorders on the differential diagnosis for carpal tunnel syndrome. Cervical radiculopathy can be mistaken for carpal tunnel syndrome since it can also cause abnormal or painful sensations in the hands and wrist. In contrast to carpal tunnel syndrome, the symptoms of cervical radiculopathy usually begins in the neck and travels down the affected arm and may be worsened by neck movement. Electromyography and imaging of the cervical spine can help to differentiate cervical radiculopathy from carpal tunnel syndrome if the diagnosis is unclear. Carpal tunnel syndrome is sometimes applied as a label to anyone with pain, numbness, swelling, or burning in the radial side of the hands or wrists. When pain is the primary symptom, carpal tunnel syndrome is unlikely to be the source of the symptoms. As a whole, the medical community is not currently embracing or accepting trigger point theories due to lack of scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness. Prevention There is little or no data to support the concept that activity adjustment prevents carpal tunnel syndrome. The evidence for wrist rest is debated. There is also little research supporting that ergonomics is related to CTS. Due to risk factors for hand and wrist dysfunction being multifactorial and very complex it is difficult to assess the true physical factors of CTS. Biological factors such as genetic predisposition and anthropometric features had significantly stronger causal association with carpal tunnel syndrome than occupational/environmental factors such as repetitive hand use and stressful manual work. This suggests that carpal tunnel syndrome might not be preventable simply by avoiding certain activities or types of work/activities. Treatment Generally accepted treatments include: physiotherapy, steroids either orally or injected locally, splinting, and surgical release of the transverse carpal ligament. Limited evidence suggests that gabapentin is no more effective than placebo for CTS treatment. There is insufficient evidence for therapeutic ultrasound, yoga, acupuncture, low level laser therapy, vitamin B6, and exercise. Change in activity may include avoiding activities that worsen symptoms. The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons recommends proceeding conservatively with a course of nonsurgical therapies tried before release surgery is considered. A different treatment should be tried if the current treatment fails to resolve the symptoms within 2 to 7 weeks. Early surgery with carpal tunnel release is indicated where there is evidence of median nerve denervation or a person elects to proceed directly to surgical treatment. Recommendations may differ when carpal tunnel syndrome is found in association with the following conditions: diabetes mellitus, coexistent cervical radiculopathy, hypothyroidism, polyneuropathy, pregnancy, rheumatoid arthritis, and carpal tunnel syndrome in the workplace. Splints A rigid splint can keep the wrist straight A different type of rigid splint used in carpal tunnel syndrome. The importance of wrist braces and splints in the carpal tunnel syndrome therapy is known, but many people are unwilling to use braces. In 1993, The American Academy of Neurology recommend a non-invasive treatment for the CTS at the beginning (except for sensitive or motor deficit or grave report at EMG/ENG): a therapy using splints was indicated for light and moderate pathology. Current recommendations generally don't suggest immobilizing braces, but instead activity modification and non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs as initial therapy, followed by more aggressive options or specialist referral if symptoms do not improve. Many health professionals suggest that, for the best results, one should wear braces at night. When possible, braces can be worn during the activity primarily causing stress on the wrists. The brace should not generally be used during the day as wrist activity is needed to keep the wrist from becoming stiff and to prevent muscles from weakening. Corticosteroids Corticosteroid injections can be effective for temporary relief from symptoms while a person develops a long- term strategy that fits their lifestyle. This form of treatment is thought to reduce discomfort in those with CTS due to its ability to decrease median nerve swelling. The use of ultrasound while performing the injection is more expensive but leads to faster resolution of CTS symptoms. The injections are done under local anesthesia. This treatment is not appropriate for extended periods, however. In general, local steroid injections are only used until more definitive treatment options can be used. Corticosteroid injections do not appear to be very effective for slowing disease progression. Surgery Carpal tunnel syndrome operation Release of the transverse carpal ligament is known as \\"carpal tunnel release\\" surgery. It is recommended when there is static (constant, not just intermittent) numbness, muscle weakness, or atrophy, and when night-splinting or other conservative interventions no longer control intermittent symptoms. The surgery may be done with local or regional anesthesia with or without sedation, or under general anesthesia. In general, milder cases can be controlled for months to years, but severe cases are unrelenting symptomatically and are likely to result in surgical treatment. Surgery is more beneficial in the short term to alleviate symptoms (up to six months) than wearing an orthosis for a minimum of 6 weeks. However, surgery and wearing a brace resulted in similar symptom relief in the long term (12‚Äì18 month outcomes).  Physical therapy  An evidence based guideline produced by the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons assigned various grades of recommendation to physical therapy and other nonsurgical treatments. One of the primary issues with physiotherapy is that it attempts to reverse (often) years of pathology inside the carpal tunnel. Practitioners caution that any physiotherapy such as myofascial release may take weeks of persistent application to effectively manage carpal tunnel syndrome. Again, some claim that pro-active ways to reduce stress on the wrists, which alleviates wrist pain and strain, involve adopting a more ergonomic work and life environment. For example, some have claimed that switching from a QWERTY computer keyboard layout to a more optimised ergonomic layout such as Dvorak was commonly cited as beneficial in early CTS studies; however, some meta- analyses of these studies claim that the evidence that they present is limited. Tendon and nerve gliding exercises appear to be useful in carpal tunnel syndrome. Prognosis Scars from carpal tunnel release surgery. Two different techniques were used. The left scar is 6 weeks old, the right scar is 2 weeks old. Also note the muscular atrophy of the thenar eminence in the left hand, a common sign of advanced CTS Most people relieved of their carpal tunnel symptoms with conservative or surgical management find minimal residual or \\"nerve damage\\". Long-term chronic carpal tunnel syndrome (typically seen in the elderly) can result in permanent \\"nerve damage\\", i.e. irreversible numbness, muscle wasting, and weakness. Those that undergo a carpal tunnel release are nearly twice as likely as those not having surgery to develop trigger thumb in the months following the procedure. While outcomes are generally good, certain factors can contribute to poorer results that have little to do with nerves, anatomy, or surgery type. One study showed that mental status parameters or alcohol use yields much poorer overall results of treatment. Recurrence of carpal tunnel syndrome after successful surgery is rare. Epidemiology Rates of carpal tunnel syndrome by ethnicity. CTS is much more common in Caucasians. Carpal tunnel syndrome is estimated to affect one out of ten people during their lifetime and is the most common nerve compression syndrome. It accounts for about 90% of all nerve compression syndromes. In the U.S., 5% of people have the effects of carpal tunnel syndrome. Caucasians have the highest risk of CTS compared with other races such as non-white South Africans. Women suffer more from CTS than men with a ratio of 3:1 between the ages of 45‚Äì60 years. Only 10% of reported cases of CTS are younger than 30 years. Increasing age is a risk factor. CTS is also common in pregnancy. Occupational , 8% of U.S. workers reported ever having carpal tunnel syndrome and 4% reported carpal tunnel syndrome in the past 12 months. Prevalence rates for carpal tunnel syndrome in the past 12 months were higher among females than among males; among workers aged 45‚Äì64 than among those aged 18‚Äì44. Overall, 67% of current carpal tunnel syndrome cases among current/recent workers were reportedly attributed to work by health professionals, indicating that the prevalence rate of work-related carpal tunnel syndrome among workers was 2%, and that there were approximately 3.1 million cases of work-related carpal tunnel syndrome among U.S. workers in 2010. Among current carpal tunnel syndrome cases attributed to specific jobs, 24% were attributed to jobs in the manufacturing industry, a proportion 2.5 times higher than the proportion of current/recent workers employed in the manufacturing industry, suggesting that jobs in this industry are associated with an increased risk of work-related carpal tunnel syndrome. History The condition known as carpal tunnel syndrome had major appearances throughout the years but it was most commonly heard of in the years following World War II. Individuals who had suffered from this condition have been depicted in surgical literature for the mid-19th century. In 1854, Sir James Paget was the first to report median nerve compression at the wrist in two cases.Paget J (1854) Lectures on surgical pathology. Lindsay & Blakinston, Philadelphia The first to notice the association between the carpal ligament pathology and median nerve compression appear to have been Pierre Marie and Charles Foix in 1913. They described the results of a postmortem of an 80-year-old man with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. They suggested that division of the carpal ligament would be curative in such cases. Putman had previously described a series of 37 patients and suggested a vasomotor origin. The association between the thenar muscle atrophy and compression was noted in 1914. The name 'carpal tunnel syndrome' appears to have been coined by Moersch in 1938. In the early 20th century there were various cases of median nerve compression underneath the transverse carpal ligament. Physician Dr. George S. Phalen of the Cleveland Clinic identified the pathology after working with a group of patients in the 1950s and 1960s. ;Treatment Paget described two cases of carpal tunnel syndrome. The first was due to an injury where a cord had been wrapped around a man's wrist. The second was due to a distal radial fracture. For the first case Paget performed an amputation of the hand. For the second case Paget recommended a wrist splint ‚Äì a treatment that is still in use today. Surgery for this condition initially involved the removal of cervical ribs despite Marie and Foix's suggested treatment. In 1933 Sir James Learmonth outlined a method of decompression of the nerve at the wrist. This procedure appears to have been pioneered by the Canadian surgeons Herbert Galloway and Andrew MacKinnon in 1924 in Winnipeg but was not published. Endoscopic release was described in 1988.

The three types are neurofibromatosis type I (NF1), neurofibromatosis type II (NF2), and schwannomatosis. In NF1 symptoms include light brown spots on the skin, freckles in the armpit and groin, small bumps within nerves, and scoliosis. In NF2, there may be hearing loss, cataracts at a young age, balance problems, flesh colored skin flaps, and muscle wasting. In schwannomatosis there may be pain either in one location or in wide areas of the body. The tumors in NF are generally non-cancerous. The cause is a genetic mutation in certain genes. These can be inherited from a person's parents, or in about half of cases spontaneously occur during early development. Different mutations result in the three types of NF. The tumors involve the supporting cells of the nervous system rather than the neurons. In NF1 the tumors are neurofibromas (tumors of the peripheral nerves), while in NF2 and schwannomatosis tumors of Schwann cells are more common. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms, examination, medical imaging, and biopsy. Genetic testing may rarely be done to support the diagnosis. There is no known prevention or cure. Surgery may be done to remove tumors that are causing problems or have become cancerous. Radiation and chemotherapy may also be used if cancer occurs. A cochlear implant or auditory brainstem implant may help some who have hearing loss due to the condition. In the United States, about 1 in 3,500 people have NF1 and 1 in 25,000 have NF2. Males and females are affected equally often. In NF1, symptoms are often present at birth or develop before 10 years of age. While the condition typically worsens with time, most people with NF1 have a normal life expectancy. In NF2, symptoms may not become apparent until early adulthood. NF2 increases the risk of early death. Descriptions of the condition occur as far back as the 1st century. It was formally described by Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen in 1882, after whom it was previously named.  Signs and symptoms  Lisch nodules as seen in NF1 Person with multiple small neurofibromas in the skin and a \\"caf√© au lait spot\\" (bottom of photo, to the right of centre). A biopsy has been taken of one of the lesions. Neurofibromatosis type 1 in early life may cause learning and behavior problems ‚Äì about 60% of children who have NF1 have mild difficulty in school. Signs the individual might have are as follows: * Six or more light brown dermatological spots (\\"caf√© au lait spots\\") * At least two neurofibromas * At least two growths on the eye's iris * Abnormal growth of the spine (scoliosis) People with neurofibromatosis type 2 can exhibit the same type of skin symptoms as type 1, but not necessarily in every case. The symptom most characteristic of NF2 is hearing loss. The hearing loss occurs due to the pressure of tumors on the acoustic nerve. The same pressure can cause headaches, dizziness, and nausea. The main symptom of schwannomatosis is localized pain. This pain is due to tissues and nerves experiencing more pressure because of nearby tumors. Cause Diagram of autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The three types of Neurofibromatosis are caused by different mutations on chromosomes. NF1 is caused by a mutation on the NF1 gene on the arm of chromosome 17. NF2 is caused by a mutation on the NF2 tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 22. Schwannomatosis is caused by various mutations on chromosome 22. Neurofibromatosis is an autosomal dominant disorder, which means only one copy of the affected gene is needed for the disorder to develop. If one parent has neurofibromatosis, his or her children have a 50% chance of developing the condition as well. The severity of the parent's condition does not affect the child; the affected child may have mild NF1 even though it was inherited from a parent with a severe form of the disorder. The types of neurofibromatosis are: * Neurofibromatosis type I, in which the nerve tissue grows tumors (neurofibromas) that may be benign, but may cause serious damage by compressing nerves and other tissues. * Neurofibromatosis type II, in which bilateral acoustic neuromas (tumors of the vestibulocochlear nerve or cranial nerve 8 (CN VIII) also known as schwannoma) develop, often leading to hearing loss. * Schwannomatosis, in which painful schwannomas develop on spinal and peripheral nerves. Pathophysiology Neurofibromatosis type I is caused by a mutation on chromosome 17 encoding a cytoplasmic protein known as neurofibromin. This protein is a tumor suppressor and therefore serves as a signal regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation. A dysfunction or lack of neurofibromin can affect regulation, and cause uncontrolled cell proliferation, leading to the tumors (neurofibromas) that characterize NF1. The neurofibromas caused by NF consist of Schwann cells, fibroblasts, perineuronal cells, mast cells and axons embedded in an extracellular matrix. Another function of neurofibromin is to bind to microtubules that play a role in the release of adenylyl cyclase and its activity. Adenylyl cyclase plays an essential role in cognition. Neurofibromin's role in the activity of adenylyl cyclase explains why patients with NF experience cognitive impairment. Neurofibromatosis type II is caused by a mutation on chromosome 22. The mutation falls on the NF2 tumor suppressor gene. The gene normally encodes a cytoplasmic protein known as merlin. The normal function of merlin is to regulate the activity of multiple growth factors, the mutated copy of the gene leads to merlin's loss of function. The loss of function leads to increased activity of growth factors normally regulated by merlin, leading to the formation of the tumors associated with NF2. Schwannomatosis is caused by a mutation on the SMARCB1 gene. This gene is located near the NF2 tumor suppressor gene leading to the thought that schwannomatosis and NF2 were the same condition. The two conditions show different mutations on two different genes. The normal function of the SMARCB1 gene is to encode a protein called SMARCB1 that is part of a larger protein complex whose function is not completely understood. The complex including SMARCB1 plays a role in tumor suppression. The mutation of the SMARCB1 gene causes a loss of function in the complex leading to the formation of tumors indicative of schwannomatosis. Diagnosis The neurofibromatoses are considered as RASopathies and as members of the neurocutaneous syndromes (phakomatoses). The diagnosis of neurofibromatosis is done via the following means: Differential diagnosis Conditions similar to NF include: Treatment Surgical removal of tumors is an option; however, the risks involved should be assessed first. With regard to OPG (optic pathway gliomas), the preferred treatment is chemotherapy. However, radiotherapy is not recommended in children who present with this disorder. It is recommended that children diagnosed with NF1 at an early age have an examination each year, which allows any potential growths or changes related to the disorder to be monitored. Prognosis In most cases, symptoms of NF1 are mild, and individuals live normal and productive lives. In some cases, however, NF1 can be severely debilitating and may cause cosmetic and psychological issues. The course of NF2 varies greatly among individuals. In some cases of NF2, the damage to nearby vital structures, such as other cranial nerves and the brain stem, can be life-threatening. Most individuals with schwannomatosis have significant pain. In some extreme cases the pain will be severe and disabling. Epidemiology In the United States, about 1 in 3,500 people have NF1, 1 in 25,000 have NF2, and 1 in 40,000 have schwannomatosis. Males and females are affected equally often in all three conditions. In NF1, symptoms are often present at birth or develop before 10 years of age. While the condition typically worsens with time, most people with NF1 have a normal life expectancy. In NF2, symptoms may not become apparent until early adulthood. NF2 increases the risk of early death. Schwannomatosis symptoms develop in early childhood and can worsen with time. Typically life expectancy is unaffected in those with schwannomatosis. History Descriptions of what is believed to be the condition go back as far back as the 1st century. The conditions were formally described by Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen in 1882, after whom it was previously named.

It is caused by mutations in proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1), a major myelin protein. It is characterized by hypomyelination and belongs to a group of genetic diseases referred to as leukodystrophies. Signs and symptoms Hallmark signs and symptoms of Pelizaeus‚ÄìMerzbacher disease include little or no movement in the arms or legs, respiratory difficulties, and characteristic horizontal movements of the eyes left to right. The onset of Pelizaeus‚ÄìMerzbacher disease is usually in early infancy. The most characteristic early signs are nystagmus (rapid, involuntary, rhythmic motion of the eyes) and low muscle tone. Motor abilities are delayed or never acquired, mostly depending upon the severity of the mutation. Most children with Pelizaeus‚ÄìMerzbacher disease learn to understand language, and usually have some speech. Other signs may include tremor, lack of coordination, involuntary movements, weakness, unsteady gait, and over time, spasticity in legs and arms. Muscle contractures often occur over time. Mental functions may deteriorate. Some patients may have convulsions and skeletal deformation, such as scoliosis, resulting from abnormal muscular stress on bones. Cause Pelizaeus‚ÄìMerzbacher disease is caused by X-linked recessive mutations in the major myelin protein proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1). This causes hypomyelination in the central nervous system and severe neurological disease.The majority of mutations result in duplications of the entire PLP1 gene. Deletions of PLP1 locus (which are rare) cause a milder form of Pelizaeus‚ÄìMerzbacher disease than is observed with the typical duplication mutations, which demonstrates the critical importance of gene dosage at this locus for normal CNS function. Diagnosis The diagnosis of Pelizaeus‚ÄìMerzbacher disease is often first suggested after identification by magnetic resonance imaging of abnormal white matter (high T2 signal intensity, i.e. T2 lengthening) throughout the brain, which is typically evident by about 1 year of age, but more subtle abnormalities should be evident during infancy. Unless a family history consistent with sex-linked inheritance exists, the condition is often misdiagnosed as cerebral palsy. Once a PLP1 mutation is identified, prenatal diagnosis or preimplantation genetic diagnostic testing is possible. Classification The disease is one in a group of genetic disorders collectively known as leukodystrophies that affect growth of the myelin sheath, the fatty covering‚Äîwhich acts as an insulator‚Äîon nerve fibers in the central nervous system. The several forms of Pelizaeus‚ÄìMerzbacher disease include classic, connatal, transitional, and adult variants. Milder mutations of the PLP1 gene that mainly cause leg weakness and spasticity, with little or no cerebral involvement, are classified as spastic paraplegia 2 (SPG2). Treatment No cure or standard treatment for Pelizaeus‚ÄìMerzbacher disease has been developed. Outcomes are variable: people with the most severe form of the disease do not usually survive to adolescence, although with milder forms, survival into adulthood is possible. Research In December 2008, StemCells, Inc received clearance in the United States to conduct a phase I clinical trials of human neural stem cell transplantation. The trial did not show meaningful efficacy and the company has since gone bankrupt. In 2019 Paul Tesar used CRISPR and antisense therapy in a mouse model of Pelizaeus‚ÄìMerzbacher with success. Iron chelation as a potential treatment is also being studied. See also * The Myelin Project * The Stennis Foundation References Further reading *  External links  * Pelizaeus- Merzbacher Disease.

The youngest son of Francis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, Leopold took a commission in the Imperial Russian Army and fought against Napoleon after French troops overran Saxe-Coburg during the Napoleonic Wars. After Napoleon's defeat, Leopold moved to the United Kingdom where he married Princess Charlotte of Wales, who was second in line to the British throne and the only legitimate child of the Prince Regent (the future King George IV). Charlotte died after only a year of marriage, but Leopold continued to enjoy considerable status in Britain. After the Greek War of Independence (1821‚Äì32), Leopold was offered the crown of Greece but turned it down, believing it to be too precarious. Instead, he accepted the kingship of Belgium in 1831 following the country's independence in 1830. The Belgian government offered the position to Leopold because of his diplomatic connections with royal houses across Europe, and because as the British-backed candidate, he was not affiliated with other powers, such as France, which were believed to have territorial ambitions in Belgium which might threaten the European balance of power created by the 1815 Congress of Vienna. Leopold took his oath as King of the Belgians on 21 July 1831, an event commemorated annually as Belgian National Day. His reign was marked by attempts by the Dutch to recapture Belgium and, later, by internal political division between liberals and Catholics. As a Protestant, Leopold was considered liberal and encouraged economic modernisation, playing an important role in encouraging the creation of Belgium's first railway in 1835 and subsequent industrialisation. As a result of the ambiguities in the Belgian Constitution, Leopold was able to slightly expand the monarch's powers during his reign. He also played an important role in stopping the spread of the Revolutions of 1848 into Belgium. He died in 1865 and was succeeded by his son, Leopold II. Early life Ehrenburg Palace in Coburg, where Leopold was born in 1790, pictured Leopold was born in Coburg in the tiny German duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld in modern- day Bavaria on 16 December 1790. He was the youngest son of Francis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and Countess Augusta Reuss-Ebersdorf. In 1826, Saxe- Coburg acquired the city of Gotha from the neighboring Duchy of Saxe-Gotha- Altenburg and gave up Saalfeld to Saxe-Meiningen, becoming Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Military career In 1797, at just six years old, Leopold was given an honorary commission of the rank of colonel in the Izmaylovsky Regiment, part of the Imperial Guard, in the Imperial Russian Army. Six years later, he received a promotion to the rank of Major General. When French troops occupied the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars, Leopold went to Paris where he became part of the Imperial Court of Napoleon. Napoleon offered him the position of adjutant, but Leopold refused. Instead, he went to Russia to take up a military career in the Imperial Russian cavalry, which was at war with France at the time. He campaigned against Napoleon and distinguished himself at the Battle of Kulm at the head of his cuirassier division. By 1815, the time of the final defeat of Napoleon, he had reached the rank of lieutenant general at only 25 years of age. Marriage to Charlotte Engraving of the wedding of Charlotte and Leopold in 1816 Leopold received British citizenship in 1815. On 2 May 1816, Leopold married Princess Charlotte of Wales at Carlton House in London. Charlotte was the only legitimate child of the Prince Regent George (later King George IV) and therefore second in line to the British throne. Charlotte had been engaged to the Prince of Orange, but finding him distasteful, broke it off in favour of Leopold. The Prince Regent was displeased, but found Leopold to be charming and possessing every quality to make his daughter happy, thus approving of their marriage. The same year he received an honorary commission to the rank of Field Marshal and Knight of the Order of the Garter. The couple lived initially at Camelford House on Park Lane, and then at Marlborough House on Pall Mall. On 5 November 1817, after having suffered a miscarriage, Princess Charlotte gave birth to a stillborn son. She herself died the next day following complications. Leopold was said to have been heartbroken by her death. Had Charlotte survived, she would have become queen of the United Kingdom on the death of her father and Leopold presumably would have assumed the role of prince consort, later taken by his nephew Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Despite Charlotte's death, the Prince Regent granted Prince Leopold the British style of Royal Highness by Order in Council on 6 April 1818. From 1828 to 1829, Leopold had an affair with the actress Caroline Bauer, who bore a striking resemblance to Charlotte. Caroline was a cousin of his advisor Baron Christian Friedrich von Stockmar. She came to England with her mother and took up residence at Longwood House, a few miles from Claremont House. But, by mid-1829, the liaison was over, and the actress and her mother returned to Berlin. Many years later, in memoirs published after her death, she declared that she and Leopold had engaged in a morganatic marriage and that he had bestowed upon her the title of Countess Montgomery. He would have broken this marriage when the possibility arose that he could become King of Greece.K. BAUER, Aus meinem B√ºhnenleben. Erinnerungen von Karoline Bauer, Berlin, 1876‚Äì1877. The son of Baron Stockmar denied that these events ever happened, and indeed no records have been found of a civil or religious marriage with the actress.E. VON STOCKMAR, Denkw√ºrdigkeiten aus den Papiere des Freihernn Christian Friedrich von Stockmar, Brunswick, 1873 ; R. VON WANGENHEIM, Baron Stockmar. Eine coburgisch-englische Geschichte, Coburg, 1996. Refusal of the Greek throne Following a Greek rebellion against the Ottoman Empire, Leopold was offered the throne of an independent Greece as part of the London Protocol of February 1830. Though initially showing interest in the position, Leopold eventually turned down the offer on 17 May 1830. The role would subsequently be accepted by Otto of Wittelsbach in May 1832 who ruled until he was finally deposed in October 1862. Acceptance of the Belgian throne Leopold taking the constitutional oath during his enthronement. By the artist Gustaf Wappers At the end of August 1830, rebels in the Southern provinces (modern-day Belgium) of the United Netherlands rose up against Dutch rule. The rising, which began in Brussels, pushed the Dutch army back, and the rebels defended themselves against a Dutch attack. International powers meeting in London agreed to support the independence of Belgium, even though the Dutch refused to recognize the new state. In November 1830, a National Congress was established in Belgium to create a constitution for the new state. Fears of \\"mob rule\\" associated with republicanism after the French Revolution of 1789, as well as the example of the recent, liberal July Revolution in France, led the Congress to decide that Belgium would be a popular, constitutional monarchy. Search for a monarch The choice of candidates for the position was one of the most controversial issues faced by the revolutionaries. The Congress refused to consider any candidate from the Dutch ruling house of Orange-Nassau. Some Orangists had hoped to offer the position to King William I or his son, William, Prince of Orange, which would bring Belgium into personal union with the Netherlands like Luxembourg. The Great Powers also worried that a candidate from another state could risk destabilizing the international balance of power and lobbied for a neutral candidate. Eventually the Congress was able to draw up a shortlist. The three viable possibilities were felt to be Eug√®ne de Beauharnais, a French nobleman and stepson of Napoleon; Auguste of Leuchtenberg, son of Eugene; and Louis, Duke of Nemours who was the son of the French King Louis-Philippe. All the candidates were French and the choice between them was principally between choosing the Bonapartism of Beauharnais or Leuchtenberg and supporting the July Monarchy of Louis-Philippe. Louis-Philippe realized that the choice of either of the Bonapartists could be first stage of a coup against him, but that his son would also be unacceptable to other European powers suspicious of French intentions. Nemours refused the offer. With no definitive choice in sight, Catholics and Liberals united to elect Erasme Louis Surlet de Chokier, a minor Belgian nobleman, as regent to buy more time for a definitive decision in February 1831. Leopold of Saxe-Coburg had been proposed at an early stage, but had been dropped because of French opposition. The problems caused by the French candidates and the increased international pressure for a solution led to his reconsideration. On 22 April, he was finally approached by a Belgian delegation at Marlborough House to officially offer him the throne. Leopold, however, was reluctant to accept. Accession On 17 July 1831, Leopold travelled from Calais to Belgium, entering the country at De Panne. Travelling to Brussels, he was greeted with patriotic enthusiasm along his route. The accession ceremony took place on 21 July on the Place Royale in Brussels. A stand had been erected on the steps of the church of Saint Jacques-sur- Coudenberg, surrounded by the names of revolutionaries fallen during the fighting in 1830. After a ceremony of resignation by the regent, Leopold, dressed in the uniform of a Belgian lieutenant-general, swore loyalty to the constitution and became king. The enthronement is generally used to mark the end of the revolution and the start of the Kingdom of Belgium and is celebrated each year as the Belgian national holiday. Reign personal monogram Consolidation of independence Less than two weeks after Leopold's accession, on 2 August, the Netherlands invaded Belgium, starting the Ten Days' Campaign. The small Belgian army was overwhelmed by the Dutch assault and was pushed back. Faced with a military crisis, Leopold appealed to the French for support. The French promised support, and the arrival of their ' in Belgium forced the Dutch to accept a diplomatic mediation and retreat back to the pre-war border. Skirmishes continued for eight years, but in 1839, the two countries signed the Treaty of London, whereby the Dutch recognised Belgium's independence. Leopold was generally unsatisfied with the amount of power allocated to the monarch in the Constitution, and sought to extend it wherever the Constitution was ambiguous or unclear while generally avoiding involvement in routine politics. Subsequent reign first Belgian postage stamp, issued in 1849 Leopold I's reign was also marked by an economic crisis which lasted until the late 1850s. In the aftermath of the revolution, the Dutch had closed the Scheldt to Belgian shipping, meaning that the port of Antwerp was effectively useless. The Netherlands and the Dutch colonies in particular, which had been profitable markets for Belgian manufacturers before 1830, were totally closed to Belgian goods. The period between 1845 and 1849 was particularly hard in Flanders, where harvests failed and a third of the population became dependent on poor relief, and have been described as the \\"worst years of Flemish history\\". The economic situation in Flanders also increased the internal migration to Brussels and the industrial areas of Wallonia, which continued throughout the period. Politics in Belgium under Leopold I were polarized between liberal and Catholic political factions, though before 1847 they collaborated in \\"Unionist\\" governments. The liberals were opposed to the Church's influence in politics and society, while supporting free trade, personal liberties and secularization. The Catholics wanted religious teachings to be a fundamental basis for the state and society and opposed all attempts by the liberals to attack the Church's official privileges. Initially, these factions existed only as informal groups with which prominent politicians were generally identified. The liberals held power through much of Leopold I's reign. An official Liberal Party was formed in 1846, although a formal Catholic Party was only established in 1869. Leopold, who was himself a Protestant, tended to favor liberals and shared their desire for reform, even though he was not partisan. On his own initiative, in 1842, Leopold proposed a law which would have stopped women and children from working in some industries, but the bill was defeated. Leopold was an early supporter of railways, and Belgium's first stretch of this railway, between northern Brussels and Mechelen, was completed in 1835. When completed, it was one of the first passenger railways in continental Europe. Revolution of 1848 Engraving of Leopold's theatrical offer in 1848 to abdicate if it was the will of the Belgian people The success of economic reforms partially mitigated the effects of the economic downturn and meant that Belgium was not as badly affected as its neighbors by the Revolutions of 1848. Nevertheless, in early 1848, a large number of radical publications appeared. The most serious threat of the 1848 revolutions in Belgium was posed by Belgian √©migr√© groups. Shortly after the revolution in France, Belgian migrant workers living in Paris were encouraged to return to Belgium to overthrow the monarchy and establish a republic. Around 6,000 armed √©migr√©s of the \\"Belgian Legion\\" attempted to cross the Belgian frontier. The first group, travelling by train, was stopped and quickly disarmed at Qui√©vrain on 26 March 1848. The second group crossed the border on 29 March and headed for Brussels. They were confronted by Belgian troops at the hamlet of Risquons-Tout and, during fighting, seven √©migr√©s were killed and most of the rest were captured. To defuse tension, Leopold theatrically offered his abdication, if this was the wish of the majority of his people. The defeat at Risquons-Tout effectively ended the revolutionary threat to Belgium, as the situation in Belgium began to recover that summer after a good harvest, and fresh elections returned a strong Liberal majority. Role in international relations Leopold (right), with Queen Victoria and family in an early photograph of 1859 Because of his family connections and position at the head of a neutral and unthreatening power, Leopold was able to act as an important intermediary in European politics during his reign. As a result of this, he earned the nickname the \\"Nestor of Europe\\", after the wise mediator in Homer's Iliad. Leopold played a particularly important role in moderating relations between the hostile Great Powers. In the later part of his reign, his role in managing relations between Great Britain and the French Empire of Napoleon III was particularly important. Leopold was particularly known as a political marriage broker.B√©eche. Arturo E. The Coburgs of Europe. Eurohistory. 2013. pp. ii, 4, 46, 354‚Äì355. He promoted the marriage of his niece, Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, to his nephew, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Even before she succeeded to the throne, Leopold had been advising Victoria by letter, and continued to influence her after her accession. In foreign policy, Leopold's principal object was the maintenance of Belgian neutrality. Despite pressure from the Great Powers, especially over the Crimean War (1853‚Äì56), Belgium remained neutral throughout the reigns of Leopold I and II. Second marriage and family Leopold's funeral cortege in Brussels on 16 December 1865 Leopold married Louise-Marie of Orl√©ans (daughter of Louis Philippe I) on 9 August 1832. They had four children: * Louis Philippe, Crown Prince of Belgium (24 July 1833 ‚Äì 16 May 1834) who died in infancy. * Leopold, Duke of Brabant (9 April 1835 ‚Äì 17 December 1909), the future King Leopold II, who married Archduchess Marie-Henriette of Austria on 22 August 1853. They had four children. He religiously but not civilly remarried Caroline Lacroix, which made the marriage unrecognized by law, on 12 December 1909 on his deathbed. They had two illegitimate sons. * Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders (24 March 1837 ‚Äì 17 November 1905) who married Princess Marie of Hohenzollern on 25 April 1867. They had five children. * Princess Charlotte of Belgium (7 June 1840 ‚Äì 19 January 1927), the future Empress of Mexico, who married Maximilian I of Mexico on 27 July 1857 and had no issue. She adopted two sons. Queen Louise-Marie died of tuberculosis on 11 October 1850, aged 38. Leopold also had two sons, George and Arthur, by his mistress Arcadie Meyer (). George von Eppinghoven was born in 1849, and Arthur von Eppinghoven in 1852. At Leopold's request, in 1862 his two sons were created Freiherr von Eppinghoven by his nephew, Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha; in 1863 Arcadie was also created as Baronin von Eppinghoven. Death Leopold died in Laeken near Brussels on 10 December 1865, aged 74. His funeral was held on 16 December. He is interred in the Royal Crypt at the Church of Notre-Dame de Laeken, next to Louise-Marie. Succession Leopold was succeeded by his son, Leopold II, aged 30, who would rule until 1909. Commemoration Belgian naval vessels named in his honour include the Leopold I, a frigate acquired by Belgium in 2007. His monogram features on the flag of the Flemish town of Leopoldsburg.

Netanyahu is also the Chairman of the Likud ‚Äì National Liberal Movement. He is the longest-serving Prime Minister in Israeli history and the first to be born in Israel after the establishment of the state. Born in Tel Aviv to secular Jewish parents, Netanyahu was raised in both Jerusalem and the Philadelphia area of the United States. He returned to Israel immediately upon graduating high school in 1967 to join the Israel Defense Forces shortly after the Six- Day War. Netanyahu became a team leader in the Sayeret Matkal special forces unit and took part in many missions, including Operation Gift (1968) and Operation Isotope (1972), during which he was shot in the shoulder. Netanyahu fought on the front lines in the War of Attrition and the Yom Kippur War in 1973, taking part in special forces raids along the Suez Canal and then leading a commando assault deep into Syrian territory. Netanyahu achieved the rank of captain before being discharged. After graduating from MIT with a Bachelor of Science (SB) and a Master of Science (SM), Netanyahu became an economic consultant for the Boston Consulting Group. He moved back to Israel in 1978 to found the Yonatan Netanyahu Anti-Terror Institute, named after his brother Yonatan Netanyahu, who died leading Operation Entebbe. In 1984, Netanyahu was appointed the Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, a role he held until 1988. He was subsequently elected to the Knesset before becoming the leader of Likud in 1993; he then led the party to victory at the 1996 election, becoming Israel's youngest-ever prime minister. After being defeated in the 1999 election, Netanyahu left politics, returning to the private sector. He later served as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Finance in the government of Ariel Sharon, but eventually resigned over disagreements regarding the Gaza disengagement plan. As Finance Minister, Netanyahu initiated major reforms of the Israeli economy that were credited by commentators as having significantly improved Israel's subsequent economic performance. Netanyahu returned to the leadership of Likud in December 2005 after Sharon stepped down to form a new party, Kadima. Although Likud finished second in the 2009 election to Kadima, Netanyahu was able to form a coalition government with other right-wing parties and was sworn in as Prime Minister for a second time. He went on to lead Likud to victory in the 2013 and 2015 elections. After the April 2019 election resulted in no party being able to form a government, a second election in 2019 took place. In the September 2019 election, the centrist Blue and White party, led by Benny Gantz, emerged slightly ahead of Netanyahu's Likud; however, neither Netanyahu nor Gantz was able to form a government. After continued political deadlock, this was resolved when Likud and Blue and White reached a coalition agreement following the 2020 Israeli legislative election. Under the terms of the agreement, the premiership would rotate between Netanyahu and Benny Gantz, with Gantz scheduled to succeed Netanyahu in November 2021. Since December 2016, Netanyahu has been under investigation for corruption by Israeli police and prosecutors. On 21 November 2019, he was indicted on charges of breach of trust, bribery and fraud. Due to the indictment, Netanyahu is legally required to relinquish all of his ministry posts other than the prime minister position.  Early life and military career  Netanyahu was born in 1949 in Tel Aviv, Israel, to a predominantly Ashkenazi Jewish family with some Sephardic ancestry, who claim descent from the Vilna Goan.Itamar Eichner (25 May 2016) \\"Netanyahu: I have Sephardic roots as well\\", Ynetnews His mother, Tzila Segal (1912‚Äì2000) was born in Petah Tikva in the Ottoman Empire's Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem, and his father, Warsaw- born, Prof. Benzion Netanyahu (nee Mileikowsky) (1910‚Äì2012) was an accomplished historian specializing in the Jewish Golden age of Spain. Netanyahu's paternal grandfather, Nathan Mileikowsky was a notable rabbi and zionist writer. When Netanyahu's father emigrated to Israel he hebraized his surname from \\"Mileikowsky\\" to \\"Netanyahu\\" meaning \\"God has given\\". Netanyahu was the second of three children. He was initially raised and educated in Jerusalem, where he attended Henrietta Szold Elementary School. A copy of his evaluation from his 6th grade teacher Ruth Rubenstein indicated that Netanyahu was courteous, polite, and helpful; that his work was \\"responsible and punctual\\"; and that he was friendly, disciplined, cheerful, brave, active, and obedient. Between 1956 and 1958, and again from 1963 to 1967, his family lived in the United States in Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia, while father Benzion Netanyahu taught at Dropsie College. Benjamin attended and graduated from Cheltenham High School and was active in the debate club, chess club, and soccer. He and his brother Yonatan grew dissatisfied with a perceived superficial way of life they encountered in the area, including the prevalent youth counterculture movement, literary interpretation focused on individualized feelings, and the liberal sensibilities of the Reform synagogue, Temple Judea of Philadelphia, that the family attended. To this day, he speaks fluent English, with a noticeable Philadelphia accent. After graduating from high school in 1967, Netanyahu returned to Israel to enlist in the Israel Defense Forces. He trained as a combat soldier and served for five years in an elite special forces unit of the IDF, Sayeret Matkal. He took part in numerous cross-border assault raids during the 1967‚Äì70 War of Attrition, rising to become a team-leader in the unit. He was wounded in combat on multiple occasions. He was involved in many other missions, including the 1968 Israeli raid on Lebanon and the rescue of the hijacked Sabena Flight 571 in May 1972, in which he was shot in the shoulder. He was discharged from active service in 1972 but remained in the Sayeret Matkal reserves. Following his discharge, he left to study in the United States but returned in October 1973 to serve in the Yom Kippur War. He took part in special forces raids along the Suez Canal against Egyptian forces before leading a commando attack deep inside Syrian territory, the details of which remain classified today. Education SB and SM degrees. Netanyahu returned to the United States in late 1972 to study architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). After briefly returning to Israel to fight in the Yom Kippur War, he returned to the United States and under the name Ben Nitay, completed a bachelor's degree in architecture in February 1975 and earned a master's degree from the MIT Sloan School of Management in June 1976. Concurrently, he was studying towards a doctorate in political science,Cathy Hartley, David Lea, Paul Cossali, Annamarie Rowe, Survey of Arab-Israeli Relations (Taylor & Francis, 2004), p. 522 until his studies were broken off by the death of his brother in Operation Entebbe. At MIT, Netanyahu studied a double-load, completing a master's degree (that would normally take four years) in only two and a half years, despite taking a break to fight in the Yom Kippur War, and while simultaneously completing a thesis in a graduate course at Harvard. Professor Groisser at MIT recalled: \\"He did superbly. He was very bright. Organized. Strong. Powerful. He knew what he wanted to do and how to get it done.\\" At that time he changed his name to Benjamin Ben Nitai (Nitai, a reference to both Mount Nitai and to the eponymous Jewish sage Nittai of Arbela, was a pen name often used by his father for articles). Years later, in an interview with the media, Netanyahu clarified that he decided to do so to make it easier for Americans to pronounce his name. This fact has been used by his political rivals to accuse him indirectly of a lack of Israeli national identity and loyalty. In 1976, Netanyahu's older brother Yonatan Netanyahu was killed. Yonatan was serving as the commander of Benjamin's former unit, the Sayeret Matkal, and died during the counter- terrorism hostage-rescue mission Operation Entebbe in which his unit rescued more than 100 mostly Israeli hostages hijacked by terrorists and flown to the Entebbe Airport in Uganda. In 1976, Netanyahu graduated near the top of his class at the MIT Sloan School of Management, and was headhunted to be an economic consultantMazal Mualem (30 September 2014), \\"Netanyahu's rhetoric brings same old message\\" , Al-Monitor's Israel Pulse for the Boston Consulting Group in Boston, Massachusetts, working at the company between 1976 and 1978. At the Boston Consulting Group, he was a colleague of Mitt Romney, with whom he formed a lasting friendship. Romney remembers that Netanyahu at the time was: \\"[A] strong personality with a distinct point of view\\", and says \\"[w]e can almost speak in shorthand... [w]e share common experiences and have a perspective and underpinning which is similar.\\" Netanyahu said that their \\"easy communication\\" was a result of \\"B.C.G.'s intellectually rigorous boot camp\\". In 1978, Netanyahu appeared on Boston local television, under the name of \\"Ben Nitai\\", where he argued: \\"The real core of the conflict is the unfortunate Arab refusal to accept the State of Israel ... For 20 years the Arabs had both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and if self-determination, as they now say, is the core of the conflict, they could have easily established a Palestinian state.\\"(English);Who is Ben Nitay, and why does he look so much like Binyamin Netanyahu? Jerusalem Post Netanyahu (right) with Sorin Hershko, a soldier wounded and permanently paralyzed in Operation Entebbe, 2 July 1986 In 1978, Netanyahu returned to Israel. Between 1978 and 1980, he ran the Jonathan Netanyahu Anti-Terror Institute, a non-governmental organization devoted to the study of terrorism; the Institute held a number of international conferences focused on the discussion of international terrorism. From 1980 to 1982, he was director of marketing for Rim Industries in Jerusalem.Shirley Anne Warshaw, The Clinton Years, (Infobase Publishing, 2009), p. 240 During this period Netanyahu made his first connections with several Israeli politicians, including Minister Moshe Arens, who appointed him as his Deputy Chief of Mission at the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C. while Arens was ambassador to the United States, a position he held from 1982 until 1984. During the 1982 Lebanon War, he was called up for reserve duty in Sayeret Matkal and requested to be released from service, preferring to remain in the US and serve as a spokesperson for Israel in the wake of harsh international criticism of the war. He presented Israel's case to the media during the war and established a highly efficient public relations system in the Israeli embassy. Between 1984 and 1988, Netanyahu served as the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations. Netanyahu was influenced by Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, with whom he formed a relationship during the 1980s. He referred to Schneerson as \\"the most influential man of our time\\".David Singer, American Jewish Yearbook. AJC, 1998. pp. 133‚Äì34 It was while living in New York during the 1980s that Netanyahu became friends with Fred Trump, the father of Donald Trump.Gabriel Sherman (1 June 2016), \\"Trump Is Considering a Pre-Convention Visit to Israel\\" New York  Chairman of Likud  Prior to the 1988 Israeli legislative election, Netanyahu returned to Israel and joined the Likud party. In the Likud's internal elections, Netanyahu was placed fifth on the party list. Later on he was elected as a Knesset member of the 12th Knesset, and was appointed as a deputy of the foreign minister Moshe Arens, and later on David Levy. Netanyahu and Levy did not cooperate and the rivalry between the two only intensified afterwards. During the Gulf War in early 1991, the English-fluent Netanyahu emerged as the principal spokesman for Israel in media interviews on CNN and other news outlets. During the Madrid Conference of 1991 Netanyahu was a member of the Israeli delegation headed by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. After the Madrid Conference Netanyahu was appointed as Deputy Minister in the Israeli Prime Minister's Office. Following the defeat of the Likud party in the 1992 Israeli legislative elections the Likud party held a primary election in 1993 to select its leader, and Netanyahu was victorious, defeating Benny Begin, son of the late Prime Minister Menachem Begin, and veteran politician David Levy (Sharon initially sought Likud party leadership as well, but quickly withdrew when it was evident that he was attracting minimal support). Shamir retired from politics shortly after the Likud's defeat in the 1992 elections. Following the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, his temporary successor Shimon Peres decided to call early elections in order to give the government a mandate to advance the peace process. Netanyahu was the Likud's candidate for Prime Minister in the 1996 Israeli legislative election which took place on 26 May 1996 and were the first Israeli elections in which Israelis elected their Prime Minister directly. Netanyahu hired American Republican political operative Arthur Finkelstein to run his campaign, and although the American style of sound bites and sharp attacks elicited harsh criticism, it proved effective. When Netanyahu won the 1996 election, he became the youngest person in the history of the position and the first Israeli Prime Minister to be born in the State of Israel (Yitzhak Rabin was born in Jerusalem, under the British Mandate of Palestine, prior to the 1948 founding of the Israeli state). Netanyahu's victory over the pre-election favorite Shimon Peres surprised many. The main catalyst in the downfall of the latter was a wave of suicide bombings shortly before the elections; on 3 and 4 March 1996, Palestinians carried out two suicide bombings, killing 32 Israelis, with Peres seemingly unable to stop the attacks. During the campaign, Netanyahu stressed that progress in the peace process would be based on the Palestinian National Authority fulfilling its obligations‚Äìmainly fighting terrorism‚Äîand the Likud campaign slogan was, \\"Netanyahu ‚Äì making a safe peace\\". However, although Netanyahu won the election for Prime Minister, Peres's Israeli Labor Party received more seats in the Knesset elections. Netanyahu had to rely on a coalition with the ultra- Orthodox parties, Shas and UTJ in order to form a government.  First term as Prime Minister  Netanyahu's first meeting with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat at the Erez crossing, 4 September 1996 A spate of suicide bombings reinforced the Likud position for security. Hamas claimed responsibility for most of the bombings. As Prime Minister, Netanyahu raised many questions about many central premises of the Oslo Accords. One of his main points was disagreement with the Oslo premise that the negotiations should proceed in stages, meaning that concessions should be made to Palestinians before any resolution was reached on major issues, such as the status of Jerusalem, and the amending of the Palestinian National Charter. Oslo supporters had claimed that the multi-stage approach would build goodwill among Palestinians and would propel them to seek reconciliation when these major issues were raised in later stages. Netanyahu said that these concessions only gave encouragement to extremist elements, without receiving any tangible gestures in return. He called for tangible gestures of Palestinian goodwill in return for Israeli concessions. Despite his stated differences with the Oslo Accords, Prime Minister Netanyahu continued their implementation, but his Premiership saw a marked slow-down in the peace process. In 1996, Netanyahu and Jerusalem's mayor Ehud Olmert decided to open an exit in the Arab Quarter for the Western Wall Tunnel, which prior Prime Minister Shimon Peres had instructed to be put on hold for the sake of peace. This sparked three days of rioting by Palestinians, resulting in dozens of both Israelis and Palestinians being killed. Netanyahu first met Palestinian President Arafat on 4 September 1996. Prior to the meeting, the two leaders spoke by telephone.Arafat, Netanyahu shake hands, begin talks 4 September 1996, CNN The meetings would continue through Autumn 1996. On their first meeting, Netanyahu said: \\"I would like to emphasize that we have to take into account the needs and the requirements of both sides on the basis of reciprocity and the assurance of the security and well-being of both Israelis and Palestinian alike.\\" Arafat said: \\"We are determined to work with Mr. Netanyahu and with his government.\\"Joint press conference with Prime Minister Netanyahu and PA Chairman Arafat, 4 September 1996 Vol. 16: 1996‚Äì1997, Ministry of Foreign Affairs The talks culminated on 14 January 1997, in the signing of the Hebron Protocol.Netanyahu, Arafat shake hands on Hebron accord 14 January 1997, CNN The signing of the Hebron Protocol with the Palestinian Authority resulted in the redeployment of Israeli forces in Hebron and the turnover of civilian authority in much of the area to the control of the Palestinian Authority. Netanyahu sitting with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat at the Wye River Memorandum, 1998 Eventually, the lack of progress of the peace process led to new negotiations which produced the Wye River Memorandum in 1998 which detailed the steps to be taken by the Israeli government and Palestinian Authority to implement the earlier Interim Agreement of 1995. It was signed by Netanyahu and PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, and on 17 November 1998, Israel's 120 member parliament, the Knesset, approved the Wye River Memorandum by a vote of 75‚Äì19. In a nod to the 1967 Khartoum conference, Prime Minister Netanyahu emphasized a policy of \\"three no(s)\\": no withdrawal from the Golan Heights, no discussion of the case of Jerusalem, no negotiations under any preconditions.Hawas, Akram T. The new alliance: Turkey and Israel . The fourth Nordic conference on Middle Eastern Studies: The Middle East in globalizing world. Oslo, 13‚Äì16 August 1998. In 1997, Netanyahu authorized a Mossad operation to assassinate Hamas leader Khaled Mashal in Jordan, just 3 years after the two countries had signed a peace treaty. The Mossad team, covering as five Canadian tourists, entered Jordan on 27 September 1997 and injected poison into Mashal's ears in a street in Amman. The plot was exposed and two agents were arrested by the Jordanian police while three others hid in the Israeli embassy which was then surrounded by troops. An angry King Hussein demanded Israel to give out the antidote and threatened to annul the peace treaty. Netanyahu relented to the demands after pressure by US President Bill Clinton and ordered the release of 61 Jordanian and Palestinian prisoners including Sheikh Ahmad Yassin. The incident sent the nascent Israeli-Jordanian relations plummeting. During his term, Netanyahu also began a process of economic liberalization, taking steps towards a free-market economy. Under his watch, the government began selling its shares in banks and major state-run companies. Netanyahu also greatly eased Israel's strict foreign exchange controls, enabling Israelis to take an unrestricted amount of money out of the country, open foreign bank accounts, hold foreign currency, and invest freely in other countries. Prime Minister Netanyahu, with his son, at the Western Wall in 1998. Throughout his term, Netanyahu was opposed by the political left wing in Israel and lost support from the right because of his concessions to the Palestinians in Hebron and elsewhere, and due to his negotiations with Arafat generally. Netanyahu lost favor with the Israeli public after a long chain of scandals involving his marriage and corruption charges. In 1997, police recommended that Netanyahu be indicted on corruption charges for influence-peddling. He was accused of appointing an attorney general who would reduce the charges but prosecutors ruled that there was insufficient evidence to go to trial. In 1999, Netanyahu faced another scandal when the Israel Police recommended that he be tried for corruption for $100,000 in free services from a government contractor; Israel's attorney general did not prosecute, citing difficulties with evidence. Election defeat After being defeated by Ehud Barak in the 1999 election for Prime Minister, Netanyahu temporarily retired from politics. He subsequently served as a senior consultant with Israeli communications equipment manufacturer BATM Advanced Communications for two years. With the fall of the Barak government in late 2000, Netanyahu expressed his desire to return to politics. By law, Barak's resignation was supposed to lead to elections for the prime minister position only. Netanyahu insisted that general elections should be held, claiming that otherwise it would be impossible to have a stable government. Netanyahu decided eventually not to run for the prime minister position, a move which facilitated the surprising rise to power of Ariel Sharon, who at the time was considered less popular than Netanyahu. In 2002, after the Israeli Labor Party left the coalition and vacated the position of foreign minister, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon appointed Netanyahu as Foreign Minister. Netanyahu challenged Sharon for the leadership of the Likud party, but failed to oust Sharon. On 9 September 2002, a scheduled speech by Netanyahu at Concordia University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada was canceled after hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters overwhelmed security and smashed through a glass window. Netanyahu was not present at the protest, having remained at Montreal's Ritz-Carlton Hotel throughout the duration. He later accused the activists of supporting terrorism and \\"mad zealotry\\". Weeks later on 1 October 2002 around 200 protesters met Netanyahu outside his Heinz Hall appearance in Pittsburgh although Pittsburgh Police, Israeli security and a Pittsburgh SWAT unit allowed his speeches to continue downtown at the hall and the Duquesne Club as well as suburban Robert Morris University. On 12 September 2002, Netanyahu testified (under oath as a private citizen) before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform regarding the nuclear threat posed by the Iraqi r√©gime: \\"There is no question whatsoever that Saddam is seeking and is working and is advancing towards the development of nuclear weapons ‚Äì no question whatsoever,\\" he said. \\"And there is no question that once he acquires it, history shifts immediately.\\" In his testimony, Netanyahu also said, \\"If you take out Saddam, Saddam‚Äôs regime, I guarantee you that it will have enormous positive reverberations on the region.\\"  Minister of Finance  After the 2003 Israeli legislative election, in what many observers regarded as a surprise move, Sharon offered the Foreign Ministry to Silvan Shalom and offered Netanyahu the Finance Ministry. Some pundits speculated that Sharon made the move because he deemed Netanyahu a political threat given his demonstrated effectiveness as Foreign Minister, and that by placing him in the Finance Ministry during a time of economic uncertainty, he could diminish Netanyahu's popularity. Netanyahu accepted the new appointment. Sharon and Netanyahu came to an agreement that Netanyahu would have complete freedom as Finance Minister and have Sharon back all of his reforms, in exchange for Netanyahu's silence over Sharon's management of Israel's military and foreign affairs. As Finance Minister, Netanyahu undertook an economic plan in order to restore Israel's economy from its low point during the Second Intifada. Netanyahu claimed that a bloated public sector and excessive regulations were largely responsible for stifling economic growth. His plan involved a move toward more liberalized markets, although it was not without its critics. He instituted a program to end welfare dependency by requiring people to apply for jobs or training, reduced the size of the public sector, froze government spending for three years, and capped the budget deficit at 1%. The taxation system was streamlined and taxes were cut, with the top individual tax rate reduced from 64% to 44% and the corporate tax rate from 36% to 18%. A host of state assets worth billions of dollars were privatized, including banks, oil refineries, the El Al national airline, and Zim Integrated Shipping Services. The retirement ages for both men and women were raised, and currency exchange laws were further liberalized. Commercial banks were forced to spin off their long-term savings. In addition, Netanyahu attacked monopolies and cartels to increase competition. As the Israeli economy started booming and unemployment fell significantly, Netanyahu was widely credited by commentators as having performed an 'economic miracle' by the end of his tenure.Likud Leaders, Thomas G. Mitchell, McFarland, (March 2015), Chapter 10 However, opponents in the Labor party (and even a few within his own Likud) viewed Netanyahu's policies as \\"Thatcherite\\" attacks on the venerated Israeli social safety net. Ultimately, unemployment declined while economic growth soared, the debt-to- GDP ratio dropped to one of the lowest in the world, and foreign investment reached record highs. Netanyahu threatened to resign from office in 2004 unless the Gaza pullout plan was put to a referendum. He later modified the ultimatum and voted for the program in the Knesset, indicating immediately thereafter that he would resign unless a referendum was held within 14 days. He submitted his resignation letter on 7 August 2005, shortly before the Israeli cabinet voted 17 to 5 to approve the initial phase of withdrawal from Gaza.  Return to leadership of Likud  Following the withdrawal of Sharon from the Likud, Netanyahu was one of several candidates who vied for the Likud leadership. His most recent attempt prior to this was in September 2005 when he had tried to hold early primaries for the position of the head of the Likud party, while the party held the office of Prime Minister ‚Äì thus effectively pushing Ariel Sharon out of office. The party rejected this initiative. Netanyahu retook the leadership on 20 December 2005, with 47% of the primary vote, to 32% for Silvan Shalom and 15% for Moshe Feiglin. In the March 2006 Knesset elections, Likud took the third place behind Kadima and Labor and Netanyahu served as Leader of the Opposition. On 14 August 2007, Netanyahu was reelected as chairman of the Likud and its candidate for the post of Prime Minister with 73% of the vote, against far-right candidate Moshe Feiglin and World Likud chairman Danny Danon. He opposed the 2008 Israel‚ÄìHamas ceasefire, like others in the Knesset opposition. Specifically, Netanyahu said, \\"This is not a relaxation, it's an Israeli agreement to the rearming of Hamas ... What are we getting for this?\\" In the first half of 2008, doctors removed a small colon polyp that proved to be benign. Following Tzipi Livni's election to head Kadima and Olmert's resignation from the post of Prime Minister, Netanyahu declined to join the coalition Livni was trying to form and supported new elections, which were held in February 2009. Netanyahu was the Likud's candidate for Prime Minister in the 2009 Israeli legislative election which took place on 10 February 2009, as Livni, the previous Designated Acting Prime Minister under the Olmert government, had been unable to form a viable governing coalition. Opinion polls showed Likud in the lead, but with as many as a third of Israeli voters undecided. In the election itself, Likud won the second highest number of seats, Livni's party having outnumbered the Likud by one seat. A possible explanation for Likud's relatively poor showing is that some Likud supporters defected to Avigdor Lieberman's Yisrael Beiteinu party. Netanyahu, however, claimed victory on the basis that right-wing parties won the majority of the vote, and on 20 February 2009, Netanyahu was designated by Israeli President Shimon Peres to succeed Ehud Olmert as prime minister, and began his negotiations to form a coalition government. Despite right wing parties winning a majority of 65 seats in the Knesset, Netanyahu preferred a broader centrist coalition and turned to his Kadima rivals, chaired by Tzipi Livni, to join his government. This time it was Livni's turn to decline to join, with a difference of opinion on how to pursue the peace process being the stumbling block. Netanyahu did manage to entice a smaller rival, the Labour party, chaired by Ehud Barak, to join his government, giving him a certain amount of centrist tone. Netanyahu presented his cabinet for a Knesset \\"Vote of Confidence\\" on 31 March 2009. The 32nd Government was approved that day by a majority of 69 lawmakers to 45 (with five abstaining) and the members were sworn in.  Second term as Prime Minister  Netanyahu in a meeting with President Dmitry Medvedev in Russia, 24 March 2011 Netanyahu with Yohanan Danino, appointed Israel's Chief of Police in 2011 In 2009, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton voiced support for the establishment of a Palestinian state ‚Äì a solution not endorsed by prime minister-designate Benjamin Netanyahu, with whom she had earlier pledged the United States' cooperation. Upon the arrival of President Obama administration's special envoy, George Mitchell, Netanyahu said that any furtherance of negotiations with the Palestinians would be conditioned on the Palestinians recognizing Israel as a Jewish state. During President Obama's Cairo speech on 4 June 2009 in which Obama addressed the Muslim world, Obama stated, among other things, \\"The United States does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements.\\" Following Obama's Cairo speech Netanyahu immediately called a special government meeting. On 14 June, ten days after Obama's Cairo speech, Netanyahu gave a speech at Bar-Ilan University in which he endorsed a \\"Demilitarized Palestinian State\\", though said that Jerusalem must remain the unified capital of Israel. Netanyahu stated that he would accept a Palestinian state if Jerusalem were to remain the united capital of Israel, the Palestinians would have no army, and the Palestinians would give up their demand for a right of return. He also argued the right for a \\"natural growth\\" in the existing Jewish settlements in the West Bank while their permanent status is up to further negotiation. Senior Palestinian official, Sereb Ereket, said that the speech had \\"closed the door to permanent status negotiations\\" due to Netanyahu's declarations on Jerusalem, refugees and settlements. Three months after starting his term, Netanyahu remarked that his cabinet already had achieved several notable successes, such as the establishment of a working national unity government, and a broad consensus for a \\"two-state solution\\". A July 2009 survey by Ha'aretz found that most Israelis supported the Netanyahu government, giving him a personal approval rating of about 49 percent. Netanyahu has lifted checkpoints in the West Bank in order to allow freedom of movement and a flow of imports; a step that resulted in an economic boost in the West Bank. In 2009, Netanyahu welcomed the Arab Peace initiative (also known as the \\"Saudi Peace Initiative\\") and lauded a call by Bahrain's Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa to normalize relations with Israel. In August 2009, Abbas declared that he would be willing to meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu at the UN General Assembly, where Netanyahu had accepted president Obama's invitation for a \\"triple summit\\", although he said it would not necessarily lead to negotiations. Netanyahu was reported to be in a pivotal moment over these understandings, that were reported to include a compromise over permission on continuing the already approved construction in the West Bank in exchange for freezing all settlements thereafter, as well as continuing building in East Jerusalem, and at the same time stopping the demolition of houses of Arab inhabitants there. On 4 September 2009, it was reported that Netanyahu was to agree to settlers' political demands to approve more settlement constructions before a temporary settlement freeze agreement took place. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs expressed \\"regret\\" over the move; however, one U.S. official said the move will not \\"derail [the] train\\". On 7 September 2009, Netanyahu left his office without reporting where he was headed. The prime minister's military secretary, Maj. Gen. Meir Kalifi, later reported Netanyahu had visited a security facility in Israel. Several different news agencies reported several different stories about where he was. On 9 September 2009, Yedioth Ahronoth reported that the Israeli leader had made a secret flight to Moscow to try to persuade Russian officials not to sell S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems to Iran. Headlines branded Netanyahu a \\"liar\\" and dubbed the affair a \\"fiasco\\". It was later reported that the PM's military secretary would be dismissed due to the affair. The Sunday Times reported that the trip was made to share the names of Russian scientists that Israel believes are abetting the alleged Iranian nuclear weapons program. On 24 September 2009, in an address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Netanyahu said Iran poses a threat to the peace of the world and that it is incumbent on the world body to prevent the Islamic Republic from obtaining nuclear weapons. Waving the blueprints for Auschwitz and invoking the memory of his own family members murdered by the Nazis, Netanyahu delivered a passionate and public riposte to Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's questioning of the Holocaust, asking: \\"Have you no shame?\\" In response to pressure from the Obama administration urging the sides to resume peace talks, on 25 November 2009 Netanyahu announced a partial 10-month settlement construction freeze plan. The announced partial freeze had no significant effect on actual settlement construction, according to an analysis by the major Israeli daily Haaretz. U.S. special envoy George Mitchell said, \\"while the United States shares Arab concerns about the limitations of Israel's gesture, it is more than any Israeli government has ever done\\". In his announcement Netanyahu called the move \\"a painful step that will encourage the peace process\\" and urged the Palestinians to respond. The Palestinians rejected the call, stating the gesture was \\"insignificant\\" in that thousands of recently approved settlement buildings in the West Bank would continue to be built and there would be no freeze of settlement activity in East Jerusalem. In March 2010, Israel's government approved construction of an additional 1,600 apartments in a large Jewish housing development in northern East Jerusalem called Ramat Shlomo despite the position of the current U.S. Government that acts such as this thwart the peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians. The Israeli government's announcement occurred during a visit by U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden and the U.S. government subsequently issued a strongly worded condemnation of the plan. Netanyahu subsequently issued a statement that all previous Israeli governments had continuously permitted construction in the neighborhood, and that certain neighborhoods such as Ramat Shlomo and Gilo have always been included as part of Israel in any final agreement plan that has been proposed by either side to date. Netanyahu regretted the timing of the announcement but asserted that \\"our policy on Jerusalem is the same policy followed by all Israeli governments for the 42 years, and it has not changed.\\" Netanyahu, Hillary Clinton, George J. Mitchell and Mahmoud Abbas at the start of the direct talks, 2 September 2010 In September 2010, Netanyahu agreed to enter direct talks, mediated by the Obama administration, with the Palestinians for the first time in a long while. The ultimate aim of these direct talks is to forge the framework of an official \\"final status settlement\\" to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict by forming a two-state solution for the Jewish people and the Palestinian people. On 27 September, the 10-month settlement freeze ended, and the Israeli government approved new construction in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. On retiring from office in July 2011, former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates had said that Netanyahu was ungrateful to the United States and endangering Israel. Responding, the Likud party defended Netanyahu by saying that most Israelis supported the Prime Minister and that he had broad support in the United States. Netanyahu unsuccessfully called for the early release of Jonathan Pollard, an American serving a life sentence for passing secret U.S. documents to Israel in 1987.Netanyahu And Foe Tangle Over Pollard, New York Daily News. He has raised the issue at the Wye River Summit in 1998, where he claimed that U.S. President Bill Clinton had privately agreed to release Pollard.Ross, Dennis. Statecraft: And How to Restore America's Standing in the World. 2008, p. 213Clinton, Bill. My Life: The Presidential Years. 2005, p. 468 In 2002, Netanyahu visited Pollard at his North Carolina prison. The Israeli Prime Minister maintained contact with Pollard's wife, and was active in pressing the Obama administration to release Pollard. In 2011, social justice protests broke out across Israel. Hundreds of thousands of people protested Israel's high cost of living throughout the country. In response, Netanyahu appointed the Trajtenberg Committee, headed by professor Manuel Trajtenberg, to examine the problems and propose solutions. The committee submitted recommendations to lower the high cost of living in September 2011. Although Netanyahu promised to push the proposed reforms through the cabinet in one piece, differences inside his coalition resulted in the reforms being gradually adopted. Netanyahu's cabinet also approved a plan to build a fiber-optic cable network across the country to bring cheap, high-speed fiber-optic Internet access to every home. In 2012, Netanyahu initially planned to call early elections, but subsequently oversaw the creation of a controversial government of national unity to see Israel through until the national elections of 2013. In May 2012, Netanyahu officially recognized for the first time the right for Palestinians to have their own state in an official document, a letter to Mahmoud Abbas, though as before he declared it would have to be demilitarized. On 25 October 2012, Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman announced that their respective political parties, Likud and Yisrael Beiteinu, had merged and would run together on a single ballot in Israel's 22 January 2013 general elections.  Third term as Prime Minister  The 2013 election returned Netanyahu's Likud Beiteinu coalition with 11 fewer seats than the combined Likud and Yisrael Beiteinu parties had going into the vote. Nevertheless, as leader of what remained the largest faction in the Knesset, Israeli president Shimon Peres charged Netanyahu with the task of forming the Thirty-third government of Israel. The new coalition included the Yesh Atid, The Jewish Home and Hatnuah parties and excludes the ultra-Orthodox parties at the insistence of Yesh Atid and the Jewish Home. During Netanyahu's third term, he continued his policy of economic liberalization. In December 2013, the Knesset approved the Business Concentration Law, which intended to open Israel's highly concentrated economy to competition to lower consumer prices, reduce income inequality, and increase economic growth. Netanyahu had formed the Concentration Committee in 2010, and the bill, which was pushed forward by his government, implemented its recommendations. The new law banned multi-tiered corporate holding structures, in which a CEO's family members or other affiliated individuals held public companies which in turn owned other public companies, and who were thus able to engage in price gouging. Under the law, corporations were banned from owning more than two tiers of publicly listed companies and from holding both financial and non-financial enterprises. All conglomerates were given four to six years to sell excess holdings. Netanyahu also began a campaign of port privatization to break what he viewed as the monopoly held by workers of the Israel Port Authority, so as to lower consumer prices and increase exports. In July 2013, he issued tenders for the construction of private ports in Haifa and Ashdod. Netanyahu has also pledged to curb excess bureaucracy and regulations to ease the burden on industry. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Netanyahu, Jerusalem, 23 July 2014 In April 2014, and again in June, Netanyahu spoke of his deep concerns when Hamas and the Palestinian Authority agreed and then formed a unity government, and was severely critical of both the United States and European governments' decision to work with the Palestinian coalition government.Peter Beaumont, \\"Israel condemns US for backing Palestinian unity government\\", The Guardian 3 June 2014] He blamed Hamas for the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June 2014, and launched a massive search and arrest operation on the West Bank, targeting members of Hamas in particular, and over the following weeks hit 60 targets in Gaza.James Marc Leas, 'Attack First, Kill First and Claim Self-Defense: Palestine Subcommittee Submission to UN Independent Commission of Inquiry on the 2014 Gaza Conflict,' Council for the National Interest 21 January 2015. Missile and rocket exchanges between Gaza militants and the IDF escalated after the bodies of the teenagers, who had been killed almost immediately as the government had good reasons to suspect, were discovered on 30 June 2014. After several Hamas operatives were killed, either in an explosion or from an Israeli bombing, Hamas officially declared it would launch rockets from Gaza into Israel, and Israel started Operation Protective Edge in the Gaza Strip, formally ending the November 2012 ceasefire agreement. The prime minister did a round of television shows in the United States and described Hamas as \\"genocidal terrorists\\" in an interview on CNN. When asked if Gazan casualties from the operation might spark \\"a third intifada\\", Netanyahu replied that Hamas was working towards that goal. In October 2014, Netanyahu's government approved a privatization plan to reduce corruption and politicization in government companies, and strengthen Israel's capital market. Under the plan, minority stakes of up to 49% in state-owned companies, including arms manufacturers, energy, postal, water, and railway companies, as well as the ports of Haifa and Ashdod. That same month, Netanyahu called restrictions on settlements \\"against the American values\\", a remark that earned him a sharp rebuke from the White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, who noted that American values had resulted in Israel receiving not only consistent funding but protective technology such as Iron Dome. Not long thereafter, Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic reported that the relationship between Netanyahu and the White House had reached a new low, with the U.S. administration angry over Israel's settlement policies, and Netanyahu expressing contempt for the American administration's grasp of the Middle East. Netanyahu explained that he does not accept restrictions on where Jews could live, and said that Jerusalem's Arabs and Jews should be able to buy homes wherever they want. He said he was \\"baffled\\" by the American condemnation. \\"It's against the American values. And it doesn't bode well for peace. The idea that we'd have this ethnic purification as a condition for peace, I think it's anti-peace.\\" On 2 December 2014, Netanyahu fired two of his ministers, Finance Minister Yair Lapid, who heads the centrist Yesh Atid party and Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, who heads Hatnua. The changes led to the dissolution of the government, with new elections expected on 17 March 2015. In January 2015, Netanyahu was invited to address the US Congress. This speech marked Netanyahu's third speech to a joint session of Congress. The day before announcing he would address Congress, Time reported that he tried to derail a meeting between U.S. lawmakers and the head of Mossad, Tamir Pardo, who intended warning them against imposing further sanctions against Iran, a move that might derail nuclear talks.\\"Report: Netanyahu tried to prevent Mossad briefing for US Senators on Iran\\", Ynet 15 March 2015.\\"Exclusive: Netanyahu Canceled Intel Briefing for U.S. Senators on Iran Dangers\\", Time 14 March 2015. Leading up to the speech, on 3 March 2015, Israeli consuls general in the United States \\"expect[ed] fierce negative reaction from U.S. Jewish communities and Israel's allies\\". Objections included the arrangement of the speech without the support and engagement of the Obama administration and the timing of the speech before Israel's 17 March 2015 election. Seven American Jewish lawmakers met with Ron Dermer, Israel's ambassador to the U.S. and recommended that Netanyahu instead meet with lawmakers privately to discuss Iran.Consuls in U.S. warn: Israel's friends fear Netanyahu's speech to Congress will harm ties Haaretz, 5 February 2015 In making the speech, Netanyahu claimed to speak for all Jews worldwide, a claim disputed by others in the Jewish community.Dianne Feinstein: Benjamin Netanyahu 'Arrogant' For Claiming To Speak For All Jews Huffington Post, 1 March 2015 J Street launches campaign against Netanyahu Times of Israel, 10 February 2015How dare Netanyahu speak in the name of America's Jews?

He said that support of a Palestinian state is tantamount to yielding territory for radical Islamic terrorists to attack Israel.Moran Azulay,\\"Netanyahu says no Palestinian state if he remains PM\\", Ynet 16 March 2015:'\\"Whoever moves to establish a Palestinian state or intends to withdraw from territory is simply yielding territory for radical Islamic terrorist attacks against Israel\\",' However, Netanyahu reiterated \\"I don't want a one-state solution.

President Rivlin granted Netanyahu an extension until 6 May 2015 to build a coalition when one had not been finalized in the first four weeks of negotiations.\\"Rivlin grants Netanyahu 2 week extension to form coalition\\", The Jerusalem Post, 20 April 2015 He formed a coalition government within two hours of the midnight 6 May deadline. His Likud party formed the coalition with Jewish Home, United Torah Judaism, Kulanu, and Shas. On 28 May 2015, Netanyahu announced that he would be running for an unprecedented fifth term as Prime Minister in the next general election and that he supports Likud's current process of picking MK candidates. In August 2015, Netanyahu's government approved a two-year budget that would see agricultural reforms and lowering of import duties to reduce food prices, deregulation of the approval process in construction to lower housing costs and speed up infrastructure building, and reforms in the financial sector to boost competition and lower fees for financial services. In the end, the government was forced to compromise by removing some key agricultural reforms. In October 2015, Netanyahu drew widespread criticism for claiming that the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, gave Adolf Hitler the idea for the Holocaust in the preceding months to the Second World War, convincing the Nazi leader to exterminate Jews rather than just expel them from Europe. This idea is dismissed by mainstream historians, who note that al-Husseini's meeting with Hitler took place approximately five months after the mass murder of Jews began. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she did not accept Netanyahu's claims, and reiterated an acceptance of her country's crimes during the Nazi era. Netanyahu later explained that his \\"aim was not to absolve Hitler from the responsibility he bears, but to show that the father of the Palestinian nation at the time, without a state and before the 'occupation,' without the territories and with the settlements, even then aspired with systemic incitement for the destruction of the Jews.\\" Some of the strongest criticism came from Israeli academics: Yehuda Bauer said Netanyahu's claim was \\"completely idiotic\\", while Moshe Zimmermann stated that \\"any attempt to deflect the burden from Hitler to others is a form of Holocaust denial.\\" In March 2016, Netanyahu's coalition faced a potential crisis as ultra-Orthodox members threatened to withdraw over the government's proposed steps to create non-Orthodox prayer space at the Western Wall. They have stated they will leave the coalition if the government offers any further official state recognition of Conservative and Reform Judaism.\\"Netanyahu facing crisis as haredim vow to quit over Western Wall pluralism\\". The Jerusalem Post, 7 March 2016 On 23 December 2016, the United States, under the Obama Administration, abstained from United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, effectively allowing it to pass. On 28 December, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry strongly criticized Israel and its settlement policies in a speech. Netanyahu strongly criticized both the UN Resolution and Kerry's speech in response. On 6 January 2017, the Israeli government withdrew its annual dues from the organization, which totaled $6 million in United States dollars. On 22 February 2017, Netanyahu became the first serving Prime Minister of Israel to visit Australia. He was accompanied by his wife, Sara. The three-day official visit included a delegation of business representatives, and Netanyahu and Prime Minister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull were scheduled to sign several bilateral agreements. Netanyahu recalled that it was the Australian Light Horse regiments that liberated Beersheba during World War 1, and this began what has been a relationship of 100 years between the countries.\\"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lands in Sydney amid controversy\\", ABC News Online, 22 February 2017 On 12 October 2017, shortly after the United States announced the same action, Netanyahu's government announced it was leaving UNESCO due to what it saw as anti-Israel actions by the agency, and it made that decision official in December 2017. The Israeli government officially notified UNESCO of the withdrawal in late December 2017. On 30 April 2018, Netanyahu accused Iran of not holding up its end of the Iran nuclear deal after presenting a cache of over 100,000 documents detailing the extent of Iran's nuclear program. Iran denounced Netanyahu's presentation as \\"propaganda\\". Netanyahu praised the 2018 North Korea‚ÄìUnited States summit. He said in a statement, \\"I commend US President Donald Trump on the historic summit in Singapore. This is an important step in the effort to rid the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons.\\" On 19 July 2018, the Knesset passed the Nation- State Bill, a Basic Law supported by Netanyahu's coalition government. Analysts saw the bill as a sign of Netanyahu's coalition advancing a right- wing agenda. Prior to the April 2019 Israeli legislative election, Netanyahu helped broker a deal that united the Jewish Home party with the far-right Otzma Yehudit party, in order to form the Union of the Right-Wing Parties. The motivation of the deal was to overcome the electoral threshold for smaller parties. The deal was criticized in the media, as Otzma is widely characterized as racist and traces its origins to the extremist Kahanist movement. Criminal investigations and indictment Since January 2017, Netanyahu has been investigated and questioned by Israeli police in two cases, \\"Case 1000\\" and \\"Case 2000\\". The two cases are connected. In Case 1000, Netanyahu is suspected of having obtained inappropriate favors from businessmen, including James Packer and Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan. Case 2000 involves alleged attempts to strike a deal with the publisher of the Yedioth Ahronot newspaper group, Arnon Mozes, to promote legislation to weaken Yedioth's main competitor, Israel Hayom, in exchange for more favorable coverage of Netanyahu. On 3 August 2017, Israeli police confirmed for the first time that Netanyahu was suspected of crimes involving fraud, breach of trust, and bribes in cases \\"1000\\" and \\"2000\\". The next day, it was reported that the Prime Minister's former chief of staff, Ari Harow, had signed a deal with prosecutors to testify against Netanyahu in these cases. Israelis protest against Netanyahu outside his official residence in Jerusalem on 30 July 2020 On 13 February 2018, Israeli police recommended that Netanyahu be charged with corruption. According to a police statement, sufficient evidence exists to indict the prime minister on charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust in the two cases. Netanyahu responded that the allegations were baseless and that he would continue as prime minister. On 25 November 2018, it was reported that Economic Crimes Division Director Liat Ben-Ari recommended indictment for both cases. On 28 February 2019, the Israeli attorney general announced his intent to file indictments against Netanyahu on bribe and fraud charges in three different cases. Netanyahu was formally indicted on 21 November 2019. If Netanyahu is convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison for bribery and a maximum of three years for fraud and breach of trust. He is the first sitting prime minister in Israel's history to be charged with a crime. On 23 November 2019, it was announced that Netanyahu, in compliance with legal precedent set by the Israeli Supreme Court in 1993, would relinquish his agriculture, health, social affairs and diaspora affairs portfolios. The matter of forcing a prime minister to resign due to an indictment has yet to be tested in court. He was officially charged on 28 January 2020. Netanyahu's criminal trial is set to begin on 24 May 2020, having been initially scheduled for March of that year but delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.  Fifth term as Prime Minister  On 17 May 2020, Netanyahu was sworn-in for a fifth term as prime minister in a coalition with Benny Gantz. This occurred after the 2019‚Äì20 Israeli political crisis. Against a background of the corona crisis and Netanyahu's criminal trial, extensive demonstrations broke out against him in front of the Prime Minister's residence. Following this, Netanyahu ordered to disperse the demonstrations using Corona special regulations, limiting them to 20 people and at a distance of 1,000 meters from their homes.Israel Parliament votes to restrict demonstrations amid 2nd national lockdown However, the exact opposite was achieved, the demonstrations were enlarged and dispersed to over 1,000 centers.\\"◊î◊ì◊í◊ú◊ô◊ù ◊î◊©◊ó◊ï◊®◊ô◊ù\\" ◊û◊§◊í◊ô◊†◊ô◊ù ◊ë◊û◊¢◊ú ◊ú◊õ-1,000 ◊û◊ï◊ß◊ì◊ô◊ù ◊ë◊®◊ó◊ë◊ô ◊î◊ê◊®◊•  Political positions   Economic views  Netanyahu has been described as \\"the advocate of the free-market\\".Beyond Regionalism?: Regional Cooperation, Regionalism and Regionalization in the Middle East, by Cilja Harders, Matteo Legrenzi (Ashgate 2013), p. 191 As Prime Minister in his first term, he significantly reformed the banking sector, removing barriers to investment abroad, mandatory purchases of government securities and direct credit. As Minister of Finance (2003‚Äì2005), Netanyahu introduced a major overhaul of the Israeli economy. He introduced a welfare to work program, he led a program of privatization, reduced the size of the public sector, reformed and streamlined the taxation system and passed laws against monopolies and cartels with the aim of increasing competition. Netanyahu extended capital gains taxes from companies to individuals, which allowed him to enlarge the tax base while reducing taxes on incomes.Arik: The Life of Ariel Sharon, By David Landau, (Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group 2014), Chapter 14 As the Israeli economy started booming and unemployment fell significantly, Netanyahu was widely credited by commentators as having performed an 'economic miracle' by the end of his tenure. Direct investment in the Israeli economy had increased by an annualized 380%.Foreign investment in Israel at record levels Globes, 26 September 2005, Zeev Klein On the other hand, his critics have labelled his economic views as Margaret Thatcher-inspired \\"popular capitalism\\".The Political Right in Israel: Different Faces of Jewish Populism, by Dani Filc, (Routledge, 2009), p. 65 Netanyahu defines capitalism as \\"the ability to have individual initiative and competition to produce goods and services with profit, but not to shut out somebody else from trying to do the same\\". He says that his views developed while he was working as an economic consult for Boston Consulting Group: \\"It was the first time that the Boston Consulting Group looked at governments and worked for governments. They wanted to do a strategic plan for the government of Sweden. I was on that case and looked at other governments. So I went around to other governments in Europe in 1976 and I was looking at Britain. I was looking at France. I was looking at other countries, and I could see that they were stymied by concentrations of power that prevented competition. And I thought, hmm, as bad as they are, ours was worse because we had very little room for private sector competition to the extent that we had government-controlled or union-controlled companies, and so you really didn't get the competition or the growth ... And I said, well, if I ever have a chance, I'll change that.\\"  Views on counter-terrorism  Netanyahu has said his own \\"hard line against all terrorists\\" came as a result of his brother's death. Yoni Netanyahu had been killed while leading the hostage-rescue mission at Operation Entebbe.Thomas, Gordon. Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad, Macmillan Publishers (2009) p. 145 In addition to having taken part in counter-terrorist operations during his service in the military, Netanyahu has published three books on the subject of fighting terrorism. He identifies terrorism as a form of totalitarianism, writing: \\"The more far removed the target of the attack from any connection to the grievance enunciated by the terrorists, the greater the terror ... Yet for terrorism to have any impact, it is precisely the lack of connection, the lack of any possible involvement or \\"complicity\\" of the chosen victims in the cause the terrorists seek to attack, that produces the desired fear. For terrorism's underlying message is that every member of society is \\"guilty\\", that anyone can be a victim, and that therefore no one is safe ... In fact, the methods reveal the totalitarian strain that runs through all terrorist groups ... It is not only that the ends of the terrorists do not succeed in justifying the means they choose; their choice of means indicate what their true ends are. Far from being fighters for freedom, terrorists are the forerunners of tyranny. Terrorists use the techniques of violent coercion in order to achieve a regime of violent coercion.\\" Netanyahu cautions that \\"[t]he trouble with active anti-terror activities ... is that they do constitute a substantial intrusion on the lives of those being monitored.\\" He believes there is a balance between civil liberties and security, which should depend on the level of sustained terrorist attacks in a country. During periods of sustained attack, there should be shift towards security, due to \\"the monstrous violation of personal rights which is the lot of the victims of terror and their families\\". But this should be regularly reviewed, with an emphasis on guarding civil liberties and individual privacy wherever and whenever security considerations allow: \\"The concern of civil libertarians over possible infringements of the rights of innocent citizens is well placed, and all additional powers granted the security services should require annual renewal by the legislature, this in addition to judicial oversight of actions as they are taken in the field.\\" He advises tighter immigration laws as an essential tool to preemptively combat terrorism: \\"This era of immigration free-for-all should be brought to an end. An important aspect of taking control of the immigration situation is stricter background checks of potential immigrants, coupled with the real possibility of deportation.\\" He also cautions that it is essential that governments do not conflate terrorists with those legitimate political groups that may or may not hold extremist views, but which advance their positions by means of debate and argument: \\"Democracies have their share of anti-immigrant or anti-establishment parties, as well as advocates of extreme nationalism or internationalism ... [T]hey are often genuinely convinced participants in democracy, accepting its basic ground rules and defending its central tenets. These can and must be distinguished from the tiny splinters at the absolute fringes of democratic society, which may endorse many similar ideas, but use them as a pretext to step outside the rubric of the democratic system\\". In particular, Ronald Reagan was an admirer of Netanyahu's work on counter-terrorism, and Reagan recommended Netanyahu's book Terrorism: How the West Can Win to all senior figures in his administration.David Margolick (June 1996), \\"Star of Zion\\", Vanity Fair  Death penalty  In 2017 Netanyahu called for the death penalty to be imposed on the perpetrator of the 2017 Halamish stabbing attack. Representatives in his government introduced a bill which would allow the death penalty for terrorism to the Knesset. In January 2018, 52 of 120 members of the Israeli parliament voted in favor while 49 opposed, making it easier for judges to hand down the death penalty.  LGBT rights  Netanyahu supports equal rights before the law for LGBT citizens, stating: \\"The struggle for every person to be recognized as equal before the law is a long struggle, and there is still a long way to go ... I am proud that Israel is among the most open countries in the world in relation to the LGBT community discourse.\\"PM to LGBT community: Israel among world's most open countries 6 November 2015, The Jerusalem Post During an event held for the annual community rights day at the Knesset, Netanyahu proclaimed that he was \\"asked to come here in the middle of my busy schedule to say one thing to the male and female members of the LGBT community: We must be guided by the conviction that every person is created in the image of God.\\"\\"Knesset marks Gay Community Rights Day; PM Netanyahu: 'We must be guided by the conviction that every person is created in the image of God Publicized: 23 February 2016, Knesset Press Releases However, in his coalition government, many of his coalition government party members opposed same-sex marriage.  Ethiopian Jewish integration  Netanyahu at a memorial service of Ethiopian Israeli immigrants, in honor of their friends who died on their way to Israel. In 2015, after Ethiopian Jewish protests against police brutality, Netanyahu said: \\"We will bring a comprehensive plan to the government to assist you in every way.

We will turn racism into something contemptible and despicable.\\"Judah Ari Gross (17 May 2015), \\"Israel failed Ethiopian community, president says at memorial\\" The Times of Israel  African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem  Netanyahu supports the integration of the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem into Israeli society, and takes part in celebrations in honor of this community's \\"exodus\\" from America to Israel, which occurred in 1967. In 2012, Netanyahu expressed appreciation towards \\"the cooperative society that is working towards the inclusion of the Hebrew Israelite community in Israeli society at large,\\" and declared that the experience of the community in the land of Israel is \\"an integral part of the Israeli experience.\\"Andrew Esensten (25 May 2012) \\"African Hebrew Israelites mark their modern day exodus from U.S\\". Haaretz  Peace process  Netanyahu opposed the Oslo accords from their inception. In 1993, he dedicated a chapter, entitled \\"Trojan Horse\\", of his book A Place Among the Nations to argue against the Oslo Peace Process. He asserted that Amin al-Husseini had been one of the masterminds of the Holocaust, and that Yasser Arafat was heir to the former's \\"alleged exterminationist Nazism\\". During his term as prime minister in the late 1990s, Netanyahu consistently reneged on commitments made by previous Israeli governments as part of the Oslo peace process, leading American peace envoy Dennis Ross to note that \\"neither President Clinton nor Secretary [of State Madeleine] Albright believed that Bibi had any real interest in pursuing peace.\\" In a 2001 video, Netanyahu, reportedly unaware he was being recorded, said: \\"They asked me before the election if I'd honor [the Oslo Accords]\\", \\"I said I would, but ... I'm going to interpret the accords in such a way that would allow me to put an end to this galloping forward to the '67 borders. How did we do it? Nobody said what defined military zones were. Defined military zones are security zones; as far as I'm concerned, the entire Jordan Valley is a defined military zone. Go argue.\\" On 9 August 2009, speaking at the opening of his weekly cabinet meeting, Netanyahu promised not to repeat the \\"mistake\\" of the Gaza unilateral pullout, saying, \\"We will not repeat this mistake. We will not create new evacuees\\", and adding that \\"the unilateral evacuation brought neither peace nor security. On the contrary\\", and that \\"We want an agreement with two factors, the first of which is the recognition of Israel as the national state of the Jewish people and [the second is] a security settlement. In the case of Gaza, both of these factors were lacking\\". He also said, \\"Should we achieve a turn toward peace with the more moderate partners, we will insist on the recognition of the State of Israel and the demilitarization of the future Palestinian state\\". In October 2014, Netanyahu said \\"We don't just hand over territory, close our eyes and hope for the best. We did that in Lebanon and we got thousands of rockets. We did that in Gaza, we got Hamas and 15,000 rockets. So we're not gonna just replicate that. We want to see genuine recognition of the Jewish state and rock solid security arrangements on the ground. That's the position I've held, and it's only become firmer.\\"Dovid Efune, Netanyahu Says Stance On Security Requirements Has Become 'Firmer', Algemeiner Journal, 6 October 2014. One of Netanyahu's campaign posters during the 2009 Israeli legislative elections which stated that he would be the strongest choice for Israel's economy and security Netanyahu had previously called U.S.-backed peace talks a waste of time, while at the same time refusing to commit to the same two-state solution as had other Israeli leaders, until a speech in June 2009. He repeatedly made public statements which advocated an \\"economic peace\\" approach, meaning an approach based on economic cooperation and joint effort rather than continuous contention over political and diplomatic issues. This is in line with many significant ideas from the Peace Valley plan. He raised these ideas during discussions with former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Netanyahu continued to advocate these ideas as the Israeli elections approached. Netanyahu has said: > Right now, the peace talks are based on only one thing, only on peace talks. > It makes no sense at this point to talk about the most contractible issue. > It's Jerusalem or bust, or right of return or bust. That has led to failure > and is likely to lead to failure again ... We must weave an economic peace > alongside a political process. That means that we have to strengthen the > moderate parts of the Palestinian economy by handing rapid growth in those > areas, rapid economic growth that gives a stake for peace for the ordinary > Palestinians.\\" In January 2009, prior to the February 2009 Israeli elections Netanyahu informed Middle East envoy Tony Blair that he would continue the policy of the Israeli governments of Ariel Sharon and Ehud Olmert by expanding settlements in the West Bank, in contravention of the Road Map, but not building new ones. White House Abraham Accords signing ceremony on September 15, 2020 In 2013, Netanyahu denied reports that his government would agree to peace talks on the basis of the green line. In 2014 he agreed to the American framework based on the green line and said that Jewish settlers must be allowed the option of staying in their settlements under Palestinian rule. In 2014, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat criticized Netanyahu, calling him \\"ideologically corrupt\\" and a war criminal. In January 2020, Netanyahu publicly supported Trump's Israeli-Palestinian peace plan for the creation of the State of Palestine. Former United States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said that in May 22, 2017, Netanyahu showed Donald Trump a fake and altered video of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas calling for the killing of children. This was at a time when Trump was considering if Israel was the obstacle to peace. Netanyahu had showed Trump the fake video to change his position in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/netanyahu-used- doctored-video-of-abbas-to-influence-trump-s-policy-woodward-reveals-1.9149688 Netanyahu publicly supported the Trump peace plan for the creation of the State of Palestine. The U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords agreed to the full normalization of relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates (the Israel‚ÄìUnited Arab Emirates normalization agreement) and Bahrain, respectively (the Bahrain‚ÄìIsrael normalization agreement). This was the first time any Arab country had normalized relations with Israel since Jordan in 1994. The accords were signed by Bahrain's foreign minister, UAE's foreign minister and Netanyahu on September 15, 2020 at the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, D.C. = Bar-Ilan speech = On 14 June 2009, Netanyahu delivered a seminal address at Bar-Ilan University (also known as the \\"Bar- Ilan speech\\"), at Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies, that was broadcast live in Israel and across parts of the Arab world, on the topic of the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian peace process. He endorsed for the first time the notion of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. Netanyahu's speech could be viewed in part as a response to Obama's 4 June speech at Cairo. Yedioth Ahronoth claimed that Obama's words had \\"resonated through Jerusalem's corridors\\". As part of his proposal, Netanyahu demanded the full demilitarization of the proposed state, with no army, rockets, missiles, or control of its airspace, and said that Jerusalem would be undivided Israeli territory. He stated that the Palestinians should recognize Israel as the Jewish national state with an undivided Jerusalem. He rejected a right of return for Palestinian refugees, saying, \\"any demand for resettling Palestinian refugees within Israel undermines Israel's continued existence as the state of the Jewish people.\\" He also stated that a complete stop to settlement building in the West Bank, as required by the 2003 Road Map peace proposal, was not possible and the expansions will be limited based on the \\"natural growth\\" of the population, including immigration, with no new territories taken in. Nevertheless, Netanyahu affirmed that he accepted the Road Map proposal. He did not discuss whether or not the settlements should be part of Israel after peace negotiations, simply stating that the \\"question will be discussed\\". In a response to U.S. President Barack Obama's statements in his Cairo speech, Netanyahu remarked, \\"there are those who say that if the Holocaust had not occurred, the State of Israel would never have been established. But I say that if the State of Israel would have been established earlier, the Holocaust would not have occurred.\\" He also said, \\"this is the homeland of the Jewish people, this is where our identity was forged.\\" He stated that he would be willing to meet with any \\"Arab leader\\" for negotiations without preconditions, specifically mentioning Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Lebanon. In general, the address represented a new position for Netanyahu's government on the peace process. Some right-wing members of Netanyahu's governing coalition criticized his remarks for the creation of a Palestinian State, believing that all of the land should come under Israeli sovereignty. Likud MK Danny Danon said that Netanyahu went \\"against the Likud platform\\", while MK Uri Orbach of Habayit Hayehudi said that it had \\"dangerous implications\\". Opposition party Kadima leader Tzipi Livni remarked after the address that she thinks Netanyahu does not really believe in the two-state solution at all; she thought that he only said what he did as a feigned response to international pressure. Peace Now criticized the speech, highlighting that, in the group's opinion, it did not address the Palestinians as equal partners in the peace process. The Secretary General of Peace Now, Yariv Oppenheimer, said, \\"It's a rerun of Netanyahu from his first term\\". On 9 August 2009, speaking at the opening of a government meeting, Netanyahu repeated his claims from the Palestinians: \\"We want an agreement with two factors, the first of which is the recognition of Israel as the national state of the Jewish people and (the second of which is) a security settlement\\". Netanyahu's \\"Bar-Ilan speech\\" provoked mixed reaction from the international community. The Palestinian National Authority rejected the conditions on a Palestinian State given by Netanyahu. Senior official Saeb Erekat said, \\"Netanyahu's speech closed the door to permanent status negotiations\\". Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said it reflected a \\"racist and extremist ideology\\" and called on Arab nations to \\"form stronger opposition\\". Palestinian Islamic Jihad labeled it \\"misleading\\" and, like Hamas, demanded stronger opposition to Israel from Arab nations. According to The Jerusalem Post, some leaders advocated a third intifada in response to the speech. The Arab League dismissed the address, declaring in a statement that \\"Arabs would not make concessions regarding issues of Jerusalem and refugees\\" and that \\"we know his history and style of evasion\\", adding that the Arab League would not recognize Israel as a Jewish state. Referring to Netanyahu's demand that Palestinians recognize Israel as the state of the Jewish people, Egypt's president Hosni Mubarak remarked, \\"You won't find anyone to answer that call in Egypt, or in any other place.\\" Issuing a less blunt response, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry said that the speech was \\"not complete\\" and that it hoped for another, \\"different Israeli proposal which is built on the commitment to the two-state solution\\". Syrian state media condemned the speech and wrote that \\"Netanyahu has confirmed that he rejects the Arab peace initiative for peace along with all the initiatives and resolutions of the Security Council to relative peace.\\" Lebanese President Michel Suleiman called for unity among Arab leaders, saying that \\"Arab leaders should be more united and preserve the spirit of resistance to face the Israeli stands regarding the peace process and the Palestinian refugee issue.\\" He called on the international community to exert more pressure on the Israeli government to accept the Arab Peace Initiative, as he said \\"Israel still has a will of military confrontation which can be proved in its offensives on Lebanon and the Gaza Strip.\\" Jordanian Minister of State for Media affairs and Communications, and Government spokesperson Nabil Sharif issued a statement saying \\"The ideas presented by Netanyahu do not live up to what was agreed on by the international community as a starting point for achieving a just and comprehensive peace in the region.\\" Former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad referred to the speech as \\"bad news\\". The Czech Republic praised Netanyahu's address. \\"In my view, this is a step in the right direction. The acceptance of a Palestinian state was present there,\\" said Czech Foreign Minister Jan Kohout, whose country held the EU's six-month presidency at the time of the speech. President Barack Obama's press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said that the speech was an \\"important step forward\\". President Obama stated that \\"this solution can and must ensure both Israel's security and the Palestinians' legitimate aspirations for a viable state\\". Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt stated that \\"the fact that he uttered the word state is a small step forward\\". He added that \\"whether what he mentioned can be defined as a state is a subject of some debate\\". France praised the speech but called on Israel to cease building settlements in the West Bank. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner stated, \\"I can only welcome the prospect of a Palestinian state outlined by the Israeli Prime Minister.\\" The Foreign Ministry of Russia called the speech \\"a sign of readiness for dialogue\\" but said that \\"it does not open up the road to resolving the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian problem. The conditions on the Palestinians would be unacceptable.\\"  Iran  In an 8 March 2007 interview with CNN, opposition leader Netanyahu claimed that \\"there is only one difference between Nazi Germany and the Islamic Republic of Iran, namely that the first entered a worldwide conflict and then sought atomic weapons, while the latter is first seeking atomic weapons and, once it has them, will then start a world war.\\" Netanyahu repeated these remarks at a news conference in April 2008. This was similar to earlier remarks that \\"it's 1938, and Iran is Germany, and Iran is racing to arm itself with atomic bombs\\". On 20 February 2009, after being asked to be the prime minister of Israel, Netanyahu described Iran as the greatest threat that Israel has ever faced: \\"Iran is seeking to obtain a nuclear weapon and constitutes the gravest threat to our existence since the war of independence.\\" Speaking before the UN General Assembly in New York on 24 September 2009, Netanyahu expressed a different opinion than Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's speech at the forum, saying those who believe Tehran is a threat only to Israel are wrong. \\"The Iranian regime\\", he said, \\"is motivated by fanaticism ... They want to see us go back to medieval times. The struggle against Iran pits civilization against barbarism. This Iranian regime is fueled by extreme fundamentalism.\\" \\"By focusing solely on Iran,\\" columnist Yossi Melman speculated that Netanyahu's foreign policy, \\"... took the Palestinian issue off the world agenda.\\" After four days of shelling from the Iranian-funded Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Melman asked, \\"Is it worth initiating a crisis with Iran? Will the Israeli public be able to cope with Iran's response?\\" According to Uzi Eilam, a retired brigadier general and the ex-director of Israel's Atomic Energy Commission, Benjamin Netanyahu is using the threat of atomic Iran as a means of reaching his own goals. Directly blaming Netanyahu, he said: \\"Netanyahu is using the Iranian threat to achieve a variety of political objectives.\\" He also said: \\"These declarations are unnecessarily scaring Israel's citizens, given Israel is not party to the negotiations to determine whether Iran will or will not dismantle its nuclear program.\\" Israeli Minister of Defense Ehud Barak, Netanyahu holds an Iranian instruction manual for the anti-ship missile captured in Victoria Affair, March 2011 By 2012, Netanyahu is reported to have formed a close, confidential relationship with Defense Minister Ehud Barak as the two men considered possible Israeli military action against Iran's nuclear facilities, following Israel's established Begin Doctrine. The pair were accused of acting on \\"messianic\\" impulses by Yuval Diskin, former head of the Shin Bet, who added that their warmongering rhetoric appealed to \\"the idiots within the Israeli public\\". Diskin's remarks were supported by former Mossad chief Meir Dagan, who himself had previously said that an attack on Iran was \\"the stupidest thing I have ever heard\\". A few weeks later, the RAND Corporation (a leading American think-tank that advises the Pentagon) also openly disagreed with Netanyahu's belligerent stance: \\"In doing so, and without naming names, RAND sided with former Mossad chief Meir Dagan and former head of the Shin Bet Yuval Diskin.\\" Early in 2012, he used the opening ceremony for Israel's Holocaust Remembrance Day to warn against the dangers of an Iranian nuclear bomb, saying he was following the example of Jewish leaders during World War II who struggled to raise the alarm about the Nazis' genocidal intentions. Israeli academic Avner Cohen accused Netanyahu of showing \\"contempt\\" for the Holocaust by putting it to \\"political use\\", and former Israeli foreign minister Shlomo Ben-Ami similarly condemned Netanyahu's \\"vulgar manipulation of the memory of the Holocaust\\". Immediately after the 2012 Burgas bus bombing, Netanyahu confirmed that the attack had been undertaken in coordination with Iran. U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel, Tehran, 11 December 2017 Netanyahu stated during a 29 July meeting that, in his opinion, \\"all the sanctions and diplomacy so far have not set back the Iranian programme by one iota\\". And in August he stated that the United States only might respond to a massive attack against Israel. On 28 September 2012, Netanyahu gave a speech to the UN General Assembly in which he set forward a \\"red line\\" of 90% uranium enrichment, stating that if Iran were to reach this level, it would become an intolerable risk for Israel. Netanyahu used a cartoon graphic of a bomb to illustrate his point, indicating three stages of uranium enrichment, noting that Iran had already completed the first stage, and stating that \\"By next spring, at most by next summer at current enrichment rates, [Iran] will have finished the medium enrichment and move on to the final stage. From there, it's only a few months, possibly a few weeks before they get enough enriched uranium for the first bomb.\\" Netanyahu delivered his speech the day after Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad spoke on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, a presentation that the American, Canadian, and Israeli delegations had deliberately not attended. At the time, according to cables leaked in 2015, Mossad's assessment was that Iran did not appear ready to enrich uranium to levels required for a nuclear bomb.Seumas Milne, Ewen MacAskill and Clayton Swisher, 'Leaked cables show Netanyahu‚Äôs Iran bomb claim contradicted by Mossad,' The Guardian 23 February 2015. In an October 2013 interview with BBC Persian Service, Netanyahu praised the history of Persia and said: \\"If the Iranian regime has nuclear weapons, the Iranian people will never be free of dictatorship and will live in eternal servitude.\\" The U.S. military's 2020 Baghdad International Airport airstrike, which killed the high-level Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, brought strong reactions from around the world. Netanyahu praised the air strike, saying that Trump had acted \\"swiftly, forcefully and decisively\\".  Bank of China terror financing case  In 2013, Netanyahu found himself caught between conflicting commitments made to the family of American terror victim Daniel Wultz and the Government of China. Although Netanyahu was reported to have previously promised U.S. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen that Israel would fully cooperate in the terror-financing case against Bank of China in U.S. District Court, the prime minister reportedly made a conflicting promise to the Government of China prior to a state visit to China in May 2013. Attorney David Boies, lead counsel for the Wultz family, told The Wall Street Journal, \\"While we are respectful of China's interests, and of the diplomatic pressure to which Israel has been subjected, those interests and that pressure cannot be permitted to obstruct the ability of American courts to hear critical evidence.\\" In August 2013, Ros-Lehtinen, chair of the House Middle East and South Asia subcommittee, told the Miami Herald she raised the issue while leading a congressional delegation to Israel, stressing to Israeli officials the importance of them providing the Wultz family what they need for their lawsuit. \\"I am hopeful that we can bring this case to a conclusion that is satisfactory to the family, but we need community support to not waver at this critical time,\\" Ros-Lehtinen said. U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chair of the Democratic National Committee, also spoke out on the issue with the Miami Herald: \\"In South Florida, we all know too well of the tragic circumstances surrounding the cowardly terrorist attack that took Daniel Wultz's innocent life. I have been working, hand in hand with the Wultz family and the state of Israel to ensure any and all of those involved in this terrorist activity, including the Bank of China, pay for their crimes so that justice can be served.\\"  Defense and security  Israelis in Ashkelon run for shelter following a missile alert during Operation Protective Edge In 2011, Netanyahu arranged for 1000 Hamas and Fatah prisoners to be swapped for Gilad Shalit, including terrorists with \\"blood on their hands\\". Israeli officials estimate that 60% of those who are released \\"resume terrorism attacks\\". In 2011, Israeli General Staff concluded that the armed forces cannot maintain their battle readiness under Netanyahu's proposed cuts.Harel, Amos. \\"IDF battle readiness to suffer if budget cut, senior officers warn\\". Haaretzr, 11 October 2011. However Netanyahu decided to cut social programs instead, and promised to increase the defense budget by about six percent. In spite of this, the Israeli military still fell NIS 3.7 million short from its projected budget, which could damage their war capabilities.Harel, Amos. \\"IDF to ground warplanes, freeze Iron Dome production over budget woes\\". Haaretz. 12 February 2012. According to a U.S. State Department representative in November 2011, under the leadership of Netanyahu and Obama, Israel and the United States have enjoyed unprecedented security cooperation.Shapiro, Andrew J. \\"Ensuring Israel's Qualitative Military Edge\\". U.S. State Department, 4 November 2011. Under Netanyahu's leadership, the Israeli National Security Council has seen an expanded role in foreign policy planning and decision- making. Illegal immigration In his 1995 book Fighting Terrorism: How Democracies Can Defeat Domestic and International Terrorism, Netanyahu strongly argued that tightening immigration laws in the West is the most effective method to combat terrorism. \\"This era of immigration free-for-all should be brought to an end\\", he wrote in 1995. In 2012 the Netanyahu government passed the \\"Prevention of Infiltration Law\\", which mandated automatic detention of all people, including asylum-seekers, who enter Israel without permission. Amnesty International called it \\"an affront to international law\\". Between 2009 and 2013, approximately 60,000 people crossed into Israel from various African countries. Netanyahu said that, \\"this phenomenon is very grave and threatens the social fabric of society, our national security and our national identity.\\"\\"Israel PM: illegal African immigrants threaten identity of Jewish state\\". The Guardian. 20 May 2012. Many of these migrants are held in detention camps in the Negev desert.\\"'We are prisoners here', say migrants at Israel's desert detention camp\\". The Daily Telegraph. 4 April 2014. When the Supreme Court of Israel declared the \\"Prevention of Infiltration Law\\" illegal for permitting immediate and indefinite detention of asylum seekers from Africa, Netanyahu requested new legislation to work around the Supreme Court ruling.Jewish refugee organization slams Netanyahu on asylum seekers Haaretz, 10 October 2014 Netanyahu is critical of what he sees as the overly open immigration policy of EU nations. Netanyahu has urged the leaders of Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Poland to close their borders to illegal immigration.  Personal life   Family  Benjamin Netanyahu at the grave of his brother Yoni Netanyahu, who was killed leading a counter-terrorist operation in 1976  Family and background  Netanyahu was born in Tel Aviv, to Prof. Benzion Netanyahu (original name Mileikowsky) and Tzila (Cela; n√©e Segal). His mother was born in 1912 in Petah Tikva, then in Ottoman Palestine, now Israel. Though all his grandparents were born in the Russian Empire (now Belarus, Lithuania and Poland), his mother's parents emigrated to Minneapolis in the United States. He is related to Rabbi Eliyahu of Vilna (the Vilna Gaon) on his paternal side. Netanyahu's father, Benzion, was a professor of Jewish history at Cornell University, editor of the Encyclopaedia Hebraica, and a senior aide to Ze'ev Jabotinsky, who remained active in research and writing into his nineties. Regarding the Palestinian people, he stated: \\"That they won't be able to face [anymore] the war with us, which will include withholding food from Arab cities, preventing education, terminating electrical power and more. They won't be able to exist, and they will run away from here. But it all depends on the war, and whether we will win the battles with them.\\" Netanyahu's paternal grandfather was Nathan Mileikowsky, a leading Zionist rabbi and JNF fundraiser. Netanyahu's older brother, Yonatan, was killed in Uganda during Operation Entebbe in 1976. His younger brother, Iddo, is a radiologist and writer. All three brothers served in the Sayeret Matkal reconnaissance unit of the Israel Defense Forces.  Marriages and relationships  Netanyahu lighting Hanukkah candles on the first night in the Prime Minister's office in Jerusalem with his wife, Sara and their sons, Yair and Avner, 1996 Netanyahu has been married three times. Netanyahu's first marriage was to Miriam Weizmann, whom he met in Israel. Weizmann lived near Yonatan Netanyahu's apartment in Jerusalem, where Netanyahu was based during his military service. By the time Netanyahu's service was finished, Weizmann had completed her own military service and a degree in chemistry from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1972, they both left to study in the United States, where she enrolled in Brandeis University, while Netanyahu studied at MIT. They married soon afterward. The couple had one daughter, Noa (born 29 April 1978). In 1978, while Weizmann was pregnant, Netanyahu met a non-Jewish British student named Fleur Cates at the university library, and began an affair. His marriage ended in divorce soon afterward, when his wife Miriam discovered the affair. In 1981, Netanyahu married Cates, and she converted to Judaism. The couple divorced in 1984. His third wife, Sara Ben-Artzi, was working as a flight attendant on an El Al flight from New York to Israel when they met. She was in the process of completing a master's degree in psychology. The couple married in 1991. They have two sons: Yair (born 26 July 1991), a former soldier in the IDF Spokesperson's Unit, and Avner (born 10 October 1994), a national Bible champion and winner of the National Bible Quiz for Youth in Kiryat Shmona and former soldier in the IDF Combat Intelligence Collection Corps.https://www.jpost.com/not-just-news/shine-your-shoes- netanyahus-youngest-son-begins-army-service-383308 In 1993, Netanyahu confessed on live television to having had an affair with Ruth Bar, his public relations adviser. He said that a political rival had planted a secret video camera that had recorded him in a sexually compromising position with Bar, and that he had been threatened with the release of the tape to the press unless he quit the Likud leadership race. Netanyahu and Sara repaired their marriage, and he was elected to the leadership of Likud. In 1996, the media reported that he had a 20-year friendship with Katherine Price-Mondadori, an Italian- American woman.\\"Who Fired the Prime Minister's Nanny? The Soup Thickens\\", by Jack Katzenell, Associated Press, 7 July 1996 During the 1990s, Netanyahu criticized this media intrusion into his private life, claiming that political rivals including David Levy had hired spies to try to gather evidence of alleged affairs. The Israeli public are generally not interested in their politicians' private lives and would prefer they remained private.Politics and Society in Modern Israel: Myths and Realities, By Adam Garfinkle, M.E. Sharpe, 7 December 1999, p. 194. On 1 October 2009, his daughter Noa Netanyahu-Roth (married to Daniel Roth) gave birth to a boy, Shmuel. In 2011, Noa and her husband Daniel had a second son named David, and in 2016 had a daughter. Noa is a baalat teshuva (someone born to a secular family who returned to Orthodox Judaism) and lives in Mea Shearim with her family.  Relations with foreign leaders  Netanyahu and Barack Obama Netanyahu has a close relationship with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n, their having known each other for decades due to the privileged relationship between the Likud Party and the EPP, the European People's Party. Orban particularly admired Netanyahu while he was working as Finance Minister, and received advice from him while Netanyahu was Finance Minister of Israel.Hungarian PM: We share the same security concerns as Israel Friday 21 July 2017, Israel Hayom Netanyahu has been noted for his close and friendly relationship with then Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.Akiva Eldar (14 June 2011), \\"Netanyahu has joined his buddy Berlusconi in an alliance of rejects\\", Haaretz Netanyahu has said of Berlusconi: \\"We are lucky that there is a leader such as yourself.\\"Netanyahu to Berlusconi: Israel lucky to have you as a friend Aviad Glickman 02.01.10 Netanyahu has described Berlusconi as \\"one of the greatest friends\\".Berlusconi says Israel should be an EU member Telegraph, 2 February 2010 Netanyahu has a warm relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, touting their \\"personal friendship\\" in April 2019. During the 2011 G-20 Cannes summit, then French president Nicolas Sarkozy was overheard saying to then U.S. President Barack Obama, \\"I cannot bear Netanyahu, he's a liar\\", and Obama reportedly responded, \\"You're fed up with him, but I have to deal with him every day.\\"Report: Sarkozy calls Netanyahu 'liar' Ynet News, 7 November 2011.Sarkozy to Obama: I'm fed up with Netanyahu, CBS News, 8 November 2011. Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump have known each other for many years.Donald Trump invites Benjamin Netanyahu to US after Israeli PM congratulates 'true friend of Israel' Lizzie Dearden, The Independent, 11/11/16 Netanyahu had been a friend of Donald Trump's father when Netanyahu lived in New York during the 1980s, serving as UN ambassador. In 2013, Trump made a video endorsing Netanyahu during the Israeli elections saying, \\"vote for Benjamin ‚Äì terrific guy, terrific leader, great for Israel\\". In June 2019, Netanyahu officially renamed a settlement in the disputed Golan Heights after Donald Trump. Netanyahu has close ties with the congressional leadership of the U.S. Republican Party and with its 2012 presidential candidate, Mitt Romney. He and Romney first became acquainted when both worked at the Boston Consulting Group in the mid-1970s. Former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, a Democrat, has been friendly with Netanyahu for many years. In November 2011 and in the 2012 U.S. vice presidential debate, Biden stated that the relationship has lasted for 39 years. Netanyahu remarked in March 2010 during a joint statement with Biden during his visit of Israel that their friendship had started almost three decades prior. Netanyahu and Vladimir Putin during the Moscow Victory Day Parade on 9 May 2018 In October 2014, author Jeffrey Goldberg related a conversation in which Goldberg said a senior official of the Obama administration called Netanyahu a \\"chickenshit\\" after Netanyahu accused U.S. President Barack Obama of \\"acting contrary to American values\\". Goldberg went on to say that Netanyahu and his cabinet were largely to blame for the tensions between the Netanyahu and Obama governments.Jeffrey Goldberg, The Crisis In US‚ÄìIsrael Relations Is Officially Here. The Atlantic, 28 October 2014 Secretary of State John Kerry phoned Netanyahu to clarify that \\"such statements are disgraceful, unacceptable and damaging\\" and \\"do not reflect the position of the United States\\". Netanyahu responded by saying \\"I'm being attacked because of my determination to defend Israel's interests. The safety of Israel is not important to those who attack me anonymously and personally.\\" Because of evident rifts between Netanyahu and members of the Obama administration, observers have characterized the relationship as having reached a crisis level by October 2014. The relationship between Netanyahu and the Obama administration had become problematic enough that Jeffrey Goldberg reported in November 2014 that his conversations with Netanyahu and other Israeli officials indicated Israel would wait until a new U.S. president is elected before attempting to repair the relationship with the White House. According to Alon Pinkas, a former diplomat and adviser to Israeli prime ministers, \\"Netanyahu‚Äôs self-righteousness that this resolution is going to be changed or reversed by Trump is totally unfounded.\\" On 23 December 2016, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution calling for an end to Israeli settlements. In a departure from longstanding American policy, the U.S. abstained from the vote and did not exercise its veto power. At the behest of the Netanyahu government, President-elect Trump attempted to intercede by publicly advocating the resolution be vetoed and successfully persuading Egypt's Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to temporarily withdraw it from consideration. The resolution was then \\"proposed again by Malaysia, New Zealand, Senegal and Venezuela\\" ‚Äì and passed 14 to 0. Netanyahu's office alleged that \\"the Obama administration not only failed to protect Israel against this gang-up at the UN, it colluded with it behind the scenes\\", adding: \\"Israel looks forward to working with President-elect Trump and with all our friends in Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, to negate the harmful effects of this absurd resolution.\\" Netanyahu with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro in Jerusalem, 31 March 2019 In early 2018 the Polish parliament adopted a new Polish law criminalizing suggestions that Poles were collectively complicit in Holocaust-related or other war crimes that had been committed during World War II by the Axis powers.Israel and Poland try to tamp down tensions after Poland‚Äôs ‚Äòdeath camp‚Äô law sparks Israeli outrage, Washington Post, 28 January 2018Israel and Poland clash over proposed Holocaust law, Reuters, 28 January 2018 Later that year at the Munich Security Conference, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said \\"it is not going to be seen as criminal to say that there were Polish perpetrators, as there were Jewish perpetrators (...) not only German perpetrators\\" implicated in the Jewish Holocaust. Netanyahu called his Polish counterpart's comment \\"outrageous\\" for saying that Jews had been among the Holocaust's perpetrators.\\"Benjamin Netanyahu attacks Polish PM for saying Jews were among perpetrators of the Holocaust\\". The Independent. 18 February 2018. The resulting crisis in Israel‚ÄìPoland relations was resolved in late June that year when the two prime ministers issued a joint communiqu√© endorsing research into the Jewish Holocaust and condemning the misnomer \\"Polish concentration camps\\". According to Efraim Zuroff of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, during the visit of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in Jerusalem, Netanyahu failed to publicly address Ukraine's official policy of rehabilitating local Nazi collaborators like UPA leader Roman Shukhevych who had participated in the murder of Jews. Netanyahu has developed a close relationship with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro following Bolsonaro's election in 2018. Netanyahu and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan have tense relations. In March 2019, after being denounced by Turkey as a racist for saying that Israel was the nation-state of the Jewish people only, Netanyahu called Erdoƒüan a dictator and mocked him for imprisoning journalists in a tweet. In response, Erdoƒüan called Netanyahu as \\"the thief who heads Israel\\", referencing the ongoing corruption scandals against Netanyahu. In the same speech, Erdoƒüan further escalated the spat by addressing to Netanyahu directly, saying \\"you are a tyrant. You are a tyrant who slaughters 7-year-old Palestinian kids\\", and further in April 2018, calling Israel \\"terror state\\" and Netanyahu \\"terrorist\\".Erdogan Calls Netanyahu \\"terrorist\\", Israel \\"Terrorist State\\" Al- Jazeera Netanyahu tweeted that \\"Erdoƒüan is among Hamas's biggest supporters and there is no doubt that he well understands terrorism and slaughter.\\" Netanyahu condemned the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria and warned against ethnic cleansing of Kurds by Turkey and its proxies.

Symptoms include impairments in language and coordination and repetitive movements. Those affected often have slower growth, difficulty walking, and a smaller head size. Complications of Rett syndrome can include seizures, scoliosis, and sleeping problems. The severity of the condition is variable, however. Rett syndrome is due to a genetic mutation in the MECP2 gene, on the X chromosome. It almost always occurs as a new mutation, with less than one percent of cases being inherited from a person's parents. It occurs almost exclusively in girls; boys who have a similar mutation typically die shortly after birth. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms and can be confirmed with genetic testing. There is no known cure for Rett syndrome. Treatment is directed at improving symptoms. Anticonvulsants may be used to help with seizures. Special education, physiotherapy, and braces may also be useful. Many of those with the condition live into middle age. The condition affects about 1 in 8,500 females. It was first described by Austrian pediatrician Andreas Rett in 1966. As his writings were in German, they did not become widely known in the English-speaking world. Swedish pediatrician Bengt Hagberg published an English article in 1983 and named the condition after Rett. In 1999, Lebanese-American physician Huda Zoghbi discovered the mutation that causes the condition. Signs and symptoms Stage I Stage I, called early-onset, typically begins between 6 and 18 months of age. This stage is often overlooked because symptoms of the disorder may be somewhat vague, and parents and doctors may not notice the subtle slowing of development at first. The infant may begin to show less eye contact and have reduced interest in toys. There may be delays in gross motor skills such as sitting or crawling. Hand-wringing and decreasing head growth may occur, but not enough to draw attention. This stage usually lasts for a few months but can continue for more than a year. Stage II Stage II, or the rapid destructive stage, usually begins between ages 1 and 4 and may last for weeks or months. Its onset may be rapid or gradual as the child loses purposeful hand skills and spoken language. Characteristic hand movements such as wringing, washing, clapping, or tapping, as well as repeatedly moving the hands to the mouth often begin during this stage which is called mouthing. The child may hold the hands clasped behind the back or held at the sides, with random touching, grasping, and releasing. The movements continue while the child is awake but disappear during sleep. Breathing irregularities such as episodes of apnea and hyperventilation may occur, although breathing usually improves during sleep. Some girls also display autistic-like symptoms such as loss of social interaction and communication. Walking may be unsteady and initiating motor movements can be difficult. Slowed head growth is usually noticed during this stage. Stage III Stage III, or the plateau or pseudo-stationary stage, usually begins between ages 2 and 10 and can last for years. Apraxia, motor problems, and seizures are prominent during this stage. However, there may be improvement in behavior, with less irritability, crying, and autistic-like features. In stage III there may be more interest in the surroundings and alertness, attention span, and communication skills may improve. Many girls remain in this stage for most of their lives. Stage IV Stage IV, or the late motor deterioration stage, can last for years or decades. Prominent features include reduced mobility, curvature of the spine, and muscle weakness, rigidity, spasticity, and increased muscle tone with abnormal posturing of an arm, leg. Girls who were previously able to walk may stop walking. Cognition, communication, or hand skills generally do not decline in stage IV. Repetitive hand movements may decrease and eye gaze usually improves. thumb Variants thumb The signs and symptoms of the typical form of the Rett syndrome are well described. In addition to the classical form of Rett syndrome, several atypical forms have been described over the years; the main groups are: * Congenital variant (Rolando variant): in this severe subtype of Rett syndrome, the development of the patients and their head circumference are abnormal from birth. The typical gaze of Rett syndrome patients is usually absent; * Zappella variant of Rett Syndrome or preserved speech variant: in this subtype of Rett syndrome the patients acquire some manual skills and language is partially recovered around the age of 5 years (that is after the regression phase). Height, weight and head circumference are often in the normal range, and a good gross motor function can be observed. The Zappella variant is a milder form of Rett syndrome; * Hanefeld variant or early epilepsy variant. In this form of Rett syndrome, the patients suffer from epilepsy before 5 months of age. The definition itself of the Rett syndrome has been refined over the years: as the atypical forms subsist near to the classical form (Hagberg & Gillberg, 1993), the \\"Rett Complex\\" terminology has been introduced. Cause The location of the gene responsible for Rett syndrome Genetically, Rett syndrome (RTT) is caused by mutations in the gene MECP2 located on the X chromosome (which is involved in transcriptional silencing and epigenetic regulation of methylated DNA), and can arise sporadically or from germline mutations. In less than 10% of RTT cases, mutations in the genes CDKL5 or FOXG1 have also been found to resemble it. Rett syndrome is initially diagnosed by clinical observation, but the diagnosis is definitive when there is a genetic defect in the MECP2 gene. In some very rare cases, no known mutated gene can be found; possibly due to changes in MECP2 that are not identified by presently used techniques or mutations in other genes that may result in clinical similarities. It has been argued that Rett syndrome is in fact a neurodevelopmental condition as opposed to a neurodegenerative condition. One piece of evidence for this is that mice with induced Rett Syndrome show no neuronal death, and some studies have suggested that their phenotypes can be partially rescued by adding functional MECP2 gene back when they are adults. This information has also helped lead to further studies aiming to treat the disorder. Sporadic mutations In at least 95% of Rett syndrome cases, the cause is a de novo mutation in the child. That is, it is not inherited from either parent. Parents are generally genotypically normal, without a MECP2 mutation. In cases of the sporadic form of RTT, the mutated MECP2 is thought to derive almost exclusively from a de novo mutation on the male copy of the X chromosome. It is not yet known what causes the sperm to mutate, and such mutations are rare. Germline mutations It can also be inherited from phenotypically normal mothers who have a germline mutation in the gene encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein-2, MeCP2. In these cases, inheritance follows an X-linked dominant pattern and is seen almost exclusively in females, as most males die in utero or shortly after birth. MECP2 is found near the end of the long arm of the X chromosome at Xq28. An atypical form of RTT, characterized by infantile spasms or early onset epilepsy, can also be caused by a mutation to the gene encoding cyclin- dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5). Rett syndrome affects one in every 12,500 female live births by age 12 years. Mechanism Pontine noradrenergic deficits Brain levels of norepinephrine are lower in people with Rett syndrome (reviewed in). The genetic loss of MECP2 changes the properties of cells in the locus coeruleus, the exclusive source of noradrenergic innervation to the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. These changes include hyperexcitability and decreased functioning of its noradrenergic innervation. Moreover, a reduction of the tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) mRNA level, the rate- limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis, was detected in the whole pons of MECP2-null male as well as in adult heterozygous (MECP2+/-) female mice. Using immunoquantitative techniques, a decrease of Th protein staining level, number of locus coeruleus TH-expressing neurons and density of dendritic arborization surrounding the structure was shown in symptomatic MeCP2-deficient mice. However, locus coeruleus cells are not dying, but are more likely losing their fully mature phenotype, since no apoptotic neurons in the pons were detected. Researchers have concluded that \\"Because these neurons are a pivotal source of norepinephrine throughout the brainstem and forebrain and are involved in the regulation of diverse functions disrupted in Rett syndrome, such as respiration and cognition, we hypothesize that the locus coeruleus is a critical site at which loss of MECP2 results in CNS dysfunction.\\" The restoration of normal locus coeruleus function may therefore be of potential therapeutic value in the treatment of Rett syndrome. Midbrain dopaminergic disturbances The majority of dopamine in the mammalian brain is synthesized by nuclei located in the mesencephalon. The substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the retrorubral field (RRF) contains dopaminergic neurons expressing tyrosine hydroxylase (Th, i.e. the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis). The nigro-striatal pathway originates from SNpc and irradiate its principal rostral target, the Caudate- Putamen (CPu) through the median forebrain bundle (MFB). This connection is involved in the tight modulation of motor strategies computed by a cortico- basal ganglia- thalamo-cortical loop. Indeed, based on the canonical anatomofunctional model of basal ganglia, nigrostriatal dopamine is able to modulate the motor loop by acting on dopaminergic receptors located on striatal GABAergic medium spiny neurons. Dysregulation of the nigrostriatal pathway is causative from Parkinson disease (PD) in humans. Toxic and/or genetic ablation of SNpc neurons produces experimental parkinsonism in mice and primates. The common features of PD and PD animal models are motor impairments (hypotonia, bradykinesia, hypokinesia). RTT pathology, in some aspects, overlaps the motor phenotype observed in PD patients. Several neuropathological studies on postmortem brain samples argued for an SNpc alteration evidenced by neuromelanin hypopigmentation, reduction in the structure area, and even controversial, signs of apoptosis. In parallel, an hypometabolism was underlined by a reduction of several catecholamines (dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline) and their principal metabolic by- products. Mouse models of RTT are available and the most studied are constitutively deleted Mecp2 mice developed by Adrian Bird or Rudolf Jaenisch laboratories. In accordance with the motor spectrum of the RTT phenotype, Mecp2-null mice show motor abnormalities from postnatal day 30 that worsen until death. These models offer a crucial substrate to elucidate the molecular and neuroanatomical correlates of an MeCP2-deficiency. Recently (2008), it was shown that the conditional deletion of Mecp2 in catecholaminergic neurons (by crossing of Th-Cre mice with loxP-flanked Mecp2 ones) recapitulates a motor symptomatology, it was further documented that brain levels of Th in mice lacking MeCP2 in catecholaminergic neurons only are reduced, participating to the motor phenotype. However, the most studied model for the evaluation of therapeutics is the Mecp2-null mouse (totally devoid of MeCP2). In this context, a reduction in the number and soma size of Th-expressing neurons is present from 5 weeks of age and is accompanied by a decrease of Th immunoreactivity in the caudate-putamen, the principal target of dopaminergic neurons arising from the SNpc. Moreover, a neurochemical analysis of dopaminergic contents in microdissected midbrain and striatal areas revealed a reduction of dopamine at five and nine weeks of age. It is noteworthy that later on (at nine weeks), the morphological parameters remain altered but not worsen, whereas the phenotype progresses and behavioral deficits are more severe. The amount of fully activated Th (Serine40-phosphorylated isoform) in neurons that remain in the SNpc is mildly affected at 5 weeks but severely impaired by 9 weeks. Finally, using a chronic and oral L-Dopa treatment on MeCP2-deficient mice authors reported an amelioration of some of the motor deficits previously identified. Altogether, these results argue for an alteration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway in MeCP2-deficient animals as a contributor of the neuromotor deficits. There is an association of the disease with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Interactive pathway map An interactive pathway map of Rett syndrome has been published. Diagnosis Prior to the discovery of a genetic cause, Rett syndrome had been designated as a pervasive developmental disorder by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), together with the autism spectrum disorders. Some argued against this conclusive assignment because RTT resembles non-autistic disorders such as fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, or Down syndrome that also exhibit autistic features. After research proved the molecular mechanism, in 2013 the DSM-5 removed the syndrome altogether from classification as a mental disorder. Rett syndrome diagnosis involves close observation of the child's growth and development to observe any abnormalities in regards to developmental milestones. A diagnosis is considered when decreased head growth is observed. Conditions with similar symptoms must first be ruled out. There is a certain criteria that must be met for the diagnosis. A blood test can rule in or rule out the presence of the MECP2 mutation, however, this mutation is present in other conditions as well. For a classic diagnosis, all four criteria for ruling in a diagnosis must be met, as well as the two criteria for ruling out a diagnosis. Supportive criteria may also be present, but are not required for diagnosis. For an atypical or variant diagnosis, at least two of the four criteria for ruling in the diagnosis must be met, as well as five of the eleven supportive criteria. A period of symptom regression followed by recovery or symptom stabilization must also occur. Children are often misdiagnosed as having autism, cerebral palsy, or another form of developmental delay. A positive test for the MECP2 mutation is not enough to make a diagnosis. Ruling in * Decreased or loss of use of fine motor skills * Decreased or loss of verbal speech * Abnormalities during gait * Repetitive hand movements such as wringing/squeezing or clapping/tapping Ruling out * Traumatic brain injury, neurometabolic disease, or severe infection that may better explain symptoms * Abnormal psychomotor development during the first six months of life Supportive criteria * Breathing disturbances when awake * Bruxism while awake * Impaired sleep pattern * Abnormal muscle tone * Peripheral vasomotor disturbances * Scoliosis/kyphosis * Growth retardation * Small cold hands and feet * Inappropriate laughing/screaming spells * Diminished response to pain * Intense eye communication (eye pointing) Differential diagnosis Signs of Rett syndrome that are similar to autism: Signs of Rett syndrome that are also present in cerebral palsy (regression of the type seen in Rett syndrome would be unusual in cerebral palsy; this confusion could rarely be made): Treatment Currently there is no cure for Rett syndrome. Treatment is directed towards improving function and addressing symptoms. A multi- disciplinary team approach is typically used to treat the person throughout life. This team may include primary care physician, physical therapist, occupational therapist, speech-language pathologist, nutritionist, and support services in academic and occupational settings. Some children may require special equipment and aids such as braces to arrest scoliosis, splints to modify hand movements, and nutritional programs to help them maintain adequate weight. Treatment of Rett syndrome includes: Because of the increased risk of sudden cardiac death, when long QT syndrome is found on an annual screening EKG it is treated with an anti-arrhythmic such as a beta-blocker. There is some evidence that phenytoin may be more effective than a beta-blocker. Prognosis Males with pathogenic MECP2 mutations usually die within the first 2 years from severe encephalopathy, unless they have one or more extra X chromosomes, or have somatic mosaicism. Male fetuses with the disorder rarely survive to term. Because the disease-causing gene is located on the X chromosome, a female born with an MECP2 mutation on her X chromosome has another X chromosome with an ostensibly normal copy of the same gene, while a male with the mutation on his X chromosome has no other X chromosome, only a Y chromosome; thus, he has no normal gene. Without a normal gene to provide normal proteins in addition to the abnormal proteins caused by a MECP2 mutation, the XY karyotype male fetus is unable to slow the development of the disease, hence the failure of many male fetuses with a MECP2 mutation to survive to term. Females with a MECP2 mutation, however, have a non-mutant chromosome that provides them enough normal protein to survive longer. Research shows that males with Rett syndrome may result from Klinefelter's syndrome, in which the male has an XXY karyotype. Thus, a non-mutant MECP2 gene is necessary for a Rett's-affected embryo to survive in most cases, and the embryo, male or female, must have another X chromosome. There have, however, been several cases of 46,XY karyotype males with a MECP2 mutation (associated with classical Rett syndrome in females) carried to term, who were affected by neonatal encephalopathy and died before 2 years of age. The incidence of Rett syndrome in males is unknown, partly owing to the low survival of male fetuses with the Rett syndrome-associated MECP2 mutations, and partly to differences between signs caused by MECP2 mutations and those caused by Rett's. Females can live up to 40 years or more. Laboratory studies on Rett syndrome may show abnormalities such as: * EEG abnormalities from 2 years of age * atypical brain glycolipids * elevated CSF levels of beta- endorphin and glutamate * reduction of substance P * decreased levels of CSF nerve growth factors A high proportion of deaths are abrupt, but most have no identifiable cause; in some instances death is the result most likely of: * spontaneous brainstem dysfunction * cardiac arrest, likely due to long QT syndrome, ventricular tachycardia or other arrhythmias * seizures *gastric perforation History Andreas Rett, a pediatrician in Vienna, first described the condition in 1966. As his writings were in German, they did not become widely known in the English-speaking world. Bengt Hagberg, a Swedish pediatrician, published an English article in 1983 and named the condition after Rett. In 1999, Lebanese-American physician Huda Zoghbi discovered the mutation that causes the condition. Research Gene therapy is under study in animal models to achieve regulated expression of a normal MECP2 gene.

It is the opposite of south and is perpendicular to east and west. North is a noun, adjective, or adverb indicating direction or geography. Etymology The word north is related to the Old High German nord, both descending from the Proto-Indo-European unit *ner-, meaning \\"left; below\\" as north is to left when facing the rising sun. Similarly, the other cardinal directions are also related to the sun's position. The Latin word borealis comes from the Greek boreas \\"north wind, north\\", which, according to Ovid, was personified as the son of the river-god Strymon, the father of Calais and Zetes. Septentrionalis is from septentriones, \\"the seven plow oxen\\", a name of Ursa Maior. The Greek ·ºÄœÅŒ∫œÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ (arktik√≥s) is named for the same constellation, and is the source of the English word Arctic. Other languages have other derivations. For example, in Lezgian, kefer can mean both \\"disbelief\\" and \\"north\\", since to the north of the Muslim Lezgian homeland there are areas formerly inhabited by non-Muslim Caucasian and Turkic peoples. In many languages of Mesoamerica, north also means \\"up\\". In Hungarian, the word for north is √©szak, which is derived from √©jszaka (\\"night\\"), since above the Tropic of Cancer, the Sun never shines from the north, except inside the Arctic Circle during the summer midnight sun. The direction north is quite often associated with colder climates because most of the world's land at high latitudes is located in the Northern Hemisphere. The Arctic Circle passes through the Arctic Ocean, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, the United States (Alaska), Canada (Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut), Denmark (Greenland) and Iceland (where it passes through the small offshore island of Gr√≠msey). Mapping By convention, the top side of a map is often north. To go north using a compass for navigation, set a bearing or azimuth of 0¬∞ or 360¬∞. North is specifically the direction that, in Western culture, is considered the fundamental direction: * North is used (explicitly or implicitly) to define all other directions. * The (visual) top edges of maps usually correspond to the northern edge of the area represented, unless explicitly stated otherwise or landmarks are considered more useful for that territory than specific directions. * On any rotating astronomical object, north often denotes the side appearing to rotate counter-clockwise when viewed from afar along the axis of rotation. However, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) defines the geographic north pole of a planet or any of its satellites in the Solar System as the planetary pole that is in the same celestial hemisphere, relative to the invariable plane of the Solar System, as Earth's north pole. This means some objects, such as Uranus, rotate in the retrograde direction: when seen from the IAU north, the spin is clockwise. Magnetic north and declination Magnetic north is of interest because it is the direction indicated as north on a properly functioning (but uncorrected) magnetic compass. The difference between it and true north is called the magnetic declination (or simply the declination where the context is clear). For many purposes and physical circumstances, the error in direction that results from ignoring the distinction is tolerable; in others a mental or instrument compensation, based on assumed knowledge of the applicable declination, can solve all the problems. But simple generalizations on the subject should be treated as unsound, and as likely to reflect popular misconceptions about terrestrial magnetism. Maps intended for usage in orienteering by compass will clearly indicate the local declination for easy correction to true north. Maps may also indicate grid north, which is a navigational term referring to the direction northwards along the grid lines of a map projection. Roles of north as prime direction The visible rotation of the night sky around the visible celestial pole provides a vivid metaphor of that direction corresponding to \\"up\\". Thus the choice of the north as corresponding to \\"up\\" in the northern hemisphere, or of south in that role in the southern, is, prior to worldwide communication, anything but an arbitrary one - at least for night-time astronomers. Compare: (Note: the southern hemisphere lacks a prominent visible analog to the northern Pole Star.) On the contrary, Chinese and Islamic cultures considered south as the proper \\"top\\" end for maps. In the cultures of Polynesia, where navigation played an important role, winds - prevailing local or ancestral - can define cardinal points. In Western culture: * Maps tend to be drawn for viewing with either true north or magnetic north at the top. * Globes of the earth have the North Pole at the top, or if the Earth's axis is represented as inclined from vertical (normally by the angle it has relative to the axis of the Earth's orbit), in the top half. * Maps are usually labelled to indicate which direction on the map corresponds to a direction on the earth,  usually with a single arrow oriented to the map's representation of true north,  occasionally with a single arrow oriented to the map's representation of magnetic north, or two arrows oriented to true and magnetic north respectively,  occasionally with a compass rose, but if so, usually on a map with north at the top and usually with north decorated more prominently than any other compass point. * \\"Up\\" is a metaphor for north. The notion that north should always be \\"up\\" and east at the right was established by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy. The historian Daniel Boorstin suggests that perhaps this was because the better-known places in his world were in the northern hemisphere, and on a flat map these were most convenient for study if they were in the upper right-hand corner. Roles of east and west as inherently subsidiary directions While the choice of north over south as prime direction reflects quite arbitrary historical factors, east and west are not nearly as natural alternatives as first glance might suggest. Their folk definitions are, respectively, \\"where the sun rises\\" and \\"where it sets\\". Except on the Equator, however, these definitions, taken together, would imply that * east and west would not be 180 degrees apart, but instead would differ from that by up to twice the degrees of latitude of the location in question, and * they would each move slightly from day to day and, in the temperate zones, markedly over the course of the year. Reasonably accurate folk astronomy, such as is usually attributed to Stone Age peoples or later Celts, would arrive at east and west by noting the directions of rising and setting (preferably more than once each) and choosing as prime direction one of the two mutually opposite directions that lie halfway between those two. The true folk-astronomical definitions of east and west are \\"the directions, a right angle from the prime direction, that are closest to the rising and setting, respectively, of the sun (or moon). Cultural references Being the \\"default\\" direction on the compass, north is referred to frequently in Western popular culture. Some examples include: * The phrase \\"north of X\\" is often used by Americans to mean \\"more than X\\" or \\"greater than X\\", i.e. \\"The world population is north of 7 billion people\\" or \\"north of 40 [years old]\\".

In this dialogue, Socrates and Theaetetus discuss three definitions of knowledge: knowledge as nothing but perception, knowledge as true judgment, and, finally, knowledge as a true judgment with an account. Each of these definitions is shown to be unsatisfactory. Socrates declares Theaetetus will have benefited from discovering what he does not know, and that he may be better able to approach the topic in the future. The conversation ends with Socrates' announcement that he has to go to court to face a criminal indictment. The framing of the dialogue The dialogue is framed by a brief scene in which Euclid of Megara tells his friend Terpsion that he has a written record of a dialogue between Socrates and Theaetetus, which occurred when Theaetetus was quite a young man. This dialogue is then read aloud to the two men by a slave owned by Euclid. Midwife to knowledge Socrates asks Theodorus if he knows of any geometry students who show particular promise. Theodorus assures him that he does, but that he does not want to over-praise the boy, lest anyone suspect he is in love with him. He says that the boy, Theaetetus, is a young Socrates look-alike, rather homely, with a snub-nose and protruding eyes. The two older men spot Theaetetus rubbing himself down with oil, and Theodorus reviews the facts about him, that he is intelligent, virile, and an orphan whose inheritance has been squandered by trustees. Socrates tells Theaetetus that he cannot make out what knowledge is, and is looking for a simple formula for it. Theaetetus says he really has no idea how to answer the question, and Socrates tells him that he is there to help. Socrates says he has modelled his career after his midwife mother. She delivered babies and for his part, Socrates can tell when a young man is in the throes of trying to give birth to a thought. Socrates considers his philosophical work as midwifery (Maieutics). This method, later also called Socratic method, consists in eliciting knowledge by a series of questions and answers. Philosophical labor Socrates thinks that the idea that knowledge is perception must be identical in meaning, if not in actual words, to Protagoras' famous maxim \\"Man is the measure of all things.\\" Socrates wrestles to conflate the two ideas, and stirs in for good measure a claim about Homer being the captain of a team of Heraclitan flux theorists. Socrates dictates a complete textbook of logical fallacies to the bewildered Theaetetus. When Socrates tells the child that he (Socrates) will later be smaller without losing an inch because Theaetetus will have grown relative to him, the child complains of dizziness (155c). In an often quoted line, Socrates says with delight that \\"wonder (thaumazein) belongs to the philosopher\\". He admonishes the boy to be patient and bear with his questions, so that his hidden beliefs may be yanked out into the bright light of day. Examining the offspring When Socrates sums up what they have agreed on so far, it becomes problematic that knowledge is sense perception, for Socrates raises the question that \\"When the same wind blows, one of us feels cold and the other not?\\" As a result, he introduces the idea of Heraclitean flux to act as a defense to the wind objection. Heracliteanism shows that \\"Nothing is in itself just one thing...Everything is in a process of coming to be\\". Thus as there is no fixed meaning in things, but they draw their meaning in a referential difference to other things, the wind objection can be incorporated into Theaetetus's claim that \\"Knowledge is sense perception\\". As a result, they can then continue their inquiry as to the truth of this claim. It is important to note that the Heraclitean doctrine of Flux is not the same as the Protagorean doctrine. The Protagorean is radical truth relativism whereas the Heraclitean is radical reality relativism. It serves as a supporting theory to the Protagorean interpretation of Theaetetus's claim, in order that they might fully inquire as to the validity of this premise. Socrates admits that it is unfortunate that Protagoras is dead and cannot defend his idea against people such as himself. He says that the two of them are \\"trampling on his orphan\\" (164e) but the charge remains. Abusing the \\"orphan\\" of Protagoras Since Protagoras is dead, Socrates puts himself in the sophist's shoes and tries to do him the favor of defending his idea (166a-168c). Socrates concedes that if Protagoras were still alive, he would have more to say in his own defense, and that they are now essentially mistreating \\"his orphan child.\\" Putting words in the dead sophist's mouth, Socrates declares that Protagoras asserts with his maxim that all things are in motion and whatever seems to be the case, is the case for the perceiver, whether the individual or the state. At the end of his speech, Socrates admits to Theodorus that Protagoras would have done a far better job of defending his own ideas. Theodorus tells Socrates that he must be kidding, that he has come to the task with boyish vigor. Theodorus does not claim to be a disciple of Protagoras, but states that he was a friend. Socrates invites Theodorus to put up a more vigorous defense of Protagoras, as he does not want it suggested that he has used the child's timidity (of Theaetetus) to aid him in his argument against the doctrine of Protagoras (168d). Socrates, not at all certain that he has not misrepresented Protagoras in making each man the measure of his own wisdom, presses Theodorus on the question of whether any follower of Protagoras (himself included) would contend that nobody thinks anyone else is wrong (170c). Theodorus proves to be helpless against Socrates' arguments. He agrees that Protagoras concedes that those who disagree with him are correct (171a). In making Protagoras a complete epistemological relativist, where every person's individual perceptions are his reality and his truth, both Socrates and Theodorus paint Protagoras as maintaining an absurd position. The absent-minded philosopher Socrates then proceeds to explain why philosophers seem clumsy and stupid to the common lot of humanity. Socrates explains that philosophers are open to mockery because they are not concerned about what interests most people: they could not care less about the scandals in their neighbor's house, the tracing of one's ancestry to Heracles, and so on. In contrast, the philosopher is concerned with things that are, such as beauty and knowledge, which are \\"truly higher up\\". It is here that Socrates draws the classic portrait of the absent-minded intellectual who cannot make his bed or cook a meal (175e). Socrates adds a big bifurcation to this speech, saying that there are only two kinds of lives to be lived: a divinely happy one, lived by righteous philosophers or a godless, miserable one, such as most people live (176-177). Socrates admits this was a digression that threatens to drown his original project, which was to define knowledge. Theodorus, the old geometer, tells Socrates that he finds this sort of thing easier to follow than his earlier arguments. The men of flux Socrates says that the men of flux, like Homer and Heraclitus, are really hard to talk to because you can't pin them down. When you ask them a question, he says, they pluck from their quiver a little aphorism to let fly at you, and as you try to figure that one out, they wing another one at you. They leave nothing settled either in discourse, or in their own minds. Socrates adds that the opposite school of thought, that teaches of the \\"immovable whole\\" is just as hard to talk to (181a,b). Socrates says he met the father of the idea, Parmenides, when he was quite young, but does not want to get into another digression over it. Comparison of the mind to an aviary Socrates compares the human mind to an aviary. Socrates draws the distinction between having and possessing; the former typically implies the latter, though on the other hand, one can possess something, such as a bird, without actually having it (with them at any moment)(199a). Socrates says that as a man goes hunting about in his mind for knowledge of something, he might grab hold of the wrong thing. He says that mistaking eleven for twelve is like going in for a pigeon and coming up with a dove (199b). Theaetetus joins in the game, and says that to complete the picture, you need to envision pieces of ignorance flying around in there with the birds. But if this is the case, how would you be able to distinguish between the birds representing real knowledge and the ones representing false ones? Are there other birds that represent this type of knowledge? Socrates comes to the conclusion that this is absurd and therefore he discards the aviary analogy. Socrates and the Jury After discarding the bird-cage analogy, Socrates and Theaetetus return to the definition of knowledge as 'true judgement' (200e). This, Theaetetus argues, is true because it is 'free from mistakes' (200e). However Socrates introduces an example of a jury in the law-courts, being persuaded of an opinion by a lawyer. This persuasion is not the same as knowing the truth, as all is produced is 'conviction' in judging whatever the lawyers want (201a). Although Theaetetus hopes it is possible the lawyer will be able to 'persuade' the jury of the truth (201b), Socrates is unsatisfied as if they are justly persuaded, they will have true knowledge. However, in Socrates' belief, they cannot make a correct judgement as they would not have true knowledge (201c). With this conflict, Socrates decides that true judgement and knowledge must be different things. Knowledge as judgment with an account After distinguishing between knowledge and true judgement, Theaetetus recalls being told that true judgement 'with an account (logos) equates to knowledge (201d). Things without an account are 'unknowable', while things with an account are 'knowable'. Socrates responds by telling of a dream, in which he overheard people talking of primary elements (201e). These primary elements can only be named, they cannot be thought of as existing or not - he gives examples of words like 'itself, or that, each, alone or this' (202a). While they can be added to other words, they by themselves are just a name. When these elements are added together, Socrates says that a 'complex' is formed (202b). The primary elements are 'unaccountable and unknowable, but perceivable' while the complexes are 'knowable and expressible' and so can be objects of 'true judgement' (202b). He concludes his dream by agreeing with Theaetetus that knowledge is 'true judgement with an account' (202c). However, Socrates exposes some difficulties by examining letters. He takes the first two letters of his name, S and O to wonder if the syllable 'So' is knowable while the individual letters are not (203b-d). Theaetetus finds the idea strange, so Socrates deduces that in order to know the syllable, the letters must be known first (203e). Socrates proposes that the syllable can be a 'single form' produced from the letters. With this in mind, Socrates considers whether the 'sum' and the 'whole' are the same (204a). Theaetetus initially says they are not, but changes his mind in confusion when Socrates leads him through maths and the different ways of expressing the number six (204c-205b). After agreeing this, Socrates returns to the subject of syllables and letters to conclude from Theaetetus' answers that syllables are different from letters and cannot contain letters (205b). Theaetetus admits this idea is ridiculous (205c). Socrates returns to talking about elements and complexes to propose that they are in the same class, as they have 'no parts and [are] a single form' (205d). Socrates sums up this reversal by remarking that if anyone tries to tell them the complex is knowable and expressable while the element is the opposite, 'we had better not listen to him' (205e). He cites the example of a musician distinguishing individual notes (conceded to be elements of music) to propose that elements are 'much more clearly known'(206b). Socrates proposes an account to be 'making one's thought apparent vocally by means of words and verbal expressions' (206d). However, he wonders if that is so, everyone will be able to make judgement 'with an account' as they can all (except for the deaf and dumb) vocalize and express opinions on matters (206e). Socrates examines it further by suggesting that a man who can vocalize his judgement must be able to make reference to the primary elements of the subject (207a). Giving an example of defining a wagon by its individual parts (207a), agreement is reached that an account is 'going through a thing element by element'(207d). Socrates questions Theaetetus by drawing on his learning of how to write, and the idea that if you misplace individual elements (letters) of a name, that does not mean you have knowledge of it (208a). This finishes Socrates' second definition of an account as 'the way to the whole through the elements' (208c). The third definition Socrates offers is 'being able to tell some mark by which the object you are asked about differs from all other things' (208c), giving the example that the Sun is distinct for its brightness. However, this definition of an account fails as by getting to know the differentness of an object, you have to acquire knowledge about it. Thus the answer to the initial question 'What is knowledge' would be heavily circuitous - correct judgement accompanied by 'knowledge' of the differentness, which Socrates admits is 'silly' (210a). Conclusion Socrates concludes the dialogue by announcing that all the two have produced are mere \\"wind-eggs\\" and that he must be getting on now to the courthouse to face his trial being brought against him by Meletus.  Significant references in the dialogue  In this dialogue, Socrates refers to Epicharmus of Kos as \\"the prince of Comedy\\" and Homer as \\"the prince of Tragedy\\", and both as \\"great masters of either kind of poetry\\". This is significant because it is one of the very few extant references in greater antiquity (Fourth century BCE) to Epicharmus and his work. Another reference is in Plato's Gorgias dialogue.

Rarely, the disease is tick- borne. The incubation period is 9‚Äì40 days. Humans are vulnerable to Q fever, and infection can result from even a few organisms. The bacterium is an obligate intracellular pathogenic parasite.  Signs and symptoms  Incubation period is usually two to three weeks. The most common manifestation is flu-like symptoms with abrupt onset of fever, malaise, profuse perspiration, severe headache, muscle pain, joint pain, loss of appetite, upper respiratory problems, dry cough, pleuritic pain, chills, confusion, and gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. About half of infected individuals exhibit no symptoms. During its course, the disease can progress to an atypical pneumonia, which can result in a life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome, whereby such symptoms usually occur during the first four to five days of infection. Less often, Q fever causes (granulomatous) hepatitis, which may be asymptomatic or becomes symptomatic with malaise, fever, liver enlargement, and pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Whereas transaminase values are often elevated, jaundice is uncommon. Retinal vasculitis is a rare manifestation of Q fever. The chronic form of Q fever is virtually identical to endocarditis (i.e. inflammation of the inner lining of the heart), which can occur months or decades following the infection. It is usually fatal if untreated. However, with appropriate treatment, the mortality falls to around 10%.  Diagnosis  Q fever management algorithm from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Diagnosis is usually based on serology (looking for an antibody response) rather than looking for the organism itself. Serology allows the detection of chronic infection by the appearance of high levels of the antibody against the virulent form of the bacterium. Molecular detection of bacterial DNA is increasingly used. Culture is technically difficult and not routinely available in most microbiology laboratories. Q fever can cause endocarditis (infection of the heart valves) which may require transoesophageal echocardiography to diagnose. Q fever hepatitis manifests as an elevation of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase, but a definitive diagnosis is only possible on liver biopsy, which shows the characteristic fibrin ring granulomas.  Prevention  Protection is offered by Q-Vax, a whole-cell, inactivated vaccine developed by an Australian vaccine manufacturing company, CSL Limited. The intradermal vaccination is composed of killed C. burnetii organisms. Skin and blood tests should be done before vaccination to identify pre-existing immunity, because vaccinating people who already have an immunity can result in a severe local reaction. After a single dose of vaccine, protective immunity lasts for many years. Revaccination is not generally required. Annual screening is typically recommended. In 2001, Australia introduced a national Q fever vaccination program for people working in ‚Äúat risk‚Äù occupations. Vaccinated or previously exposed people may have their status recorded on the Australian Q Fever Register, which may be a condition of employment in the meat processing industry or in veterinary research. An earlier killed vaccine had been developed in the Soviet Union, but its side effects prevented its licensing abroad. Preliminary results suggest vaccination of animals may be a method of control. Published trials proved that use of a registered phase vaccine (Coxevac) on infected farms is a tool of major interest to manage or prevent early or late abortion, repeat breeding, anoestrus, silent oestrus, metritis, and decreases in milk yield when C. burnetii is the major cause of these problems.  Treatment  Treatment of acute Q fever with antibiotics is very effective and should be given in consultation with an infectious diseases specialist. Commonly used antibiotics include doxycycline, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and hydroxychloroquine. Chronic Q fever is more difficult to treat and can require up to four years of treatment with doxycycline and quinolones or doxycycline with hydroxychloroquine.Q fever in pregnancy is especially difficult to treat because doxycycline and ciprofloxacin are contraindicated in pregnancy. The preferred treatment is five weeks of co-trimoxazole. Epidemiology C. burnetii, the Q fever-causing agent The pathogenic agent is found worldwide, with the exception of New Zealand. The bacterium is extremely sustainable and virulent: a single organism is able to cause an infection. The common source of infection is inhalation of contaminated dust, contact with contaminated milk, meat, or wool, and particularly birthing products. Ticks can transfer the pathogenic agent to other animals. Transfer between humans seems extremely rare and has so far been described in very few cases. Some studies have shown more men to be affected than women, which may be attributed to different employment rates in typical professions. ‚ÄúAt risk‚Äù occupations include: * Veterinary personnel * Stockyard workers * Farmers * Sheep shearers * Animal transporters * Laboratory workers handling potentially infected veterinary samples or visiting abattoirs * People who cull and process kangaroos * Hide (tannery) workers  History  Image A: A normal chest X-ray Image B: Q fever pneumonia Q fever was first described in 1935 by Edward Holbrook Derrick in slaughterhouse workers in Brisbane, Queensland. The \\"Q\\" stands for \\"query\\" and was applied at a time when the causative agent was unknown; it was chosen over suggestions of abattoir fever and Queensland rickettsial fever, to avoid directing negative connotations at either the cattle industry or the state of Queensland. The pathogen of Q fever was discovered in 1937, when Frank Macfarlane Burnet and Mavis Freeman isolated the bacterium from one of Derrick's patients. It was originally identified as a species of Rickettsia. H.R. Cox and Gordon Davis elucidated the transmission when they isolated it from ticks found in the US state of Montana in 1938. It is a zoonotic disease whose most common animal reservoirs are cattle, sheep, and goats. Coxiella burnetii ‚Äì named for Cox and Burnet ‚Äì is no longer regarded as closely related to the Rickettsiae, but as similar to Legionella and Francisella, and is a proteobacterium.  Society and culture  An early mention of Q fever was important in one of the early Dr. Kildare films (1939, Calling Dr. Kildare). Kildare's mentor Dr. Gillespie (Lionel Barrymore) tires of his prot√©g√© working fruitlessly on \\"exotic diagnoses\\" (\\"I think it's Q fever!\\") and sends him to work in a neighborhood clinic, instead. Q fever was also highlighted in an episode of the U.S. television medical drama House (\\"The Dig\\", season seven, episode 18).  Biological warfare  C burnetii has been developed as a biological weapon. The United States investigated it as a potential biological warfare agent in the 1950s, with eventual standardization as agent OU. At Fort Detrick and Dugway Proving Ground, human trials were conducted on Whitecoat volunteers to determine the median infective dose (18 MICLD50/person i.h.) and course of infection. The Deseret Test Center dispensed biological Agent OU with ships and aircraft, during Project 112 and Project SHAD.Deseret Test Center, Project SHAD, Shady Grove revised fact sheet As a standardized biological, it was manufactured in large quantities at Pine Bluff Arsenal, with 5,098 gallons in the arsenal in bulk at the time of demilitarization in 1970. C. burnetii is currently ranked as a \\"category B\\" bioterrorism agent by the CDC. It can be contagious, and is very stable in aerosols in a wide range of temperatures. Q fever microorganisms may survive on surfaces up to 60 days. It is considered a good agent in part because its ID50 (number of bacilli needed to infect 50% of individuals) is considered to be one, making it the lowest known. Other animals Cattle, goats, and sheep are most commonly infected, and can serve as a reservoir for the bacteria. Q fever is a well-recognized cause of abortions in Ruminants and pets. C. burnetii infection in dairy cattle has been well documented and its association with reproductive problems in these animals has been reported in Canada, the US, Cyprus, France, Hungary, Japan, Switzerland, and Germany. For instance, in a study published in 2008, a significant association has been shown between the seropositivity of herds and the appearance of typical clinical signs of Q fever, such as abortion, stillbirth, weak calves, and repeat breeding. Moreover, experimental inoculation of C. burnetii in cattle induced not only respiratory disorders and cardiac failures (myocarditis), but also frequent abortions and irregular repeat breedings.

The most common form is infantile Tay‚ÄìSachs disease which becomes apparent around three to six months of age, with the baby losing the ability to turn over, sit, or crawl. This is then followed by seizures, hearing loss, and inability to move, with death usually occurring by the age of four. Less commonly, the disease may occur in later childhood or adulthood (juvenile or late-onset). These forms tend to be less severe, but the juvenile form typically results in death by age 15. Tay‚ÄìSachs disease is caused by a genetic mutation in the HEXA gene on chromosome 15, which codes for a subunit of the hexosaminidase enzyme known as hexosaminidase A. It is inherited from a person's parents in an autosomal recessive manner. The mutation disrupts the activity of the enzyme, which results in the buildup of the molecule GM2 ganglioside within cells, leading to toxicity. Diagnosis may be supported by measuring the blood hexosaminidase A level or genetic testing. Tay‚ÄìSachs disease is a type of GM2 gangliosidosis and sphingolipidosis. The treatment of Tay‚ÄìSachs disease is supportive in nature. This may involve multiple specialities as well as psychosocial support for the family. The disease is rare in the general population. In Ashkenazi Jews, French Canadians of southeastern Quebec, the Old Order Amish of Pennsylvania, and the Cajuns of southern Louisiana, the condition is more common. Approximately 1 in 3,600 Ashkenazi Jews at birth are affected. The disease is named after British ophthalmologist Waren Tay, who in 1881 first described a symptomatic red spot on the retina of the eye; and American neurologist Bernard Sachs, who described in 1887 the cellular changes and noted an increased rate of disease in Ashkenazi Jews. Carriers of a single Tay‚ÄìSachs allele are typically normal. It has been hypothesized that being a carrier may confer protection from tuberculosis, explaining the persistence of the allele in certain populations. Researchers are looking at gene therapy or enzyme replacement therapy as possible treatments.  Signs and symptoms  Tay‚ÄìSachs disease is typically first noticed in infants around 6 months old displaying an abnormally strong response to sudden noises or other stimuli, known as the \\"startle response\\". There may also be listlessness or muscle stiffness (hypertonia). The disease is classified into several forms, which are differentiated based on the onset age of neurological symptoms.  Infantile  Infants with Tay‚ÄìSachs disease appear to develop normally for the first six months after birth. Then, as neurons become distended with GM2 gangliosides, a relentless deterioration of mental and physical abilities begins. The child may become blind, deaf, unable to swallow, atrophied, and paralytic. Death usually occurs before the age of four.  Juvenile  Juvenile Tay‚ÄìSachs disease is rarer than other forms of Tay‚ÄìSachs, and usually is initially seen in children between two and ten years old. People with Tay‚ÄìSachs disease experience cognitive and motor skill deterioration, dysarthria, dysphagia, ataxia, and spasticity. Death usually occurs between the ages of five and fifteen years.  Late-onset  A rare form of this disease, known as Adult-Onset or Late-Onset Tay‚ÄìSachs disease, usually has its first symptoms during the 30s or 40s. In contrast to the other forms, late- onset Tay‚ÄìSachs disease is usually not fatal as the effects can stop progressing. It is frequently misdiagnosed. It is characterized by unsteadiness of gait and progressive neurological deterioration. Symptoms of late-onset Tay‚ÄìSachs ‚Äì which typically begin to be seen in adolescence or early adulthood ‚Äì include speech and swallowing difficulties, unsteadiness of gait, spasticity, cognitive decline, and psychiatric illness, particularly a schizophrenia-like psychosis. People with late-onset Tay‚ÄìSachs may become full-time wheelchair users in adulthood. Until the 1970s and 1980s, when the disease's molecular genetics became known, the juvenile and adult forms of the disease were not always recognized as variants of Tay‚ÄìSachs disease. Post- infantile Tay‚ÄìSachs was often misdiagnosed as another neurological disorder, such as Friedreich's ataxia. Genetics Tay‚ÄìSachs disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The HEXA gene is located on the long (q) arm of human chromosome 15, between positions 23 and 24. Tay‚ÄìSachs disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder, meaning that when both parents are carriers, there is a 25% risk of giving birth to an affected child with each pregnancy. The affected child would have received a mutated copy of the gene from each parent. Tay‚ÄìSachs results from mutations in the HEXA gene on chromosome 15, which encodes the alpha-subunit of beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase A, a lysosomal enzyme. By 2000, more than 100 different mutations had been identified in the human HEXA gene. These mutations have included single base insertions and deletions, splice phase mutations, missense mutations, and other more complex patterns. Each of these mutations alters the gene's protein product (i.e., the enzyme), sometimes severely inhibiting its function. In recent years, population studies and pedigree analysis have shown how such mutations arise and spread within small founder populations. Initial research focused on several such founder populations: * Ashkenazi Jews. A four base pair insertion in exon 11 (1278insTATC) results in an altered reading frame for the HEXA gene. This mutation is the most prevalent mutation in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, and leads to the infantile form of Tay‚ÄìSachs disease. * Cajuns. The same 1278insTATC mutation found among Ashkenazi Jews occurs in the Cajun population of southern Louisiana. Researchers have traced the ancestry of carriers from Louisiana families back to a single founder couple ‚Äì not known to be Jewish ‚Äì who lived in France in the 18th century. * French Canadians. Two mutations, unrelated to the Ashkenazi/Cajun mutation, are absent in France but common among certain French-Canadian communities living in southeastern Quebec and Acadians from the Province of New Brunswick. Pedigree analysis suggests the mutations were uncommon before the late 17th century. In the 1960s and early 1970s, when the biochemical basis of Tay‚ÄìSachs disease was first becoming known, no mutations had been sequenced directly for genetic diseases. Researchers of that era did not yet know how common polymorphisms would prove to be. The \\"Jewish Fur Trader Hypothesis,\\" with its implication that a single mutation must have spread from one population into another, reflected the knowledge at the time. Subsequent research, however, has proven that a large variety of different HEXA mutations can cause the disease. Because Tay‚ÄìSachs was one of the first genetic disorders for which widespread genetic screening was possible, it is one of the first genetic disorders in which the prevalence of compound heterozygosity has been demonstrated. Compound heterozygosity ultimately explains the disease's variability, including the late-onset forms. The disease can potentially result from the inheritance of two unrelated mutations in the HEXA gene, one from each parent. Classic infantile Tay‚ÄìSachs disease results when a child has inherited mutations from both parents that completely stop the biodegradation of gangliosides. Late onset forms occur due to the diverse mutation base ‚Äì people with Tay‚ÄìSachs disease may technically be heterozygotes, with two differing HEXA mutations that both inactivate, alter, or inhibit enzyme activity. When a patient has at least one HEXA copy that still enables some level of hexosaminidase A activity, a later onset disease form occurs. When disease occurs because of two unrelated mutations, the patient is said to be a compound heterozygote. Heterozygous carriers (individuals who inherit one mutant allele) show abnormal enzyme activity but manifest no disease symptoms. This phenomenon is called dominance; the biochemical reason for wild-type alleles' dominance over nonfunctional mutant alleles in inborn errors of metabolism comes from how enzymes function. Enzymes are protein catalysts for chemical reactions; as catalysts, they speed up reactions without being used up in the process, so only small enzyme quantities are required to carry out a reaction. Someone homozygous for a nonfunctional mutation in the enzyme- encoding gene has little or no enzyme activity, so will manifest the abnormal phenotype. A heterozygote (heterozygous individual) has at least half of the normal enzyme activity level, due to expression of the wild-type allele. This level is normally enough to enable normal function and thus prevent phenotypic expression. Pathophysiology Tay‚ÄìSachs disease is caused by insufficient activity of the enzyme hexosaminidase A. Hexosaminidase A is a vital hydrolytic enzyme, found in the lysosomes, that breaks down sphingolipids. When hexosaminidase A is no longer functioning properly, the lipids accumulate in the brain and interfere with normal biological processes. Hexosaminidase A specifically breaks down fatty acid derivatives called gangliosides; these are made and biodegraded rapidly in early life as the brain develops. Patients with and carriers of Tay‚ÄìSachs can be identified by a simple blood test that measures hexosaminidase A activity. The hydrolysis of GM2-ganglioside requires three proteins. Two of them are subunits of hexosaminidase A; the third is a small glycolipid transport protein, the GM2 activator protein (GM2A), which acts as a substrate-specific cofactor for the enzyme. Deficiency in any one of these proteins leads to ganglioside storage, primarily in the lysosomes of neurons. Tay‚ÄìSachs disease (along with AB-variant GM2-gangliosidosis and Sandhoff disease) occurs because a mutation inherited from both parents deactivates or inhibits this process. Most Tay‚ÄìSachs mutations probably do not directly affect protein functional elements (e.g., the active site). Instead, they cause incorrect folding (disrupting function) or disable intracellular transport. Diagnosis In patients with a clinical suspicion for Tay‚ÄìSachs disease, with any age of onset, the initial testing involves an enzyme assay to measure the activity of hexosaminidase in serum, fibroblasts, or leukocytes. Total hexosaminidase enzyme activity is decreased in individuals with Tay‚ÄìSachs as is the percentage of hexosaminidase A. After confirmation of decreased enzyme activity in an individual, confirmation by molecular analysis can be pursued. All patients with infantile onset Tay‚ÄìSachs disease have a \\"cherry red\\" macula in the retina, easily observable by a physician using an ophthalmoscope. This red spot is a retinal area that appears red because of gangliosides in the surrounding retinal ganglion cells. The choroidal circulation is showing through \\"red\\" in this foveal region where all retinal ganglion cells are pushed aside to increase visual acuity. Thus, this cherry- red spot is the only normal part of the retina; it shows up in contrast to the rest of the retina. Microscopic analysis of the retinal neurons shows they are distended from excess ganglioside storage. Unlike other lysosomal storage diseases (e.g., Gaucher disease, Niemann‚ÄìPick disease, and Sandhoff disease), hepatosplenomegaly (liver and spleen enlargement) is not seen in Tay‚ÄìSachs. Prevention Three main approaches have been used to prevent or reduce the incidence of Tay‚ÄìSachs: * Prenatal diagnosis. If both parents are identified as carriers, prenatal genetic testing can determine whether the fetus has inherited a defective gene copy from both parents. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS), the most common form of prenatal diagnosis, can be performed between 10 and 14 weeks of gestation. Amniocentesis is usually performed at 15‚Äì18 weeks. These procedures have risks of miscarriage of 1% or less. * Preimplantation genetic diagnosis. By retrieving the mother's eggs for in vitro fertilization, it is possible to test the embryo for the disorder prior to implantation. Healthy embryos are then selected and transferred into the mother's womb, while unhealthy embryos are discarded. In addition to Tay‚ÄìSachs disease, preimplantation genetic diagnosis has been used to prevent cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia among other genetic disorders. * Mate selection. In Orthodox Jewish circles, the organization Dor Yeshorim carries out an anonymous screening program so that carriers for Tay‚ÄìSachs and other genetic disorders can avoid marrying each other. Management As of 2010 there was no treatment that addressed the cause of Tay‚ÄìSachs disease or could slow its progression; people receive supportive care to ease the symptoms and extend life by reducing the chance of contracting infections. Infants are given feeding tubes when they can no longer swallow. In late-onset Tay‚ÄìSachs, medication (e.g., lithium for depression) can sometimes control psychiatric symptoms and seizures, although some medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazines, haloperidol, and risperidone) are associated with significant adverse effects. Outcomes As of 2010, even with the best care, children with infantile Tay‚ÄìSachs disease usually die by the age of 4. Children with the juvenile form are likely to die from the ages 5‚Äì15, while those with the adult form will probably not be affected. Epidemiology Founder effects occur when a small number of individuals from a larger population establish a new population. In this illustration, the original population is on the left with three possible founder populations on the right. Two of the three founder populations are genetically distinct from the original population. Ashkenazi Jews have a high incidence of Tay‚ÄìSachs and other lipid storage diseases. In the United States, about 1 in 27 to 1 in 30 Ashkenazi Jews is a recessive carrier. The disease incidence is about 1 in every 3,500 newborn among Ashkenazi Jews. French Canadians and the Cajun community of Louisiana have an occurrence similar to the Ashkenazi Jews. Irish Americans have a 1 in 50 chance of being a carrier. In the general population, the incidence of carriers as heterozygotes is about 1 in 300. The incidence is approximately 1 in 320,000 newborns in the general population in United States.GM2 Gangliosidoses ‚Äì Introduction And Epidemiology at Medscape. Author: David H Tegay. Updated: Mar 9, 2012 Three general classes of theories have been proposed to explain the high frequency of Tay‚ÄìSachs carriers in the Ashkenazi Jewish population: * Heterozygote advantage. When applied to a particular allele, this theory posits that mutation carriers have a selective advantage, perhaps in a particular environment. * Reproductive compensation. Parents who lose a child because of disease tend to \\"compensate\\" by having additional children to replace them. This phenomenon may maintain and possibly even increase the incidence of autosomal recessive disease. * Founder effect. This hypothesis states that the high incidence of the 1278insTATC chromosomes is the result of an elevated allele frequency that existed by chance in an early founder population. Tay‚ÄìSachs disease was one of the first genetic disorders for which epidemiology was studied using molecular data. Studies of Tay‚ÄìSachs mutations using new molecular techniques such as linkage disequilibrium and coalescence analysis have brought an emerging consensus among researchers supporting the founder effect theory. History Waren Tay and Bernard Sachs are two physicians. They described the disease's progression and provided differential diagnostic criteria to distinguish it from other neurological disorders with similar symptoms. Both Tay and Sachs reported their first cases among Ashkenazi Jewish families. Tay reported his observations in 1881 in the first volume of the proceedings of the British Ophthalmological Society, of which he was a founding member. By 1884, he had seen three cases in a single family. Years later, Bernard Sachs, an American neurologist, reported similar findings when he reported a case of \\"arrested cerebral development\\" to other New York Neurological Society members. Sachs, who recognized that the disease had a familial basis, proposed that the disease should be called amaurotic familial idiocy. However, its genetic basis was still poorly understood. Although Gregor Mendel had published his article on the genetics of peas in 1865, Mendel's paper was largely forgotten for more than a generation ‚Äì not rediscovered by other scientists until 1899. Thus, the Mendelian model for explaining Tay‚ÄìSachs was unavailable to scientists and doctors of the time. The first edition of the Jewish Encyclopedia, published in 12 volumes between 1901 and 1906, described what was then known about the disease: > It is a curious fact that amaurotic family idiocy, a rare and fatal disease > of children, occurs mostly among Jews. The largest number of cases has been > observed in the United States‚Äîover thirty in number. It was at first thought > that this was an exclusively Jewish disease because most of the cases at > first reported were between Russian and Polish Jews; but recently there have > been reported cases occurring in non-Jewish children. The chief > characteristics of the disease are progressive mental and physical > enfeeblement; weakness and paralysis of all the extremities; and marasmus, > associated with symmetrical changes in the macula lutea. On investigation of > the reported cases, they found that neither consanguinity nor syphilitic, > alcoholic, or nervous antecedents in the family history are factors in the > etiology of the disease. No preventive measures have as yet been discovered, > and no treatment has been of benefit, all the cases having terminated > fatally. Jewish immigration to the United States peaked in the period 1880‚Äì1924, with the immigrants arriving from Russia and countries in Eastern Europe; this was also a period of nativism (hostility to immigrants) in the United States. Opponents of immigration often questioned whether immigrants from southern and eastern Europe could be assimilated into American society. Reports of Tay‚ÄìSachs disease contributed to a perception among nativists that Jews were an inferior race. In 1969, Shintaro Okada and John S. O'Brien showed that Tay‚ÄìSachs disease was caused by an enzyme defect; they also proved that Tay‚ÄìSachs patients could be diagnosed by an assay of hexosaminidase A activity. The further development of enzyme assays demonstrated that levels of hexosaminidases A and B could be measured in patients and carriers, allowing the reliable detection of heterozygotes. During the early 1970s, researchers developed protocols for newborn testing, carrier screening, and pre-natal diagnosis. By the end of 1979, researchers had identified three variant forms of GM2 gangliosidosis, including Sandhoff disease and the AB variant of GM2-gangliosidosis, accounting for false negatives in carrier testing. Society and culture Since carrier testing for Tay‚ÄìSachs began in 1971, millions of Ashkenazi Jews have been screened as carriers. Jewish communities embraced the cause of genetic screening from the 1970s on. The success with Tay‚ÄìSachs disease has led Israel to become the first country that offers free genetic screening and counseling for all couples and opened discussions about the proper scope of genetic testing for other disorders in Israel. Because Tay‚ÄìSachs disease was one of the first autosomal recessive genetic disorders for which there was an enzyme assay test (prior to polymerase chain reaction testing methods), it was intensely studied as a model for all such diseases, and researchers sought evidence of a selective process. A continuing controversy is whether heterozygotes (carriers) have or had a selective advantage. The presence of four different lysosomal storage disorders in the Ashkenazi Jewish population suggests a past selective advantage for heterozygous carriers of these conditions.\\" This controversy among researchers has reflected three debates among geneticists at large: * Dominance versus overdominance. In applied genetics (selective and agricultural breeding), this controversy has reflected the century-long debate over whether dominance or overdominance provides the best explanation for heterosis (hybrid vigor). * The classical/balance controversy. The classical hypothesis of genetic variability, often associated with Hermann Muller, maintains that most genes are of a normal wild type, and that most individuals are homozygous for that wild type, while most selection is purifying selection that operates to eliminate deleterious alleles. The balancing hypothesis, often associated with Theodosius Dobzhansky, states that heterozygosity will be common at loci, and that it frequently reflects either directional selection or balancing selection. * Selectionists versus neutralists. In theoretical population genetics, selectionists emphasize the primacy of natural selection as a determinant of evolution and of variation within a population, while neutralists favor a form of Motoo Kimura's neutral theory of molecular evolution, which emphasizes the role of genetic drift. Research directions Enzyme replacement therapy Enzyme replacement therapy techniques have been investigated for lysosomal storage disorders, and could potentially be used to treat Tay‚ÄìSachs as well. The goal would be to replace the nonfunctional enzyme, a process similar to insulin injections for diabetes. However, in previous studies, the HEXA enzyme itself has been thought to be too large to pass through the specialized cell layer in the blood vessels that forms the blood‚Äìbrain barrier in humans. Researchers have also tried directly instilling the deficient enzyme hexosaminidase A into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which bathes the brain. However, intracerebral neurons seem unable to take up this physically large molecule efficiently even when it is directly by them. Therefore, this approach to treatment of Tay‚ÄìSachs disease has also been ineffective so far. Jacob sheep model Tay‚ÄìSachs disease exists in Jacob sheep. The biochemical mechanism for this disease in the Jacob sheep is virtually identical to that in humans, wherein diminished activity of hexosaminidase A results in increased concentrations of GM2 ganglioside in the affected animal. Sequencing of the HEXA gene cDNA of affected Jacobs sheep reveal an identical number of nucleotides and exons as in the human HEXA gene, and 86% nucleotide sequence identity. A missense mutation (G444R) was found in the HEXA cDNA of the affected sheep. This mutation is a single nucleotide change at the end of exon 11, resulting in that exon's deletion (before translation) via splicing. The Tay‚ÄìSachs model provided by the Jacob sheep is the first to offer promise as a means for gene therapy clinical trials, which may prove useful for disease treatment in humans. Substrate reduction therapy Other experimental methods being researched involve substrate reduction therapy, which attempts to use alternative enzymes to increase the brain's catabolism of GM2 gangliosides to a point where residual degradative activity is sufficient to prevent substrate accumulation. One experiment has demonstrated that using the enzyme sialidase allows the genetic defect to be effectively bypassed, and as a consequence, GM2 gangliosides are metabolized so that their levels become almost inconsequential. If a safe pharmacological treatment can be developed ‚Äì one that increases expression of lysosomal sialidase in neurons without other toxicity ‚Äì then this new form of therapy could essentially cure the disease. Another metabolic therapy under investigation for Tay‚ÄìSachs disease uses miglustat. This drug is a reversible inhibitor of the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase, which catalyzes the first step in synthesizing glucose-based glycosphingolipids like GM2 ganglioside. Increasing Œ≤-hexosaminidase A activity As Tay‚ÄìSachs disease is a deficiency of Œ≤-hexosaminidase A, deterioration of affected individuals could be slowed or stopped through the use of a substance that increases its activity. However, since in infantile Tay‚ÄìSachs disease there is no Œ≤-hexosaminidase A, the treatment would be ineffective, but for people affected by Late-Onset Tay‚ÄìSachs disease, Œ≤-hexosaminidase A is present, so the treatment may be effective. The drug pyrimethamine has been shown to increase activity of Œ≤-hexosaminidase A. However, the increased levels of Œ≤-hexosaminidase A still fall far short of the desired \\"10% of normal HEXA\\", above which the phenotypic symptoms begin to disappear.  Cord blood transplant  This is a highly invasive procedure which involves destroying the patient's blood system with chemotherapy and administering cord blood. Of five people who had received the treatment as of 2008, two were still alive after five years and they still had a great deal of health problems. Critics point to its harsh nature, and that it is unapproved. It is also hard for the blood to cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier, as well as very expensive, as each unit of cord blood costs $25,000 and adults need many units of cord blood.

It is characterized by multiple movement (motor) tics and at least one vocal (phonic) tic. Common tics are blinking, coughing, throat clearing, sniffing, and facial movements. These are typically preceded by an unwanted urge or sensation in the affected muscles, can sometimes be suppressed temporarily, and characteristically change in location, strength, and frequency. Tourette's is at the more severe end of a spectrum of tic disorders. The tics often go unnoticed by casual observers. Tourette's was once regarded as a rare and bizarre syndrome and has popularly been associated with coprolalia (the utterance of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks). It is no longer considered rare; about 1% of school-age children and adolescents are estimated to have Tourette's, and coprolalia occurs only in a minority. There are no specific tests for diagnosing Tourette's; it is not always correctly identified, because most cases are mild, and the severity of tics decreases for most children as they pass through adolescence. Therefore, many go undiagnosed or may never seek medical attention. Extreme Tourette's in adulthood, though sensationalized in the media, is rare, but for a small minority, severely debilitating tics can persist into adulthood. Tourette's does not affect intelligence or life expectancy. There is no cure for Tourette's and no single most effective medication. In most cases, medication for tics is not necessary, and behavioral therapies are the first-line treatment. Education is an important part of any treatment plan, and explanation alone often provides sufficient reassurance that no other treatment is necessary. Among those who are referred to specialty clinics, other conditions like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder (OCD) are more likely than in the broader population of persons with Tourette's. These co-occurring diagnoses often cause more impairment to the individual than the tics; hence it is important to correctly distinguish co-occurring conditions and treat them. Tourette syndrome was named by French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot for his intern, Georges Gilles de la Tourette, who published in 1885 an account of nine patients with a \\"convulsive tic disorder\\". While the exact cause is unknown, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The mechanism appears to involve dysfunction in neural circuits between the basal ganglia and related structures in the brain.  Classification  Tourette syndrome is classified as a motor disorder (a disorder of the nervous system that causes abnormal and involuntary movements). It is listed in the neurodevelopmental disorder category of the fifth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published in 2013. Tourette's is at the more severe end of the spectrum of tic disorders; its diagnosis requires multiple motor tics and at least one vocal tic to be present for more than a year. Tics are sudden, repetitive, nonrhythmic movements that involve discrete muscle groups, while vocal (phonic) tics involve laryngeal, pharyngeal, oral, nasal or respiratory muscles to produce sounds. The tics must not be explained by other medical conditions or substance use. Other conditions on the spectrum include persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tics, in which one type of tic (motor or vocal, but not both) has been present for more than a year; and provisional tic disorder, in which motor or vocal tics have been present for less than one year. The fifth edition of the DSM replaced what had been called transient tic disorder with provisional tic disorder, recognizing that \\"transient\\" can only be defined in retrospect. Some experts believe that TS and persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder should be considered the same condition, because vocal tics are also motor tics in the sense that they are muscular contractions of nasal or respiratory muscles.Sukhodolsky, et al (2017), p. 242. Tic disorders are defined only slightly differently by the World Health Organization (WHO); in its ICD-10, the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, TS is described as \\"combined vocal and multiple motor tic disorder [de la Tourette]\\", code F95.2 in chapter V, mental and behavioural disorders, See also ICD version 2007. equivalent to 307.23 in DSM-5, Tourette's disorder. Most published research on TS originates in the United States, and in international research the DSM is preferred over the WHO classification. Genetic studies indicate that tic disorders cover a spectrum that is not recognized by the clear-cut distinctions in the current diagnostic framework. Studies have suggested since 2008 that Tourette's is not a unitary condition with a distinct mechanism as described in the existing classification systems; the studies suggest instead that subtypes should be recognized to distinguish \\"pure TS\\" from TS that is accompanied by attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder (OCD) or other disorders. Elucidation of these subtypes awaits fuller understanding of the genetic and other causes of tic disorders (similar to the subtypes established for other conditions, for example, in distinguishing type 1 and type 2 diabetes).  Characteristics   Tics  Examples of tics Tics are movements or sounds that take place \\"intermittently and unpredictably out of a background of normal motor activity\\", having the appearance of \\"normal behaviors gone wrong\\". The tics associated with Tourette's wax and wane; they change in number, frequency, severity and anatomical location, and each person experiences a unique pattern of fluctuation in their severity and frequency. Tics may also occur in \\"bouts of bouts\\", which also vary among people. The variation in tic severity may occur over hours, days, or weeks. Tics may increase when someone is experiencing stress, fatigue, anxiety, or illness, or when engaged in relaxing activities like watching TV. They sometimes decrease when an individual is engrossed in or focused on an activity like playing a musical instrument. In contrast to the abnormal movements associated with other movement disorders such as choreas, dystonias, myoclonus, and dyskinesias, the tics of Tourette's are nonrhythmic, temporarily suppressible, and often preceded by an unwanted urge. The ability to suppress tics varies among individuals, and may be more developed in adults than children. People with tics are sometimes able to suppress them for limited periods of time, but doing so often results in tension or mental exhaustion. People with Tourette's may seek a secluded spot to release the suppressed urge, or there may be a marked increase in tics after a period of suppression at school or work. Children may suppress tics while in the doctor's office, so they may need to be observed when not aware of being watched. Over time, about 90% of individuals with Tourette's feel an urge preceding the tic, similar to the urge to sneeze or scratch an itch. The urges and sensations that precede the expression of a tic are referred to as premonitory sensory phenomena or premonitory urges. These urges may be physical or mental. People describe the urge to express the tic as a buildup of tension, pressure, or energy which they ultimately choose consciously to release, as if they \\"had to do it\\" to relieve the sensation or until it feels \\"just right\\". Examples of this urge are the feeling of having something in one's throat, or a localized discomfort in the shoulders, which lead to the need to clear one's throat or shrug the shoulders. The actual tic may be felt as relieving this tension or sensation, similar to scratching an itch or blinking to relieve an uncomfortable feeling in the eye. Because of the urges that precede them, tics are described as semi-voluntary or \\"unvoluntary\\", rather than specifically involuntary; they may be experienced as a voluntary, suppressible response to the unwanted premonitory urge. Some people with Tourette's may not be aware of the premonitory urge associated with tics. Children may be less aware of it than are adults, but their awareness tends to increase with maturity; by the age of ten, most children recognize the premonitory urge.Sukhodolsky, et al (2017), p. 243. Complex tics related to speech include coprolalia, echolalia and palilalia. Coprolalia is the spontaneous utterance of socially objectionable or taboo words or phrases. Although it is the most publicized symptom of Tourette's, only about 10% of people with Tourette's exhibit it, and it is not required for a diagnosis. Also see Echolalia (repeating the words of others) and palilalia (repeating one's own words) occur in a minority of cases. Complex motor tics include copropraxia (obscene or forbidden gestures, or inappropriate touching), echopraxia (repetition or imitation of another person's actions) and palipraxia (repeating one's own movements).  Onset and progression  There is no typical case of Tourette syndrome, but the age of onset and the severity of symptoms follow a fairly reliable course. Although onset may occur anytime before eighteen years, the typical age of onset of tics is from five to seven, and is usually before adolescence. A 1998 study from the Yale Child Study Center showed that tic severity increased with age until it reached its highest point between ages eight and twelve. Severity declines steadily for most children as they pass through adolescence, when half to two-thirds of children see a dramatic decrease in tics. Citing Bloch MH (2013) in Martino D, Leckman JF, eds, p. 109: No tics when they reach adulthood, 37%; minimal 18%; mild 26%; moderate 14%; worse 5%. The first tics to appear usually affect the head, face, and shoulders, and include blinking, facial movements, sniffing and throat clearing. Vocal tics often appear months or years after motor tics but can appear first. Among people who experience more severe tics, complex tics may develop, including \\"arm straightening, touching, tapping, jumping, hopping and twirling\\". There are different movements in contrasting disorders (for example, the autism spectrum disorders), such as self-stimulation and stereotypies. These stereotyped movements typically have an earlier age of onset; are more symmetrical, rhythmical and bilateral; and involve the extremities (for example, flapping the hands). The severity of symptoms varies widely among people with Tourette's, and many cases may be undetected.Hollis C, Pennant M, Cuenca J, et al. (January 2016). \\"Clinical effectiveness and patient perspectives of different treatment strategies for tics in children and adolescents with Tourette syndrome: a systematic review and qualitative analysis\\". Health Technology Assessment. Southampton (UK): NIHR Journals Library. 20 (4): 1‚Äì450. . . Most cases are mild and almost unnoticeable; many people with TS may not realize they have tics. Because tics are more commonly expressed in private, Tourette syndrome may go unrecognized, and casual observers might not notice tics. Most adults have mild TS and do not seek medical attention. While tics subside for the majority after adolescence, some of the \\"most severe and debilitating forms of tic disorder are encountered\\" in adults. In some cases, what appear to be adult-onset tics can be childhood tics re-surfacing.  Co- occurring conditions  Andr√© Malraux (center) was a French Minister of Culture, author and adventurer who may have had Tourette syndrome. Because people with milder symptoms are unlikely to be referred to specialty clinics, studies of Tourette's have an inherent bias towards more severe cases.Bloch, State, Pittenger 2011. See also Schapiro 2002 and When symptoms are severe enough to warrant referral to clinics, ADHD and OCD are often also found. In specialty clinics, 30% of those with TS also have mood or anxiety disorders or disruptive behaviors. In the absence of ADHD, tic disorders do not appear to be associated with disruptive behavior or functional impairment, while impairment in school, family, or peer relations is greater in those who have more comorbid conditions. When ADHD is present along with tics, the occurrence of conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder increases. Aggressive behaviors and angry outbursts in people with TS are not well understood; they are not associated with severe tics, but are connected with the presence of ADHD.Sukhodolsky, et al (2017), p. 245. ADHD may also contribute to higher rates of anxiety, and aggression and anger control problems are more likely when both OCD and ADHD co-occur with Tourette's. Compulsions that resemble tics are present in some individuals with OCD; \\"tic-related OCD\\" is hypothesized to be a subgroup of OCD, distinguished from non-tic related OCD by the type and nature of obsessions and compulsions. Compared to the more typical compulsions of OCD without tics that relate to contamination, tic- related OCD presents with more \\"counting, aggressive thoughts, symmetry and touching\\" compulsions. Compulsions associated with OCD without tics are usually related to obsessions and anxiety, while those in tic-related OCD are more likely to be a response to a premonitory urge. There are increased rates of anxiety and depression in those adults with TS who also have OCD. Among individuals with TS studied in clinics, between 2.9% and 20% had autism spectrum disorders, but one study indicates that a high association of autism and TS may be partly due to difficulties distinguishing between tics and tic- like behaviors or OCD symptoms seen in people with autism. Not all people with Tourette's have ADHD or OCD or other comorbid conditions, and estimates of the rate of pure TS or TS-only vary from 15% to 57%; in clinical populations, a high percentage of those under care do have ADHD.Sukhodolsky, et al (2017), p. 244. Children and adolescents with pure TS are not significantly different from their peers without TS on ratings of aggressive behaviors or conduct disorders, or on measures of social adaptation. Similarly, adults with pure TS do not appear to have the social difficulties present in those with TS plus ADHD. Among those with an older age of onset, more substance abuse and mood disorders are found, and there may be self-injurious tics. Adults who have severe, often treatment-resistant tics are more likely to also have mood disorders and OCD. Coprolalia is more likely in people with severe tics plus multiple comorbid conditions.  Neuropsychological function  There are no major impairments in neuropsychological function among people with Tourette's, but conditions that occur along with tics can cause variation in neurocognitive function. A better understanding of comorbid conditions is needed to untangle any neuropsychological differences between TS-only individuals and those with comorbid conditions. Only slight impairments are found in intellectual ability, attentional ability, and nonverbal memory‚Äîbut ADHD, other comorbid disorders, or tic severity could account for these differences. In contrast with earlier findings, visual motor integration and visuoconstructive skills are not found to be impaired, while comorbid conditions may have a small effect on motor skills. Comorbid conditions and severity of tics may account for variable results in verbal fluency, which can be slightly impaired. There might be slight impairment in social cognition, but not in the ability to plan or make decisions. Children with TS-only do not show cognitive deficits. They are faster than average for their age on timed tests of motor coordination, and constant tic suppression may lead to an advantage in switching between tasks because of increased inhibitory control. Learning disabilities may be present, but whether they are due to tics or comorbid conditions is controversial; older studies that reported higher rates of learning disability did not control well for the presence of comorbid conditions. There are often difficulties with handwriting, and disabilities in written expression and math are reported in those with TS plus other conditions.  Causes  The exact cause of Tourette's is unknown, but it is well established that both genetic and environmental factors are involved. Genetic epidemiology studies have shown that Tourette's is highly heritable, and 10 to 100 times more likely to be found among close family members than in the general population. The exact mode of inheritance is not known; no single gene has been identified, and hundreds of genes are likely involved. Genome- wide association studies were published in 2013 and 2015 in which no finding reached a threshold for significance. Twin studies show that 50 to 77% of identical twins share a TS diagnosis, while only 10 to 23% of fraternal twins do. But not everyone who inherits the genetic vulnerability will show symptoms. A few rare highly penetrant genetic mutations have been found that explain only a small number of cases in single families (the SLITRK1, HDC, and CNTNAP2 genes). Psychosocial or other non-genetic factors‚Äîwhile not causing Tourette's‚Äîcan affect the severity of TS in vulnerable individuals and influence the expression of the inherited genes. Pre-natal and peri-natal events increase the risk that a tic disorder or comorbid OCD will be expressed in those with the genetic vulnerability. These include paternal age; forceps delivery; stress or severe nausea during pregnancy; and use of tobacco, caffeine, alcohol, and cannabis during pregnancy. Babies who are born premature with low birthweight, or who have low Apgar scores, are also at increased risk; in premature twins, the lower birthweight twin is more likely to develop TS. Autoimmune processes may affect the onset of tics or exacerbate them. Both OCD and tic disorders may arise in a subset of children as a result of a post-streptococcal autoimmune process. Its potential effect is described by the controversial hypothesis called PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections), which proposes five criteria for diagnosis in children. PANDAS and the newer PANS (pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome) hypotheses are the focus of clinical and laboratory research, but remain unproven. There is also a broader hypothesis that links immune-system abnormalities and immune dysregulation with TS. Some forms of OCD may be genetically linked to Tourette's, although the genetic factors in OCD with and without tics may differ. The genetic relationship of ADHD to Tourette syndrome, however, has not been fully established. A genetic link between autism and Tourette's has not been established as of 2017.  Mechanism  The basal ganglia and thalamus are implicated in Tourette syndrome. The exact mechanism affecting the inherited vulnerability to Tourette's is not well established. Tics are believed to result from dysfunction in cortical and subcortical brain regions: the thalamus, basal ganglia and frontal cortex.Walkup, Mink & Hollenback (2006), p. xv. Neuroanatomic models suggest failures in circuits connecting the brain's cortex and subcortex; imaging techniques implicate the frontal cortex and basal ganglia. In the 2010s, neuroimaging and postmortem brain studies, as well as animal and genetic studies,Sukhodolsky, et al (2017), p. 246. made progress towards better understanding the neurobiological mechanisms leading to Tourette's. These studies support the basal ganglia model, in which neurons in the striatum are activated and inhibit outputs from the basal ganglia. Cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits, or neural pathways, provide inputs to the basal ganglia from the cortex. These circuits connect the basal ganglia with other areas of the brain to transfer information that regulates planning and control of movements, behavior, decision-making, and learning. Behavior is regulated by cross-connections that \\"allow the integration of information\\" from these circuits. Involuntary movements may result from impairments in these CSTC circuits, including the sensorimotor, limbic, language and decision making pathways. Abnormalities in these circuits may be responsible for tics and premonitory urges. The caudate nuclei may be smaller in subjects with tics compared to those without tics, supporting the hypothesis of pathology in CSTC circuits in Tourette's. The ability to suppress tics depends on brain circuits that \\"regulate response inhibition and cognitive control of motor behavior\\". Children with TS are found to have a larger prefrontal cortex, which may be the result of an adaptation to help regulate tics. It is likely that tics decrease with age as the capacity of the frontal cortex increases. Cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuits may also be impaired, contributing to \\"sensory, limbic and executive\\" features. The release of dopamine in the basal ganglia is higher in people with Tourette's, implicating biochemical changes from \\"overactive and dysregulated dopaminergic transmissions\\". Histamine and the H3 receptor may play a role in the alterations of neural circuitry. A reduced level of histamine in the H3 receptor may result in an increase in other neurotransmitters, causing tics. Postmortem studies have also implicated \\"dysregulation of neuroinflammatory processes\\".  Diagnosis  According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), Tourette's may be diagnosed when a person exhibits both multiple motor tics and one or more vocal tics over a period of one year. The motor and vocal tics need not be concurrent. The onset must have occurred before the age of 18 and cannot be attributed to the effects of another condition or substance (such as cocaine). Hence, other medical conditions that include tics or tic-like movements‚Äîfor example, autism or other causes of tics‚Äîmust be ruled out. There are no specific medical or screening tests that can be used to diagnose Tourette's; the diagnosis is usually made based on observation of the individual's symptoms and family history, and after ruling out secondary causes of tic disorders. Tics that may appear to mimic those of Tourette's‚Äîbut are associated with disorders other than Tourette's‚Äîare known as tourettism. Most of these conditions, including dystonias, choreas, and other genetic conditions, are rarer than tic disorders and a thorough history and examination may be enough to rule them out without medical or screening tests. Delayed diagnosis often occurs because professionals mistakenly believe that TS is rare, always involves coprolalia, or must be severely impairing. The DSM has recognized since 2000 that many individuals with Tourette's do not have significant impairment; diagnosis does not require the presence of coprolalia or a comorbid condition, such as ADHD or OCD. Tourette's may be misdiagnosed because of the wide expression of severity, ranging from mild (in the majority of cases) or moderate, to severe (the rare but more widely recognized and publicized cases). About 20% of people with Tourette syndrome do not realize that they have tics. Tics that appear early in the course of TS are often confused with allergies, asthma, vision problems, and other conditions. Pediatricians, allergists and ophthalmologists are among the first to identify a child as having tics, although the majority of tics are first identified by the child's parents.M√ºller-Vahl KR (2013) in Martino D, Leckman JF, eds, p. 625. Coughing, blinking, and tics that mimic unrelated conditions such as asthma are commonly misdiagnosed. In the UK, there is an average delay of three years between symptom onset and diagnosis.  Assessment and screening for other conditions  Patients referred for a tic disorder are assessed based on their family history of tics, vulnerability to ADHD, obsessive‚Äìcompulsive symptoms, and a number of other chronic medical, psychiatric and neurological conditions. In individuals with a typical onset and a family history of tics or OCD, a basic physical and neurological examination may be sufficient. If another condition might better explain the tics, tests may be done; for example, if there is diagnostic confusion between tics and seizure activity, an EEG may be ordered. An MRI can rule out brain abnormalities, but such brain imaging studies are not usually warranted. Measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone blood levels can rule out hypothyroidism, which can be a cause of tics. In teenagers and adults presenting with a sudden onset of tics and other behavioral symptoms, a urine drug screen for cocaine and stimulants might be necessary. If there is a family history of liver disease, serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels can rule out Wilson's disease. Although not all those with Tourette's have comorbid conditions, most presenting for clinical care exhibit symptoms of other conditions along with their tics. ADHD and OCD are the most common, but autism spectrum disorders or anxiety, mood, personality, oppositional defiant, and conduct disorders may also be present. Learning disabilities and sleep disorders may be present; higher rates of sleep disturbance and migraine than in the general population are reported. A thorough evaluation for comorbidity is called for when symptoms and impairment warrant,Sukhodolsky, et al (2017), p. 247 and careful assessment of people with TS includes comprehensive screening for these conditions. Comorbid conditions such as OCD and ADHD can be more impairing than tics, and cause greater impact on overall functioning. Disruptive behaviors, impaired functioning, or cognitive impairment in individuals with comorbid Tourette's and ADHD may be accounted for by the ADHD, highlighting the importance of identifying comorbid conditions. Children and adolescents with TS who have learning difficulties are candidates for psychoeducational testing, particularly if the child also has ADHD.  Management  There is no cure for Tourette's. There is no single most effective medication, and no one medication effectively treats all symptoms. Most medications prescribed for tics have not been approved for that use, and no medication is without the risk of significant adverse effects. Treatment is focused on identifying the most troubling or impairing symptoms and helping the individual manage them. Because comorbid conditions are often a larger source of impairment than tics, they are a priority in treatment. The management of Tourette's is individualized and involves shared decision-making between the clinician, patient, family and caregivers.M√ºller-Vahl KR (2013) in Martino D, Leckman JF, eds, p. 628. Practice guidelines for the treatment of tics were published by the American Academy of Neurology in 2019. Education, reassurance and psychobehavioral therapy are often sufficient for the majority of cases. In particular, psychoeducation targeting the patient and their family and surrounding community is a key management strategy. Also see Zinner 2000, . Watchful waiting \\"is an acceptable approach\\" for those who are not functionally impaired. Symptom management may include behavioral, psychological and pharmacological therapies. Pharmacological intervention is reserved for more severe symptoms, while psychotherapy or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may ameliorate depression and social isolation, and improve family support. The decision to use behavioral or pharmacological treatment is \\"usually made after the educational and supportive interventions have been in place for a period of months, and it is clear that the tic symptoms are persistently severe and are themselves a source of impairment in terms of self-esteem, relationships with the family or peers, or school performance\\".Sukhodolsky, et al (2017), p. 248.  Psychoeducation and social support  Knowledge, education and understanding are uppermost in management plans for tic disorders, and psychoeducation is the first step.M√ºller-Vahl KR (2013) in Martino D, Leckman JF, eds, pp. 623‚Äì24. A child's parents are typically the first to notice their tics; they may feel worried, imagine that they are somehow responsible, or feel burdened by misinformation about Tourette's. Effectively educating parents about the diagnosis and providing social support can ease their anxiety. This support can also lower the chance that their child will be unnecessarily medicatedM√ºller-Vahl KR (2013) in Martino D, Leckman JF, eds, p. 626. \\"Quite often, the unimpaired child receives medical treatment to reduce tics, when instead the parents should more appropriately receive psychoeducation and social support to better cope with the condition.\\" or experience an exacerbation of tics due to their parents' emotional state. People with Tourette's may suffer socially if their tics are viewed as \\"bizarre\\". If a child has disabling tics, or tics that interfere with social or academic functioning, supportive psychotherapy or school accommodations can be helpful. Even children with milder tics may be angry, depressed or have low self-esteem as a result of increased teasing, bullying, rejection by peers or social stigmatization, and this can lead to social withdrawal. Some children feel empowered by presenting a peer awareness program to their classmates.Pruitt SK & Packer LE (2013) in Martino D, Leckman JF, eds, pp. 646‚Äì47. It can be helpful to educate teachers and school staff about typical tics, how they fluctuate during the day, how they impact the child, and how to distinguish tics from naughty behavior. By learning to identify tics, adults can refrain from asking or expecting a child to stop ticcing,Muller-Vahl KR (2013) in Martino D, Leckman JF, eds, p. 629. because \\"tic suppression can be exhausting, unpleasant, and attention-demanding and can result in a subsequent rebound bout of tics\\". Adults with TS may withdraw socially to avoid stigmatization and discrimination because of their tics.M√ºller-Vahl KR (2013) in Martino D, Leckman JF, eds, p. 627. Depending on their country's healthcare system, they may receive social services or help from support groups.M√ºller-Vahl KR (2013) in Martino D, Leckman JF, eds, p. 633.  Behavioral  Behavioral therapies using habit reversal training (HRT) and exposure and response prevention (ERP) are first-line interventions in the management of Tourette syndrome, and have been shown to be effective. Because tics are somewhat suppressible, when people with TS are aware of the premonitory urge that precedes a tic, they can be trained to develop a response to the urge that competes with the tic. Comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics (CBIT) is based on HRT, the best researched behavioral therapy for tics. TS experts debate whether increasing a child's awareness of tics with HRT/CBIT (as opposed to ignoring tics) can lead to more tics later in life. When disruptive behaviors related to comorbid conditions exist, anger control training and parent management training can be effective.Sudhodolsky, et al (2017), p. 250. CBT is a useful treatment when OCD is present. Relaxation techniques, such as exercise, yoga and meditation may be useful in relieving the stress that can aggravate tics. Beyond HRT, the majority of behavioral interventions for Tourette's (for example, relaxation training and biofeedback) have not been systematically evaluated and are not empirically supported.  Medication  Clonidine is one of the medications typically tried first when medication is needed for Tourette's.Sukhodolsky, et al (2017), p. 251. It is available as a pill or a transdermal (skin) patch. Children with tics typically present when their tics are most severe, but because the condition waxes and wanes, medication is not started immediately or changed often. Tics may subside with education, reassurance and a supportive environment. When medication is used, the goal is not to eliminate symptoms. Instead, the lowest dose that manages symptoms without adverse effects is used, because adverse effects may be more disturbing than the symptoms being treated with medication. The classes of medication with proven efficacy in treating tics‚Äîtypical and atypical neuroleptics‚Äîcan have long-term and short-term adverse effects. Some antihypertensive agents are also used to treat tics; studies show variable efficacy but a lower side effect profile than the neuroleptics. The antihypertensives clonidine and guanfacine are typically tried first in children; they can also help with ADHD symptoms, but there is less evidence that they are effective for adults. The neuroleptics risperidone and aripiprazole are tried when antihypertensives are not effective, and are generally tried first for adults. The most effective medication for tics is haloperidol, but it has a higher risk of side effects. Methylphenidate can be used to treat ADHD that co-occurs with tics, and can be used in combination with clonidine. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are used to manage anxiety and OCD.  Other  Complementary and alternative medicine approaches, such as dietary modification, neurofeedback and allergy testing and control have popular appeal, but they have no proven benefit in the management of Tourette syndrome. Despite this lack of evidence, up to two-thirds of parents, caregivers and individuals with TS use dietary approaches and alternative treatments and do not always inform their physicians. There is low confidence that tics are reduced with tetrahydrocannabinol, and insufficient evidence for other cannabis-based medications in the treatment of Tourette's. There is no good evidence supporting the use of acupuncture or transcranial magnetic stimulation; neither is there evidence supporting intravenous immunoglobulin, plasma exchange, or antibiotics for the treatment of PANDAS. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has become a valid option for individuals with severe symptoms that do not respond to conventional therapy and management. Selecting candidates who may benefit from DBS is challenging, and the appropriate lower age range for surgery is unclear. The ideal brain location to target has not been identified as of 2019.  Pregnancy  A quarter of women report that their tics increase before menstruation, however studies have not shown consistent evidence of a change in frequency or severity of tics related to pregnancy. Overall, symptoms in women respond better to haloperidol than they do for men, and one report found that haloperidol was the preferred medication during pregnancy, to minimize the side effects in the mother, including low blood pressure, and anticholinergic effects. Most women find they can withdraw from medication during pregnancy without much trouble.  Prognosis  Tim Howard, described in 2019 by a staff writer for the Los Angeles Times as the \\"greatest goalkeeper in U.S. soccer history\\", attributes his success in the sport to his Tourette's. Tourette syndrome is a spectrum disorder‚Äîits severity ranges from mild to severe. Symptoms typically subside as children pass through adolescence. In a group of ten children at the average age of highest tic severity (around ten or eleven), almost four will see complete remission by adulthood. Another four will have minimal or mild tics in adulthood, but not complete remission. The remaining two will have moderate or severe tics as adults, but only rarely will their symptoms in adulthood be more severe than in childhood. Regardless of symptom severity, individuals with Tourette's have a normal life span. Symptoms may be lifelong and chronic for some, but the condition is not degenerative or life-threatening. Intelligence among those with pure TS follows a normal curve, although there may be small differences in intelligence in those with comorbid conditions.Pruitt SK & Packer LE (2013) in Martino D, Leckman JF, eds, pp. 636‚Äì37. The severity of tics early in life does not predict their severity in later life. There is no reliable means of predicting the course of symptoms for a particular individual, but the prognosis is generally favorable. By the age of fourteen to sixteen, when the highest tic severity has typically passed, a more reliable prognosis might be made. Tics may be at their highest severity when they are diagnosed, and often improve as an individual's family and friends come to better understand the condition. Studies report that almost eight out of ten children with Tourette's experience a reduction in the severity of their tics by adulthood, and some adults who still have tics may not be aware that they have them. A study that used video to record tics in adults found that nine out of ten adults still had tics, and half of the adults who considered themselves tic- free displayed evidence of mild tics.  Quality of life  People with Tourette's are affected by both the consequences of living with tics as well as efforts to suppress them. Head and eye tics can interfere with reading or lead to headaches, and forceful tics can lead to repetitive strain injury. Severe tics can lead to pain or injuries; as an example, a rare cervical disc herniation was reported from a neck tic. Some people may learn to camouflage socially inappropriate tics or channel the energy of their tics into a functional endeavor. A supportive family and environment generally give those with Tourette's the skills to manage the disorder.Leckman & Cohen (1999), p. 37. \\"For example, individuals who were misunderstood and punished at home and at school for their tics or who were teased mercilessly by peers and stigmatized by their communities will fare worse than a child whose interpersonal environment was more understanding and supportive.\\" Outcomes in adulthood are associated more with the perceived significance of having severe tics as a child than with the actual severity of the tics. A person who was misunderstood, punished or teased at home or at school is likely to fare worse than a child who enjoyed an understanding environment. The long-lasting effects of bullying and teasing can influence self-esteem, self-confidence, and even employment choices and opportunities.M√ºller-Vahl KR (2013) in Martino D, Leckman JF, eds, p. 630. Comorbid ADHD can severely affect the child's well-being in all realms, and extend into adulthood. Factors impacting quality of life change over time, given the natural fluctuating course of tic disorders, the development of coping strategies, and a person's age. As ADHD symptoms improve with maturity, adults report less negative impact in their occupational lives than do children in their educational lives. Tics have a greater impact on adults' psychosocial function, including financial burdens, than they do on children. Adults are more likely to report a reduced quality of life due to depression or anxiety; depression contributes a greater burden than tics to adults' quality of life compared to children. As coping strategies become more effective with age, the impact of OCD symptoms seems to diminish.  Epidemiology  Tourette syndrome is a common but underdiagnosed condition that reaches across all social, racial and ethnic groups. It is three to four times more frequent in males than in females. Observed prevalence rates are higher among children than adults because tics tend to remit or subside with maturity and a diagnosis may no longer be warranted for many adults. Up to 1% of the overall population experiences tic disorders, including chronic tics and transient (provisional or unspecified) tics in childhood. Chronic tics affect 5% of children and transient tics affect up to 20%. Most individuals with tics do not seek a diagnosis, so epidemiological studies of TS \\"reflect a strong ascertainment bias\\" towards those with co- occurring conditions. The reported prevalence of TS varies \\"according to the source, age, and sex of the sample; the ascertainment procedures; and diagnostic system\\", with a range reported between 0.15% and 3.0% for children and adolescents. Sukhodolsky, et al. wrote in 2017 that the best estimate of TS prevalence in children was 1.4%. Both Robertson and Stern state that the prevalence in children is 1%. According to turn of the century census data, these prevalence estimates translate to half a million children in the US with TS and half a million people in the UK with TS, although symptoms in many older individuals would be almost unrecognizable. Tourette syndrome was once thought to be rare: in 1972, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) believed there were fewer than 100 cases in the United States,Cohen, Jankovic & Goetz (2001), p. xviii. and a 1973 registry reported only 485 cases worldwide. However, numerous studies published since 2000 have consistently demonstrated that the prevalence is much higher. Recognizing that tics may often be undiagnosed and hard to detect, newer studies use direct classroom observation and multiple informants (parents, teachers and trained observers), and therefore record more cases than older studies. As the diagnostic threshold and assessment methodology have moved towards recognition of milder cases, the estimated prevalence has increased.  History  Jean-Martin Charcot was a French neurologist and professor who named Tourette syndrome for his intern, Georges Gilles de la Tourette. In A Clinical Lesson at the Salp√™tri√®re (1887), Andr√© Brouillet portrays a medical lecture by Charcot (the central standing figure) and shows de la Tourette in the audience (seated in the first row, wearing an apron). A French doctor, Jean Marc Gaspard Itard, reported the first case of Tourette syndrome in 1825, As cited in describing the Marquise de Dampierre, an important woman of nobility in her time. In 1884, Jean-Martin Charcot, an influential French physician, assigned his studentWalusinski (2019), pp. xvii‚Äìxviii, 23. and intern Georges Gilles de la Tourette, to study patients with movement disorders at the Salp√™tri√®re Hospital, with the goal of defining a condition distinct from hysteria and chorea. In 1885, Gilles de la Tourette published an account in Study of a Nervous Affliction of nine people with \\"convulsive tic disorder\\", concluding that a new clinical category should be defined. As discussed at The eponym was bestowed by Charcot after and on behalf of Gilles de la Tourette, who later became Charcot's senior resident.Walusinski (2019), pp. xi, 398. \\"Interne: House physician or house officer. The internes lived at the hospital and had diagnostic and therapeutic responsibilities. Chef de Clinique: Senior house officer or resident. In 1889, when Gilles de la Tourette was Chef de Clinique under Charcot ... \\" Following the 19th-century descriptions, a psychogenic view prevailed and little progress was made in explaining or treating tics until well into the 20th century. The possibility that movement disorders, including Tourette syndrome, might have an organic origin was raised when an encephalitis lethargica epidemic from 1918 to 1926 was linked to an increase in tic disorders.Blue T (2002). Tourette syndrome. Essortment, Pagewise Inc. Retrieved on August 10, 2009. During the 1960s and 1970s, as the beneficial effects of haloperidol on tics became known, the psychoanalytic approach to Tourette syndrome was questioned. The turning point came in 1965, when Arthur K. Shapiro‚Äîdescribed as \\"the father of modern tic disorder research\\"‚Äîused haloperidol to treat a person with Tourette's, and published a paper criticizing the psychoanalytic approach. In 1975, The New York Times headlined an article with \\"Bizarre outbursts of Tourette's disease victims linked to chemical disorder in brain\\", and Shapiro said: \\"The bizarre symptoms of this illness are rivaled only by the bizarre treatments used to treat it.\\" During the 1990s, a more neutral view of Tourette's emerged, in which a genetic predisposition is seen to interact with non-genetic and environmental factors.Kushner HI (2000), pp. 142‚Äì43, 187, 204, 208‚Äì12. The fourth revision of the DSM (DSM-IV) in 1994 added a diagnostic requirement for \\"marked distress or significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning\\", which led to an outcry from TS experts and researchers, who noted that many people were not even aware they had TS, nor were they distressed by their tics; clinicians and researchers resorted to using the older criteria in research and practice. In 2000, the American Psychiatric Association revised its diagnostic criteria in the fourth text revision of the DSM (DSM-IV-TR) to remove the impairment requirement, recognizing that clinicians often see people who have Tourette's without distress or impairment.  Society and culture  Samuel Johnson c. 1772. Johnson is likely to have had Tourette syndrome. Not everyone with Tourette's wants treatment or a cure, especially if that means they may lose something else in the process.Leckman & Cohen (1999), p. 408. The researchers Leckman and Cohen believe that there may be latent advantages associated with an individual's genetic vulnerability to developing Tourette syndrome that may have adaptive value, such as heightened awareness and increased attention to detail and surroundings.Leckman & Cohen (1999), pp. 18‚Äì19, 148‚Äì51, 408.M√ºller-Vahl KR (2013) in Martino D, Leckman JF, eds. p. 624.\\"... a few 'positive' aspects may be closely linked to TS. People with TS, for example, may have positive personality characterisics and talents such as punctuality, correctness, conscientiousness, a sense of justice, quick comprehension, good intelligence, creativity, musicality, and athletic abilities. For that reason, some people with TS even hesitate when asked whether they wish the disorder would disappear completely.\\" Accomplished musicians, athletes, public speakers and professionals from all walks of life are found among people with Tourette's.Portraits of adults with TS.

The entertainment industry has been criticized for depicting those with Tourette syndrome as social misfits whose only tic is coprolalia, which has furthered the public's misunderstanding and stigmatization of those with Tourette's. The coprolalic symptoms of Tourette's are also fodder for radio and television talk shows in the USUS media: and for the British media. High-profile media coverage focuses on treatments that do not have established safety or efficacy, such as deep brain stimulation, and alternative therapies involving unstudied efficacy and side effects are pursued by many parents.  Research directions  Research since 1999 has advanced knowledge of Tourette's in the areas of genetics, neuroimaging, neurophysiology, and neuropathology, but questions remain about how best to classify it and how closely it is related to other movement or psychiatric disorders. Modeled after genetic breakthroughs seen with large- scale efforts in other neurodevelopmental disorders, three groups are collaborating in research of the genetics of Tourette's: *The Tourette Syndrome Association International Consortium for Genetics (TSAICG) *Tourette International Collaborative Genetics Study (TIC Genetics) *European Multicentre Tics in Children Studies (EMTICS) Compared to the progress made in gene discovery in certain neurodevelopmental or mental health disorders‚Äîautism, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder‚Äîthe scale of related TS research is lagging in the United States due to funding.

The exact frequency response of the filter depends on the filter design. The filter is sometimes called a high-cut filter, or treble-cut filter in audio applications. A low-pass filter is the complement of a high-pass filter. In optics, high-pass and low-pass may have different meanings, depending on whether referring to frequency or wavelength of light, since these variables are inversely related. High-pass frequency filters would act as low-pass wavelength filters, and vice versa. For this reason it is a good practice to refer to wavelength filters as \\"Short-pass\\" and \\"Long-pass\\" to avoid confusion, which would correspond to \\"high-pass\\" and \\"low-pass\\" frequencies . Low-pass filters exist in many different forms, including electronic circuits such as a hiss filter used in audio, anti- aliasing filters for conditioning signals prior to analog-to-digital conversion, digital filters for smoothing sets of data, acoustic barriers, blurring of images, and so on. The moving average operation used in fields such as finance is a particular kind of low-pass filter, and can be analyzed with the same signal processing techniques as are used for other low-pass filters. Low-pass filters provide a smoother form of a signal, removing the short-term fluctuations and leaving the longer-term trend. Filter designers will often use the low-pass form as a prototype filter. That is, a filter with unity bandwidth and impedance. The desired filter is obtained from the prototype by scaling for the desired bandwidth and impedance and transforming into the desired bandform (that is low-pass, high-pass, band-pass or band- stop). Examples Examples of low-pass filters occur in acoustics, optics and electronics. A stiff physical barrier tends to reflect higher sound frequencies, and so acts as an acoustic low-pass filter for transmitting sound. When music is playing in another room, the low notes are easily heard, while the high notes are attenuated. An optical filter with the same function can correctly be called a low-pass filter, but conventionally is called a longpass filter (low frequency is long wavelength), to avoid confusion. In an electronic low-pass RC filter for voltage signals, high frequencies in the input signal are attenuated, but the filter has little attenuation below the cutoff frequency determined by its RC time constant. For current signals, a similar circuit, using a resistor and capacitor in parallel, works in a similar manner. (See current divider discussed in more detail below.) Electronic low-pass filters are used on inputs to subwoofers and other types of loudspeakers, to block high pitches that they can't efficiently reproduce. Radio transmitters use low-pass filters to block harmonic emissions that might interfere with other communications. The tone knob on many electric guitars is a low-pass filter used to reduce the amount of treble in the sound. An integrator is another time constant low-pass filter. Telephone lines fitted with DSL splitters use low-pass and high-pass filters to separate DSL and POTS signals sharing the same pair of wires. Low-pass filters also play a significant role in the sculpting of sound created by analogue and virtual analogue synthesisers. See subtractive synthesis. A low-pass filter is used as an anti-aliasing filter prior to sampling and for reconstruction in digital- to-analog conversion. Ideal and real filters The sinc function, the time- domain impulse response of an ideal low-pass filter. dB decline reflects an additional half-power attenuation). Angular frequency is shown on a logarithmic scale in units of radians per second. An ideal low-pass filter completely eliminates all frequencies above the cutoff frequency while passing those below unchanged; its frequency response is a rectangular function and is a brick-wall filter. The transition region present in practical filters does not exist in an ideal filter. An ideal low-pass filter can be realized mathematically (theoretically) by multiplying a signal by the rectangular function in the frequency domain or, equivalently, convolution with its impulse response, a sinc function, in the time domain. However, the ideal filter is impossible to realize without also having signals of infinite extent in time, and so generally needs to be approximated for real ongoing signals, because the sinc function's support region extends to all past and future times. The filter would therefore need to have infinite delay, or knowledge of the infinite future and past, in order to perform the convolution. It is effectively realizable for pre-recorded digital signals by assuming extensions of zero into the past and future, or more typically by making the signal repetitive and using Fourier analysis. Real filters for real-time applications approximate the ideal filter by truncating and windowing the infinite impulse response to make a finite impulse response; applying that filter requires delaying the signal for a moderate period of time, allowing the computation to \\"see\\" a little bit into the future. This delay is manifested as phase shift. Greater accuracy in approximation requires a longer delay. An ideal low-pass filter results in ringing artifacts via the Gibbs phenomenon. These can be reduced or worsened by choice of windowing function, and the design and choice of real filters involves understanding and minimizing these artifacts. For example, \\"simple truncation [of sinc] causes severe ringing artifacts,\\" in signal reconstruction, and to reduce these artifacts one uses window functions \\"which drop off more smoothly at the edges.\\"Mastering Windows: Improving Reconstruction The Whittaker‚ÄìShannon interpolation formula describes how to use a perfect low-pass filter to reconstruct a continuous signal from a sampled digital signal. Real digital-to-analog converters use real filter approximations. Time response The time response of a low-pass filter is found by solving the response to the simple low-pass RC filter. RC filter Using Kirchhoff's Laws we arrive at the differential equation :v_{\\\\text{out}}(t) = v_{\\\\text{in}}(t) - RC \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d}v_{\\\\text{out}}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t}  Step input response example  If we let v_{\\\\text{in}}(t) be a step function of magnitude V_i then the differential equation has the solution :v_{\\\\text{out}}(t) = V_i (1 - e^{-\\\\omega_0 t}) Where \\\\omega_0 = {1 \\\\over RC} is the cutoff frequency of the filter  Frequency response  The most common way to characterize the frequency response of a circuit is to find its Laplace transform transfer function, H(s) = {V_{out}(s) \\\\over V_{in}(s)}. Taking the Laplace transform of our differential equation and solving for H(s) we get :H(s) = {V_{out}(s) \\\\over V_{in}(s)} = {\\\\omega_0 \\\\over (s + \\\\omega_0)}  Difference equation through discrete time sampling  A discrete difference equation is easily obtained by sampling the step input response above at regular intervals of nT where n = 0, 1, ... and T is the time between samples. Taking the difference between two consecutive samples we have :v_{out}(nT) - v_{out}((n-1)T) = V_i (1 - e^{-\\\\omega_0 nT}) - V_i (1 - e^{-\\\\omega_0 ((n-1)T)}) Solving for v_{out}(nT) we get :v_{out}(nT) = \\\\beta v_{out}((n-1)T) + (1-\\\\beta)V_i Where \\\\beta = e^{-\\\\omega_0 T} Using the notation V_n = v_{out}(nT) and v_n = v_{in}(nT), and substituting our sampled value, v_n = V_i, we get the difference equation :V_n = \\\\beta V_{n-1} + (1-\\\\beta)v_n  Error analysis  Comparing the reconstructed output signal from the difference equation, V_n = \\\\beta V_{n-1} + (1-\\\\beta)v_n, to the step input response, v_{\\\\text{out}}(t) = V_i (1 - e^{-\\\\omega_0 t}), we find that there is an exact reconstruction (0% error). This is the reconstructed output for a time invariant input. However, if the input is time variant, such as v_{\\\\text{in}}(t) = V_i sin(\\\\omega t), this model approximates the input signal as a series of step functions with duration T producing an error in the reconstructed output signal. The error produced from time variant inputs is difficult to quantify but decreases as T\\\\rightarrow0. Discrete-time realization Many digital filters are designed to give low-pass characteristics. Both infinite impulse response and finite impulse response low pass filters as well as filters using Fourier transforms are widely used. Simple infinite impulse response filter The effect of an infinite impulse response low-pass filter can be simulated on a computer by analyzing an RC filter's behavior in the time domain, and then discretizing the model. RC filter From the circuit diagram to the right, according to Kirchhoff's Laws and the definition of capacitance: (t) - v_{\\\\text{out}}(t) = R \\\\; i(t)}} (t)}} where Q_c(t) is the charge stored in the capacitor at time \\\\scriptstyle t. Substituting equation into equation gives \\\\scriptstyle i(t) \\\\;=\\\\; C \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d}v_{\\\\text{out}}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t}, which can be substituted into equation so that: :v_{\\\\text{in}}(t) - v_{\\\\text{out}}(t) = RC \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d}v_{\\\\text{out}}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t} This equation can be discretized. For simplicity, assume that samples of the input and output are taken at evenly spaced points in time separated by \\\\scriptstyle \\\\Delta_T time. Let the samples of \\\\scriptstyle v_{\\\\text{in}} be represented by the sequence \\\\scriptstyle (x_1,\\\\, x_2,\\\\, \\\\ldots,\\\\, x_n), and let \\\\scriptstyle v_{\\\\text{out}} be represented by the sequence \\\\scriptstyle (y_1,\\\\, y_2,\\\\, \\\\ldots,\\\\, y_n), which correspond to the same points in time. Making these substitutions: :x_i - y_i = RC \\\\, \\\\frac{y_{i}-y_{i-1}}{\\\\Delta_T} And rearranging terms gives the recurrence relation :y_i = \\\\overbrace{x_i \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\Delta_T}{RC + \\\\Delta_T} \\\\right)}^{\\\\text{Input contribution}} + \\\\overbrace{y_{i-1} \\\\left( \\\\frac{RC}{RC + \\\\Delta_T} \\\\right)}^{\\\\text{Inertia from previous output}}. That is, this discrete-time implementation of a simple RC low-pass filter is the exponentially weighted moving average :y_i = \\\\alpha x_i + (1 - \\\\alpha) y_{i-1} \\\\qquad \\\\text{where} \\\\qquad \\\\alpha := \\\\frac{\\\\Delta_T}{RC + \\\\Delta_T} By definition, the smoothing factor \\\\scriptstyle 0 \\\\;\\\\leq\\\\; \\\\alpha \\\\;\\\\leq\\\\; 1. The expression for \\\\scriptstyle \\\\alpha yields the equivalent time constant \\\\scriptstyle RC in terms of the sampling period \\\\scriptstyle \\\\Delta_T and smoothing factor \\\\scriptstyle \\\\alpha: :RC = \\\\Delta_T \\\\left( \\\\frac{1 - \\\\alpha}{\\\\alpha} \\\\right) Recalling that :f_c=\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi RC} so RC=\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi f_c} then \\\\alpha and f_c are related by: :\\\\alpha = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi \\\\Delta_T f_c}{2\\\\pi \\\\Delta_T f_c + 1} and :f_c=\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{(1 - \\\\alpha)2\\\\pi \\\\Delta_T}. If \\\\alpha \\\\;=\\\\; 0.5, then the RC time constant is equal to the sampling period. If \\\\alpha \\\\;\\\\ll\\\\; 0.5, then RC is significantly larger than the sampling interval, and \\\\Delta_T \\\\;\\\\approx\\\\; \\\\alpha RC. The filter recurrence relation provides a way to determine the output samples in terms of the input samples and the preceding output. The following pseudocode algorithm simulates the effect of a low-pass filter on a series of digital samples: // Return RC low-pass filter output samples, given input samples, // time interval dt, and time constant RC function lowpass(real[0..n] x, real dt, real RC) var real[0..n] y var real Œ± := dt / (RC + dt) y[0] := Œ± * x[0] for i from 1 to n y[i] := Œ± * x[i] + (1-Œ±) * y[i-1] return y The loop that calculates each of the n outputs can be refactored into the equivalent: for i from 1 to n y[i] := y[i-1] + Œ± * (x[i] - y[i-1]) That is, the change from one filter output to the next is proportional to the difference between the previous output and the next input. This exponential smoothing property matches the exponential decay seen in the continuous-time system. As expected, as the time constant \\\\scriptstyle RC increases, the discrete-time smoothing parameter \\\\scriptstyle \\\\alpha decreases, and the output samples \\\\scriptstyle (y_1,\\\\, y_2,\\\\, \\\\ldots,\\\\, y_n) respond more slowly to a change in the input samples \\\\scriptstyle (x_1,\\\\, x_2,\\\\, \\\\ldots,\\\\, x_n); the system has more inertia. This filter is an infinite-impulse-response (IIR) single-pole low-pass filter. Finite impulse response Finite-impulse-response filters can be built that approximate to the sinc function time-domain response of an ideal sharp-cutoff low-pass filter. For minimum distortion the finite impulse response filter has an unbounded number of coefficients operating on an unbounded signal. In practice, the time-domain response must be time truncated and is often of a simplified shape; in the simplest case, a running average can be used, giving a square time response.Whilmshurst, T H (1990) Signal recovery from noise in electronic instrumentation. Fourier transform For non-realtime filtering, to achieve a low pass filter, the entire signal is usually taken as a looped signal, the Fourier transform is taken, filtered in the frequency domain, followed by an inverse Fourier transform. Only O(n log(n)) operations are required compared to O(n2) for the time domain filtering algorithm. This can also sometimes be done in real-time, where the signal is delayed long enough to perform the Fourier transformation on shorter, overlapping blocks. Continuous-time realization Plot of the gain of Butterworth low-pass filters of orders 1 through 5, with cutoff frequency \\\\omega_0 = 1. Note that the slope is 20n dB/decade where n is the filter order. There are many different types of filter circuits, with different responses to changing frequency. The frequency response of a filter is generally represented using a Bode plot, and the filter is characterized by its cutoff frequency and rate of frequency rolloff. In all cases, at the cutoff frequency, the filter attenuates the input power by half or 3 dB. So the order of the filter determines the amount of additional attenuation for frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency. * A first-order filter, for example, reduces the signal amplitude by half (so power reduces by a factor of 4, or , every time the frequency doubles (goes up one octave); more precisely, the power rolloff approaches 20 dB per decade in the limit of high frequency. The magnitude Bode plot for a first-order filter looks like a horizontal line below the cutoff frequency, and a diagonal line above the cutoff frequency. There is also a \\"knee curve\\" at the boundary between the two, which smoothly transitions between the two straight line regions. If the transfer function of a first- order low-pass filter has a zero as well as a pole, the Bode plot flattens out again, at some maximum attenuation of high frequencies; such an effect is caused for example by a little bit of the input leaking around the one-pole filter; this one-pole‚Äìone-zero filter is still a first-order low-pass. See Pole‚Äìzero plot and RC circuit. * A second-order filter attenuates high frequencies more steeply. The Bode plot for this type of filter resembles that of a first-order filter, except that it falls off more quickly. For example, a second-order Butterworth filter reduces the signal amplitude to one fourth its original level every time the frequency doubles (so power decreases by 12 dB per octave, or 40 dB per decade). Other all-pole second-order filters may roll off at different rates initially depending on their Q factor, but approach the same final rate of 12 dB per octave; as with the first-order filters, zeroes in the transfer function can change the high-frequency asymptote. See RLC circuit. * Third- and higher-order filters are defined similarly. In general, the final rate of power rolloff for an order-\\\\scriptstyle n all-pole filter is \\\\scriptstyle 6n dB per octave (i.e., \\\\scriptstyle 20n dB per decade). On any Butterworth filter, if one extends the horizontal line to the right and the diagonal line to the upper-left (the asymptotes of the function), they intersect at exactly the cutoff frequency. The frequency response at the cutoff frequency in a first-order filter is 3 dB below the horizontal line. The various types of filters (Butterworth filter, Chebyshev filter, Bessel filter, etc.) all have different-looking knee curves. Many second-order filters have \\"peaking\\" or resonance that puts their frequency response at the cutoff frequency above the horizontal line. Furthermore, the actual frequency where this peaking occurs can be predicted without calculus, as shown by CartwrightK. V. Cartwright, P. Russell and E. J. Kaminsky,\\"Finding the maximum magnitude response (gain) of second-order filters without calculus,\\" Lat. Am. J. Phys. Educ. Vol. 6, No. 4, pp. 559-565, 2012. et al. For third-order filters, the peaking and its frequency of occurrence can also be predicted without calculus as shown by Cartwright et al. See electronic filter for other types. The meanings of 'low' and 'high'‚Äîthat is, the cutoff frequency‚Äîdepend on the characteristics of the filter. The term \\"low-pass filter\\" merely refers to the shape of the filter's response; a high-pass filter could be built that cuts off at a lower frequency than any low-pass filter‚Äîit is their responses that set them apart. Electronic circuits can be devised for any desired frequency range, right up through microwave frequencies (above 1 GHz) and higher. Laplace notation Continuous-time filters can also be described in terms of the Laplace transform of their impulse response, in a way that lets all characteristics of the filter be easily analyzed by considering the pattern of poles and zeros of the Laplace transform in the complex plane. (In discrete time, one can similarly consider the Z-transform of the impulse response.) For example, a first-order low-pass filter can be described in Laplace notation as: : \\\\frac{\\\\text{Output}}{\\\\text{Input}} = K \\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau s + 1} where s is the Laplace transform variable, œÑ is the filter time constant, and K is the gain of the filter in the passband.  Electronic low- pass filters  First order = RC filter = Passive, first order low-pass RC filter One simple low-pass filter circuit consists of a resistor in series with a load, and a capacitor in parallel with the load. The capacitor exhibits reactance, and blocks low-frequency signals, forcing them through the load instead. At higher frequencies the reactance drops, and the capacitor effectively functions as a short circuit. The combination of resistance and capacitance gives the time constant of the filter \\\\scriptstyle \\\\tau \\\\;=\\\\; RC (represented by the Greek letter tau). The break frequency, also called the turnover frequency, corner frequency, or cutoff frequency (in hertz), is determined by the time constant: : f_\\\\mathrm{c} = {1 \\\\over 2 \\\\pi \\\\tau } = {1 \\\\over 2 \\\\pi R C} or equivalently (in radians per second): : \\\\omega_\\\\mathrm{c} = {1 \\\\over \\\\tau} = {1 \\\\over R C} This circuit may be understood by considering the time the capacitor needs to charge or discharge through the resistor: * At low frequencies, there is plenty of time for the capacitor to charge up to practically the same voltage as the input voltage. * At high frequencies, the capacitor only has time to charge up a small amount before the input switches direction. The output goes up and down only a small fraction of the amount the input goes up and down. At double the frequency, there's only time for it to charge up half the amount. Another way to understand this circuit is through the concept of reactance at a particular frequency: * Since direct current (DC) cannot flow through the capacitor, DC input must flow out the path marked \\\\scriptstyle V_\\\\mathrm{out} (analogous to removing the capacitor). * Since alternating current (AC) flows very well through the capacitor, almost as well as it flows through solid wire, AC input flows out through the capacitor, effectively short circuiting to ground (analogous to replacing the capacitor with just a wire). The capacitor is not an \\"on/off\\" object (like the block or pass fluidic explanation above). The capacitor variably acts between these two extremes. It is the Bode plot and frequency response that show this variability. = RL filter= A resistor‚Äìinductor circuit or RL filter is an electric circuit composed of resistors and inductors driven by a voltage or current source. A first order RL circuit is composed of one resistor and one inductor and is the simplest type of RL circuit. A first order RL circuit is one of the simplest analogue infinite impulse response electronic filters. It consists of a resistor and an inductor, either in series driven by a voltage source or in parallel driven by a current source.  Second order  =RLC filter= RLC circuit as a low-pass filter An RLC circuit (the letters R, L and C can be in a different sequence) is an electrical circuit consisting of a resistor, an inductor, and a capacitor, connected in series or in parallel. The RLC part of the name is due to those letters being the usual electrical symbols for resistance, inductance and capacitance respectively. The circuit forms a harmonic oscillator for current and will resonate in a similar way as an LC circuit will. The main difference that the presence of the resistor makes is that any oscillation induced in the circuit will die away over time if it is not kept going by a source. This effect of the resistor is called damping. The presence of the resistance also reduces the peak resonant frequency somewhat. Some resistance is unavoidable in real circuits, even if a resistor is not specifically included as a component. An ideal, pure LC circuit is an abstraction for the purpose of theory. There are many applications for this circuit. They are used in many different types of oscillator circuits. Another important application is for tuning, such as in radio receivers or television sets, where they are used to select a narrow range of frequencies from the ambient radio waves. In this role the circuit is often referred to as a tuned circuit. An RLC circuit can be used as a band-pass filter, band-stop filter, low-pass filter or high-pass filter. The RLC filter is described as a second- order circuit, meaning that any voltage or current in the circuit can be described by a second-order differential equation in circuit analysis.  Higher order passive filters  Higher order passive filters can also be constructed (see diagram for a third order example). A third-order low-pass filter (Cauer topology). The filter becomes a Butterworth filter with cutoff frequency œâc=1 when (for example) C2=4/3 farad, R4=1 ohm, L1=3/2 henry and L3=1/2 henry. Active electronic realization An active low-pass filter Another type of electrical circuit is an active low-pass filter. In the operational amplifier circuit shown in the figure, the cutoff frequency (in hertz) is defined as: :f_{\\\\text{c}} = \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi R_2 C} or equivalently (in radians per second): :\\\\omega_{\\\\text{c}} = \\\\frac{1}{R_2 C} The gain in the passband is ‚àíR2/R1, and the stopband drops off at ‚àí6 dB per octave (that is ‚àí20 dB per decade) as it is a first-order filter.

Signal processing Linear filters Synthesiser modules Filter frequency response Acoustics Sound ","title":"Low-pass filter"},{"id":"56486","text":"A high-pass filter (HPF) is an electronic filter that passes signals with a frequency higher than a certain cutoff frequency and attenuates signals with frequencies lower than the cutoff frequency. The amount of attenuation for each frequency depends on the filter design. A high-pass filter is usually modeled as a linear time-invariant system. It is sometimes called a low-cut filter or bass-cut filter in the context of audio engineering. High-pass filters have many uses, such as blocking DC from circuitry sensitive to non- zero average voltages or radio frequency devices. They can also be used in conjunction with a low-pass filter to produce a bandpass filter. In the optical domain, high-pass and low-pass have the opposite meanings, with a \\"high-pass\\" filter (more commonly \\"long-pass\\") passing only longer wavelengths (lower frequencies), and vice versa for \\"low-pass\\" (more commonly \\"short- pass\\"). First-order continuous-time implementation Figure 1: A passive, analog, first-order high-pass filter, realized by an RC circuit The simple first-order electronic high-pass filter shown in Figure 1 is implemented by placing an input voltage across the series combination of a capacitor and a resistor and using the voltage across the resistor as an output. The transfer function of this linear time-invariant system is: :\\\\frac{V_{out}(s)}{V_{in}(s)}=\\\\frac{sRC}{1+sRC}. The product of the resistance and capacitance (R√óC) is the time constant (œÑ); it is inversely proportional to the cutoff frequency fc, that is, :f_c = \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi \\\\tau} = \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi R C},\\\\, where fc is in hertz, œÑ is in seconds, R is in ohms, and C is in farads. The cutoff frequency is where the pole of the filter levels off the filter's frequency response. Figure 2: An active high-pass filter Figure 2 shows an active electronic implementation of a first-order high-pass filter using an operational amplifier. The transfer function of this linear time- invariant system is: :\\\\frac{V_{out}(s)}{V_{in}(s)}=\\\\frac{-sR_2C}{1+sR_1C}. In this case, the filter has a passband gain of -R2/R1 and has a cutoff frequency of :f_c = \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi \\\\tau} = \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi R_1 C},\\\\, Because this filter is active, it may have non-unity passband gain. That is, high-frequency signals are inverted and amplified by R2/R1.  Discrete-time realization  Discrete-time high-pass filters can also be designed. Discrete-time filter design is beyond the scope of this article; however, a simple example comes from the conversion of the continuous-time high-pass filter above to a discrete-time realization. That is, the continuous-time behavior can be discretized. From the circuit in Figure 1 above, according to Kirchhoff's Laws and the definition of capacitance: :\\\\begin{cases} V_{\\\\text{out}}(t) = I(t)\\\\, R &\\\\text{(V)}\\\\\\\\\\\\ Q_c(t) = C \\\\, \\\\left( V_{\\\\text{in}}(t) - V_{\\\\text{out}}(t) \\\\right) &\\\\text{(Q)}\\\\\\\\\\\\ I(t) = \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d} Q_c}{\\\\operatorname{d} t} &\\\\text{(I)} \\\\end{cases} where Q_c(t) is the charge stored in the capacitor at time t. Substituting Equation (Q) into Equation (I) and then Equation (I) into Equation (V) gives: :V_{\\\\text{out}}(t) = \\\\overbrace{C \\\\, \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d} V_{\\\\text{in}}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t} - \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d} V_{\\\\text{out}}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t} \\\\right)}^{I(t)} \\\\, R = R C \\\\, \\\\left( \\\\frac{ \\\\operatorname{d} V_{\\\\text{in}}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t} - \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d} V_{\\\\text{out}}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t} \\\\right) This equation can be discretized. For simplicity, assume that samples of the input and output are taken at evenly spaced points in time separated by \\\\Delta_T time. Let the samples of V_{\\\\text{in}} be represented by the sequence (x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n), and let V_{\\\\text{out}} be represented by the sequence (y_1, y_2, \\\\ldots, y_n) which correspond to the same points in time. Making these substitutions: :y_i = R C \\\\, \\\\left( \\\\frac{x_i - x_{i-1}}{\\\\Delta_T} - \\\\frac{y_i - y_{i-1}}{\\\\Delta_T} \\\\right) And rearranging terms gives the recurrence relation :y_i = \\\\overbrace{\\\\frac{RC}{RC + \\\\Delta_T} y_{i-1}}^{\\\\text{Decaying contribution from prior inputs}} + \\\\overbrace{\\\\frac{RC}{RC + \\\\Delta_T} \\\\left( x_i - x_{i-1} \\\\right)}^{\\\\text{Contribution from change in input}} That is, this discrete-time implementation of a simple continuous-time RC high-pass filter is :y_i = \\\\alpha y_{i-1} + \\\\alpha (x_{i} - x_{i-1}) \\\\qquad \\\\text{where} \\\\qquad \\\\alpha \\\\triangleq \\\\frac{RC}{RC + \\\\Delta_T} By definition, 0 \\\\leq \\\\alpha \\\\leq 1. The expression for parameter \\\\alpha yields the equivalent time constant RC in terms of the sampling period \\\\Delta_T and \\\\alpha: :RC = \\\\Delta_T \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{1 - \\\\alpha} \\\\right). Recalling that :f_c=\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi RC} so RC=\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi f_c} then \\\\alpha and f_c are related by: :\\\\alpha = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi \\\\Delta_T f_c + 1} and :f_c=\\\\frac{1-\\\\alpha}{2\\\\pi \\\\alpha \\\\Delta_T}. If \\\\alpha = 0.5, then the RC time constant equal to the sampling period. If \\\\alpha \\\\ll 0.5, then RC is significantly smaller than the sampling interval, and RC \\\\approx \\\\alpha \\\\Delta_T.  Algorithmic implementation  The filter recurrence relation provides a way to determine the output samples in terms of the input samples and the preceding output. The following pseudocode algorithm will simulate the effect of a high-pass filter on a series of digital samples, assuming equally spaced samples: // Return RC high-pass filter output samples, given input samples, // time interval dt, and time constant RC function highpass(real[0..n] x, real dt, real RC) var real[0..n] y var real Œ± := RC / (RC + dt) y[0] := x[0] for i from 1 to n y[i] := Œ± √ó y[i‚àí1] + Œ± √ó (x[i] ‚àí x[i‚àí1]) return y The loop which calculates each of the n outputs can be refactored into the equivalent: for i from 1 to n y[i] := Œ± √ó (y[i‚àí1] + x[i] ‚àí x[i‚àí1]) However, the earlier form shows how the parameter Œ± changes the impact of the prior output \`y[i-1]\` and current change in input \`(x[i] - x[i-1])\`. In particular, * A large Œ± implies that the output will decay very slowly but will also be strongly influenced by even small changes in input. By the relationship between parameter Œ± and time constant RC above, a large Œ± corresponds to a large RC and therefore a low corner frequency of the filter. Hence, this case corresponds to a high-pass filter with a very narrow stop band. Because it is excited by small changes and tends to hold its prior output values for a long time, it can pass relatively low frequencies. However, a constant input (i.e., an input with \`(x[i] - x[i-1])=0\`) will always decay to zero, as would be expected with a high-pass filter with a large RC. * A small Œ± implies that the output will decay quickly and will require large changes in the input (i.e., \`(x[i] - x[i-1])\` is large) to cause the output to change much. By the relationship between parameter Œ± and time constant RC above, a small Œ± corresponds to a small RC and therefore a high corner frequency of the filter. Hence, this case corresponds to a high-pass filter with a very wide stop band. Because it requires large (i.e., fast) changes and tends to quickly forget its prior output values, it can only pass relatively high frequencies, as would be expected with a high-pass filter with a small RC. Applications Audio High-pass filters have many applications. They are used as part of an audio crossover to direct high frequencies to a tweeter while attenuating bass signals which could interfere with, or damage, the speaker. When such a filter is built into a loudspeaker cabinet it is normally a passive filter that also includes a low-pass filter for the woofer and so often employs both a capacitor and inductor (although very simple high-pass filters for tweeters can consist of a series capacitor and nothing else). As an example, the formula above, applied to a tweeter with R=10 Ohm, will determine the capacitor value for a cut-off frequency of 5 kHz. C = \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi f R} = \\\\frac{1}{6.28 \\\\times 5000 \\\\times 10} = 3.18 \\\\times 10^{-6} , or approx 3.2 ŒºF. An alternative, which provides good quality sound without inductors (which are prone to parasitic coupling, are expensive, and may have significant internal resistance) is to employ bi-amplification with active RC filters or active digital filters with separate power amplifiers for each loudspeaker. Such low-current and low-voltage line level crossovers are called active crossovers. Rumble filters are high-pass filters applied to the removal of unwanted sounds near to the lower end of the audible range or below. For example, noises (e.g., footsteps, or motor noises from record players and tape decks) may be removed because they are undesired or may overload the RIAA equalization circuit of the preamp. High-pass filters are also used for AC coupling at the inputs of many audio power amplifiers, for preventing the amplification of DC currents which may harm the amplifier, rob the amplifier of headroom, and generate waste heat at the loudspeakers voice coil. One amplifier, the professional audio model DC300 made by Crown International beginning in the 1960s, did not have high-pass filtering at all, and could be used to amplify the DC signal of a common 9-volt battery at the input to supply 18 volts DC in an emergency for mixing console power. However, that model's basic design has been superseded by newer designs such as the Crown Macro-Tech series developed in the late 1980s which included 10 Hz high- pass filtering on the inputs and switchable 35 Hz high-pass filtering on the outputs. Another example is the QSC Audio PLX amplifier series which includes an internal 5 Hz high-pass filter which is applied to the inputs whenever the optional 50 and 30 Hz high-pass filters are turned off. A 75 Hz \\"low cut\\" filter from an input channel of a Mackie 1402 mixing console as measured by Smaart software. This high-pass filter has a slope of 18 dB per octave. Mixing consoles often include high-pass filtering at each channel strip. Some models have fixed-slope, fixed-frequency high-pass filters at 80 or 100 Hz that can be engaged; other models have sweepable high-pass filters, filters of fixed slope that can be set within a specified frequency range, such as from 20 to 400 Hz on the Midas Heritage 3000, or 20 to 20,000 Hz on the Yamaha M7CL digital mixing console. Veteran systems engineer and live sound mixer Bruce Main recommends that high-pass filters be engaged for most mixer input sources, except for those such as kick drum, bass guitar and piano, sources which will have useful low frequency sounds. Main writes that DI unit inputs (as opposed to microphone inputs) do not need high-pass filtering as they are not subject to modulation by low-frequency stage wash‚Äîlow frequency sounds coming from the subwoofers or the public address system and wrapping around to the stage. Main indicates that high-pass filters are commonly used for directional microphones which have a proximity effect‚Äîa low-frequency boost for very close sources. This low frequency boost commonly causes problems up to 200 or 300 Hz, but Main notes that he has seen microphones that benefit from a 500 Hz high-pass filter setting on the console. Image Example of high-pass filter applied to the right half of a photograph. Left side is unmodified, Right side is with a high-pass filter applied (in this case, with a radius of 4.9) High-pass and low-pass filters are also used in digital image processing to perform image modifications, enhancements, noise reduction, etc., using designs done in either the spatial domain or the frequency domain. The unsharp masking, or sharpening, operation used in image editing software is a high-boost filter, a generalization of high-pass.

He is best remembered for his series of novels featuring the master criminal Dr. Fu Manchu.\\"Rohmer, Sax\\" by Jack Adrian in David Pringle, St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost & Gothic Writers. London: St. James Press, 1998; (pp. 482‚Äì484). Life and work Born in Birmingham to working-class Irish parents William Ward (c.1850 ‚Äì1932), a clerk, and Margaret Mary (n√©e Furey; c. 1850‚Äì1901),https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-39472 Arthur Ward initially pursued a career as a civil servant before concentrating on writing full-time. He worked as a poet, songwriter and comedy sketch writer for music hall performers before creating the Sax Rohmer persona and pursuing a career writing fiction. Like his contemporaries Algernon Blackwood and Arthur Machen, Rohmer claimed membership to one of the factions of the qabbalistic Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Leigh Blackmore \\"Hermetic Horrors: Weird Fiction Writers and the Order of the Golden Dawn\\" Rohmer also claimed ties to the Rosicrucians, but the validity of his claims has been questioned. His doctor and family friend Dr R. Watson Councell may have been his only legitimate connection to such organisations. His first published work was issued in 1903, when the short story \\"The Mysterious Mummy\\" was sold to Pearson's Weekly. Rohmer's main literary influences seem to have been Edgar Allan Poe, Arthur Conan Doyle and M.P. Shiel. He gradually transitioned from writing for music hall performers to concentrating on short stories and serials for magazine publication. In 1909 he married Rose Elizabeth Knox. He published his first book Pause! anonymously in 1910. In 1934 Sax Rohmer moved into a newly refurbished house, Little Gattonhttps://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/3816029 in Gatton Road, Reigate, Surrey, where he lived until 1946. The Fu Manchu series After penning Little Tich in 1911 (as ghostwriter for the music hall entertainer of the same name) he issued the first Fu Manchu novel, The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu, serialised from October 1912 to June 1913. It was an immediate success, with its fast-paced story of Denis Nayland Smith and Dr. Petrie facing the worldwide conspiracy of the \\"Yellow Peril\\". The Fu Manchu stories, together with his more conventional detective series characters‚ÄîPaul Harley, Gaston Max, Red Kerry, Morris Klaw (an occult detective), and the Crime Magnet‚Äîmade Rohmer one of the most successful and financially rewarded authors of the 1920s and 1930s. The first three Fu Manchu books were published in the four years between 1913‚Äì1917; but it was not until 1931 (some 14 years after the third book in the series) that Rohmer returned to the series with Daughter of Fu Manchu. The reason for the long interval was that Rohmer wanted to be rid of the series after The Si-Fan Mysteries. The first three books had been successfully filmed by Stoll in the twenties as a pair of serials. In 1928, Rohmer finally bowed to pressure and agreed to write a fourth novel as a serial for Collier's. Paramount had the first Warner Oland picture gearing up for production and the daily newspaper strip based on the series was in the offing. Rohmer's first effort at reviving the Fu Manchu property was ultimately reworked as The Emperor of America. The original intent had been for the head of the organisation to be Fu Manchu's daughter. He kept Head Centre as a female criminal mastermind to combat Drake Roscoe, but was very unhappy with the book both as it started and in its finished form. He would later return to Drake Roscoe and his female supervillain for the Sumuru series. In the meantime, he tried again to focus his energies on what was first titled Fu Manchu's Daughter for Collier's in 1930, but with an older (now knighted) Denis Nayland Smith as the protagonist once more. The results were infinitely better and jump-started the series in the process. In the 28 years from 1931 to 1959, Rohmer added a further 10 books to the Fu Manchu series, meaning the series totals 13 books in all (not counting the posthumous short story collection The Wrath of Fu Manchu and Other Stories). The Fu Manchu series drew much criticism from the Chinese government and Chinese communities in the U.S. for what was seen as negative ethnic stereotyping. Sociologist Virginia Berridge has stated that Rohmer created a false image of London's Chinese community as crime-ridden, further claiming that the Limehouse Chinese were one of the most law-abiding of London's ethnic minorities. Critic Jack Adrian has written: \\"Rohmer's own racism was careless and casual, a mere symptom of his times\\". Other work Rohmer became a friend of escapologist Harry Houdini, who wrote to him in praise of Rohmer's The Romance of Sorcery. Rohmer based his mystery-solving magician character Bazarada on Houdini. The Orchard of Tears is an odd book in the context of Sax Rohmer's other work. There are no Oriental villains or exotic locations; rather, there are gentle rabbits and lambs in pastoral settings and a great deal of philosophical musing. As much as he enjoyed Fu Manchu‚Äîand the notoriety and income the character provided‚ÄîRohmer had other interests and a markedly serious side. The departure from his expected subject matter is plainly signalled by the book's dedication: \\"To the slaves of the pomegranate, sons of Adam and daughters of Eve, who drink at the fountain of life, this chalice is offered as a loving-cup\\". In The Quest of the Sacred Slipper (1919) terror comes to Britain when a self-centered archaeologist unearths one of Islam's holiest relics‚Äîthe sacred slipper of the prophet Mohammed. Until it is returned to its rightful people, the implacable Hassan of Aleppo vows his reign of death and destruction shall not cease. Behind these inhuman outrages is a secret group of fanatics. Not even the best men of Scotland Yard seem able to apprehend them. Tales of Chinatown (1922) is a collection of 10 short stories published in hardcover by Cassell in 1922 and Doubleday, Page and Company in 1922. All of the stories first appeared in magazine format. This collection includes a story that is considered to be one of his best and also has been anthologised many times; \\"Tcheriapin\\". The story \\"The Hand of the Mandarin Quong\\" was rewritten for this book; first published as \\"Hand of the White Sheikh\\", Rohmer changed the setting to a Chinatown background and published it as \\"The Mystery of the Shriveled Hand\\"; the title was then changed again for this collection. Rohmer also wrote several novels of supernatural horror, including Brood of the Witch-Queen, described by Adrian as \\"Rohmer's masterpiece\\".L.D. Allen, \\"Sax Rohmer\\",in E. F. Bleiler, ed. Supernatural Fiction Writers. New York: Scribner's, 1985. pp. 555‚Äì560. Rohmer was very poor at managing his wealth, however, and made several disastrous business decisions that hampered him throughout his career. His final success came with a 1946-1946 BBC Light Programme radio series that led to a series of 1950s novels featuring a female variation on Fu Manchu, Sumuru. The Sumuru series consists of five books. Two films featuring the character played by Shirley Eaton were also produced by Harry Alan Towers as was a 2003 German film Sumuru. Rohmer also wrote numerous short stories; \\"The Master of Hollow Grange\\" (1920) is a homage to M. R. James' story \\"Lost Hearts\\", featuring a mad scientist who preys on children. Rohmer's work was banned in Nazi Germany, causing Rohmer to complain that he could not understand such censorship, stating \\"my stories are not inimical to Nazi ideals\\".Rod Stoneman, Far East Fu fighting: The Yellow Peril ‚Äì Dr Fu Manchu and the Rise of Chinophobia Review of The Yellow Peril: Dr. Fu Manchu and the Rise of Chinaphobia by Christopher Frayling.

He died in 1959 at the age of 76, due to an outbreak of \\"Asian flu\\". His wife, Rose Elizabeth (Knox) Ward (1886-1979), published her own mystery novel, Bianca in Black, in 1958 under the pen name Elizabeth Sax Rohmer.
