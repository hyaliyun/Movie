Protist 157(2):173-183 Life cycle The life cycle was determined in 1914. These parasites are heteroxenous, with two hosts in their life cycle. Sexual stages are found in the digestive tract of cephalopods and asexual stages infect the digestive tract of crustaceans. The parasites undergo merogony and gametogony in the digestive tract and sometimes in the other tissues of the cephalopod. The oocysts may be passed in the stool or form within the tissues of the cephalopod. When the oocysts are ingested by a crustacean - frequently a crab - they decyst and infect the digestive tract of the crustacean. The life cycle is completed when the crustacean is eaten by a cephalopod.

Half Ton class was an offshore sailing class of the International Offshore Rule racing the Half Ton Cup between 1967 and 1993.http://www.histoiredeshalfs.com/Half%20Ton%20Cup.htm History In order that yachts of different types can race against each other, there are handicap rules which are applied to differect boat designs. The Half Ton Class was created by the Offshore Racing Council for boats within the racing band not exceeding 22'-0\\". The ORC decided that the rule should \\"....permit the development of seaworthy offshore racing yachts...The Council will endeavour to protect the majority of the existing IOR fleet from rapid obsolescence caused by ....developments which produce increased performance without corresponding changes in ratings...\\" When first introduced the IOR rule was perfectly adequate for rating boats in existence at that time. However yacht designers naturally examined the rule to seize upon any advantage they could find, the most noticeable of which has been a reduction in displacement and a return to fractional rigs. After 1993, when the IOR Mk.III rule reached it termination due to lack of people building new boats, the rule was replaced by the CHS (Channel) Handicap system which in turn developed into the IRC system now used. The IRC handicap system operates by a secret formula which tries to develop boats which are 'Cruising type' of relatively heavy boats with good internal accommodation. It tends to penalise boats with excessive stability or excessive sail area. Competitions The most significant events for the Half Ton Class has been the annual Half Ton Cup which was sailed under the IOR rules until 1993. More recently this has been replaced with the Half Ton Classics Cup. The venue of the event moved from continent to continent with over-representation on French or British ports. In latter years the event is held Biannually. Initially it was proposed to hold events in Ireland, Britain and France by rotation. However it was the Belgians who took the ball and ran with it. The Class is now managed from Belgium. The next event will be held in Ireland for the second time in Kinsale, Co. Cork. Half Ton Cup The Half Ton class racing the Half Ton Cup between 1967 and 1993.http://www.histoiredeshalfs.com/Half%20Ton%20Cup.htm Half Ton Classics Cup The idea of holding a Half Ton Classics Cup first arose at Cork Week in 2000 when the Crew of 'Sibelius' (FRA) including Didier Dardot and his wife and the crew of 'SpACE Odyssey' (IRL) including Shay Moran, Enda Connellan, Terry Madigan and Vincent Delany agreed that it would be a great idea to organiser a bi-annual event for Half Tonners under the IRC handicap system with the venue rotating between France, England and Ireland. In fact Didier Dardot was unable to persuade La Trinite or any other French clubs to organise the first event. However the Half Ton enthusiasts of Nieupoort organised the first event in Belgium. personal recollections By 2017 it was evident that only expensively optimised boats were capable of winning the Half Ton Classics Cup. Without mentioning names- these boats were stripped down to the original hull, with new decks, deck hardware, keels, rigs and sails. Owners of boats which were not so rebuilt contented themselves with the status of the 'mid fleet club'. Thus numbers competing declined.  Criteria  Note 1.

American Pieta ‚Äì Carnegie Museum of Art Johnson also painted five murals at The Officer's Club at Fort Niagara State Park, which commemorate the history of the 28th regiment from its founding in 1905. Johnson won $1,000 in the Carnegie International Art contest of 1941. Because the Second World War was in full progress, the committee had been obliged to accept only the 5,000 American entries. Although some considered that the entries were poor, it was Johnson who was chosen as the winner. He had entered a painting called American Piet√†, which instead of showing the Virgin Mary cradling the crucified Jesus, showed an African American family group after it had just been given back the body of a lynched man. The painting was unapologetically anti-racist and documented the pain of the people involved, showing the grief and giving indications of the sadistic castrations that usually accompanied racial lynchings.

(\\"ITA\\") The facts Copthorne Holdings was part of a group of Canadian and non-resident companies controlled by Li Ka-Shing and his son Victor Li. It had purchased the Harbour Castle Hilton hotel in Toronto in 1981, and sold it for a substantial capital gain in 1989. The proceeds of the sale had been invested by Copthorne in Copthorne Overseas Investment Ltd. (\\"COIL\\"), a wholly owned Barbados company that carried on an active bond- trading business in Singapore. Another company in the Li Group, VHHC Holdings, held directly (and indirectly through its subsidiary VHSUB Holdings) shares in Husky Energy Inc.. By 1991, there was a substantial unrealized capital loss on that investment. In 1992, VHHC Holdings was sold to Copthorne, and VHHC Holdings subsequently sold the majority of its VHSUB shares to Copthorne (inheriting the high adjusted cost base under stop-loss rules) which in turn sold the VHSUB shares to an unrelated purchaser at their fair market value, and thus realized the capital loss. This allowed Copthorne to carry the capital loss on the VHSUB shares back to shelter the capital gains from the sale of the Harbour Castle Hotel. in 1993, Copthorne sold its holding in VHHC to its parent, thus making Copthorne and VHHC \\"sister\\" corporations. They, together with two other companies, were amalgamated and continued under the Copthorne name. In 1994, amendments to the Foreign Accrual Property Income (\\"FAPI\\") rules in the ITA, which would have made COIL‚Äôs income FAPI, encouraged the Li Group to dispose of the business of COIL to another entity within the Li Group and to remove some or all of the proceeds of disposition from Canada. This was effected by a series of transactions that (in summary) involved the transfer of the shares of Copthorne and another related company to a new offshore company in the group, and redeeming certain shares of the company through a tax-free reduction of paid-up capital. The Minister of National Revenue applied GAAR to recharacterize this payment as a deemed dividend, and thus subject to a 15% non-resident withholding tax plus related penalty. The judgments below At the Tax Court of Canada, Campbell J. found that all elements necessary to apply the GAAR had been established: a series of transactions, a tax benefit, an avoidance transaction, and the abusiveness of the transaction. This ruling was affirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal, but Ryer J.A. noted that the Tax Court judge had applied too stringent a legal test to assessing the series of transactions. He concluded that a \\"strong nexus\\" need not exist between a series and a related transaction to find that the related transaction is part of the series. Instead, the series need only be a \\"motivating factor\\" for the related transaction (para. 49). Given the Tax Court judge‚Äôs finding that a strong nexus existed, he concluded that this less stringent motivating factor test was clearly met. He also upheld the conclusion of the Tax Court judge that the avoidance transaction had been abusive, but differed in his application of the GAAR. Decision of the Supreme Court of Canada The decision of the Federal Court of Appeal was affirmed unanimously by the Court, together with clarification as to the proper analysis and application intended for GAAR. GAAR is a provision of last resort, and, before being applied to deny a tax benefit, a Court must conduct an objective, thorough and step-by-step analysis. After concisely summarizing the facts and his analysis on the existence of a tax benefit and an avoidance transaction, Justice Rothstein focused on the question whether there was an abusive transaction. The majority of his lengthy reasons provide a template for the type of detailed analysis that is expected in a GAAR appeal. In order to determine whether a transaction is an abuse or misuse of the Act, a court must first determine the object, spirit or purpose of the provisions that are relied on for the tax benefit, having regard to the scheme of the Act, the relevant provisions and permissible extrinsic aids. While an avoidance transaction may operate alone to produce a tax benefit, it may also operate as part of a series of transactions that results in the tax benefit. While the focus must be on the transaction, where it is part of a series, it must be viewed in the context of the series to enable the court to determine whether abusive tax avoidance has occurred. In such a case, whether a transaction is abusive will only become apparent when it is considered in the context of the series of which it is a part and the overall result that is achieved. The analysis will lead to a finding of abusive tax avoidance: * where the transaction achieves an outcome the statutory provision was intended to prevent; * where the transaction defeats the underlying rationale of the provision; or * where the transaction circumvents the provision in a manner that frustrates or defeats its object, spirit or purpose. These considerations are not independent of one another and may overlap. Significance Following on the Court's previous rulings in 2005 in Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada,Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada, 2005 SCC 54, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 601 and in 2009 in Lipson v. Canada,Lipson v. Canada, 2009 SCC 1, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 3 GAAR has a firm basis in the application of Canadian income tax law in the analysis of abusive tax transactions. There is, however, debate as to whether this decision will lead to predictability and consistency in GAAR analysis. Copthorne also imported into Canadian tax jurisprudence the SCC's framework for reversing its own decisions, as noted by Rothstein J.: There is debate as to whether Canada Trustco was more in the nature of dicta, whereas Fraser dealt with the reversal of ratio decidendi. The Court also emphasizes the importance in tax planning of going beyond the mechanical application of particular provisions of the Act as if it were a mere instruction manual or limited book of rules.

According to the mission statement on their website, New Grounds is \\"dedicated to providing artists with a professional, informative, safer and well-equipped environment for the creation of fine prints while promoting the artists and exhibiting their work.\\"  Origins and goals  New Grounds was founded in response to three particular needs: #The need for a printmaking center in Albuquerque offering classes, press and studio access to all artists working in intaglio and relief printmaking. #The need to educate the general public about printmaking by offering studio tours, lectures and exhibitions. #The need for this facility to be nontoxic. At that time all printmaking constituted a high health risk to artists in addition to having a negative impact on the environment. A good definition of nontoxic, or green printmaking, can be found on Friedhard Kiekeben's website, NontoxicPrint.com: \\"the term nontoxic/non-toxic has become synonymous with safety-conscious practice. Nontoxic processes still use a variety of chemicals, and the ultimate safety of any material and process is dependent on their informed use.\\" New Grounds utilized the research of the innovators Keith Howard and Mark Zaffron to build a completely green studio, and, according to a research paper written by Liz Chalfin from Zea Mays Printmaking studio, New Grounds was one of the first nontoxic printmaking studios in the United States.

A touring orator who delivered as many as 200 lectures per year, Berkey is best remembered for his 1896 campaign for Governor of Wisconsin heading the ticket of that state's Prohibition Party, in which he finished third to the candidates of the Republican and Democratic parties. Biography Early years Joshua Hernandez Berkey was born March 11, 1852, in the rural hamlet of Post Oak Springs, Roane County, Tennessee.Commemorative Biographical Record of the Counties of Rock, Green, Grant, Iowa, and Lafayette, Wisconsin, Containing Biographical Sketches of Prominent and Representative Citizens, and of Many of the Early Settled Families. Chicago: J.H. Beers and Co., 1901; pp. 694-695. His father, Jacob W. Berkey, hailed from the state of Indiana, while his mother, the former Mary R. Moore, was a Tennessee native. Together, his parents raised three sons, moving to Wisconsin in 1860. His father, of ethnic Dutch descent, was a showman toured extensively throughout the United States during his life, frequently taking Joshua on the road with him until his death in 1871 at the age of 47. Berkey settled in Monroe, Wisconsin, the county seat of Green County, located near the state's southern border. There he married Sarah M. Sears in the fall of 1875. Together the couple raised six children. Berkey initially studied to become a pharmacist, opening a drug store in the neighboring town of Monticello shortly after his marriage. During the several years in which he was in business, Berkey became interested in the growing political movement calling for the restriction or prohibition of alcohol. He was consumed by this issue for the rest of his life. In 1880, Berkey sold his drug store and moved west with his family to the booming city of Denver, Colorado, where he took a position as a secretary for a mining company. He soon turned his attention to journalism, however, taking a position as business manager of a weekly Denver newspaper called The Great West before leaving to launch his own publication, a humorous literary weekly newspaper called Hello. Berkey liquidated his assets in Denver in 1883 and moved to the midwestern state of Kansas, where he purchased a farm in Sumner County. He remained there until 1891, starting a temperance newspaper called \\"The Crank\\" in Geuda Springs, Kansas, which was a widely circulated paper. It was as publisher of this newspaper that Berkey became a figure of national standing in the American prohibition movement. Political career Berkey's anti-alcohol newspaper drew attention across the state of Kansas and he began traveling the region as a lecturer on temperance and other related political themes. He became a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church during the early 1890s. In 1896, Berkey was the candidate of the Prohibition Party for Governor of Wisconsin.\\"Joshua H. Berkey,\\" Our Campaigns.com, www.ourcampaigns.com/ He finished third, behind Edward Scofield and Willis C. Silverthorn. Berkey entered the ministry in 1898, returning to Monroe, Wisconsin, to take to the pulpit of the Congregationalist Christian Church there. In 1902, Berkey was an unsuccessful candidate for the Wisconsin State Assembly.Lawrence Kestenbaum (ed.), \\"Joshua H. Berkey,\\" Political Graveyard.com, www.politicalgraveyard.com/ Berkey also stood for election as the Prohibition Party's nominee for United States House of Representatives in Wisconsin First District in the election of 1908.\\"Papers Filed by Candidates: Secretary of State's Office Receives Signed Calls of the Politicians,\\" Green Bay Gazette, vol. 35 (Aug. 3, 1908), pg. 1.

In order to qualify for the bona fide residence test, an individual needs to reside in a foreign country for an uninterrupted period that includes an entire tax year. In addition, the bona fide residence test takes into account factors such as the individual's intention, the purpose of the trip, and the length and nature of the stay. There are special deductions and exclusions that accompany this only if the individual is a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien and has a tax treaty. The bona fide residence is not always the same as the domicile. The domicile is defined as one's permanent home.  Example  Mike moves to South Africa for work and expects to be there for an indefinite or extended period. Mike has a residence in South Africa for an entire year; his home is still in New York City, and he intends to return here after his stay in South Africa. Even though Mike is a bona fide resident of South Africa, his domicile is the United States, but he probably will qualify for FEIE, because his stay was more than a year, and for an indefinite period.This is not all that is needed to determine the FEIE. For more, see: IRS - Bona Fide Residence Test The IRS largely determines your tax status based on form 2555.  Statement to foreign authorities  The individual is not considered a real resident of a foreign country if at any time the individual makes a statement that s/he is not a resident of that country; and the authorities decide that the individual is not subject to their income tax laws. Also, if the government of the foreign country is currently deciding on the individual's status, the individual is not considered a real resident at that point.  Special agreements and treaties  A tax treaty will not in and of itself exempt a person from being considered a citizen of another country. However, some general rules apply. U.S. armed forces stationed abroad including civilian component of armed service will almost never be able to become bona fide residents while employed on duty in a foreign country.  Uninterrupted period including entire tax year  To pass the bona fide residency test, the individual needs to reside within a foreign country for an entire tax year, defined as January 1 through December 31. The individual is allowed to leave this country for brief trips back to the U.S, or somewhere else for either vacation or business. However, the individual needs to have a ‚Äúclear intention‚Äù of returning to the country from the trips. The individual's bona fide residence can include an entire tax year and parts of two other tax years. If the individual is reassigned for employment reasons, the individual is sometimes allowed a break between foreign residencies, but this depends on the circumstances. The individual may meet the ‚Äúphysical presence test‚Äù or qualify for foreign income exemptions even if s/he doesn't qualify as a bona fide foreign resident.

Personal Tall grew up in Bamako, Mali, from birth to age 7 when his father, Maki Tall, became Ambassador of Mali to Saudi Arabia. At this time Tidiani (Jeff) Tall was sent to boarding school in France. Shortly thereafter the Tall family moved to Washington, DC and Tidiani studied at the French International School in Bethesda, Maryland. It is here that he gained a taste for American football and has since been a Washington Redskins fan. His time in the United States saw Tall meet Jimmy Carter and attend events such as Ronald Reagan's annual Christmas party before the age of 12. In 1982, the Tall family moved back to Mali where Tidiani studied in Bamako at the French International School and subsequently, in 1985, attended the Prytan√©e National Militaire cadet school in La Fl√®che, department of La Sarthe, France. In 1990, Tall was admitted to the elite Ecole Polytechnique of Paris where he stayed for three years before studying for one year at the French Petroleum Institute, also in Paris. Tall now holds a Masters in Economics & Management from the French Petroleum Institute in Paris, France and a Masters in Engineering in Applied Mathematics from Ecole Polytechnique also in Paris, France. From this upbringing Tall began a professional career as described below. Tall currently travels the world but splits the majority of his time between Paris, France, and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Professional In 1994, Tidiani (Jeff) Tall was hired to join the Analyst program in the Fixed Income division at Morgan Stanley in London as 1 of 10 high potential graduates from across Europe. After 18 months at Morgan Stanley, driven by a desire to contribute to his native home of Mali through entrepreneurial endeavours, Tall returned to Mali to create and run a road transport company in the landlocked nation. Timbuktu Trading & Transport (\\"3T\\") became the first trucking company in Mali that met international standards in safety and employment practices. Subsequent to running 3T for three years, Tall moved on to found a dotcom startup based in New York City called eSpirituality. The website became the first major portal for personal development and alternative medicine and won acclaim from New Age magazine, was named a Yahoo site of the day and was featured on MSN. Of memorable note was an interactive dream analysis section held by the resident \\"Dr. Dream\\". At the end of 2000, eSpirituality became a casualty of the dot-com bubble. In January 2001, Tall began another extended foray into professional services first by joining Roland Berger Strategy Consultants, a top European strategy consulting firm, to work in their Paris and New York offices as a Senior Consultant. Two years later Tall left to co- found a New York-based consulting boutique called Expansion USA. Expansion USA developed a reputation by assisting European companies and institutions establish or expand their presence in the united States marketplace. Four years henceforth Tall moved to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates and created a marketing and communications agency called A+ Marketing. His experience to this point had seen Tall work with large international organizations including ExxonMobil, Total, Shell, MasterCard, Lycos and Daimler Chrysler among many others operating in all corners of the globe. In April 2010, Tall joined Lafarge, a global leader in building materials, as Vice President Supply Chain & Distribution, Sub-Saharan Africa where he works to develop the commercial capabilities of ten business units in ten countries. Tall is also a member of the African Leadership Network and of Africa 2.0. Family History Tall is the great-great grandson of West African Emperor Umar Tall and the great grandson of West African King Agibu Tall. Stretching across much of what is now Senegal, Guinea and Mali, they were leaders of the Tukulor empire in the nineteenth century. Tall's father, Maki Tall, served as the Ambassador of Mali to Saudi Arabia and subsequently as the Ambassador to the United States which required moving his family to Washington, DC. This post afforded Tidiani (Jeff) Tall, at a young age, the opportunity to meet President Jimmy Carter and attend White House events such as Ronald and Nancy Reagan's annual Christmas party to which his father and family were invited. Moving back to Mali, Maki Tall became the Director of International Cooperation at the ministry of Foreign Affairs in Bamako. He later served as Ambassador of Mali to Germany and to the United Arab Emirates. Maki Tall is currently the traditional ruler of Bandiagara in Mali. Fixing Africa: Once and for all Fixing Africa: Once and for all is a progressive work focused on improving Africa and moving it forward from the hardships that have plagued the continent's past. A child of Pan-Africanism, the premise surrounds a conglomeration of Africa's 54 countries currently represented into 3 \\"Super Federations\\" by the year 2030. The published book and E-bookhttp://www.tjtall.com Downloads available in four languages delve into failed movements of the past and the factors that prevented them from becoming realities, influential examples of successful movements outside of Africa, the need for understanding and knowledge coupled with a willingness for real and practical change along with several pragmatic examples of what this change might look like. As Tall describes the hope for change lies within and must be \\"led by the youth and enabled by [effective use of] information technology.\\" Fixing Africa: Once and for All is available in print or as an E-book and has been made available in English, French, Arabic and Chinese. Inspiration Tall's inspiration for Fixing Africa came from the hypocrisy of 2007-2010's 50th anniversary celebration of Independence in many African nations. Multimillion-dollar celebrations were occurring despite decades of lost progress and a population largely living in misery and humiliation. Tall's goal is to inform a new generation of Africans and set high expectations within them to ensure that, \\"with the ascension of a new breed of leaders might Africa‚Äôs people be delivered out of poverty, diseases, wars, famine, economic meltdown, political paralysis, and 360-degree insecurity.\\"http://fixingafrica.com/download.php Key Messages Summarized, Fixing Africa is based on three ideals: * All 54 African countries are struggling. The denial must end so the recovery can start. * Individually African men and women have shown that they can perform at a global level in any field, anytime and anywhere. * New ideas and bold actions are required to translate individual achievements into collective progress. Alternative Viewpoints Dambisa Moyo, author and economist, discusses the counterintuitive negative impact associated with African Aid in the book Dead Aid. Moyo \\"describes the state of postwar development policy in Africa today and unflinchingly confronts one of the greatest myths of our time: that billions of dollars in aid sent from wealthy countries to developing African nations has helped to reduce poverty and increase growth.\\" Martin Meredith, historian and journalist, provides a controversial Western viewpoint on fifty years of African independence, and the many failures that have accompanied it, in the book The Fate of Africa: A History of Fifty Years of Independence.

In 1971 they were designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for their breeding seabird colonies and they are permanently closed to landings from boat passengers. The vegetation on the islands is limited by the extreme exposure and only six species of flowering plants have been recorded.  Nature reserve  The islands are largely managed as nature reserves by the Isles of Scilly Wildlife Trust, principally for breeding seabirds and grey seals (Halichoerus grypus). The only breeding sites for European Storm‚Äìpetrel in England are on the Isles of Scilly with eleven colonies and an estimated 1475 occupied sites (i.e. breeding pairs). There are only three small breeding colonies on the Norrard Rocks; Mincarlo, Illiswilgig and Castle Bryher with a total of 37 pairs. Other seabirds breeding within the SSSI are Fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis), Guillemot (Uria aalge), Lesser Black‚Äìbacked Gull (Larus fuscus) and Herring Gull (L argentatus). The rove beetle (Omalium allardi) has been recorded on several of the islands.  Individual islands and rocks  The islands and rocks are listed below in decreasing order of area.  Gweal  (, place of trees) () and high. Gweal is a small rocky island consisting of two hills linked by a boulder beach, just off the west coast of Bryher and is an occasional pupping site for grey seal. Plants recorded are sea beet (Beta vulgaris subsp. maritima), rock sea‚Äìspurry (Spergularia rupicola), common scurvygrass (Cochlearia officinalis), thrift (Armeria maritima) and tree mallow (Lavatera arborea).  Scilly Rock  () Scilly Rock is just over west of Bryher is a large rock, divided by a deep chasm into two parts with a maximum height of . Each part has a summit named North Cuckoo and South Cuckoo. Landing is difficult and only possible in calm conditions. It is reputedly the island from which the rest of the archipelago gets its name although there is no evidence or explanation for this. Puffin (Fratercula arctica) breed and the only plants recorded are rock sea-spurrey and oraches (Atriplex) species.  Mincarlo  (, rayfish stone) () Mincarlo is the southernmost of the group west of Samson. Several species nest on the island including the largest breeding colony of Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) in the Isles of Scilly as well as Puffin, Great Black‚Äìbacked Gull (Larus marinus), Razorbill (Alca torda) and Common Shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis). The breeding colony of European Storm‚Äìpetrel (Hydrobates pelagicus) occupied 17 sites during the Seabird 2000 survey. Tree mallow, orache, common scurveygrass, rock sea‚Äìspurrey and sea beet have all been recorded. The rocks are a main pupping site for grey seal (Halichoerus grypus). The Arachnologist, W S Bristow visited the Isles of Scilly in 1928, 1929 and 1934 and landed on many of the uninhabited islands. On Mincarlo he recorded the following spiders; Trochosa terricola, Oedothorax fuscus, Lepthyphantes tenuis, Dismodicus bifrons, Xysticus kochi and Halorates reprobus which is associated with the nests of seabirds, especially cormorant and shag.  Illiswilgig  (, grassy island) () Several species have bred on Illiswilgig, including a small colony of only three pairs of European Storm‚Äìpetrel, recorded during the Seascape 2000 survey. Plants recorded are tree mallow, thrift, sea beet, rock sea‚Äìspurrey, common scurvy grass, orache and English stonecrop (Sedum anglicum). Illiswilgig is a main pupping and haul‚Äìout site for grey seal.  Maiden Bower  (, great stones) () Only a few gulls breed on Maiden Bower and no plants have been recorded.  Castle Bryher  (, Bryher's castle)() and The Seabird 2000 survey recorded 17 occupied sites of European Storm‚Äìpetrel. Puffin and gulls also breed on the island and plants recorded are tree mallow, sea beet, rock sea-spurrey, common scurvygrass and orache.  Seal Rock  () An important breeding and haul out site for grey seal and orache is the only plant recorded.

The game was released for the Atari 8-bit family and Commodore 64. The player acts as the ruler of a \\"weyr,\\" a mountaintop redoubt where the people of the planet Pern raise dragons in order to protect against periodic invasions of deadly \\"thread\\" that falls from a nearby planet. The game is primarily a strategic one, in which the user attempts to form alliances, but it also includes an action portion where the player controls a dragon in an attempt to destroy falling thread. The game was considered a forerunner of similar games based on novels. A sequel for the Commodore 64, Moreta: Dragonlady of Pern, was cancelled and not completed. Plot In the novels, the world of Pern is in a semi-feudal state of development. The majority of the population belongs to one of many Holds, which are similar to principalities or duchies. Pern is at the mercy of the Thread, a deadly microorganism native to another planet in the Pern solar system. When the two planets periodically approach each other in orbit every few hundred years, the organisms form into long strings of thread that cross the gap through space. The Weyrs are dedicated to the raising and training of dragons, whose fiery breath is the only effective weapon against the Thread. Only the combined forces of many Weyrs could hope to deal with the Thread on a global basis, but internecine political battles between the Holds, Weyrs, and powerful Guilds prevent any sort of global response. The first book, Dragonflight, is primarily focused on the efforts of Benden Weyr's new dragon master to form an alliance to fight the soon-to-arrive Thread. It has been hundreds of years since the last approach of the two planets, and the planet is ill-prepared for its return. Gameplay Action during a thread fight. The dragon is in the upper right corner of the screen in the frontmost of three \\"depths.\\" Thread is falling on two of these depths; the larger Threads (like those lower on the screen) at the front, and smaller Threads (examples at the top) in the middle depth. Like the books, Dragonriders focuses on the strategic need to form alliances between the Holds, Weyrs, and Guilds. It also includes periodic action sequences in which the player has to fight the Thread directly. The game is divided into turns, each representing one 240-day year. The player can select any game length from 1 to 99 turns when the game is being set up. Game setup also allows the player to select the speed of the turns from two to seven minutes, so games might stretch into hours. The player is offered a chance to save the game to disk at the end of every turn. The game could also be played by between one and four players on the Atari, and one or two players on the C64, each using separate joysticks. The Commodore 64 could have up to 4 players if the paddle (game controller) and keyboard were used. During each turn, the user is initially presented with a screen showing ongoing negotiations between the various factions in the game, as the date continues to increase in real time. At any time, the player can decide to start negotiations of his own, which may be the formation of an alliance, or a more mundane attempt to influence future negotiations through invitations to a wedding or hatching. Watching the ongoing negotiations between the computer- controlled Holds is important, as it often provides clues to the next Holds to contact. While negotiations are taking place, a map of Pern periodically appears, highlighting a Hold where Thread is falling. Any of the Weyrs can choose to send dragons to fight the Thread, and how many to send. The outcome of these battles has a major influence on the Weyr's perception among the Holds, so sending dragons to allies, or potential allies, has a major outcome during the next turn. When the turn ends, these commands are played out. If the player has chosen to send dragons to a Hold, this launches an action sequence, with the player controlling one of the Dragonriders, maneuvering the dragon and firing its breath to destroy the Thread falling from the top of the screen. Thread that touches the dragon injures and eventually kills it, and the player attempts to survive to the end of the sequence with the number of dragons he decided to send. One twist to the action sequence was the inclusion of a 3-D capability known as \\"depths.\\" Each \\"depth\\" was a separate 2-D side- view play field on which the Thread was falling, stacked onscreen, and indicated by scaling the size of the Thread and dragon. Selecting one depth produced a simple 2-D playfield, but this could be increased up to three, allowing the user to move \\"into\\" the screen among the layers. Adding layers made the gameplay more complex, but spread the Thread across the layers, and thereby provided more room to maneuver. The game is score-based, with points being awarded for successful negotiations and alliances. Games end when the pre-selected number of turns expire, a certain number of points are reached, or a certain number of Holds become Thread-infested. Development Dragonriders was developed during a key period of the development of Epyx, what amounted to a \\"battle for the creative vision of Epyx.\\" Originally formed as Automated Simulations in 1978 as a partnership between Jim Connelley and Jon Freeman, the company had initially concentrated on wargame titles like Starfleet Orion. The release of the famed Temple of Apshai in 1979 took the company away from its hardcore market into a more action-oriented space. Concerned about brand dilution, the company introduced the Epyx brand to cover these titles. As these were very successful, the Epyx brand became more widely used than its parent company's name. By 1982 the company had grown very large and Freeman left to work on his own (forming Free Fall Associates). Although Connelley was ostensibly in control of the company, in effect he had removed himself from the day-to-day operations to focus on development. This led to the formation of an internal development team under his direction, known as \\"The Connelley Group\\". During this period, the company continued moving its focus from simulations and wargames to action titles. By 1983 the company's management was focusing on the Epyx brand, and changed the name of the company to match. Dragonriders was one of the last games designed to the original vision of the thinking man's game company. Although Dragonriders garnered critical praise, its release was overshadowed by the pure-action game Jumpman, a huge success. Connelley left with his team soon after, and this was his last game at Epyx. A board game based on the same basic premise was also released in 1983 by Mayfair Games. Like the Epyx game, the board game concentrated on the diplomatic efforts of one to seven players, with the same basic victory conditions. Unlike the Epyx version, there was no action sequence.\\"Dragonriders of Pern\\", Board Game Geek The parallels between the gameplay dynamics of the two games are striking, but existing sources do not record whether or not this was due to a collaborative effort. Reception Pern received mixed reviews when it arrived. Compute! granted it a lengthy review, calling it \\"offbeat\\" and suggesting it to players looking for something different than \\"shooting up the same retreaded space ships\\" or typing \\"look under rock\\". Computer Gaming World was even more hesitant, suggesting that those looking for action would be better off elsewhere, while those looking for complex strategy would find the game would \\"appeal to you\\". In a 1992 survey of science fiction games the magazine gave the title two stars out of five, stating that \\"It offers some interesting features, but it is dated and primitive\\" and mentioning DragonStrike as a superior clone.

Biography  Alicia Le Fanu was the daughter of Betsy Sheridan and Captain Henry Le Fanu, and a granddaughter of actor Thomas Sheridan and his wife, writer Frances Sheridan. She had a younger sister, Harriet. The family moved from Dublin to Kingsbridge, Devon in the 1790s, and later Bath, from where her mother wrote letters mentioning Le Fanu's emerging literary talents, she considered her daughter's talent for writing to be \\"much superior\\" to her own. Her mother encouraged her writing, and ensured that the family library held books that would interest and educate Le Fanu. She began her publishing career in 1809. Le Fanu moved to Leamington Spa around 1822 with her mother, following the deaths of her father and sister. The exact date of her death is generally stated to be unknownRicorso and has been asserted as early as 29 January 1826, but is usually stated to have been in or after 1844. She is known to have been alive in 1844, when she received ¬£150 from the Royal Bounty Fund, secured on her behalf by her cousin, Caroline Norton. However, Fitzer has determined that she died from a subdural effusion on 29 January 1867, while boarding with a family in Chipping Norton. Le Fanu's poems are moralistic fables, while her historical romances are melodramas, with some satire and elements of comedy. The 1824 Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Mrs Frances Sheridan was an account of her grandmother's life but it is accepted that it contains a number of unsubstantiated facts.

The son of a German father and a Jewish mother, he was born in St. Pauli, the poorest part of Hamburg. Despite being Jewish, Sch√ºnzel was allowed by the Nazis to continue making films for several years until he eventually left to live abroad.  Life in Germany Reinhold Sch√ºnzel (or Schuenzel) started his career as an actor in 1915 with a role in the film Werner Krafft. He directed his first film in 1918 Mary Magdalene and in 1920 directed The Girl from Acker Street and Catherine the Great. He was one of Germany's best-known silent film stars after World War I, a period in which films were very influenced by the consequences of the war. Sch√ºnzel performed roles in both comedies and dramas, often appearing as a villain or a powerful and corrupt man. He was influenced by filmmakers such as his mentor Richard Oswald and Ernst Lubitsch, for whom he worked as an actor in the film Madame Du Barry in 1919. Sch√ºnzel's work was very popular in Germany and the Nazi regime gave him the title of Ehrenarier or Honorary Aryan, allowing him to continue to direct and act despite his Jewish heritage (his mother was Jewish). He found that the government, first under Kaiser Wilhelm II and later under Adolf Hitler, interfered with his film projects, impelling him to leave 1937. Schuenzel described both the Kaiser and Hitler \\"persons of recognized authority and the worst possible dramatic taste.\\" Moving to the United States, he worked in Hollywood, playing Nazis and scientists. One of many examples was the film The Hitler Gang (1944), directed by John Farrow. This film and was about the rise of Hitler from a small political adventurer to the dictator of Germany showed in the way of a gangster film and here Reinhold Sch√ºnzel played the role of General Erich Ludendorff. Family Sch√ºnzel had a daughter Marianne Stewart, who was born in Berlin, Germany and followed her father by becoming an actress. She appeared in Broadway plays and she was known for The Facts of Life (1960), Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964), and Time Table (1956). Sch√ºnzel in the United States Sch√ºnzel went to the United States in the thirties. He began his American career in Hollywood in 1937 at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Among the films he directed were Rich Man, Poor Girl (1938), Ice Follies (1939), Balalaika (1939), and New Wine (1941). He also acted in films like The vicious cycle, Hitler's Gang and Dragonwyck among others. Sch√ºnzel went to New York in 1945 to make a debut on Broadway, although he was familiar to New Yorker audiences after he directed and appeared with the Swiss-born German/Austrian actor Emil Jannings in a film called Fortune's Fool, which was released in New York in 1928. Also on Broadway he acted in Temper the Wind in 1946 and Montserrat in 1949. His most memorable performance was as Dr. Anderson, a Nazi conspirator, in the film Notorious in 1946. Among the prizes he received was the Federal West German Film prize for the best supporting role in the movie My Father's Horses. He became a U.S citizen in 1943 and he returned to Germany in 1949.ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851-2010) Pg. 27 Sch√ºnzel died of a heart attack in Munich, Germany. Before rturning to Germany, he starred in the 1949 Clifford Odets Broadway play The Big Knife.

He used this money to travel to London to give evidence at the trial of Archbishop of Armagh, Oliver Plunkett, with his cousin, Friar John MacMoyer. Florence MacMoyer was imprisoned for some time after his return to Ireland, and was unable to reclaim the Book of Armagh. He died in 1713 and was buried in Ballymoyer Old Graveyard.

History In 1995, the commission was set up by Robert Dole and Newt Gingrich to study ways to encourage economic growth. After Dole and Gingrich chose Kemp as chairman, each appointed four additional members to the commission. During January 1996, the Kemp Commission reported on overhauling the tax system. Proposal The commission concluded that \\"a flat rate tax would not only be a fairer system for middle-income Americans but also would abolish income taxes for relatively poor people by providing for a generous personal exemption.\\" The Kemp Commission laid out 6 \\"points of policy\\" in its proposal: * A single tax rate * Large personal and dependent exemptions to remove lower-income people from the tax rolls * Lower tax rates for families * Allowing workers to deduct Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes * Ending taxation of interest, dividends and capital gains * Requiring a two-thirds majority in Congress to raise the tax rate. Response William G. Gale wrote in a response for the Brookings Institution that \\"the report is symptomatic of the whole debate on tax reform: there is widespread agreement on the principles of tax reform, much less agreement on what those principles mean in practice, and perhaps very little on how to trade off one principle against another. But the revenue estimates provided above suggest that all of the stated goals of the commission cannot be achieved simultaneously: choices will have to be made between desirable features of the rate structure, the tax base, and extent and direction of social policy.\\" Accounting firm, Coopers & Lybrand, concluded \\"that a flat tax offering exemptions for homeownership, charitable contributions, investments, payroll taxes and other priorities favored by the panel would require a rate of at least 25 percent to keep from adding to the deficit.\\" See also * Tax reform References External links * Kemp Commission: Damn the Deficit, Full Speed Backwards by Citizens for Tax Justice Tax reform in the United States ","title":"Kemp Commission"},{"id":"34139654","text":"The Itabaca Channel separates the islands of Baltra and Santa Cruz in the Gal√°pagos archipielago in Ecuador.

He became an overnight sensation by racking up an impressive string of 16 straight knockout victories. Arnold's style was similar to Sugar Ray Robinson; he was a slick boxer with lightning-fast combinations, and a knockout punch. The Ring Magazine and various newspapers across the United States touted Arnold as the next Joe Louis or Sugar Ray Robinson. Arnold was a heavy favorite to defeat Rocky Graziano, and then to go on to fight for the world title. In a brutal battle staged in March 1945, Arnold battered the rough and tough Graziano for the first few rounds. It seemed only a matter of moments when the fight would be stopped. However, Graziano absorbed the beating and went on to batter and knockout Arnold in one of the major upsets in boxing.

They have neither the authority nor the resources to care for thousands of other sites honoring Americans worldwide. American War Memorials Overseas has the following objectives regarding these other sites: *Record the existence and location of non-government supported war memorials honoring Americans overseas and make this information available to the public. *Encourage cultural tourism to visit these historical sites. *Encourage and facilitate local communities to fly the American flag over private war memorials honoring Americans. *Monitor the condition of these war memorials, and encourage their conservation. *Provide expert advice to those involved in war memorial projects, and facilitate maintenance projects for sponsoring organizations. *Work with communities and organizations to encourage local responsibility for war memorials, and to recognize the need to conduct restoration work on these monuments as required. *Build a greater understanding of war memorial heritage and raise awareness of the issues surrounding war memorial conservation. These objectives are published in the Army Magazine. The American War Memorials Overseas lasting goal is not only to have documented all war memorials that honor Americans in countries outside the United States, but most importantly, to preserve those memorials so that they will last forever. The AWMO cooperates with other organizations, at international, national, and local levels, to fix memorials that are in disrepair and to safeguard the future of such memorials. Documentation Thousands of American war memorials exist throughout the world. An American war memorial overseas is any permanent object put in place in an overseas location to commemorate Americans involved in or affected by a conflict or war in that area.Kelly Lanigan, May 2009, \\"Overseas War Memorials: 'Beacon for the Future'\\", VFW, 20-22 These war memorials can be put in place by military units or veterans organizations to remember their fallen compatriots. They can be erected by family members to commemorate their loved ones or mark the spot where they fell. They can be installed by local organizations to recall the historical events in the area or as appreciation to their liberators. They can be constructed by the host nation as an official appreciation of the contributions of the United States of America and her citizens.\\" In most cases, neither the United States government nor local governments have the responsibility or the resources to document and maintain these sites. Many of these have been forgotten over time and their existence lost in the memory of former generations. The AWMO has been documenting and compiling an online database to search for such memorials. These include isolated burial sites of American combatants, monuments, and museums. Over one thousand American war dead lie in churchyards, foreign cemeteries, or in the fields where they fell in overseas locations throughout the world. Often these gravesites are unmaintained and undocumented. The AWMO works to locate, document, and preserve these scattered burials. At almost every location where Americans have fought overseas, in addition to the 25 federal monuments, many non- federal monuments commemorate their sacrifice. These sites are often little- known and poorly maintained. There are also simple markers and plaques which document the location of specific American actions on every European battlefield. These locations include the limits of advance of American combat divisions, the crash site where an American aircraft went down, or the exact location where an American service member was killed. The AWMO works to identify, document, and preserve these monuments, markers and plaques.Frances Moreton, August 2011, \\"Message from the Director\\", War Memorials Trust Bulletin, 3 Board of directors The non-profit works solely on the basis of volunteers. *Founder: Lillian A.

While the Spanish names are official, many researchers continue to use the older English names, particularly as those were the names used when Darwin visited.

During the Qing dynasty, in the 1800s, the Ningbo authorities contracted Cantonese pirates to exterminate and massacre Portuguese pirates who raided Cantonese shipping around Ningbo. The massacre was \\"successful\\", with 40 Portuguese dead and only two Chinese dead, being dubbed \\"The Ningpo Massacre\\" by an English correspondent, who noted that the Portuguese pirates had behaved savagely towards the Chinese, and that the Portuguese authorities at Macau should have reined in the pirates. Battle and Massacre Portuguese pirates who raided Cantonese shipping in the early 19th century were exterminated by Cantonese forces around Ningbo. The people from Ningbo supported the Cantonese massacre of the Portuguese pirates and the attack on the Portuguese consul. The Ningbo authorities had made an agreement with a Cantonese pirate named A'Pak to exterminate the Portuguese pirates.

Plot Gianni (Gianni Di Gregorio) is 60 and might as well be invisible (except when others need something from him). Smothered by his mother (Valeria De Franciscis), ignored by his wife (Elisabetta Piccolomini), and befriended (against his will) by his daughter's layabout boyfriend, he finds retirement to be not quite what he'd hoped for. He sets out to find himself a love life, to comic and charming effect. Critical reception The film has received widespread critical acclaim. The Guardian wrote: The Salt of Life \\"is packed with subtly observed details of behaviour and gesture of a kind we associate with Ealing comedy at its zenith, and an elaborate Chekhovian story is being told before we realise it\\". Los Angeles Times wrote: \\"rueful, funny and wise...a comedy not of errors but of the tiniest of missteps. A warm yet melancholy film of quiet yet inescapable charm, it has a feeling for character and personality that couldn't be more delicious\\". Roger Ebert wrote that the film \\"tells his story in an affectionate, low-key way, not as a smutty sex com but as a gentle look at a harmless man who realizes he has become invisible, except to people who need something from him\\". The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \\"The same, broad festival and arthouse audiences that gushed over by Mid- August Lunch will eat up The Salt of Life, which resembles the first in tone but doesn't just cash in on a lucky formula. The added spice ‚Äì more secondary characters, more melancholic chords ‚Äì shows Di Gregorio's maturation as a filmmaker and despite the casual, v√©rit√© atmosphere, there's nothing arbitrary in this wistful ode to women by a man who's becoming invisible to them.\\"  See also  * List of Italian films of 2011 References External links  Interview with Gianni * The Salt of Life 2011 comedy films 2011 films Italian films Italian-language films Zeitgeist Films films Films directed by Gianni Di Gregorio Italian comedy films ","title":"The Salt of Life"},{"id":"34139897","text":"Emirler is a village in the District of Haymana, Ankara Province, Turkey.

She and her husband, filmmaker D. A. Pennebaker, founded the company Pennebaker Hegedus Films. Hegedus was nominated for an Academy Award for The War Room, a behind-the-scenes film about President Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign. The film also won the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures prize for Best Documentary. In 2001, she was awarded the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement for Startup.com. The film is a boom-bust story of two young internet entrepreneurs, co-produced with Jehane Noujaim. Hegedus is also the recipient of CINE's Golden Eagle Award, an Emmy Award, and lifetime achievement awards from several organizations including the International Documentary Association. Her recent films include the 2010 feature release, Kings of Pastry, about the legendary French pastry competition, the Meilleur Ouvrier de France. In 2011, Hegedus received the Athena Film Festival Award for Exemplary Directing. Biography Hegedus studied Fine Arts at the Hartford Art School and graduated in 1973 from Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in photography and experimental film making. Afterward, she moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, and began shooting films for the University of Michigan Burn Center. In 1975, she moved to a loft in New York City and worked as a cinematographer on independent films including Lizzie Borden's feminist feature, Born in Flames. The following year she began her first collaboration with D. A. Pennebaker as editor of the feature-length film, Town Bloody Hall, a chronicle of the legendary \\"battle of the sexes\\" between Norman Mailer, Germaine Greer and other feminists which took place in 1971 at The Town Hall in New York City. The film became the basis for the play The Town Hall Affair by The Wooster Group in 2017.\\"Norman Mailer's Snarling Encounter with Feminism, Restaged In Trump's America\\" by Rebecca Mead, The New Yorker, February 23, 2017 In 1977, Hegedus, Pennebaker and Pat Powell co- directed and edited The Energy War, a three-part special for PBS that focuses on the historic legislative battle to pass President Jimmy Carter's Energy Bill. The film was cited by the Kennedy School of Government as \\"one of the best films on government.\\" From this point on, Hegedus and Pennebaker became partners co-directing, shooting, and editing films ‚Äì they married in 1982. Together, they directed a host of films including: DeLorean, a profile of automobile entrepreneur John DeLorean as he develops his stainless steel gull- winged car in Northern Ireland; Rockaby, a play that Samuel Beckett wrote specifically for their project with his muse, actress Billie Whitelaw; and Moon Over Broadway, a back-stage view of Carol Burnett's tumultuous return to Broadway, which is cited by The New York Times as a \\"NYT Critics' Pick.\\" The company has devoted much of its creative energy towards short and feature- length films about music. Their 1979 short of Randy Newman's song \\"Baltimore\\" predates MTV and was one of the templates of the music video format. In 1989, they released the theatrical feature 101 for Warner Music. In a style later popularized in the TV reality series Real Life', the film followed the popular English band and a bus full of fans across the country to their final Rose Bowl concert. Other music-related films include profiles of songwriter Victoria Williams, Branford Marsalis, and Suzanne Vega. Searching For Jimi Hendrix features eleven musical acts, including Los Lobos, Laurie Anderson, Chuck D, and Rosanne Cash interpreting Jimi Hendrix in their own styles. In 2000, for Miramax Films, Hegedus and Pennebaker directed Only the Strong Survive, a soulful musical tribute with Isaac Hayes, Wilson Pickett, Rufus Thomas, Sam Moore, Mary Wilson of The Supremes, Jerry Butler and others. Down From the Mountain, the 2001 companion concert film to the Coen brothers' release, O Brother, Where Art Thou?, features some of the most talented bluegrass performers of our times, including Ralph Stanley, Emmylou Harris, Alison Krauss, and Gillian Welch. Together with Nick Doob, Hegedus and Pennebaker filmed several specials for HBO, including Elaine Stritch at Liberty, which won a 2004 Emmy Award for Best Music, Comedy or Variety Show; the comedy Assume the Position with Robert Wuhl; and a segment of Addiction. For the Sundance Channel, Hegedus filmed Michael Stipe, Bruce Springsteen and others for the 2004 Vote For Change concert, and directed Fox vs. Franken for Sundance's First Amendment series. In 2006, Hegedus theatrically released, Al Franken: God Spoke. Co-directed with Nick Doob, the film follows the political satirist Al Franken's personal transformation from comedy to politics. Following the 2010 completion of Kings of Pastry, Hegedus and Pennebaker co- directed the live YouTube broadcast of the National's May 2010 benefit concert at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.Pitchfork: D.A. Pennebaker to Direct the National In 2016 Hegedus directed \\"Unlocking the Cage\\" about animal rights attorney Steven Wise and the Nonhuman Rights Project's legal challenge for personhood rights for chimpanzees. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival was nominated for an Emmy Award and broadcasts on HBO. Hegedus has lectured on documentary film in colleges around the country. She taught film at Yale University for eight years and received their Film Studies Award. Pennebaker Hegedus Films Chris Hegedus and D. A. Pennebaker co-founded the company Pennebaker Hegedus Films. The company is managed by Frazer Pennebaker who has served as the producer on all of their films since the mid-eighties. In addition to his role as producer, Frazer oversees film distribution and sales for the company. Process and style Hegedus and Pennebaker's films are done in the Direct Cinema style. \\"Voice-of-God\\" narration is avoided, as are formal \\"Talking Head\\" interviews. A mobile hand-held camera and diegetic sound are also characteristic. Usually Direct Cinema films show us the \\"back stage\\", be it of the Rolling Stones as in Gimme Shelter, or JFK in Primary, or Bob Dylan. The stylistic concerns of Hegedus and Pennebaker place them in the legacy of Direct Cinema along with Robert Dew, Richard Leacock, and the Maysles brothers.

He studied theology at G√∂ttingen, but devoted himself to geographical studies, and for 33 years taught history and Greek in the Hamburg gymnasium. He was also superintendent of the Hamburg library, and collected about 10,000 maps and nearly 4,000 books relating to America. Ebeling's magnum opus was a Geography and History of North America (5 vols., Hamburg, 1796‚Äì1816), forming a continuation of B√ºsching's General Geography. He received a vote of thanks from the United States Congress for this work. He was noted for his extensive knowledge of oriental languages, of classic and foreign literature, and of history and geography. Ebeling's collection was purchased by Israel Thorndike in the year after Ebeling's death, and given by him to Harvard. As a result, Harvard's library collections grew massively, virtually overnight. Through Thorndike, Ebeling's maps became the founding gift that created the Harvard Map Collection.

Described as a \\"documentary-propaganda\\" film by its studio, Paramount Pictures, the historical drama is based on documented fact and marks the first serious effort to portray Hitler in film. The filmmakers chose to avoid casting stars in the lead roles, assembling instead a remarkable company of lookalikes to play Hitler, Goebbels, Himmler, G√∂ring, and other leading Nazis. Plot In 1918 a young soldier called Adolf Hitler recovers from being gassed during World War I. At the behest of the German Army, he joins German nationalistic parties, espousing theories that Germany lost the war because they were stabbed in the back. He rises to become dictator of Germany. Cast Walter Abel and Albert Dekker narrate The Hitler Gang. * Robert Watson as Adolf Hitler * Roman Bohnen as Captain Ernst R√∂hm * Martin Kosleck as Joseph Goebbels * Victor Varconi as Rudolf Hess * Luis Van Rooten as Heinrich Himmler * Alexander Pope as Hermann G√∂ring * Ivan Triesault as Pastor Niem√∂ller * Poldi Dur as Geli Raubal * Helene Thimig as Angela Raubal * Reinhold Sch√ºnzel as General Erich Ludendorff * Sig Ruman as General Paul von Hindenburg * Alexander Granach as Julius Streicher * Fritz Kortner as Gregor Strasser * Tonio Selwart as Alfred Rosenberg * Richard Ryen as Adolf Wagner * Ray Collins as Cardinal Faulhaber * Ludwig Donath as Gustav von Kahr * Ern≈ë Verebes as Anton Drexler * Walter Kingsford as Franz von Papen * Fred Nurney as General von Epp * Arthur Loft as Colonel von Reichenau * Lionel Royce as Fritz Thyssen Production Paramount Pictures production chief Buddy De Sylva was inspired to make The Hitler Gang after he saw the 1941 Nazi propaganda film, Ohm Kr√ºger. \\"The Germans did a good job on that picture,\\" De Sylva said. \\"Their production was excellent, their story was dramatic and though we know the picture is a lie, other peoples may not realize it. What we're doing is taking a different tack. We're telling the true story about Hitler and six other leading German gangsters ‚Ä¶ We're not going to exaggerate; instead we're going to use understatement on the theory that it will make the picture more realistic still.\\" Paramount called The Hitler Gang a \\"documentary-propaganda\\" film. Pre-production began in March 1943. Extensive research was done to accurately document events, at a cost that exceeded $40,000. Great care was taken to authentically reproduce every detail of German uniforms, medals and weaponry. The screenplay was written by Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich. The first serious attempt to portray Hitler in film, The Hitler Gang proved to be a serious historical drama. Robert Watson was an uncanny match for Hitler, and he was surrounded by superlative character actors‚Äîmany of them immigrants who had fled Nazi Germany. Reception The Hitler Gang was recommended by the National Board of Review, which called it \\"an interesting film purporting to be the real story of Hitler's rise to power and the part played by Roehm, Goebbels, Hess, Himmler, Goering and other Nazis. Many of the well-known historic episodes such as the Munich beer hall putsch, the burning of the Reichstag, and the blood purge of 1934 are dramatically shown. The film is honest in its effort to render an accurate account of the Nazis, but suffers somewhat from an over-simplification of history.\\" Life magazine featured the film as \\"Movie of the Week\\" in its issue dated May 15, 1944. \\"The Hitler Gang is best when it follows the narrative of history,\\" Life stated. \\"Its great weakness, however, is that history is still in the process of working out the last act and so the movie has no place to go at the end. ‚Ä¶ The originality of The Hitler Gang is largely the result of the amazingly lifelike characterizations given by Robert Watson as Hitler, Victor Varconi as Hess, Martin Kosleck as Goebbels and Luis Van Rooten as Himmler.\\" \\"There is little point in considering The Hitler Gang as entertainment in the accepted cinema sense,\\" wrote a contributor to The New York Times, which regarded the film as a work of propaganda. \\"As the most complete pictorial documentation we have to date on the birth and growth of nazism, it has a place unique, resisting comparison or qualitative judgment. Those of us, and that is practically all- embracing, who would profit by seeing, close up, the genesis and spread of an ideological virus, would do well to see The Hitler Gang.\\" Bosley Crowther of The New York Times cautioned that \\"the emphasis in this picture is so heavily upon the 'Hitler gang' and upon the inside intrigues by which it gained and held its power, that the impression conveyed is that these leaders are entirely responsible for the Nazi state. ... It means that the grave responsibility of the German citizens for what they have allowed has been neatly tossed onto the shoulders of a few ruffians, Army officers and industrialists.\\" Cultural references Untitled (The Hitler Gang), a 1944 collage by Kurt Schwitters, incorporates a newspaper advertisement for the film.

A Jabberwocky sentence is a type of sentence of interest in neurolinguistics. Jabberwocky sentences take their name from the language of Lewis Carroll's well-known poem \\"Jabberwocky\\". In the poem, Carroll uses correct English grammar and syntax, but many of the words are made up and merely suggest meaning. A Jabberwocky sentence is therefore a sentence which uses correct grammar and syntax but contains nonsense words, rendering it semantically meaningless.  Interest in neurolinguistics  Jabberwocky sentences are of interest in the field of neurolinguistics, because they allow for the study of syntactic processing in the absence of semantic content. A study by Hahne and Jescheniak (2001) demonstrated that test subjects presented with blocks of Jabberwocky sentence trials and blocks of regular sentence trials at least one week apart demonstrated an early left anterior negativity or N150 in the event-related potential recording upon encountering a phrase structure violation in either type of sentence. The N150 was followed by a P600, indicating an attempted reinterpretation of the sentence by the brain. While the N150 is expected in the presence of phrase structure violation in normal sentences, in a Jabberwocky sentence, it indicates the processing of morpho-syntactical structure in the absence of lexical semantic content. This implies the existence of a syntactic pattern recognizer, which would interpret word class based on inflectional morphology and word order. A second study by Silva-Pereyra et al. showed that preschoolers at the age of 36 months demonstrate similar processing patterns compared to adults when processing normal sentences with phrase structure violations, showing ERP activity analogous to the N150 and P600 in adults, but shifted later in time. When presented with phrase-structure violations in Jabberwocky sentences, however, preschoolers demonstrate activity analogous to a N400, typically associated with the extraction of meaning from words in adults, along with a diminished P600. This implies that semantics plays a role in syntactic processing in children and provides neurobiological evidence for interactive theories over modular theories of semantic and syntactic processing.Juan Silva-Pereyra, Barbara T.

It focused on the cult of personality in North Korea, and was shot in 1988 on the 40th anniversary of the state's founding by Kim Il-sung. Despite its anti- totalitarian message, it has received praise from North Korea itself. Overview The documentary was made on the occasion of the 40th anniversary celebrations of state's founding in North Korea, which the regime intended to use to eclipse the 1988 Summer Olympics taking place that year in Seoul, South Korea. The North Korean regime invited filmmakers from countries then considered friendly (Communist), including People's Republic of Poland, which sent a team under Andrzej Fidyk. The documentary is primarily composed of declarative statements, as well as texts of North Korean newspapers and books. There was no author's commentary. Fidyk commented that he and his team were likely \\"the most disciplined\\" foreign team of filmmakers in North Korea, as they did not trouble the regime by looking under the surface - they were content with what they were given and asked to do. Reception In North Korea, the documentary, upon its release, was officially praised, as it contains only officially approved footage and materials. However, the documentary's real aim, widely recognized abroad, was to condemn the totalitarian regime, through shocking contrasts of official images, and documenting artificial behavior of the populace. The message is conveyed not through commentary, but through footage, montage and content selection. Following the official guidelines, Fidyk \\"winks\\" at the viewer, showing the falseness of the setting. The film was accepted by the Polish censors, despite its critique of the totalitarianism. In Poland, which has been a much more liberalized socialist country since October 1956, it has been well received. With support from the Polish Ministry of Education it has been incorporated into some Polish educational curriculum, primarily in the Education about Society courses. It is used to illustrate concepts such as propaganda, newspeak, and the totalitarian state. Even more surprisingly, Fidyk also received official thanks from North Korea that year, during the Krak√≥w festival, even as the documentary was gathering praise from various festivals for its anti-totalitarian message. Eventually, however, the real message of the documentary became transparent even to the North Korean regime, which resulted in Fidyk's classification as persona non grata in North Korea. The documentary received the Willy De Luca Prize for Documentaries in 1989 at the Prix Italia. It also received the Grand Prix at the International Film Festival in Leipzig, Golden Ducate in International Film Festival in Mannheim, Srebny Lajkonik (Og√≥lnopolski Festiwal Film√≥w Kr√≥tkometra≈ºowych in Krak√≥w) and Z≈Çoty Ekran (Nagroda Tygodnika \\"Ekran\\") in Poland, all in 1989. In 2008, Fidyk returned to this subject with another documentary on North Korea, Yodok Stories.

These Mataras (Devotees of Bachhus) belonged to Channa, Chauhan, Samma and Soomra castes who were the notables of Sari in the Kohistan area of Sindh. Their tombs are still to be found at the foothill of Narathar in Gadap tehsil of Karachi. Story An enterprising woman, Natar, had established a brewery and opened a tavern for care-free folks at the site of \\"Konkar\\" village in the present day Gadap town of Karachi. Her daughter Mokhi, a thoughtful and courteous girl, served as barmaid. The fame of the tavern and the name of Mokhi travelled far and wide and wine-bibbers, tipplers and revelers began to frequent the place. But, one day the Mataras, real devotees of Bacchus, came. They were eight adventurous young men, two each from the Samma, Soomra, Channa and Chauhan clans. They had come all the way from their distant quarters to drink the verities of mandh (wine) at this famous tavern. They enjoyed their drinks and decided to visit the place again. After six months, they came again and enjoyed the experience so much that they now determined to take this long journey to the tavern every six months. Mokhi served them whenever they came and each time they left satiated. Once, as they arrived, it so happened that no old wine was left to be served to them. Mokhi was much perturbed, but remembered an old wine jar long abandoned in the corner, and she hastened to it. The jar was full to the brim, but a cobra seemed to have fallen into it a long time ago; its flesh was dissolved and only the skeleton was left. \\"To serve or not?\\" mused Mokhi. Obviously, the wine had the venom of the cobra in it, though it was very colourful and had fermented a long time. So instead of disappointing her fond customers, she decided to serve them this wine, apologising at the same time that since no other wine was available, she had no choice but to offer them an old wine jar. They welcomed the offer, took sips and enjoyed the taste immensely. They asked for more of it and drank cup after cup. \\"Never did we taste such a wine,\\" they said admiringly. They were heavily intoxicated, and left the tavern enjoying the superb quality of the wine and praising this great act of Mokhi. After a year they returned. Mokhi was happy to welcome them, knowing that plenty of good-quality wine was available this time. She served them with grace and confidence, but after their first sips they returned the cups to her and asked for the wine they had been served the previous year. Mokhi was baffled at the situation. She tried another wine of excellent quality but that too was returned. They entreated to her to serve them the same old wine. Finding them desperate, Mokhi now saw no other way but to tell them the truth about the wine. \\"The wine that you had last year was from an old abandoned jar and it contained cobra venom.\\" \\"Cobra! A Cobra! What?\\" they cried in unison. The very thought of venom and its effect shocked them and they all fell dead on the spot and were buried there. The graves of these Matara, the stout men, are still seen in an old graveyard on the hillock. History and influence The story depicts socio-cultural aspects of Medieval Sindh in which the affairs of a tavern are run by women (Natar and her daughter Mokhi). The earliest reference of this saga are found in the verses of renowned poets of Sindh, Shah Karim, Shah Inat and Shah Latif. Later on other poets also alluded to it. The story finds numerous references in Sindhi folk poetry. The center of attention is a subtle psychological idea that \\"in genuine zeal and zest one survives a real hazard, but conscious feeling of the hazard may be fatal even after it is all over.\\" See also * Moriro * Culture of Karachi References External links * ŸÖŸà⁄©Ÿä €Ω ŸÖÿ™ÿßÿ±ÿß * ÿ≥ÿ± ŸäŸÖŸÜ ⁄™ŸÑŸäÿß⁄ªÿåÿØÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ ⁄ÜŸàŸøŸàŸÜÿåÿ¥ÿß⁄æ ÿ¨Ÿà ÿ±ÿ≥ÿßŸÑŸà Sindhi folklore Pakistani literature Pakistani folklore ","title":"Mokhi and Matara"},{"id":"34140463","text":"Chief is a four-person band from Santa Monica, California, stationed in Los Angeles, California.

The character has been portrayed by four actresses in total. The character first appeared onscreen in 1998 played by Fiona Glascott; however, the character left the series to go to London. On her return in 2000, Sinead Keenan was cast in the role. The character left the series for a second time and when she returned for a third time, the role went to Denise McCormack. The character again left the series to take up a photography course in London. In 2014, Caroline Harvey was cast in the role when the character's father Christy Phelan has a stroke. Storylines Backstory The Phelan family have been part of Fair City since the series began in 1989. Farrah's uncle, Hughie, is the first Phelan to appear in the series. As that character leaves Carrigstown, his mother Eunice Dunstan is introduced to the series and ‚Äì later ‚Äì her older son Christy and his wife Renee. As Hughie and his wife depart Carrigstown, the writers provided his brother and his sister-in-law as replacements. The Doyles ‚Äì the other major family in Fair City ‚Äì are growing up so it is thought the series needed a new family. This introduced teenage daughter Farrah to the series. Farrah is the first of the two Phelan siblings to be introduced. Her brother Floyd is introduced soon after (he has also been played by two separate actors). She also has a half-sister, Heather, whom Floyd unknowingly dated. The Phelans would later take over Doyle's shop ‚Äì now Phelan's Spar. Return After years living in New Zealand, Farrah returns to Carrigstown along with her husband Max Clayton when her father becomes unwell. Development The character has had several different styles over the years. Each of the actresses who have played Farrah have brought their own vision to the role. Fiona Glascott played the role as a hippyish guitar playing teen. Later, Sinead Keenan would add a more comic approach to the character. Denise McCormack played a more grounded Farrah. The actress who plays Farrah currently, Caroline Harvey, stated in an interview for the Irish Independent in 2016: \\"At the start I made the decision to do my own thing, and because there was a long gap between when Denise played Farrah and when I played her, it allowed me some breathing space.\\" References Fair City characters Female characters in television Fictional bartenders Television characters introduced in 1998 ","title":"Farrah Phelan"},{"id":"34140644","text":"Ewald Banse (born 23 May 1883 in Braunschweig ‚Äì died 31 October 1953 in Braunschweig) was a German geographer.

Filmed in Italy and Egypt, it stars the Italian comedy duo of Franco and Ciccio and was directed by Lucio Fulci. The film features a teaming of parodies of famous film secret agents.Hughes, Howard Cinema Italiano I.B. Tauris; 1 edition (30 April 2011) Plot Italian fisherman Franco and his father (both played by Franco Franchi) are fishing off the coast of Egypt when they see an American Air Force bomber crash in the water that was carrying nuclear weapons. Franco's father and the rest of the crew flees in a lifeboat, stranding Franco in the boat off the coast which soon beaches. When Franco swims ashore, he is kidnapped by Agent 87 (Ciccio Ingrassia) a member of an international criminal organisation, called SPECTRALES, in order to locate the nuclear weapon. SPECTRALIS is led by a shadowy man named Pasqualino (aka: Number One), who sends a local Egyptian scientist and SPECTRALIS employee, named Dr. Yes (Youssef Wahbi) (a parody of Dr. No), who wishes to use the energy of atomic weapon to reanimate Egyptian mummies. Ciccio is unable to extract information from the buffoonish fisherman for the atomic bomb's location. His attempt to threaten Franco with torture on a mechanical butt-kicking device backfires when Ciccio lets himself be talked into demonstrating the necessary posture himself. Franco escapes and arrives at a local train station. Too dim-witted to understand that he's in Egypt, he attempts to purchase a railway ticket back to his home in Palermo, but the language barrier is an obstacle as Franco cannot speak any Arabic. However, an Italian priest in line at the window helps him out by explaining where he is, and Franco treats the man to a cappuccino at the station bar. As Franco explains his predicament in detail to the bewildered priest, his hollering voice attracts the attention of a beautiful woman, named Cinzia (Julie M√©nard) who joins in on the conversation. Back at the SPECTRALLIS base in Egypt, Ciccio is attacked by three persistent but inept spies named James Bomb (Adel Adham), Modesty Bluff (Eugenia Litrel) and Derek Flit (Franco Bonvicini). However, they are so fixated on depriving each other of the catch then let him escape unnoticed while they brawl it out. Meanwhile, Cinzia has lured Franco back to her hotel room with the promise of an erotic liaison. Unknown to Franco, she is an agent for Dr. Yes. While her back is turned, however, Bomb, Bluff, and Flit break into the room and attempt to abduct Franco, with the same hilarious results as before. Then Ciccio arrives, grabs his prisoner back, and spirits him away to the base. This time Ciccio uses a lie detector to probe Franco's mind by asking him questions about the atomic bomb. Seeing that Franco knows nothing, Ciccio confides in him that his superiors will have him killed for failure to find the missing atomic bomb. Franco talks Ciccio into teaming up in hatching a plot to plant a fake atomic bomb where it can be found. Franco and Ciccio make contact with Cinzia who believes their claims that they have found the missing bomb. She tricks them into a meeting with Dr. Yes at his underground headquarters at a large villa outside Cairo. Franco and Ciccio learn that Dr. Yes is attempting to revive an Egyptian mummy of Nabuco Sonor, the Queen of the Dead. He requires the atomic bomb's radiation to achieve her reanimation. His experiment appear to be successful when he achieves a twitch of the thumb from a specimen. Franco and Ciccio deliver the fake bomb, only to be told that they will be sacrificed to the Queen of the Dead on her revival. The duo laugh, knowing that the bomb is not real. But their hilarity turns to terror when the mummy stands up and advances towards them. But Dr. Yes' plans are thwarted when the \\"mummy\\" is revealed to be Derek Flit in disguise. With the aid of Bomb and Bluff, Flit attack and beats up all of Dr. Yes' men, and then abduct Franco and Ciccio. Back out in the desert, the three inept spies fall out again over who will get the credit for turning them over to their superiors. They stop fighting each other when a live report on their car radio announces that the nations involved have given up the search for America has claimed that there was no nuclear bomb actually on board the plane that crashed. Franco takes the disgraced Ciccio aboard his fishing boat still beached on the shore to sail back to Italy. When they pull up the fishing nets to cast off, they discover the real atomic bomb which has been tangled in the boat's fishing nets this entire time. In the final scene set a few weeks later, Franco and Ciccio are aboard a yacht living in the life of luxury, with the atomic bomb pointed across the sea as they are blackmailing world leaders for untold riches by telephone to avert nuclear destruction.

Biography Jacqueline Moudeina was born and raised in Chad; however in 1979 after civil war broke out in the country, she quit her study of English at the University of Chad and fled to the Congo with her husband. They lived there for over 13 years before returning. While there, she received a master's degree in Private Law at the University of Brazzaville. She returned to Chad in 1995, after the reign of terror that occurred during Hiss√®ne Habr√©'s stint as president. She registered as a legal intern, and was one of the first women to have done so. She was then promoted to legal secretary, then by 2004 she was made the president of the Chadian Association for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights. During this ten-year period, she began accumulating evidence of the atrocities committed by Habr√© and his affiliates. On February 23, 2001, while Moudeina was participating in a peaceful demonstration in front of the French Embassy to denounce irregularities that occurred during the presidential elections, the Chief Police Commissioner Mahamat Wakaye ordered the dispersion of the demonstration through the use of force. Moudeina was wounded by a grenade during the event, and spent over a year in France recovering from her injuries. According to witness testimonies, Wakaye ordered the targeting of Moudeina during the attack.

The judge of the case indicted him for complicity in the acts of torture and barbarity. However, a year later the judge threw out the case saying it was out of Senegalese jurisdiction. Moudeina and the victims in turn filed the case in Belgium, because a law exists there that any person who committed acts of torture anywhere in the world could be indicted and tried. on May 30, 2016, Hiss√®ne Habr√© was convicted to life imprisonment.Pour Jacqueline Moudeina, la lutte continue.After five years of deliberation; the Belgium judge charged Habr√© with war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. An international arrest warrant was then placed on him, and extradition from Senegal was requested. He was arrested and detained for ten days, but the Senegalese prosecutor declared himself incompetent to follow through with the request. The Senegalese President called the case an African issue, and moved to put it before the African Union. In 2005, the African Union asked Senegal to prosecute Habr√© in the name of Africa, declaring that no African head of state should be tried outside of Africa. However, 6 years Senegal declared that it would not stage a trial against him. Moudeina is now attempting to extradite him through other international channels..

History In 1991, Fleetwood, Lancashire blues rock band Kiss of the Gypsy, led by singer/songwriter, Tony Mitchell, released their only album, \\"Kiss of the Gypsy\\". The band lasted only 3 years, 1 album and 3 singles after being signed to Atlantic Records USA in 1991. When Atlantic UK folded that same year, Kiss of the Gypsy was passed over to East West UK and in 1992 began work on a new album. The album was never released and with the lack of record company support, Kiss of the Gypsy disbanded in 1993. In 1993 Daz Rice opened a music store in Cleveleys Blackpool called Dazamakiz. Daz put all of his efforts into the shop and family but continued to write/record and perform, in 2010 he joined as lead guitarist and vocalist with well-known Blackpool and Fylde Coast local band The Blue Pig Orchestra. Recently Daz has a new side project/originals band 'Phantom Voices', www.phamtomevoices.com Keep up to date with Daz via www.dazrice.co.uk In 2004, Mitchell formed the XGypsy music production company with his wife Dawn, intended as a direct continuation of Kiss of the Gypsy and, since then, he has run his own recording studio and written for numerous bands and artists as well as soundtracks for TV/Film & Media, specialising in the horror/goth genre. After director Quentin Tarantino had used the track \\"Stuck in the Middle\\" by Stealers Wheel, in the soundtrack of his debut film Reservoir Dogs, there had been renewed interest in Stealers Wheel resulting from its inclusion. Tony Williams re-formed Stealers Wheel and in 2008, Mitchell was brought into the band to write and record songs for a new Stealers Wheel album, originally due to be released in 2012. In 2010, Mitchell released his own album, Black Rhapsody, as Kingdom of Dead Men. In 2011, under the pseudonym Syd Zilla, Mitchell joined forces with fellow Fleetwood musicians: Dunk Rock, vocalist with UFX, with whom Mitchell had previously collaborated in Gothic Metal band Puppet Master, and bassist Andy Wilkinson and drummer Tommy Couch, the rhythm section of internationally renowned punk rock group One Way System to form psychobilly band Boneyard Zombies to an excited press response. Boneyard Zombies released the limited edition \\"vinyl\\" CD album Death Rattle and Roll in 2012. Reception Kiss of the Gypsy received mixed reviews. Their 1991 debut single, \\"Whatever It Takes\\" was Single of the Week on release in Kerrang! magazine and reached number 4 in the Rock Charts. The band also played the single live on TV on ITV's James Whale Show and were featured in Kerrang! on several other occasions (issues 362, 378, 382 and 406 all carried lengthy articles on the band, including a 3 page interview in Issue 378). Despite the critical acclaim, sales of the group's albums were not especially high, particularly in the United States, and some critics criticized their music as \\"passionless\\", whereas others have praised the group and noted the influence of blues music in their songs.

Continuous consumption of alcohol over an extended period of time has been shown to raise cortisol levels in the body. Cortisol is released during periods of high stress, and can result in the temporary shut down of other physical processes, causing physical damage to the body. Cortisol Cortisol is a stress hormone secreted by the adrenal gland, which makes up part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. It is typically released at periods of high stress designed to help the individual cope with stressful situations. Cortisol secretion results in increased heart rate and blood pressure and the temporary shut down of metabolic processes such as digestion, reproduction, growth, and immunity as a means of conserving energy for the stress response. Chronic release of cortisol over extended periods of time caused by long-term high stress can result in: * Fatigue * Hypertension * Ulcers * Hampered growth * Cancer * Accelerated neural degeneration during aging * Impaired immune system.  Alcohol and cortisol interactions  High cortisol levels have largely been associated with high alcohol consumption, which is likely due to the disregulation (impaired inhibitory control) of the HPA axis.  History  Research on alcohol's effects on cortisol dates back to the 1950s. Many studies showed a relation between the two; however, they were limited to short-term alcohol ingestion. The first human study to assess the long-term effects of alcohol ingestion on cortisol was conducted in 1966 (Mendelson et al.). They found heightened cortisol levels in both alcoholics and non- alcoholics while actively drinking. Cortisol was overall higher in alcoholics than non-alcoholics, indicating that alcohol has long-term effects on the endocrine system. Also, alcoholics had the highest cortisol levels after drinking stopped, demonstrating symptoms of withdrawal (a hormonal marker of alcohol addiction).  Recent findings  Recent research supports this strong association between high alcohol use and heightened cortisol levels. In one study, overnight urinary cortisol levels were taken from people who regularly drank a large amount of alcohol versus a small amount of alcohol. People who drank more alcohol had higher cortisol levels and lower heart rate variability (which is controlled by the autonomic nervous system, ANS), suggesting a connection between the HPA axis and the ANS. People who drank more alcohol had higher blood pressure and difficulty sleeping, indicative of heightened cortisol levels. Recent technology has allowed researchers to measure cortisol levels in human hair (showing cumulative cortisol exposure over extended periods of time). This method of measurement has been used to compare long-term cortisol levels in alcoholics, abstinent alcoholics, and non-alcoholics. One recent study revealed that alcoholics had three to four times higher hair cortisol concentrations than abstinent alcoholics or non- alcoholics (consistent with previous research showing periods of alcohol consumption are associated with heightened cortisol levels). Abstinent alcoholics and non-alcoholics had the same low levels of cortisol, suggesting that cortisol levels eventually return to normal after extended cessation.

Life After Princess Jangsun died, Lady Han, who was born in the same year as the crown princess, was chosen to become the crown prince‚Äôs concubine Sohun, of rank 5b. Although she was not an official consort of the crown prince, she received treatment just like one. She gave birth to two daughter and two sons, but only one prince and one princess survived through childhood, one of them being royal grandson Grand Prince Jean. The crown prince took over the throne as Yejong after Sejo‚Äôs abdication due to his illness, but Lady Han was the one nominated by the former king to become the queen consort. Since she was almost due at that time, guards were sent to her maternal home to guide the future queen. Her years as the queen was short as Yejong died 13 months after his ascension to the throne and to make the situation worse, Grand Prince Jean was deemed too young to be invested as the next king. Hence, Queen Jeonghui and Han Myeong- Hoe, the Prime Minister at that time, chose Prince Jasan, Han Myeong-Hoe‚Äôs son-in-law and her nephew, to become her husband‚Äôs successor. Since she was the former king‚Äôs wife, she was legally the mother of the new king, Seongjong, and received the title Royal Queen Dowager Inhye (Ïù∏Ìòú ÏôïÎåÄÎπÑ). Conflicts happened when Seongjong‚Äôs birth parents were posthumously declared as king and queen as there was a need to determine the rank between Queen Dowager Inhye and Queen Dowager Insu. They both became Great Royal Queens Dowager when Yeonsangun became the nation‚Äôs ruler. She died when she was 53 years old and posthumously known as Queen Ansun (ÏïàÏàúÏôïÌõÑ).

It corresponded with the modern municipalities of Zapotitl√°n de Vadillo, Tuxcacuesco, Cuautitl√°n de Garc√≠a Barrag√°n and Tolim√°n. Prior to the Spanish incursion the area was split between the states of Amole, Cozolapa, Tuxcacuexco and possibly Tzapotitlan. Amole also had two dependent states, Copalla and Teotitlan. The indigenous inhabitants primarily spoke languages of the western Otomi group which was distinct from the language of the Otomi people of modern Hidalgo although it may have been related. The main languages were Amultecan, Bapame, Pino and Zapoteco (not to be confused with the Zapotec languages of Oaxaca). Amole and its neighboring states defeated Pur√©pecha attempts to invade the area early in the 16th century. The Spanish took over the area in 1523. By the early 1530s it was formed into the province of Amyla y Tuscacuesco although the name was shortened to just Amula. Religious change in the area was slower with the Franciscans first arriving in the 1540s but no permanent church organization formed until 1579. Sources *Gerhard, Peter.

The species is solely known from the Early Oligocene sediments exposed in central Oregon, USA. It is one of several extinct species belonging to the living section Ginnala. Taxonomy Acer ashwilli is known from a series of eight leaf specimens and nine samaras which were recovered from eight different outcrops of the Early Oligocene, Rupelian stage Bridge Creek Flora, part of the John Day Formation. When first studied by Leo Lesquereux and John Strong Newberry the Bridge Creek flora was thought to be Miocene age, while Frank Hall Knowlton placed the flora into the Eocene Clarno Formation in 1902. It wasn't until Ralph Works Chaneys studies of the fossils in the 1920s that the age was corrected to the Early Oligocene. The Bridge Creek flora is identified as a fully temperate flora, and represents the transition of the Oregon floras from older \\"borealtropical\\" forests to more modern forests most similar to the temperate deciduous hardwood assemblages of Southeast Asia. A. ashwilli, when first described, was placed into the Acer section Trilobata which was erected by Antonina Pojarkova. Later molecular studies have shown Trilobata not to be a natural grouping, and the section and included species have been moved into the Acer section Ginnala. The type specimens for Acer ashwilli are placed into three different repositories. The holotype leaf type specimen, a part and counterpart numbered UCMP 9036A, B along with six paratype leaves and seven paratype samaras are currently preserved in the paleobotanical collections housed at the University of California Museum of Paleontology, in Berkeley, California. Four other paratype leaves and three paratype samaras are housed in the National Museum of Natural History, part of the Smithsonian while the last paratype leaf is part of the University of Oregon Museum of Natural and Cultural History collections in Eugene, Oregon. The specimens were studied by paleobotanists Jack A. Wolfe of the United States Geological Survey, Denver office and Toshimasa Tanai of Hokkaido University. Wolfe and Tanai published their 1987 type description for A. ashwilli in the Journal of the Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University. The etymology of the chosen specific name ashwilli is in recognition of Melvin Ashwill for his years of collecting fossils from around the Madras, Oregon area and for his assistance to the authors in locating Acer specimens from the Madras area. Description Leaves of Acer ashwilli are simple in structure, with perfectly actinodromus vein structure and are ovate to very wide ovate in shape. The leaves are three-lobed with the lateral lobes are two thirds as long as the median lobe and all lobes being triangular in outline with the medial lobe a wider triangle then the lateral lobes. The leaves have three primary veins, between seven and nine secondary veins, and range between long by wide in overall dimensions. The samaras of A. ashwilli have a moderately inflated nutlet and smoothly diverging veins which rarely anastomise. The overall shape of the nutlet is elliptic with the average length of the samara up to and a wing width of . The paired samaras of the species have a 20¬∞ to 30¬∞ attachment angle and the distal region of the nutlet and wing forming u-shaped shallow sulcus.

History  Under the Sukarno administration, on August 24th, 1962, the opening ceremony for the Asian Games was Indonesia's first national TV broadcast. On May 20, 2009, two consortium television broadcasters completed a trial run for digital television. The Indonesian Supreme Court canceled Communication and Information Ministry Regulation No. 22 of 2011. In December 27, 2013, the Communication and Information Ministry released Communication and Information Ministry Regulation No. 32 of 2013. On March 5, 2015, the Pengadilan Tata Usaha Negara (PTUN), or Administrative Court, repealed the Communication and Information Ministry Regulation Number 22, from 2011 that had been canceled by the Supreme Court. Digital television transition took place in 2 stages. The first phase of simulcast started in January 2020 in 12 provinces, and later in 22 provinces on March 2020.

These services have to follow open access and non-discriminatory principles. * Other LPS and LPS with analog broadcast can rent bandwidth from LPS at the discretion of the Communication and Information Minister. * Local LPP and LPK with analog broadcast should cooperate with LPP TVRI. Note: LPP or Lembaga Penyiaran Public (Public Broadcasting Body), LPS or Lembaga Penyiaran Swasta (Private Broadcasting Body), LPK or Lembaga Penyiaran Komunitas (Community Broadcasting Body) The only significant change between old and new regulations was the elimination of the analog switch-off. The zonal term was changed by provinces and sets the new initial time of digital broadcasts. Zones and Provinces are the same as well as the license. The Indonesian Local Television Association (Asosiasi TV Lokal Indonesia - ATVLI) intended to appeal again to the Supreme Court if the new regulation, mainly the multiplexing license selection, is still burdensome for local television broadcasters.

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Ben Hardaway. The short was released on January 9, 1935, and stars Buddy, the second star of the series. Summary Buddy whistles merrily along a sidewalk, quickly coming to a bookstore with a sign reading \\"Boy wanted\\" in the window. Taking the sign, he strolls in to find the proprietor of the shop, a matronly lady, busily invested in her work and inattentive of the young man's presence. Clearing his throat, Our Hero makes himself and his intentions known to the woman. The woman, after a brief inspection of the candidate, hires Buddy to dust the store. Getting right to work, Buddy dusts everything he sees. His boss, leaving, orders him to watch the store while she is away and to put away all of the books left on the table. No sooner has the boss lady left than Buddy is attempting to fit in his grasp about a dozen books at once! A fly causes Buddy to lose his balance, crash into a stove, and drop every volume. One of the books, now open to him, tells of life in the Foreign Legion, and Buddy becomes so engrossed in reading that he forgets the tasks assigned him and sits down at a desk, where he daydreams about Amazons, such as the book describes. Our Hero is now the leader of a detachment of the Legion, marching through the desert, singing \\"Arabia.\\" After the musical number, we come to a fortress controlled by Amazons (as the flag above the building makes clear). Within, large women force smaller, captive Legion soldiers to do chores. One pushes a quern-stone and one washes laundry with water provided by a wheel turned by the efforts of a third man, who, for his lazy walking, is prodded by a projectile emitted by the hookah of the Amazon leader. One Amazon, looking through a spy-glass, sees the legionnaires, and announces their coming to the leader. The leader calls for an attractive genie woman. The genie travels, by magic carpet, into the path of the Legion. Dancing seductively, the genie eventually manages to turn the heads of all the soldiers, save trumpeter Buddy; all are led away to their enslavement. Buddy faces about, ordering the company to halt. Realizing that his men are gone, Buddy runs off into the distance. The soldiers, in their trance, are brought into the Amazon fortress. As each man enters, the Amazon leader knocks him aside. One legionnaire, wearing spectacles, indicates his proclivity. The Amazon simply removes his glasses, and then lands her blow. Legionnaire Buddy, having found the fortress, steps through the same threshold, but the Amazon's fist misses him, as he is quite a bit shorter than the other soldiers. Our Hero runs about, avoiding swords, and causing the warrior-women to chase him. One Amazon finds herself trapped in what may be a laundry chute, and several others are knocked clear into the sky by a water vessel spinning atop a well. Then, another Amazon emerges from the same well, shaking Buddy from behind. Buddy awakens, and it turns that his new adversary is none other than his boss, who has returned to her shop. Dragged by the collar, Buddy is, unceremoniously but obligingly, ejected from the store: \\"Okey-dokey!\\" he calls back. Joe Penner This marks the second time that a Buddy cartoon sports a reference to Joe Penner. A camel, belonging to a distracted legionnaire, is pulled by the tail, to which treatment it responds: \\"Don't ever DO that!\\" A similar joke occurs in Buddy's Adventures. Use of thorn (√û) Another similarity that this short bears to Buddy's Adventures is the use of the definite article \\"Ye,\\" phonetically identical to \\"The\\"; the \\"Y\\" is a convenient replacement for the originally Old English glyph √û, called \\"thorn.\\" In Buddy of the Legion, the article is found in the name of the bookstore: \\"Ye Olde Book Shoppe.\\" References External links  1935 films 1935 animated films 1930s American animated films 1930s animated short films American films American black-and-white films Bookstores in fiction Films scored by Bernard B.

The intended location (outside the territorial seas of the United States, 12 nautical miles from the coast of California, in the so-called \\"contiguous zone\\") would enable non-U.S. startup entrepreneurs to work on their ventures without the need for a US work visa (H1B), while living in proximity to Silicon Valley and using relatively easier to obtain business and tourism visas (B1/B2) to travel to the mainland. After the conclusion of their incubation on the vessel, successful startups may relocate to Silicon Valley and employ a local workforce. The project received wide media coverage and the promise of funding from venture capitalist Peter Thiel, who also supports the Seasteading Institute, who ultimately did not invest in the seed round. Blueseed later obtained in seed funding, Bitcoin investments, and $9M from an undisclosed investor, and planned to lease a ship for its platform. Launch was planned for summer 2014, provided that $18M more was raised. Blueseed is now on hold due to insufficient funding and the founders are working on different projects. History Blueseed was co-founded in July 2011 by Max Marty and Dario Mutabdzija, who had worked together at The Seasteading Institute as Directors of Business Strategy and Legal Strategy, respectively. Blueseed's CIO/CTO (later COO), Dan Dascalescu, who joined the company shortly after its incorporation, is also an ambassador for the Seasteading Institute. The stated motivations of the project include providing an entrepreneurial alternative to the Startup Visa Act, which has not seen any progress in Congress, and creating \\"a vibrant workplace for innovative industries to bloom, unencumbered by onerous regulations on new technology-sector businesses\\". On November 30, 2011, venture capitalist Peter Thiel offered to lead Blueseed's seed financing round. The number of startups that expressed interest in locating on Blueseed grew from 31 on November 14, 2011, to 60 a month later, to over 100 by February 2012, 133 on May 7, 194 as of May 9, more than 250 as of June 6, and 336 on December 13, 2012. In October 2012, Blueseed made public a page listing its partnerships with a number of other companies and organizations, including startup accelerators, incubators, and venture capitalists in the US and abroad, as well as companies that would help provide services and resources that could help Blueseed operate its seasteading platform. Notable partners include Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman (legal representation), Fenwick & West (legal representation), Startup Weekend, Nanyang Technological University, Golden Gate Ventures, Open Network Labs, Start-Up Chile, MassChallenge (global pipeline partners), Singularity University, the Seasteading Institute (Blueseed being the first commercial seasteading venture), and Shopify (e-commerce platform). In December 2012, Blueseed announced that it had successfully closed its seed round with funding from Mike Maples of Floodgate Fund as well as Trevor Kienzle of Correlation Ventures, Xu Xiaoping and Wang Qiang of ZhenFund, and other investors. Thiel decided not to invest in that round. In March 2013, Blueseed announced the project's launch cost to be $27M, of which $9M were reserved for an existing investor. In April 2013, first non- founder employee, CFO Sam Bhagwat, left after thirteen months. In July 2013, Blueseed closed a funding round from Bitcoin investors. On July 31, 2013, two years after its founding, Blueseed co-founder Marty announced that he was stepping down from his day-to-day activities at the company and taking the role of Chairman of the Board of Directors. Dascalescu, the erstwhile CIO/CTO, became the COO of Blueseed, while Mutabdzija took the role of CEO. Blueseed originally estimated a launch timeframe of Q3 2013 but has since revised its launch estimate to Q3-Q4 2014. A map of Blueseed's planned sea platform (and two buoys for positioning) in relation to the California coast. Also shown on the map are Half Moon Bay (the closest port) and the Silicon Valley area ranging from San Francisco in the north to San Jose in the south. The thick white line is the boundary of the official territorial waters of the United States. The cusp is due to the presence of the Farallon Islands, over which the US exercises territorial control, located in the north-west part of the map. Origins of the idea Blueseed co-founder Marty claims that the idea of Blueseed came to him while on a Reason Cruise in February 2011. Marty also cited his experience seeing fellow students at US universities leave the US because of the difficulty of getting visas for startups as an inspiration for the idea. A similar idea was proposed by Theresa Klein as an entry for The Seasteading Institute's \\"Sink or Swim Business Contest\\" for 2010 and won the second prize. The entry was titled \\"Boundless Talent Consulting Services\\" and the business plan was released under a Creative Commons Attribution license. Marty was one of the judges for that contest. The contest winners were announced in January 2011. Klein's proposal differed from Blueseed's plan in that Klein focused on workers in general who had difficulty getting H-1Bs whereas Blueseed has been focused on startups and entrepreneurs. A Los Angeles Times article about Blueseed noted that another company called SeaCode, led by Roger Green and David Cook, had attempted something similar in the past but had to put the project aside because they were unable to raise enough money to launch. SeaCode had been covered in the press as far back as 2005. Logistics The project plans to either convert a cruise ship or remodel a barge in order to provide a living accommodations, coworking space, and entertainment facilities for approximately 1,000 customers paying an average of USD 1500 in monthly rent (ranging between $1200 and $3000, and combined with a small equity stake). The vessel would be stationed 12 nautical miles from the coast of California, near the port of Half Moon Bay, and would have a crew of 200-300. The location is situated outside the territorial waters of the United States of America, thus not being subject to its immigration laws. Internet connectivity would be provided via a point-to-point microwave link, submarine communications cable, a laser link, or a mesh network of wireless routers placed on autonomous Liquid Robotics environmentally-powered ocean platforms. Legality The Blueseed ship will be stationed in the contiguous zone outside the territorial waters of the United States, which according to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, allows it to be present as long as it does not engage in the exploitation of natural resources, and exhibits no intent of infringing on the customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and regulations of the United States. In September 2013, Blueseed announced successful discussions with the United States Coast Guard regarding the legality and logistics of the project. Following the precedent set by the cruise shipping industry, the Blueseed ship will fly the flag of an open registry country such as Marshall Islands or The Bahamas, which will determine the de jure laws that apply on board. In terms of taxation, Blueseed will not impose tax; however, individuals are responsible for paying their financial dues according to their country of residence. Corporate tax will be paid by startups located on board based on the country of incorporation. Businesses that are generally illegal in the United States, such as gambling or prostitution, will be forbidden on the ship. Reception News anchor Melissa Francis called Blueseed a \\"genius idea\\". Craig Montuori, an evangelist for the Startup Visa, writes of Blueseed that \\"I can vouch for their passion on creating workarounds for jobs creating foreign entrepreneurs while waiting for Congress to create a Startup Visa as someone who has been advocating for Startup Visa for the past year.\\"Blueseed on AngelList Cyan Banister writes for TechCrunch: \\"Hats off to Max and Dario for dreaming big and trying to make a difference in the world.\\" Natalie MacNeil, an Emmy Award winner who has applied to be on board Blueseed's vessel, writes, \\"This is the perfect solution for me and my company; it‚Äôs everything I could possibly want. If I could, I would move my startup to Silicon Valley in a heartbeat but there isn‚Äôt a visa option for the stage I‚Äôm at and budget I‚Äôm working on. Up until discovering Blueseed, my lawyer advised me to get a job with a digital media firm since I qualify for an Extraordinary Ability Visa because I‚Äôm an Emmy Award winner. That Visa could lead to a Green Card in a few years and then I‚Äôd be able to continue with my business. But I truly believe the time for my business is now. I have so much momentum and I want to run with it.

Tancred and Gismund (Gismond variant spelling) is an English Elizabethan play published in 1591. It is a revised version of Gismund of Salerne, a play that was written and produced for the queen in 1566 by the gentlemen of the Inner Temple. The earliest extant English play derived from an Italian novel, each act of the five acts was produced by a different author. The play tells the story of a father, Tancred, whose widowed daughter, Gismund, returns home and begins a clandestine affair with one of her father's courtiers. He kills her lover and presents her with a gold cup containing his heart. She kills herself, and her father, stricken by grief and regret, does likewise, thereby extinguishing his kingly line. The play has been seen as an admonition to Queen Elizabeth I to choose a husband so that she might bear an heir, based on suitability rather than love. Characters * Tancred ‚Äì King of Naples and Prince of Salerne * Gismund ‚Äì widow, daughter of Tancred * Guiszard ‚Äì Count Palurin, Gismund's lover * Julio ‚Äì Lord Chamberlain to Tancred * Lucrece ‚Äì sister to Tancred * Renuchio ‚Äì Captain of Tancred's guard * Cupid ‚Äì God of love * Megaera ‚Äì a fury * Chorus of four maidens * Guard * Two furies Plot Tancred gave his only daughter, Gismund, to a foreign prince in marriage. After the death of her husband she returns home to her father, who had missed her so much during her marriage that he is determined that she never again marry. She falls in love with the Guiszard, Count Palurin, one of her father's courtiers, and he with her. She is able to meet with her lover by means of a secret cave under her bedroom, passing him the time of their meetings by concealing a letter in a cane. She meets her lover in the vault one day and while she is out her father comes looking for her. Thinking she has taken a walk, he lies on her bed, covers his head with a curtain and falls asleep. The lovers return and Tancred wakes and witnesses her daughter give herself to Guiszard. Engraving showing Ghismonda and Guiscardo being discovered by the Prince of Salerno Mario Balassi painting of Ghismonda being given a golden cup with her lover's heart Stunned, he says nothing but has Guiszard arrested and his heart cut out and placed in a golden cup, which is then delivered to Gismund. She fills the cup with tears and poison and drinks it. Too late, her father comes in. He grants her dying wish that she be entombed with her lover. Tancred fulfills his pledge and then kills himself as a warning to all hard-hearted fathers. Sources The main source of the play is \\"The Tale of Ghismonda and Guiscardo\\" from the first novella of Day Four of the Decameron. The tale was translated in William Painter's Palace of Pleasure (1566), but internal evidence indicates the authors worked from the original, and not Painter's translation.Cunliffe, John W. \\"Tancred and Gismund\\" in PMLA 21:2 (1906), pp. 435‚Äì62; 436‚Äì7. The play inspired at least five English tragedies by 1623, and in Elizabethan England was second only to Romeus and Juliet as a story of tragic love.Kingsley-Smith, Jane. Cupid in Early Modern Literature and Culture (2010) Cambridge University Press, pp. 77‚Äì8. Date and text The published play is a rewritten version of Gismund of Salerne, of which two manuscript copies survive, that was written and produced by five members of the Inner Temple for Queen Elizabeth during the revels entertainments.Cunliffe, John W. \\"Gismund of Salerne\\" in Early English Classical Tragedies (1912) Oxford University Press, p. v. Each act was written by a different author, named respectively as Rod. Stafford, Hen. Noel, G. Al., Ch. Hatton, and Robert Wilmot. The play was revised in keeping with \\"the decorum of these daies\\" by recasting the original rhyming lines into blank verse.Cunliffe 1912, p. lxxxvi. Earlier critics dated the original play 1567-8 by taking Wilmot's prefatory reference to his fellow Inner Temple collaborators to \\"the loue that hath bin these 24 yeres betwixt vs\\" and working back from the publication date. Chambers dates the play earlier to Shrovetide, between 24 and 26 February 1566 from an allusion in the manuscript to its performance at Greenwich and matching that to Elizabeth's itinerary.Chambers, Edmund (1923) The Elizabethan Stage.

His first director's credit was on the 1980 edutainment mini-series Archibald le Magichien (directly translated: Archibald the Magic Dog). In 1983, Bianchi scored his first major directing job on Inspector Gadget, a series he co-created with Andy Heyward and DiC's founder Jean Chalopin. Bianchi served as main character designer and supervising director on the show, which became one of the most iconic series produced by DiC. Subsequently, Bianchi worked as a director, producer and designer on numerous other DiC Entertainment, Saban Entertainment and SIP Animation television animation productions from the 1980s until the mid-2000s. His credits include Heathcliff (where he co-created the Cats and Company characters together with Jean Chalopin), Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors, M.A.S.K., Rainbow Brite, Diplodos (which he co-created and co-wrote with Jean Chalopin), Iznogoud, Princess Sissi and Gadget & the Gadgetinis (a spinoff of Inspector Gadget). In 2008, following the closure of SIP Animation, Bianchi founded his own studio, Ginkgo Animation. One of Ginkgo's projects had been George and Me (French title Georges et Moi), an adaptation of a 2006 Soleil Productions comic series that had first been picked up by SIP Animation as early as December 2007, and had been planned to start production at SIP at the beginning of 2009. However, by April 2011 this venture of Ginkgo's was considered unsuccessful due to changing priorities in the French animation industry, according to one of the authors of the original comics. Bianchi died on 2 December 2011 at the age of 56. He was buried in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris on 6 December 2011.

She was foaled in the United States but her connections were Canadian. Background Perfect Shirl was bred and raced by Canadian businessman Charles E. Fipke, who had also bred and raced her sire, Perfect Soul. Perfect Soul was a late-developing colt by leading sire Sadler's Wells who blossomed into a multiple graded stakes winner on the turf late in his career. Perfect Shirl's dam, Lady Shirl, was a grade I and was bought by Fipke at auction for $485,000 in 2005 as a broodmare prospect. Prior to foaling Perfect Shirl, Lady Shirl had produced Grade I winner Shakespeare and Grade II winner Lady Shakespeare. Although Lady Shirl's immediate family was unremarkable, her second dam descended from the \\"blue hen\\" mare La Troienne, one of the most distinguished female families of the 20th century. Perfect Shirl was trained by Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame inductee, Roger Attfield from his base at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario.Woodbine Entertainment Group Racing career Perfect Shirl did not race at age two, then failed to win in her first three races in 2010 at age three. She finally won for the first time in a maiden special weight race on the turf at Woodbine on June 13. She then followed up with a win on the Woodbine's Polytrack artificial dirt surface in an allowance race on July 11. On July 28, she was shipped to Saratoga racetrack for the Grade II Lake George Stakes on the turf, where she went off at odds of 9-1. Racing in the middle of the pack down the backstretch, Perfect Shirl started making up ground around the far turn and then moved to the lead as they neared the finish line. \\"When I asked her, she responded very well,\\" said jockey John Velazquez. \\"The only thing the assistant told me was not to be on the lead; very simple instructions!\\" Perfect Shirl then finished third in the Del Mar Oaks on August 21 and eighth in the Queen Elizabeth II Challenge Cup Stakes on October 16 at Keeneland. Atfield then gave the filly a long layoff, returning on April 16, 2011 in an allowance race at Woodbine. Perfect Shirl finished fourth and then lost her next five races as well. However, her performance in the Canadian Stakes was promising: she circled the field and closed rapidly to lose by only half-a-length. Despite her lengthy losing streak, Attfield decided to enter the filly in the Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare Turf, held that year at Churchill Downs on November 4. Ridden again by Velazquez, she was a 27-1 longshot in a quality field featuring Stacelita and several highly regarded horses from Europe. The course was wet, which concerned Attfield, but the going was rated as good. Perfect Shirl raced behind the leaders for the first mile, then moved to the center of the racetrack and accelerated past the leaders to win by three-quarters of a length. It was the first Breeders' Cup win for both Attfield and Fipke. \\"I had my doubts about running her,\\" said Attfield. \\"I was very concerned because she's never been able to handle a soft course. Once I saw how she was moving down the backside, I could see she was moving beautifully and I became very excited.\\" Perfect Shirl made one last start on February 25, 2012 in The Very One Stakes at Gulfstream Park. She finished eighth and was retired. Her first foal, More Perfect by More than Ready, was foaled in 2014.

It describes its aim as the \\"furtherance of interest and knowledge in the art, science and literature of the defence services\\". USI operates centres for research in various areas of national security. The USI Journal, published quarterly since 1872, is the oldest defence journal in Asia. It also publishes a number of monographs based on research and study by its members. History The United Service Institution was established in 1870 by Major General Sir Charles MacGregor in Shimla. It was founded as a society in the furtherance of interest and knowledge in the art, science and literature of the Defence Services. The institute was initially housed in the Old Town Hall, and later received temporary accommodation in the Indian Army Headquarters, which was also then based in Shimla. In 1908, the institute acquired its own premises near the Cumbermere Post Office in Shimla Hills. Among the distinguished officers who have served as its Secretary, was Field Marshal William Joseph Slim in the 1930s. After independence and the subsequent partition of India, the institute attempted to continue as a joint institution for both countries as the United Service Institution of India and Pakistan. The four 1948 issues of the institute's journal were published jointly. However, following the Indo- Pakistani War of 1947, cross-border relations were interrupted and the institute has since been known as the United Service Institution of India. Following independence, the institute went through financially testing times. It had to sell its Shimla headquarters. In 1953, the institute relocated to New Delhi. The institute survived primarily due to the efforts of Colonel (Retd.) Pyara Lal, its Secretary from 1957 to 1987. The institute operated in New Delhi from Kashmir House until 1996. The foundation stone for its current headquarters in Vasant Vihar, New Delhi, was laid on 26 April 1993, and the institute was relocated in 1996. Activities USI operates two centres of research and one centre for coaching predominantly Indian Army and limited Indian Naval officers for Professional Military Education exams. Centre for Strategic Studies and Simulation The Centre for Strategic Studies and Simulation (CS3) is focused on conducting research and analyses on national and international security issues. It leverages gaming and simulation of strategic scenarios, to explore options for wider discussion and consideration. Centre for Armed Forces Historical Research The Centre for Armed Forces Historical Research (CAFHR) studies the history of Indian Armed Forces. It focuses on diverse aspects of the services policies and practices‚Äîstrategic, tactical, logistical, organisational, socio-economic. CAFHR is organized into four research groups focusing on different periods of Indian history‚Äîthat before 1750, from 1750 to 1900, 1900 to 1947 and post-1947.

Ader was a professor emeritus at the University of Rochester Medical Center. Early life Robert Ader was born on February 20, 1932 in the Bronx, New York City. He was the older of two sons of Nathan and Mae Ader. After graduating from the Horace Mann School in New York City, he attended Tulane University in New Orleans. He graduated from Tulane University with a bachelor's degree in psychology in 1953. Ader then went on to earn a Ph.D. in psychology from Cornell University in 1957. After earning his Ph.D., he became a part-time instructor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Rochester and a part-time instructor in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Rochester School of Medicine & Dentistry. He spent his time at the University of Rochester conducting psychobiological research on animals. Academic career Robert Ader spent his entire career at the University of Rochester, where he held many teaching and research positions. He was appointed the director of the Division of Behavioral and Psychosocial Medicine in the University of Rochester‚Äôs department of psychology and director of the Center for Psychoneuroimmunology Research. He retired in July 2011 as professor emeritus of psychosocial medicine. During his career, he authored and helped coauthor over two hundred journal articles and chapters in books. He also founded the journal Brain, Behavior, and Immunity which he served as editor-in-chief for many years. He also served on editorial boards for various psychobiological and behavioral journals. In addition, he served as president of the American Psychosomatic Society from 1979 to 1982, president of the International Society for Developmental Psychobiology from 1981 to 1982, president of the Academy of Behavioral Medicine Research from 1984 to 1985, and president and founder of the Psychoneuroimmunology Research Society. He also received an honorary M.D. degree from the University of Trondheim in Norway. Research in psychoneuroimmunology On beginning his career as a part-time instructor in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Rochester, Robert Ader focused his research on behavioral conditioning and emotional responsiveness in rats. In 1974, he and a fellow researcher Nicholas Cohen were studying taste aversion in rats. The researchers gave the rats water sweetened with saccharin followed by an injection of cyclophosphamide, an immunosuppressant which caused nausea. Through classical conditioning, the rats learned to avoid water that contained saccharin. When Ader and Cohen began to force feed the rats the saccharin solution, they noticed that the rats began to die. They also found that the rate of death was directly related to how much saccharin solution the rats consumed. From these findings, they proposed a theory that the rats died because the taste of saccharin by itself was enough to elicit neural signals in the rats' brain that suppressed their immune systems as if they had been overdosed with cyclophosphamide. Due to weakened immune systems, the rats contracted bacterial and viral infections that they were unable to fight off. This finding led to the belief that there are connections between the brain and the immune system which contradicted with the previous belief that the immune system was autonomous. This serendipitous discovery led Robert Ader to continue research in and develop the field of psychoneuroimmunology, a term that he created and first used in his 1980 presidential speech to the American Psychosomatic Society. A year later, he also used the newly created term as the title for his collection of essays that described the beginning of a new field of research. Later life Robert Ader spent 54 years at the University of Rochester until his retirement in 2011. Ader died at the Highlands at Pittsford, New York, on December 20, 2011, at the age of 79. His death was caused by a long illness and complications due to a fracture he obtained from a fall. He was married to his wife of 54 years, Gayle Ader and they had four daughters.

It lies within the boundaries of the Rural Municipality of St. Laurent, from Winnipeg. A historically-M√©tis settlement, St. Laurent is one of the few remaining places in which the Michif language is still spoken.  History  Prior to the arrival of European colonists, the area between Lake Manitoba and Lake Winnipeg was contested among the Ojibwa, Cree, and Sioux peoples for much of the 18th century, with the Ojibwa ultimately achieving dominance. In the 1730s, La V√©rendrye was the first European who systematically explored the territory,. By the early 19th century, the interlake region of Manitoba was inhabited by Ojibwa Saulteaux, but it is unclear if any of the groups lived in the immediate vicinity of St. Laurent when it was founded. St. Laurent was established as Fond du Lac in 1824 by M√©tis leaving Pembina, North Dakota. Pembina, located in Rupert's Land, had been recently ceded by Great Britain to the United States via the Treaty of 1818, prompting the departure of the M√©tis there. More settlers arrived in 1826 as a result of flooding of the Red River of the North, with further growth driven by M√©tis in search of land and traders seeking to take advantage of trade routes to the northwest. The economy centred around fishing and the fur trade, with settlers serving as intermediaries with Cree and Assiniboine people. Sometime after its establishment as a parish in 1858, the community was renamed St. Laurent after a Catholic priest who established the permanent mission there or after the martyr St. Lawrence. Additional M√©tis settlers moved to St. Laurent in the aftermath of the Red River Rebellion ending in 1870. The broader area was formally incorporated as the Rural Municipality of St. Laurent in 1882. French-Canadians, Bretons, and Mennonites arrived in the first half of the 20th century.  Geography  The land is primarily glacial till with limited potential for agriculture, but some farming and cattle raising used to take place. The climate is continental with high variation between seasons. St. Laurent is in the Red River region of Manitoba, which is prone to flooding, and the village last suffered a major flood in the spring and summer of 2011. St. Laurent has no central town square and is not exclusively organized around central roads, which is partially the result of the influence of the seigneurial system of New France, which allotted land with respect to the waterfront.  Attractions  Twin Lakes Beach on Lake Manitoba. Attractions in St. Laurent and area include the following events and destinations. * Manipogo Festival is held at the end of the ice-fishing in March. * Manipogo Golf & Country Club near Twin Lakes Beach. * Meindl Beach and Sand Piper Park * M√©tis Days * M√©tis Music Festival is held yearly on the labour day weekend.

It was introduced in August 2011. The plan called for the replacement of all current taxes, such as the payroll tax, capital gains tax, and the estate tax, with a 9% personal income tax, 9% federal sales tax, and a 9% corporate tax. History In July 2011, an advisor suggested the name \\"the Optimal tax\\" for the Cain campaign's tax policy plan. Cain rejected the name, saying: The plan would replace the current tax code with a 9% personal income tax, a 9% federal sales tax, and a 9% corporate tax. During a debate on October 12, Cain said that his plan would \\"expand the base\\", arguing: Summary Cain's campaign website summarized the 9‚Äì9‚Äì9 Plan: > Our current economic crisis calls for bold action to truly stimulate the > economy and Renew America back to its greatness. The 9‚Äì9‚Äì9 Plan gets > Washington D.C. out of the business of picking winners and losers, using the > tax code to dole out favors, and dividing the country with class warfare. It > is fair, simple, transparent and efficient. It taxes everything once and > nothing twice. It taxes the broadest possible base at the lowest possible > rates. It is neutral with respect to savings and consumption, capital and > labor, imports and exports and whether companies pay dividends or retain > earnings. Under his plan, corporations would be able to deduct the costs of goods sold if the inputs were made in the US and capital expenditures, but not wages, salaries, and benefits to employees.. Paul Krugman. October 15, 2011 Deductions other than charitable giving would be eliminated. The federal sales tax would not apply to used goods. Cain claimed that the 9‚Äì9‚Äì9 Plan would lift a $430 billion dead-weight burden on the economy. Reception Cain supporters with signs celebrating his 9‚Äì9‚Äì9 plan Cain spoke about having designated empowerment zones, wherein a lower percentage such as 3% is paid instead. However, some have called Cain's plan more regressive than current tax policy at the time, stating that it would raise taxes for most households but cut taxes for those with the highest income. An analysis that the campaign released to Bloomberg News claimed that the lowest possible rate for each of the three taxes was 7.3%. Nevertheless, the campaign insisted on poverty grants, which Cain has described as a lower rate in targeted empowerment zones, would necessitate a national tax rate of 9%.Interview with Herman Cain Erin Burnett OutFront October 12, 2011 Paul Krugman has criticized the plan, saying that it shifts much of the current tax burden from the rich to the poor. Economist Arthur Laffer, financial analyst Larry Kudlow,Cain the Tax- Code Killer National Review October 14, 2011 and the Club for GrowthSeth McLaughlin, Club for Growth defends Cain's 9‚Äì9‚Äì9 tax plan Washington Times Inside Politics October 14, 2011 have spoken favorably of the 9‚Äì9‚Äì9 plan. On October 21, Cain told an audience in Detroit that the plan would be \\"9‚Äì0‚Äì9\\" for the poor, saying: Cain's 9‚Äì9‚Äì9 plan attracted skepticism from his fellow candidates at numerous Republican debates. In a debate on October 28, 2011, several of the other contenders for the GOP nomination attacked the plan.

Also, Arthur Laffer, a supply-side economist, told Human Events that Conversely, other economists did not believe that the 9‚Äì9‚Äì9 plan would stimulate demand. Bruce Bartlett, an economist under the Reagan and H. W. Bush administrations has written that Cain's plan \\"would increase the budget deficit without doing anything to stimulate demand.\\" The Economist criticized the 9‚Äì9‚Äì9 Plan, stating that the Cain plan would not result in a reduction in the current corporate tax but instead a new value-added tax (VAT). The newspaper also stated that Cain's final tax would be a 30% VAT, as compared to the 15% VAT in the European Union.\\"Dial 9‚Äì9‚Äì9 for nonsense.\\" The Economist, October 17, 2011. According to Cain, > Unlike a state sales tax, which is an add-on tax that increases the price of > goods and services, this is a replacement tax. It replaces taxes that are > already embedded in selling prices. By replacing higher marginal rates in > the production process with lower marginal rates, marginal production costs > actually decline, which will lead to prices being the same or lower, not > higher. 9‚Äì9‚Äì9 the Movie ‚Äì Slaying the Tax Monster During his campaign, Cain released a six-minute movie that explained his 9‚Äì9‚Äì9 Plan called 9‚Äì9‚Äì9 the Movie ‚Äì Slaying the Tax Monster. CBS News reported: Cain's Solutions Revolution On January 4, 2012, Cain announced the \\"Cain's Solutions Revolution.\\" His stated goal was to obtain commitments from members of Congress to support the 9‚Äì9‚Äì9 Plan before the 2012 elections. He had started a new movement, saying that the \\"biggest comment I got when I ended my candidacy was to keep 9‚Äì9‚Äì9 alive. That's what this is about, and I'm going to keep it alive with what I'm calling Cain's Solutions Revolution.\\" To promote the movement, Cain used both a bus tour and a new website. The New York Magazine stated that \\"it's Cain's earnest effort to keep 9‚Äì9‚Äì9 alive and focus on solutions.\\" On January 20, 2012, Cain spoke at Stephen Colbert's \\"Rock Me Like a Herman Cain: South Cain-Olina Primary Rally\\". The Huffington Post reported that between 3,000 to 5,000 people were in the crowd at the rally. The Hollywood Reporter called it \\"the largest campaign rally so far during this GOP presidential primary season\\", and The Philadelphia Inquirer said that it was \\"the biggest political rally of the primary season.\\" 9‚Äì9‚Äì9 Fund The 9‚Äì9‚Äì9 Fund is a political action committee (PAC) that was founded by supporters of Herman Cain. The PAC spent more than $468,000 in November 2011 to support Cain's presidential campaign. In December 2011, the 9‚Äì9‚Äì9 Fund director, Jordan Gehrke, stated that the 9‚Äì9‚Äì9 Fund had decided not to endorse a candidate for president. The Christian Post reported that the 9‚Äì9‚Äì9 Fund may continue to support Cain in the future.

Though he appears strong in the beginning, it is revealed he has low self confidence and does not want anyone to find out about his hidden past. He worked hard to become a mage and has a specific type of magic he likes best. Shion travels around in a dragon which has a house and many other rooms inside of it. He also cares for Emma very deeply, although he does not like to admit. His magical abilities are: ::*Magic Broom: Can lift objects and can be freely manipulated like a hand. Each strand can lift up to 200 tons. It will also spread and the individual strands can be used for different purposes. When up against a formidable opponent, it can protect the user by forming itself into a ball that nothing can penetrate. So far only Shion has used this type of magic. To use it, it is needed to complete ritual of defeating 1000 Agiri with a single broom. When not in use, this magic appears as a normal broom in the hands of the user until it is needed which it then grows in size. It is easily burned by flames or fire magic. It can be upgraded by a ritual sacrificing all the users happy memories. ::*Fire Magic: Face will be converted into a fire dragon, breathing fire from the mouth. ::*24 House: Creative magic system. House floor plan drawn on paper, can only be summoned for 24 hours.

Emma's life is constantly threatened by those who seek to kill her and claim the power of Echidna for themselves. In cooperation with Shion, they plan to seal Echidna and prevent it from awakening while also saving her life. She has grown strong feelings for Shion, but she tries to hide this fact, although she is not very good at it. ; :An orphan who resided in the outlands before meeting Shion and Emma. Her town, which had always distrusted her, used her as a sacrifice thinking it would change their luck. She survived the fall and had been living alone in the wilderness until she met Shion and Emma. She uses the powerful magic named Palm Exchange Magic. Because of the strength of this magic, Luu can also grow in age, but she cannot do it for very long and becomes weak for a long time afterwards. She becomes adopted by Shion and Emma after aiding them in one of their rituals and becomes the little sister of Anise. She is usually warm- hearted but can be very aggressive towards those who threaten her new family. Her magical ability is: ::*Palm Exchange Magic: To obtain this magic ability, one has to continuing to hit a rock a million times. It allows the user to change the appearance of ones fist depending on how many attack combos can be strung together. After the 100th combo, the attack is strong enough to revitalize the spirit body, and an 18-year-old Luu would form temporarily. ; : :A speaking female black cat wearing a red collar with bells hanging off. She has a wealth of knowledge, often to the description of a number of different magic and rituals. She is also a supporter to Shion and approves of his relationship with Emma, however, she often teases him about how he is not entirely open with his feelings, which often annoys him.

The canvas measures . It was originally gifted by Caillebotte's brother in 1894 to the Mus√©e du Luxembourg, then transferred to the Mus√©e du Louvre in 1929. In 1947, it was moved to the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume, which held many impressionist works in France after World War II. In 1986, it was transferred again to the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris, where it is currently displayed. The painting is one of the few Caillebotte works that have remained in public view since the artist's death in 1894. Caillebotte created many paintings showing urban Paris from unexpected perspectives, such as a streetscape seen from indoors in Jeune homme √† la fen√™tre (1875), or the exaggerated perspective of Rue de Paris, temps de pluie (1877). Vue de toits depicts snow-covered rooftops in Montmartre, Paris from a high vantage point, possibly a balcony. Here Caillebotte employs a largely monochromatic palette of grays, adding additional color to highlight building features. This perspective was not at all common in French paintings, and in fact Caillebotte may have been inspired by the photographic works of Hippolyte Bayard. The painting was first shown at the fourth Impressionist Exhibition held in Paris in 1879, one of 25 works Caillebotte brought to the show. At the time, it did not garner much interest from the crowds, who preferred his portraits and nautical images. However, this image, and one other showing views of rooftops at that show, are now considered important works.

Biography Dee was born in Bandung, West Java on 20 January 1976; she was the fourth of five children born to a religious Christian family. Raised to be active in music, she took up singing, later providing backing vocals for singers such as Chrisye. After graduating high school, she attended Parahyangan Catholic University and graduated with a degree in international relations. In 1993, she formed the girl group RSD (Rida Sita Dewi) with her friends Rida Farida and Sita Nursanti; together they released three albums and a greatest hits album on Warna Musik and Sony Music. In 2001, Dee released her first novel, Kesatria, Putri dan Bintang Jatuh (The Knight, The Princess, and the Falling Star). Part of the Supernova series, it was well received and spawned two sequels, Supernova: Akar (Supernova: Roots) and Petir (Thunder). Two of these were nominated for the Khatulistiwa Award, as was one of its sequels in 2003. In March 2006, Dee release Filosofi Kopi: Kumpulan Cerita and Prosa Satu Dekade (Coffee Philosophy: A Decade Worth of Stories and Prose). The collection of short stories and prose dealt with themes of love and spirituality and was described by literary critic and poet Goenawan Mohamad as being \\"Uncomplicated, in fact quite brilliant...\\" Mohamad went on to suggest that it would revive \\"wit\\" in Indonesian literature. At the same time, she released her first solo album, Out of Shell; the album had been in development since 1994. Two years later, Dee released Rectoverso, a \\"hybrid\\" of an album and a short story collection. The project started in 2006 when she wrote the song \\"Hanya Isyarat\\" (\\"Only a Sign\\") and, unsatisfied, wrote a short story with the \\"same theme and inspiration\\"; from this seemingly different but \\"actually one and complementary\\" arrangement, she derived the title. One of the songs, \\"Malaikat Juga Tahu\\" (\\"Angels Also Know\\"), was released as a single to warm reception. That year also saw her novel Perahu Kertas (Paper Boats) published. In 2011 Dee released another collection, Madre (Mother), which was inspired by her hobby of cooking; madre is also a kind of yeast used in cooking. The following year she released the fourth installment in her Supernova series, Partikel. During the writing process she researched various themes, including shamanism, ethnobotany, entheogen, crop circles and extraterrestrials. In an interview with The Jakarta Post, she said that in writing the book she had voice her \\"concerns about the environment, such as the destructive course we are taking and the future of humanity on this planet\\". The first film adaptations of one of Dee's novels, Perahu Kertas 1 and Perahu Kertas 2 (both from her novel Perahu Kertas) were released in 2012. The romance films starred Maudy Ayunda and Adipati Dolken. Although originally envisioned as a single work (originally five hours long), director Hanung Bramantyo and the production crew split the two, hoping to keep the mystery of whether or not the protagonists would unite. Dee worked closely with Bramantyo and his wife Zaskia Adya Mecca during the filmmaking process, helping with the casting and writing the screenplay. The second adaptation of her works, Madre, was released in 2013. As the source work was a short story collection, the film, directed by Benni Setiawan and starring Didi Petet, Vino G. Bastian, and Laura Basuki, was expanded to add more content. In an interview, Dee stated that, though the film worked as a romantic comedy, she found it had undergone \\"fairly crucial changes\\" (\\"perubahan cukup krusial\\") during the adaptation process, leading her to feel something was lacking. Film critic JB Kristanto was more vocal: he wrote that the melodramatic adaptation was a \\"soap opera brought to the big screen\\" (\\"sinetron versi layar lebar\\"). Plans are underway for film adaptions of Rectoverso and Filosofi Kopi, as well as a fifth instalment of Supernova. Themes and inspirations Dee often touches on themes of religion in her songs and writings. She notes that spirituality is her \\"driving force\\", but has said that she says \\"no\\" to religion. She has also touched on environmentalism. Poet Sitok Srengenge writes that Dee \\"offers unique and complex themes in each of her works, delivering her message with a smart and fresh narrative\\". She has been grouped with the sastra wangi (literally \\"fragrant literature\\") literary movement. Dee has cited American author Ana Castillo as inspiring her to write short stories, as they are not always the same length. Dee enjoys the works of fellow Indonesian writers Sapardi Djoko Damono, Seno Gumira Ajidarma, and Ayu Utami. She has also read philosophical works by Ken Wilber, Friedrich Nietzsche, Emanuel Kant and Martin Heidegger. In a 2012 interview, Dee said that she works perhaps three months a year, using the time to do her research and write. Of the writing process, she stated \\"it‚Äôs always the result of collaboration between seeds of ideas and my own willingness to work on it. So if one day I stop doing what I'm doing, perhaps that same dynamic won‚Äôt take place anymore\\". Personal life Dee married Marcell Siahaan, a fellow singer; together they have a son. They sometimes collaborated on writing songs. However, in 2008 they divorced; later that year Dee married holistic healer Reza Gunawan. In 2009 the couple announced their first child, who was born through an unassisted home birthing procedure. Dee says that her \\"perception about religion is probably different from other people's\\".

They are identified by their cultural similarities, common ancestry and common use of the Proto-Norse language from around 200 AD, a language that around 800 AD became the Old Norse language, which in turn later became the North Germanic languages of today. The North Germanic peoples are thought to have emerged as a distinct people in Sweden in the early centuries AD. Several North Germanic tribes are mentioned by classical writers in antiquity, in particular the Swedes, Danes, Geats, Gutes and the Rugii. During the subsequent Viking Age, seafaring North Germanic adventurers, commonly referred to as Vikings, raided and settled territories throughout Europe and beyond, founding several important political entities and exploring the North Atlantic as far as North America. Ethnic groups that arose from this expansion include the Normans, the Norse‚ÄìGaels and the Rus' people. The North Germanic peoples of the Viking Age went by various names among the cultures they encountered, but are generally referred to as Norsemen. With the end of the Viking Age in the 11th century, the North Germanic peoples were converted from their native Norse paganism to Christianity, while their previously tribal societies were centralized into the modern kingdoms of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Modern North Germanic ethnic groups are the Danes, Icelanders, Norwegians, Swedes, and Faroese. \\"[T]he pages of history have been filled with accounts of various Germanic peoples that made excursions in search of better homes; the Goths went into the Danube valley and thence into Italy and southern France ; and thence into Italy and southern France; the Franks seized what was later called France; the Vandals went down into Spain, and via Africa they \\"vandalized\\" Rome; the Angles, part of the Saxons, and the Jutes moved over into England; and the Burgundians and the Lombards worked south into France and Italy. Probably very early during these centuries of migration the three outstanding groups of the Germanic peoples ‚Äî the North Germanic people of Scandinavia, the East Germanic branch, comprising the Goths chiefly, and the West Germanic group, comprising the remaining Germanic tribes ‚Äî developed their notable group traits. Then, while the East Germanic tribes (that is, the Goths) passed gradually out of the pages of history and disappeared completely, the North Germanic, or Scandinavian, or Norse, peoples, as they are variously called, became a distinctive people, more and more unlike the West Germanic folk who inhabited Germany itself and, ultimately, Holland and Belgium and England. While that great migration of nations which the Germans have named the Volkerwanderung was going on, the Scandinavian division of the Germanic peoples had kept their habitation well to the north of the others and had been splitting up into the four subdivisions now known as the Swedes, Norwegians, Danes, and Icelanders. Long after the West Germanic and East Germanic peoples had made history farther south in Europe, the North Germanic tribes of Scandinavia began a series of expeditions which, during the eighth and ninth centuries, in the so-called Viking Age especially, led them to settle Iceland, to overrun England and even annex it to Denmark temporarily, and, most important of all, to settle in northern France and merge with the French to such an extent that Northmen became Normans, and later these Normans became the conquerors of England.\\" These ethnic groups are often collectively referred to as Scandinavians, although Icelanders and the Faroese are sometimes excluded from that definition. Names Ethnonyms Although the early North Germanic peoples definitely had a common identity, it is uncertain if they had a common ethnonym. \\"The same can be said of Viking Age Scandinavians who did not have a common ethnonym but expressed their common identity through the geographical and linguistic terms... There is absolutely no doubt about a common Northern identity during the Viking Age and afterwards... it even survives today. Their common identity was rather expressed through the geographical and linguistic terms The North Lands (Old Norse: Nor√∞rl√∂nd) and The Danish Tongue (Old Norse: D√∂nsk Tunga). Most early Scandinavians would however primarily identify themselves with their region of origin. However, the Old Norse term Nordmenn, usually applied for Norwegians, was sometimes applied to all Old Norse speakers. \\"Nor were the Viking raiders as a whole referred to by that name by their contemporaries. The Anglo-Saxons called them all ‚ÄòDanes‚Äô, whichever land they came from; the Franks called them Normanni, ‚ÄòNorthmen‚Äô; the Germans called them ‚ÄòAshmen‚Äô, perhaps in allusion to their ships, though these were in fact made of oak; the Irish called them either Gaill, ‚ÄòForeigners‚Äô, or Loch- lannaighy ‚ÄòNortherners‚Äô, though they also sometimes distinguished between Danes and Norwegians as ‚ÄòBlack Northerners‚Äô and ‚ÄòWhite Northerners‚Äô; Spanish Arabs called them Majus, ‚ÄòHeathens‚Äô; in the east, the Slavs, Arabs and Byzantine Greeks called them Rus or Ros9 which probably was originally a Finnish name for the Swedes. As for the Scandinavians themselves, they usually thought of themselves as inhabitants of a particular region‚Äî‚ÄòMen of Vestfold‚Äô, ‚ÄòMen of Hordaland‚Äô, ‚ÄòMen of the Uplands‚Äô, and so forth‚Äîbut as the sense of national identity grew so too did the use of national names. They also used the term Nordmenn, sometimes in the limited sense ‚ÄòNorwegians‚Äô but more often in the general sense ‚ÄòScandinavians‚Äô; the latter usage has given rise to the general terms ‚ÄòNorthmen‚Äô, ‚ÄòNorsemen‚Äô and ‚ÄòNorse‚Äô in modem English.\\" The modern North Germanic languages have a common word: the word nordbo, (Sw.: nordborna, Da.: nordboerne, No.: nordboerne or nordbuane in the definite plural) which is used for both ancient and modern North Germanic peoples. Exonyms In the early Medieval period, as today, Vikings was a common term for North Germanic raiders, especially in connection with raids and monastic plundering in continental Europe and the British Isles. In modern times the term is often applied to all North Germanic peoples of the Middle Ages, including raiders and non-raiders, although such use is controversial. From the Old Norse language, the term norr≈ìnir menn (northern men), has given rise to the English name Norsemen, which is sometimes used for the pre-Christian North Germanic peoples. In scholarship however, the term Norsemen generally refers only to early Norwegians. The North Germanic peoples were known by many names by those they encountered. They were known as Ascomanni (Ashmen) by the Germans, and Dene (Danes) or heathens by the Anglo-Saxons. \\"The peoples these Scandinavians encountered gave them a variety of names: the Franks normally called them Northmen or Danes, while for the English they were generally Danes or heathens. The Irish described the early raiders as pagans or gentiles, but by the middle of the ninth century they began to call them foreigners, the Norwegians and Danes being distinguished as 'white' and 'black' foreigners, Finngalland DubgalL In eastern Europe the Slavs called the Scandinavian invaders Rus, a word derived trom the Finnish name for the Svear, which itself came from a word meaning 'rowers' or 'crew of oarsmen'. It was 'Rus', variants of which were used in Arabic and Byzantine Greek texts, which eventually gave Russia its name. In the ninth century it was only the English who, occasionally, called the invaders Vikings, a Scandinavian word that now has a wider meaning, and is used to describe many aspects of Scandinavian society in what is commonly called the Age of the Vikings.\\" \\"The people these Scandinavians encountered described them in various ways. In western Europe they were often identified as Danes or Northmen, and were sometimes called heathens or gentiles.\\" The Old Frankish word Nortmann (Northman) was Latinised as Normanni and then entered Old French as Normands, whence the name of the Normans and of Normandy, which was conquered from the Franks by Vikings in the 10th century. The Gaelic terms Finn-Gall (White Foreigner) and Dubh-Gall (Black Foreigner) were used by the Irish for Norwegian and Danish Vikings, respectively. Dubliners called them Ostmen (East-people), and the name Oxmanstown (an area in central Dublin; the name is still current) comes from one of their settlements; they were also known as Lochlannaigh (Lake-people). The Slavs, Finns, Muslims, Byzantines and other peoples of the east knew them as the Rus' or Rh≈çs, probably derived from various uses of r≈ç√æs-, i.e. \\"related to rowing\\", or from the area of Roslagen in east-central Sweden, where most of the Vikings who visited the Slavic lands originated. The Arabs of Spain also knew them as al-Majus (fire-worshippers). After the Rus' established Kievan Rus' and gradually merged with the Slavic population, the North Germanic people in the east become known as Varangians (ON: V√¶ringjar, meaning \\"sworn men\\"), after the bodyguards of the Byzantine known as the Varangian Guard. In modern scholarship, the terms Scandinavians \\"One of the reasons for this is doubtless to be found in the close racial affinity of the Scandinavians, as North Germanics, with the Anglo-Saxons, and in the consciousness of this affinity existing in all modern nationality groups of North Germanic ethnic stock\\" \\"Northern Germanic peoples, i.e. the Scandinavians...\\" \\"North Germanic (Scandinavian) peoples\\" and Norsemen are common synonyms for North Germanic peoples. As such, Scandinavians is generally applied for modern North Germanic peoples, while Norsemen is sometimes applied for pagan pre-modern North Germanic peoples. History Depiction of ancient rituals at the Rock Carvings in Tanum, Nordic Bronze Age Prehistory The Battle Axe culture, a local variant of the Corded Ware culture, which was itself an offshoot of the Yamnaya culture, emerged in southern Scandinavia in the early 3rd millennium BC. Modern-day Scandinavians have been found to carry more ancestry from the Yamnaya culture than any other population in Europe. While previous inhabitants of Scandinavia have been found to be mostly carriers of haplogroup I, the emergence of the Battle Axe culture in Scandinavia is characterized by the appearance of new lineages such as haplogroup R1a and haplogroup R1b. The Proto-Germanic language is ultimately thought to have emerged from the Battle Axe culture, possibly through its superimposition upon the earlier megalithic cultures of the area. The Germanic tribal societies of Scandinavia were thereafter surprisingly stable for thousands of years. Scandinavia is considered the only area in Europe where the Bronze Age was significantly delayed for a whole region. The period was nevertheless characterized by the independent development of new technologies, with the peoples of southern Scandinavia developing a culture with its own characteristics, indicating the emergence of a common cultural heritage. When bronze was finally introduced, its importance was rapidly established, leading to the emergence of the Nordic Bronze Age. The Nordic Bronze Age is closely genetically related to the Beaker and Unetice cultures of Continental Europe, and even the Sintashta and Andronovo cultures of the Eurasian Steppe, with whom it also shares numerous cultural characteristics. Stone slab from The King's Grave in southern Sweden, Nordic Bronze Age, 1400 BC Ancient history The gilded side of the Trundholm Sun Chariot, Nordic Bronze Age During the Iron Age the peoples of Scandinavia were engaged in the export of slaves and amber to the Roman Empire, receiving prestige goods in return. This is attested by artifacts of gold and silver that have been found at rich burials from the period. North Germanic tribes, chiefly Swedes, were probably engaged as middlemen in the slave trade along the Baltic coast between Balts and Slavs and the Roman Empire. The North Germanic tribes at the time were skilled metal and leather workers, which supplemented their trade in iron and amber. In his book Germania, the Roman historian Tacitus mentions the Swedes (Suiones) as being governed by powerful rulers and excelling at seafaring. From a very early time, Germanic tribes are thought to have interacted with and possibly settled in the Baltic states, in which they would leave a profound influence, particularly on the ancient Estonians. \\"Contacts with the Germanic tribes occurred repeatedly in different periods up to historical times. It is thought that the Estonians, or more properly the inhabitants of the Proto-Balto-Finnic settlements in the Estonian area, had contacts with Germanic peoples as early as the Bronze Age. It is not impossible that at that time there were even temporary Germanic settlements on the Estonian shore, although we do not have any definite proof. On the basis of linguistic chronology, the older contacts with the Germanic tribes occur about the beginning of the Christian era or the first centuries A.D. The linguistic data also indicate that these first contacts must have occurred with some Eastern Germanic people, perhaps the Goths who, according to the older school of archeologists, were the original inhabitants of Estonia prior to the Balto-Finns. Contacts are not impossible also with the Northern Germanic peoples, i.e., with the Scandinavians directly across the sea... The Germanic influence is noticeable also in Estonian culture, although it has fused with local traditions. Among the Estonian folklorists, O. Loorits especially has emphasized the influence exercised by the Germanic peoples on the formation of the Estonians' ancient religious concept of the world and their spiritual world, and he feels that there must have been Germanic settlements on Estonian shores to cause such deep influences. Some other phenomena which can be linked with the Eastern Germanic peoples also suggest that Germanic settlements existed on Estonian shores at that time. First of all, a great number of Germanic words came into the Estonian language at that time. This word stock of foreign origin reflects in a characteristic way not only commercial relationships, seafaring, etc., but also closer connections between the Estonians and the Germanic peoples.... [T]his in its turn makes the existence of the Germanic agricultural settlements in Estonia evident.\\" Germanic dialect groups in Europe around the year 1 CE: During the Iron Age various Germanic tribes migrated from Scandinavia to East-Central Europe. This included the Rugii, Goths, Gepids, Vandals, Burgundians and others. \\"From the beginning of history energetic warlike tribes issued from Sweden and passed to a career of conquest in the south; in the phrase of the Gothic historian Jordanes, Sweden was a 'factory of nations' (officina gentium). The migrations of the Burgundians, Goths, and Gepids (preceded perhaps by the Vandals) are the earliest that are known; archaeology dates the coming of the Burgundians to the south shore of the Baltic about 200 B.C.,\\" and the Goths may have begun their southward movement about the same time...\\" The Rugii might have originated in Western Norway (Rogaland). The migrations of most of these tribes is thought to have occurred around 200 BC, though the Vandals might have migrated earlier. According to the historian Procopius, these tribes were distinguished by their height, fair complexion, physical attractiveness and common cultural characteristics, suggesting a common origin. \\"For they all have white bodies and fair hair, and are tall and handsome to look upon, and they use the same laws and practise a common religion. For they are all of the Arian faith, and have one language called Gothic; and, as it seems to me, they all came originally from one tribe, and were distinguished later by the names of those who led each group.\\" Because of the large number of Germanic tribes that traced their origin to Scandinavia, the region became known by Early Medieval historians as the Factory of Nations () or Womb of Nations (). \\"Now from this island of Scandza, as from a hive of races or a womb of nations, the Goths are said to have come forth long ago under their king, Berig by name.\\" The early Germanic tribes that migrated from Scandinavia became speakers of East Germanic dialects. Though these tribes were probably indistinguishable from later North Germanic tribes at the time of their migration, the culture and language of North and East Germanic tribes would thereafter take divergent lines of development. \\"The later expansion of the Scandinavian nations in the viking age may be regarded as the final wave of North Germanic migration; but the process was probably not the same, and the results were essentially different. When the Goths and Burgundians migrated from Scandinavia, the North Germanic peoples spoke a language nearly identical with that of other Germanic nations. After their departure came a period of great linguistic change, when Germanic broke up into distinct groups of dialects; the language of the Goths then became rapidly differentiated from Norse, and their national traditions and culture also took divergent lines of development.\\" Another Germanic tribe which claimed Scandinavian origins were the Lombards. \\"The race of Winnili, that is, of Langobards, which afterwards ruled prosperously in Italy, deducing its origin from the German peoples, came from the island which is called Scadinavia, although other causes of their emigration are also alleged.\\" It is likely that Proto-Norse emerged as a separate Germanic dialect around the 1st century. The ethnogenesis of the North Germanic peoples is thought to have occurred in Sweden. \\"Sweden was the mother of the Scandinavian peoples: from Sweden came both the Danes and the Norwegians. In the early days of Scandinavian expansion Norway was called the nor√≥vegr, just as in later viking times the nor√∞rvegr, just as in later viking times the Baltic lands were the austrvegr. The home of the oldest Norse culture and the oldest Norse traditions was Sweden, though these traditions had to be carried to distant Iceland before they were given an enduring form. Snorri made no mistake when he began his history of the northern nations, Heimskringla, with the legends of ancient Sweden.\\" Sweden was the home of the earliest attestations of North Germanic culture, and the later North Germanic tribes of Norway and Denmark originated in Sweden. Archaeological evidence suggests that the North Germanic tribes at the time constituted one of five main tribal groups among the Germanic peoples, the others being North Sea Germanic tribes (Frisians, Saxons and Angles), Weser-Rhine Germanic tribes (Hessians, Franks), Elbe Germanic tribes (Lombards, Alemanni, Bavarians) and Oder-Vistula Germanic tribes (Goths, Vandals, Burgundians). \\"For the period when the existence of the Germanic tribes is first clearly recorded by Roman writers, archaeological evidence suggests five tribal groups, with perhaps five incipient distinct Germanic languages, as follows: (1) North Germanic tribes (Scandinavians)...\\" The Royal Mounds at Gamla Uppsala contains hundreds (originally thousands) of tumuli, some of them dating back to the Nordic Bronze Age. The southward expansion of the East Germanic tribes pushed many other Germanic and Iranian peoples towards the Roman Empire, spawning the Marcomannic Wars in the 2nd century AD. Another East Germanic tribe were the Herules, who according to 6th century historian Jordanes were driven from modern-day Denmark by the Danes, who were an offshoot of the Swedes. \\"Somewhat later was the migration of the Heruli, who were driven out by the southward advance of the Danes in Sweden. After centuries of wandering, The Heruli were overwhelmed by the Lombards, and the remnant of them returned to their old home in south Sweden, about a.d. 510. \\" The migration of the Herules is thought to have occurred around 250 AD. The Danes would eventually settle all of Denmark, with many its former inhabitants, including the Jutes and Angles, settling Britain, becoming known as the Anglo-Saxons. \\"North Germanic speakers, originally at home in southern Sweden and Norway, moved into Denmark very late in the prehistoric period and repopulated an area that was largely depopulated by the movement of the original West Germanic speakers to the British Isles.\\" The Old English story Beowulf is a testimony to this connection. \\"THE NORTH GERMANIC TRIBES\\" Meanwhile, Norway was inhabited by a large number of North Germanic tribes and divided into a score of petty kingdoms. The 5th century Golden Horns of Gallehus carry Proto-Norse inscriptions in Elder Futhark Among the early North Germanic peoples, kinship ties played an important role in social organization. Society was divided into three classes, chieftains, free men and slaves (thralls). Free men were those who owned and farmed the land. Religious leaders, merchants, craftsmen and armed retainers of chieftains (housecarls) were not confined to any specific class. Women had considerable independence compared to other parts of Europe. Legislative and judicial power lay in the hands of the free men at a popular assembly known as the Thing. Their legal system was closely related to those of other Germanic peoples. Dwellings were built according to methods that had changed little since the neolithic. A chieftain typically had his seat of power in a mead hall, where lavish feasts for his followers were held. Merchants frequently operated through joint financial ventures, and some legal disputes were solved through single combat. Men of prominence were generally buried along with their most prized possessions, including horses, chariots, ships, slaves and weapons, which were supposed to follow them into the afterlife. Iron Age oak boat discovered at Nydam Mose in S√∏nderborg, Denmark. Vendel Period helmet, at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities Though the economy was primarily based on farming and trade, the North Germanic tribes practiced a warrior culture similar to related Germanic peoples and the ancient Celts. Warfare was generally carried out in small war bands, whose cohesiveness generally relied upon the loyalty between warriors and their chiefs. Loyalty was considered a virtue of utmost importance in early North Germanic society. A fabled elite group of ferocious North Germanic warriors were the berserkers. The North Germanic tribes of these period also excelled at shipbuilding and maritime warfare. The North Germanic tribes practiced Norse paganism, a branch of Germanic paganism, which ultimately stems from Proto-Indo-European religion. Religion was typically practiced at hallowed outdoor sites, but there is also reference to temples, where sacrifices were held. The best known of these was the Temple at Uppsala. Their art was intimately intertwined with their religion. Their stories and myths were typically inscribed on runestones or transmitted orally by skalds. According to North Germanic belief, those who died in battle gained admittance to Folkvang, Freya's Hall, and above all to Valhalla, a majestic hall presided over by Odin, ruler of Asgard according to their cosmology and the chief god in the North Germanic pantheon. Runes, the Germanic form of writing, was associated with Odin and magic. \\"Runes, the early form of writing among the North Germanic tribes, were often involved in magic and were associated with the great god Woden.\\" The thunder god Thor was popular with the North Germanic common people. \\"His [Thor's] figure was generally secondary to that of Odin, who in some traditions was his father; but in Iceland, and perhaps among all North Germanic peoples except the royal families, he was apparently worshiped more than any other god\\" The Oseberg ship at the Viking Ship Museum in Oslo, Norway By the 3rd century there seems to have been a disruption of trade, possibly due to attacks from tribes in periphery. In the 4th and 5th centuries, larger settlements were established in southern Scandinavia, indicating a centralization of power. Numerous strongholds were also being built, indicating a need to defend against attacks. Deposits of weapons in bogs from this period suggest the presence of a warrior aristocracy. The Gutes of Gotland are in later Old Norse literature considered indistinguishable from the Goths, who in the 3rd and 4th centuries wrested control of the Pontic Steppe from the Iranian nomads. The Goths were the only non-nomadic people to ever acquire a dominant position on the Eurasian steppe, and their influence on the early Slavs must have been considerable. \\"During the second or third century A.D. the Sarmatian hordes were driven out by the German Goths and Heruli. The Gothic dominion lasted over two centuries, and is the only non- nomadic episode in the history of the steppe. The Goths were the most magnificent German people, and their influence on the Slavs must have been enormous. When the Huns invaded these territories, the North Germanic legends recall that the Gizur of the Geats came to the aid of the Goths in an epic conflict. Rich Eastern Roman finds made in Gotland and southern Sweden from this period are a testimony to this connection. Archaeological evidence suggest that a warrior elite continued to dominate North Germanic society into the Early Middle Ages. The royal dynasty of the Swedes, the Yngling, was founded in the 5th century. Based at Gamla Uppsala, the Ynglings would come to dominate much of Scandinavia. The importance of this dynasty for the North Germanic peoples is attested by the fact that the later Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson begins his history of the Norse peoples, the Heimskringla, with the legends of ancient Sweden. Early Middle Ages Around 510, the Herules returned to their home in southern Sweden following centuries of migrations throughout Europe, after their kingdom had been overwhelmed by the Lombards. Their name has been connected to the word erilaz attested in Elder Futhark inscriptions and the title Earl. In his book Getica, the 6th century Gothic historian Jordanes presents a detailed description of the various peoples inhabiting Scandinavia (Scandza), a land \\"not only inhospitable to men but cruel even to wild beasts.\\" Jordanes wrote that the Scandinavians were distinguished from other Germanic peoples by being of larger physical stature and more warlike. The most numerous of these tribes were the Swedes and the Danes, who were an offshoot of the Swedes. Another North Germanic tribe were the Ranii, whose king Rodulf left Scandinavia for Ostrogothic Italy and became a companion of Theoderic the Great. As early as the 6th century, the North Germanic tribes were actively engaged in naval raids on Continental Europe. Between 512 and 520, as attested in the Royal Frankish Annals and Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf, Hygelac, King of the Geats, made a great raid in the Rhineland. Carrying off great booty, Hygelac was defeated and killed before he could return to Scandinavia. Before the 7th century AD, Norwegian seafarers had settled Shetland. \\"There is evidence of early viking activity among the Scandinavian peoples, as among the other seafaring Germans: it is known from Frankish annals and the AngloSaxon poem Beowulf, for example, that between 512 and 520 Hugleik, King of the Gautar in the south of Sweden, made a raid on the Rhineland, where he took great booty, but was defeated and killed before he could carry it off. And Norwegian vikings had made settlements in the Shetlands before 700.\\" During this time the Frisians were the foremost rivals of the Scandinavians for naval supremacy in the North Sea. \\"The destruction by Charlemagne of the naval power of the Frisians, once the rivals of the Norsemen on the sea, coincided with the rise of Scandinavian power, and probably played an important part in facilitating the Scandinavian advance.\\" By the 8th century, the Swedes, by far the most advanced of the North Germanic peoples, had established colonial settlements in Estonia, Latvia and the southern shores of Lake Ladoga and Lake Onega in Russia. \\"In the eighth century the difference between Denmark and Norway on the one hand and Sweden on the other was that Sweden was already an organized and ancient kingdom (based on Uppland), strong enough to engage in colonial expansion beyond its frontiers. These extensions of its territory were partly into Latvia and Estonia, and partly farther eastwards towards the southern shores of Lakes Ladoga and Onega.\\" \\"Around 750, a small settlement was established at Staraia Ladoga... Traders and raiders from Scandinavia had visited the shores of the south-eastern Baltic and Lake Ladoga for some time before this, and some had even established settlements in what are today Estonia and Latvia.\\" The settlement of Grobi≈Üa in Latvia and the Salme ships of Saaremaa, Estonia, are testimony to this expansion. In this period the entire eastern Baltic Sea came to be dominated by a homogenous warrior culture derived from Sweden, in which Old Norse served as the lingua franca. \\"Coastal Estonia and the western and south-western coasts of Finland (including the √Öland archipelago), as well as Livic areas in present-day Latvia, Karelia, and certain areas on the coast of the eastern end of the Finnish Gulf and Lake Ladoga, as well as Gotland and central Sweden, on the other hand, demonstrated an archaeologially very homogenous warrior culture, which can be observed as early as the 7th-8th centuries... Originally Scandinavian artefact types, ornament styles, grave forms, but presumably also attitued, stories, and legends, were taken over in these neighbouring coastal zones, adapted in local culture, and developed further locally... This was a multi-ethnic, mainly Eastern Scandinavian - Baltic-Finnic-based mileu, where however, the means of expression were borrowed from Sweden, and where self-identity probably relied greatly on Scandinavian values. The latter suggests that the lingua franca used in this mileu was presumably the eastern dialect of Old Norse, or perhaps a kind of pidgin Scandinavia based on Old Norse and Baltic Finnic.\\" Viking Age Map showing area of Norse settlements during the Viking Age, including Norman conquests In the late 8th century North Germanic tribes embarked on a massive expansion in all the directions. This was the start of the Viking Age, which lasted until 1066 AD. This expansion is considered the last of the great North Germanic migrations. These seafaring traders, settlers and warriors are commonly referred to as Vikings. \\"For reasons of convenience, modern scholarship calls both sorts of Scandinavians 'Vikings', thereby blurring the distinction. Furthermore, there is another mistaken tendency to identify the 'Northmen' or 'Norsemen' with modern Norway, and the 'Danes' with modern Denmark. This is not appropriate for the simple reason that in the period in question the separate Scandinavian nations of Norwegians, Danes, and Swedes had not yet come into existence. The Viking appellation, therefore, needs to be glossed. It refers to an activity, not to an ethnic group... Ottar belonged to a group of peoples who were beginning to have a huge impact on European history.They are now called 'Scandinavians', though historically they were called 'Northmen.\\" \\"‚ÄúViking‚Äù is a term used to describe a certain class of marauding Scandinavian warrior from the 8th through the 11th century. However, when discussing the entire culture of the northern Germanic peoples of the early Middle Ages, and especially in terms of the languages and literatures of these peoples, it would be more accurate to use the term ‚ÄúNorse.‚Äù Therefore during the Middle Ages and beyond, it therefore might be useful to speak of ‚ÄúGerman‚Äù peoples in middle Europe and of ‚ÄúNorse‚Äù peoples in Scandinavia and the North Atlantic.\\" \\"Some of the Vikings were Swedes, some Norwegian, and some Danes, but they were all North Germanic people who spoke much the same language and whose social and cultural patterns of behavior were very much alike\\" \\"The North Germanic peoples were quite expansive from the time of the Vikings (from about 800 A.D.)\\" \\"The Northern Germanic pirates known as Vikings mostly spoke varieties of Old Norse; for reasons that are still unclear, in the late eighth century these Norsemen began a series of raids that soon grew into a scourge as they ravaged and terrified any part of Europe that was reachable by boat.\\" \\"Vikings (who were Northern Germanic tribes, i.e., \\"Teutons\\" in the old nomenclature)...\\" The North Germanic peoples of the Viking Age as a whole are sometimes referred to as Norsemen. \\"The Northmen, Norsemen, or Norse were North Germanic peoples who settled in the Scandinavian countries of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark\\" \\"Here we are concerned exclusively with the Northern Germanic peoples...\\" \\"North Germanic peoples, or the Northmen as we can more fitly describe them \\"Towards the end of the Anglo- Saxon period, large numbers of North Germanic (Norse) peoples settled in northern England. \\"Who were the Norse people?

Though the early Scandinavians did not have an ethnonym for themselves, they certainly had a common identity, which has survived among their descendants up to the present day. The cause of this expansion is often thought to have been overpopulation. \\"Parts of Scandinavia must have been over-populated, to judge from the never- ending stream of men that came forth from those lands; in viking life mortality was high, but there was never any lack of men to replace those killed. The hypothesis of over-population is strengthened by such legends as that told in selection xxi, according to which the island of Gotland became crowded, and one man of every three was selected by lot and sent away from the island ; and Saxo Grammaticus has a similar story of the origin of the Danish settlements on Baltic lands in the tenth century. Over-population, moreover, is the explanation of viking activity given by the early Norman his- torians, Dudo and William of Jumieges.\\" Other explanations include political tensions, disruption of trade with the Abbasid Caliphate, or vengeance against massacres committed against the pagan Saxons by the Carolingian Empire. The prospect of a Carolingian invasion of Denmark itself created much fear and resentment among the Scandinavians. \\"An immediate cause of many of the early raids was the fear and resentment roused in the Scandinavians by Charlemagne's military operations in the north of Germany, especially as he threatened to invade Denmark.\\" The destruction of the naval powers of the Frisians by Charlemagne in the 8th century also probably played a key role in facilitating the naval dominance of the Scandinvians. The centralization of power that was carried out by Harald Fairhair and other powerful Scandinavian rulers drove many warlike men into exile abroad. \\"Great political changes, too, in the ninth century drove many Norsemen into exile, who then took up a viking career. Harald Fairhair exiled many great fighting men in the process of consolidating the realm of Norway; and the struggles of rival princes for the throne of Denmark drove bands of followers abroad, as one or other of the claimants got the upper hand.\\" By this time North Germanic military units were typically larger than in previous centuries. \\"The true Scandinavian expansion, when distinctively Norse traditions and speech were carried to other lands, belongs to the viking period, which may be roughly dated from 750 to 1050. During this period bands of Scandinavian adventurers , sometimes in forces large enough to be called armies, sailed overseas in search of plunder, or to win land for settlement; these piratical adventurers were called vikings.\\" During this time the North Germanic peoples spoke Old Norse. \\"Norse was the language spoken by the North Germanic peoples (Scandinavians) from the time when Norse first became differentiated from the speech of the other Germanic peoples, that is, roughly, from about 1oo, until about 1500.\\" \\"\\"Old Norse\\" was spoken by the North Germanic or Scandinavian peoples\\" \\"The North Germanic tribes spoke a language we now call Old Norse, the ancestor of the modern Scandinavian languages\\" The Piraeus Lion of Piraeus, Greece, contains an 11th-century inscription made by a member of the Varangian Guard The Vikings raided and settled various parts in the British Isles, in particular the area around the Irish Sea and Scotland, where they became known as the Norse‚ÄìGaels. The U√≠ √çmair dynasty acquired a prominent position among these Scandinavians, establishing the Kingdom of the Isles. These Vikings, mostly Norwegians, came close to completely conquering Ireland until they were defeated by the Irish at the Battle of Clontarf. They would nevertheless remain firmly established in Ireland for generations afterwards, in particular the cities of Dublin, Waterford and Limerick. In the 9th century, Danish Vikings gained control of a part of eastern England, which became known as the Danelaw. England was the part of Europe most heavily subjected to Viking attacks, and it is likely that the Scandinavians would have gained control of all of England if not for the successful resistance of Alfred the Great. In the early 11th century, England temporarily became part of the North Sea Empire of Danish king Cnut the Great from 1016 to 1042. Vikings were also active in both east and west Francia. There were extensive raids in the Rhineland, and Hamburg was burned in 845. In the early 10th century, a group of Vikings under the leadership of Rollo settled in Rouen, France, and established the Duchy of Normandy. The descendants of these Vikings, known as the Normans, would in the 11th century conquer England, Southern Italy, and North Africa, and play a leading role in launching the Crusades. Sub-groups of the Normans include Anglo-Normans, Scoto-Normans, Cambro-Normans, Hiberno-Normans and Italo-Normans. Some Vikings raided in Spain, and sailed through the Strait of Gibraltar and pillaged the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea. In the east the Danish Viking were active in raiding the Wends. The most famous colonies created by these Vikings was Jomsborg in modern Pomerania, which became the base of the Jomsvikings. Ruins of the Hvalsey Church at Hvalsey, Greenland The Swedes were particularly active in Eastern Europe, where they were known as the Rus'. They were engaged in extensive trade with the Byzantine Empire and the Abbasid Caliphate, launching raids on Constantinople and expeditions in the Caspian Sea. The Rus' are described in detail by the Arab traveller Ahmad ibn Fadlan, who described them as tall, blond and the most \\"perfect physical specimens\\" he had ever seen. \\"I have seen the Rus as they came on their merchant journeys and encamped by the Atil (Itil, Volga). I have never seen more perfect physical specimens, tall as date palms, blond and ruddy...\\" In the 9th century, the Viking Rurik is believed to have founded the Rurik dynasty, which eventually developed into Kievan Rus'. The North Germanic elite of this state were known as the Rus'. In the 10th century, the Rus', in cooperation with surviving Crimean Goths, destroyed the Khazar Khaganate and emerged as the dominant power in Eastern Europe. By the 11th century, the Rus' had converted to Eastern Orthodoxy and were gradually merging with the local East Slavic population, becoming known as the Russians. The North Germanic diaspora in the area were thereafter called Varangians. Many of them served in the Varangian Guard, the personal bodyguard of the Byzantine emperors. Among the prominent Scandinavians who served in the Varangian Guard were Norwegian king Harald Hardrada. While the Danes and Swedes were active in Francia and Russia respectively, North Germanic tribes from Norway were actively exploring the North Atlantic. These Vikings were the first sailors in naval history to venture out into the open sea. \\"The final stage of Norse expansion in the west, the colonization of Greenland (which led to the discovery of America) was accomplished by notable feats of seamanship. These feats, moreover, afford striking illustration of the Norsemen‚Äôs great contribution to navigation: they were the first people who ventured to sail out to open sea. Before viking seafarers appear in history, voyagers were careful to follow courses that were never far from land; but the Norsemen struck boldly across the North Sea to the Orkneys and Shetlands, and they voyaged regularly across the open Atlantic to Iceland. These voyages were made in open boats; some ships had a small cabin at either end, but many had no deck or shelter of any kind. The hardships of voyages across the open sea in such ships must have been intense, but the Norsemen endured them habitually.\\" This initially resulted in the colonization of the Shetland Islands, Orkney Islands, the Faroese Islands and Iceland. The most important Norse colony was the settlement in Iceland, which became a haven for Scandinavians who sought to preserve their traditional way of life and independence of central authority. \\"The first settler in Iceland was the Norwegian Ingolf, who came in 874. 1 He was soon followed by many of the exiled chiefs whom Harald had driven from Norway and the Scottish isles-; they were indeed the larger part of the settlement. They were men who were determined to keep their old freedom at all costs, and preferred to give up their possessions and live in a wild and barren land rather than yield to the new monarchy. They came to Iceland to save the old order of heroic society, and they preserved it there much as it had existed in early Germanic times before the great kings made their power absolute by destroying the free fellowship of the small lord and his men. The settlers of Iceland were men of more than usual force of will and love of liberty, the best of the Norwegian aristocracy The proportion of well-born men there was greater than in any other Scandinavian land, and it was in the gentleman√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s household that the literary arts were practised most. Half or more than half of the literary power of Norway was thus concentrated in Iceland, and it throve the more for its concentration.\\" The literary heritage of the Icelanders is indispensable for the modern understanding of early North Germanic history and culture. \\"In the eyes of the literary historian the most important of the Norse colonies is Iceland ; for in Iceland was written the greater part of Old Norse literature that survives today, and almost all that is of merit.\\" In the late 10th century, the Icelandic explorer Erik the Red discovered Greenland and supervised the Norse settlement of the Iceland. His son Leif later made the first documented trans-oceanic voyage in history and thereafter supervised the attempted Norse colonization of North America. \\"The Greenland settlers and their descendants were intrepid voyagers and explorers. Eirlk‚Äôs son Leif sailed across the Atlan- tic to Scotland on his way to Norway, making the first trans- oceanic voyage known in history. And the Greenlanders also reached America ; no one who is acquainted with the historical value of Norse tradition can doubt it.\\" Later history Scandinavist poster image of (from left to right) Norwegian, Danish and Swedish soldiers joining hands While Vikings were raiding the rest of Europe, their own Scandinavian homeland was undergoing increasing centralization. This is evidenced by the number of larger settlements being built. Some of these settlements became seats for royal mints and bishoprics. By the mid-11th century, the North Germanic tribes had been converted from paganism to Christianity and were under the rule of centralized states. These states were the kingdoms of Norway, Sweden and Denmark. \\"These Langobards thus lived south of the Angles and east of the Saxons, and were somewhat removed from the North Germanic people of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway\\" The Scandinavian settlements in Greenland disappeared in the 15th century. Modern North Germanic ethnic groups are the Danes, Faroese people, Icelanders, \\"[Icelanders] dwell chiefly by the shores of the ocean, and in the river valleys which open towards the sea. They belong for the greater part to the North Germanic race (Norsemen) Norwegians \\"Some 86 percent of the people living in Norway today are ethnic Norwegians, a North Germanic people\\" and Swedes. \\"Similarly homogenous are the countries of China (with 92% Han Chinese) and Korea, as well as Scandinavia, in particular Sweden (where more than 95% belong to the North Germanic people of the Swedes. Iceland, which is even more homogeneous, was settled by the Vikings almost a thousand years ago, has remained unspoilt by outsiders ever since, and is now comprised almost exclusively of Icelanders in the ethnic sense.)\\" \\"The word Nordic is used to suggest the racial origin of the peoples of Northern and Northwestern Europe. The word Germanic denotes their linguistic and cultural unity. The main divisions of Germanic are: 1. East Germanic, including the Goths, both Ostrogoths and Visigoths. 2. North Germanic, including the Scandinavians, Danes, Icelanders, Swedes, \\"Norsemen.\\" 3. West Germanic. The Old English (Anglo-Saxons) belong to this division, of which the continental representatives are the Teutonic peoples, High and Low Franks and Saxons, Alemanni, etc. English and German are both West Germanic languages. Care should be taken not to confuse Germanic and German. Germcm (Deutsch) is the literary language of the High German division of the Teutonic dialects. \\"Germanic\\" (Germanisch) is a generic term covering all that is included in East, North and West Germanic.\\" \\"The Germanic peoples were of course in no way particularly identified with the territory covered by modern Germany; they stretched from southern Russia, where the Goths were settled in the fourth century, when they first came to grips with Roman power, to Iceland, which was settled mainly by Norwegians in the ninth century. The usual subdivisions are: North-Germanic, comprising the Danes, Swedes, Norwegians, and Icelanders; West- Germanic, mainly English (Anglo-Saxon), Dutch, and German; East- Germanic, Goths, Vandals, and Burgundians. These subdivisions have been established rather on the basis of language than of geographical location, yet, roughly speaking, the results of the two classifications coincide.\\" \\"The North Germanic, or Scandinavian group, consists of the Norwegians, Danes, Swedes, and Icelanders.

North Germanic peoples are sometimes called Nordic peoples by historians. \\"Ethnically they were of Germanic origin. They spoke a North Germanic tongue, best described as Scandinavian or Old Norse.

In the Late Middle Ages, the countries most associated with North Germanic cultures were briefly united under the Kalmar Union. With the rise of romantic nationalism in the 19th century, many prominent figures throughout Scandinavia became adherents of Scandinavism, which called for the unification of all North Germanic lands. Both during the First Schleswig War and the Second Schleswig War between Denmark and Germany in the 19th century, large numbers of Swedes fought for Denmark to counter a perceived German threat against the North Germanic peoples. \\"In 1848-9 Sweden sent troops to Funen with the intention of fighting Germany, and in 1864 Swedes streamed into Denmark in order to prevent the danger threatening the North Germanic peoples.\\" In Norway, on the other hand, many prominent public figures disregarded Scandinavism in favour of Pan-Germanism, seeking to create a Pan-Germanic state in unity with Germanic nations in Continental Europe and the British Isles. As Pan-Germanism lost currency after the trauma of World War II, the North Germanic countries and Finland have in the post-war era cooperated through the Nordic Council.

Compared to other work in attachment, the DMM emphasizes the organized self-protective function of attachment strategies (rather than disorganization) and the advantages of adaptation to dangerous circumstances (rather than security). The DMM describes self-protective strategies and patterns of information processing in greater detail than any other attachment-informed model. Crittenden developed an interlocking set of scientific assessments of attachment across the lifespan. The DMM is usable in research, forensic and clinical settings. Crittenden obtained her Ph.D. at the University of Virginia under the supervision of Mary Ainsworth. She has served on various University faculties internationally, and published five books and over 100 research journal articles. She is the founder of the Family Relations Institute and currently serves as its lead instructor and Director of Research and Publication, and serves as a member of the Board of Directors for the International Association for the Study of Attachment. Her most well known work is Raising Parents: Attachment, Representation, and Treatment (2nd edition, 2016, Routledge). Early study with Ainsworth The Strange Situation Procedure was first used by Ainsworth and Wittig (1969) to assess individual differences in the responses of 56 middle-class non-clinical infants aged 11 months to the departure of a caregiver. Infants classified as Secure (type B) used the caregiver as a safe base from which to explore, protested at their departure but sought the caregiver upon his or her return. Infants classified as Anxious-Avoidant (A) did not exhibit distress on separation, and ignored the caregiver on their return. Separation of an infant from her caregiver was theorised by Bowlby (1960) to necessarily evoke anxiety, as a reaction hard- wired by evolution since the infant cannot survive without the caregiver. Hence the apparently unruffled behaviour of the type A infants was understood by Ainsworth as a mask for distress, a point later evidenced through studies of heart-rate (Sroufe & Waters 1977). Infants classified as Anxious- Ambivalent/Resistant (C), showed distress on separation, and were clingy and difficult to comfort on the caregiver's return. A set of protocols for classifying infants into one of these groups was established by Ainsworth's influential Patterns of Attachment (Ainsworth et al. 1978). Crittenden was a doctoral student of Mary Ainsworth in the early 1980s. Two surprising findings faced Ainsworth's doctoral students. The first surprising finding was that Ainsworth's ABC classification of infant behaviour in the Strange Situation Procedure appeared to account for the overwhelming majority of middle-class infants. Crittenden (1995: 368) and other students of Ainsworth were therefore brought to ask: ‚ÄòWhy are there only three patterns of attachment when mothers are highly varied?‚Äô.Crittenden, P.M. (1995). Attachment and psychopathology. In S. Goldberg, R. Muir & J. Kerr (Eds.) John Bowlby‚Äôs Attachment Theory: Historical, clinical and social significance, (pp.367-406) NY: Analytical Press. The fact that these three patterns appeared so widely suggested that, on the one hand, the activation of the attachment system when an infant is anxious appeared to be an innate psycho-physiological mechanism. On the other hand, this finding implied that the quality of the attachment behaviour elicited by this anxiety differed in systematic ways as a function of the infant's caregiving environment. A second surprising finding that confronted Ainsworth's students, however, was that not all infants could be classified using Ainsworth's 1978 protocols for classifying infant behaviour in the Strange Situation. This was especially the case with children from maltreatment samples, but it also occurred in samples of infants from middle- class homes. Bowlby and information processing The founder of Attachment Theory, John Bowlby, had argued that ‚Äògiven certain adverse circumstances during childhood, the selective exclusion of information of certain sorts may be adaptive. Yet, when during adolescence and adult the situation changes, the persistent exclusion of the same forms of information may become maladaptive‚Äô.Bowlby, J. (1980) Loss, London: Penguin, p. 45 This was an important foundation for Crittenden's ideas. Her first study, supervised by Ainsworth, was of 73 infants and toddlers. Most of this sample had experienced severe maltreatment. Like Ainsworth's previous doctoral students, Crittenden found that ‚Äònot all infants can be placed easily into the three categories described above‚Äô; she proposed that the Avoidant (A) and Ambivalent/Resistant (C) responses can be regarded as excluding ‚Äòsome classes of information‚Äô relevant to ‚Äòthe activation of the attachment system‚Äô.Crittenden, P.M. (1983), Mother and Infant Patterns of Attachment. Unpublished PhD Dissertation, University of Virginia, May 1983, p. 14-15, 18. Crittenden worked from ‚Äòa basic premise of ethology ‚Äì that universal behaviours often serve functions that promote survival‚Äô. She proposed that the basic components of human experience of danger are two kinds of information: 1\\\\. Emotions provoked by the potential for danger, such as anger or fear. Crittenden terms this ‚Äòaffective information‚Äô. In childhood this information would include emotions provoked by the unexplained absence of an attachment figure. 2\\\\. Causal or other sequentially ordered knowledge about the potential for safety or danger. In childhood this would include knowledge regarding the behaviours that indicate an attachment figure's availability as a secure haven. Patterns of attachment as splits in information For Crittenden, Secure (B) infants utilise both kinds of information with little distortion: they respond to the caregiver's cues, and can communicate their distress, but also gain comfort when this is available. They can balance their knowledge of causal contingencies and their knowledge of their feelings. By contrast, Crittenden proposes that both kinds of information can be split off from consciousness or behavioural expression as a ‚Äòstrategy‚Äô to maintain the availability of an attachment figure. The term ‚Äòstrategy‚Äô is used by Crittenden, not in ‚Äòthe narrow sense of a cognitive plan, that is, a response to an articulated problem preceded by a conscious analysis of behavioural alternatives‚Äô, but as a transformation of information regarding danger that occurs without conscious thought. Crittenden theorised that infants using an Avoidant strategy split off emotional information about distress. Splitting off emotional information allows an infant facing insensitive caregiving to simplify the complexity of the situation with the neurological means at their disposal: they \\"avoid\\" expressing negative emotions when they are anxious, and in doing so avoid antagonising or alienating their attachment figure. By contrast, infants using an Ambivalent/Resistant strategy split off temporally-sequenced knowledge about how and why the attachment figure is available. If such information is ignored, then the infant becomes focused on pre-empting the unknown availability of the caregiver, and seeking to keep the attention of their caregiver through clingy or aggressive behaviour, or alternating combinations of the two. Ambivalent/Resistant behaviour may increase the availability of an attachment figure who otherwise displays inconsistent or misleading responses to the infant's attachment behaviours, suggesting the unreliability of protection and safety.Crittenden, P. (2008) Raising Parents, London: Routledge In her study, Crittenden noted that the infants who had experienced both abuse and neglect in her sample tended to ‚Äòshow an A/C pattern as do a few who are only abused and also a few who only neglected‚ÄôCrittenden, P.M. (1983), Mother and Infant Patterns of Attachment. Unpublished PhD Dissertation, University of Virginia, May 1983, p.71. Yet Crittenden also observed some infants who did not fit well into an A, B, C or A/C classification; they did not appear able to effectively manage their behaviour in the service of maintaining the availability of their caregiver in the Strange Situation Procedure. For instance, instead of an attachment pattern, one abused infant showed 'stress- related stereotypic headcocking throughout the strange situation. This pervasive behaviour, however, was the only clue to the extent of her stress‚Äô.; This is a point Crittenden has returned to in her later work. She has emphasised that trauma may result in behaviour which is not well adapted to the present. By ‚Äòtrauma‚Äô, Crittenden refers to the psychological experience of emotionally or physically threatening circumstances that cannot be subjected to effective information processing. This information-processing perspective emphasises that children are especially vulnerable to trauma: they are ‚Äòless able to understand‚Äô the meaning of experiences of danger than adults and ‚Äòless able to store, retrieve, and integrate‚Äô the meanings they do receive.Crittenden, P.M. & Landini, A. (2011) Assessing Adult Attachment: A Dynamic-Maturational Approach to Discourse Analysis, NY: W.W. Norton, p.250. Changes with development Though termed 'insecure', Crittenden councils that the Avoidant (A) and Ambivalent/Resistant (C) strategies should not be regarded as in themselves disordered or problematic, so long as they are not misapplied over time through too general an application to situations where they are inappropriate. She emphasises that a strategy may well change over time as the child matures and circumstances change. As a result, ‚Äòa given pathway may continue straight or may branch in ways that may lead to other pathways‚Äô .Crittenden, P.M. (1997b). Truth, error, omission, distortion, and deception: The application of attachment theory to the assessment and treatment of psychological disorder. In S. M. C. Dollinger and L.F. DiLalla (Eds.) Assessment and Intervention Across the Lifespan, (pp.35-76), Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum, p.51 Crittenden suggests that one developmental pathway, particularly in the context of danger, is likely to be towards pathology. Whilst Ainsworth had discovered a universal distinction in human emotion regulation between Secure (B), Avoidance (A) and Ambivalence/Resistance (C), in her later work Crittenden develops the idea of A and C as dimensions. She identifies progressive subtypes of each, running from A1-A8 and C1-C8. The higher numbers represent splits in information about emotions or causality applied more regularly and insistently.Crittenden, P. (2008) Raising Parents, London: Routledge Wilcox and Baim offer a good description of these two dimensions: \\"Development of the ‚ÄòA‚Äô Strategy ‚Äì Predictability with Lack of Attunement\\" If the baby‚Äôs care is predictable but not attuned, she will develop a markedly different attachment style. When she cries, this baby may be consistently ignored, handled roughly or even physically abused. She will soon withhold such emotional expression because this increases her distress. She learns, ‚ÄòWhen I feel bad, no one helps, and when I cry I feel worse.‚Äô Since this child is growing up in a predictable environment, she learns behavioural consequences, recognising that thinking ‚Äì in particular, about cause and effect ‚Äì is critical to survival. This child becomes cognitively organised, and prioritises her thoughts over her feelings knowing that thinking protects her and displaying negative emotions endangers her. She will come to distrust her own emotions ‚Äì even those which arise when there is perceived threat or danger. However, this child's emotions ‚Äì particularly those which are survival oriented (fear, anger and need for comfort) still boil away under the surface, and may periodically burst through in sudden episodes of aggression, distress or comfort seeking (which can include sexualised behaviour). As she grows, she becomes more neurobiologically capable of distancing herself from her felt emotions. In toddlerhood, she may develop a caretaking strategy to gain proximity to a psychologically unavailable parent or she may develop a compulsively compliant strategy to appease a predictably abusive or demanding parent. From puberty onwards, the ‚ÄòA‚Äô strategy may also incorporate promiscuity (to meet needs for comfort without risking closeness) or isolation and self-reliance (to avoid risk of being hurt). \\"Development of the ‚ÄòC‚Äô Strategy ‚Äì Unpredictability with Variable Attunement\\" The ‚ÄòC‚Äô pattern develops when the baby has a carer who is unpredictable and inconsistently attuned. Her carer sometimes responds well and sometimes not. There are many reasons why a carer may be unpredictable, including distractibility, substance misuse, domestic violence or psychological illness. This inconsistency is very confusing for the baby. Her crying, anger or clinginess does not always produce the desired response and she cannot predict when or how her carer will react. This baby learns that her negative emotions when exaggerated are more likely to get results so she becomes affectively organised, trusting and prioritising her feelings over her thoughts. Consequently, tears become wildly exaggerated, sadness inconsolable and expressed anger a temper tantrum. Her strategy becomes acting out to gain her carer's attention. This confuses her carer, who is unaware that their inconsistency worsens the child's behaviour. Moreover, the child learns that to get her needs met she must not only first get her caregiver's attention, she then must hold it. This is the essence of the ‚ÄòC‚Äô pattern, which is a twofold strategy: first, exaggerate my feelings of sadness, fear or anger, and then keep changing the problem. When the ‚ÄòC‚Äô pattern is firmly established, typically by toddlerhood, both carer and child can descend into misery together. As with the ‚ÄòA‚Äô strategy, a child employing a ‚ÄòC‚Äô strategy will, as she develops, have the potential to become more subtle and complex in using the strategy. Typically, in childhood, aggressive outbursts will be counterpoised with displays of helplessness or coy behaviour that disarms potential retaliation. This has the effect of keeping the attachment figure locked in an irresolvable struggle, as the child continually switches between anger/aggression and appeasement/comfort seeking to maintain the carer's attention. From puberty onwards, the ‚ÄòC‚Äô strategy may develop into aggressive strategies that are focused on revenge and punishing the other person, and/or seeking to be rescued by the other person.\\"Wilcox, D. & Baim, C. (2015) 'Applications of the Dynamic-Maturational Model of Attachment with Children Involved in Care and Family Proceedings' Child Abuse Review Yet Crittenden also emphasises that development and time may lead away from pathology. A toddler may have come to depend upon a type C strategy of tantrums in aiming to maintain the availability of an attachment figure whose inconsistent availability has led the child to distrust or distort causal information about their apparent behaviour. This may lead their attachment figure to get a clearer grasp on their needs and the appropriate response to their attachment behaviours. Experiencing more reliable and predictable information about the availability of their attachment figure, the toddler then no longer needs to use coercive behaviours with the goal of maintaining their caregiver‚Äôs availability.Crittenden, P. (2008) Raising Parents, London: Routledge Not only with time can relationships change (e.g. within the family system), but new relationships occur throughout development, and may be the basis for a change of attachment pattern if a relationship is formed with this figure, or if they cause the person to rethink how and whether they seek comfort. Such a new relationship may be with a clinician or other professional, so long as this encounter is not too fleeting.

Historical Introduction  Mendel‚Äôs experimental results on law of segregation and independent assortment ( presented in 1865 and published in 1866 in the Proceedings of the Brunn Society of Natural History) has led founding stone in genetical studies in plants and humans. The studies were much accelerated after 1900, when Mendel‚Äôs law was rediscovered by de Veries, Correns, and von Tschermak-Seysenegg. Morgan demonstrated phenomena of sex linkage in Drosphila in 1910. Subsequently, the idea of gene mapping was first proposed by a 19-year-old college student working in Linkage Mapping of QTLs involves using linkage behaviour between QTL or major genes with the markers of interest.  Linkage mapping  Based on Morgan's observation that the recombination fraction between two loci increases with the distance between them, Alfred Sturtevant neglected his homework one evening and constructed the first genetic map covering six loci in Drosophila (Sturtevant, 1913). The statistical foundations of gene mapping were subsequently laid by Haldane, Hogben, Fisher, Penrose, Smith, and Morton (Morton, 1955). Genetic dissection of simple Mendalian and Mendalian-like traits has been greatly enhanced by numerous pioneering contribution of Newton E. Morton over the decades. The same methods are widely used today for investigating and sometime determining genetic basic of complex traits. The lod score method (Morton, 1955), which constitutes the basis of most of linkage studies, has been recognized as pivotal contribution. Unfortunately, linkage analysis in humans, animals and plants languished for more than a half century after Sturtevant's discovery because of the lack of genetic markers and of adequate computing power. By the early 1970s, computing resources were sufficiently widely distributed to stimulate algorithmic breakthroughs in likelihood evaluation on human pedigree data (Elston and Stewart, 1971; Lange and Elston, 1975; Ott, 1976; Cannings et al., 1978). Armed with Ott's computer program LIPED, geneticists were well poised to embark on human linkage studies. Initially the mapping work was limited to some of morphological markers and the speed was quite low. Mapping efforts are speeded by development of DNA markers that provided virtually unlimited supply of genetic markers ‚Äì an idea first conceived by Botstein and colleagues for yeast crosses (Petes and Botstein, 1977) and subsequently for human families (Botstein et al., 1980). The idea of using markers to map in such families is to trace inheritance of existing human pedigrees as if one had set up crosses in the laboratory. After a decade of first discovery of molecular markers, the very first genome map in plants was reported in maize and tomato (Helentjaris et al., 1986) using RFLP marker in a F2 population. The familial linkage methods were very popular for qualitatively inherited molecular markers and traits of interest in humans, animals and plants. Later on the focus was turned to more complex traits ‚Äì quantitatively inherited traits with high environmental influence. Such complex traits are affected by both environment and genes. Study designs for mapping: Experimental Population vs Natural Population Natural populations include collection of individuals from a natural habitat connected with or without having pedigree. Pedigree data, if available are unmanipulated i.e. not crossed in experimenter‚Äôs interest. Pedigree can not be manipulated in human and some of animals and leaves no options of using natural populations including families whatever available in nature (for review: mapping in natural populations by Slate, 2005). QTL analysis in such population is challenging because the number of alleles segregating at the QTL is unknown, the marker phases may be unknown or only partially known, the marker and QTL allele frequencies must be estimated from the data, inbreeding loops may exist in the pedigree, and markers may be noninformative or ungenotyped. Although it is possible to simplify the analysis of complex pedigree data by fragmenting the pedigree into smaller component families, methods that fully account for complex relationships between individuals are expected to provide greater power to detect QTL (Almasy and Blangero 1998). General natural pedigree are analyzed using a mixed effects model in which components of variance (e.g. additive genetic variance, maternal effects, environmental variance) can be estimated from a pedigreed population of individuals of any structure (Slate, 2005. Variance components are usually estimated by restricted maximum-likelihood (REML). Natural population can be further classified into mapping populations consisting of related individuals (family pedigrees) or unrelated populations. Experimental crosses The traditional experimental crosses are based on single experimental cross, such as the backcross, F2 or full-sib family, initiated with two different lines. The principle behind genetic mapping that uses an experimental cross is the occurrence of recombination events between genetic loci (measured by the recombination fraction) when gametes are formed and transmitted from parents to offspring. By estimating the recombination fraction between markers and QTLs, the genomic location of the QTL of traits can be determined. QTL mapping in such experimental crosses in fixed effects modeling. Linkage vs Association Linkage and association analysis are primary tool for gene discovery, localization and functional analysis. While conceptual underpinning of these approaches have been long known, advances in recent decades in molecular genetics, development in efficient algorithms, and computing power have enabled the large scale application of these methods. While linkage studies seek to identify loci that cosegregate with the trait within families, association studies seek to identify particular variants that are associated with the phenotype at the population level. These are complementary methods that, together, provide means to probe the genome and describe etiology of complex human traits. In linkage studies, we seek to identify the loci that cosegregate with a specific genomic region, tagged by polymorphic markers, within families. In contrast, in association studies, we seek a correlation between a specific genetic variation and trait variation in sample of individuals, implicating a causal role of the variant. Linkage tests are powerful and specific for gene discovery, the localization of locus can be achieved only to a certain level of precision ‚Äì on order of megabases ‚Äì that potentially represents a region that potentially include hundreds of genes.

It is the third remake of the original 1947 film. Like the original, this film was produced by 20th Century Fox. Additionally, the New York City-based Macy's department store allowed their name to be used in this film, unlike later versions. Plot When an old man (Sebastian Cabot) spies the department store Santa Claus getting drunk before taking part in the Macy's Thanksgiving parade, he immediately locates and complains to Karen Walker (Jane Alexander), the parade director. She promptly fires her Santa Claus and the old man, who turns out to be named Kris Kringle, volunteers to take his place for the sake of the children. Kris does so well during the parade that he is immediately hired to be the store's main Santa for the holiday period. At the same time, Karen's daughter, Susan (Suzanne Davidson), an intelligent but cynical six-year-old, meets her new neighbor, Bill Schafner (David Hartman), a lawyer, and decides to try and hook him up with her mother. Kris, out of goodwill and to the horror of Mr. Schillhammer (Jim Backus), begins to send customers of Macy's to other stores if they can't find what they're looking for. In spite of Schillhammer's initial fear, the public embraces his actions as a goodwill marketing campaign and sales skyrocket, leading the profit obsessed Mr. Macy (David Doyle) to pursue the campaign in earnest. However, Karen and Shellhammer learn that Kris believes himself to actually be Santa Claus, a fact they frantically try to hide from their boss. The store's psychiatrist, Dr. Sawyer, (Roddy McDowall) initially takes Kris on as a fascinating case study, but Kris' belief that it is Sawyer who has the problem leads to him becoming an enemy instead. Kris finds a kindred spirit in the janitor, Alfred (Barry Greenburg), who gets joy out of dressing as Santa at the local YMCA every year. He also learns that Susan has been raised not to believe in Santa Claus or possess an imagination, two things he intends to correct. Susan herself is further convinced of his authenticity because he possesses a real beard and in particular when he speaks Spanish to a young girl who doesn't speak English. Through their friendship with Kris, who becomes Bill's roommate, Bill becomes closer to Karen, who is overworked and looking for companionship, and Susan begins to learn the value of imagination. She eventually asks Kris to get her a new house for Christmas to prove that he's Santa Claus, and later for help in ensuring Bill becomes her new father. Kris eventually passes the word on to Bill, who arranges for a real estate contract for Karen for a similar house and insists she buy the house for Susan's sake. Sawyer's anger with Kris leads him to antagonize him and Alfred to the point that Kris throws a pie in his face during an encounter in the lunchroom. Reluctantly, Karen agrees to allow Sawyer to evaluate him again. After Kris helps Alfred with his yearly Santa Claus routine, Dr. Sawyer confronts him and lies to Kris and tells him that Karen believes him to be a menace. In light of this, Kris deliberately fails every one of his tests at Bellevue, leading to the hospital to recommend his commitment. Kris reveals to Bill that he intends for Bill to get him off, making Bill realize that Kris wants the confrontation for the sake of proving to the world that he is the one and only Santa Claus. An angered Bill agrees, and a commitment hearing begins in which Judge Henry Harper (Tom Bosley) and D.A. Thomas Mara (James Gregory) reluctantly move forward with the case despite the terrible press it's giving their political ambitions. During the course of the hearing, Mr. Macy is placed on the stand and upon contemplating the terrible press and lost sales if he declared his own Santa a fraud, he declares he believes in Kris and fires Sawyer before he leaves the courtroom. Similarly, Harper and Mara are eventually pressed to declare that Santa Claus is real when Bill points out the terrible press, but the D.A. demands that Bill prove Kris is the one and only Santa Claus. Bill and Karen are about to give up on the case as hopeless when Susan gives Bill a letter to pass on to Kris, and Bill realizes that hundreds of children write to him every year. He quickly manipulates the court to recognize the authority of the Postal Service, and arranges the post office to deliver all of Santa's mail to the court. As Bill papers the court room in Kris' mail, Judge Harper dismisses the case in Kris' favor (as he quietly slips a letter of his own into the pile). At the celebration at the memorial home, Susan loses faith in Kris when she doesn't get her house. However, on the way back into New York, Bill and Karen drive her past the house she asked for, leading Susan to rush inside and find it even has the swing she asked for. As Karen and Bill discover Kris's distinct cane, they realize he made the arrangements and declare their love for each other.

Notably, the dialog in which Susan discovers his beard is real is still kept. Natalie Wood, who played Susan in the original film, was originally offered the role of Karen Walker, with the idea that her real life daughter would play Susan and Robert Wagner, her husband at the time, would play Bill Schaffer. Wood declined due to concerns over her daughter being too young to start acting. The film was very clearly shot during the summer as many outdoor shots depict lush, green trees.

There is a branch line from Bhairab Bazar to Mymensingh via Gouripur. These tracks are under the jurisdiction of Bangladesh Railway. History In response to the demand of the Assam tea planters for a railway link to Chittagong port, Assam Bengal Railway started construction of a railway track on the eastern side of Bengal in 1891. A track between Chittagong and Comilla was opened to traffic in 1895. The Comilla‚ÄìAkhaura‚ÄìKulaura‚ÄìBadarpur section was opened in 1896‚Äì98 and finally extended to Lumding in 1903. In an effort to link this line running on the eastern bank of the Meghna with the rail system on the western bank of the Meghna, the Tongi‚ÄìAkhaura line came up between 1910 and 1914. However, there was no bridge across the Meghna at that time. Bhairab railway bridge Meghna Railway Bridge The bridge over the Meghna River, popularly known as the Bhairab railway bridge, was opened on 6 December 1937, enabling passage between Dhaka and Chittagong. In November 2011, the Bangladesh Railway signed an agreement with two Indian private companies for the feasibility study, detail design and preparation of tender documents for the construction of the second Bhairab rail bridge across the Meghna and second rail bridge across the Titas River. The Bangladesh‚ÄìUK Friendship Bridge, completed in 2002, carries the Dhaka-Sylhet Highway across the Meghna between Bhairab Bazar and Ashuganj. Developments Bangladesh Railway signed a deal with a Chinese firm in July 2011 for doubling the single-line Tongi‚ÄìBhairab Bazar track. It has been completed by Jan. 2016. Doubling of the Akhaura‚ÄìLaksam section was initiated in 2007. Bhairab Bazar‚ÄìKishoreganj‚ÄìGouripur‚ÄìMymensingh line While the Narayanganj‚ÄìBahadurabad Ghat Line runs along the southern bank of the old channel of the Brahmaputra River, the Bhairab Bazar‚ÄìKishoreganj‚ÄìGouripur‚ÄìMymensingh line covers the northern bank of the river. The Mymensingh‚ÄìBhairab Bazar Railway Company constructed this line between 1912 and 1918. It was acquired by the government in 1948‚Äì49 and the Assam Bengal Railway Company was in charge of the management of the line. There are two lines branching out of this line ‚Äì a short Shyamganj-Jaria Janjail Line and a long Gouripur-Netrokona-Mohanganj Line.

Chen was born in Singapore in 1919, his alma mater were Tao Nan Primary School and The Chinese High School. Chen's first exposure to the dramatic arts was watching a play titled The Military Hospital by the Singapore Amateur Drama Society. The 18-year-old was deeply moved by the drama performance, and soon joined the Society. He had also worked in the comics and wood carving industries from 1937 until he joined World Bookshop in the 1950s. After his retirement in 1980, he joined the People's Association as an instructor for drama groups. Chen's theatrical training was accumulated from years of experience. Writing short stories and essays under different pseudonyms, he also wrote scripts for local radio stations and Rediffusion. In addition, he participated actively in directing and writing for the theatres. From its inception in 1955, Chen was the resident playwright for the Singapore Arts Theatre and directed 162 dramas from 1954 to 1991.

Piotr Choynowski. Internetowa encyklopedia PWN, 2011. Choynowski studied chemistry originally, in Warsaw and in Lw√≥w (now Lviv), then from 1908, history and philosophy in Zurich and at the Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w. In 1914 during World War I he joined the Polish Legions (Legiony Polskie) to fight for Poland's independence, but his poor health forced him to quit. Since 1916 Choynowski lived in Warsaw. He became the editor-in-chief of Tygodnik Ilustrowany with which he worked until 1930. From 1933 he served as member of the Academy (Polska Akademia Literatury). Choynowski was an accomplished novelist writing in the realist style based on authenticism and truthfulness of observation. In his prose, he focused on the life of Polish upper classes, inspired by writings of Henryk Sienkiewicz. One of his most notable novels, devoted to Warsaw in the year 1920, was Dom w ≈õr√≥dmie≈õciu (A House Downtown, 1924).Jean Albert B√©d√©, William Benbow Edgerton, Columbia dictionary of modern European literature.

It is an especially common problem in the United States with providers who are out of network, and therefore not subject to the rates or terms of providers who are in-network. Balance billing has a variable prevalence by market and specialty. Advocates of balance billing argue that it increases the incomes of high- quality healthcare providers, and serves as a measure of their dissatisfaction with insurance company fees. Critics say that balance billing lets providers raise charges through stealth rather than transparent pricing, creates unnecessary administrative costs and patient confusion, and allows providers to simply pass along costs to patients, rather than helping them to secure good value. It is thought to erode political consensus in favor of a one-tier system of healthcare, and to inhibit some people from getting the care they need, by making that care more expensive. Canada Throughout the 1970s in Canada, the country saw an increase in balance billing, which in Canada is normally called extra-billing. It was not permitted in Quebec or British Columbia, but had been encouraged in Ontario and Alberta, and tolerated in other provinces. The federal government estimated that by 1983, extra-billing across Canada totaled $100 million. The government believed that extra-billing was enabling the creation of a two-tiered Canadian healthcare system, in which people who couldn't afford extra charges would receive lesser care. In 1984, the government passed the Canada Health Act promising universal and comprehensive health coverage for all Canadians, which contained provisions to discourage user fees and extra-billing by imposing financial penalties on and reducing transfer payments to, provinces that permitted them. Today, five provinces prohibit all extra-billing, while Alberta, British Columbia, and Newfoundland allow it in a small number of circumstances, and Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick do not restrict it at all.  United States  Health insurance in the United States is typically provided by a managed care plan with a preferred or exclusive \\"network\\" of providers; balance billing does not occur with providers in-network, as the insurer negotiates an agreed rate ahead of the service. However, out-of-network medical billing has become common for privately insured patients even when they receive care in an in- network hospital, creating a substantial financial burden. Surprise balance billing is when an out-of-network provider bills an individual for services that were not covered by the insurance plan. This is often a surprise because an individual may be unaware that the services were out-of-network or did not actively choose to receive in an inpatient setting. The \\"growing risk to patients of incurring burdensome unexpected out-of-network bills\\" has received significant attention in the 21st century. Out-of-network care in the United States is very common and unavoidable in emergencies. A 2017 study published in Health Affairs concluded that in 2014, one in five inpatient emergency department causes will lead to surprise bills, and that 20% of emergency department admissions, 14% of outpatient visits to the emergency department, and 9% of elective inpatient admissions likely incurred a surprise medical bill. A 2020 Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker found that, \\"for people in large employer plans, 18% of all emergency visits and 16% of in-network hospital stays had at least one out-of-network charge associated with the care in 2017.\\" However, surprise billing also occurs in planned-care (non- emergency) settings: for example, when a patient receives care at an in- network hospital or ambulatory surgery center, only to subsequently learn that a specific provider or providers providing the treatment (such as an anesthesiologist or radiologist) does not participate in the network of the patient's health plan. In both circumstances, \\"the patient is not in a position to choose the provider or to determine that provider's insurance network status.\\" A 2019 Commonwealth Fund report identified 28 U.S. states as having least some consumer protections relating to balance billing.\\" This was an increase from 2017-2018, when a total of 25 states had at least some protections against surprise billing. Of the states with consumer protections relating to balance billing, only 9 states have comprehensive protections at the end of 2018. That number rose to 13 states in 2019. Researchers consider a state to offer \\"comprehensive protections\\" against surprise bill if the state's law limits a consumer's \\"financial exposure to normal in-network cost sharing\\"; bars providers from balance billing; applies to both emergency department and non-emergency care in an in-network hospital; applies to both HMO and PPO enrollees; and creates a method for resolving payment disputes between providers and insurers (either through a specific payment standard or a dispute resolution process). The states with a comprehensive approach are California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, and New York, as well as Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. A 2020 study found that reforms introduced by New York in 2014 successfully reduced out-of-network billing for emergency care by 88%. Similarly, after Texas enacted an anti-surprise billing law, the Texas Department of Insurance reported receiving up to 95% fewer surprise billing complaints.Ashley Lopez, Far Fewer Texans Have Reported Surprise Medical Bills Since New Law Went Into Effect, KUT (July 29, 2020).Jaie Avila, State says complaints down 95 percent due to new surprise medical bill law, WOAI-TV (July 28, 2020). In states with a law preventing or restricting surprise billing, commercially insured consumers who receive a surprise bill \\"may be able to obtain assistance from their state Department of Insurance, though state law protections may not cover all surprise billing situations, and may not cover people with insurance through their job.\\" Consumers who live in states that lack surprise billing protections sometimes negotiate with health care providers to write off a portion of the surprise bill, or for a repayment plan, and sometimes argue to their health insurer for the insurance company to pay a larger proportion of the bill. The 2019 Commonwealth Fund report found that federal action was needed to comprehensively protect consumers from balancing billing, given that (1) only federal law can comprehensively address patients from one state being treated by providers from another state and (2) federal law currents blocks states from enacting protections against surprise billing from air ambulance services. Congress gave the issue serious attention in 2018-2019 with both the House and Senate passing substantive bills out of committee in the summer of 2019. An American College of Emergency Physicians policy statement on balance billing noted that the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act of 1986 requires patients presenting at an emergency department for be treated regardless of insurance coverage or ability to pay as a safety net, and argues that: France In France, physicians who want to charge more than the government-negotiated set fees are considered to be in a separate \\"payment sector,\\" which essentially means they are treated as self-employed. They can charge higher fees, and receive reduced benefits. In 1987, about 27% of French physicians chose to balance the bill. The percentage is higher for specialists rather than generalists, and for doctors in urban rather than rural areas. Germany Balance billing is prohibited in Germany. Fee schedules are negotiated between sickness funds and physicians, and physicians are not permitted to charge more than the set amount. Japan Balance billing is prohibited in Japan, and extra fees are only allowed in a small number of circumstances, such as having a hospital bed with extra amenities. Taiwan Balance billing is prohibited in Taiwan, and extra fees have only been allowed recently, and in rare defined circumstances. Today, patients in Taiwan are allowed to choose more expensive versions of some devices such as stents, implants or prosthetics, and to pay the difference in cost themselves.

The corps core objectives includes research and development, tests, and management of the military communications and information systems support for the command and control of the combined arms forces. Initially part of Indian Army Corps of Signals which was established by Royal Engineers in 1911, its members and officers closely allied itself with Royal Corps of Signals, actively participated shoulder-to-shoulder in World War II, at a time when Germany invaded Great Britain. It came to existence on 14 August 1947, when Indian Army Corps of Signals was divided into two parts by the British Government, with one part remaining in India while other units formed what is now known as Corps of Signals in Pakistan. It was the brain-child of British Army's intelligence officer Major-General R. Cawthome who also founded and established the premier ISI in 1948. The Corps was supplemented with Royal Corps of Signals officers to assist into building the Corps to working strength. As soon as the Pakistan Army's signal officer were trained, the officer quickly replaced the British signal officers and closely allied the Corps with U.S. Army Signal Corps where the U.S. Signal Corps further provided advanced military training to the Corps of Signals. Major. General. Obedur Rehman was the first SO-in-C of the Corps of Signals. On March 23, 1956, the Corps was re-designed as Corps of Signals, and more objectives were made responsible to Corps. In 1948, the Corps established the Military College of Signals to train the personnel and officers for the Corps. A major re- organization were carried out when Corps officers also helped established the Joint Signal Intelligence (JSI) and the Corps nomenclature was also changed. The regiments and squadrons became as battalions and companies. In 1962, the unit was sent to Iran to help built the Iranian Army's own Signal corps, and as for its war capabilities, the Corps took participation in 1947 war, 1965 war, 1971 war, 1999 war, with India. The Corps was also involved with Afghanistan war, Bosnian war, and the Bangladesh war, making the Corps as Pakistan Army's principle combatant arm. As for its capabilities in science and technology, the Corps worked closely with Defence Science and Technology Organization (DESTO) to develop command and control software, and is notable for its participation for developing the communication system for Badr-II satellite.

He died of wounds received in active service in France in World War I. Family The son of Robert Grainger Parker and Eva Parker, he was born in Elsternwick, Victoria on 26 September 1892. He attended Essendon State School. He married Jessie Parker (she remarried after the war and became Mrs. Cumming). At the time of his enlistment, he gave his occupation as warehouseman. Footballer During the latter part of the 1911 season, the St. Kilda Football Club and its off-field operations, and its on-field performances were very seriously affected by a players' strike due to protracted disputes with the committee relating to its (mis-)management of club affairs. Due to the sudden decisions of various played not to play in a particular match, the club used a total of 62 players that season, the most ever used in a single season by a VFL club. This indicates that, given Parker only played towards the end of the season (rounds 9. 13, and 14), he may not have been selected at all if all of the regular players were available. When measured on his enlistment in the army in 1915, he was 5 ft 9in tall, and weighed 13 stone. Recruited from the Essendon District Football League, aged 18, Parker played his first senior VFL match for St Kilda, against Collingwood, at Victoria Park on 17 June 1911. He played his second, against Fitzroy, at the Junction Oval, on 15 July 1911. He played the last of his three VFL senior matches against Melbourne on 22 July, at the Junction Oval. The St Kilda team were so late taking the field that some thought they were not going to play at all. Apart from Wels Eicke, the St Kilda team were hopeless. Heckled, booed, and taunted by the crowd after the match as he was leaving the ground, the St Kilda captain of the day, Harry Lever, had to be restrained from climbing the fence and dealing with the barrackers. Parker's hopes for a fourth match were no doubt dashed by his elementary error of mistaking the behind posts for the goal posts: Oarsman He was a well known oarsman, and was a member of the Civil Service Rowing Club.Argus Obituary. Soldier Prior to his enlistment on 11 October 1915, Parker had 3¬Ω years experience in the Citizen's Military Force. Parker was promoted to Second Lieutenant on 21 Feb 1916. Death He was badly wounded in action with the 37th Infantry Battalion of the 3rd Division of the AIF, during a trench raid in France on the night of 29 January 1917, when he was struck in the groin by German machine gun fire. He was lying in a shell hole, and was too badly wounded to be carried back to the Australian lines. The entire stretcher party that had gone to retrieve him were shot down before they could reach the shell-hole; and, by the time a patrolling party could reach the site, Parker was no longer there. He was taken prisoner by the Germans, and was admitted to the Bavarian Field Hospital, Lambersart, Lille, France. He died of his wounds in the German hospital the next day. Remembered Buried at the Rue-Petillon Military Cemetery, Fleurbaix, France, Parker is commemorated in a two-panel memorial window installed at St. Johns Uniting Church, at the corner of Mount Alexander Road and Buckley Street, Essendon (\\"In Loving Memory of Lieut Harold Carlyle Parker, 27th Battln, Died of wounds within the German Lines at Armentieres, 30th Jany 1917, aged 25 years.

Sequestration is rare, and becoming less common, due to the expense and concerns about the impact on jury members. In most trials that last more than a single day, jurors are instead sent home for the night with instructions to isolate themselves from inappropriate influence until they return and the trial resumes. Sequestration is most commonly used in high-profile trials in which media coverage and public conversations about the case may be so ubiquitous that it is difficult for jurors to avoid. A judge also may order that a jury be sequestered to prevent others from tampering with them through undue persuasion, threats, or bribes. The trials of O.J.

On January 6, 2011, Alexander also declared his candidacy for the presidential nomination of the California-based Peace and Freedom Party.U.S. Election 2012: Stewart Alexander to Seek PFP, SPUSA and Green Party Presidential Nominations Banderasnews.com, January 6, 2011 He received the presidential nomination from the Socialist Party USA on October 15, 2011 at the Party's national convention in Los Angeles, California. In August, Alexander sought the nomination of the Peace and Freedom Party, a ballot qualified socialist party in California. Alexander/Mendoza lost the nomination to a ticket of comedian Roseanne Barr and anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan. Shortly thereafter, Alexander resigned from the Steering Committee of the Peace and Freedom Party, citing a lack of support for socialist candidates by the PFP. Political Positions During his political campaign, Alexander's positions challenged the establishment, thinking of the mainstream political parties and pundits in the mainstream media. This included calling the Affordable Care Act a \\"corporate giveaway\\" that he called the \\"corporate restructuring of the healthcare system in America\\" for the benefit of private healthcare companies, supporting private Chelsea Manning saying that \\"whistleblowers should be protected not prosecuted,\\" criticizing the impeachment of Paraguay's president (calling it a coup), that President Barack Obama represents the one percent not the 99 percent and that Bush-era policies of a surveillance state and permanent war have expanded under Obama's watch.http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2012/06/29/18716571.phphttp://www.stewartalexanderforpresident2012.org/pr/pr012312.pdfhttp://www.stewartalexanderforpresident2012.org/pr/pr110311.pdfhttp://socialistwebzine.blogspot.com/2012/01/socialist- response-to-state-of- union.htmlhttp://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2012/06/27/18716441.php Alexander has additionally demanded term limits for those in the Supreme Court and called for Justice Clarence Thomas to be impeached for not noting that he received $700,000 dollars on a government disclosure form and for attending \\"secret meetings with conservative business leaders at an event sponsored and hosted by the Koch brothers\\" before the Citizens United vs. FEC decision.http://rochester.indymedia.org/node/6204 However, Alexander also took a jab at other third parties as well, like the Illinois Green Party noting that \\"the big surprise of this election season is that another Third Party, the Illinois Green Party, not the Democrats and Republicans are the ones resorting to dirty tricks...Rob Sherman the Chair of the Cook County Green Party...filed the challenge to get us thrown off the ballot...the innocent victim in all of this is Jill Stein...However, blocking the Socialist Party and other parties in Illinois will be a black eye for her campaign. Green Party claims to support open electoral laws will be permanently suspect unless Sherman removes his challenge.\\"http://socialistwebzine.blogspot.com/2012/07/greens-challenge- third-parties-fight.html There were a number of interviews and stories about the presidential campaign. The first instance was an interview with the blog called The Modern Left.http://www.themodernleft.com/2012/01/interview-with- socialist-party-usa-2012.html Some excerpts from the interview are as follows: :‚Ä≥In a nutshell, what is your platform? :The Stewart Alexander Presidential Campaign is committed to socialism, democracy, ecology, feminism and racial equality. My :platform is committed to the transformation of capitalism through the creation of a democratic socialist society. To create a :better future for working people, my platform will offer a guide that will establish a new social and economic order in which :democracy will allow the 99% to shape our own future ‚Äì in our neighborhoods, in our local government, and, perhaps most :importantly, in our economy... :Why Socialism? Can you explain for those who aren't familiar with the platform you are running on? :Capitalism has never worked for the majority of people in society. Capitalism is a system that has continuously exploited :working people in order to increase the profits of a few multi-national corporations and the world's super rich. Socialists :believe the economic model for the nation must change from capitalism to a democratic socialist economy... :What specifically makes your campaign unique? :The Stewart Alexander 2012 Presidential Campaign will offer a full democratic socialist alternative to voters. We will be a :left- wing option to the parties of the 1% - the Democrats and Republicans... :What drew you to the Socialist Party? :...In 2007, my political interests were more on a national level and the PFP was a California-based political party. I :decided to attend the national convention for the Socialist Party in St. Louis as a presidential candidate...Both the :Socialist Party and the PFP are founded on the principle of protecting the interests of working people. This idea really :attracted me to them. :Why should people vote for you instead of President Barack Obama or whomever wins the GOP nomination? :Working people should vote for me as president because I represent the people. I hope that when they read my program, or hear :me speak, or watch me on TV they will encounter ideas that connect with their everyday lives...They will also find that :President Obama represents Wall Street and the GOP candidates represent Wall Street. I come from the 99%, I live with the 99% :and I will represent political positions that will better the lives of the 99%... :Your Wikipedia bio states that you were in the Air Force Reserve. Has having a military background influenced your politics? :Near the end of my military service, I was able to look back on that experience, and I realized that war is not about :protecting our freedoms; war is big business with a high cost of human life and suffering... :As the Vice Presidential candidate on the 2008 Socialist Party ticket, do you feel that campaign made any mistakes and how :will your campaign differ this time? :My approach in 2012 has been to get my vice presidential running mate involved in the campaign from day one... :What do you think are the three most important problems facing American's today? :Jobs...Reclaiming our constitutional rights...U.S. military aggression and the costs of war :What do you plan to do to fix those issues? :...We will create jobs directly and immediately by creating an emergency national employment program :and by providing public :funding for an independent worker-owned and worker-managed cooperative sector...I will...Repeal the U.S.A. Patriot Act, and :the National Defense Authorization Act. I call for the abolition of the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security :Agency, and all other institutions of covert warfare...I will call for an immediate 50 percent cut in the military budget, :followed by additional cuts, with the aim of rapidly reducing the military budget to less than 10 percent of its current :level... :What would you most like potential voters to know about you? :Know that I am a working person and I am just like the majority of Americans...Capitalism has failed working people; a :democratic socialist society is the new direction we need as a nation to move toward a better future. Other places on the internet also wrote about the campaign, including an article in The Root.http://www.theroot.com/views/stewart-alexander-wants- your-vote This article quoted Alexander at numerous times, where he notes despite the lack of coverage in the corporate media people are coming around to the idea of socialism and the article concludes with him offering the Socialist Party USA as an alternative. Another article written by Scott Tucker for Truthdig also has a favorable view.http://www.truthdig.com/report/print/make_your_vote_count_for_socialism_20120228/ Tucker writes that \\"Stewart Alexander believes fair elections are worth a fair fight and he's asking for your vote...He is a democratic socialist, an African-American community activist and the presidential candidate of the Socialist Party in 2012...Alexander is not simply a \\"left-wing Keynesian\\" reformer ... Alexander has also been a strong critic of Obama's \\"continuation of the Bush era security state policies.\\" He has the same moral fire and political clarity as Eugene Debs ... Alexander began looking and thinking beyond an electoral system dominated by two big corporate parties. He was briefly inspired by the campaign of Ross Perot ... The program of the Socialist Party of the United States is both class conscious and civil libertarian, and Alexander will give American voters a chance to truly make our votes count for democracy and socialism.\\" He then proceeded in asking five questions of Alexander: :QUESTION: What are your views about rebuilding a base of manufacturing jobs in this country, beyond the sector of military :industries? :RESPONSE BY ALEXANDER:...I believe that we can rebuild the manufacturing sector in the United States...in a democratic way :that allows us to build a society based on solidarity and justice...We believe in the creation of an independent worker owned :and operated cooperative sector that can be used to rebuild the manufacturing capacity of the United States... :QUESTION: How do we make our votes count at the state and federal levels especially? What reforms are necessary to :challenge corporate politics and make electoral politics more democratic? :RESPONSE BY ALEXANDER:...Consider Citizens United a kind of high point of neoliberalism...the best way to think about :overturning such undemocratic decisions‚Äînot primarily through a legal strategy, but through a democratic revolution from :below...in the longer term, we want to fight for electoral reforms such as public financing of elections, proportional :representation and a uniform open ballot access law. :QUESTION: Overall, there are now more people in 'correctional supervision' in America‚Äîmore than 6 million‚Äîthan were in the :Gulag Archipelago under Stalin at its height. That city of the confined and the controlled, Lockuptown, is now the second :largest in the United States...What are your thoughts and practical proposals? :RESPONSE BY ALEXANDER:The prison-industrial complex is then used to warehouse and discipline those who have been left behind :by an economic system that only considers the needs and interests of the 1 percent...I believe that we need to enact policies :emphasizing decriminalization while also creating spaces for the self-empowerment of poor and working class people. We must :immediately end the destructive drug war by creating a legal justice system based on prevention, mediation, restitution and :rehabilitation. :QUESTION: What are your immediate demands to prevent war? What are your long-range proposals for transforming the war :economy into a commonwealth dedicated to peace? :RESPONSE BY ALEXANDER: I'll start by saying that it is very easy to hold an anti-war position...we are not only anti-war but :we are also anti-militarist...We seek to put a permanent end to the role of the U.S. military‚Äìindustrial complex in our :country and in our world...Military spending is a monumental waste of resources...the death and destruction that the U.S. :military has caused throughout the world...We want to repair these bonds with socialist values of solidarity, compassion and :justice. :QUESTION: How did you find your way into the socialist movement? :RESPONSE BY ALEXANDER: There really is no one single way to get involved in radical politics. For every active socialist I :meet while campaigning, I hear a different story...As I grew older, I realized that there was political strength in numbers :and I got involved first with the Peace and Freedom Party and later the Socialist Party USA. I liked the fact that both :organizations place the interests of poor and working class people at the center of their political projects. Beyond this, there wasn't many other sympathetic articles or such other than an article in Irregular Times which noted about Alexander: \\"Right wingers, this is what genuine Socialists, Marxists, Communists look like,\\" another on the Dissenting Democrat blog which noted the campaign called for \\"radical democratization\\" of society, one on Uncovered Politics where the writer covers the campaign itself and another on examiner.comhttp://irregulartimes.com/index.php/archives/2011/04/06/the-real- socialist-candidate-for- president/http://dissentingdemocrat.wordpress.com/2012/08/01/stewart- alexander-alex-mendoza-the-real-socialist- candidates/http://www.uncoveredpolitics.com/2011/10/16/socialist-party-taps- stewart-alexander-for-president/ There were some videos on YouTube as well including a clip from the Stossel Show about if America could accept a socialist president, another interview with jeff4justice and numerous other video clips.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuDY77wH0KUhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EwqaJkGOqQhttps://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22Stewart+Alexander%22&oq;=%22Stewart+Alexander%22&gs;_l=youtube.3..0l2.125734.127662.0.128049.2.2.0.0.0.0.82.138.2.2.0...0.0...1ac.1.QlM5KXy8854 Since there weren't many other stories about the campaign, the Presidential questionnaire put out by the Socialist Party USA gives some idea of his other positions as does the issues page on his website.http://stewartalexanderforpresident2012.org/issues/ In a pre-election message, Stewart Alexander wrote that their campaign \\"sought to unveil the lies of the capitalists that has given working people a false sense of hope and security that has only enslaved the minds of working people...The Alexander/Mendoza campaign believe that this campaign is marking a new beginning and is changing the conscience of the nation that capitalism will never work for working people because it is built on greed and competition; to the contrary, the Alexander/Mendoza campaign has shared the message of socialism to fosters the concept of a society that is based on compassion, empathy, respect, cooperation and the development of new social structures.\\"http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2012/09/29/18722632.php Campaign and Aftermath A number of differing people endorsed Stewart Alexander.http://stewartalexanderforpresident2012.org/campaign/endorsements/ These included David McReynolds, who was the first homosexual candidate for president, the National Secretary of the Socialist Party USA Greg Pason, a teacher named Steve Soltysik, Maggie Phair of the Maggie Phair Institute, the County Chairperson of Kern County's Peace and Freedom Party named Mohammad Arif, a U.S. Senate candidate for 2012 named Kabiruddin Karim Ali and the New Progressive Alliance which stands for peace, full employment at a Living Wage, environmental sustainability, Medicare for All, Fair Trade, human rights, civil liberties, reforming elections, holding corporations accountable, and the creation of a public infrastructure bank.http://newprogs.org/unified- progressive-platform- ratifiedhttp://newprogs.org/blog/2012/07/03/29-candidates-17-states-and- counting In the 2012 election, Stewart Alexander garnered 4,430 votes.http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/ Instead of conceding to the newly elected President Barack Obama, Alexander wrote a \\"concession\\" letter in which he did not wish Obama success in his future endeavors but hoped that he could \\"forgive my inability to do so.\\" As a result, Alexander criticized the President for continuing George W. Bush's policies, helping coordinate the crackdown on the Occupy Movement, possible future intimidation of \\"various leftist groups,\\" the continuation of drone attacks which have caused numerous innocents to be killed, including an American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki,\\" the continuation of assaults and indefinite detentions of activists, more wars that are \\"fossil fuels,\\" pushing the scaling back of \\"our meager social safety...leaving those most in need with even less.\\" In the end of the letter, he offers an alternative saying he will be \\"hoping for success for the people of the United States and for working people across the world rather than financial success of Wall Street...I will be continuing the fight to awaken the minds of the American people to the truth and striving for non-violent, democratic revolution.\\"http://stewartalexanderforpresident2012.org/campaign/concession- letter/ More than a month later, the Socialist Party USA website interviewed Alexander in a post-election interview. In the interview they asked him twelve questions covering every aspect of his campaign. Here are some excerpts from that interview:http://socialistparty- usa.org/socialist/2012/dec12/StewartAlexanderInterview.pdf *\\"I became a candidate for president of the U.S. because I believe in socialism and I have been a victim of capitalism for my entire life. What we as socialists are striving to achieve...a democratic socialist society based upon respect and goodwill toward other members within our society...My message was not about reforming capitalism, but a total transformation of society from capitalism to socialism and the development of new social structures.\\" *\\"Today, it is impossible for third party candidates and minor parties to compete with the big-money parties and in the 21st century...the bar has been raised to manage a successful presidential campaign in the U.S....at a half billion dollars to enter and $1 billion for the top two.\\" *\\"Through the Internet and Facebook, the campaign was invited to speak at high school and college campuses...[and this] helped the Alexander/Mendoza campaign to reach tens of millions of working people throughout the U.S. and internationally.\\" *\\"During these difficult times...millions of working people are now open to socialist ideas. The Alexander/Mendoza campaign was always clear....that we are committed to the transformation of capitalism through the creation of a democratic socialist society...Therefore, messages about jobs and earnings were most effective. This message reached all age groups.\\" *\\"As a presidential candidate...the challenges were few. When someone challenged me regarding homeless issues, I could respond that I was homeless in Los Angeles for months. When I was challenged regarding poverty issues, I could say that I lived in poverty as a child. When I was challenged on labor issues, I spoke to them based upon my experience as a retail clerk\\" *\\"There was little interest [in the campaign] from the corporate media until a few weeks prior to the General Election...I've always believed that you can accomplish anything with enough money, time or effort. The Alexander/Mendoza campaign effectively maximized the latter two; we collectively donated time and effort.\\" *\\"The greatest surprise during the campaign was during the state convention of the Peace and Freedom Party...The PFP delegates chose to have a comedian as their presidential nominee [Roseanne Barr]. If we wish to collectively build the socialist movement, we must choose our representatives well. We need Socialists who understand that only socialism will provide for the future needs of working people, and that the challenges of working people will not be resolved by reforms or comic relief.\\" *\\"I do not intend to run for public office in the future...It is time for me to give a little back and spend more time with the one I love.\\" *\\"I believe the U.S. political system is completely corrupt. We must continue to lead. However, it will not be in Congress or the White House...The Occupy movement is the face of a revolution that is crossing the nation. I believe we will win because capitalism is destined to fail.\\" External links * Socialist Party USA website * Personal website * Presidential campaign website References Socialist 2012 ","title":"Stewart Alexander 2012 presidential campaign"},{"id":"34143631","text":"Emmalocera transecta is a species of snout moth in the genus Emmalocera described by Alfred Jefferis Turner in 1947.

He was the first Hispanic American to serve in the Illinois General Assembly and the first and only Hispanic American to chair the Cook County Democratic Party. He was a Commissioner on the Cook County Board of Review, a property tax assessment appeal panel. He was also a commissioner on the Cook County Board of Review, a property tax assessment appeal panel. Throughout his career, Berrios combined government sector jobs, elected office, unpaid political party leadership positions, and private-sector proprietorships in lobbying, consulting and insurance sales. His political campaign strategies included ballot access challenges to potential opponents. He has been the focus of investigations into allegations of ethics violations and political corruption with respect to campaign fund-raising and nepotism. In the press and in the courts, Berrios has repeatedly defended his right as an elected official to hire relatives and to accept campaign contributions from those with business with his office. Berrios was defeated in the March 20, 2018 Democratic primary election for Cook County Assessor, conceding to Fritz Kaegi.  Early life, education, and early political career  Berrios was born on February 14, 1952, the oldest of seven children. His parents were Puerto Rican natives. When he was six, his family moved into the Cabrini-Green public housing high-rises. At age 13, Berrios got a job as a dishwasher in the Tower Club, a private restaurant on the 39th floor of the Civic Opera House, worked there for seven years, and eventually become a waiter. Berrios graduated from Lane Technical College Prep High School in Chicago, and received a bachelor's degree in accounting from the University of Illinois Chicago. Berrios' first political role was the unpaid position of a precinct captain in the 31st Ward political organization of Alderman Thomas Keane, Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley's chief ally on the Chicago City Council. Berrios first met Keane while a student at the University of Illinois Chicago, Berrios was ticketed for speeding on the Kennedy Expressway and called on his alderman and committeeman Keane. In October 1974, Keane was convicted of conspiracy and mail fraud for using his elected office to profit from illegal real estate deals. His wife, Adeline succeeded him as alderman and Edward Nedza as committeeman. In 1978 Nedza won the Illinois state Senate seat from the 5th Senate district, which encompasses the Humboldt Park neighborhood of Chicago, and much of the 31st ward. Nedza, a Polish-American, recognized the growing Puerto Rican population in his district, and groomed Hispanics within the Democratic Party. Nedza's political proteg√©s included Alderman Miguel Santiago of the 31st ward, the only Hispanic on the Chicago City Council at the time, and Berrios.  Illinois State Representative  Chicago-area Latino groups contested the legislative district map of the Illinois General Assembly in United States federal court. The panel of judges that decided the case ordered a new map that gave Hispanics a majority in two Illinois House of Representatives districts in Chicago, the 9th, which is predominantly Puerto Rican, and the 20th, which is predominantly Mexican American. In 1982, Nedza sponsored Berrios, at the time chief clerk to Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals Commissioner Harry Semrow, in the 9th district. Berrios was one of three candidates who filed nominating petitions to run in the Democratic primary, but Berrios ran unopposed when the petitions of the other two candidates were successfully challenged. Republicans fielded no candidate in their primary, so Berrios ran unopposed in the general election, and at the age of 30 became the first Hispanic American to serve in the Illinois General Assembly. Berrios ran for re-election unopposed in the Fall 1986 general election. He won re-election twice, serving three two-year terms. Berrios maintained his job in Chicago as chief clerk of the Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals while serving part-time as a legislator in the state capital in downstate Springfield, Illinois. In December, 1985 he was one of 21 state legislators criticised for holding a second, taxpayer-salaried government job in a report issued by the Coalition for Political Honesty, founded by Board of (Tax) Appeals Commissioner Pat Quinn, later Illinois Treasurer, Lieutenant Governor and Governor.  Democratic party posts   31st ward Democratic committeeman  In March 1987 then former State Senator Edward Nedza, Berrios' mentor, was indicted in a federal investigation of bribes allegedly paid to city licensing officials. In April, 1987 Nedza resigned his position as committeeman of the 31st ward in Chicago and named Berrios as his replacement. In August, 1987, Nedza was convicted on federal charges of using his political office for illegal financial gain. Berrios allied with Alderman Edward Vrdolyak, during Chicago Mayor Harold Washington's first term, the Council Wars era. In 1987 Raymond Figueroa, with Washington's backing, defeated Berrios's candidate for alderman, Miguel Santiago, which helped close the Council Wars. A year later Figueroa defeated Berrios for committeeman. In 1991, Figueroa decided not to run for re-election as alderman, and left the committeeman's job the following year. Berrios regained the committeeman's post, a role he has held ever since.  Chairman, Cook County Democratic Party  Thomas G. Lyons, a veteran 45th Ward committeeman who had held the unpaid party position of chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party for nearly 17 years, was seriously ill and announced his retirement in January 2007, and died on January 12 at age 75. Democrats met in Chicago on February 1 to fill the vacancy and elected Berrios as their new chairman. Berrios was the first Hispanic to hold the post, which he held until April 18, 2018 following his defeat in the Democratic primary for Cook County Assessor.  Commissioner on the Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals/Cook County Board of Review  Berrios' boss at the Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals, Harry H. Semrow, died November 23, 1987 at age 72. In accordance with state law, the Chief Judge of the Cook County Circuit Court appointed a temporary replacement, attorney Thomas A. Jaconetty, 34, a deputy assessor with the Board of (Tax) Appeals since 1981. Jaconnetty was a 31st ward resident and the secretary of Berrios' 31st ward Democratic organization with whom Berrios had been a precinct captain in the 31st Ward under Alderman Keane. Berrios ran for the vacancy with the backing of the Democratic party organization. In the Democratic primary, Berrios won the nomination with a sizable margin over Jeffrey Paul Smith, an assistant corporation counsel with the City of Chicago whose candidacy was sponsored by Quinn, by then a former Commissioner. He ultimately won the special election in November. When first elected to the Board of (Tax) Appeals in 1988, Berrios was paid about $56,000 a year. In October 1990, Berrios added a part-time job as a legislative aide to a political ally, Democratic State Representative Miguel Santiago. The job paid Berrios nearly $10,000 over the next two years. Also while working at the tax appeals board, Berrios worked as a lobbyist and a consultant to the state government, sometimes in association with his longtime business partner, Sam Panayotovich. From 1988 to 1993, Panayotovich and Berrios won a $185,000 no-bid contract as the Illinois Department of Transportation's (IDOT's) liaison with lawmakers and municipal officials. On March 11, 1994 FBI agents executed a search warrant to confiscate records from the Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals as part of an ongoing investigation. Weeks later, federal agents investigating ghost payrolling subpoenaed financial records regarding several past and current employees of the Board, including Berrios and Panayotovich. The US Treasury Department investigated the IDOT contracts with Berrios and Panayotovich, and a federal grand jury subpoenaed the contracts. A federal grand jury in Chicago subpoenaed records documenting the recipients of tuition waivers to state universities request by three current and two former state legislators, including Berrios and Panayotovich. The scholarship program, begun in 1905, allowed each state legislator to waive the tuition and fees of any of the state's 12 public universities, for any two students who live within the legislator's district, without regard to academic achievement or financial need. No charges were filed against anyone in the Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals. The Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals was reconstituted and renamed the Cook County Board of Review in 1998. Berrios continued to serve until 2010. Michael Cabonargi was appointed as his successor. In a 2013 federal bribery trial of a Board of Review analyst, in secret recordings by an undercover FBI informant from 2008, the defendant named Berrios as a recipient of bribes. Berrios was not accused of any wrongdoing.  Hiring of relatives and friends  While Commissioner on the Board of Review, Berrios' sister, sister-in-law, son and daughter worked for the county at annual salaries ranging from $48,000 to $86,000. \\"Let me see, one, two, three ... yeah, four,\\" Berrios told the Associated Press. Berrios also hired, as a deputy chief commissioner, election law attorney Jaconetty, who wrote the chapter on ballot access in the courseware of the Illinois Institute for Continuing Legal Education. Berrios responded to criticisms of his hiring of relatives and friends, said, > What you're basically saying is that Joe Berrios should get out of politics. > If my brothers or whoever wants to come and work in government, they > shouldn't be allowed to work in government. If you want to pass a law that > says one individual is in government, then none of their friends or > relatives can work in government, then you should pass that law.  Political fundraising from tax appeal lawyers  Board of (Tax) Appeals Commissioner Berrios regularly accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in campaign contributions from lawyers who appealed property tax assessments before the Board. Berrios controls five personal political action committees, not including the fund for the Cook County Democratic Party, which he also controls. Berrios collected more than $3 million in political contributions between 2000 and 2010, 64 percent from property tax appeal lawyers. About one-third of Berrios' campaign contributions in that decade came from the 15 property tax appeal law firms that gained the most for their clients between 2006 and 2008, contributing almost $1 million to six political action committees controlled by Berrios and his daughter, Illinois State Representative Maria Antonia Berrios, Democrat of the 39th Illinois House district on Chicago's northwest side. Berrios started 2008 with $1.2 million in just one of his several campaign funds, much of it from attorneys who appeared before him. Several of the most successful property tax appeal law firms in Cook County have strong political connections. From 2006 to 2008, the tax appeal law firms that received the largest reductions for their clients were those of Representative Michael J. Madigan (the Illinois House Speaker, a Chicago Democrat and close ally of Berrios), Patrick J. Cullerton (the brother of Illinois State Senator John Cullerton, the president of the Illinois Senate), and Chicago Alderman Edward M. Burke. Simultaneously, Berrios worked as a registered lobbyist to Illinois state government on issues such as legalizing video poker. Berrios lobbies Madigan and Cullerton in Springfield, while the Assessor is critical to the lucrative commercial real-estate tax appeals practices of law firms, including those of Madigan and Cullerton. \\"Illinois, thy name is conflict of interest,\\" wrote Better Government Association Executive Director Andy Shaw in the Chicago Tribune in 2009. \\"Even by Illinois's loose conflict of interest standards, the obviousness of the Madigan-Berrios connection is stupefying,\\" wrote Chicago Magazine in 2013.  Cook County Assessor   Campaign and election  Cook County Assessor James Houlihan announced that he would not seek re-election in 2010. Within hours, Berrios said he planned to announce his candidacy for assessor. On February 2, 2010 Berrios won the three-way Democratic primary with 39% of the vote, in a primary with the lowest turn-out since 1958. Berrios' candidacy was denounced by local editorial boards. The Chicago Tribune editorial board described Berrios as \\"a terrible candidate for the powerful office of assessor\\" and called the Democratic Party of Cook County's slating of Berrios for Assessor a \\"miserable mistake,\\" citing \\"his disregard for basic ethical principles\\" and \\"patent conflicts of interest.\\" The Chicago Sun-Times editorial board called the slating a \\"tragedy,\\" describing Berrios as \\"a fine example, in fact, of why Illinois needs serious campaign finance reform with teeth in it,\\" and citing Berrios' lack of transparency on the Board of Review, his record of hiring family and friends, and his \\"cozy\\" relationship with Madigan. The Daily Herald editorial board called Berrios \\"the very antithesis of what the office needs.\\" A profile in Chicago Magazine described him as \\"a consummate insider in Illinois politics\\" and \\"a vivid example of the clout- infested politics for which Illinois is famous.\\" On Monday morning, September 13, 2010, while candidate Berrios was at a campaign fund-raising breakfast, the Finance Committee of the Cook County Board met and approved a package of ethics reforms in response to Berrios, including a measure that required candidates for Assessor or the Board of Review to return contributions from property tax appeal lawyers of more than $1,500, and prohibiting public officials from conducting political activities while at work for the county or using county resources. \\"The law stinks, bottom line,\\" Berrios said. Cook County Commissioner Forrest Claypool filed nominating petitions to run as an independent candidate for assessor. Berrios dropped a challenge to Claypool's nominating petitions after Berrios' lawyers examined Claypool's 90,000 signatures, 65,000 more than required.   Berrios prevailed in the November 2010 general election with 46 percent of the vote in a field that also included Republican Sharon Strobeck-Eckersall. Claypool attributed his defeat to his failure to get enough suburban support to offset Berrios' organization in Chicago.  Campaign fundraising in excess of County limits  Assessor Berrios was investigated by the Cook County Board of Ethics for allegedly accepting excessive political contributions from attorneys who argued property-tax appeals before the Assessor and Board of Review. The Board of Ethics sent letters to 15 tax attorneys, warning that their donations to Berrios during the 2010 election cycle had exceeded the county campaign contribution limits. Berrios' attorney objected that the regulation was \\"illegal\\", and Berrios sought an advisory opinion from the Cook County State's Attorney. In February 2011, a Cook County Deputy State's Attorney wrote an advisory opinion that the County Board lacked the home rule authority to limit campaign contributions to the Assessor and that state campaign finance law prevails. The County Board's legal counsel issued an opinion that the new contribution limits were unconstitutional. Cook County commissioners scaled back the campaign finance reform law and the Cook County Board of Ethics dropped its investigation of Berrios' campaign contributions.  Hiring and promoting relatives and friends  Days after taking office, Berrios hired his son, sister and Jaconetty to work for him, bringing them over from the property tax appeals board. The family members received raises in their new positions. Berrios also brought over from the property tax appeals board veteran staff member, Felix Cardona Jr., the treasurer for Citizens for Maria A. Berrios, Berrios' daughter's campaign committee. Asked if the hirings confirmed past criticisms, Berrios said: \\"I still won the election.\\" Patrick Blanchard, the county's Inspector General, and MaryNic Foster, Executive Director of the Cook County Board of Ethics, the County's top two government watchpersons, issued a joint advisory memo to County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, all 17 Cook County commissioners, and nine other elected county officials, including Berrios, warning them that hiring relatives violated county ethics laws. The Cook County Board of Ethics initiated an investigation of Berrios. The federal-court appointed attorneys monitoring City of Chicago and Cook County compliance with the Shakman decrees, designed to prevent politics from influencing most personnel decisions, raised objections to as many as 27 hirings and firings in the first month of the Berrios administration of the Assessor's office. On January 28, 2011, to comply with County Board President Preckwinkle's request for across-the-board 16 percent budget cuts to help close an estimated $487 million budget shortfall, Berrios laid off 53 employees, of which 48 were members of unions, but Berrios' relatives remained on the payroll.  * On July 17, 2013, the Cook County Board approved $529,000 in settlements to 11 former employees of the Assessor's office that the court-appointed Shakman decree monitor had determined had been fired unlawfully by Berrios for political reasons. While the Cook County Board of Ethics consideration of Berrios' possible violations of County nepotism ordinances was pending, reports by WGN-TV, the Better Government Association, and Chicago Magazine questioned Berrios' relationship to John J. Pikarski, the Board's chairman, and also a prominent, long-time real estate zoning attorney. Pikarski's law firm had represented clients before the County Board of Review on which Berrios served, and had donated thousands of dollars to Berrios' political campaigns. One day after the release of the joint investigations, Pikarski resigned. In its final determination dated June 20, 2012 the Cook County Board of Ethics recommended that Berrios remove his son and sister from the County payroll and fined Berrios $10,000 total ($5,000 for each of two relatives he hired). \\"To me it's not big deal, because I've been told by the state's attorney they have no power over us,\\" Berrios said. A Chicago Tribune editorial called Berrios' hiring of his relatives \\"a flagrant violation of the county's ethics rules.\\" County Board President Preckwinkle said, > I've always said throughout my political career that if you're in public > office, you should not hire your relatives. This is not appropriate. And it > leads to the perception that government is only for friends and family. And > that's neither good nor right. Preckwinkle fired Foster in May, 2013. \\"Joe is a political ally,\\" Preckwinkle said. Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez declined to represent Berrios or the Board of Ethics in the nepotism issue, citing conflict of interest. A Cook County Circuit Court judge appointed an outside lawyer to represent Berrios before the Board of Ethics beginning in April 2011, and the firm billed the county $4,773 for its work as of September, 2012. The Board of Ethics rejected Berrios' appeal of the final determination. By November, 2012, 15 members of Berrios' family were on state or county payrolls or receiving state or county pensions. Berrios topped the \\"Hall of Shame\\" category in \\"Chicago's Best and Worst Politicians of 2012\\" in Chicago Magazine's December, 2012 issue. The Board of Ethics petitioned the courts for a special prosecutor, and a judge appointed attorney and former Chicago Inspector General David H. Hoffman. By March, 2013, Berrios had billed the County $24,716 for his defense against the Board of Ethics' ruling. In April, 2015 the judge ruled that the Board of Ethics had no authority to impose fines on the Assessor. As of June, 2016, twelve Berrios relatives were government employees or receiving public pensions, totalling nearly $1.1 million a year. Cook County homeowners are eligible for a property-tax break on their primary residence, but a manager in Assessor's office was granted the homeowner's exemption on two homes. In 2012 Cook County Inspector General Blanchard subpoenaed the Assessor's office seeking documents related to the exemptions. Berrios ignored the subpoena, claiming that the County Inspector General has no authority over him. Blanchard filed suit against Berrios. Berrios is represented in the suit by Cook County State's Attorney Alvarez. On January 15, 2014, a Cook County circuit court judge ruled that the County Inspector General had the authority to investigate the Assessor and all other independently elected County offices. On August 21, 2014, the judge ruled the Assessor must comply with the Inspector General's subpoena. On December 1, 2016, the Illinois Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Cook County Inspector General has the power to investigate the Cook County Assessor, affirming two lower court decisions.  Business interests and personal life  Berrios is a partner with Sam Panayotovich in, and secretary of, a lobbying firm, B-P Consulting, Inc. with offices in Springfield and downtown Chicago. Lobbying clients include the Illinois Licensed Beverage Association and the Illinois Coin Machine Operators Association, manufacturers and distributors of video poker machines. Berrios is President of an insurance agency, J B Insurance - Consulting Inc. with an office in downtown Chicago. Berrios lives in the Belmont Cragin neighborhood on Chicago's Northwest Side. He is the father of three children, including former Illinois State Representative Maria Antonia \\"Toni\\" Berrios.

Early life and education Arnold grew up in a family of four near Atlanta, Georgia, and graduated from Brookwood High School, a public school in Snellville, in 1992. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Auburn University in 1996, where he double majored in philosophy and religion. After graduating from college, Arnold went to graduate school at the Ohio State University and taught philosophy, earning an MA in philosophy in 1999. Arnold entered the Delayed Entry Program of the United States Army in 2002, and after enlisting in February 2003 he served in Baghdad, Iraq with the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division. After completing his active duty service in May, 2009, Arnold began attending Vanderbilt University Law School on the post-9/11 GI Bill and the Yellow Ribbon program. While in law school, Arnold developed a reputation as an outstanding legal debater and received numerous awards for scholastic and professional excellence, including both the Richard Nagareda Best Oralist Award and the Lightfoot Franklin & White Award for Best Oralist. Arnold was also a fellowship recipient of the Cal Turner Fellowship for Moral Leadership in the Professions. He received his law degree in May, 2012. Personal life Arnold has an identical twin brother Jarrett who teaches high school science at the Field School in Washington, D.C.; since he and his brother were born premature, they weren't brought home from the hospital until the day Richard Nixon resigned the office of the presidency. His mother saved the local paper from that day, and he attributes his distaste for political corruption, in part, to this historical accident. Arnold met his wife Cindy in 1991 at an honors program for Georgia high school students, and they have been married since January 4, 1997. He and his wife now live in Kingston Springs, Tennessee, in a home they purchased in 2007, with their daughter Alice and their four rescue dogs. Arnold is an avid hunter and fisherman, and aspires to catch a fish in all fifty states by the time he dies. Professional career Military service After basic combat training, Arnold attended the Basic Modern Standard Arabic Language course at the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center at the Presidio of Monterey, California. While there, he was co-winner of the Commandant's award in a graduating class of 192 soldiers, marines, seamen and airmen studying a variety of languages. After signals intelligence training at Goodfellow Air Force Base in San Angelo, Texas, Arnold was stationed at Fort Drum, New York and was assigned to the recently formed First Brigade Combat Team of the 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry). While there, he earned his Air Assault badge and completed the Army's Warrior Leader Course. During his time at the 10th Mountain Division in the U.S. Army, Sergeant Arnold trained signals intelligence personnel in counter-insurgency missions for deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan and produced analysis that contributed to the removal of more than 24 high-level insurgents and dozens of lower-level insurgents from the Iraqi theater of operations. While serving in Baghdad, Iraq from August 2005 to August 2006, Arnold served on a four-man intelligence team credited with capturing the highest number of insurgent targets of any team of its type operating in the 4th Infantry Division's area of operations. His brigade received a Meritorious Unit Citation for its service during that deployment. By the time Arnold left the Active Duty Army, he was decorated with the Iraqi Campaign Medal (with two stars), the Army Commendation Medal, four Army Achievement Medals, two Army Good Conduct Medals, the National Defense Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Overseas Service Ribbon, the Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal and several other awards. He also held a top secret security clearance. In October 2010, Arnold was honorably discharged from the Inactive Ready Reserve. Legal experience Arnold has worked for the District Attorney's office in Nashville, Tennessee, where, pursuant to Tennessee Supreme Court Rule 7 Section 10.03, he was given authority to try and to manage misdemeanor and felony criminal cases under the supervision of Assistant District Attorneys as a legal intern. Between August 2010 and May 2011, he also worked at the Brentwood, Tennessee division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. After taking and passing the Tennessee Bar Exam in the Summer of 2012, Arnold began practicing law on his own. Mr. Arnold practices primarily in Dickson County and Cheatham County in Middle Tennessee's 23rd Judicial District. He practices out of a small office located across from the courthouse in Ashland City, Tennessee. While Arnold has taken some Juvenile and Chancery Court cases, his practice is primarily centered in the General Sessions and Circuit Criminal Courts. Since being licensed, Mr. Arnold has also handled cases in Chester, Carroll, Davidson, Maury, Robertson, Rutherford, Stewart and Williamson Counties. In August, 2014, Jack Arnold is expected to be listed as a candidate on the ballot for Circuit Court Judge in Tennessee's 23rd Judicial District, running for the seat currently occupied by Judge George Sexton. Judge Sexton is not expected to seek re-election at this time. Campaign for Congress Arnold filed with the Federal Election Commission to run as an Independent candidate for the seat held by 10-year incumbent Republican Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee's 7th congressional district. By the end of the election cycle, Blackburn had raised $1,779,731.00 and spent $1,408,633.00 on re-election compared to the $20,418.00 raised and spent by Arnold. Though no other candidates reported raising funds to the Federal Election Commission, by the time of the election, there were several other candidates on the ballot. Democrat Credo Amouzouvik, Independent Ryan Akin, Independent Lenny Ladner, and Green Party Candidate Howard Switzer. Despite appearing fifth on a ballot containing six names, Arnold received nearly as many votes with 4,256 as Mr. Switzer, who was listed third on the ballot, according to Ballotpedia. Issues Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) Arnold came out as an early opponent of SOPA and staunchly opposes the bill, which he has said \\"no thinking person could possibly support\\". Notably, Arnold's position starkly contrasts that of his Republican opponent Marsha Blackburn, who is one of SOPA's most prominent congressional cosponsors. Blackburn's support for SOPA became a major issue in the race for Tennessee's 7th congressional district on December 22, 2011, when in response to Blackburn's support for the bill, redstate.com's Erick Erickson, a high-profile conservative who has been described as the most influential conservative blogger on the internet, wrote \\"I am pledging right now that I will do everything in my power to defeat Marsha Blackburn in her 2012 re-election bid.\\"http://www.redstate.com/erick/2011/12/22/stopping-sopa/ Gun rights Arnold is a strong supporter of the right to bear arms, and argues that it is more important to defend the right to bear arms than to promote gun safety.

It is found growing on coral reefs in tropical parts of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Description Rice coral (Montipora capitata) growing over Porites sp. Porites lobata is a hermatypic or reef- building coral. It varies greatly in size and shape depending on its environment. On wave-exposed reef slopes it is encrusting whereas in calm water areas it can grow into large helmet-shaped or hemispherical hummocks up to high and wide. Growth rates are very slow, sometimes being as little as per year, and this means that large corals are very old. The general colour is greenish, yellow or tan because of the zooxanthellae, single-celled microalgae, that live symbiotically within the tissues. These make organic nutrients available to the polyps through photosynthesis.Porites lobata The Genome Institute. Retrieved 2011-12-19.Genus Porites, Family Poritidae: Porites lobata WetWebMedia.com. Retrieved 2011-12-19. The corallites are very small and closely packed. They are joined directly to one another by fused but porous walls and have diagnostic skeletal characteristics that are only visible under the microscope. The septa are also fused. The polyps are 1 millimetre (0.04 in) in diameter and the coenosarc covering the skeleton is thin. Distribution Porites lobata is a common species of coral and is found in the tropical parts of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The range extends from East Africa, the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, through Indonesia and Australian waters to the Pacific coasts of California and Central America. It is the most common coral species in Hawaii. It is often the dominant species on reef margins, in lagoons and on fringing reefs at depths down to . It occurs in a slightly deeper zone than cauliflower coral.Marine Life Profile: Lobe Coral Waik√Øk√Ø Aquarium. Retrieved 2011-12-19. Biology Porites lobata is gonochoristic which means that individual colonies are either male or female. Gametes are liberated into the water column and the developing planula larvae drift with the currents as part of the zooplankton. These later settle, undergo metamorphosis and develop into polyps which found new colonies. Mortality is very high and very few recruits are found in the Eastern Pacific. Fragments of coral that become detached from the colony may also develop into new colonies. Breakup may happen as a result of wave damage or it may be due to the skeletal structure of the coral being weakened by the boring activities of date mussels (Lithophaga spp.) or the feeding activities of fish such as the stone triggerfish (Pseudobalistes naufragium). Ecology Porites lobata forms part of the coral reef biome. Several fish species live among the lobes of the coral, some sheltering there and others, like the puffer fish (Arothron meleagris) grazing on the polyps. The snapping or pistol shrimp (Alpheus deuteropus) is a commensal and lives among the lobes where it may form grooves and tunnels. Threats Porites lobata is one of the more resilient species of coral. A rise in sea temperature may kill the zooxanthellae and cause bleaching, however, it is more resistant to bleaching than many corals and if bleaching does occur, it often recovers. Tropical reefs in general are under threat from many causes. These include El Nino events, ocean acidification which tends to dissolve the coral skeleton, trawling which results in mechanical damage to reefs, and coral diseases which kill the polyps. Due to the lack of coloration, this coral is very rarely collected for use in the aquarium hobby.

It is also the second tallest structure in South Asia after the guy-wire-supported INS Kattabomman in India. The tower is also the 11th tallest completed tower in Asia and it is also the 19th tallest tower in the world. It was first proposed to be built in the suburb of Peliyagoda but later the Government of Sri Lanka decided to shift the location. The lotus-shaped tower will be used for communication, observation and other leisure facilities, with construction costing $104.3 million, funded by EXIM Bank of People's Republic of China. It is visible throughout Colombo, its suburbs and most major highways radiating from and around the city. The tower was opened to the public on the 16 September 2019 by President Maithripala Sirisena, seven years after the project commenced. Lotus Tower, South Asia's Tallest Tower  Location  After an initial decision to construct the tower within the confines of a suburb of the country's economic capital city of Colombo, Sri Lanka's government announced their plans to shift the location to the heart of the city.

Design and function  The design of this building is inspired by the Lotus flower. The lotus symbolizes purity within Sri Lankan culture and is also said to symbolize the country's flourishing development. The tower base is inspired by the lotus throne and will also be formed by two inverted trapezoidal. The tower's color is planned to alternate between pink and light yellow by smooth transition- an effect achieved by coating the glass. The tower is approximately tall and covers of floor area. Lotus Tower's main revenue sources will be tourism and antenna leasing. It will function as a radio and television broadcasting antenna ISDB-T and proposed DVB-T2 support structure for 50 television services, 35 FM Radio Stations and 20 telecommunication service providers, and will house a variety of tourist attractions . The tower has four entrances, with two being used as VIP (distinguished guests and state leaders) entrances. A telecommunications museum and restaurant are located on the ground floor. The tower podium consists of 6 floors. The first floor of the podium will accommodate a museum and two exhibition halls. The second floor will be utilised for several conference halls with seating space in excess of 500 people. Restaurants, supermarkets, and food courts will be situated on the third floor. A 1000-seat auditorium will be located on the fourth floor, which will also be used as a ballroom. The fifth floor will include luxury hotel rooms, large ballrooms, and the seventh floor will host an observation gallery. The landscaping is planned in the form of a large water park.

The Monorail was canceled in 2016, and instead, a light rail will be constructed in Colombo.  Controversy  During the opening ceremony which was held on 16 September 2019, President Maithripala Sirisena at a ceremonial speech mentioned and claimed an allegation on a scam regarding an advance of 2 billion rupees which was given to an approved company ALIT in 2012 by the then government, was later revealed in 2016 that such a company did not exist. However this was later proven to be false as ALIT was in fact the acronym of the Chinese state-owned Aerospace Long-March International Trade Co. ALIT denied receiving the payment claiming that the entire amount was paid to the China National Electronics Import & Export Corporation (CEIEC) as had ALIT left the project. It also noted that the TRC paid $15.6 million (2 billion rupees) into CEIEC's account in Exim Bank in October 2012, the same amount which Sirisena claims to have been \\"misappropriated\\" by ALIT.

He moved to Los Angeles in the 1880s and was married in 1890 to Nellie M. Squire. They had one son, George. The family lived on North Workman Street but moved in 1892 to 447 Temple Street.  Vocation  Dromgold taught school in his home town and then moved to Versailles, Missouri, where he worked with his brother as a wagon- maker for two years. After moving to Los Angeles, he formed a house- and sign- painting business partnership in June 1892 with Paul H. Fitzgerald under the name Star Sign Company. In November 1899, he was physically assaulted by two other sign painters, Albert M. Imelli and Otto Wieben, on the street in front of Dromgold's business in the Byrne Block;For more about the Byrne Block. see Pan-American Lofts a crowd gathered and separated the men, a policeman was called, the two assailants were arrested and they were fined $15 each in court. It was noted that Dromgold and Imelli had previously been partners \\"but they separated some time ago, and the feeling between them is not cordial.\\"  Community work  In 1890, Dromgold supported a plan to build a cable car line on Second Street (Angel's Flight) to rise up Bunker Hill, pledging $80 to the project at a mass meeting of the Crown Hills Improvement Society in Ellis College. He was one of the original members of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce and of the Merchants and Manufacturers Association. As president of the East Side Improvement Association, he \\"fathered\\" a bridge and viaduct plan for connecting Pasadena and Downey avenues and Buena Vista Street (the present North Broadway). At that time he was living at 127 North Gates Street. It was noted in 1906 that he had \\"large property interests.\\"  City Council   Election  Dromgold was a successful candidate for the City Council in the First Ward in 1906, nominated by the Democratic Party and the Non-Partisan organization. He was elected and served a three-year term before a new city charter put an end to the ward election system. He attempted a comeback in 1915, when he ran for election in a resurrected and refashioned first-past- the-post voting system, in which all candidates ran at large. He finished nineteenth in the primary election, in which eighteen candidates were nominated for the final.  Work on the council  His chief accomplishment was securing the erection of the Second Street Bridge across the Los Angeles River, which was inaugurated by President William Howard Taft in 1909. He was also one of the council members who voted in favor of the Owens River Project to bring water to Los Angeles from East Central California. Other highlights of his tenure: Dromgold was one of the early proponents of using voting machines in city elections, The city bought 52 of them in 1906 and the county bought 102 the same year, but none were ever used. \\"A little test will show that the machines will please the people and be a great economy for the public treasury,\\" he said. The councilman warned that private individuals and companies had filed for deeds with the city engineer for plats of land in the Los Angeles River bed, property that by rights belonged to the city \\"under the Mexican six-mile-square original grant.\\" He said the gravel rights in the wash were worth \\"thousands\\" to the city. The problem came to light when a \\"teamster\\" was arrested for taking material from the river bottom on land that was claimed by businessman Cal Forrester. Forrester began a recall movement against the councilman, but Dromgold did some personal investigation and found, he said, that Forrester's Bishop Street home was built on property that was owned by the city and was never vacated: He slipped a resolution through City Council calling upon the city attorney to investigate and to \\"dispossess any intruder\\" if it was found to belong to the city. The city attorney found that the land had been \\"dedicated many years ago for park purposes, at a time when there was a threat to located a pest-house in the vicinity.\\" The area was at the south end of Elysian Park. 'Me run for the council again?' In a similar vein, Dromgold ordered an ordinance prepared that would end the common practice of the city vacating portions of a public street simply because an adjacent property owner wanted to build on it. Adna R. Chaffee, chairman of the Board of Public Works, \\"agreed that the mere fact that land intended for public use is not now used is no reason why it should be vacated. He also thought the city should be reumunerated in such cases, just as it has to remunerate land when it is condemned.\\" The council approved an ordinance he introduced to forbid \\"swinging\\" electric signs more than thirty inches over the street or sidewalk, and Mayor Arthur C. Harper vetoed it three times on the grounds that business owners wanted to be able to put up larger signs. \\"My recent trip to San Francisco convinced me that we are making a mistake by not permitting the swinging electric signs here,\\" the mayor said. \\"At night Fillmore street there is a great white way. There are electric signs in front of almost every place of business.\\" A community meeting was called by C. H. Randall, editor of the Highland Park Herald, for the purpose of beginning a recall movement against Dromgold, but the stormy meeting of about seventy voters eventually ended with a vote endorsing the councilman's \\"honesty and integrity.\\" Note: Population of Los Angeles was 102,500 in 1900, six years before Dromgold's election, and 319,200 in 1910, when he left office.

The work was written with specific members of the RPO in mind, and is dedicated to the memory of the poet George Mackay Brown, who died on the day the symphony was completed. Character and materials The symphony sets out at the beginning from a slow Australian aboriginal tune, as reworked in Davies's Time and the Raven, composed the previous year, and returns to it at the end. Over the course of the symphony this theme is subjected to continual transformations . As with many of Davies's works from the time of the First Symphony onward, the Sixth Symphony establishes its own set of harmonic rules, with its own \\"tonics\\" and \\"dominants\\" . Instrumentation The symphony is scored for piccolo, two flutes (2nd doubling alto flute), two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, double bassoon, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, five percussionists (playing glockenspiel, crotales, marimba, two wood blocks, tambourine, side drum, two bass drums, two suspended cymbals, crash cymbals, rain sticks), harp, celesta, and strings. Analysis The symphony is in three movements: # Adagio ‚Äì Allegro # Adagio non troppo ‚Äì Allegro # Adagio ‚Äì pi√π animato After the presentation of the slow theme as an introduction, the first movement becomes a \\"scherzo masquerading as a sonata-allegro\\" . The opening Aboriginal-derived theme is clearly centred on E, and after wandering into other areas, the movement settles back onto E at the end, with one of the secondary pitches, B, above it . The second movement reproduces the pattern of the first in many respects: a slow introduction, followed by faster music over a slower-moving background, as a sonata-allegro masquerading as a scherzo‚Äîthe reverse of the first movement's disguise . The initial tonality once again focusses on E, but soon gives way to B and a collection of minor-third related centres: D, F and G. Later, the tonality shifts to B, D, and F and the movement closes with a violent passage successively centred on B, F, and finally D . After two fast movements the finale is essentially a slow one. Like the other two, it begins with an introduction, only briefer this time, followed by transformations now attempting to reconcile everything from the diverse elements of the first and second movements . This synthesis is reflected in the tonalities. When the Aboriginal theme returns at letter U, it is supported by a timpani tattoo, first on B, then on F, then alternating D, B, and F, finally settling quietly onto a low D. This leaves the ambiguous feeling that the tonic may be E and the dominant B, or the tonic may be B with dominants D, F, and G .

Structure NG2 cDNA contains 8,071 nucleotides corresponding to 2,325 amino acids. The entire protein is divided into three domains: a large extracellular domain (2,224 amino acids), a single transmembrane domain (25 amino acids), and a short cytoplasmic tail (76 amino acids). The extracellular domain is further subdivided into three subdomains: an N-terminal globular domain that contains several cysteines and is stabilized by intrachain disulfide bonds; a central domain to which the chondroitin sulfate moiety covalently binds; and a juxtamembrane domain also containing several cysteines. The core NG2 molecule is approximately 300 kDa and the addition of at least one chondroitin sulfate molecule results in a molecule that is 400 ‚Äì 800 kDa. Localization NG2 is found both in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripherally in a variety of tissues. In the CNS, NG2 may be found on pericytes, various tumors including glioblastoma, and a population of progenitor cells known as polydendrocytes or oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). Peripherally, NG2 is found on chondroblasts, cardiomyocytes, aortic smooth muscle cells, myoblasts, and several different human tumors, including melanoma. Although NG2 is a single-pass transmembrane protein, it may also be released by proteolytic cleavage into the extracellular space where it associates with the extracellular matrix (ECM). The levels of NG2 have been shown to increase rapidly at areas of injury in the CNS, including in the area of the glial scar of spinal cord contusion injury.Jones LL, Yamaguchi Y, Stallcup WB, Tuszynski MH. \\"NG2 is a major chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan produced after spinal cord injury and is expressed by macrophages and oligodendrocyte progenitors.\\" J Neurosci. 2002 Apr 1;22(7):2792-803.

He was also involved in the early days of Aberystwyth Town Football Club. Early life and education Hughes was born at Glynpadarn, near Aberystwyth, the son of Hugh Hughes, a local solicitor. He was educated at Shrewsbury School where he played \\"soccer\\" for the school first eleven in 1872‚Äì73. In October 1874, he was admitted to Jesus College, Cambridge as a \\"pensioner\\", graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in 1878. At Cambridge, he was awarded a blue in 1875, 1876 and 1877; in the latter year, he played alongside fellow future Wales international, John Morgan. Football career As early as 1873, Hughes and his brother, Hugh, are recorded as scoring three goals between them in a football match in Aberystwyth. Along with their elder brother, Arthur, the three men endeavoured to create a football club in the town, although it was not until October 1884 that the present club was formed, after Arthur placed an advertisement in the local press seeking \\"Gentlemen wishing to join the (Aberystwyth Football) Club\\". Jack Hughes was captain of the local side until he moved away in 1879. Hughes was described as the \\"first exponent of the association game\\" in Aberystwyth and it was later said of him: > The pre-eminence of Jack Hughes cannot be over-emphasized . . . he was one > of the best forwards in the United Kingdom. At that period, combination was > unknown and a single good player in a team counted a lot, so that > Aberystwyth in virtue alone of their possession of a footballer of so much > renown held a high place in the football world. Hughes's international debut came in the first international played in Wales, against Scotland on 5 March 1877. (The two countries had met the year before in Glasgow in Wales's first international match.) The match at Wrexham's Racecourse Ground ended in a 2‚Äì0 victory for the Scots. Hughes (now registered as an \\"Aberystwyth\\" player) was selected again two years later in April 1879, against the Scots; this match also ended in a Scottish victory, by a three- goal margin. Later career In 1879, Hughes left Aberystwyth and moved to London where he became a solicitor. He died in Bloomsbury in October 1914.

Sh√≤u is instantly recognizable. \\"He holds in his hand a large peach, and attached to his long staff are a gourd and a scroll. The stag and the bat both indicate fu happiness. The peach, gourd, and scroll are symbols of longevity.\\" His most striking characteristic is, however, his large and high forehead, which earned him the title \\"Longevity Star Old-pate\\". The Chinese character sh√≤u (Â£Ω) is usually found on textiles, furniture, ceramics and jewelry. The ideograph may appear alone or be surrounded by flowers, bats, or other good luck symbols, but will always hold a central position. Longevity is commonly recognized as one of the Five Blessings (w«îf√∫ ‰∫îÁ¶è - longevity, wealth, health, love of virtue, a peaceful death) of Chinese belief that are often depicted in the homophonous rendition of five flying bats because the word for \\"bat\\" in Chinese (f√∫ Ëù†) sounds like the word for \\"good fortune\\" or \\"happiness\\" or in this case, \\"blessings\\".Bartholomew, p. 24 In this arrangement, the sh√≤u ideograph sometimes takes the dominant central position, replacing the fifth bat. Other symbols in Chinese iconography that represent longevity include pine trees, cranes, spotted deer, special collectors' stones (sh√≤ush√≠ Â£ΩÁü≥), peaches, and tortoises.Duda, pp. 204-6 These are often depicted in small groupings to emphasize the central, symbolic meaning of the picture (for example, cranes standing amongst pine trees). Perhaps the most common Chinese auspicious saying concerning longevity is that found on scrolls in nearly every Chinese calligraphy shop in the world: sh√≤u shƒÅn f√∫ h«éi (Â£ΩÂ±±Á¶èÊµ∑), which can be translated as \\"May your life be as steadfast as the mountains and your good fortune as limitless as the seas\\". Since 2017, the version 10 of the Unicode Standard features a rounded version of the symbol (üâ¢) in the \\"Enclosed Ideographic Supplement\\" block, at code point U+1F262 (ROUNDED SYMBOL FOR SHOU). In names As a sign for a resonant cultural concept, the character became a part of many Chinese names (e.g. Palace of Tranquil Longevity in Beijing). The Japanese equivalent is Kotobuki Â£Ω; ÂØø (see Nakajima Kotobuki, Tsukasa Kotobuki). See also Jur≈çjin (Shou Laoren) and Fukurokuju.

He is considered the patriarch of the Salesian Province of Mumbai.J. Casti, \\"Fr. Aurelius Maschio,\\" The Memory of the Salesian Province of Bombay 1928-1998, ed. Peter Gonsalves (Matunga, Bombay: Province Information Office, Don Bosco Provincial House, 1998) 59. He died on 9 September 1996 at Mumbai.Casti 57-59. Early life Aurelius was the sixth of eleven children, in a family famous for its winery (Maschio wines).Cantine Maschio At the age of 10 he expressed his desire to be a priest; his parents sent him to the Don Bosco Institute at Sampierdarena, Genoa. After four years, he was sent to the aspirantate of Penango, in October 1923.Casti 57. Missionary in India In October 1924 he asked to be sent to the missions. He joined the missionary expedition at the Salesian Mother House, Turin, in 1923. He was only 15. On 2 November 1924 he set sail from Venice to Bombay. Landing in Bombay 15 days later, he and his companions boarded the train for Calcutta and then for Gauhati. He began his novitiate in Shillong towards the end of 1924. On 25 December 1925 he made his first profession. During his philosophical studies, he began to learn Khasi, and did so well that he was entrusted with the editing of the local religious magazine, Ka Ling Kristan. Aurelius did his practical training at Don Bosco Technical School, Shillong, and then began his theological studies, in 1930. He was ordained a priest by Msgr. Ferdinand Perrier, Archbishop of Calcutta, on 29 April 1933. He was just 24 years old.Casti 57. His first appointment was in Cherrapunjee, together with Fr Mlekus. When Fr Mlekus died a few months later of exhaustion, at the age of 31, young Aurelius was entrusted with the responsibility for the mission. He soon bought a plot of land, rebuilt the residence, and bought another plot where he settled the Salesian Sisters. He showed himself a good organiser and fund raiser.Casti 57. Pioneer in Mumbai The Salesian work in Mumbai had begun in 1928, with Fr Joseph Hauber and Fr Adolph Tornquist. They had been entrusted with the Mary Immaculate Institute, a small school and boarding for poor Goan boys at Tardeo. When Fr Tornquist fell ill, the provincial, Fr Eligio Cinato, asked the 27-year-old Fr Maschio to take his place. Fr Maschio came to Tardeo on 20 February 1937. Almost immediately he began proceedings to buy a plot of land on the outskirts of the city near King's Circle (now Maheswari Udyan) at Matunga. The sale was approved by the municipality on 16 July 1938.Casti 57. Thekkedath, \\"The Starting and Consolidation of the First Salesian Work in Bombay (1928-1950). The Memory of the Salesian Province of Bombay 1928-1998. Ed. Peter Gonsalves (Matunga, Bombay: Province Information Office, Don Bosco Provincial House, 1998) 19. When, in 1940, the Salesians had to quit Tardeo Castle, they moved temporarily to Cumballa Hill. In 1941 work began on the construction of the first building on the newly acquired property at Matunga. By 31 October 1941, the Don Bosco School and boarding shifted to Matunga.Thekkedath, A History of the Salesians of Don Bosco in India 1:290-292. When the Bombay dock explosion occurred in April 1944, Fr Maschio was quick to take advantage of the situation, by applying to take the debris to Matunga. The excellent playground of Don Bosco High School (Matunga) is due to this initiative and foresight.Thekkedath, A History of the Salesians of Don Bosco in India 1:298. The second block of the school building was commenced in 1949 and completed in 1952. Already in his first year in Mumbai, Fr Maschio began publishing a folder entitled Don Bosco's Madonna. This is now a monthly religious magazine with a circulation of almost 100,000 in India and elsewhere.Thekkedath, A History of the Salesians of Don Bosco in India 1:287. Fr Maschio is also the builder of the Shrine of Don Bosco's Madonna at Matunga, which is an Italianate church modelled in some way on the Basilica of Our Lady Help of Christians, Turin, built by St John Bosco. Fr Maschio and the other Italian Salesians in Mumbai were not interned by the British government during World War II, as happened with Italian Salesians in other parts of India. They were merely asked not to leave Bombay Island without permission, report to the police commissioner every Thursday, etc.Thekkedath, A History of the Salesians of Don Bosco in India 1:290. In 1953, after a rectorship of 16 years, Maschio was replaced by Fr Mauro Casarotti. He continued, however, as Rector of the Shrine, running the Shrine Office through which he continued to obtain funds for the rapidly expanding works of the Salesians in and around Mumbai. Among his friends and benefactors, he could count J.R.D. Tata.Casti 59-60. In 1972, the new Salesian Province of Mumbai was formed, with Fr Dennis Duarte as its first provincial. In 1970 the Italian government conferred on him the Knighthood of the Italian Republic, and in 1973 the title of Commendatore. The European Community also recognized him as head of a non- governmental organization, and entrusted him with the distribution of food to worthy social projects.Casti 59. Fr Maschio died in Mumbai on 9 September 1996. He is buried in the Shrine of Don Bosco's Madonna that he built. Fr Maschio Humanitarian Award In 1993 a lay group of volunteers formed the Diamond Jubilee Committee, and instituted the \\"Fr Maschio Humanitarian Award\\" for humanitarian achievements. In 1995, the 12th such award was given to Ms Kiran Bedi. Among other recipients of the award are Mother Teresa, Baba Amte, Archbishop Thomas Menamparampil of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Guwahati, Gladys Staines (1999), Julio Ribeiro (Indian police officer) (2000), and Gram Mangal (2003). Maschio Memorial Foundation In 1997, the Maschio Memorial Foundation was established at the headquarters of the Salesian Province of Mumbai at Don Bosco, Matunga. The Foundation strives to continue the work of Fr Maschio by strengthening the participation of the young and the poor in their own development. It is committed to facilitate projects that provide care, training and other support systems for the poor and the young. Bibliography *Alessi, Antonio M.

They described the show as combining the \\"haggling of Pawn Stars, the over- the-top customizing of American Chopper and a healthy dose of cleavage in a peppy package that resembles a hundred other small-business-based reality shows, except that the business in this case is the sale of deadly weapons\\". The reviewer notes that although some may be uncomfortable with the easy availability of guns in America, the audience of over 1 million viewers does not seem to have any such qualms.  Ratings  The season 2 premiere (April 26, 2012) drew strong ratings, up 50% on the season 1 premiere.  Cancellation and controversy  On December 17, 2012, Discovery announced the cancellation of the series. Discovery said the decision had been made earlier, it was only announced in December. A spokesperson said \\"Discovery Channel chose not to renew the series and has no plans to air repeats of the show.\\" The Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting is thought to have played a part in the decision. Additionally, in March 2013 Gunsmoke Guns was served a search warrant for the premises by the Internal Revenue Service as \\"part of an ongoing financial investigation\\" that had been underway for several years according to an agency spokesperson. This took place shortly after a reported February 27 burglary where twelve handguns and three rifles were stolen by thieves who broke in through the roof of the shop. There was also speculation in the press that the IRS investigation was the result of Gunsmoke operator Rich Wyatt's remarks regarding pending Colorado legislation regarding gun purchase and ownership. In the last episode of season one, a man identified later as Wylie Newton attempted to sell an antique Colt pistol that had been stolen from a museum in New Mexico. A fan of the show that was familiar with the robbery recognized the gun and alerted authorities. On March 10, 2017 a federal jury convicted Rich Wyatt on ten felony counts related to conspiracy, fraud and tax evasion. The jury found that Wyatt had failed to report 1.1 million dollars to the IRS. Furthermore it was revealed Wyatt had negotiated a deal with Discovery Channel when in fact he never did have federal firearms license, though instead used a straw license through Triggers, a gun store in Castle Rock. Wyatt was sentenced to 78 months (6.5 years) in prison.  Music  The opening theme music is ‚ÄúTallahassee‚Äù performed by Swamp Cabbage.According to the ending credits of the show.

Sachs Building This office and retail building was designed by the firm of Leichenko and Esser, the design team that executed the Narragansett Apartments in the lakefront neighborhood of Hyde Park. The camel insignia that abundantly decorates the building's exterior is a version of the logo that decorated Hump Hair Pin packages, which is why local Poles colloquially referred to the structure as \\"pod wielb≈ÇƒÖdem,\\" which translates into English as \\"the building beneath the camel\\". Colloquially known as \\"the Hump building\\", it was built in 1930 for Sol Goldberg, an entrepreneur who made his fortune by redesigning the hairpin. Goldberg's \\"hair pin with the hump\\" was a U-shaped wire with a \\"non-rust satin enamel finish,\\" a few crinkles on each side, and the company's signature innovation: a strand-grabbing short third arm in the center. Goldberg survived the bobbed hair trend by creating a bobby pin, but by 1947 the Hump was home to the Morris B.

The store closed in the 1960s, and the building passed through several subsequent owners.

The episode originally aired on Fox in the United States on January 15, 2012. In the episode, Peter meets Stella, the new worker who replaces Opie and is deaf. Quagmire falls for her and decides to have a party for disabled women at the bar, where Brian meets a blind girl named Kate and decides to date her. Meanwhile, Lois replaces the stairs after Stewie gets a splinter, but Peter constantly slips and falls down them and eventually decides to stay upstairs for good. The episode was written by Cherry Chevapravatdumrong and directed by Bob Bowen. It features the guest performances of Jessica Barth, Carrie Fisher, Sara Fletcher, Hunter Gomez, Christine Lakin, Marlee Matlin, Tara Strong, Nana Visitor, and Robert Wu, along with several recurring voice actors for the series. It received mostly positive reviews.  Plot  After Opie gets fired from the brewery (apparently for excessive on-the-job masturbation), Peter's new co-worker is a very attractive deaf woman named Stella. Quagmire stops by to visit Peter and is smitten by her, so he puts together a \\"Disabled Ladies Night\\" at the Clam. While the gang is there, Brian sees an attractive blonde woman named Kate at the bar and successfully asks her out, only to learn that she is blind. They have a very nice first date but Brian is horrified to learn that Kate hates dogs. He decides to pretend to be a very hairy human, and wins her over by lying at length and by turning down offers of sex. He uses her blindness in various ruses, such as pretending he has taken her to the symphony when they are actually in the Griffins' garage. When Kate's parents come to visit her and invite her and Brian to dinner, Brian enlists Stewie to help him with another ruse: this one has Brian wrapped up in bandages and Stewie posing as his post-burn treatment nurse. Stewie even cuts off Brian's wagging tail and cauterizes the bleeding with a candle to keep up the charade, until Brian finally tells Kate the truth about himself. But Kate says that while she would have gotten over her anti-dog beliefs, she is through with Brian because he lied to her. However, Brian, on Stewie's advice, manages to use a different voice to continue his relationship with Kate. Elsewhere, Stewie gets a splinter from the house's badly decaying staircase, and Lois decides to replace it (while she ignores a fallen roof beam and the fact that it's trapped Meg in the living room for two days). Everyone likes the new stairs except for Peter, who falls down them in a cursing tirade and severely injures himself whenever he tries to leave the top floor. He later decides he's just going to live upstairs, so Lois reluctantly has the old stairs reinstalled, and Peter is happy once more.  Reception  In its original broadcast on January 15, 2012, \\"The Blind Side\\" was watched by 8.50 million U.S. viewers and acquired a 4.4/10 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, a significant increase in ratings from the previous week's episode, \\"Meg and Quagmire.\\" This also makes it the highest-viewed episode since season nine's \\"New Kidney in Town\\", which was viewed by 9.29 million people. Critical reaction was fairly positive. Kate Moon of TV Fanatic did not think Peter's staircase subplot line was funny, and also thought the show should have used Marlee Matlin for more than just a few lines in the beginning, but she did think the episode was funny, specifically praising Stewie's moments in the episode. Ultimately, she gave the episode a 3.5 out of 5. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, saying \\"The cutaways that came out of this plot didn‚Äôt work for me, particularly Peter‚Äôs contraption that lifts Joe up, leading him to ecstatically believe that he‚Äôs dead and is rising to Heaven. The potshots at True Blood and Showgirls also fell flat because they felt like beating a dead horse, but I‚Äôll take what I can get. When the main plot makes coherent sense, the B-plot makes me laugh consistently through simple but effective comedic escalation, and the cutaways don‚Äôt fill the room with groans, Family Guy succeeds. This is a decidedly above-average episode, and one that didn‚Äôt get dragged down by the little bits that didn‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs not as good as ‚ÄúBack to the Pilot,‚Äù which remains the high water mark of the season so far, but ‚ÄúThe Blind Side‚Äù can rest comfortably in second place for now.\\"  References   External links   Family Guy (season 10) episodes 2012 American television episodes ","title":"The Blind Side (Family Guy)"},{"id":"34144897","text":"Carlos Humberto \\"Pepino\\" Toledo (10 August 1919 - 13 April 1980) was a Guatemalan football forward and coach who played the entirety of his professional career for CSD Municipal and was a member of the Guatemala national team. Toledo was from 1938 to 1955 one of the first stellar players of the Guatemalan top flight during its beginnings, helping Municipal win four titles in seven seasons and being the top goalscorer of the league four times. With the national team he participated in four editions of the Central American and Caribbean Football Championships and twice at the Central American and Caribbean Games, and went on to become the team's top goal scorer. Club career Having played in several amateur teams during his early years, Toledo, who played as a forward, was discovered in the late 1930s by CSD Municipal coach Manuel Felipe Carrera who brought him to his team. In 1938, in the first ever match played by Municipal in the Liga Capitalina (the top division), Toledo scored twice against IRCA in a 2-2 draw. Later that season he would score five goals in one match against Aduana Central, giving his team a 5-4 win. He would finish the season with 15 goals, three behind the top scorer, Tipograf√≠a Nacional's Roberto Calder√≥n, as Municipal finished in 2nd place. In 1942 the top division was renamed Campeonato de Liga and a new era would begin. In a tight race with Tipograf√≠a (Tip Nac), whom by then had attained a bitter rivalry with Municipal, the latter won the tournament, with \\"Pepino\\" scoring 15 goals in 12 matches, in what was his first of four consecutive years as the top goalscorer of the league. He contributed with 26 goals in 14 league matches to Municipal's second league title in 1947, affirming his status as one of the great players of his time. For the second time in his career he scored five goals in one match, in a 9-1 win over Guatemala FC. Municipal won its third league title in the 1950-51 season, and after that, a friendly tournament called Cruz Roja (Red Cross), was played, where they beat four other teams from Central America and Mexico, thanks in part to \\"Pepino\\" scoring 6 goals in five matches. On 5 June 1955, in the final week of the 1954-55 season, he scored a goal in a 4-1 win against Tip Nac, which would be his last regular league match. The following week Municipal played a final series against new rivals Comunicaciones, losing the first leg 0-1, and coming back on the second leg with a 2-0 win, with goals by \\"Pepino\\" and \\"Soldado\\" de Le√≥n, which gave Municipal their fourth league title, putting the club ahead of Tip Nac four championships to three since the inception of the new league structure in 1942. Toledo would retire having scored and having won the national championship on his last professional match, http://dca.gob.gt:85/archivo/20110425/deportes3.html having scored 129 official goals during his entire career, which as of 2011 remains the fifth highest total in the history of the club.

Three years later, Toledo scored two goals at the VI CCCF Championship, against Panama and Nicaragua. On the last day of the same tournament, he played his last international match, a 0-3 loss to hosts Costa Rica, being substituted at halftime. https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SaccAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=y3kEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=1356%2C7762197 Overall, he scored 25 international goals, setting a national team record that lasted until 2002 when Juan Carlos Plata surpassed it. Coaching career and later years Shortly after his retirement from playing, Toledo started a new phase of his life in football, as a coach. He managed Municipal from 1957 to 1961, winning the domestic cup twice, in the 1957-58 and 1959-60 seasons. He died in 1980 in a road traffic accident.

Sardar Fateh Mohammad Khan after toppling the rule of Shah Shuja in Peshawar, laid the foundation of this huge garden in 1810. The garden consists of four enclosures and has a pavilion, mosque, football ground, two spacious lawns, pond along with fountains, and old trees planted in it.http://www.khyber.org/articles/2003/WaningGloryofWazirBagh.shtml Together with Shahi Bagh, Wazir Bagh is considered one of the oldest and largest gardens in Peshawar. They both hold a great historical value for the people and the region. According to old accounts, the garden was full of apricots, peaches, pomegranates, pears and colorful flowers. English envoy Sir Alexander Burnes rested in the garden during his trip in 1832.http://www.rasoulnews.com/news/Details.asp?index=7169 The garden holds a significant historical value, it however has lost its fabulous touch due to growing population and local people having less awareness of the historical heritage. It's almost deserted now, its greenery is dying, and is surrounded by newly built buildings.http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=70170&Cat;=7 It was used as a picnic spot in the past and especially its Peepal trees were considered its beauty.

The largest number of van der Westhuizens can be found in Africa, but because of immigration large numbers of van der Westhuizens can also be found in Argentina, Australia, United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and the United States of America. Van der Westhuizens have had a notable presence in South African history, most notably the Great Trek, First Boer War and the Second Boer War, as well as strategic campaigns in both World Wars.  Family history  The origins of the family name began with Pieter Jansz van der Westhuizen, a native of Brugge. The first record of Pieter Jansz's arrival in Cape Town is in 1662 as a soldier for the Dutch East India Company, where he changed his name to van der Westhuizen from Westhuysen. Later Pieter Jansz worked as a servant for Tieleman Hendricks till the late 1660s. Pieter became a Free Citizen ('Vryburger' in Afrikaans) in 1670 along with Hendrik Coester, and in 1673 he married Maria Hendrickz Winkelhuisen, the German widow of Hendrik Barentsz, adopting her three children. Together they had seven children (Maria, Johannes, Claas, Barent, Hendrik, Helena, and Pieter). In 1706 Pieter married Eva Gerritsz Ligthart (widow of Jan Douwensz Mos) from Amsterdam, after the death of Maria earlier that year. On 23 March 1677, the Cape Council of Policy granted land to Pieter Jansz van der Westhuisen and Willem Schalkszoon van der Merwe in the region of Hout Bay to develop agriculture in the region. Van der Westhuizen founded the largest farm in Hout Bay known as Kronendal, which became a very prosperous piece of farmland in the Cape and even received visits from Simon van der Stel. The farmlands of Kronendal are the oldest farmlands still in use in South Africa. Maria van der Westhuizen was the daughter of Pieter Jansz van der Westhuizen, and was raised on the family farm of Kronendal. Maria received much fame for her wealth, real-estate and was the founding ancestor of both the Van Niekerk and the Walters families. Maria left her fortune to her seven sons, which consisted of 83000 guilders, 35 slaves, 1400 sheep, 25000 vines and 10 farming estates (Mosselbank, Brakkefontein, Sandvliet, Slot van Paarl, Meerendal, De Grendel, Hoorenbos (8900 guilders), De Tijgerberge (21600 guilders), Drooge Vallei (15000 guilders) en Zeekoeivallei (1209 guilders)). Because of the inheritance left from Maria to her seven sons who each received about 12000 guilders, they were able to have a significant influence on the economy of the Cape after Maria's death in 1734.

Note that above the Free State town of Heilbron is another settlement indicated as Westhuizen, also note that 'w' is replaced with 'v' in names such as \\"Vitvaters Rand\\". It is thus possible that at one point in time a town or area was named \\"Westhuizen\\".

The plot follows two detectives, a veteran male cop (Song Kang-ho) and female rookie (Lee Na-young), who discover that the serial killer they are after is not human, but instead a dog. Plot Mapo district, Seoul. Middle- aged police detective Jo Sang-gil (Song Kang-ho), a single father with a young son and daughter, is assigned the seemingly straightforward case of a man, Oh Gyeong-il, who set fire to himself inside a car. Chafing at his lack of promotion after so long on the police force, but under pressure from his boss- cum-friend (Shin Jung-geun), he also grudgingly agrees to work with rookie detective Cha Eun-young (Lee Na-young), a 30-year-old divorcee who has just been transferred from motorcycle patrol duty. The dead man, who had drugs in his system, has a large dog-bite on his thigh but no fingerprints. The police discover the immolation was not suicide but was triggered by a timer in the victim's trouser belt. Sang-gil traces the sex club the victim had visited but bawls out Eun-young when she makes an amateurish error during a fight. Against protocol, Sang-gil omits to file reports on the progress of the case, as he wants to earn all the kudos himself and thereby a promotion. His boss finds out, just as a second victim, Nam Sang-hun, is found bitten to death by a large dog or wolf. After talking to dog-trainers, the police learn the man they need to see is Min Tae-shik, a retired police dog trainer who lives with his drug addict daughter; during a raid on his house, Min escapes and a wolf- dog subsequently kills a woman in the backstreets. Eun-young starts questioning police-dog trainers, as well as investigating those missing or dead, and comes up with the name of Kang Myung-ho, who supposedly committed suicide a while ago. She sets off to investigate on her own. After 4 people fell victim to the dog, Eun-young investigate Tae-shik's home. From the house she discover he has been training his dog, Jil-Po, to kill 6 targets, including a police named Bae. She found Jung-ah in a hospital and gather more information where found that Jung-ah was used as prostitute by the 5 victims. We then switch to a corrupt cop and Min, a businessman who paid him to kill Oh Gyeong-il before. Their deal went awry and the businessman kill him, make it look like a suicide and left a fake last will. Police Department freeze the case after their death but Eun-young still bothered by the unknown 6th man. Police Department later declare that they will start a hunt to kill the dog. Eun-young and Sang-gil use this information to then convince Young-jin to tell them who is the final target, which is revealed to be a minister. Noticing that all 5 of his henchmen are dead, the minister remember that Jung-ah used to tell him about his dad who was a dog trainer. He then plot his escape using boat. Eun-young later demoted to patrol police by their chief. The police department then setup an ambush using Jung-ah's cloth in their old house. The ambush fail and Eun-young follow Jil-Pong to an old house where the minister prepare to escape. During the ensuing fight Sang-gil shoot and kill Jil-Pong while he bites the minister, which he later explain that he missed.

It was proposed by Realis Estates, and was a planned regional shopping centre which was due to open in 2016. The centre was to include a Marks & Spencer department store, a wide range of new stores and shops, caf√©s and restaurants, 'vibrant public spaces', a Cineworld cinema complex, an 80-room hotel, parking for 1,000 cars and a new bus station. City Sentral's proposed catchment comprised 870,000 people with more than 360,000 people living within 20 minutes drive of the city centre. The architects for the bus station were Grimshaw Architects and Benoy was working on City Sentral. The branding of the proposed shopping centre divided residents in the city with many suggesting the deliberate misspelling of the word 'central' was unnecessary and open to ridicule. City councillors were asked to support a motion demanding Realis changed the name but it was rejected on the grounds that it may deter inward investment.  History  The ¬£350 million regeneration project was intended to transform a prominent but run-down site comprising the existing East West Precinct and bus station. An outline planning application was submitted in October 2008 and consent was granted in February 2009. The Development Agreement was signed in December 2009. Work on phase 1 (the new bus station) commenced on January 30, 2012 and was completed on March 26, 2013. In August 2013, the City Council asked Realis to present finalised plans or lose the contract. No progress was made and the scheme was effectively abandoned in December 2014. A scaled down proposal dubbed Unity Walk was subsequently submitted, but this was in turn abandoned in July 2018. The future of the site is now uncertain.  Stoke-on-Trent's Mandate For Change  City Sentral was part of Stoke-on-Trent City Council's \\"Mandate for Change\\" strategy that hoped to see ¬£1.5 billion worth of private and public money invested in the city. As well as City Sentral, regeneration projects included the new CBD office scheme, new homes, new schools and the new University Quarter, new roads and other infrastructure plus new public realm across the city centre.  Leisure  City Sentral was to include 11 restaurant and cafe units and an 80-room hotel.  Bus Station  Grimshaw Architects was appointed to work on the bus station in 2010 following an international design competition that attracted more than 40 entries. The low rise building with its dramatic sweeping roof and glass atrium and public spaces, has been designed as a landmark gateway to the city centre. The bus station contains 22 new bus stands (2 of which are in the open and without any cover from the elements) and includes comfortable enclosed waiting areas, accessible toilets, CCTV and one solitary shop. Construction for the bus station was due for completion in 2012, but this was later put back to January 2013 and then to April 2013. The delay was blamed on the fact that the planners were unaware of coal mines running directly under the construction site which affected the building of foundations. It has also been realised that the plans do not allow room for buses to wait between passenger runs, so an area on the Park and Ride car park on Hinde Street in Hanley was set aside for buses to be parked while not in use. Permission was given for the Spar supermarket which is the main retailer on the station to sell alcohol between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m., which aroused some public opposition because of the problems of anti-social behaviour associated with alcohol on the old Hanley bus station. The bus station was completed on March 26, 2013.
