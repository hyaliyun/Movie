PAM was in effect Canada's standing army, consisting of one regular infantry regiment and two cavalry regiments in 1914. The counterpart to PAM was the Non-Permanent Active Militia (NPAM), which referred to the reserve force of the Canadian Militia. PAM and NPAM were distinct forces from the sedentary militias raised in Canada. Both organizations were reorganized into the Canadian Army in 1940. History As the British began to withdraw soldiers from British North America in the decades after the War of 1812, the Parliament of the Province of Canada passed the Militia Act of 1855, creating the Active Militia. The Active Militia, later split off into the Permanent Active Militia (PAM), the Militia's regular armed unit (although it continued to use the label militia), and the Non- Permanent Active Militia (NPAM), the Canadian Militia's military reserve force. After PAM's formation, the remaining sedentary militia regiments that made up the Canadian Militia were collectively referred to as the Reserve Militia. Following Canadian Confederation in July 1867, PAM was managed by the Canadian Minister of Militia. PAM was mobilized on a number of occasions in the latter half of the 19th century, including the Fenian raids, the Wolseley expedition, the North-West Rebellion, and the Second Boer War. The Second Boer War saw more than 8,000 volunteers raised for service in South Africa, from a number of militia regiments in Canada, including PAM. =20th century= Citadel Hill. A number of administrative reforms were instituted after the war, with the establishment of the Canadian Army Service Corps in 1901, and the Canadian Military Engineers, Canadian Army Medical Corps, Canadian Ordnance Corps, and the Signalling Corps in 1903. On 1 April 1914, PAM had an authorized force of 3,110 soldiers of all ranks, and 684 horses. It comprised two cavalry regiments (Royal Canadian Dragoons, Lord Strathcona's Horse), the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery, the Royal Canadian Garrison Artillery, and the Royal Canadian Regiment. PAM was not directly mobilized during World War I; with Canadian soldiers serving overseas enlisting the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF), a separate force managed by the Ministry of Overseas Military Forces. However, the Royal Canadian Regiment, an infantry regiment under PAM, was deployed to Bermuda in order to relieve the 2nd Battalion, The Lincolnshire Regiment from garrison duty. The members of the regiment were later redeployed to France in November 1915, where its members were integrated with the CEF. As World War I drew to a close in 1918, and the CEF expected to disband, plans to re-organize the Canadian Militia were initiated under the Otter Commission. The Commission proposed that PAM field a force of six infantry divisions, one cavalry division, supplemented by personnel from NPAM. Additionally, the Otter Commission saw links of perpetuation created, for battle honours earned from units of the CEF with units of the Canadian Militia. Following the results of the Otter Commission, two more infantry regiments were integrated into PAM, 22nd Battalion (French Canadian) of the CEF (later renamed the Royal 22nd Regiment), and Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry. In the midst of demobilization after the end of World War I, PAM strength was reduced to nearly its pre-World War I levels, with 381 officers, and 3744 soldiers of other ranks. The force would maintain this relative size until the eve of World War II. In 1923, PAM was tasked with the operation of the Northwest Territories and Yukon Radio System. In the Interwar period, PAM was occasionally mobilized in order to maintain \\"peace,\\" between strikers and business owners during strikes. From 1932 to 1936, PAM was involved in the operation of unemployment camps, jointly with the Department of Labour. At the outbreak of World War II in 1939, PAM fielded a force of 455 officers, and 3,714 soldiers of all other ranks. During World War II, the Permanent Force was renamed the Canadian Army (Active); it later became known as the Canadian Army Active Force, Canadian Army (Regular), and Force Mobile Command following Unification on February 1, 1968. On July 8, 2013, by order of the Minister of National Defence, the name reverted to the Canadian Army.

The film stars Michael Caine and Andrea Marcovicci. Caine plays Jon Lansdale, a comic book artist who loses his hand, which in turn takes on a murderous life of its own. The original film score is by James Horner, in one of his earliest projects. Warner Bros. released the movie on DVD on September 25, 2007. Plot Jon Lansdale (Michael Caine) is a comic book illustrator, whose relationship with his beautiful wife Anne (Andrea Marcovicci) and daughter Lizzie (Mara Hobel) is on the rocks. While driving, Anne and Lansdale end up behind a slow-moving truck and an impatient driver behind them. In the heat of an argument, Anne accidentally pulls back too fast while Lansdale is waving down the truck driver, causing his right hand to be completely severed. Anne attempts to find the severed hand but it is too late. Lansdale then starts a painful adjustment to not having his drawing hand, while Anne deals with the guilt of having caused the accident and tries to get closer to her husband. Lansdale attempts unsuccessfully to recover the hand himself, though he does find his signet ring that Anne gave him. The couple move to New York and Lansdale is approached by his friend and agent Karen Wagner (Rosemary Murphy) to co-produce his comic with another artist, David Maddow (Charles Fleischer). Lansdale however, begins to show signs of a mental breakdown, and when he shows the test boards to Karen, they are all marked up. The deal is off and Karen fires Lansdale, who cannot recall marking up the boards while questioning his daughter about the incident. In a fit of frustration, Lansdale loses his signet ring. Anne is unable to cope with Lansdale's increasingly erratic behavior and general instability. Lansdale becomes jealous of Anne's yoga instructor and begins his slow descent into total darkness when an encounter with a homeless man (Oliver Stone) leaves the man dead at the \\"hand\\" of his former appendage. It's not entirely clear whether or not this was a real event or something in his mind. Lansdale begins having hallucinations about various inanimate objects coming to life as a hand, like a shower faucet. After his final meeting with Wagner, Lansdale comes forth with his intention to take an offer to teach at a small community college in California. At the suggestion of his friend Brian (Bruce McGill), Lansdale rents out a cabin in the woods for the time being. While the majority of his students fail to show an interest in comic books, this is not the case with Stella (Annie McEnroe), who also takes a personal interest in Lansdale. Annie insists on staying with Lansdale during the Christmas season, and he begins to have violent hallucinations about the hand strangling her. That night, the missing ring reappears on Lansdale's pillow. Lansdale and Stella begin a romantic relationship despite the latter showing an interest in Brian. Not long after, Lansdale meets Brian at a bar, but is confused as he should be on a two-week vacation with Stella. He soon learns that Brian hasn't seen her since she last went to Lansdale's cabin. Lansdale picks up Anne at the airport, but soon realizes she has no real intention of staying as she previously claimed. He hallucinates the hand strangling her, causing the car to crash in a fiery explosion. While his wife and daughter are at the cabin, Lansdale confesses to Brian that he slept with Stella. Soon after, Brian is killed in his car by the hand. That night, Lansdale awakens to see the hand trying to kill Anne. Lizzie overhears the commotion and calls the police, and Lansdale chases the hand outside into the nearby barn. The hand tries to attack him, but Lansdale stabs it. The hand crawls to a nearby spare tire and explodes into a puff of smoke, before wrapping itself around Lansdale's throat and causing him to lose consciousness. Lansdale awakens to find his own hand (the one attached) around his throat while the police skulk around. The sheriff, with Lizzy, and his deputies attempt to ask Lansdale what happened. Discovering that Anne is still alive, Lansdale attempts to explain what happened when the officers notice a pungent smell permeating the area in the carport around the car, specifically from the trunk. Lansdale tries to prove that nothing is wrong by opening the trunk, only to be horrified by the sight of Stella and Brian's dead bodies stuffed inside. At a local insane asylum, a psychologist (Viveca Lindfors) is trying to communicate with Lansdale. She wants him to remember and admit that it was him, not his severed hand, who killed all the victims. He says that the hand wants to kill her because it hates her. Suddenly, the hand (which apparently existed all along) appears from behind the psychiatrist and strangles her. Lansdale, completely taken over by the essence of the hand, looks at her dead body and starts to laugh. He loosens the restraint on his other hand and gets up, presumably to escape from the asylum.

Like Seizure, The Hand is a horror film and is derived from a similar premise (an artist's slow descent into madness). The general plot, themes, and characters of The Hand resemble those of The Hands of Orlac and The Beast with Five Fingers, leading some to declare The Hand an unofficial remake or spiritual adaptation of the aforementioned works. The film was shot partly in Big Bear Lake, California. The film's special effects were provided by Stan Winston and Carlo Rambaldi. Several lifelike animatronic hands were built, each designed for a specific action or motion (i.e. crawling, walking, grabbing). \\"Mandro,\\" Prince Valiant/Conan The Barbarian-styled comic book character, was drawn by artist Barry Windsor-Smith, who at the time was a real-life illustrator for the Marvel Conan comics. = Casting = Oliver Stone's first choice for the lead was Academy Award-winner Jon Voight, who declined the role. Stone also approached other Oscar-winners Dustin Hoffman and Christopher Walken. Michael Caine, however, after the success of his previous film Dressed to Kill, was interested in making another horror film to earn enough to put a down payment on a new garage he was having built, and he agreed to take the part after talks with the director. Caine's experience with Stone resulted in their being friends later in life, although Stone and Caine have not worked together since. Critical reception The Hand has a Rotten Tomatoes approval rating of 11% based on 9 reviews, with a weighted average of 3.78/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 59 out of 100, based on 6 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Allmovie called the film \\"an overwrought misfire that is best left to horror film completists.\\" The Terror Trap gave it 2/4 stars, stating that the film was \\"Strictly for Caine filmography completists or Stone enthusiasts.\\" Rob Gonsalves from eFilmCritic awarded the film 2/5 stars, calling it \\"inescapably cheesy\\". Brett Gallman from Oh, the Horror! wrote, \\"Clearly out the Orlac and Beast With Five Fingers mode, The Hand is just as silly as the fictional comics drawn up by its protagonist, but Stone mostly plays it as a straighter-than-straight schizoid thriller that examines psychological breakdowns more so than the visceral fallout.\\" Vincent Canby from The New York Times gave the film a positive review, writing, \\"Mr. Stone's screenplay is tightly written, precise and consistent in its methods, and seemingly perfectly realized in the performances of the very good cast headed by Mr. Caine.\\" See also * The Hands of Orlac * The Beast with Five Fingers * Evil Dead II References External links  1981 horror films 1981 films 1980s psychological thriller films Films directed by Oliver Stone Orion Pictures films Warner Bros. films Films about comics Films about fictional painters American monster movies American films American supernatural horror films Films scored by James Horner Films shot in Big Bear Lake, California Films with screenplays by Oliver Stone Fictional body parts ","title":"The Hand (1981 film)"},{"id":"5725631","text":"Vidant Medical Center (previously, Pitt County Memorial Hospital) is a hospital located in Greenville, North Carolina.

It is the only level I trauma center east of Raleigh, and thus is the hub of medical care for a broad and complicated rural region of over 2 million people. Vidant Medical Center is the largest employer in Eastern North Carolina and 20th overall in the state. Vidant Medical Center is licensed for 861 beds and had 39,360 admissions in fiscal year 2009. Of the 861 beds, 734 are general beds, 75 are rehab beds, and 52 are psychiatric beds. The hospital has 35 operating rooms: 26 rooms are Shared Inpatient/Ambulatory Surgery; four rooms are C-Section; three rooms are Other Inpatient; two rooms are Endoscopy. The facility was originally known as Pitt Community Hospital and was located near downtown Greenville. In 1934, it changed to Pitt General Hospital, and then again to Pitt County Memorial Hospital (PCMH) in 1949. The hospital moved to West Greenville in 1951, and then to its current location in 1977. On August 17, 2011, it was announced PCMH will change their name to UHS Medical Center. The change failed to occur on the planned October 1, 2011. The UHS brand was taken, so the hospital system instead finally change its name to Vidant Medical Center. Vidant Health claims that Vidant is derived from the root \\"Vi\\" that is associated with \\"life\\" in Latin, and in fact \\"Vida\\" literally means \\"life\\" in Spanish.  History  = Origins = Pitt Community Hospital (PCH), the precursor to Pitt County Memorial Hospital, was the vision of Greenville physician, Charles Laughinghouse. In 1923, he and three other physicians raised $85,000 to build the privately owned PCH. The hospital created a relationship with East Carolina Teachers' Training School. The first home of PCH came in 1924. It was temporarily located in Downtown Greenville, above H.L. Hodges' Hardware Store, at 210 East Fifth Street. On September 7, 1923, more than 800 people attended a reception honoring the hospital. The first night, Pitt County had its first surgical operation, an appendectomy. PCH made its first move to a permanent home at the intersection of Johnston and Woodlawn Streets, east of downtown. The three-story hospital had 42 beds and two full-time physicians, with 16 nurses. From its opening, the hospital served as a place to train nurses. In 1930 a physician from Wilmington, T.M. Watson, started a practice for infants and children. By 1933‚Äì34, the Watson children's ward was built. Two additional wings were added to the east end to increase the bed capacity by 14 in 1935. In September 1935, the hospital split into two divisions to qualify for the Duke Endowment. Pitt Community Hospital became the professional division and Pitt General Hospital, became a non-profit organization. The Duke Endowment provided $1 per day for each charity patient. By 1939 an increase in patient admissions indicated that a new hospital would need to be built. It closed in 1951, once the new hospital opened. = Early expansions = By 1934, the hospital was renamed Pitt General Hospital and a children's ward was added. X-ray and laboratory equipment and eight more beds were added in two new wings. In 1940, the county commissioners made plans to purchase Pitt General, but World War II interrupted the plans. The Hill-Burton Act of 1946 provided the stimulus to construct a new hospital. Pitt County voters approved a $351,900 bond issue in 1947 to help with construction. A tract of land on the western edge of town was donated by the Jesse Moye family. Construction began on March 21, 1949. = Later expansions = In February 1951, Pitt County Memorial Hospital was opened with 120 beds and named for the county's World War II veterans. A few weeks before, on January 18, Secretary of the Army Kenneth Royall spoke at the dedication. A bond was passed in 1958 to increase the number of beds to 200. Its capacity was 205 by 1963, but the hospital was still too small. Local civic leaders, Charles Gaskins, Wilton Duke, and Joe Pou, helped facilitate the passage of a $9 million bond referendum for the construction of a new 350-bed hospital. The hospital employed approximately 80 physicians in 1972. The Department of Family Medicine was organized a year later. With help from both the bond and federal grants, construction began on the new hospital in 1974. A year later, the hospital and the medical school signed a joint affiliation agreement. The new hospital on a site opened in April 1977 with 355-beds. A larger rehabilitation center and the first class of the four-year medical students also started that year. A neonatal intensive care unit was established and East Carolina University (ECU) opened the Family Practice Center in 1978. A year later, a cardiac catheterization lab opened. The first kidney transplant was performed here in 1981 and the 138-bed West tower opened a year later. Level II trauma designation was achieved in 1983. The hospital performed its first open heart surgery in 1984. EastCare, the medical ground and helicopter transport, Level I trauma designation, Magnetic resonance imaging and laser surgery all began in 1985. The School of Medicine's and the hospital's pediatric services were all consolidated to the Children's Hospital of Eastern Carolina in 1986. By 1987, the hospital employed 2,300 people with 560 beds. The Ronald McDonald House began construction that year. During the 1990s, the 143-bed North Tower was constructed. Also, a new Heart Center, a 12-bed pediatric intensive care unit and a family birthing center were all built during the decade. Off site, the outpatient SurgiCenter opened. In the mid-1990s, hospital administrators realized the only way for the hospital to survive in the dynamic health-care environment that a change was needed. Privatization was a way to streamline the decision-making process to make it more competitive against other hospitals. A vocal group of residents did not want the hospital to change from public to private. The county commissioners decided for privatization by a narrow margin. The hospital went from a public, not-for-profit to private not- for-profit in 1998. PCMH came under the umbrella of University Health Systems of Eastern Carolina (UHS) in 1999; UHS manages or owns eight hospitals in eastern North Carolina. That year, the hospital employed 4,150. The Wellness Center opened in 2000 and the first successful procedure in the United States using the da Vinci Surgical System was performed by East Carolina University surgeon Randolph Chitwood. It was the second such procedure in the world. EastCare purchased its second helicopter and the hospital began construction of a four-story emergency department with a roof helipad that year. The Gamma Knife was brought to the hospital in 2005. Vidant Medical Center was designated a primary stroke center in 2007 by the Joint Commission. It is the only primary stroke center east of Interstate 95. The East Carolina Heart Institute at Vidant Medical Center, a way to reshape cardiovascular health in the state, was opened in 2009. That year, the hospital employed 7,373. In September 2010, a new interfaith chapel opened. The $2.3 million cost all came from private donations. The facility includes a 100-seat chapel, several meditation rooms and an outdoor reflecting pool. The hospital started operation on a Gamma knife system to help treat brain cancer in 2013. It is one of two in the state.  Vidant Cancer Center  In May 2014, Vidant Health announced plans for a new 6-story, 96-bed cancer facility set to open in 2018. The facility, which in all will encompass over 400,000 square feet, broke ground in March 2015. Some of the major features of the facility include 96 inpatient rooms with nurse, patient and family zones; an imaging center; infusion and radiation treatment clinics; and pharmacy and laboratory facilities. The facility will also include a number of courtyards, gardens, and other natural areas; as well as research and conference space.  James and Connie Maynard Children's Hospital  The James and Connie Maynard Children's Hospital is the only children's hospital in eastern North Carolina. The hospital treats infants, children, teens, and young adults aged 0‚Äì21. It sees over 42,000 pediatric patients a year. = History = The hospital was created in February 1986 when the School of Medicine and the hospitals pediatric services were all consolidated. Before the Children's Hospital was created, approximately 24 beds were designated for pediatric patients and two beds in the newborn nursery were reserved as neonatal intensive care beds when the new hospital opened in April 1977. On July 1, 1978, a 33-bed neonatal intensive care unit was opened; in February 1985 a new pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) was constructed. 1986 the Children's Hospital officially opened. A 12-bed PICU was completed in February 1995. The hospital operates under the \\"hospital within a hospital\\" concept. The hospital contains a 122 bed. Fifty beds are for the Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, a 16-bed convalescent nursery, and a high-risk obstetrical delivery service. Also, there are 42-beds for a New Born Nursery, 32-beds for Pediatrics, and 12-beds for a PICU. Over 6,500 children under the age of 21 are treated each year. A program housed in the hospital is Center for Children with Complex and Chronic Conditions (C5). C5 is a joint venture with the hospital and East Carolina University's Brody School of Medicine. The program promote optimal health, growth, development, safety, comfort and overall well-being for children with special health care needs. The hospital houses the inpatient, while an outside BSOM facility houses the outpatient functions. The program combines multiple fields of study including physicians, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, a respiratory therapist, a social worker and a child life specialist. The teams works with medically weak and machine-dependent children. The program is funded through The Duke Endowment. In September 2007 it was announced that a new children's hospital would be built. The Children's Hospital is expanding starting in 2010. The three phase project will be a free standing building. It will initially have four floors and will support future growth to six floors. The first phase for the $48.2 million project was completed in June 2013. It will increase the current Children's Hospital by . The overall theme will be aquatic will waves, bubbles and fishes. The first floor will include a Ronald McDonald suite for patients families, exam rooms, nine-bed Medical/Day unit for outpatient services and a theater. Also included will be a pediatric radiology department that will house ultrasound imaging, radiology, fluoroscopy and other interventions, pediatric observation unit and a family resource center. The lobby will have testing center, a caf√©, gift shop and breastfeeding support rooms. A play/therapy yard will include swings, basketball court, climbing structures and picnic tables. = Facilities = The second floor will have a 21 private bed convalescent newborn unit and a six-bed Kids Immunosuppressed Special Unit with a controlled environment for children with cancer, blood disorders, sickle cell disease, kidney disorders and other illnesses that compromise the immune system. Along with the new addition to the Children's Hospital, Vidant Medical Center is designing a pediatric emergency department. It will be a area near the existing emergency department. It will include 16 general pediatric emergency rooms, a dedicated resuscitation room, lobby area, ambulance entry and staff/support space. The $8 million project was completed in April 2012. On May 17, 2011, East Carolina University alumnus, James Maynard, founder of Golden Corral, and his wife Connie donated $10.5 million to the children's hospital. Nine million will go to the children's hospital itself, while the other $1.5 million will fund a distinguished professorship in the Department of Pediatrics. The new hospital will be named after them. The hospital is a part of the Children's Miracle network. Dr. Ronald Perkin and Dr. David Rodeberg serve as co-directors. = Patient Care Units = * A General Pediatrics Care Unit * Neonatal Intensive Care Unit * Pediatric Intensive Care Unit * Kids Immunosuppressed Specialty Unit * Pediatric Day/Medical Unit * Special Care Nursery * Children's Emergency Department * Pediatric Rehabilitation Unit * Pediatric Palliative Care Unit  East Carolina Heart Institute at Vidant Medical Center  The East Carolina Heart Institute at Vidant Medical Center opened in January 2009.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) granted a license to the site in June 2006 to the Oklahoma Space Industry Development Authority (OSIDA) to \\"oversee the takeoff and landing of suborbital, reusable launch vehicles\\". It also boasts the first space flight corridor, \\"The Infinity One\\"- which is about 152 miles long and averages about 50 miles wide - that is not in restricted airspace and does not interfere with Military Operations Areas (MOAs). The facility is an FAA licensed launch site, one of only 12 in the U.S. Individual operators must also secure a separate license in order to make space flights from the facility. Facilities The airpark is at the site of a public airfield known as Clinton-Sherman Airport . The airport covers an area of which contains two concrete paved runways: 17R/35L measuring 13,503 x with 1,000 foot overruns at each end for a total of 15,503 (4725.3 meters) and 17L/35R measuring 5,193 x 75 ft. (1,583 x 23 m). The larger of these, at 13,503 x 300 ft (4,116 x 91.4 m) is a major benefit for use as a spaceport. For the 12-month period ending June 30, 2020, the airport is on track for 30,000 aircraft operations, an average of 82 per day: 90% military and 10% general aviation. The location is a 2,700 acre (10.8 km¬≤) facility located near transportation corridors such as Interstate 35 and Interstate 40. There are 96 acres (384,000 m¬≤) of parking space able to support large commercial aircraft. There are six commercial aircraft hangars and a 50,000 square-foot (4,500 m¬≤) manufacturing facility with loading docks adjacent to a railway spur. History The facility operated for a number years as part of the United States Navy and United States Air Force. Closed under the name Clinton-Sherman Air Force Base, the facility has been redeveloped over the years to its present form. The location of the former naval air station World War II runways to the north and west of the main runway are still visible on aerial photographs of the airport; however they are not usable. Operations One company, Rocketplane Kistler, formerly based in Oklahoma, had plans to build and operate a suborbital spacecraft, the Rocketplane XP, but filed for bankruptcy in 2010 without having successfully launched a flight. Armadillo Aerospace conducted flight test Activities at the Oklahoma Spaceport in 2004 through 2009, including tests of a VTVL Lander and a Rocket Racer for the now- defunct Rocket Racing League. Large aerospace companies are attracted to the site not only because of the length and size of the runway, but also the fact that there are no obstructions around either end. Boeing in 2013 used the facility for testing an autonomous landing system for the 737, and in 2015 for proficiency training and flight testing with the 747-800. As of February 2020, Boeing intends to utilize the facility for flight tests on their 777X model, as well as for the recertification test flights of their 737-MAX. The former northeast 'alert pads' and ready facility of the former Strategic Air Command base currently houses the Law Enforcement Driver Training Center of the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, Oklahoma Department of Public Safety. Currently referred to as 'Building 120', the former bunker facility houses OHP Academy staff and cadets during the driving training portion of 'Patrol Schools'. The annual 'Cadet Lawman Academy' (sponsored by the OSTA, Elks Lodge, and C.U.D.D.), is also located at the same facility during the summer, which provides a 1-week program for high school students. The surrounding facility and tarmac incorporates over 12 miles of various roadways and courses, used for precision driving and emergency vehicle operation training. This facility is recognized as one of the top ranked law enforcement driver training centers in the country, according to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center.

The Non-Permanent Active Militia (NPAM) was the name of Canada's part-time volunteer military force from 1855 to 1940. The NPAM (also called \\"the Militia\\" though that term could also encompass the full-time standing army known as the Permanent Active Militia (PAM)) was composed of several dozen infantry battalions (redesignated as regiments in 1900) and cavalry regiments. With the withdrawal of the British forces in Canada after the turn of the 20th century, supporting corps were created in Canada as part of both the PAM and the NPAM. History The NPAM was established in 1855 by the Militia Act passed by the Province of Canada. After Confederation in 1867, militia units of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick were given three months to re-enrol in the militia of the new federation. At the beginning of the 20th century, NPAM did not provide Canada a standing army ready for immediate action, although it did provide the country the ability to mobilize a force should the need arise. In the decade prior to the start of World War I, the nominal strength of NPAM increased from 36,000 to 55,000 soldiers. The NPAM did not mobilize during the First World War, though large drafts of NPAM men went into the field force created in 1914 for that conflict, the Canadian Expeditionary Force. Some CEF units adopted regimental traditions from NPAM units. Following the war, the Otter Committee created a unique set of perpetuations, whereby the reorganized NPAM carried on the traditions of both the CEF and the prewar Militia in the Canadian Militia. On the eve of World War II, NPAM had 5,272 officers, and 41,249 soldiers of all other ranks. In 1940, the NPAM was redesignated the Canadian Army (Reserve); following World War II it was re-designated the Canadian Army Reserve Force, then the Canadian Army (Militia), and finally became the reserve component of Force Mobile Command following Unification on February 1, 1968. However, the historic title \\"Militia\\" continued to be applied to the reserve component of Canada's land forces.

Mayors, controllers, city councillors and school board trustees were elected in the municipalities of Toronto, York, East York, North York, Etobicoke and Scarborough. Art Eggleton narrowly defeated incumbent John Sewell to become Mayor of Toronto, and Mel Lastman was re-elected as Mayor of North York. Toronto =Mayoral race= In the 1978 election reform candidate John Sewell had won against two more conservative candidates. In 1980 election the right united around Art Eggleton, and he narrowly defeated Sewell. Eggleton carried eight of the city's eleven wards, dominating in the west end, and prevailing in North Toronto and the east end by narrower margins. While Sewell increased his vote in every ward, he only carried three wards in the heart of the city: midtown's ward 5 (which included the city's Annex district), the downtown core (ward 6) and ward 7, which he had previously represented as an alderman.John Sewell, How We Changed Toronto: The Inside Story of Twelve Creative, Tumultuous Years in Civic Life Toronto: Lorimer, 2015 ;Results :Art Eggleton - 87,919 :John Sewell - 86,152 :Anne McBride - 3,429 :Bob Bush - 2,141 :Fred Dunn - 1,100 :Armand Siksna - 867 :Ronald Rodgers - 846 :Chris Faiers - 590 :Andrejs Murnieks - 571 =City council= Ward boundaries used in the 1980 election City council saw a handful of major upsets and was considered to have been moved to the right by the election as in addition to losing the mayoralty reformers lost their majority on council. The most notable upset was in the downtown Ward 6. Incumbent Allan Sparrow had stepped aside to allow George Hislop to run, in the belief that the large gay community in the ward deserved a representative on council. Hislop was one of the leading gay rights activists in the city, and his campaign was vigorously opposed by figures such as evangelist Ken Campbell. In a surprise upset Hislop lost to little known local dentist Gordon Chong. Elsewhere the left won important victories. Tom Wardle Jr., who had been involved in several controversies including an assault conviction, was defeated by former councillor Dorothy Thomas. After four failed attempts Joe Pantalone won a seat on council by capturing the one vacated by Eggleton. Top two from each ward elected to Toronto City Council. Top one from each ward also wins a seat on Metro Toronto council. ;Ward 1 (Swansea and Bloor West Village) :William Boytchuk (incumbent) - 9,415 :David White (incumbent) - 8,345 :Bill Roberts - 5,785 :Brynne Teal - 4,267 :Nick Gulycz - 1,143 :Yvette Tessier - 742 :Michael Horner - 636 ;Ward 2 (Parkdale and Brockton) :Tony Ruprecht (incumbent) - 9,447 :Ben Grys - 4,923 :Susan Atkinson - 4,907 :Elaine Ziemba - 4,137 :Elaine Taylor - 684 :John Lauter - 620 ;Ward 3 (Davenport and Corso Italia) :Joseph Piccininni (incumbent) - 7,509 :Richard Gilbert (incumbent) - 7,363 :Edward Gardner - 1,246 :Mark Llewellyn - 689 ;Ward 4 (Trinity-Bellwoods and Little Italy) :Tony O'Donohue (incumbent) - 5,005 :Joe Pantalone - 3,898 :Tony Ianno - 3,362 :Bill Moniz - 2,898 :Barbara Hurd - 2,279 :Nick Figliano - 704 :Anthony Russo - 206 ;Ward 5 (The Annex and Yorkville) ;Ward 6 (Financial District, Toronto - University of Toronto) :Gordon Chong - 9,522 :Dan Heap (incumbent) - 9,341 :George Hislop - 7,348 :Rose Smith - 2,959 :Fred Chappell - 1,339 :Darryl Randall - 659 :Gary Weagle - 505 ;Ward 7 (Regent Park and Riverdale) :Gordon Cressy (incumbent) - 12,579 :David Reville - 9,066 :Frank Dwyer - 3,748 :Thelma Forsyth - 2,632 ;Ward 8 (Riverdale) :Fred Beavis (incumbent) - 9,172 :Thomas Clifford (incumbent) - 7,941 :Jeanne McGuire - 1,433 :James McMillan - 1,264 :John Coutts - 550 ;Ward 9 (The Beaches) :Pat Sheppard (incumbent) - 10,236 :Dorothy Thomas - 7,886 :John Oliver - 6,102 :Bob Yaccato - 5,321 :Tom Wardle Jr. (incumbent) - 3,206 :Winona Gallop - 915 ;Ward 10 (Rosedale and North Toronto) :June Rowlands (incumbent) - 17,551 :Andrew Paton (incumbent) - 15,201 :Patricia Bolton - 2,678 :Craig Roberts - 2,367 ;Ward 11 (Forest Hill and North Toronto) :Anne Johnston (incumbent) - 15,168 :Michael Gee (incumbent) - 13,410 :Kay Gardner - 6,700 :Susan Diamond - 1,447 Results are taken from the November 11, 1980 Toronto Star and might not exactly match final tallies.

He played a pivotal role in Operation Gulmarg .In British India of 1946, he won the Jammu and Kashmir State Assembly election as a member of the Muslim Conference party and became a member of the Praja Sabha under Maharajah Hari Singh. Jammu and Kashmir signed a stand still agreement with Pakistan as a result of the India Independence Act. In 1947, he instigated and organised the Poonch rebellion, and the Muslim League, the invasion of Jammu and Kashmir. He belonged to Sudhan tribe. This Pakistani sponsored tribal invasion, despite the stand still agreement was a rude shock to the King. He signed the Instrument of Accession with India \\"Instrument of Accession\\" and requested the help of Indian troops to liberate the region. The Prime Minister of India, Nehru also took the dispute to the United Nations as he could not stop the plunder and partial occupation by the invading militia. After fighting the Indian Army for 15 months, the Azad Kashmir militia accepted a United Nations-mediated ceasefire. Khan and his army were able to capture substantial portions of the three western districts of Kashmir, which were renamed Azad Kashmir. Khan was appointed the first President of tiny Azad Kashmir in 1948 by Pakistan. He represented Kashmir in different capacities at the United Nations from 1948 to 1971.Profile of Muhammad Ibrahim Khan, sardarsofkashmir.webs.com website, Retrieved 5 June 2017Masood Khan elected AJK president, Dawn newspaper, Published 16 August 2016, Retrieved 5 June 2017 Sardar Muhammad Ibrahim Khan also wrote a book named The Kashmir Saga on government and politics of Azad Kashmir and history and philosophy of freedom struggle. Early life and education Sardar Muhammad Ibrahim Khan was born on 22 April 1915 in Kot Mattay Khan, a village in the Poonch District of Kashmir. He received his primary education in his village. He attended college and received a Bachelors of Arts degree in 1937 at Islamia College (Lahore) and sought higher education abroad in 1938. He obtained his LLB degree from the University of London in 1941. Khan then obtained a law degree from Lincoln's Inn, and started practicing law at Srinagar, Kashmir. Professional & political career Under the Maharajah in 1943, Khan was appointed as a public prosecutor in Mirpur. He later worked at the State Advocate General office of Jammu and Kashmir. Then he left the government job to participate in the Kashmir liberation movement, and ran for and won the 1946 Jammu and Kashmir State Assembly elections. He went on to serve three more terms in office until he had to leave due to old age. He retired at the age of 86. He also established the Azad Muslim Conference. Role in 1947 independence struggle On 19 July 1947, Khan held a general assembly meeting at his residence where a resolution was unanimously passed for the State of Kashmir to join Pakistan. The Mahraja, Hari Singh, disapproved of his actions, and Khan left the state and went to Murree, Pakistan. In Murree, he gathered ammunition from private individuals and organizations. With several fellow Kashmiris, he launched a ‚ÄòJihad‚Äô against the Maharaja. On 24 October 1947, he defeated the forces of the Maharaja in the Poonch rebellion and founded the state of Azad Kashmir, which became a self-governing division of Pakistan. Role as President of Azad Kashmir As the first self proclaimed President of Azad Kashmir, he was invited by the United Nations to brief the General assembly on the situation in Kashmir. Under the leadership of Khan, the annual session of the All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference was held at Kotli in 1954, and a resolution was passed for the establishment of a proper Legislative Assembly in Azad Kashmir. While he and his lieutenants continued to push for a legislative assembly, it wouldn't be until the presidency of General Yahya Khan that the Azad Kashmir Legislative Assembly would be formed. Khan was elected president of Azad Kashmir for the second time on 13 April 1957, and for the third time on 5 June 1975. Sardar Ibrahim was very close to Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and had formed the Azad Kashmir chapter of the Pakistan Peoples Party. In 1977, General Zia ul- Haq dissolved Bhutto's government, and offered to allow Khan to continue as president as long as he stopped supporting Bhutto. Khan refused to betray Bhutto, resulting in his termination as president through a proclamation issued by General Zia ul-Haq, the Chairman of Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council, on 30 October 1978. Khan, however, was re-elected again as the President of Azad Kashmir in August 1996. He remained in office until August 2001 and was the Azad Kashmir president four times in his lifetime. Death and legacy Sardar Muhammad Ibrahim Khan died at his Islamabad, Pakistan home on 31 July 2003 after a long illness at age 88. President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Zafarullah Khan Jamali paid tributes to him in their condolence messages.

Walton's work has been used to better prepare legal arguments and to help develop artificial intelligence. A special issue of the journal Informal Logic surveyed Walton's contributions to informal logic and argumentation theory up to 2006.Informal Logic, 27(1), 2007.A festschrift honoring his contributions, Dialectics, Dialogue and Argumentation: An Examination of Douglas Walton's Theories of Reasoning and Argument, ed. C. Reed and C. W. Tindale, London: College Publications, 2010, shows how his theories are increasingly finding applications in computer science. Education Walton earned his PhD from the University of Toronto in 1972. Work Walton's work represents a distinctive approach built around a set of practical methods to help a user identify, analyze, and evaluate arguments in specialized areas such as law and science, as well as arguments of the kind used in everyday conversational discourse. Walton has called this approach logical argumentation, and as a method it has twelve defining characteristics, shown below in a simplified list. # The method analyzes and evaluates argumentation concerning a contestable claim, one where there is evidence for the claim as well as against it. The claim is tested evidentially by the pro and con arguments that support or attack it. # The procedure for examining and criticizing the arguments on both sides forms a dialogue structure in which two sides, the claimant and its opponent, take turns putting forward speech acts (for example, asking questions and putting forward arguments). # The dialogue has rules for incurring and retracting commitments that are activated by speech acts. For example, when a participant makes an assertion (claim), he or she becomes committed to the proposition contained in the assertion. # The method uses the notion of commitment (acceptance) as the fundamental tool for the analysis and evaluation of argumentation rather than the notion of belief. The reason is that belief is held to be a psychological notion internal to an agent that can only be determined indirectly, by inference to the best explanation of the agent's speech and actions. # The method assumes a database of commonly accepted knowledge that, along with other commitments, provides premises for arguments. The knowledge base is set in place at the opening stage, but can be revised as new relevant information comes in. # The method comprises the study of explanations as well as arguments, including the form of argument called inference to the best explanation or abductive reasoning. # The dialogue system is dynamic, meaning that it continually updates its database as new information comes in that is relevant to an argument being considered. # The arguments advanced are (for the most part) defeasible, meaning that they are subject to defeat as new relevant evidence comes in that refutes the argument. # Conclusions are accepted on a presumptive basis, meaning that in the absence of evidence sufficient to defeat it, a claim that is the conclusion of an argument can be tentatively accepted, even though it may be subject to later defeat. # The dialogue uses critical questioning as a way of testing plausible explanations and finding weak points in an argument that raise doubt concerning the acceptability of the argument. # The method uses standards of proof. Criteria for acceptance are held to depend on standards that require the removal of specifiable degrees of reasonable doubt. # The method is based on argumentation schemes, such as argument from expert opinion, that represent commonly used types of arguments that are defeasible. In the method, schemes work as heuristic devices that only offer presumptive support of a claim that may have to be withdrawn as new evidence comes in. The schemes connect arguments together into sequences, often called chaining, by taking the conclusion of one argument as a premise in a subsequent argument. Some common schemes are argument from goal-based reasoning, argument from negative consequences, argument from positive consequences, inference to the best explanation (abductive reasoning), argument from sign, argument from analogy, argument from precedent, argument from an established rule, argument from evidence to a hypothesis, argument from cause to effect, argument from correlation to cause, argument from sunk costs, argument from threat, argument from perception, argument from witness testimony, argument from expert opinion, argument from ignorance, argument from commitment, direct ad hominem argument, argument from inconsistency of commitments, slippery slope argument.

A charter dating between 1107√ó1113 and 1124 claims that Thor the Long founded Ednam, previously a deserted waste granted to him by King Edgar of Scotland.Howlett, Caledonian Craftsmen, pp. 10‚Äì11; Lawrie (ed.), Early Scottish Charters, no. 24 Ednam lies close to the Northumberland border with Roxburghshire. The charter states that he repopulated the settlement with his own followers and built a church. The charter grants the church to the monks of St Cuthbert. There survives the notice of this grant given by Thor to his lord Earl David (future David I of Scotland), as well as Earl David's confirmation of the same grant.See Howlett, Caledonian Craftsmen, pp. 10‚Äì14 for text, translation and commentary; Lawrie (ed.), Early Scottish Charters, nos. 24, 33, 34 Thor had a brother named Leofwine, mentioned in Thor's charter as requiring \\"redemption\\".Howlett, Caledonian Craftsmen, pp. 10‚Äì11; Lawrie (ed.), Early Scottish Charters, p. 259, suggests he had been a prisoner in the Crusades Leofwine \\"the monk\\" was commemorated in the Martyrology of the Durham Cantor's book for June 2 (day of death), and in the same source Thor Longus was commemorated for May 14.Barrow, \\"Scots in the Durham Liber Vitae\\", p. 111 The year of his death and descendants are not known, but Ednam appears to have been transferred into the Crown's hands by 1136,Lawrie (ed.), Early Scottish Charters, pp. 259‚Äì60, and no. 86 so he can be presumed dead by that date. Several Scottish families/clans claim either lineage or name-sake of Thor Longus (Longus is Latin for 'Long/Laing/Lang meaning 'Tall' in Anglish/German/Scots/etc): * Crawford * Nisbet * Swinton * Laing/Lang Thor Longus is likely the progenitor/name-sake of the Laing/Lang family of the Borders Counties of Berwickshire, Roxburgshire, and Dumfriesshire, where numerous Laing/Lange (Latin: Long(us)) meaning \\"tall or long\\" in Scots resided since at least the 1100's according to written Burgess roles of Dumfries and Berwick as well as the infamous Ragman Roll of 1296AD (Edward I) and Berwick Roll of 1333AD (Edward III). The Laings are believed to be descendants of Roman auxiliary troops stationed in Northern Britain near Hadrians Wall (Carlisle to Newcastle) (based on modern Y DNA research) along with other modern Border families from Numidia/Mauretania in N Africa or Hispania where Numidians/Mauretanians settled in early Roman Republic/Empire in the 200BC to 60AD period of Roman history (& Raetian and Belgic Gallo-Germans too). As recorded in the book published in 1860 by Edmonston and Douglas Publishers of Edinburgh named \\"Concerning Some Scotch Surnames\\" (reprinted as \\"The Old Scots Surnames: Secrets and Origins of Your Name\\" by John Menzies Publishers), the authors state on page 16: \\"A Northman who was the first colonizer of Ednam in the Merse, was named Thor.

It is in the Qianshan Mountains (), named after itself, that extends from the Changbai Mountains in the China- North Korea border, first westward to Liaoyang, then southward to Dalian in the southern corner of Liaoning Province. Name origin The park is referred to as 'The Northeast Pearl'. The name Qianshan literally means 'Thousand mountains'. This is actually an abbreviation of the full name, Thousand Lotus Flower Mountains (). According to legend, a long time ago the four corners of the sky collapsed. The Goddess N√ºwa wanted to save the people living below so she patched up the sky with stones. One stone was accidentally dropped to the ground where is splashed, throwing the earth into thousands of peaks in the shape of a lotus blossom. Thus N√ºwa created Qianshan. The park area of 44 square kilometres, is filled with both Buddhist and Taoist temples, monasteries and nunneries. Here is one of few locations where both religions are found sharing the same site. Among the peaks, a naturally wrought statue of the Buddha stands 70 meters high. It is claimed to be largest naturally occurring image of Maitreya Buddha in the world. The area has a long history of religious worship dating back to the Tang dynasty of China. The site was enhanced during both Ming and Qing dynasties. The revolutions of the twentieth century saw the site abandoned and some buildings damaged. The park has since be restored and expanded with new Pagoda and temples for the Maitreya Buddha. At its highest point, Qianshan reaches an elevation of 708.3 metres. The park is densely wooded with 95% of the area covered by forests. Over ten thousand of the pine trees have been estimated to be older than 100 years in age. Rare flora and fauna are found here along with a large number of plants used in traditional Chinese medicines. Over a hundred different species of birds can be observed in the park including the rare black-headed stork. Motor cars are not allowed within the park. Tourists must either walk or hire one of the electric carts. Many paved footpaths climb steeply up the hillsides through thick forest. These footpaths lead past stelae honouring the dead, small shrines, pagodas and temples. Three cable car routes connect to several of the park's scenic peaks. However, none of the cable cars go the whole way up, leaving visitors some climbing if they wish to attain the summit. Among Qianshan's scenic spots is a new discovery ‚Äì a mountain which has been shaped by nature in such a way that it resembles the Maitreya Buddha. The Buddha stands 70 metres high and 46 metres wide and is claimed to be the largest naturally occurring image of Maitreya Buddha in the world. Several temples have been built on the peaks overlooking the Maitreya Buddha. These include: The Pagoda of Maitreya, Great Buddha Temple, Pavilion of Buddha, Greeting Gate, Holographic Buddhist Character and Tachibana Hoxdox. The park has become the venue for the Qianshan Great Buddha Festival in June every year.

One day, they disobey and find a book open in it. It says that the oldest shall marry a prince from the east, the second a prince from the west, and the youngest a pig from the north. The youngest is horror-struck, but her sisters manage to convince her that it is impossible. The king returns and discovers, from the youngest's unhappiness, what they had done. He resolves to face it as best they can. A prince from the east marries the oldest, and a prince from the west the second, and the youngest becomes distressed. A pig comes to woo her, and when the king would have refused his consent, the city fills with pigs. The king tells his daughter that he is certain there is something strange about this pig, and that he believes magic has been at work. If she were to marry the pig, it might be broken. She marries the pig and goes off with him. At his home, he becomes a man every night, and is so kind that he wins her heart. She asks a witch what happened to her husband. The witch tells her to tie a thread to his foot to free him. When the young wife does so, her husband wakes and tells her that the spell would have fallen from him in three days, but now he must remain in this shape, and she will not find him without wearing out three pairs of iron shoes and blunting a steel staff. She sets out as soon as she gets herself three pairs of iron shoes and a steel staff. She wanders far, until she comes to the house of the Moon. The Moon's mother lets her in, and while she is there, she gives birth to a son. The Moon's mother tells her that the Moon could not tell her where to find her husband, but she can go on, to the Sun. She also gives her a chicken and tells her to keep every one of the bones. The princess thanks her, throws away one pair of shoes, which was worn out, and puts on another. She finally wends her way to the Sun's house, and the Sun's mother lets her in. She hides her, because the Sun is always ill-tempered when he returns. He is, but his mother soothes him, and asked about her husband. He cannot tell her, so his mother sends her on, to the Wind. Also, she gives her a chicken and tells her to keep care of the bones. Here, she throws out the second pair of shoes. At the Wind's house, his mother discovers that her husband lives in a wood no axe could cut through. She sends her to it, with a chicken and instructions to keep every bone. The princess goes on, although her third pair of shoes wears through, on the Milky Way. She finds the castle where her husband lives, and the bones stick together to form her a ladder to let her in. She is one bone short, and cuts off her little finger to complete the ladder. Her husband returns, and the spell on him is broken. He reveals that he is a prince, who had killed a dragon, and the dragon's mother, a witch, had turned him to that shape and then advised her to tie the string to keep him in it. They set out to his father's kingdom, and then return to her father's kingdom. Opera An opera partly based on the tale, The Enchanted Pig, by the composer Jonathan Dove, was premiered in 2006.

He probably lived in Loudon Castle even while he administrated quite some distance away in the town of Ayr. But Norse control over traditional Scots in the Western Isles and the underhanded way in which they gained control had been an aggravation to the Scots for years. Alexander III of Scotland began pressing diplomatically and militarily to regain control beginning in 1260. This prompted Haakon IV of Norway to lead a large fleet in 1263 to the maritime boundary between the jurisdictions located along the northwest shore of Ayrshire. Hugh, as the regional representative of the King and intimately familiar with the climate, offered a plan to Alexander to delay the Norse fleet in Scotland until the Autumn weather turned nasty. And it did on September 30, crushing the Norse fleet against the shoreline rocks. The Scots then attacked the confused Norse on the shore at Largs. The Norse escaped back to Norway in tatters, never to claim the Western Isles again. Alexander awarded Hugh the estate at Crosbie, shown to the right, in appreciation for his contribution to the defeat of the Norse.

In some cases, the term may refer to the situation where two unions claim the right to organize the same workers. Dual unionism is sometimes considered to be destructive of the solidarity essential to the orderly functioning of labor unions and the exercise of their power vis-a-vis the employer. Many countries outlaw dual unionism in their national, state or local labor relations acts. Many unions also outlaw dual unionism as part of their constitutions. However, some labor unions and political organizations advocate dual unionism as a means of survival or as a strategy for winning political power. The Industrial Workers of the World, for example, advocates dual unionism (although the behavior is called 'dual cardism').Jakopovich, Dan. Revolutionary Unionism: Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow. New Politics, Vol.XI, No.3 Such organizations and/or unions argue that dual unionism may be compatible with the goals of the union and therefore not a hindrance to the union. Labor parties which incorporate unions into their structures and social movement unionism, it is argued, are examples where political organizations coexist constructively with unions. The distinction between dual unionism and mere internal politics is often not clear. Many unions have political factions or caucuses which disagree on the policies, finances, values and goals of the union. But internal politics rarely rise to the level of dual unionism. In certain cases, where the situation is unclear, whether an action actually constitutes dual unionism must be resolved politically (e.g., by the exercise of power) within the union.  Examples  In the United States, communists, socialists and other political organizations have been accused of engaging in dual unionism. The controversy over the Communist Party USA-sponsored Trade Union Educational League's role within the American Federation of Labor (AFL) is an example of whether dual unionism occurred.Foner, Philip. History of the Labor Movement in the United States: The T.U.E.L, 1925‚Äì1929. New York: International Publishers, 1994. Although rarely stated as such, the ejection by the American Federation of Teachers of several locals in the 1930s for communist domination and factionalism is another example of a struggle over dual unionism.Braun, Robert J. Teachers and Power: The Story of the American Federation of Teachers. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1972. SBN 671211676. p. 48-57. Another example of dual unionism is the suspension by the AFL in August 1936 of the unions which formed the Committee for Industrial Organization (CIO). AFL president William Green accused the CIO unions of engaging in dual unionism. The charge was never adequately outlined, and the CIO denied the accusation. The AFL resorted to patently illegal means to eject the unions of the CIO (an example of the way in which political power often is the deciding factor in whether an act constitutes dual unionism).Phelan, Craig.

It is located east-southeast of Hebo, Oregon, located at the top of Mount Hebo. It was closed in 1980.Searching The Skies - The Legacy of the United States Cold War Defense Radar Program ‚Äî USAF Air Combat Command, June 1997. Contact: HQ ACC CEVP, 129 Andrews St. Suite 102, Langley AFB, Virginia. Facilities The station was 10 miles (16 km) from the Pacific Ocean and some east of the coastal community of Hebo. Due to local orographic lift of the predominant westerly Pacific airflow, Mount Hebo is often rainy, windy, cold, and snowy. Three giant Air Force radomes, about in diameter and high, were destroyed by the elements: the first was constructed in 1962 and was destroyed by high winds on 12 Oct 1962 while yet incomplete; the second was built in 1963 and was destroyed by lightning and high winds in Jan 1964; the third was a different design and constructed in 1965, but it eventually succumbed to the winds in 1968. The top of Mount Hebo is usually under a few feet of snow during the winter. Mount Hebo Air Force Station was a vital part of the Air Force Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) computer supported system for air defense. Available electronic equipment was able to support the detection, identification and destruction of enemy aircraft. This was accomplished by communications between the SAGE computers at Adair Air Force Station in Oregon and McChord Air Force Base in Washington, the radar and communications systems at Mount Hebo, and interceptor aircraft such as the supersonic F-106 Delta Dart. Primary radar systems at Mt Hebo AFS included the FPS-24 search radar, and the FPS-26A and FPS-90 height finder radars. The FPS-26A was modified between 1967 and 1970 into the FSS-7 Sea launched ballistic Missile (SLBM) sensor and tracking radar. When the third FPS-24 radome was destroyed in 1968, the FPS-24 was replaced by an FPS-27 search radar with a smaller radar antenna and radome. Connectivity to the SAGE system was through the FST-2B. Ground to air radio communications were provided in two ways. First was digital data sent to the aircraft (F-106) via the GKA-5 digital data link system's modified GRT-3 UHF radio. Second was voice communications using the sites analog single channel GRT-3 transmitters, GRR-7 receivers and GRC-27 multi-channel (transmit and receive capable) UHF radios. All radio equipment was located at the Ground-to-Air Transmitter Receiver (GATR) site. The largest building on the radar site was the , FPS-24 radar tower. Surrounding this tower was a Radome Support Structure with a , radome to protect the 85.5-ton FPS-24 antenna from snow, ice, and high winds. In addition to the main facility, Mount Hebo operated several AN/FPS-14 Gap Filler sites: * Washougal, WA (M-100A) * Philomath, OR (M-100B) Supporting infrastructure at the Mt Hebo AFS included 27 family homes in a housing area about 2.5 miles below the main site. A Ground-to-Air Radio site was about 3 miles to the east on Little Hebo. A paved access road led from the town of Hebo and climbed over 3000 feet in 8.5 miles with many curves and steep sections. Separate water systems were provided for the main site and the housing area. Separate sewer systems supported the main site, housing area, and GATR site. A power station with four 1000Kw diesel driven generators was available. Storage tanks were available for water at the main site and housing area. Diesel fuel storage tanks were available on the main site. Special purpose vehicles were assigned to support Mt Hebo AFS. Two 4-wheel drive 40 passenger buses were used primarily for taking children to and from schools in Hebo and Cloverdale. An ambulance was available for emergencies. For winter weather conditions there was an arctic snow weasel with tracks, a towable 100 gallon water tank, a snow blower, 2 snow plows, a front end loader, and a road grader. Personnel Mount Hebo was the home of the 689th Radar Squadron. Squadron responsibilities included operation and maintenance of the installed radar and communications equipment, and various support activities including food service, supply, power production, civil engineering, administration, transportation and personnel services. Available facilities included buildings for the radar and communications, barracks for personnel, family housing, a power plant, dining hall, gym, motor pool, and support activities. The radar station was like a small town. The 689th Radar Squadron was originally assigned to the SAGE Portland Air Defense Sector. Later it was realigned with the 25th Air Division SAGE at McChord AFB. Higher headquarters included the Fourth Air Force and Air Defense Command. Later, Detachment 2 of the 14th Missile Warning Squadron was activated at Mount Hebo to operate missile-warning radar. Deactivation Between 1954 and 1972, of land were acquired by the Air Force from private parties, the United States Forest Service (USFS), and the General Services Administration (GSA) for use as the Mount Hebo aircraft warning and control radar station. Between 1972 and 1987, the Air Force declared the property excess and the land was transferred to the GSA for disposal. The land is currently under the jurisdiction of the USFS (Siuslaw National Forest, Hebo Ranger District), U.S. Department of Energy, and private parties. Before its final disposal, the GSA contracted to demolish the Air Force buildings.U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Site Survey Summary Sheet for DERP-FUDS Site No. F100R052200 Mt.

The kingly palace, along with the attached fruit orchards, is a major attraction of the town.Princely States of India Major Attractions Dharamjaigarh is a beautiful town with laid-back environs, surrounded with forests on all sides. A walk in any direction out of the city leads to dense, deciduous forests, dotted with small tribal villages. In the monsoon, there is a blanket of greenery all over. The town itself is divided into two parts - one located atop a small plateau, and the other known as Nichepara, below it. The two parts are divided by a steep slope, locally known as Ghatia. Some important places of tourist attraction are: #Ambitikara: Also known as Amli or Imlitikara, it has a famous temple of Goddess Kali beside a shallow river. #Sisringa: It is a prominent valley, overlooking the town, with winding roads and a small temple at its highest point. #Amadarha: It is a beautiful picnic spot on the banks of the Mand river with numerous low waterfalls and forests on hill-slopes. #Gayatri Mandir: It is one of the famous temples in the town. #Dashera Festival: A three-day carnival in the club-grounds, it is one of the most eagerly awaited events in the town. #Hanuman Mandir Nichepara: Another famous temple in the lower section of the town. #Udyan Vibhag Narsury: It is like a town garden here many types of plants are present.

Farmers grow mainly paddy. However, they don't have easy access to market for their produce and, therefore, do not get right price for their crops. There are some rice mills, but they are too small to utilize all the produce. An IT company is assessing potential to set up its base here, which may open in two-three years. Dharamjaigarh is probably one of the most under-developed regions of Chhattisgarh. One of the major reasons for this is difficulty of access. As mentioned earlier, the town is not on the railway network because of the uneven topography of the place, and the nearest railhead is about 77 km away. Most people have to move out of the place for education as well as jobs.

Dharangaon is also the tehsil headquarters in Jalgaon district. The majority of the population is from the Marathas (Patil), Mali (Phul), Rajput (Purbhe), Dhangar, Badgujar and Teli communities. Dharangaon is the birthplace of the Marathi poet Balkavi . History Dharangaon was formerly known as Mina Nagar.citation needed At the time of the Moghal conquest in the 10th century, Dharangaon was famous for its jirifaf and bhiran clothing.Gladwin's Ain-i-Akbari, II. 52 During the seventeenth century, under the reign of Dongong, Dorongon, and Drongom, it was mentioned by multiple sources as a trade center of considerable importance. In 1674, English settlers established a factory in the town. The following March, the town was plundered by King Chhatrapati Shivaji.Bruce's Annals, IL 36,37 Four years later in 1679, King Shivaji joined forces with the Raja of Berar and again plundered Dharangaon, which at that time was one of the most flourishing places in the country.Orme's Historical Fragments, 84 In 1683 the Drongom investment was 10,000 pieces broad bastas, 10,000 pieces sevgazis, and 100,000 lbs. (2500 mans) of turmeric. In 1685 King Sambhaji plundered the town, burning or pillaging every house.Orme's Historical Fragments, 143 The factors at Dharangaon had but two hours to escape. Under the Marathas, Dharangaon suffered much from Bhil raids and was the scene of one of the Bhil massacres by which the Marathas vainly attempted to keep order. It came into British possession in 1800, and from 1825 to 1830, Lieutenant, afterward Sir James, Outram busied himself in raising the Bhil Corps.J. Pollen, C.S. In 1844 two American planters, Mr. Blount of Gorakhpur and Mr. Simpson of Madras, who had been appointed superintendents of cotton experiments, set up saw-gins. In 1845 a screw press was built, but because of its costliness proved to be a failure. In 1850 gins, nineteen in number, were hired to Ritchie Stewart Add and Co. of Bombay, who had established an agency, and a further supply of twenty-one was made for them. In 1854 the office of superintendent was abolished, and only a small establishment was kept to take charge of the gins. Out of these nineteen had been sold, a few hired out, and fifty-nine remained ready for 'disposal without any applicants. In 1855 Government established a factory with ninety- three saw gins under the management of a European overseer; merchants and cultivators were charged ¬£1 (Rs. 10) a month for the hire of a gin. But the experim ent proved costly, and after a time was given up. In 1865 120 gins were available, and an establishment kept at a yearly cost of ¬£144 (Rs. 1440), an outlay not nearly covered by the income realized from the gins.Bom. Gov. Set., New Series, XCIII. 309 Dharangaon, a municipal town in Jalgaon District, 57 km North-east of Dhulia, contained, in 1872, 11,807 inhabitants, and in 1879 had a municipal income of ¬£438 (Rs. 4380). In the 18th century, various Rajput communities came to Dharangaon, primarily from Bayas and Chauhan.

These communities came from \\"Chandavad Fort\\" as they were in service of that fort. Demographics India census, Dharangaon had a population of more than 60,000.

In 1550, he went to France and entered the service of King Henry II as one of the Gens d‚ÄôArmes, under the command of the Earl of Arran.

Glasgow University history Accessed on 12 Nov 2011 Stuart McLean, Local History of Jordanhill Accessed 14 Nov 2011 To secure this position, Crawford became a retainer of the 4th Earl of Lennox, grandfather of the future James VI. Ultimately, he became the Earl's deputy, second only to the Earl's Chamberlain, John Cunningham of Drumquhassle. He notability increased in 1569 following the murder of Queen Mary's husband, Lord Darnley, by suspected agents of the Queen. William Maitland of Lethington (and Sir James Balfour) were publicly accused of Darnley's murder by Crawford; Balfour escaped, but Lethington was imprisoned and was released by William Kirkcaldy of Grange, commander in Edinburgh Castle, which subsequently became the fortress of Mary's cause during the Lang Siege in the ensuing civil war. Assault on Dumbarton Castle Dumbarton Castle seen from across the River Clyde Crawford planned the assault and led a force of 150 men in the early hours of 2 April 1571 that scaled the cliffs and embattlements to expel the castle garrison loyal to Catholic Queen Mary from Dumbarton Castle. In this task he was assisted by John Cunningham of Drumquhassle, Matthew Douglas of Mains (both also retainers of the Earl of Lennox) and a traitor from the castle garrison called Robertson. He was once warden of the castle, knew the topography of the rock well and in particular, knew how it could be scaled. It seems that while in the service of the Governor, his wife was accused of theft and publicly flogged. This episode appears to have provoked Robertson to leave Queen's supporters in the castle and offer his services to the King's supporters, initially to Robert Douglas, who introduced him to Drumquassle. A truce between supporters of the King and supporters of the Queen expired on 1 April 1571. That evening, Crawford set out from Glasgow with Robertson and a company of men. He had sent a small advance group of horsemen ahead of him to stop all wayfarers (who might betray the mission), and he made his way to an agreed meeting place within a mile of the castle, (Dumbuck) where he was joined by Drumquhassle and Captain Hume. Here he equipped the soldiers with ropes and scaling ladders. The night was foggy and the escalade relied upon stealth, because the number of ladders that could be employed was limited. On the first attempt, the ladders slipped while the soldiers were on them; if the watch of the garrison had been more aware of the danger, the noise could have given warning of the attack and the castle might have been successfully defended. However, no alarm was raised. On the second attempt, the ladders were fixed more securely, and, their 'craws' or steel hooks being lodged firmly into the crevices of the rock. The leaders of the party then took hold of a small intermediate ledge where an ash tree was growing. They attached their ropes to the tree and pulled up the remainder of their company. However, they were still only halfway to the base of the curtain wall. They positioned their ladders again and began scaling the next stage. At this point, one of the soldiers climbing a ladder was seized with a fit. In his convulsion, he gripped the ladder so firmly and in such a way that no others could pass by him or remove him. Crawford's solution to this problem was to tie the unfortunate soldier to the ladder and turn it round (with the man suspended beneath it), so the passage was clear again. All-but-one of the party thus reached the bottom of the garrison wall, a precarious and narrow ledge. Crawford's ensign and two other soldiers scaled the wall and then came under attack by three guards until they were joined by the rest of the party. The wall (which was in poor repair) collapsed, opening a breach through which Crawford's men were able to rush in, shouting, \\"A Darnley, a Darnley!\\" (Crawford's watchword). The wall was breached on the north east side of the castle where it is highest and therefore presumed to be the least well guarded. The eastern peak of the rock (The Beak) was quickly gained, and the cannon there was captured and turned on the garrison, who attempted very little resistance, preferring to escape rather than fight back. The castle governor (Fleming) managed to escape through the postern gate which opened onto the River Clyde and reached Argyllshire. Key supporters of Queen Mary found within the castle included de Verac, the French ambassador, who was allowed to go free, but was subsequently caught aiding the Queen's supporters in Edinburgh Castle. John Hamilton, Archbishop of St Andrews was also found in the castle wearing items of armour (a mail shirt and helmet). The wife of the governor (Lady Fleming) was also detained, but was permitted to go free with her possessions. Hamilton was hanged within a matter of days at Stirling Castle. As important as the arrest of key people was the capture of documents, including some implicating Queen Mary with Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk and the Ridolfi plot. An Act of Parliament was passed on 28 August 1571 in favour of \\"Johnne Cuningham of Drumquhassel, Matho Dowglas of Manys, Captain Thomas Crawford of Jordanhill, and others takeris of the Castell of Dumbartane,\\" discharging them of any criminal or civil liabilities incurred in the recapture of the castle.The Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707 K.M.

According to one story, it was Crawford who saved the medieval building. He is reported to have said to those who were eager for its demolition, and pressing him to give permission for their action:- : \\"I am for pu'ing doon the auld kirk, but no till we ha'e first built a new ane\\" : (I am in favour of pulling down the old church, but not until we have first built a new one).Captain Crawford of Jordanhill, and his gallant capture of Dumbarton Castle, by Robert Alison Accessed on 13 Nov 2011 Crawford retired to his childhood home of Kilbirnie Place, where he died on 3 January 1603 and is entombed with his wife Janet Ker of Kerlsand at Kilbirnie Auld Kirk.

Administrator, engineer, architect and ethnographer, he is most famous for his monumental work commonly known as Monarqu√≠a indiana (\\"Indian Monarchy\\"), a survey of the history and culture of the indigenous peoples of New Spain together with an account of their conversion to Christianity, first published in Spain in 1615 and republished in 1723. Monarquia Indiana was the \\"prime text of Mexican history, and was destined to influence all subsequent chronicles until the twentieth century.\\"Brading, p. 277. It was used by later historians, the Franciscan Augustin de Vetancurt and most importantly by eighteenth-century Jesuit Francisco Javier Clavijero. No English translation of this work has ever been published. Life =Early years= There are few firm biographical details concerning Juan de Torquemada, most of which have to be deduced from his own work. Even basic information is subject to uncertainty and controversy. Born at Torquemada, Palencia, north central Spain, at an unknown date before 1566 (Miguel Le√≥n-Portilla argues in detail for 1562) he was brought by his parents to New Spain probably while still a child. He took the Franciscan habit, as is generally agreed, in 1579, and pursued a course of studies in Latin, theology, philosophy and Nahuatl. Brief notices in his own works put him at the convent in Tlacopan in 1582 and (while still a youth) at the convent in Chiauhtla - the presumption being that these relate to his novitiate.Monarqu√≠a indiana: for Tlacopan, Lib. XIV, cap. 35; for Chiauhtla, Lib. XV, cap. 38 and Lib. XX, cap. 80. The passages relating to Chiauhtla are quoted by Le√≥n-Portilla, p. 24. It is uncertain if he began his studies at the convento mayor de San Francisco in Mexico City, but it is presumed that part at least of his studies were conducted while resident at the convent of Santiago, Tlatelolco. Among his teachers he names fray Juan Bautista (who taught him theology) and Antonio Valeriano (who taught him Nahuatl and whom he especially praised for his talents).Monarqu√≠a indiana: for Juan Bautista, see Lib. XX, cap. 79; for Valeriano, see Lib. V, cap 10. Both passages quoted by Le√≥n-Portilla, p. 23. At some time in the early 1580s he was sent by his superiors to Guatemala where he encountered the conquistador Bernal D√≠az del Castillo. By 1584 he was certainly at the convent of San Francisco, where he assisted in the infirmary. The conjectured date of his priestly ordination is 1587 or 1588.For the various dates cited in this paragraph, see Le√≥n-Portilla, pp. 21, 23, 24. Moreno Toscano, p. 498, regarded 1565 as the only probable date of birth but (following Icazbalceta, although offering no arguments herself), accepts 1579 as the date Torquemada took the habit. She does not discuss the date of his ordination. For Torquemada's impression of the aged D√≠az (hombre de todo cr√©dito), see Monarqu√≠a indiana, Lib. IV, cap. 4 (quoted by Le√≥n-Portilla, p. 21). See also Alcina Franch (1973), pp.256f. who accepts a date between 1563 and 1565 for his birth or even 1559 if 1579 is taken as the date of his profession at age 20. He is almost certain to have personally known other notable Franciscan friars who were his contemporaries and who were animated, as he was, by a profound interest in the pre-hispanic life and culture of the conquered Indians in New Spain, especially Andr√©s de Olmos, Ger√≥nimo de Mendieta, and Bernardino de Sahag√∫n.Le√≥n-Portilla, p. 27; Moreno Toscano, p.499 (who mentions only Ger√≥nimo de Mendieta). =Missionary activity, 1588-1602= Map of central Mexico, the main area of Torquemada's activity Shortly after ordination (which, in this period, was normally conferred on aspirant Franciscans at age 25),Le√≥n-Portilla, p. 21. he was sent as a missionary to Nueva Galicia, a large territory in central western New Spain, the capital of which was Guadalajara and which extended north to Zacatecas and west to the Pacific. He is next heard of as guardian of the convent at Tlaxcala (east of Mexico City and north of Puebla), and although no dates can be assigned to his travels, at this time he is known to have been engaged in missionary work in the central region around Toluca (a town not far to the south-west of Mexico City) and at various places in Michoac√°n (an area west of Mexico City, extending to the Pacific). Among his achievements during this phase of his life was his role as one of the founders of the Confraternity of Nuestra Se√±ora de Soledad (Our Lady of Solitude), the indigenous members of which performed, on Sundays, edifying plays and scenes written in their own language by Torquemada for the purposes of inculcating in them and in spectators the Catholic faith.See Le√≥n-Portilla: for the location of his missionary activity, pp. 25-27; for his election as guardian of the convent at Tlaxcala, p. 22; for his part in the founding of the confraternity, pp. 27f. (quoting from Monarqu√≠a indiana, Lib. 20, cap. 79 and the Septima relaci√≥n of Chimalpahin); for his election as guardian at Tulancingo, p. 31. In 1600 and 1601 (possibly in 1599 as well) he was guardian of the convent of Zacatl√°n (in the central highlands north-east of Mexico City). In 1602 he was guardian of the convent of Tulancingo. Then, in 1603, he was elected guardian of the convent of Santiago Tlatelolco, taking up his post there on 22 July; a post he held, it seems, for eight and a half years.Le√≥n-Portilla: for the starting date, see p. 31 (quoting the Anales coloniales de Tlatelolco; for Torquemada as guardian of the convent of Tlaxcala in February 1612, see p. 39 (citing the Aprobaci√≥n of [27] February of that year provided for the Monarqu√≠a indiana by fray Luis V√°ez. =At Tlatelolco, 1603-1612= While guardian of the convent at Tlatelolco, he assumed numerous heavy burdens, both intellectual and practical, not all of which related to the affairs of the Franciscans.In the general Prologue to Monarqu√≠a indiana he emphasises how heavy these burdens were, not (he says) in order to boast of his talents but to show how much he accomplished in the comparatively few years when he was also writing (when he had the time) his magnum opus. Among those which did may be mentioned the fact that the guardian of the convent was ex officio President of the Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco, a post which entailed general oversight of the conduct of the institution under its rector. The College had, however, so far declined from the ambitious plans which attended its ceremonial opening in 1536 that, by the end of the 16th century, it had become an elementary school where local Indian children learnt reading, writing, manners and good behaviour.For the guardian as ex officio president of the institution, see Moreno Toscano, p. 499 (although she mis-assigns the start of his guardianship to 1600). For the decline of the institution before Torquemada's guardianship, see Juan Estarellas, \\"The College of Tlatelolco and the Problem of Higher Education for Indians in 16th Century Mexico\\", History of Education Quarterly, Vol. 2, No. 4 (Dec., 1962), pp. 234-243 , at pp. 240f. Administrator In 1604 he visited Zacatecas to assist in the establishment of a Franciscan province to be headquartered there, and in 1606 he spent time in Michoac√°n and Jalisco for the same purpose - the establishment of a new province in Jalisco (headquartered in Guadalajara), carved out of the province of San Pedro y San Pablo covering Michoac√°n-Jalisco.Le√≥n-Portilla, p. 34. For the division of Franciscan provinces in New Spain at this time, see Habig, p. 228, with the map on p. 216. A surge of vocations from among the criollos as well as a renewed influx of friars from Spain had necessitated a new alignment of responsibilities. A generation before (in 1570), numbers of friars in Nueva Galicia had fallen to 16, four of whom were elderly. In striking contrast to this long period of decline, in 1601 and 1602 alone, 14 friars had arrived from Spain destined for Nueva Galicia and 32 more for Zacatecas. Between 1610 and 1618 these numbers were augmented by another 40 arrivals.Foin, pp. 219-221 for the low number in 1570; p. 234, table of arrivals 1610 onwards. Engineer a contemporary painting showing Mexico City in 1628; the view east, overlooking Lake Texcoco Abnormally high rainfall in August 1604 led to a devastating flood of Mexico City - one of several inundations from Lake Texcoco which sometimes took years to recede. The city was still virtually an island at this time. Other such inundations occurred in 1555, 1580, 1607 and 1629 resulting in the decision in 1629 (imperfectly implemented) to drain part of the lake.Louisa Hoberman, pp. 212 and 222, and see Mathes, pp. 425-428. As an emergency measure, Viceroy Juan de Mendoza asked the Franciscan provincial to assign members of his Order to help in various urgent remedial works. Torquemada participated, specifically in the reconstruction of the calzadas (causeways) of Los Misterios (leading north-east to Guadalupe ‚Äì works which took five months of continuous activity to complete, employing thousands of labourers) and of that leading west to Chapultepec. When these works were finished, the friars organised the cleaning of the main drains of the city. It was only through the friars' petitioning the Viceroy that he ordered the labourers to be paid and fed at government expense.See passages in Monarqu√≠a indiana, Lib. V, cap. 60, partly quoted by Le√≥n-Portilla, pp. 33f. and Pr√≥logo general (p. XXIX of IIH edn.). The three main causeways dating from the Aztec period are described in Monarqu√≠a indiana, Lib. III, cap. 23; the Spaniards built two more (ibid., cap. 26). Architect Commencing in 1604, Torquemada took in hand the construction of a new church of Santiago de Tlatelolco, a project which had been stalled for many years. He reported that it proceeded in great part thanks to contributions in cash and kind by local Indians, many of whom donated their labour.Monarqu√≠a indiana, Lib. XVII, cap. 5, quoted by Victoria (1990) at pp. 75f. It is notable for the massive bases of the towers flanking the main entrance, designed to resist earthquake.Interior of the church of Santiago de Tlatelolco The work was completed in 1609 or 1610, and on 14 July 1610 the church was consecrated.Le√≥n-Portilla (p. 36) quotes the anonymous Anales coloniales de Tlatelolco and the Diario of Chimalpahin on the events of 14 and 15 July 1610; Victoria (1990) at p. 76 quotes the same passages, accepting 1610 as the relevant year. In his later work (1994, p. 38), he preferred the date 1609 for the completion of the building works, relying on a passage in Monarqu√≠a indiana, Lib. XVII, cap. 4. It was built in the form of a Latin cross with a series of shallow domes in the vault over the nave and a large dome over the crossing, with a semi-dome over the apse. The following day, on Sunday 15 July 1610 (the feast of Santiago) the altarpiece or retablo behind the high altar was inaugurated.Chimalpahin in his Diario is explicit that the consecration occurred on 14 July, the eve of the feast (\\"14 de julio de mil seiscientos diez a√±os, siendo las v√≠speras de Santiago ap√≥stol\\"), and that the retablo was inaugurated the following day, a Sunday, the feast of Santiago, 15 July; in the Roman Calendar that feast is celebrated on 25 July. This sumptuous structure was arranged in four registers with an apex. It was decorated with 14 paintings by the celebrated Basque painter Baltasar de Echave Orio (who is also credited with designing the retablo), alternating with carved wooden statues standing in niches. At the centre of the second register, directly above the later neo-classic ciborium (presumptively installed in the first decades of the 19th century and visible in a 19th century lithograph which shows the arrangement of the retablo), was a carved and painted panel in high relief of the patron saint of the church, Santiago Matamoros, the only part of the retablo that has survived.The retablo is described in Victoria (1990) pp. 78, based on a lithograph published in 1861 in Manuel Ram√≠rez Aparicio's book Los conventos suprimidos de M√©xico, and reproduced as fig. 1 to Victoria's article; fig. 2 is a photograph of the Santiago panel. It is Victoria (1990, p. 77 and p. 78, cf. (1994) pp. 111f.) who attributes the design of the retablo to Echave. Torquemada applauded the skill of the Indian craftsmen and singled out for praise one of those who worked on the retablo, Miguel Mauricio, calling him an artist second to none among the Spanish.Monarqu√≠a indiana, Lib. XII, cap. 34. Western fa√ßade of church of Santiago de Tlatelolco Most of the decoration of the church was either removed by the civil authorities, looted, damaged or destroyed during the turmoil of the era of La Reforma in the mid-19th century.See Victoria (1990), p. 74. The church then became a customs warehouse, and as late as 1944 the convent was a military gaol; but the use of the church has since been restored to the Franciscans and the Santiago panel has been returned to its original location on the wall above the altar.Arroyo: for the fate of the church, 1; for the fate of the retablo, 2. A curious episode attaches to the building of the church. Allegations were made that Torquemada had exploited and abused the Indian workforce and had severely beaten one particular labourer \\"almost to death\\" (a punto de muerte). An official investigation was initiated by the Archbishop of M√©xico on 16 February 1605, but there is no record of the outcome and there was no interruption to Torquemada's work on the church.See Le√≥n-Portilla, pp. 36f., who comments that gratuitous violence, especially against Indians, is not congruent with everything else we know about the character and disposition of Torquemada. Historian It was while he was guardian of the convent of Tlatelolco that Torquemada also put in hand the organisation of the materials he had been gathering for many years previously, and (between 1605 and 1612) their redaction into the great work he had been projecting - the history of the aboriginal nations of New Spain, and their conquest and evangelisation by the Spanish. In addition to the voluminous unpublished writings of other Franciscans to which he had unimpeded access, Torquemada possessed many original documents acquired during his missionary work, as well as the oral testimony he had obtained from people he had encountered on his various travels.For the dates of composition, see Le√≥n-Portilla, p. 20. In 1609 he had been named chronicler of the Franciscan Order by Fray Bernardo de Salva, Franciscan Commissary General of the Indies.Alcina Franch, p.258 citing Monarqu√≠a indiana. The letter of appointment, dated 6 April 1609 is at pp. XXI and XXII of the preliminares to the IIH online edn. On completion of the work he took the manuscript to Spain in order to oversee its publication (as to which see below). =Last years, 1613-1624= On 8 January 1614, in the year following his return from Spain, Torquemada was elected provincial of the province of the Holy Gospel (del Santo Evangelio de M√©xico) a post he held for the usual three-year term until the election of a successor on 14 January 1617.For the terminal dates of service as provincial, see Le√≥n-Portilla, pp. 42f. At that time the province of the Holy Gospel comprised M√©xico City, the modern State of M√©xico, and the State of Puebla, together with the custodia of Tampico on the Gulf Coast.Habig, p. 220, with map at p. 216. In 1908 the provinces were consolidated into three, and Santo Evangelio comprised all the southern States of Mexico: Habig, p. 223. For Puebla as comprised within the province at this time, see the review by John P. Harrison of: Francisco Morales, O.F.M., \\"Ethnic and Social Background of the Franciscan Friars in Seventeenth Century Mexico\\" (1973), in Catholic Historical Review, Vol. 63, No. 1 (January 1977), pp. 60f., at p. 60. In an ongoing dispute over the division of elective posts within the province conducted between the criollos (ethnic Spaniards born in New Spain) and the peninsulares (those born in Spain but who had emigrated to New Spain), Torquemada identified himself not as a peninsular (which he could justly claim to be) but as a member of an intermediate group of men who came out to New Spain in their childhood and regarded themselves as hijos de la provincia (sons of the province). The dispute became especially bitter under Torquemada's successor as provincial Juan L√≥pez, a peninsular, with respect to whom Torquemada expressed deep- seated hostility, accusing him in private correspondence (two letters written in October 1620 to a former confr√®re of his, then resident in Spain) of being a liar and an hombre sin Dios (a man without God), and asserting that Hell held no man worse or more false (este mal hombre de fray Juan L√≥pez . . digo que otro peor no lo tiene el infierno ni m√°s falso).Le√≥n-Portilla, pp. 43-46, quoting the relevant parts of the letters and (p. 46) remarking upon the harshness and violence of Torquemada's language when denouncing lies and injustice. At the age of 62 or thereabouts, Torquemada died suddenly on New Year's Day, 1624, in choir in the convent at Tlatelolco after having sung matins with the community at midnight. He had apparently been in good health. The cause of death was likely a heart attack, given that an indigenous witness said he said \\"Help me, unloose my chest where my heart is.\\"Alcina Franch, p.259 quoting \\"Unos anales colonialies, 1948, pp. 182-84. He died in the presence of his brother friars and of the guardian of the convent of San Francisco. His body was conducted in solemn procession from Tlatelolco to Mexico City accompanied by many mourners who paused at seven places on the way in order to sing responses. On arrival at the church of San Francisco (the mother church of the province), it was interred in the sanctuary, on the right-hand side near the high altar.Details taken from the Anales coloniales de Tlatelolco, quoted by Le√≥n-Portilla (pp. 47f.). Moreno Toscano (p. 501) asserts that he died at the convent of San Francisco. Alcina Franch (p. 60, but hesitantly - al parecer, he notes) understood that at the time of death Torquemada himself was guardian of the convent of San Francisco. Literary works =Monarqu√≠a indiana= Introduction By way of providing impetus to and official sanction for Torquemada's history, fray Bernardo Salva, the Comisario general de Indias (acting by specific direction from his immediate superior, Arc√°ngelo de Messina, the minister general of the Order) wrote a letter dated 6 April 1609 from Madrid, in which he gave written authority and instructions to Torquemada to compile a chronicle of the life and work of the members of the Franciscan Order active in New Spain, as well as a wide-ranging account of the history and culture of the peoples they had evangelised. For that purpose, as Salva wrote, Torquemada was to utilise the voluminous historical and ethnographic writings of his fellow Franciscans (now, all of them dead) to which he had access, almost nothing of which had by then been published: works by Andr√©s de Olmos, Ger√≥nimo de Mendieta, Motolin√≠a, and Bernardino de Sahag√∫n. Of these, only de Mendieta was mentioned by name by Salva. The work is a \\"remarkably dense text,\\" because of its theological digressions, contradictions, and anachronisms, since Torquemada incorporated material without resolving contradictory and competing points of view from his sources.Brading, pp.281-83. In addition to the texts written by Spaniards, Torquemada draws on the work of mestizo Tlaxcala patriot Diego Mu√±oz Camargo, and Texcoco indigenous nobility Fernando Alva Ixtlilxochitl, Juan Bautista Pomar, and Antonio de Pimentel, and the account of the conquest from the Tlatelolco point of view compiled by Bernardino de Sahag√∫n. He incorporates a large quantity of information taken from indigenous pictographs and manuscripts.Brading, p.281. Torquemada interviewed elderly indigenous people about their ancestors and recorded their oral traditions. The Monarqu√≠a indiana is the best work on what was known of the indigenous past at the beginning of the seventeenth century. It is considered an especially important source on the Mexica, Totonac, Pipil and Nicoya cultures. At the time of its publication, Torquemada referred to his history under the abbreviated title Libros rituales y monarqu√≠a indiana or Monarqu√≠a y historia indiana, but others were already calling it the Monarqu√≠a indiana, the name by which it has generally been known ever since.In the preliminares to the IIH online edn see: Torquemada's pr√≥logo general (pp. XXIX and XXXI); for the 2nd edn, the printer's proemio and the requisite government tax certificate (pp. IX and XXXVII respectively). Antonio de Herrera, chronicler royal, had an advance copy of the work which he attacked under the name Monarqu√≠a indiana at the end of his own Historia general de los hechos de los Castellanos en las islas y tierra firme del mar oc√©ano published in parts between 1601 and 1615; see Gurr√≠a Lacroix, pp. 431f. Vision of history and purpose of the work The leading motif of Torquemada's monumental history ‚Äì elaborated by him in many places, especially in the general prologue to the entire work ‚Äì can be characterised as the merciful action of Divine Providence in choosing the Spanish to liberate the Indians from their subjection to the Devil who had deceived these innocent peoples into practising a religion marred by errors and polluted by abominations such as human sacrifice.Moreno Toscano, pp. 501-503; Le√≥n-Portilla, pp. 351-361, 364; Rubial Garc√≠a, p. 351. On this interpretation the fall of the Aztec monarchy was a Divine chastisement and Spain the rod.See, e.g., Phelan, pp. 114f. But, for all that, Torquemada was sympathetic to the positive achievements of the Indians, and, by situating their history and culture within the framework of the Old Testament and of the former glories of the empires of Egypt, Greece and Rome, he encouraged the educated elite of the Old World to recognise the indigenous nations of the New World as their peers.Phelan, pp. 115-117; Moreno Toscano, pp. 506-508; Le√≥n- Portilla, pp. 349f., 364; Cline, p. 372; Rubial Garc√≠a, p. 351. His history was, of set purpose, a laborious inquiry into the truth of things, requiring (as he says in his general prologue) diligence, maturation, and the exercise of prudence in adjudicating among conflicting testimonies.. . fuera de otras mil cosas, una diligencia grande en la inquisici√≥n de las cosas verdaderas, una madureza no menor en conferir las dudosas y en computar los tiempos, una prudencia particular y se√±alada en tratar las unas y las otras, y sobre todo, en la era en que estamos, es menester un √°nimo santo y desembarazado para pretender agradar s√≥lo a Dios, sin aguardar de los hombres el premio o alg√∫n inter√©s. It was not written as an entertainment or to satisfy mere curiosity, but with a serious didactic purpose and to edify, for he believed that the record of the events of the past constitute not only an antidote to human mortality and the brevity of life, but also a hermeneutic key to understanding the present, thereby offering man an opportunity to progress.Moreno Tuscano, p. 502; Le√≥n-Portilla, pp. 342-344; Rubial Garc√≠a, p. 347. Method The distinguished scholar and administrator, Howard F. Cline, who, at the time of his death was Director of the Hispanic Foundation of the Library of Congress in Washington D.C.See the obituary by John J. Finan in The Hispanic American Historical Review, Vol. 51, No. 4 (November, 1971), pp. 646-653, at p. 646. gave, in 1969, this positive assessment of Torquemada's skill as an historian :-Cline, p. 372. > Historians generally see their tasks broken into three main stages: as > comprehensive as possible collection of relevant documentation, followed by > critical and evaluative appraisal of it, and finally, a synthesis based on > verified data. Contrary to a considerable body of hostile secondary > discussion, critical examination of Juan de Torquemada's Monarqu√≠a Indiana > indicates a surprisingly high level of workmanship in at least the first two > phases. Although what he strove for in synthesis - an accurate record that > would place native Mexican cultures on a par with ancient, classical, and > for him modern societies - is an early and interesting example of a > comparative approach, the classical and Biblical citations he employed for > such comparisons are now largely of curiosity value, except as clues to his > own ambience and personal outlook. Torquemada was a skilled and careful > historian, constrained only by some obvious usages and common attitudes of > his age. Like others of his time, he puzzled over the problems of fitting > native peopling of the New World and their development into a Biblical > framework, and seldom doubted authenticity of miracles, or the Providential > intervention which accounted for Cortes' Conquest as an expression of Divine > Will. But for the most part he went at his tasks with professional coolness, > and a rather high degree of historiographical craftsmanship. Subject-matter Salva's letter of 6 April 1609 itself expressed the full ambit of Torquemada's work as eventually written, including, as regards the converted Indians: \\"their rituals, ceremonies, laws, governments and governors, their mode of conservation and conversation, their kings, kingdoms, cities and domains, their origin and beginnings, their division into provinces and kingdoms [sic]; the diversity of their languages, their riches and means of sustenance, their gods and worship, and, with great particularity, the manner in which friars and ministers initially converted them and how they have followed up on those conversions . . .\\"Letter from fray Bernardo Salva, publ. as part of the preliminares to the IIH online edition, pp. XXI and XXII:- \\". . de las vidas de tantos religiosos santos y graves . . como tambi√©n de los nuevamente convertidos, de sus ritos y ceremonias, de sus leyes, rep√∫blicas y gobiernos; del modo de su conservaci√≥n y conversaci√≥n, de sus reyes, reinos, ciudades y se√±or√≠os, de su origen y principios, de la divisi√≥n, provincias y reinos; de la diversidad de sus lenguas, de las riquezas y sustentos de ellos, de sus dioses y adoraciones y con mucha particularidad del modo que los religiosos y ministros tuvieron en el principio de aquellas conversiones y c√≥mo han proseguido y prosiguen en ellas; con el modo de su entrada y el que tienen en la administraci√≥n de los santos sacramentos, donde tan copioso fruto se ha cogido; y con las dem√°s cosas notables que en √©sa y las dem√°s provincias de la Nueva Espa√±a se pudieren verificar y sacar en limpio, poni√©ndolo vuestra reverencia todo en buen estilo y modo historial.\\" The work was published in three hefty volumes under a title which gives a precise conspectus of its subject-matter and author: LOS VEINTE IUN LIBROS RITUALES I MONARCHIA Indiana con el origen y guerras de los Indios Ocidentales, de sus Pobla√ßones, Descubrimiento, Conquista, Conversion y otras cosas maravillosas de la mesma [sic] tierra discribuydos en tres tomos. COMPUESTO POR F. JUAN DE TORQUEMADA Ministro Provincial de la Orden de Nuestro Serafico Padre, San Francisco En la Provincia del Santo Evangelio de Mexico en la Nueva Espana.As printed on the title-page of the 2nd edition, lacking accents; word-breaks introduced, and medial \\"s\\" written in modern style. The first volume comprises five books which principally treat of the creation of the world and the origin of the peoples who occupied New Spain (I, II), as well as the diverse nations constituting the Aztec Empire (III), followed by its conquest by the Spanish (IV) and its subsequent re-organisation (V). To the second volume were assigned nine books which deal with the religion (VI-X), government (XI), laws (XII), institutions (XIII) and social and military life of the indigenous peoples together with remarks on various geographical features and their cultural relevance (XIV). The subject of the seven books which constitute the third volume is the evangelisation of the Indians, with particular focus (especially in the last three books) upon the life, work and fate of Franciscan missionaries. The main focus is on the history and culture of the peoples of what is now central Mexico, with particular attention given to Texcoco, Azcapotzalco, Tlaxcala, Tlatelolco, and Tenochtitlan as well as the Totonacs living further east, towards the Gulf of Mexico. Nevertheless, the work also includes among its subjects other peoples living in Central America (Honduras and Guatemala), in the Caribbean, and in North and South America (specifically: Florida, New Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, the Andean civilisations, and even parts of Brasil).For an overview, see Cline, pp. 377-386. Torquemada describes the 1576 epidemic in New Spain in the following terms: > In the year 1576 a great mortality and pestilence that lasted for more than > a year overcame the Indians. It was so big that it ruined and destroyed > almost the entire land. The place we know as New Spain was left almost > empty. He reported that two million, mostly indigenous, people died, according to a survey conducted by Viceroy Don Mart√≠n Enr√≠quez de Almanza.Quoted in Rodolfo Acuna-Soto, et al.,\\"Large Epidemics of Hemorrhagic Fevers in Mexico 1545-1815\\" Sources Fragment of a pictograph (known as a \\"codex\\") similar to the prehispanic historical materials utilised for the Monarqu√≠a indiana The great diversity of sources employed by Torquemada, including precious indigenous documents now lost as well as colonial texts (published and unpublished), is fully laid out in exhaustive tables of analysis for each of the books in volume 7 of the IIH critical edition, following extensive study by the research seminar conducted under the leadership of Miguel Le√≥n-Portilla between 1969 and 1971.In addition to the tables of analysis, see also Le√≥n- Portilla, p. 95. The indigenous sources are discussed at pp. 96-109; those in Spanish, at pp. 109-127. Biblical, ecclesiastical, and classical sources are discussed in the essay \\"Fuentes b√≠blicas, cl√°sicas y contemporaneas\\" by Elsa Cecilia Frost (ibid.) pp. 267-274, and listed in the three appendices to that essay. At the end of the 17th century a charge of plagiarism was raised by fray Agust√≠n de Vetancur who claimed that Torquemada had published under his own name the Historia eclesi√°stica indiana, a history written by Jer√≥nimo de Mendieta which had never been published, but the manuscript of which had been entrusted by Mendieta to Juan Bautista and by him to Torquemada. The accusation was rejected by Rodr√≠gues Franco in his Proemio to the second edition of Monarqu√≠a indiana, but it was taken up by the famous Mexican historian Joaqu√≠n Garc√≠a Icazbalceta in the 19th century after acquiring the manuscript of Mendieta's work which he published in 1870, pointing out the areas of exact correspondence between both works.The charge was levelled by Vetancur in Teatro Mexicano: Cr√≥nica de la Provincia del Santo Evangelio de M√©xico, Menologio Franciscano, Mexico (1697-98). The transfer of Mendieta's manuscript is asserted by Juan Bautista in the Pr√≥logo to his 1606 book of sermons in Nahuatl. For the Proemio to the 2nd edn see the preliminares to the IIH online edn at pp. IX-XVI; the response to Vetancur is at pp. XII-XIV. See, on all this, Gurr√≠a Lacroix, pp. 57-67. One 20th century scholar considered the charge to be:-See Phelan, chapter 13, especially at pp. 112-114. The quote comes from footnote 4. On p. 114 Phelan observes that in Book IV Torquemada borrowed from Herrera who borrowed from Cervantes de Salazar and L√≥pez de G√≥mara, both of whom \\"derived much of their material from Motolin√≠a\\". He continued: \\"It is both impertinent and superfluous to squander moral indignation about the plagiarism of these authors . .\\" > . . not completely justified in view of the fact that Torquemada was ordered > by his superiors to use all historical works available and that politically > speaking it was desirable that the Monarqu√≠a indiana should not be too > closely identified with the Historia eclesi√°stica indiana, lest the oblivion > of the latter overtake the former. The various ways in which the accusation has been made are discussed in Gurr√≠a Lacroix' essay (\\"Acusaci√≥n de plagiario\\") in volume 7 of the IIH edition. As Woodrow Borah put it in his review:-At p. 565. On this point, see also Casta√±eda de la Paz, passim, esp. p. 189 (where she discusses Chimalpahin's use of work by Tezozomoc) and pp. 193f. (where she discusses Tezozomoc's use of earlier documents). > Jorge Gurr√≠a Lacroix, who died before this volume appeared, examines at > considerable length the old charge of plagiarism raised against Fray Juan in > his use particularly of Mendieta's chronicle, and by doing so, of Mendieta > in his use of Motolini√°'s writing. The charges are disposed of, one hopes > definitively, by making clear the customs of the time and the specific > instructions to Torquemada from his Order. Chronicles were regarded as > community property to be used as the Order decided. The charge occasionally resurfaces, even if only obliquely and by association.See, e.g., Merrim, p. 213; Carman, p. 84. Almost the entirety of Mendieta's history is reproduced throughout the course of Books 15-21 of the Monarqu√≠a indiana (where it comprises about 80% of the text),Le√≥n-Portilla, p. 122. but in the general prologue Torquemada acknowledged his use of prior writings by Francisco Xim√©nez, Motolin√≠a, Sahag√∫n, and Mendieta, and 66 specific references are made to Mendieta in the course of the work (only 36 of which have been identified). Nevertheless, Torquemada indisputably used these sources far more extensively than he gave credit for.Alcina Franch, pp. 63-67, especially at pp. 64 and 66. Publication Once the work was in its final shape, Torquemada took the manuscript to Spain personally, despite the Comisario general de Indias (Bernardo Salva) having previously invited him to send it.Letter dated 6 April 1609 from Salva, publ. in the preliminares to the IIH online edn at pp. XXIf. The evidence that Torquemada took it to Spain resides in the permits issued in New Spain for his departure and Spain for his return (unfortunately, lacking dates) - see Le√≥n-Portilla, pp. 40-42. Precise dates for the trip are not known, but the termini within which the trip must have occurred can be stated with confidence. Among the documents Torquemada took to Spain with him were the various permits relative to the printing of the book which were issued in M√©xico, the latest of which (the licence proper) was dated 17 May 1612. Back in Mexico, he officiated at a wedding in Xochimilco (where he was now guardian) on 10 October 1613. In between, he can be presumptively placed in Madrid on and before 4 February 1613 and again, on and before 5 May of the same year, those being the dates when written approval for the printing was granted by two officials resident in that city, who stated they had read and approved the manuscript.Le√≥n-Portilla: permits issued in Mexico before departure (including the licence granted by the provincial dated 17 May 1612), and Torquemada's presence in Xochimilco on 10 October 1613, p. 40; recommendations issued in Madrid, p. 41 (one, acting at the request of a senior Franciscan, with oversight of all the friars in the Indies, was by fray Francisco de Arribas, confessor of King Philip III of Spain; the other, acting by order of the Royal Council of Castile, was by Pedro de Valencia, chronicler royal). The first edition was printed by Mathias Clavijo in Seville in 1615; that is, two years after Torquemada had returned to Mexico, so his presence in Seville can only have been to select and arrange matters with the printer, and not to oversee the actual printing or check the galley-proofs. Le√≥n-Portilla suggests these arrangements (including the choice of type and the layout) might have taken weeks at most, giving Torquemada time to visit Madrid and other places in the land of his birth.Le√≥n-Portilla, p. 41. That no doubt explains how it happened that the first edition lacked two passages present in the manuscript, as well as words from some of the chapter headings, and contained countless other mistakes which the printer of the second edition noted but did not specify in his Proemio. . . en el cuerpo de la historia y en las m√°rgenes, eran innumerables las faltas (in the body of the History and in the margins, the mistakes were countless). The Proemio to the 2nd edn (dated 1725 although the title page says 1723) is in the preliminares to the IIH online edn (pp. VII-XVI). Gurr√≠a Lacroix, p. 469, says the missing passages are the last paragraph of chapter 22, and the whole of chapter 66, but without identifying the book(s). Each of books 2, 4, 5, and 20 has more than 65 chapters, and only books 12, 18 and 21 have less than 22. Despite the blemishes which marred the body of the first edition, the printer of the second edition was unstinting in his praise of the analytic indices which, he said, greatly enriched the text. According to a modern commentator, expressing also the hope that similar works would not omit a scientific apparatus of this kind, \\"their usefulness and erudition are formidable\\".Gurr√≠a Lacroix, p. 469: \\"[Los √≠ndices] son en verdad, de una utilidad y erudici√≥n formidables y ojal√° que en la actualidad no se omitiera este tipo de aparato cient√≠fico, en obras similares.\\" Dedication Exceptionally, in the Carta nuncupatoria Torquemada dedicated his book to God ‚Äì a la Sacrat√≠sima Magestad del Rey del Cielo, Dios Nuestro Se√±or (to the Sacred Majesty of the King of Heaven, God Our Lord) ‚Äì explaining at length why he did so. As he well knew, the normal dedication of such works was to the King of Spain, to nobles, or to ecclesiastical dignitaries (usually the patrons of the author).Gurr√≠a Lacroix, pp. 468 and 469. A comparable dedication to the Heavenly King appears in a book of Nahuatl sermons published in Mexico in 1606 written by fray Juan Bautista, former teacher and singular amigo (special friend) of Torquemada - as he describes himself in his own pr√≥logo. The title-page of Juan Bautista's book opens with these words: \\"A Iesu Christo S[e√±or] N[uestro] ofrece este sermonario en lengua mexicana su indigno siervo Fr[ay] Ioan Baptista . . (To Jesus Christ Our Lord, his unworthy servant Juan Bautista offers this book of sermons in the Mexican language). The dedication is repeated in a verse (v.2b) from the Vulgate edition of Psalm 45 (44) printed under an engraving of Jesus (Iesu Christo Nazareno) on the title-page: Dico ego opera mea Regi (I recite my works to the King). The title page announces the same dedication: Dico Ego Opera Mea Regi. Saeculorum Inmortali et Invisibili.The first phrase is taken from verse 2b of the Vulgate edition of Psalm 45 (44) (I recite my works to the King). The second (the immortal and invisible [King] of the ages) is taken from a verse in one of the Pauline Epistles (1 Tim.1:17) : \\"regi autem saeculorum inmortali invisibili soli Deo honor et gloria in saecula saeculorum amen\\" (But to the King of the ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen). Diffusion Although (as noted in the following sub-section) the greater part of the print-run of the first edition was said to have been lost in a shipwreck, the Monarqu√≠a indiana was known in Mexico as early as 1624 when it was first cited in a book published there in that year. Between then and 1714 (that is to say, before the second edition) it was cited, even copiously on occasion, by at least eleven authors in works published for the most part in Mexico, but also in Madrid and Guatemala.Gurr√≠a Lacroix, pp. 431-435. Subsequent history of the text Title page of the second edition of Monarqu√≠a indiana, by Fray Juan de Torquemada, printed in three volumes in Madrid, 1723 (1725) The fate of the first edition, and details of the two subsequent facsimile reprints, are stated here as given in the essay \\"Ediciones\\" by Jorge Gurr√≠a Lacroix in volume 7 of the IIH critical edition.pp. 467-470. As Nicol√°s Rodr√≠guez Franco, the printer of the second edition, informed his readers in his Proemio,For the Proemio see the preliminares to the IIH online edn, at pp. IX-XVI. The relevant parts are quoted by Gurr√≠a Lacroix. few exemplars of the first edition survive because the greater part of the print-run was lost in a shipwreck, and only three copies were known to him.One in the Royal Library, one in the Colegio Imperial of the Jesuits, and one in a private collection. Eight copies of the first edition exist in various libraries in North America and Europe, two of which lack the original frontispiece, and the other six of which lack also the first 32 pages. A ninth copy exists in Mexico divided between one owner who possesses the first volume, and another who possesses the other two. The errors and omissions were made good in the second edition by reference to the original manuscript which, so Franco discloses, was in the library of Don Andr√©s Gonz√°lez de Barcia. The second edition has the date 1723 on the title page, but the Proemio itself is dated 20 January 1725, so the effective publication date must have been later than that.See remarks in footnote 1 on the first page of the general introduction by Le√≥n-Portilla to the critical edition published by IIH (vol. 7, pp.7-11). A third edition (a new facsimile reprint rather than a new edition) was printed in Mexico in 1943 by Salvador Ch√°vez Hayhoe. The only addition was a title-page identifying the data relevant to the reprint. The fourth edition, published by Editorial Porr√∫a in Mexico in 1969 with an Introduction by Miguel Le√≥n-Portilla, was another facsimile reprint of the second edition, but, this time, employing a magnificent large paper exemplar formerly owned by the Mexican historian Joaqu√≠n Garc√≠a Icazbalceta. The fifth edition (substantively, the third, critical edition) was published by the Instituto de Investigaciones Hist√≥ricas (IIH), a research institute of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), in seven volumes between 1975 and 1983. A research team was assembled under the direction of Miguel Le√≥n-Portilla with the task of establishing the text (without, however, the benefit of the original manuscript, which could not be located) and of publishing it in six volumes, with (among other materials) analytic indices tracking Torquemada's sources. The decision was taken to modernise the orthography and punctuation in order to facilitate reading. Members of the team wrote various scholarly studies relevant to Torquemada and the Monarqu√≠a indiana, which were published in 1983 as volume 7 to the series. Since 2010, this edition had been available online.See Le√≥n- Portilla: Advertencia to the completed work, pp. V and VI of the preliminares to the online edn; general introduction to volume 7 (pp. 7-11); and the Presentaci√≥n dated May, 2010 on the home page of the project on the IIH website accessed, 15 January 2014. The completed work was warmly applauded by, e.g., Woodrow Borah in his review in The Hispanic American Historical Review, Vol. 65, No. 3 (Aug., 1985), pp. 564-565 (\\"The great project has borne rich yield. We should wish for more seminars of this kind\\"), but not without reservations as to the decision to modernise the text). Critical appraisal of the work Until the publication of Mendieta's Historia eclesi√°stica indiana in 1870, Torquemada's work was held in high esteem but, thereafter, Icazbalceta's prestige combined with his vigorous denunciation of Torquemada's supposed plagiarism of his predecessor's previously unknown History, caused the Monarqu√≠a indiana to fall into disrepute, and many commentators disparaged its method, content, and style. From the middle of the 20th century, the work of numerous scholars has gone far to rehabilitating Torquemada and re- assessing the significance of the Monarqu√≠a indiana. According to John Leddy Phelan, writing in 1956 (second edition revised, 1970):-See Phelan, p. 117. > For the historian of ideas the Monarqu√≠a indiana deserves to be restored to > a position of eminence as one of the classic sources of colonial > historiography. In the opinion of Alcina Franch (1969):-See Alcina Franch, Spanish text republished in 1988, p. 70. > \\"Neither the ponderous and erudite digressions . . nor the supposed > plagiarism . . can obscure the genuine value of Torquemada's work; that is, > his extraordinary assemblage of materials available at the end of the 16th > century for tracing the ancient and contemporary history of Mexico, > unwittingly salvaging numerous old sources, reports, oral traditions, etc., > which, without him, would have been forever lost beyond recall.\\" > (translation from the Spanish original) More recently, it has been said (1996):-Villalba, p.39. > La importancia de la obra de Torquemada no ha sido debidamente reconocida > por parte de los especialistas, pero aquellos que la han estudiado en > profundidad coinciden en hacer una valoraci√≥n muy positiva. (The importance > of Torquemada's work has not been properly recognised by specialists, but > those who have given it deep study concur in a very positive appraisal) And (2002):-Rubial Garc√≠a, at p. 351:- \\". . la obra de Torquemada era algo m√°s que una versi√≥n censurada de la de Mendieta. Con una visi√≥n universalista . . Con su estudio, la cultura ind√≠gena, m√°s bien la n√°huatl, se insertaba en el contexto de la civilizaci√≥n universal a la altura de Grecia, Roma o Egipto . . M√°s que un texto hist√≥rico, la obra de Torquemada es una especulaci√≥n teol√≥gica, surgida para explicar, dentro del esquema filos√≥fico occidental, la existencia de los indios americanos y el papel que su conquista y evangelizaci√≥n jugaron dentro del contexto de la historia de la salvaci√≥n\\". > Torquemada's work was more than a censored version of Mendieta's . . With > his study, indigenous culture - more particularly the Nahuatl - was inserted > into the context of universal civilisation on a par with Greece, Rome and > Egypt . . More than an historical text, Torquemada's work is a theological > speculation developed in order to explain, within a western philosophical > framework, the existence of the American Indians and the role that their > conquest and evangelisation play in the context of the history of salvation. > (translation from the Spanish original) As for the author's style, opinions diverge. A judicious and broadly positive assessment such as this was made in 1890 by the American historian and ethnologist Hubert Howe Bancroft:-Bancroft, p. 505. > He rises above the mere monk chronicler and strives to interest his readers > by variety of topics, as well as by treatment, which receives no > inconsiderable aid from a descriptive power of rare occurrence among his > confreres; other faults remain, however. While concise enough in the > narrative generally, he abandons himself to inappropriate deviations and > wordy argument, and revels in learned references. By contrast, a non-specialist (who thought Torquemada arrived in New Spain in 1583 and made other elementary mistakes about his life in the few sentences he devoted to it) offered this observation which can be taken to be representative of the opposite tendency:-Preibish, p. 20. At the time, he was librarian and Hispanic and Luso-Brazilian bibliographer at Syracuse University (New York). > The value of Monarquia Indiana as a history of prehispanic Mexico and of its > conquest by Cortes is marginal. This hodgepodge of facts and fiction and of > a few interesting details lost in tedious disquisitions is important for > other reasons. . . The merit of Torquemada, if merit it be, is the fact that > in his compilation he quoted [..] unpublished chronicles, sometimes > mentioning the names of their authors, sometimes plundering parts of their > work for his Monarqu√≠a Indiana, thus saving them from oblivion. Torquemada's > plagiarism of Jeronimo de Mendieta's work . . part of which he included in > his pot-pourri without any change, proved very useful to Joaqu√≠n Garc√≠a > Icazbalceta [etc.] A statue of Blessed Sebastian outside the Franciscan church in Puebla =Minor works= One other work published in his lifetime is known, a hagiography of fray Sebasti√°n de Aparicio, a Franciscan lay brother who had died on 25 February 1600 and whose reputation of exemplary living resulted in his beatification in 1789.Ronald J. Morgan, Spanish American Saints and the Rhetoric of Identity, Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 2002, pp. 39-66. Known by its shortened title Vida y milagros del santo confesor de Cristo, fray Sebasti√°n de Aparicio (The Life and Miracles of the Holy Confessor of Christ, Friar Sebasti√°n de Aparicio), it was printed in 1602 by Diego L√≥pez D√°valos at the presses of the Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco, and in Seville in 1605.See the pr√≥logo of Juan Bautista to his Sermonario en lengua mexicana (1606).

When the Tower of Terror opened on 23 January 1997, it was the first roller coaster in the world to reach speeds making it the tallest and fastest roller coaster in the world of its time. The ride was situated on the Dreamworld Tower which also houses The Giant Drop free fall ride. The ride was originally known as the Tower of Terror until it was modified and relaunched in September 2010. The steel and concrete structure cost A$16 million to construct. The original ride featured a shorter, tunnel, a rigid lap bar using a hydraulic locking system and would carry 15 passengers at a time. The relaunched ride takes 14 passengers. It propels passengers to just under with a maximum of 4.5 g and 6.5 seconds of weightlessness. As of 2010, the ride was 4th in the tallest roller coaster rankings, 3rd in the tallest roller coaster drop rankings and 4th in the fastest roller coaster rankings. On 24 October 2019 the park announced that the Tower of Terror II would close on 3 November the same year, to make room for future development and expansion to the park. The park also confirmed that The Giant Drop will continue to operate as normal, with the Tower of Terror II track being removed from the Dreamworld Tower structure over time. History =Construction and opening= The construction of the Tower of Terror required a mammoth effort by those involved. The ride features more than of steel, of concrete (which was delivered by 175 concrete trucks), of paint and over 16,000 bolts which hold the structure together. Total construction costs were estimated to be A$16 million. On 23 January 1997, the Tower of Terror was officially opened by Rob Borbidge, Premier of Queensland at the time. A plaque was dedicated in its honour detailing its opening status as the tallest and fastest ride in the world. The original logo. =Original ride= The original Tower of Terror ride was themed as an \\"escape pod\\" launch from a futuristic skyscraper to a distant building. Earthquakes had supposedly made the building unstable and unexplained nuclear hazards were contaminating the building. Riders took the role of people queuing for the escape pods through the corridors and stairwells of the building, at one point crossing a depth illusion giving the impression of being high above a ruined city. Whilst the optical illusion and decoration of the queuing area remains, the backstory of the ride was no longer given. Upon reaching the front of the queue, 15 riders boarded the \\"escape pod\\". Riders would be launched forwards out of a shorter, tunnel at a rate of before travelling up the tower. The car then returned along the track backwards under the force of gravity and was slowed by electromagnets as it re-entered the tunnel. Riders would then complete the thematic \\"escape\\" by travelling down an elevator to safety. Just 0.25 seconds after the initial launch, an on-ride camera would take photographs of riders. Escape Pod The original Escape Pod launching up the Dreamworld Tower. The first steel passenger vehicle, known as the Escape Pod, would carry 15 passengers in four rows and weighed around . The car was equipped with four large steel road wheels that run on the track, measuring in diameter at the front and at the rear. Smaller jockey wheels run on the other side of the track such that the track sits between the pairs of wheels. The original Tower of Terror's restraint system consisted of a thick, rigid lap bar with hand grips mounted to the lap bar. These restraints used a hydraulic locking system (rather than a ratchet) which allowed them to be pulled down to any position; when \\"locked\\", they could move down to any position but not up. In contrast, a ratchet-based restraint only locks at each \\"notch\\", and will often be too loose or uncomfortably tight for riders. The minimum height restriction was , the same as most other major coasters. In addition, it was actually possible for a rider to be too tall to ride the Tower of Terror, if they are over tall. =Relaunch= The first speculations about a relaunch of the Tower of Terror began in December 2009. A Gold Coast Bulletin report detailed a variety of new attractions for the Gold Coast theme parks including the major relaunch of one of Dreamworld's Big 7 Thrill Rides. Although the Tower of Terror was not mentioned in the article, amusement park fanatics agreed that the Tower of Terror would be the most likely to receive the makeover. In February 2010, further fuel was added to the fire when a theme park reporter commented on the possibility of the Tower of Terror featuring a new, backwards launching vehicle. Towards the end of April 2010, steel framework arrived beside the Tower of Terror's launch track. The curved parts confirmed rumours that the tunnel would be extended. In August 2010, Dreamworld officially announced through their website that the Tower of Terror will cease operations on 18 August 2010 and will reopen as the Tower of Terror II in time for the September school holidays. Dreamworld confirmed the rumour that the launch will be in reverse out of the newly extended tunnel. The ride was relaunched on 17 September 2010. =Retirement = Just months after the closure of Wipeout, the park announced on 25 October 2019 that the Tower of Terror ll would cease operation on 3 November of the same year. The park cited \\"focusing our investment on the future and delivering new, world-class attractions for you to enjoy\\" as the reason for closing the attraction, along with initial details regarding a multi-million dollar expansion to the park. The expansion is set to include a new Multi-launch coaster, as well as a major refurbishment to ABC Kids World. The park also confirmed that The Giant Drop will continue to operate as normal, with the Tower of Terror II track being removed from the Dreamworld Tower structure over time. Experience Tower of Terror II's entrance back into the tunnel features a Low Clearance sign. Tower of Terror II's new car descending the Dreamworld Tower. =Queue and station= The queue begins with a footpath that extends from the underpass linking Tiger Island and Wiggles World, to the inside of an tall skull. From there, the line bends into a tunnel where riders have to walk 270 degrees anti-clockwise, crossing a metal bridge below which a model city is displayed. This was followed by some stairs at the top of which was a Dreamworld staff member in charge of letting people pass. Fourteen people at a time are allowed to pass through to the second waiting area where they wait for instructions to proceed. In the third waiting area, riders are asked to form four queues with two people in the front queue and four people in each of the remaining three queues. The doors to the Escape Pod then open up, allowing riders to embark. In the station, a kicker tyre system was used to propel the car into the launch, and also to stop the returning car. Once in the launch, a linear synchronous motor (LSM) system was used to accelerate the car along the horizontal part of the track, and also to slow the returning car. =Vehicle= The new passenger vehicle, called the 'Escape Pod', seats 14 riders in a configuration consisting of three rows of 4 and one of two. The vehicle features a lower-profile than its predecessor. Tower of Terror II Escape Pod pictured ascending the Dreamworld Tower. Ride Up to 14 riders at a time are electro-magnetically accelerated to in seven seconds along the extended, launch tunnel. The track then pitches up 90 degrees to the vertical, with the passengers pulling 4.5Gs. Riders are almost weightless during the entire vertical section of the ride for about 6.5 seconds, 3.25 seconds going up and 3.25 seconds falling back down. The car then pitches back down to horizontal and enters the tunnel where an on-ride camera takes photographs of riders. The vehicle continues to hurtle back into the station where it comes to a fairly rapid stop. =Exit= Following the ride, riders are let out an exit on the opposite side to the entry, which leads into a passageway containing a metal lift. This takes the riders back down to ground level and opens up to the Tower of Terror Warehouse merchandise shop. The shop contains souvenirs and photos of the riders in the Escape Pod for purchase.Dreamworld and WhiteWater World Park Map (2009). Popular culture The Tower of Terror was featured on the opening sequences of Big Brother Australia from 2001‚Äì2004. The Dreamworld Tower which houses the Tower of Terror II and the Giant Drop. Records At the time of opening, in January 1997, the Tower of Terror was the tallest and fastest roller coaster in the world. The ride held this title by itself for two months until it was superseded by in height by a twin- tracked version named Superman: The Escape (since similarly rethemed as Superman: Escape from Krypton), located at Six Flags Magic Mountain in the United States. Although the ride experience of the two rides is identical, the structure of Superman: The Escape is slightly taller. The title of the World's Fastest Roller Coaster was shared between the two rides for the next four years until Dodonpa at Fuji-Q Highland opened in December 2001. The title of the World's Tallest Roller Coaster Drop remained for a longer period of time. In 2003, Top Thrill Dragster opened at Cedar Point with a drop taller than the drop of the Tower of Terror. When it was removed, Tower of Terror II was still the fourth tallest, the fifth fastest, and had the third-longest drop among steel roller coasters in the world.

At their initiative and on the site of a former manor Krusenstern√≥w, a neoclassical style mansion was built, and near this a steam brewery was constructed. The Doilidy Brewery was founded in 1891. It was taken over by the Lubomirski family in 1920 and went through a huge modernisation. =World War I= During the period of World War I, the complex survived almost intact as Dojlidy Brewery. Unfortunately, in 1915 the Russians took all the equipment from the brewery. =The interwar years= Dojlidy Brewery After Poland regained independence in 1919, the General Administrator of goods, Baron Rudolf von Brandstein, through various informal discussions with the government authorities, managed to get permission to re-launch the brewery. The permit for the reconstruction was obtained despite the fact that the owner of the property Dojlidy, Sophia Kruzensztern√≥w R√ºdiger, lived permanently in Berlin and did not have Polish citizenship, so that the Minister of Agriculture and National Goods, under the law on agrarian reform, issued December 30, 1919 by the decision of acquisition of assets under state management.

The entire property was sold to Prince George Lubomirski Raphael, in whose possession the beer company underwent a complete renovation. In the late twenties Dojlidy brewery occupied the seventh place in terms of beer production in the country and was the biggest such facility on the east of Poland. Dojlidy beer was sold in Grodno, Brest, Vilnius, Slonim, Baranovichi, Warsaw and others.

Biography Born in Lamego, Portugal in 1930, Lemos Pires moved to Lisbon at age 18 to commence his studies at the Portuguese Military Academy. Following his graduation as an officer, he took up various overseas postings in the Portuguese Overseas Empire. In the 1960s Lemos Pires was posted to Algeria (then a French colony), where he studied French military counter-guerrilla techniques. After Algeria he was posted as part of the 114th Battalion to Portuguese Angola, which was in the midst of a conflict for independence, and where he took part in the early stages of the early colonial war. By the late 1960s, he was posted back to Portugal, where he administer physical education programs for the army, but was soon sent to Portuguese Guinea, under the command of Military Governor Ant√≥nio de Sp√≠nola, raising to the rank of colonel. Governor of Portuguese Timor On 14 November 1974, Lemos Pires was appointed by the new Portuguese Government (following the Carnation Revolution) as Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the overseas province of Portuguese Timor. Posted to what was thought to be one of the more peaceful Portuguese territories, Lemos Pires found himself in the middle of a brewing conflict in Timor, while charged by the government to prepare Timor for independence. One of his first decrees made upon his arrival in Dili was to legalise political parties in preparation for elections to a Constituent Assembly in 1976. In August 1975, one of those political parties, the Timorese Democratic Union (UDT) staged a coup against the Portuguese administration, prompting the outbreak of a three-month civil war, with many UDT politicians and supporters fleeing across the border to West Timor in Indonesia, where they were required to sign a petition calling for East Timor's incorporation into Indonesia. As a result of the conflict, Lemos Pires ordered the withdrawal of the Portuguese administration to the island of Atauro, off Dili. With opinion at home becoming increasingly detached from political developments in Timor, and more concerned with decolonisation in its African colonies of Angola and Mozambique than with Timor, Lemos Pires' attempts to broker an agreement between the UDT and the other prominent Timorese party, FRETILIN, were undermined, even while he insisted that he was awaiting instructions from the government in Lisbon. Without any possibility of support from Portugal, Lemos Pires maintained his administration for three months until he ordered a withdrawal of staff and left his post for Lisbon on 27 November 1975. Less than two weeks later, on 7 December, Indonesia invaded East Timor, leading to a situation of Indonesian occupation that would last until 1999. At the 2003 Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings held by East Timor, Lemos Pires explained his position at the time, as well as to why Portugal had failed to support Timor during the invasion: \\"We were so much more worried about what happened in Portugal than what happened in Timor. For example, they couldn't dispense forces - in good condition and with goodwill - to go to Timor to ensure security there. At the same time, for instance, we had no ambassador in Jakarta - and that was a very important post for us. And the political credibility of Portugal at that time was so low. Of course, if Portugal was prepared and had the force and political respect at that moment, we could have done better. The problem was that I became alone in that moment. Portugal forgot East Timor because on the one hand it was the revolution, on the other it was African decolonisation, and so many Portuguese there in such bad conditions.\\" Later life On his return to Lisbon, he was appointed commander of the Training Center for Special Operations and lectured at the Institute for Advanced Military Studies, of which he was Deputy Director. Later rising to be chief of staff of the Ministry of National Defense and the Director of the National Defence College. In 1982 he was promoted to Major- general and ended his military career as secretary general of the study center EuroDefense-Portugal. After his military career, he was vice president of the Fraternal Aid to Mozambique and published a book about his experiences in Timor entitled: Decolonization of Timor: Mission impossible?.

He spent most of his life in the Loire Valley of France. From his poetic works, especially his enormous 1508 poem Le livre de la deablerie, it can be inferred that he knew most of the famous composers of the time, even though his own musical works never approached theirs in renown. Life Although a long period of activity is documented for this composer, nothing is known of either his birth or death, other than that he likely was from Amerval in the Pas-de-Calais. Since he was listed as a tenor at the chapel in Savoy beginning in 1455, he probably was born before 1440. The choirmaster at the Savoy chapel at the time of Eloy's admission was Guillaume Dufay. Eloy spent most of his life serving in institutions connected with the French royal court. In 1464 and 1465 he is recorded as a singer for Charles, Duke of Orl√©ans. In 1468 and 1471 he is mentioned as choirmaster of the boys at St. Aignan in Orl√©ans. He had the same position at Ste. Croix Cathedral in Orl√©ans in 1483 (old scholarship reporting him in Milan, at the Sforza chapel, during the 1470s has been recently debunked). In 1504 he was a canon and priest at the chapel in Ch√¢teaudun, northwest of Orl√©ans and southwest of Chartres. He wrote his most famous poem, Le livre de la deablerie, in 1508, but it not known how long he lived after that. King Louis XII granted him explicit permission for its publication, and also granted him special payment for many years of service. Writings Eloy is most famous to music historians for having provided a long poem, Le livre de la deablerie, recounting a dialogue between Satan and Lucifer, in which their nefarious plotting of future evil deeds is interrupted periodically by the author, who among other accounts of earthly and divine virtue, records useful information on contemporary musical practice. In addition to listing musical instruments, he lists who he considers to be the great composers of the time: they are residents of Paradise in his poem, even though several were still alive in 1508, the date of its composition. A portion reads: :La sont les grans musiciens ... :Comme Dompstable et du Fay ... :Et plusiers aultres gens de bien: :Robinet de la Magdalaine, :Binchoiz, Fed√©, Jorges et Hayne, :Le Rouge, Alixandre, Okeghem, :Bunoiz, Basiron, Barbingham, :Louyset, Mureau, Prioris, :Jossequin, Brumel, Tintoris. He lists no composers in Hell, although several renowned composers (such as the notoriously wayward Jacob Obrecht) are conspicuously absent from his list. In 1508, in possibly the first reference to an April Fools' Day celebration, he referred to a 'poisson d‚Äôavril' (April fool, literally \\"Fish of April\\").Eloy d'Amerval, Le Livre de la Deablerie, Librairie Droz, p. 70. (1991). \\"De maint homme et de mainte fame, poisson d'Apvril vien tost a moy.\\" Music Eloy composed motets celebrating the 1429 liberation of Orl√©ans from the English by Joan of Arc, although the music is lost (only the texts survive). A payment record remains, as well as a mention of the first performance, which took place on May 8, 1483, the 54th anniversary of the original thanksgiving ceremony. Eloy also wrote a five- voice mass which survives, the Missa Dixerunt discipuli, an elaborate tour-de- force of contrapuntal practice, which was praised by Tinctoris. The mass was likely composed around 1470, since the date of Tinctoris's publication was 1472-1475, and three- and four-voice imitative sections such as appeared within it were quite rare before 1470.

Early life  Bryan was born in Houston, Texas on March 21, 1946. He attended Mirabeau B. Lamar High School in Houston where he excelled in football and boxing. At the age of 16 he became one of the youngest Golden Gloves contenders. Bryan received from the University of Texas a BA in 1968 and a law degree, graduating Phi Delta Phi in 1970. He was one of two law graduates in the United States chosen to work in Washington, DC for Ralph Nader, focusing on the passage of the Clean Water Act. In 1973, Bryan received an MBA from Harvard Business School.  Career  In 1973, Bryan joined Morgan Stanley in the mergers and acquisitions department. He left Morgan Stanley in 1977 and moved to Houston to form an oil and gas company, Austin Resources Corporation, and a bank holding company, with Ned Holmes, which became Prosperity Bank, one of the largest Texas based banks. In 1980, Bryan moved back to New York to partner with Jan Stenbeck and set up a company, Millicom, to operate voice and data distribution which became cellular telephony. Bryan served as president of Millicom from 1981-1994. Millicom received one of the first three US cellular developmental licenses in 1981. In addition to operations in the United States, Millicom went on to form cellular joint ventures in over 20 countries throughout the world including Mexico, Hong Kong, the Soviet Union, the Philippines and Pakistan. One of the companies, Vodafone, was formed in partnership with the British company, Racal Electronics. The company, currently at a market capitalization in excess of $200 billion, is the second largest cellular company in the world. In 1981, Millicom formed a company, Microtel Communications, in partnership with British Aerospace and Pacific Telesis which was awarded by the British government a personal communications network ‚ÄúPCN‚Äù which competed with Vodafone. The service branded as Orange was later acquired by France Telecom which subsequently changed its name to Orange. In 1994, Bryan was asked to step in to replace the CEO of ICG Communications, which was in the midst of financial failure. Brought in by ICG's board of directors as a change agent, Bryan turned the failing company around by immediately replacing the management team with more experienced, higher caliber professionals and implementing a new business plan. He successfully raised more than $2 billion in financing, and from 1996‚Äì1999 revenues were raised 10 times from approximately $50 million to $500 million. By the end of 1999 ICG was carrying approximately 15% of the world's internet traffic. That historical improvement in revenues enabled the company to grow from 125 to more than 3,500 employees. At the time, ICG was one of the first telecom companies aggressively deploying fiber in metropolitan areas. Bryan saw the warning signs of the looming dot- com bust: an overbuilt, unpredictable industry that was over-funded. When he shared his concerns with the company's stakeholders, his prediction was very unpopular. Bryan stepped down from his role at ICG in 2000 when the company, like most of those in the Internet business, began to face difficult times during the dot-com meltdown. Following his departure from ICG, Bryan went on to form Pingtone Communications, one of the first VOIP (Voice over IP) companies in the United States. BusinessWeek currently lists Bryan as chairman and chief executive officer of the Washington, D.C.-based company.http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=3641854  Politics  A supporter of Democratic politics Bryan served as the National Finance Chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 1988-1989. He served on the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board from 1999-2001. Personal life Bryan started boxing when he was 14 years old, and at age 16 became one of the youngest Golden Gloves contenders. Bryan and his first wife, Lucia, have two daughters, Ashley and Alexis. After divorcing Lucia, Bryan married his second wife Katherine, and had two sons, Austin and film director Jack. Three of his four children live in New York (Ashley, Austin and Jack), and Alexis lives in Beverly Hills. Bryan gained media attention in 1999 when he started an affair with renowned Vogue Editor in Chief, Anna Wintour. The two met at a Benefit Ball for the New York Ballet. Both Bryan and Wintour ended their marriages and since then have maintained their close, committed relationship and live together in New York's Greenwich Village. Bryan continues to maintain a residence in Houston. While he does accompany Wintour to high-profile fashion, cultural and fundraising events, Bryan intentionally flies \\"under the radar.\\" The couple also enjoys traveling and attending U.S. Open tennis matches. Bryan was chairman of the Texas Chamber Orchestra, and is a financial contributor to New York's Metropolitan Opera, the Houston Fine Arts Museum, and the Houston Grand Opera. Bryan also served on the Board of The Actors Studio in the late 1980s. His personal ties to the performing arts include a first cousin, Peter Masterson, who was co- author and director of the hit Broadway musical The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas. Another cousin, Horton Foote, won two Academy Awards for his screenplays as well as the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. And Bryan himself, in 1983, co-produced the off-Broadway play The Last of the Knucklemen.

It was a digital wireless cable, internet service, and web hosting provider. It was once linked to former crown corporation Teleglobe and Chinese ISP Inter Pacific Online. Founded in 1997, Look's head office was in Milton, Ontario, though most of its departments and employees were based in its Montreal office. It was listed on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbols \\"LOK\\" and \\"LOK.A\\". Look had approximately 60,000 television customers at its peak. Look had the slogan \\"At Look, it's simple!\\".  History  Look TV was founded in August 1997 as digital wireless cable provider based in Etobicoke, Ontario. It started providing television service in 1997 for Southern Ontario, and 1998 for Quebec and Eastern Ontario. In 1999, Look TV and Internet Direct (Canadian ISP operating in B.C., Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec.) merged to become Look Communications, with Look stockholders receiving 60% of the combined entity and Internet Direct stockholders receiving the remaining 40%. Look Communications filed for bankruptcy protection in 2001. Beginning in 2002, Unique Broadband System (UBS) acquired a stake in Look. By the end of 2003, UBS owned 51% of Look's stock, making Look a subsidiary of UBS. At that time, Look moved its headquarters from Oakville, Ontario to UBS's headquarters in Milton, Ontario. Despite re-emerging from bankruptcy in 2002, Look never regained profitability and continued losing millions of dollars for the years to come. On December 1, 2008, Look Communications announced that it was selling off its assets. On May 14, 2009, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice approved the sale to Inukshuk Wireless Partnership. On November 15, 2009, Look's television customer base was acquired by Bell Canada which folded it into its Bell Satellite TV division while the internet consumer base was absorbed by Telnet Communications. Although Look Communications no longer had any customers and had terminated its employees, the company still existed and was in the process of liquidating its remaining assets. On March 26, 2013, Look Communications announced a proposed change of business by acquiring all of the outstanding shares of Sunwave Gas & Power Inc. (\\"Sunwave\\"), a supplier of innovative, competitive energy products and services. On July 9, 2013, the acquisition was completed. On July 12, 2013, Look Communications Inc. changed its name for ONEnergy Inc., a company classified as a natural gas supplier based in Toronto, Ontario. Service offered Look provided its digital television and wireless Internet services using a Multichannel Multipoint Distribution System (MMDS) technology, operating with 90 MHz of capacity in the 2.5 GHz band (the only company in Canada with approximately 90 MHz of spectrum and a broadcast license for mobile video services in Canada). Look had exclusive use of these frequencies since it received licenses from the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) as a \\"broadcast distribution undertaking\\". With this MMDS technology, television, audio and data signals were received at Look's headend and digitally transmitted via fibre optics links to broadcast sites. The signals were then broadcast over the air from one of several transmission towers or base stations to a receiving antenna at subscribers' homes or businesses.

The temple construction started in the early 1970s and thereafter developmental activities continued through earnings and donations from temple visitors, followers of Baba Khadeswari and Dugda Coal Washery's employees. Baba Khadeswari was a Sadhu from Uttar Pradesh, who had visited this place in the early seventies and had decided to build a temple on the hill top. He never spoke and communicated only through sign language. He stood throughout his life and used to wear wooden paduka. Today the temple has become a small tourist attraction. Pucca road from the bottom of the hill till the hill top has already been constructed.

The town is about 45 km east of Dibrugarh City. It is particularly known for its oil related industry, Oil India Limited, one of the country's largest oil and gas companies. There was also other central government owned companies like B.C.P.L company of gas cracker & polymer, N.E.E.P.C.O., B.F.C.L. and the Shivani company which is India's largest private company for drilling. Assam Gas Company Limited, which carries out business related to natural gas in India owned by the Government of Assam, is also located in this township.  History  Duliajan derived its name from \\"Dulia\\" meaning \\"palanquin-bearers\\" of the Ahom kings and \\"Jan\\" meaning \\"a river stream\\". The Ahom kings, also known as Swargadeos, were very fond of hunting in the Upper Dihing forests. The Swargadeos would come by boats from their capital of Gargaon and Rangpur (in Sivasagar district) down the Dikhow river to the mighty Brahmaputra, then row upstream, enter the Dihing river and halt at the mouth of the stream near Tipling-Ghat in present-day Duliajan. The stream was a guiding pathway for the palanquin bearers of the Swargadeos. Thus, when a new oil town was constructed in this area, to honour the palanquin bearers, it became a natural choice for the historical name of Duliajan. As per another legend, Dulia khel (a sub-community of Ahom) first settled on the bank of a small rivulet Duriajan which is in the village of Kachari Pathar. This Duriajan was used by the Dulia community and gradually people started calling the rivulet Duliajan. The entire town that mushroomed around the rivulet was then named after the same water body. After the Ahom king Suhanfa was killed in a conspiracy, according to prevalent custom those days, the ministers of Suhanfa‚Äôs cabinet selected his son Supinfa as his successor. Immediately after ascending the throne, Supinfa investigated the killing of his father and found one of his minister Laturban and his sons as the main conspirators. Swargadeo Supimfa then ordered that Laturban and his sons be beheaded for the heinous crime. Accordingly, on the banks of a small river, far away from the Ahom capital, the order was carried out. As the place was far from the capital and near to a river bank, the place came to be known as \\"Duroijan\\" where in the Assamese language means \\"far distant\\" and means \\"rivulet\\". It is said from \\"Duraijan\\" the word Duliajan came in focus. There is no official record about the exact date of declaration of the oil town as Duliajan. But it started initially with a nucleus of experienced personnel drawn from the Assam Oil Company (AOC) as well as Burmah Oil Company (BOC), the pioneer organizations of Digboi Oilfield. Oil India formally set up its own organization on 1 January 1962 to look after all aspects of drilling and exploration operations, with its headquarters at Duliajan, then known as Zaloni in the Nahorkatiya area. The establishment of Duliajan oil town may be said to have brought about an era of petroleum industries in the district of Lakhimpur which then comprised the present districts of Dibrugarh and Tinisukia on the south bank and Lakhimpur and Dhemaji on the north bank of the river Brahmaputra. Since its establishment, this fast-growing town has been playing a vital role in the state‚Äôs as well as country‚Äôs economy. Climate In Duliajan, the climate is warm and temperate. In winter there is much less rainfall than in summer. According to K√∂ppen and Geiger, the climate is classified as Cwa. The average annual temperature in Duliajan is 23.2 ¬∞C. The average annual rainfall is 2528 mm. The driest month is December with 21 mm. Most precipitation falls in July, with an average of 489 mm. The warmest month of the year is August with an average temperature of 27.8 ¬∞C. In January, the average temperature is 16.1 ¬∞C. It is the lowest average temperature of the whole year. Climate TableThe difference in precipitation between the driest month and the wettest month is 468 mm. The average temperatures vary during the year by 11.7 ¬∞C. Demographics As of the 2011 India census, Duliajan had a population of 28,626:- 14,898 males and 13,728 females, giving a sex ratio 921 which was lower than the state average of 958. Duliajan had an average literacy rate of 93.98% (male 96.57%, female 91.16%) much higher than the state average of 72.19%. 9.63% of the total population was under 6 years of age. Transportation Duliajan is well linked to the cities and towns of the state and also to the rest of the country. The closest airport is the Mohanbari Airport in the outskirts of Dibrugarh, which is at a distance of 41 km and connects the rest of the country to the Oil Town. From the airport, there are taxis available to Duliajan. The town also has a railway station for transportation within Assam and the rest of the country. As the closest railway junctions are at Dibrugarh and Tinsukia (which is at a distance of only 20 km), most trains do not stop at Duliajan even when they pass through the town. However, the few trains that make stoppages at the station are Kamrup Express, Intercity Express, Dibrugarh-Kamakhya SPL, New Tinsukia- Ranjendra Nagar SPL and Dibrugarh-Rangiya SPL. Road transport is another important backbone for the town to connect with the rest of the state. Easily accessible by road by a branch-off (40 km) from national highway NH-37, Duliajan is also well connected to the nearest district headquarters of Tinsukia and Dibrugarh. NH-37 traverses the state of Assam connecting all major towns and cities. Buses, both private and ASTC, on a daily basis, ply to Guwahati, Nagaon, Jorhat, Dibrugarh, Tinsukia and even to parts of Arunachal Pradesh. Buses are sometimes, locally referred to as \\"Supers\\".

The local football club, Oil India Ltd FC is a member of the AIFF and played in the I-League 2nd Division. The team is the current winner of Assam Club Football Championship. The Oil India Ground or Nehru Maidan, which is also the home ground of Oil India Ltd FC, has hosted a number of national and state level football tournaments. District level cricket tournaments and also state level Athletics Games have also been hosted here. It has a capacity of 10,000 people. Festivals By being the headquarters of OIL, Duliajan has become home to people from all corners of the country, some of whom have settled down to start businesses and others as employees in OIL. The main festivals celebrated are Bihu, Krishna Janmashtami, Maha Shivaratri, Eid al Fitr, Christmas, Eid al-Adha, Durga Puja, Kali Puja, Saraswati Puja, Dussehra and Vishwakarma Puja. Chhath Puja is celebrated by the Bihari community and Ganesh Chaturthi is mainly celebrated by the Telugu community of the town. Rath Yatra or Kang is celebrated by the Manipuri community to worship Lord Jagannath. Me-Dam-Me-Phi is celebrated by the Tai-Ahom community on 31 January every year in memory of the departed. It is the manifestation of the concept of ancestor worship that the Ahoms share with other peoples originating from the Tai-Shan stock. It is a festival to show respect to the departed ancestors and remember their contribution to society. Sankardev Tithi, Madhavdev Tithi and Janmashtami are observed by the Assamese community in memory of the two Vaishnavite saints from Medieval Assam.

Its bell tower has been a landmark in Washington County for over a century. It is designated as a historic public landmark by the Washington County History & Landmarks Foundation. History =Spring Hill= The historic section of the school was once Trinity Hall School for Boys that operated from 1879 to 1906. The historic school grounds in North Franklin Township date back to the 1850s when Joseph McKnight built a home on top of a hill overlooking the then-borough of Washington, Pennsylvania. This twenty-five room Italianate mansion called Spring Hill now functions as the district's administrative offices connected to Trinity High School. Spring Hill was purchased by William Smith, a prominent Washington dry goods merchant, as the new home for his son. The Smith family hired Boston- based landscape artist Robert Morris Copeland to prepare the grounds along Catfish Creek before it was occupied by William Wrenshaw Smith and his wife Emma Willard McKennan Smith. Wrenshaw Smith was a cousin to Julia Dent, wife of President Ulysses S. Grant. Wrenshaw Smith also served as Grant's aide-de- camp during the Civil War and Grant visited the Spring Hill mansion on multiple occasions. =Trinity Hall School for Boys= William Wrenshaw Smith was a devout Episcopalian and longtime vestryman at Trinity Episcopal Church, then located on Beau Street near Washington and Jefferson College. During the 1860s, Smith worked alongside John Barrett Kerfoot, newly elected Bishop of Pittsburgh, to create a boys‚Äô school following the curricular model of famed priest-educator William Augustus Muhlenberg. In this model, ‚Äúthe school was to be like a large family with a priest as rector serving as father-figure in loco parentis.‚Äù Trinity Hall operated from 1870 to 1906 attracting members of prominent regional families including Heinz, Carnegie, Kammerer, and LeMoyne along with a grandson of President Grant. In 1883, Trinity School for Boys began adopting elements of Muscular Christianity. This included a ‚Äúmilitary department‚Äù for purposes of exercise and a more generic Protestant Christianity in place of Muhlenberg's strictly Episcopalian church school model. Sometimes this leads to overemphasis on the military nature of the school and mistaken conclusions that Trinity Hall was a strict military academy.Crompton, Janice. \\"SUPERINTENDENT PUSHES FOR TRINITY HALL RESTORATION\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, November 29, 1998. Accessed July 31, 2007. Various Episcopal priests served as school rector until the 1890s when patron William Wrenshaw Smith became lay rector, a change possibly due to declining enrollment and revenue. Trinity Hall closed in 1906, two years after Smith's death. =Trinity Hall becomes Trinity High= Trinity Hall, a Smith family property, stood vacant for nearly two decades. In 1922, it was unsuccessfully considered as a site for relocating Presbyterian-affiliated Washington Female Seminary. Then in 1925 the townships of Amwell, Canton, North Franklin, and South Strabane purchased the Trinity Hall property to repurpose as a joint public high school. The sale nearly fell through. Amwell Township's secretary refused to sign documents until forced to do so by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The classroom block of Trinity Hall was used from 1883 until 2004. It was demolished in 2006. The Spring Hill section of Trinity Hall continues to serve as offices for Trinity Area School District. Today, Trinity is a modern public school housing approximately 1,279 students in grades 9‚Äì12 on a campus-style setting.Data for Trinity High School, National Center for Education Statistics. Accessed July 31, 2007. Trinity Area School District maintains a small Trinity Hall Museum open by appointment only.  Academics program Trinity High School offers 13 Advanced Placement classes and two languages. Spanish and German. These language courses include classes from level one to level five honors. There are elective and core subjects in the areas of arts, music, business, English, science, history, mathematics, social studies, and journalism. Graduation rate In 2011, the Pennsylvania Department of Education issued a new, 4 year cohort graduation rate. Trinity School District's graduation rate was calculated to be 85% for 2010. Academic achievement In 2011, Trinity Senior High School declined to 'Warning' AYP status due to lagging mathematics achievement. The math achievement fell below the State AYP goal of 67% for Math and below the statewide 11th grade achievement level of 60% on grade level. In 2010, the school achieved AYP status. In 2011, the 11th grade ranked 40th among 122 western Pennsylvania school district 11th grades, for academic achievement as measured by five years of the PSSAs. Graduation requirements The Trinity Area School District School Board has determined that students must earn 22 credits to graduate. By law, all Pennsylvania secondary school students must complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district. At Trinity High School the graduation project includes: community service, school visitation, job shadowing and a written paper.  Activities and athletics  Trinity High School offers a wide variety of extracurricular activities and sports. Football, baseball, basketball, soccer, cross-country, track, wrestling, volleyball, golf, rifle, lacrosse, ice hockey, swimming, softball, tennis, and cheerleading are available at Trinity. They are in the WPIAL AAA and AAAA divisions for their sports. The ice hockeyPIHL  Trinity Ice Hockey Club teams compete in the PIHL Open Division. Eligibility to participate in all extracurriculars and athletics is set by Trinity School Board policies.

Early life and airline career  Simonetti, one of three siblings, was raised in Durham and Raleigh, North Carolina. She spent a year in Bern, Switzerland as a high school exchange student, later dropping out of high school to become first a travel agent and then a flight attendant. She was first employed in the flight industry in 1996 with a charter airline based in Miami, Florida. After the charter went out of business, Simonetti was hired by Delta Air Lines. During her eight years with Delta, she flew German, Spanish, and Italian routes with the airline and completed her Bachelor of Arts degree in Spanish at the University of Texas at Austin. Blog and dismissal Simonetti began her \\"Queen of Sky: Diary of a Dysfunctional Flight Attendant\\" blog in September 2003 as a form of therapy after the loss of her mother to cancer. In addition to describing events of her life, Simonetti also described travel abroad, mainly Europe and South America, while working for Delta Air Lines. Simonetti adopted the pen name \\"Queen of Sky\\" for her blog. With practical information on worldwide travel described in a quirky, irreverent tone, the blog developed a considerable following. In late 2004, Simonetti was suspended and then fired after Delta Air Lines objected to Ellen posing for photographs on a company airplane and commentary on her blog. Simonetti subsequently renamed her blog \\"Diary of a Fired Flight Attendant.\\" Although Simonetti never mentioned Delta Airlines by name, the photos of her in uniform and the cabin clearly indicated the airline that she worked for. In addition, some of the blog content was deemed inappropriate such as her suggestive poses, including one photo where her legs were straddling the seat headrests with her skirt hiked up, and another where her shirt was unbuttoned to reveal her bra and some cleavage. Employers and bloggers These events became emblematic of the issue of employees' rights to communicate their own views of their work and workplace versus employers' rights to restrict them. There was considerable media coverage of Simonetti's firing and the freedom of expression issues involved. Simonetti advocates that: # employers should have clear, unambiguous blogging policies so that employees can foresee the potential for disciplinary action, and # the penalty for a first offense should be a formal warning rather than dismissal. Other individuals who have been fired for content in their personal blogs include Heather Armstrong, Jessica Cutler, Catherine Sanderson, Christine Axsmith, and Jan Pronk, United Nations Special Representative for Sudan, who was given three days notice to leave Sudan after the Sudanese army demanded his deportation for comments in his weblog. Aftermath In 2005, Simonetti filed a lawsuit against Delta (Simonetti v. Delta Air Lines Inc., No. 5-cv-2321 (N.D. Ga. 2005)), alleging, inter alia, sex discrimination and retaliation. After much media attention and legal maneuvering between sides, the case was eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. (Simonetti, though prohibited from disclosing the amount of her settlement, stated that it would be enough for her to attend culinary school, which she stated in her book ran to about $40,000.) Simonetti has discussed personal blogging rights on The Montel Williams Show and the Larry Elder show. She set up a Bloggers Rights petition and was a founding member of the Committee to Protect Bloggers. Simonetti has written articles for the news media including The New York Times and CNET, adapted her blog to a published book, and has worked in real estate. On her website she says that although she has kept her real estate licence, she is not using this and has \\"...gone back to school at the University of Texas (undergrad), where I'm currently a journalism major, but soon to be an RTF (radio/TV/film) major\\". On her blog, she claimed that a film company is to make a film about her life and she has agreed to this.

TDS concentrations are often reported in parts per million (ppm). Water TDS concentrations can be determined using a digital meter. Generally, the operational definition is that the solids must be small enough to survive filtration through a filter with 2-micrometer (nominal size, or smaller) pores. Total dissolved solids are normally discussed only for freshwater systems, as salinity includes some of the ions constituting the definition of TDS. The principal application of TDS is in the study of water quality for streams, rivers, and lakes. Although TDS is not generally considered a primary pollutant (e.g. it is not deemed to be associated with health effects), it is used as an indication of aesthetic characteristics of drinking water and as an aggregate indicator of the presence of a broad array of chemical contaminants. Primary sources for TDS in receiving waters are agricultural runoff and residential (urban) runoff, clay- rich mountain waters, leaching of soil contamination, and point source water pollution discharge from industrial or sewage treatment plants. The most common chemical constituents are calcium, phosphates, nitrates, sodium, potassium, and chloride, which are found in nutrient runoff, general stormwater runoff and runoff from snowy climates where road de-icing salts are applied. The chemicals may be cations, anions, molecules or agglomerations on the order of one thousand or fewer molecules, so long as a soluble micro- granule is formed. More exotic and harmful elements of TDS are pesticides arising from surface runoff. Certain naturally occurring total dissolved solids arise from the weathering and dissolution of rocks and soils. The United States has established a secondary water quality standard of 500 mg/l to provide for palatability of drinking water. Total dissolved solids are differentiated from total suspended solids (TSS), in that the latter cannot pass through a sieve of 2 micrometers and yet are indefinitely suspended in solution. The term settleable solids refers to material of any size that will not remain suspended or dissolved in a holding tank not subject to motion, and excludes both TDS and TSS. Settleable solids may include larger particulate matter or insoluble molecules. Measurement TDS meter used to test water purity The two principal methods of measuring total dissolved solids are gravimetric analysis and conductivity. Gravimetric methods are the most accurate and involve evaporating the liquid solvent and measuring the mass of residues left. This method is generally the best, although it is time- consuming. If inorganic salts comprise the great majority of TDS, gravimetric methods are appropriate. Electrical conductivity of water is directly related to the concentration of dissolved ionized solids in the water. Ions from the dissolved solids in water create the ability for that water to conduct an electric current, which can be measured using a conventional conductivity meter or TDS meter. When correlated with laboratory TDS measurements, conductivity provides an approximate value for the TDS concentration, usually to within ten-percent accuracy. The relationship of TDS and specific conductance of groundwater can be approximated by the following equation: :TDS = keEC where TDS is expressed in mg/L and EC is the electrical conductivity in microsiemens per centimeter at 25 ¬∞C. The correlation factor ke varies between 0.55 and 0.8. Some TDS meters will use this electrical conductivity measurement to then infer the number of parts per million (ppm); 1 ppm indicates 1 mg of dissolved solids per kg of water. Hydrological simulation Pyramid Lake, Nevada receives dissolved solids from the Truckee River. Hydrologic transport models are used to mathematically analyze movement of TDS within river systems. The most common models address surface runoff, allowing variation in land use type, topography, soil type, vegetative cover, precipitation, and land management practice (e.g. the application rate of a fertilizer). Runoff models have evolved to a good degree of accuracy and permit the evaluation of alternative land management practices upon impacts to stream water quality. Basin models are used to more comprehensively evaluate total dissolved solids within a catchment basin and dynamically along various stream reaches. The DSSAM model was developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).C.M. Hogan, Marc Papineau et al. Development of a dynamic water quality simulation model for the Truckee River, Earth Metrics Inc., Environmental Protection Agency Technology Series, Washington D.C. (1987) This hydrology transport model is actually based upon the pollutant- loading metric called \\"Total Maximum Daily Load\\" (TMDL), which addresses TDS and other specific chemical pollutants. The success of this model contributed to the Agency's broadened commitment to the use of the underlying TMDL protocol in its national policy for management of many river systems in the United States.EPA. \\"Guidance for Water Quality-Based Decisions: The TMDL Process.\\" Doc. No. EPA 440/4-91-001. April 1991. Practical implications Bristol Zoo, England. Maintenance of filters becomes costly with high TDS. When measuring water treated with water softeners, high levels of total dissolved solids do not correlate to hard water, as water softeners do not reduce TDS; rather, they replace magnesium and calcium ions, which cause hard water, with an equal charge of sodium or potassium ions, e.g. Ca2+ ‚áå 2 Na+, leaving overall TDS unchanged or even increased. Hard water can cause scale buildup in pipes, valves, and filters, reducing performance and adding to system maintenance costs. These effects can be seen in aquariums, spas, swimming pools, and reverse osmosis water treatment systems. Typically, in these applications, total dissolved solids are tested frequently, and filtration membranes are checked in order to prevent adverse effects. In the case of hydroponics and aquaculture, TDS is often monitored in order to create a water quality environment favorable for organism productivity. For freshwater oysters, trouts, and other high value seafood, highest productivity and economic returns are achieved by mimicking the TDS and pH levels of each species' native environment. For hydroponic uses, total dissolved solids is considered one of the best indices of nutrient availability for the aquatic plants being grown. Because the threshold of acceptable aesthetic criteria for human drinking water is 500 mg/l, there is no general concern for odor, taste, and color at a level much lower than is required for harm. A number of studies have been conducted and indicate various species' reactions range from intolerance to outright toxicity due to elevated TDS. The numerical results must be interpreted cautiously, as true toxicity outcomes will relate to specific chemical constituents. Nevertheless, some numerical information is a useful guide to the nature of risks in exposing aquatic organisms or terrestrial animals to high TDS levels. Most aquatic ecosystems involving mixed fish fauna can tolerate TDS levels of 1000 mg/l. Daphnia magna with eggs The Fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), for example, realizes an concentration of 5600 ppm based upon a 96-hour exposure. LD50 is the concentration required to produce a lethal effect on 50 percent of the exposed population. Daphnia magna, a good example of a primary member of the food chain, is a small planktonic crustacean, about 0.5 mm in length, having an LD50 of about 10,000 ppm TDS for a 96-hour exposure.Position Paper on Total Dissolved Solids, State of Iowa, IAC 567 61.3 (2)g et sequitur updated March 27, 2003 Spawning fishes and juveniles appear to be more sensitive to high TDS levels. For example, it was found that concentrations of 350 mg/l TDS reduced spawning of Striped bass (Morone saxatilis) in the San Francisco Bay-Delta region, and that concentrations below 200 mg/l promoted even healthier spawning conditions.Kaiser Engineers, California, Final Report to the State of California, San Francisco Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Program, State of California, Sacramento, CA (1969) In the Truckee River, EPA found that juvenile Lahontan cutthroat trout were subject to higher mortality when exposed to thermal pollution stress combined with high total dissolved solids concentrations. For terrestrial animals, poultry typically possess a safe upper limit of TDS exposure of approximately 2900 mg/l, whereas dairy cattle are measured to have a safe upper limit of about 7100 mg/l. Research has shown that exposure to TDS is compounded in toxicity when other stressors are present, such as abnormal pH, high turbidity, or reduced dissolved oxygen with the latter stressor acting only in the case of animalia. Environmental Protection Technology Series. Document No. EPA-660/2-73-003. In countries with often-unsafe/unclean tap water supplies, such as much of India, the TDS of drinking water is often checked by technicians to gauge how effectively their RO/Water Filtration devices are working. While TDS readings will not give an answer as to the amount of microorganisms present in a sample of water, they can get a good idea as to the efficiency of the filter by how much TDS is present.  Water classification  https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water- science-school/science/saline-water-and-salinity?qt- science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects Water can be classified by the level of total dissolved solids (TDS) in the water: *Fresh water: TDS is less than 1,000 mg/L *Brackish water: TDS = 1,000 to 10,000 mg/L *Saline water: TDS = 10,000 to 35,000 mg/L *Hypersaline:TDS greater than 35,000 mg/L Drinking water generally has a TDS below 500 mg/L. Higher TDS Fresh Water is drinkable but taste may be objectionable. Note: - There is general confusion in the literature about the units of TDS. Many sources equate mg/L (or kg/m3) with ppm. This is incorrect because ppm is a unit of weight/weight while mg/L is a unit of weight/volume so the solution density is required to convert one to the other. Only when the solution is very dilute, and the density is close to 1.0 does a value in ppm approach the value in mg/L. As the density increases, the error in taking ppm and mg/L to be equal increases.

It stars Michael Boatman and Lori Petty as rookie police officers who uncover a conspiracy around the arrest of a suspect (Ice Cube). After a festival run, it was released in the United States on June 2, 1995, and grossed $3.3 million. Plot John \\"J. J.\\" Johnson is a rookie deputy sheriff in the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department. Because of his inexperience and race, he experiences tension with his white colleagues as their first black deputy. Although he initially clashes with Deputy Deborah Fields, the department's first female deputy, they strike up a friendship. While on patrol, Johnson backs up Deputy Bono when he stops a black man, Teddy Woods, at a gas station. When Bono runs Woods' drivers license, he finds a warrant for his arrest. Woods reveals he has a stolen pistol in his car, and the police officers arrest him. Deputy Fields is the second deputy to the scene of a murder, but Detectives Baker and Hall dismiss her observations. Mr. Greenspan says a black man murdered his wife in a botched robbery, and the detectives pressure Woods to confess after they trace his stolen pistol to the murder. Woods defiantly proclaims his innocence, frustrating his lawyer, James Locket, who advises him to show less attitude in court. At the same time, community activist Reverend Banks raises awareness of the death of a black prisoner whom he believes to have been murdered by the police while in custody. Johnson dismisses the concerns of his family and girlfriend, saying there is no evidence of this. While coaching Bono on what to say at the trial, Johnson's commander, Clarence Massey, learns that Bono stopped Woods because of his race. Frustrated, Massey instructs him to come up with a better excuse. Bono suggests a traffic violation and later requests that Johnson back him up. Johnson agrees, and Massey praises him for his loyalty and dependability while chastising Fields for her refusal to fit in better. At the trial, Locket points out holes in the police testimony, making Johnson wonder if he made the right decision. Fields joins Johnson in investigating what really happened. With help from a whistleblower, they discover numerous cover-ups that involve Baker, Hall, and Massey. As the trial progresses and Greenspan's testimony proves problematic, Massey has Baker murder Greenspan to prevent him from becoming a liability. Hall, sick from cancer, dies at the station. Tensions rise as Johnson and Fields continue pursuing their own investigation, and they become further paranoid when Johnson insists they were intentionally given faulty intelligence during a drug raid. After Fields is hospitalized following an assault, Johnson and Baker come to blows. Massey breaks them up and temporarily places Johnson in a jail cell. When released, he delivers incriminating evidence to Locket that implicates Baker in various crimes, including the murder of the black prisoner and framing Woods. The jury can not reach a verdict. Facing a widespread investigation of police corruption that goes to the city council and mayor's office, the district attorney offers to drop the charges against Woods. Locket, with the reluctant backing of a city councilman, instead pushes for a new trial, which the judge accepts. Bono turns state's evidence and testifies against Johnson, admitting that the two committed perjury. Caught up in the probe, Johnson pleads guilty and receives a suspended sentence. After the sheriff's department is disbanded, Massey retires, Baker is sentenced to four years and is in an honor prison while appealing. The unit is disbanded and the other officers including Bono are reassigned.

Verinag is also the first tourist spot of Kashmir Valley when travelling by road from Jammu, the winter capital of the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir towards Srinagar, the summer capital of the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. It lies at the entry point of Kashmir Valley right after crossing Jawahar Tunnel and is also known as Gateway of Kashmir. A major tourist attraction of this place is Verinag Spring, for which this place is named. There is an octagonal stone basin at Verinag Spring and an arcade surrounding it which were built by Mughal emperor Jahangir in 1620 A.D. Later, a beautiful garden next to this spring, was laid out by his son Shah Jahan. This spring is known to never dry up or overflow. Verinag Spring is also the major source of river Jhelum.http://www.jktourismonline.com/kashmir-verinag.aspx Verinag Spring and Mughal Arcade surrounding it is officially recognized by Archaeological Survey of India as a Monument of National Importance. Etymology Verinag is derieved from Sanskrit word Vitastatra. Verinag Spring and Mughal Garden Verinag spring which is in Verinag town, issues from a high scarp of a mountain spur, and is considered the source of the Jhelum river. It is situated at the bottom of a hill covered by pine trees and evergreen plants. Verinag spring was originally an irregular and shapeless pond, and water, oozing out from different places in it and spread about and formed a little marsh. Emperor Jahangir, whose artistic taste for polishing the beauty of nature is well known, saw this and at once determined to improve it. He built the octagonal tank of sculptured stones round it, so that all water was collected therein, for which carvers were brought from Iran. A garden was also built by Jahangir next to this natural spring which is of pre-Islamic religious significance. The construction date of the octagonal tank and the garden is 1029 Hijri or 1620 A.D, during the 15th year of the Jahangir's reign, which is duly inscribed on a stone slab built into the southern wall of the spring. Seven years later, Jahangir's son Shah Jahan, who was no less a lover of natural beauty, constructed cascades and aqueducts in straight lines through and around the fine garden which he, in order to enhance further the beauty of the place laid out in front of the spring. He also built hot and cold baths to the east of this garden, just outside it, of which little trace is now left. The water contained in an octagonal spring has crystal blue water in which a variety of big fishes live. History and the carvings on stones in Persian on the walls surrounding the spring tell about how this great source of underwater spring is contained without revealing its architecture. The water is collected in a pool surrounded by arched recesses, and then flows down a 300-yard canal to the Bihat river. Jahangir wished to be buried at Verinag gardens, but his wife, Nur Jahan, disobeyed his wishes. Today nothing remains of the pavilions which once decorated the area.Plumptre, George: The Water Garden, page 39. Thames & Hudson Limited, London, 1993. According to a legend, goddess Vitasta(Jhelum) wanted to take rise from this spring, but it happened that when she came, Shiva was staying here, whereupon she had to go back and then she took her rise from Vithavatur(Vitastatra), a spring about a mile to the north-west of this place. Virah in Sanskrit means to 'go back' and 'nag' means a water spring and, as Vitasta had to go back from this place, it came to be called Virahnag or \\"Vernag\\". This spring is also considered to be the residing place of Nilanaga, who is placed by ancient tradition, at the head of all Nagas or spring-deities of Kashmir. Thus this spring is also known as \\"Nilakunda\\" or spring of Nila.Kalhana's Rajatarangini Vol. I by M.A. Stein, Motilal Banarasidass Publishers Pvt. Limited, 2009 According to Nilamata Purana, the valley of Kashmir was once a lake called \\"Satisara\\" or lake of Parvati. Near this spring, Lord Vishnu is said to have first placed the point of the plough with which Satisara was drained and here goddess Parvati was brought to light from the netherworld in the form of the river Vitasta by stroke of Lord Shiva's trident.The Nilamata Purana English Translation by Dr. Ved Kumari verses 247-261 The spring is at the exact centre almost 50 feet (as the locals tell about the depth) underwater from where the water continuously comes up and flows into the gardens facing the spring. It is also a sacred place for Hindus as there is a Lord Shiva shivling in one of the arcs (the very first on the left of the entry of the spring). The historical garden also has an old temple with some ancient idols of Hindu goddesses. Some 2 km away is Vithavatur(Vitastatra), supposed to be the source of river Jhelum. The waters of the many nearby springs, called collectively, Sapta Rishi, have their confluence at Sangam, where people bathe on festival days. The birth of the river is celebrated annually with a fair on the thirteenth day of the bright fortnight of the month Bhadrapada of the Hindu Calendar.http://www.verinag.com/ =Stone slabs= Stone slab on southern wall There are two stone slabs built into the western and southern walls of Verinag spring, on which prose in Persian language, in praise of the spring, and the dates of construction of the tank and aqueduct, are inscribed. The translation of prose in Persian language written on stone slab built into the southern wall of spring is as follows:- The king of seven kingdoms, the administrator of justice, the father of victory, Nur-ud-din, Jahangir son of Akbar, the martyr king, halted at this spring of God's grace in the 15th year of his reign. This construction was made by order of His Majesty. By Jahangir, son of King Akbar, This construction was raised to the skies. The architect of intelligence got its date--- 'May the mansion last for ever together with the spring Vernag!' (1029 Hijri) Stone slab on western wall The translation of prose in Persian language written on stone slab built into the western wall of spring is as follows:- Haidar, by order of Shah Jahan, the paramount lord of his age---- God be praised---made the cascade and aqueduct flow. This aqueduct reminds one of the aqueduct of paradise. By this cascade Kashmir attained glory The unseen Angel declared the date of aqueduct:- 'The aqueduct has issued from the heavenly spring' (1037 Hijri.) =Verinag Spring in historical texts= This spring has been mentioned in various historical texts. Various accounts of this spring are as follows: *Ain-i-Akbari: Ain-i-Akbari, is a 16th-century, detailed document recording the administration of emperor Akbar's empire, written by his vizier, Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak. The account of Verinag Spring in this text is as follows: Bihat, as mentioned in the above-quoted text, is the name of a river in Verinag. *Tuzk-e-Jahangiri: Tuzuk-e-Jahangiri or Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri is the autobiography of Mughal Emperor Nur-ud-din Muhammad Jahangir (1569-1627).

Verinag Spring in this text is known by the name of Nilakunda. The account of Verinag Spring in this text is as follows: The \\"land\\" referred to in above- quoted text is Kashmir. VitastƒÅ is another name for river Jhelum. =Verinag Mughal Garden Design= Verinag Mughal Garden Plan The design of the Verinag garden is an adaptation of the traditional Persian Charbagh(four gardens). The Charbagh takes its inspiration from the Quranic description of heaven as having four rivers, of wine, honey, milk, and water. The traditional Charbagh is uniformly shaped, with a water source in its center and four (char) radiating streams which divide the garden (bagh) into four parts. As with other Kashmiri gardens, Vernag is located on a steep hillside, with its water source at the top. The traditional Charbagh design had to be altered to fit the site's topography, as the source of water shifted from the traditional center of the square garden to the highest point of the garden. Given the limited options for flowing water (which could only run in one direction, from top to bottom), the double symmetry of the Persian garden was reduced to a central water axis, and the other traditional streams were minimized, appearing only in the form of the east‚Äìwest canal. The garden is rectangular in shape, measuring 460 meters by 110 meters. It runs a few degrees off a south‚Äìnorth axis, moving down the side of a hill. The garden is bisected on its long axis by a water canal that transfers water from the water source at the southern (upper) end into the Jhelum river on its northern end. Another canal running east‚Äìwest intersects the main water canal at its southern end. The entrances to the garden lie at both ends of this east‚Äìwest canal. From the entrances, a walkway takes the visitor towards the octagonal pool, which is approached through a colonnade.

He is the son of Grammy-winning Malian musician Ali Farka Tour√©. Biography Tour√© was born in Niafunk√©, Mali in 1981 to Ali Farka Tour√©. Despite his father's discouragement and his family's lineage as a tribe of soldiers, Tour√© secretly took up the guitar and enrolled in the Institut National des Arts in Bamako, Mali. In 2005, Eric Herman of Modiba expressed interest in producing an album for Tour√©; to do so, he had to acquire permission from Ali Tour√©, Toumani Diabat√©, and other community elders. This led to his self-titled debut album, produced by Modiba and released by World Village on 12 February 2007. The album featured Toumani Diabat√© as well as his late father. Following the release of a remix album, UFOs Over Bamako in 2008, and multiple tours, Vieux released his second studio album in May 2009. Fondo peaked at #5 on Billboard's World Albums chart the week of 11 July 2009 and was included in the Village Voice's Top 100 list for 2009. In June 2010, Vieux was invited to perform at the Opening Celebration of the 2010 FIFA World Cup; other performers included Shakira, Alicia Keys and K‚Äônaan. That month, Vieux also released his first live album, LIVE. Vieux released his third studio album, The Secret, on 24 May 2011. The album was produced by Soulive guitarist Eric Krasno and features Dave Matthews, Derek Trucks, and John Scofield. It also features the last collaboration between Tour√© and his late father. The album reached the #1 spot on CMJ's New World chart on 10 June 2011. Vieux's fourth studio album, Mon Pays, was released by Six Degrees Records on 28 May 2013. The title, French for 'My Country,' refers to his native Mali, and serves as a reminder of its beauty and culture, even in the midst of the territorial conflict between Tuareg and Islamic populations that have threatened it since January 2012. His latest album Samba was released in spring 2017. It was recorded in front of a live studio audience in Woodstock, NY. The title \\"Samba\\" has nothing to do with the Brazilian style of music; as the second boy in his family Vieux was always called \\"samba,\\" meaning \\"second boy\\" in Songhai, Additionally, the featured song ‚ÄúSamba Si Kairi\\" is named after a song his father and grandfather would sing while he played the calabash. Dominic Valvona of Monolith Cocktail praises the work, writing, \\"This is the devotional, earthy soul of Mali, channeled through a six-string electric guitar.\\"  The Tour√©-Raichel Collective  A chance meeting at an airport in Germany with Israeli singer- songwriter Idan Raichel led to an impromptu get together at a small studio in Tel Aviv in November 2010. Joined by Israeli bassist Yossi Fine and Malian calabash player Souleymane Kane, this recording session ‚Äì acoustic, spontaneous and entirely improvised ‚Äì resulted in the birth of The Tour√©- Raichel Collective. The group's debut album, The Tel Aviv Session, was released by Cumbancha on 27 March 2012. The Tour√©-Raichel Collective completed a North American tour in spring 2012 and European tours in autumn 2012 and spring 2013.

Geography Dusi is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Dusi It has an average elevation of 74 metres (242 feet). This Village have one of the five biggest reservoir (Dusi Mamandur Lake) of Tamil Nadu and it is 3 km away from Palar River Demographics India census, Dusi had a population of 5102. Males constitute 50% of the population and females 50%. Dusi has an average literacy rate of 60%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 71% and, female literacy is 48%. In Dusi, 13% of the population is under 6 years of age. This small village also have more link with the temple town Kancheepuram which is 9 km away. To this place, Lord Vardha (Varadharaja Perumal) will visit on every Chithira Pournami (around 15 April) to every house in the village.  Sri Vaikuntavasa Perumal temple - Dusi  Kanchipuram, once the capital of the Pallava dynasty, and the surrounding places are historic areas, and home to several ancient temples. This entire region was part of the well-known Thondaimandalam. Other than the fourteen famous Vishnu temples in Kanchipuram which are in the list of the 108 Divya Desams, there are many more in and around this sacred town which were once important religious centres. One such place, located on the southern bank of River Palar, about 10 km from Kanchipuram is known by the quaint name of Dusi. The original name of this village was Satakopapuram as Sri Adi Van Satakopan, the first preceptor of the Ahobila Math stayed here for a few years. Much later, the name changed to Dusi as the armies of the British and French, which were stationed in areas nearby, used to march (against the Nawab of Arcot) through this place, raising a lot of dust ( dusi in Tamil). It was once known as Chaturvedimangalam, place where scholars well-versed in the Vedas and allied Sastras lived. The Vaikunthavasa Perumal temple in this village is believed to belong to the Pallava times just like the Vaikunta Perumal temple in Kanchipuram which was constructed in the reign of Nandivarman II Pallavamalla (731-798 A.D.). The main deity is a majestic image, flanked by Sridevi and Bhudevi (Ubhaya Nachiyar). Goddess Lakshmi is worshipped here as Santhanavalli Thayar in a separate shrine. There are also images of the Vaishnava saints, Nammazhvar and Tirumangai Azhwar and preceptors (acharyas). Incidentally, Tupil, a suburb of Kanchipuram which is the birthplace of Vedanta Desika is not too far from Dusi. One of the most important festivals of this temple is celebrated on \\"full-moon day (Pournami) in the month of Chitirai (April‚ÄìMay)\\" when the processional deity (utsava murti) of Sri Varadaraja Swami from the famous temple in Kanchipuram visits Dusi and blesses every house in this place. This well-attended celebration attracts a multitude of devotees from Kanchipuram and surrounding villages. Among the visitors is the Jeeyar of Ahobila Math. Some of the other festivals celebrated in this temple are Ekadasi, Navaratri and Sankaranti. Between the villages of Dusi and Mamandur is one of the largest irrigation tanks in Tamil Nadu. Aptly called the Dusi-Mamandur tank, it has a water spread area of 13.5 km2 and a capacity to store 180 million cubic feet of water. This tank is believed to have been constructed in the seventh century A.D. in the reign of the famous Mahendravarman I. The Vaikuntavasa Perumal temple must have once been not only a hub of religious activity but also a socio-economic and cultural centre like many other temples in this region. However, over the centuries it became dilapidated due to the vagaries of nature and neglect. It is due to the healthy interest and untiring efforts of the people in Dusi and members of families of this village now living elsewhere that this ancient temple has sprung back to life. Renovation includes a new shrine for Santhanavalli Thayar and kitchen (Madapalli). The consecration (samprokshanam) of the Vaikuntavasa Perumal temple was held on 24 March 2011.

It was proposed by the Tribunes of the Plebs, M. Plautius Silvanus and C. Papirius Carbo. The law granted Roman citizenship to Italian communities that had previously rebelled against Rome during this war.  Background  The Social War, which was fought between 91 and 88 BC, was a rebellion against Rome by some of her Italic socii (allies) caused by Rome's refusal to grant them Roman citizenship. However, this concession became necessary to try to stem the rebellion. The Lex Plautia Papiria was not the first law that extended Roman citizenship during the Social War. In 90 BC, the Lex Calpurnia gave commanders the power to reward valor of soldiers with Roman citizenship. In the same year, the Lex Julia de Civitate Latinis et Socii Danda granted civitas to Italian communities who had not participated in the rebellion against Rome to prevent them from joining the war. The law stated that communities with newly granted citizenship should be enrolled in new tribes for voting in the Comitia Tributa. In 89 BC the Lex Plautia Papiria followed the guidelines laid out in the Lex Julia for adding new tribes to the Comitia Tibuta for the new communities which were also granted citizenship. In the same year, the Lex Pompeia de Transpadanis granted Latin rights to the communities in Transpadana, the region north of the River Po as a reward for having sided with Rome during the war.Dart, C. J.,The Social War, 91 to 88 BC A History of the Italian Insurgency against the Roman Republic (2014), pp. 189-212  Provisions  While the complete original text of the law has never been recovered, Cicero stated several of the provisions of the law in his Pro Archia Poeta Oratio: Thus, an individual had to meet three conditions to become a Roman citizen under the newly created law: he must claim citizenship in an Italian city that was a Roman ally, he must have already established residence there before the passing of this law and he must then present himself to a praetor within sixty days to be considered for citizenship. Unlike the Lex Julia, which granted citizenship only to entire cities, the Lex Papiria Plautia could be used to grant citizenship to individuals as well.  Effects  Demonstrating its use in granting citizenship to an individual, the law was used as justification for bestowing citizenship upon Aulus Licinius Archias. Archias, a Greek poet, was accused of assuming his citizenship illegally. However, in Pro Archia, Cicero used, among other reasons, the Lex Plautia Papiria to uphold the legitimacy of Archias‚Äô citizenship. The law, however, was ineffective at persuading confederate towns and at ending the war. By placing the newly admitted citizens into new tribes instead of assimilating them into previously established tribes, the laws made the votes of the new citizens virtually worthless. Thus, Italian confederates had little incentive to stop fighting against Rome. Although it is also worth noting the significant benefits brought aside from suffrage (protection from mistreatment during military service, improved legal rights, and for the rich, chances to bid for lucrative tax farming contracts) which may for many have been most significant.

AppleWin originally required a minimum Intel 486 CPU and is written in C++. AppleWin has support for most programs that could run either on the Apple II+ or the Apple IIe. By default, AppleWin emulates the Extended Keyboard IIe (better known as the Platinum IIe) with built-in 80-column text support, 128 kilobytes of RAM, two 5¬º-inch floppy disk drives, a joystick, a serial card and 65C02 CPU. AppleWin supports lo-res, hi-res, and double hi-res graphics modes and can emulate both color and monochrome Apple II monitors; later versions of AppleWin also can emulate a television set used as a monitor. Both 40-column and 80-column text is supported. AppleWin can emulate the Apple II joystick (using the PC's default controller), paddle controllers (using the computer mouse), and can also emulate the Apple II joystick using the PC keyboard. AppleWin can also use the PC speaker to emulate the Apple II's sound if no sound card is available (does not work under NT-based Windows versions). Full screen mode is available through the use of DirectX. Features added to the latest versions of AppleWin include Ethernet support using Uthernet, Mockingboard and Phasor sound card support, SSI263 speech synthesis, hard drive disk images, save states, and taking screenshots. Supported disk images AppleWin supports ProDOS and DOS 3.3 disk image formats as well as copy-protected programs copied with \\"nibble copiers\\" to a disk image.

History Faridnagar was founded during the rule of the great mogul emperor Akbar by Nawab Farid-ud-din. He was awarded the \\"Zagir\\" of seventeen villages between Pilkhua and Begmabad by emperor Akbar the great. The town used to be a garrison for a small mugal military unit and housed the Taksal - a place to mint mugal coins during the reigns of Akbar and Jahangir. The major source of revenue were farming, gardening and trade. Important industries were cotton weaving and Khandsari-the gud making, oil extraction and pottery making. The decline of the town started in the early 1930s when the British constructed highways and built rail roads. All of them bypassed Faridnagar and Modinagar became the major industrial and educational center. Cotton industries shifted to Pilkhuwa.

He was mayor of Bogot√° from 1998 until 2001 and elected again in 2015 for the 2016‚Äì2019 term. He has also worked as a journalist and consultant on urban and transportation policy. In 2009, Pe√±alosa was elected president of the board of directors of the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP), a non-profit organization headquartered in New York. Pe√±alosa resigned from the ITDP board in 2015 upon his election. Early life and education Pe√±alosa was born in Washington, DC to Cecilia Londo√±o and Enrique Pe√±alosa Camargo, former Minister of Agriculture at the UN and permanent ambassador for Colombia to the UN. During his childhood, Pe√±alosa studied at Gimnasio Campestre and the Colegio Refous. His family moved to the United States when he was 15 years old for his father's work as the ambassador of Colombia to the UN. He attended Duke University through a partial football scholarship, where he earned a bachelor of arts in Economics and History. Entry into politics Pe√±alosa began his political life by attending the liberal presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan's Youth groups of followers in Bogot√° while working for the state-owned water supply company, Empresa de Acueducto de Bogot√° (EAAB). He later supported Julio C√©sar S√°nchez, a Cundinamarca local political chief, who in return, helped him get elected as that department's Deputy. He was later chosen by president Virgilio Barco, a friend of his father, as an economic advisor in 1986. In 1990, he ran for the congressman without the support of any politician and got elected with 22,000 votes. He only remained in that position for a year because the Colombian Congress was closed in the eve of the new Colombian Constitution. However, in those 12 months, he presented many initiatives and managed to pass a reform law, notable for a first-timer congressman. In 1991, he decided to run for mayor of Bogot√° with the same tactics he used to gain his seat for Congress, without the support of any politicians and just by doing face-to-face contact while touring the city walking, biking or riding on public transportation. He ran against Jaime Castro Castro who ultimately won the election. In 1994, he ran for a second time against Antanas Mockus, who defeated him by a large margin. Mayor of Bogot√° (1998-2000) In 1997, he ran a third time, now facing Carlos Moreno de Caro winning by a close margin of votes. Pe√±alosa received from Mayor Mockus a city in good fiscal condition and with a District Council that was mostly independent. Pe√±alosa included many of his political friends in his cabinet including long time friend Carlos Alberto Sandoval, who had worked with him in Barco's presidency, who he appointed as Secretary of Economy, and Gilma Jim√©nez in the Family Welfare Institute. Enrique's brother, Gil Pe√±alosa, became Commissioner of Parks. During his mayorship he developed five megaprojects: the bank of lands, the District's system of Parks (including the Bogot√°'s Bike Paths Network), the District's system of libraries, the Transmilenio mass transit system, and road construction and maintenance. The impact of Pe√±alosa and Antanas Mockus on the development of Bogot√° is described in a documentary film released in October 2009 with the title Bogot√° Change. It is promoted as being \\"the story of two charismatic mayors, Antanas Mockus and Enrique Pe√±alosa who, with unorthodox methods, in less than 10 years turned one of the world's most dangerous, violent and corrupt capitals into a model city. Mockus and Pe√±alosa along with key members of their staff as first hand witnesses, the film uncovers the ideas, philosophies and strategies that underlie the changes in Bogot√° and which are now being exported to cities worldwide\\". Throughout the first half of his time as mayor, Pe√±alosa underwent very low approval ratings, even surviving a recall election process mid-term. As public infrastructure projects started to progress, his popularity increased very significantly, such that by the end of his term his approval ratings were some of the highest of any Bogot√° mayor in recorded history. =Controversy during his first term= According to most public analysts in Colombia, Pe√±alosa was the third in a series of three mayors who significantly improved the public conditions in the city of Bogot√° in the late 1990s. Mayor Jaime Castro finished his term with low popularity, but was able to reform the city's financial structures. This led to a period of budgetary surpluses, which continued during Antanas Mockus term. Mockus began an important change in Bogot√°'s civic culture with his Cultura Ciudadana (Citizen Culture) campaign, which encouraged civic behavior and strived to create a sense of belonging for the inhabitants of the city. Pe√±alosa's six biggest policy actions during his first period as mayor included the relocation of informal vendors who occupied the public zones and streets, the improvement of all the city parks and the construction of several new ones, the construction of major public libraries and large public schools in the poorest areas in the city, the renovation of important avenues such as the 15th Avenue and Autopista Norte, the removal of cars from sidewalks by raising them and installing bollards, and starting construction of the first Mass Transit System in Bogot√°, the heavy BRT called TransMilenio, whose construction started under Pe√±alosa to be finished under Antanas Mockus's second term (2001-2003). Some of his policies were unpopular with certain political groups within the city. Among these were his intent to buy the Country Club of Bogot√° to build a public park, which brought him in conflict with some of the wealthiest neighborhoods in Northern Bogot√°. He also faced problems when he installed bollards along some avenues in highly congested sectors to prevent cars from parking on the sidewalk in front of the buildings and shops. Pe√±alosa also lost popularity, but improved the city's mobility, by introducing the Pico y Placa, a restriction on the rush hour circulation of private vehicles. (Pico y placa roughly translates to \\"rush hour and license plate\\"; during rush hour licence plates ending with a given number couldn't circulate on a specific days of the week, four ending numbers each day, thus about 40% of the vehicles). The construction of the city's first \\"Cicloruta\\" (translation for \\"Bike route or Bike way\\") which are two-way roads that run along some of the city's main avenues, was another great development of the city as an invitation for people to avoid using private motor vehicles, and to provide a cheap and healthy transportation route for those who didn't have access to one. Their construction brought some controversy at first, as the Cicloruta's corridors crossed in front of private houses were in the majority of the cases space was taken from their front sidewalk without their consent and with no remuneration. The legal property documents weren't edited either, which meant that whoever owned the house in front of the sidewalk where the Cicloruta was built, was its actual owner and had to pay taxes on it. For his activities in promoting public transportation, bike use and public space in urban areas in his first term in office, Pe√±alosa was awarded several international sustainability and urban planning awards, and was selected as a distinguished guest in urban policy studies at NYU. Enrique Pe√±alosa Londo√±o at the 2009 Sustainable Transport Awards =Candidate for a second term as Mayor= Although he was a possible candidate for the 2010 Colombian presidential election and led the Por el Pais que Queremos Foundation (PPQ), Spanish for \\"For the Country we Want\\", he chose to run again for mayor in 2007. He was defeated by Alternative Democratic Pole candidate Samuel Moreno by 15 percentage points. In 2011, Pe√±alosa decided to run his candidacy again for the Bogot√° city hall, but this time, as the official candidate for the Colombian Green Party. He lost the election to Gustavo Petro who won the mayoral race with 32% of the vote against 25% for Pe√±alosa. In 2015 he won the mayoral elections with 33 percent of the vote, defeating former labour minister Rafael Pardo Rueda. =Presidential candidate= Pe√±alosa ran for elections in the 2014 presidential election. He represented the Green Party and his Vice Presidential candidate was Isabel Segovia a former Vice Minister of Education. Mayor of Bogot√° (2016-2019) Enrique Pe√±alosa was elected mayor of Bogot√° a second time in October 25, 2015, where he won with 906.052 votes and 33.1 percent of the electorate. Even before taking office for his 2016‚Äì2019 term, Pe√±alosa was subject to low approval ratings similar to those in the first half of his first term as mayor. In 2015 and onwards, politics in Bogot√° was deeply polarized between Pe√±alosa's center-right policies and leftist populist policies, represented by former mayor Gustavo Petro. Pe√±alosa was the first center-right candidate to be elected as mayor after 12 years of leftist populist politicians in office, with Luis Eduardo Garzon (2004‚Äì2007), Samuel Moreno Rojas (2008‚Äì2011) and Gustavo Petro (2012‚Äì2015). His principal policy proposals in his second administration include the construction of Bogota's first Rapid transit line, to be complemented by several new BRT corridors following Transmilenio's early 2000 plan - including in landmark avenues such as 7th, 68th and Boyac√° Avenues, the construction of 30 public schools and 6 public hospitals, the implementation of 1.500 surveillance cameras to prevent petty crime, the construction of large highways and avenues such as Avenida Longitudinal de Occidente and Tintal-Alsacia-Constituci√≥n, selling all public participation in Empresa de Telefonos de Bogot√° (ETB), and the expansion of Bogot√°'s metropolitan area in its northern edges, in areas currently occupied by the Thomas Van Der Hammen natural reserve. Pe√±alosa has been in controversy with several interest groups for these proposals -specifically environmental, education, and health citizen groups, as well as his political opponents from leftist groups strong in the city. As of late 2017, a recall election attempt on Pe√±alosa is being spearheaded by ETB's unions (who oppose privatization) and Gustavo Petro's political group, supported by other citizen groups. On October 27, 2019, Claudia L√≥pez Hern√°ndez, a member of the Green Alliance Party, was elected to succeed Pe√±alosa as mayor of Bogot√°.https://www.losangelesblade.com/2019/10/28/lesbian-elected-mayor-of- colombian-capital/ https://thecitypaperbogota.com/news/claudia-lopez-elected- mayor-of-bogota-and-first-woman-to-govern-colombias-capital/23027 Democratic Center candidate Miguel Uribe Turbay, who served Pe√±alosa's Secretary-General, came in fourth place during the election.https://thecitypaperbogota.com/news/claudia-lopez-elected-mayor-of- bogota-and-first-woman-to-govern-colombias-capital/23027 =Graduate degrees scandal= Penalosa's critics have recently claimed that he has repeatedly misstated his professional graduate studies throughout his career. Pe√±alosa claims he earned a Dipl√¥me d'√©tudes sup√©rieures sp√©cialis√©es (DESS) at the University of Paris. In response to these allegations, he has claimed that this DESS title has been repeatedly misinterpreted as a PhD. Further investigation into his studies revealed that he earned a graduate degree in Government Affairs at the University of Paris II, and later earning a DESS at the Institut international d‚Äôadministration publique (also known as √âcole nationale de la France d'outre-mer), which in 2002 was merged into √âcole nationale d'administration. The scandal was triggered in 2016 by an opinion article published in the Colombian newspaper El Espectador, which reported in April 2016 that Pe√±alosa did not hold a doctoral degree as had been widely reported by several sources, including in the personal profile section in several of his published books. Opinion writers in El Espectador discovered that Pe√±alosa did not hold a doctoral degree, after contacting the University of Paris which confirmed that it did not offer any academic program that would grant a PhD in Public Administration. The magazine Semana also reported that during the swearing-in ceremony of the Mayor on January 2016, a leaflet had been circulated among news media that presented Pe√±alosa as a PhD of Public Administration, which the mayor dismissed as typing errors by someone in his team. According to an opposition group actively promoting Pe√±alosa's 2015 election to be recalled, Pe√±alosa has been misrepresenting his graduate degrees for 35 years. The group denounced that in an interview with the Brazilian newspaper O Globo, Pe√±alosa had directly stated that he held a PhD in public administration, however only the edited interview was ever published, and given the differences between the Spanish and Portuguese languages, other proof of this statement remained unverified, including a direct statement from the lead reporter of said interview. Pe√±alosa himself has repeatedly claimed that he has never mentioned in public that he has a PhD degree, and that he firmly believes that his two graduate degrees earned in France are equivalent to master's degrees in the Colombian education system, while stating that his political opponents are actively trying to tarnish his academic credentials with unsubstantiated attacks while promoting his election to be recalled. In his first term as mayor, Pe√±alosa also went through a significant Recall election attempt by his political opponents. According to Pe√±alosa's official public curriculum vitae presented to Colombian authorities when elected as mayor, Pe√±alosa holds a bachelor's degree in Economics and History (Earned in May, 1977), a Master's in Government Affairs (Earned in September, 1979) and a \\"third cycle graduate title in Public Management\\", referring to the DESS title (Earned in September, 1980).

It is one of the nine administrative blocks of Gurugram district situated from Gurugram and shares its border with Jhajjar district. It is part of the Ahirwal region. Established in 1732 by Faujdar Khan, the first Nawab of Farrukhnagar and a governor of the Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar, Farrukhnagar flourished due to its salt trade until the late 19th century, and was abandoned in the early 20th century, during the British Raj. Today, Mughal era monuments such as Sheesh Mahal, Baoli and Jama Masjid built by Faujdar Khan are popular visitor attractions. The town is connected to Garhi Harsaru, south of Gurugram, by the railway line. The Sultanpur National Park is situated in Farrukhnagar block on Gurugram Road. Pataudi Palace, from the town, is the nearest palace.  History  The area was controlled by Baloch rulers until the arrival of Faujdar Khan. = Mughal era = Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar (r. 1713‚Äì1719) after whom the Farrukhnagar was named, by his governor shantanu marwari who founded the city in 1732. Founded by Faujdar Khan, the first Nawab of Farrukhnagar and a governor of the Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar, in 1732, Farrukhnagar flourished due to its salt trade Khan built the fort surrounding the octagonal town, with five gated entrances, his palace known as Sheesh Mahal, a notable structure in Mughal architecture around 1761, also the Jama Masjid and Dilli Darwaza (Delhi Gate). The successive Nawabs ruled over a large tract of land in the area, for over 70 years until they were overthrown by the Jat ruler of Bharatpur.

During the rebellion their combined forces took over Rohtak completely from British forces for a while, and attacked and plundered the civil station, burning all official records. After the Rebellion failed, forces of Punjab levies moved in and Raja Nahar Singh of Bahadurgarh and Nawab Abdur Rehman Khan of Jhajjar were captured and tried, while the former was executed in Delhi, the latter escaped with a sentence of exile to Lahore. A memorial was recently raised to commemorate the martyrs of the rebellion in the city. For their participation in 1857 rebellion, three main chiefs of Haryana were tried and hanged at Kotwali in Chandani Chowk of Old Delhi. Nahar Singh, the Raja of Ballabhgarh, was hanged on 9 January 1958. Abdur Rehman, Nawab of Jhajjar, was hanged on 23 January 1858. Ahmad Ali, Nawab of Farrukhnagar, was hanged on 23 January 1858. The Chaudharys and Lambardars of villages who participated in rebellion were also deprived of their land and property, including 368 people of Hisar and Gurugram were hanged or transported for life, and fine was imposed on the people of Thanesar (Rs 2,35,000), Ambala (Rs. 25, 3541) and Rohtak (Rs. 63,000 mostly on Ranghars, Shaikhs and Muslim Kasai).Satish Chandra Mittal, 1986, Haryana, a Historical Perspective, p58.  Economy  The restored Baoli Ghaus Ali Shah, a stepwell in Farrukhnagar. The town was once an important trading center for salt manufactured from saline water obtained from wells of 12 village estates located near the town. This salt was called Sultanpur Salt after the location of the most important salt-works of the region. Sultanpur was the centre of salt production for use in Delhi and the United Provinces until the late 19th century, exporting annually 680,000 maunds or 18,350 tons (1 maund = 37 kg approx.) over the Rajputana-Malwa Railway. Salt was produced by extracting brine from about 40 wells using bullocks and drying in open plots. Since salt was one of the major sources of government's revenue, the office of the Salt Superintendent at Sultanpur supervised the levy of Rs. 2 per maund (about 37 kg). With the levy of the heavy salt tax and acquisition of the Sambhar salt works in Rajputana (present Rajasthan) by the government, the Sultanpur salt became uneconomical and by 1903-04 the salt industry was struggling for survival with salt export having fallen to 65,000 maunds or 1,750 tons leading to severe setback to the economy of Sultanpur area. Finally, in 1923 the British shut down the office of the salt superintendent at Sultanpur, had all the mounds of salt thrown back into the wells and shut down the salt industry leading to considerable economic misery to the people.  Post independence  Farrukhnagar became a municipality in 1967. Efforts to revive the salt mining by the government failed, after a massive flood in the 1970s watered down the saline level in the wells. The area saw steep rise in land prices starting from the 1990s onwards due to rapid urbanisation and industrialisation in the Gurgaon district, as a result small section large landowners amassed great wealth in short period, which also encouraged public splurging. In 2007, the town made news in the global media, when a local jat farmer hired a private helicopter to ferry his son to his wedding, barely 20 km away. In the recent years, heritage structures in the town have attracted interest from various organisations including ASI and INTACH, which is proposing a \\"heritage walk\\" around town, and also plans to develop it as a heritage village.

Two slabs of red sandstone on the southern wall bear Arabic inscriptions dating to the period of Sultan of Delhi, Ghiyas ud din Balban (1200‚Äì1287). The slabs are stated to have been brought from an ancient mosque in Sultanpur about 5 kilometres away in the direction of Delhi. * Sheesh Mahal: The palace of the Nawab of Farrukhnagar aligns the main bazaar of the town as do many other heritage structures in the town. Built by Faujdar Khan in 1711 CE, it is a double-storey structure in red sandstone, Mughal bricks and Jhajjar stone, used commonly in the buildings of the period in the district. It has decorative interiors of elaborate mirror inlay work, hence its name, Sheesh Mahal (Glass Palace). It's baradari, literally a pavilion with 12 doorways, now houses Municipal committee office, once housed a school. The palace opens on to a large courtyard with water channel in the centre, it was fed by a nearby baoli or stepwell, it is also believed that in olden days, the queen used to visit the baoli for taking bath from Sheesh Mahal through a tunnel, which has since been closed. The palace is being restored by the archaeological department and its premises also has a memorial dedicated to the martyrs of Indian Rebellion of 1857 from the town. * Sethani Ki Chhatri: An elaborate memorial cenotaph in the shape of a two-storeyed chhatri, which is a pillar pavilion is situated on the Jhajjar road at the entrance to the town. It has eight arched openings on each floor and floral decorative motifs are used profusely. Chhatri though typical to Rajasthani architecture, it was later adapted into Mughal architecture. The name suggests that it belonged to a merchants wife, and is decorated with inscriptions and frescoes from Haroti region in Rajasthan. An inscription within the ceiling frescoes dates it to Vikram Samvat 1918, i.e. 1861 AD. * Sita-Ram Mandir: The temple is dedicated to Hindu Gods, Rama-Sita, and also serves the purpose of Gurdwara, though the structure with its three domes, resembles a mosque.Gurugram heritage, fridaygurgaon.com. * Havelis: A set of old havelis in the main town are in good condition, and boast of frescoes, and post-Mughal architectural features. * Shrine of Budho Mata: The nearby village Mubarakpur 5 km from Farrukhnagar, is famous for this shrine, where a fair is held every Wednesday. * Baoli Ghaus Ali Shah: A 3-story large octagonal Baoli stepwell, also known as Ali Gosh Khan Baoli, with stone staircases is considered a monument of importance and has been restored after it was taken over by ASI.

The site was also known by other names, such as Hwangudan (ÌôòÍµ¨Îã®, ), Jecheondan (Ï†úÏ≤úÎã®, ) and Wondan (ÏõêÎã®, ).Cyber Tour into Cultutural Properties Wongudan was designated South Korea's Historic Site No. 157 on July 15, 1967. History The Rite of Heaven was performed during the pre-Three Kingdoms period. During the Goryeo Dynasty, King Seongjong was the first of the Goryeo kings to perform the rite, designed to ensure a bountiful harvest. King Seongjong standardized the Wonguje rituals. During the Goryeo Dynasty, the practice was abolished. King Sejo of Joseon briefly restarted the rite but stopped the practice in the tenth year of his reign in 1464 because the rite could only be performed by the son of heaven - the Ming emperor and Joseon was a tributary state to Ming. The ritual was restarted again when King Gojong proclaimed the Korean Empire in 1897 after the First Sino-Japanese War, but it was subsequently abolished by the Japanese colonial government in 1910. The Gocheonje ritual was revived in 2002 with the intention of annual performance as a revival of Korean cultural heritage. Architecture The altar complex before destruction Wongudan was built in 1897 following the Ming ritual tradition. The site of the complex sat between Namsan and Bukhansan, and was considered highly auspicious by geomancers. The altar complex was also designed to mimic natural elements such as the sun and moon. It was a three-story altar made of granite and was used for animal sacrifice. The top center of the altar held a conical yellow-roofed building. The altar was destroyed by the Japanese in 1913. Hwanggungu Today, the Hwanggungu (hwang-gung-u, ÁöáÁ©πÂÆá, Imperial Vault of Heaven), a three-storied octagonal shrine built in 1899, remains at the site. The Hwanggungu, built on the north side of the altar complex, was designed for the worship of Heaven and respecting Taejo, the founder of Joseon. Along with the Hwanggungu, there are several other surviving relics such as the three stone drums (Seokgodan, Áü≥ÈºìÂ£á) featuring dragon decorations completed in 1902 to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Gojong's enthronement, the gate leading to Hwanggungu, and the main entrance into the complex. The imperial Japanese built the Railroad Chosen Hotel in the area where they had demolished Wongudan Altar. In 1968, that hotel was demolished and the Westin Chosun Hotel was built in its place. The Hwanggungu still stands in the hotel complex today and although it is not a well known tourist site, it is popular with the guests of the hotel.

After his win, he named the area as Fatehgarh, but because the area was called Churianvala, the area slowly became known as Fatehgarh Churian. Fatehgarh Churian became the headquarters of Haqiqat Singh. Haqiqat Singh Kanhaiya Sandhu further united Kotli Soorat Malhi, Kalanur, Taragarh, Narot Jaimal Singh and many villages under his territory. Fatehgarh Churian became the capital of his kingdom, and became very prosperous under his policies. To form an alliance with the Phulkian Misl, Haqiqat Singh married his son Jaimal Singh Kanhaiya to Sahib Kaur, daughter of Raja Amar Singh of Patiala. In 1782, Haqiqat Singh Kanhaiya died, and control was passed down to his son Jaimal Singh Kanhaiya. Kharak Singh, son of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, was married to Chand Kaur, daughter of Sardar Jaimal Singh Kanhaiya in this town. Sardar Jaimal Singh Kanhaiya built a temple called Panj Mandir with a Pucca tank, which still stands. The 180-year-old temple carries the legacy of Punjab in the form of unique frescoes adorning monuments that, due to the neglect of the authorities, is losing its former glory. After the visit of two-member ASI teams in 2011 and a sanction of 3 crores for restoration, it is still awaiting action. Ten acres of land were donated to Panj Mandir by Jaimal Singh Kanhaiya Sandhu during the marriage of his daughter Chand Kaur to Kharak Singh. The marriage was celebrated throughout Punjab, and Fatehgarh Churian became the center of attraction. For the convenience of Maharaja Ranjit Singh's guests, Jaimal Singh Kanhaiya built a huge pond and 12 darhi. Later on, his son Chanda Singh Kanhaiya, on the request of his Purohit, built a temple near this pond and 12 darhi, which is today known as Talab Wala Mandir. A samadh of Rani Chand Kaur was built inside the Panj Mandir after her death. Gagranwala Mandir is the most popular temple in Fatehgarh Churian. It was constructed by Chanda Singh Kanhaiya, on his land, for the local Hindu population. The temple is famous for its Golden Gagrans, donated by Chanda Singh Kanhaiya. After the Second Anglo-Sikh War, most of the estates of Chanda Singh Kanhaiya were captured by the British, because Chanda Singh Kanhaiya hadn't sided with the British. After Fatehgarh Churian was included in the British territory, Diwans of Kanhaiya Misl pledged allegiance to the British Crown. This broke the relationship between Diwans and Kanhaiyas, and most of the estates of Chanda Singh Kanhaiya were granted to Diwans by the British. Diwan Dilbag Rai, among the Diwans, was made honorary magistrate of Fatehgarh Churian by the British in the early 20th century, and represented the local populace. The family of Kanhaiyas still lives on the old fort land of Fatehgarh Churian. Before 1947, the town had a majority Muslim population that included Shias and Sunnis. The Sunni and Shia Muslims were roughly equal in numbers. After the partition of India, several Hindu and Sikh migrants from newly-formed Pakistan settled in Fatehgarh Churian. Mohinder Singh Kanhaiya and his brothers provided safe passage to Muslims going to newly-formed Pakistan. The kindness of Mohinder Singh Kanhaiya spread to Muslims of nearby areas, and many of them travelled to Fatehgarh Churian and were sheltered in the old fort, and were later helped by the Sardars to reach Pakistan safely. There was not a single incident of violence around Fatehgarh Churian during Partition. The refugees from Pakistan were helped by Mohinder Singh Kanhaiya to setup their homes, and much land was donated by him to the poor people. Some mosques were converted to Gurudwaras after Partition. Description Fatehgarh Churian is situated on the boundary between Gurdaspur and Amritsar districts. It is the last village in Gurdaspur district, and is closer to Amritsar than to Gurdaspur. It is well-connected to other towns by the road network and is surrounded by Amritsar (), Batala (), Ajnala (), and Dera Baba Nanak (). It is on the railway line between Amritsar and Dera Baba Nanak. Fatehgarh Churian is divided into thirteen different wards. Notable places Religious places in Fatehgarh Churian are Gagranwala Mandir, Tahli Sahib Gurudwara, Panj Mandir, Githi Das Mandir, Talab Wala Mandir, Gurudwara Takhia Wala, and many churches. St. Francis Convent School is one of the biggest institutions this town has for quality education. In addition to these, Puran Shah's Haveli is another landmark of the town.

Approximately 99% of each graduating class pursues a higher education at a college, university or military service academy. In the Class of 2014, students received almost $12.7 million in scholarship offers. St. Mary's Ryken provides education for almost 700 students in grades 9-12 and is the only Catholic high school affiliated with the Archdiocese of Washington in the three Southern Maryland counties. Students come from St. Mary's, Calvert, Charles and southern Prince George's counties. The school colors are blue, green and white, and the official mascot is the knight. History St. Mary's Ryken was established in 1981 and traces its roots in Catholic education to St. Mary's Academy (est. 1885) and Ryken High School (est. 1956). The Sisters of Charity of Nazareth opened St. Mary's Academy (SMA) in 1885 on the grounds of the property known as Rose Hill in Leonardtown. Mrs. Richard H. Miles bequeathed the property to Father Charles Jenkins, S.J., with the intent that it be used by \\"a religious order to conduct a Catholic school.\\" SMA grew rapidly as a coeducational boarding school and accepted students from kindergarten through twelfth grade. The burgeoning population of St. Mary's County and Southern Maryland soon rendered the academy too small and a new school building was erected in 1936. In 1956, the school expanded yet again with a dormitory, convent and chapel. With the opening of the new, all boys Ryken High School, the sisters carried on their selfless dedication as a school for young women. In 1916, to their good fortune, the Xaverian Brothers purchased over one hundred acres along Breton Bay from Mr. Enoch Abell and opened a camp for boys known as Camp Calvert. Young men flocked from the cities to spend a few weeks of their summer vacations there. The brothers' vision for this property was to eventually build a school and novitiate for boys and, in 1956, their dream became reality with the opening of Ryken High School (RHS). The school, named after Theodore James Ryken, founder of the Xaverian order, served as a juniorate for those with vocations to the Xaverian Brothers as well as a high school for young men. Eventually, with a diminishing number of boarders and vocational candidates, both SMA and RHS closed their dormitories and operated solely as Catholic high schools. SMA and RHS supported each other through sports programs, theater and music productions, dances, proms and academic instruction. By the late 1970s, both schools experienced declining enrollments and agreed to merge into one coeducational Catholic high school. In 2009, St. Mary's Ryken embarked on the first significant reshaping of its campus in almost 30 years. Phase 1 of the Strategic Master Plan was put into action with the groundbreaking for the SMR Athletic Complex. In this year, all of Paschal Hall was air conditioned and an annex was added that includes an office for the Athletics Director and a new boys' team and locker room. A 340-space parking lot was built on the grounds of the old student parking lot and the field and track behind Paschal Hall. Construction of the new 1,000-seat stadium with pressbox, artificial turf field and six-lane track was completed in August 2010.

In 2011, it was made the headquarter of the newly created Fazilka district. The Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline (TAPI) project originating in Turkmenistan will have its last station in Fazilka.  History  The municipality of Fazilka was formed with Punjab Government Notification No. 486, on 10 December 1885. The town was added to the Ferozepur district in 1884. On 27 July 2011, Fazilka was declared a District by the Government of Punjab with Gazette Notification No. 1/1/2011-RE-II(I)/14554. Fazilka, like many towns on the Indo-Pakistani border, has suffered difficulties dating back to the Partition of India in 1947. The Radcliffe Line, the border recommended by departing British colonial authorities, divides natural resources, houses, and people. The Satluj River, which is a common source of water, is a border between the two countries. Before partition, 50% of Fazilka's population was Muslim. All of them left India for Pakistan in 1947. Most of the villages around Fazilka were dominated by Muslim families, mainly the Bodla, Watto, Sahoo Rajpoot, Kalya Rajpoot and Chistis clans. Many people from Fazilka pay an annual visit to Katasraj ‚Äî a Hindu holy city in Pakistan ‚Äî usually in August.  Demographics and geography  As of the 2011 Indian census, Fazilka had a population of 76,492. Males constitute about 52% of the population and females 48%. Fazilka has an average literacy rate of 70.7%: male literacy is 74.6%, and female literacy is 66.4%. 11% of the population is under 6 years of age.  Languages  Punjabi is language of Fazilka. Punjabi is spoken by a most people followed by Hindi, English with some Punjabi accent.  Regional dance  Fazilka is known for a style of jhumar dance promulgated by Baba Pokhar Singh (1916‚Äì2002). Pokhar Singh's family had migrated from the Montgomery District of Western Punjab, and they claimed to represent the Ravi style of jhumar. However, Fazilka had its own style of jhumar which was referred to as the Satluj style. Therefore, at least two regional styles were mixed in everyday life, and in his jhummar routine (which was basically the same each time, and which family and friends still perform today), Pokhar identified several other regional movements.Dr. Nahar Singh (1988). Panjaabi Lok-Naach: Sabhiaachaarak Bhoomika te Saarthakta [\\"Punjabi Folk-Dance: Cultural Role and Significance\\"], Lokgit Prakashan. Translated, with editorial remarks, by Gibb Schreffler (2003)  Climate  The climate of the Fazilka District is, on the whole, dry and is characterized by a very hot summer, a short rainy season, and a bracing winter. The year may be divided into four seasons. The cold season is from November to March. This is followed by the summer season which lasts until about the end of June. The period from July to mid-September constitutes the south-westerly monsoon season. The latter half of September and October may be termed the post- monsoon or the transition period.  Transport  = Railway = The first railway line through the town was set up in 1898 on the occasion of the Diamond Jubilee of the ascension to the throne by Queen Victoria. Fazilka was connected by railway to McLeod Ganj (now in PakMandi Sadiqganj) on the route to Bahawalnagar and then to Bahawalpur. Fazilka was connected by railway to Amruka (now in Pakistan) through Chaanwala. The tracks from Fazilka to McLeod Ganj and from Fazilka to Chaanwala are now closed, perhaps removed. Fazilka Junction railway station is connected to Ferozepur and Bathinda junctions of Northern Railways. A new 43 km long railway line to Abohar towards the south has been constructed to shorten the distance to Bikaner by over 100 km. Trains on the new railway line to Abohar began running in July 2012. An express train started between Sri Ganganagar and Firozpur via Abohar and Fazilka in November 2012 on this track. = Roads = National Highway 7 passes through Fazilka. NH 7 connects to NH 9 at Malaut which leads to Delhi via Hissar and Rohtak. The state highway runs from Fazilka to Ferozepur and from Fazilka to Malout. Both are good roads. = Air = Amritsar international airport and Bathinda domestic airport are the nearest, about 90 km away. = Intra-city-Ecocabs = Fazilka have a public bus transport system. Cycle rickshaws are the available means of transport in the city. These rickshaws are now dispatched by Fazilka Centre.

The head of a marble statue found on the Acropolis so much resembles the copies of one of the Tyrannicides-- Harmodius-- that it has been called the Kritios Boy (now in the Acropolis Museum).

Creation The trilliant cut was introduced by the Asscher brothers in Amsterdam and was later trademarked by the Henry Meyer Diamond Company of New York in 1962. Now that the patent has expired, the term \\"Trilliant Cut\\" is used to refer to all triangular shaped gems, even step cut and cabochon stones. Triangular Brilliant and Triangular Modified Brilliant are the common terms used by GIA when referring to non-branded diamonds.  Uncurved  The cut displays a very sharp brilliance or fire if the diamond is cut to the correct depth allowing good scintillation. It is generally cut with a 1:1 length to width ratio with uncurved edges. This uncurved trilliant cut is usually used for accent gemstones, on either side of a main, larger stone of a ring.  Curved  This is a softer version of the uncurved version, with three soft points and curved sides. The length to width ratio should still be 1:1, keeping the gemstone proportioned.

He departed in 1993, and has been appearing regularly again since April 1997. During a 2011 interview LeBlanc said everyday \\"you have this incredible challenge, which, as an actor, that‚Äôs what I find, that‚Äôs what keeps it interesting. Michael Baldwin is not me. Every day I have to say ‚ÄòThis is a character I created,‚Äô and I have to find him again every day and commit every day, 12 months a year.\\" In April 2005, the character of Michael briefly crossed over to another CBS soap opera, As the World Turns.As the World Turns recap (April 4 and 5, 2005) - Soapcentral.com He served as Keith Morrissey's (Kin Shriner) attorney. LeBlanc has won Daytime Emmy Awards for his portrayal of the role in 2005, 2007, and 2009; all for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. Character development  =Characterization= Christian LeBlanc enjoys Michael's courtroom scenes, describing them as his \\"best moments\\". On-Air On-Soaps described Michael as a \\"quirky legal eye\\" whose \\"past and family put the ‚ÄúD‚Äù in dysfunctional\\". Michael is a prominent lawyer in Genoa City and a partner at Baldwin, Blair and Associates. He is the son of River Baldwin (Michael Gross) and Gloria Bardwell (Judith Chapman), and the half brother of Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart) and Eden Baldwin (Jessica Heap). He's currently married to Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman), with whom he has a son, Fenmore Baldwin. LeBlanc enjoys playing out scenes in the court room. Describing them as his \\"best moments\\", he stated: \\"I am the only one who loves court. I will swear to you now, I am the only one off set that lights up when there is a five page monologue. I have to tell you it was my first months on the show, and they gave me my first case, and it was about a black student who was suing the school system. I gave a speech, and I am telling you they had 12 on the jury and those extra‚Äôs cried, and that is all I cared about. That was like doing theatre.\\" In 2008, Michael's rough upbringing was visited. Michael Gross was introduced to the series as his father River Baldwin, a man Michael \\"thinks is a low-life, reprobate. A guy who refused to go to Vietnam and left Gloria to raise their son alone.\\" LeBlanc thought it was a \\"great story\\", although it took a while to come to fruition. LeBlanc said that Michael's yearning to find his birth father stemmed from having his own son, Fen, explaining: \\"I think it all started when he had Fen. It keys it off for a lot of fathers. This is a man who went to prison. He went to therapy to change his dark ways. He was a violent man and he claimed he never had a family. Then his family shows up and then you find out why he denied his family for so long.\\" Speaking of whether or not Michael could shift back to his \\"dark side\\", he said \\"I don‚Äôt know if it will be his downfall or not, because Lowell is such an unexpected character, and it certainly pushes all those buttons again\\". = Relationships and family= LeBlanc admires the friendship between Michael and Phyllis Summers played by Michelle Stafford, who he says is a \\"phenomenal actress\\". They were once involved romantically. LeBlanc explained that: \\"people are drawn to it. You know Michael and Phyllis were lovers once! You have this great relationship between two ex-lovers, and they are a man and woman. I don‚Äôt think you usually see that dynamic as much on other soaps.\\" Michael and Lauren have been described as one of the show's \\"most enduring couples\\". LeBlanc said \\"If it weren't for Lauren, Michael would have been off the deep end long before this.\\" He further told TV Guide about the pairing, \\"What's great about Lauren and Michael is that these are people who are not saints, who were adults when they met and have pasts they are not proud of. And they found each other.\\" In 2010, speaking of what he wanted his son Fenmore to be like, LeBlanc said \\"I want Fenmore to be different. I want him to be a smart-ass because I play him that way. He would be Michael back to me, you know how children sometimes are, like little Michael and big Michael‚Ä¶ really smart and verbal, which he is.\\" In fact, two years later, Fen was aged to fifteen years old and Max Ehrich stepped into the role. Fen became \\"a chip off the old block\\", turning into a rebellious teen with attitude. Storylines =1991‚Äì93= In 1991, Christine Blair went to work at a prestigious law firm, for hotshot lawyer Michael Baldwin. The charming Baldwin took her under his wing, guiding and training her. At first, Christine was appreciative until he kissed her one-day after a court victory. When Michael suggested a more friendly relationship in exchange for her moving up in the hierarchy, she began making inquiries at the firm about sexual harassment. Her promotion disappeared, and Chris filed a sexual harassment lawsuit. Christine also learned that Michael had done the same to several other women, including her neighbor Hilary Lancaster. To make himself look better, Michael wooed and married his old flame Hilary, but he still had his eye on Christine. When she and Danny Romalotti broke up, he asked her to accompany him on a business trip to Los Angeles. Once there, Michael made sexual advances. Chris (whose breakup with Danny was staged) caught his behavior on audio tape, he was fired, and Hilary left him. Michael quickly got a job at another prestigious firm, but Christine went to their disciplinary committee, who agreed to hear a case against him. Michael wasn't going to go down without a fight. He claimed Chris had entrapped him by continuing to work at the firm after leaving his employ. He paid a woman named Rebecca to drug Danny's tea and get photos of her and Danny appearing to be having sex to show that Danny and Christine's marriage wasn't as happy as they claimed. Rebecca threatened to blackmail Michael, and he strangled her. Michael was never charged with this crime as he was never linked to it. Michael was found guilty of sexual harassment, lost his job, Hilary divorced him, and left town, never to be heard of again. Michael apologized to Christine, announcing his plans to leave town, but his real plans were much more sinister. While Danny was out of town performing, Michael bluffed his way into Hilary's empty apartment and got into Christine's apartment by frantically digging a hole in the wall where he hid in the closet, waiting to attack her. Fortunately when he made his move, Paul Williams raced in, and caught him on top of Christine in her bed. Michael turned, tried to shoot Paul and missed. Paul shot Michael, and he fell limp and bloody, pinning Christine to the bed. Michael was sent to prison, and even though he claimed insanity, stayed there for four years. =1997‚Äî= Michael, now forced to work as a paralegal due in part to having his legal license revoked for his actions, returned to Genoa City four years later, determined to get revenge on Christine. He did this by representing Phyllis Summers, with whom he also had a brief affair, in the custody battle for her son, Daniel Romalotti. Phyllis, a computer expert, hacked into a computer and changed DNA tests so that it would appear Daniel was the father of Daniel Junior, when in fact he was not. Christine, who was representing Danny Romalotti, ultimately won the case. Michael and Phyllis still remain friends. Months later, Michael begged Christine to help him get his law license back. She agreed, but only after Michael donated a kidney to Danny. Michael was released from jail and convinced Christine that he was a changed man, so she testified for him and his legal license was reinstated under Chris's watchful eye. The cocky and very successful Michael was a constant thorn in Christine's side, but somehow convinced her to join him in starting a law practice together, Baldwin, Blair & Associates (formerly Baldwin, Williams & Associates). The practice was so successful that she again put having a family on hold, causing a great rift in her marriage to Paul. In a desperate attempt to mend their marriage while still furthering her career, Christine took a case in Hong Kong which would mean moving there for several months. Paul first balked at the idea, but then decided to \\"do it for them\\", put his career on hold and move. But at the last minute, Paul backed out, so Christine lived in Hong Kong for months on her own with very little contact. Christine was offered a case in Australia when the Hong Kong case was finished, but she turned it down and was determined to go home to Genoa City and try to mend her shattered marriage. She arrived at the apartment only to find Paul in the arms of his new client, Isabella Bra√±a, whom Michael had asked to come to Genoa City to break up Paul and Christine. Without a word to Paul, she accepted the case in Australia and filed for, and was soon granted, a divorce. Isabella didn't want to tell Paul that she was pregnant with his child because she felt that he was too hung up on Chris. Isabella had a brief affair with Michael and told him that he was the father. Michael was outraged at first and even drew up legal papers for her to sign. But Isabella had something on Michael from the past, so he backed down and went along with her demands of rent, baby furniture, and everything she needed to live until the baby was born. Michael also arranged for a job for her in another town for afterward. Just as Michael was softening to the idea of a child and a future with Isabella, and Paul was getting involved with former wife Lauren Fenmore, Paul found out about the baby's paternity and wanted to be a father to the child. With this major lie, Isabella fell out of grace with both Michael and Mary, Paul's mother. Paul moved in with Isabella and she continued to use manipulating Paul to keep him under her thumb as tightly as possible. Mary went to great lengths to try to convince him that Isabella was wrong for him and would ruin his life, and to convince Isabella to go away to a home for unwed mothers. All despite the fact that Isabella was providing Mary with the grandchild, and Paul with the child, they both had always wanted. Mary even begged for help from unlikely sources in Lauren, Christine, and even Michael - all of whom she disapproves as well, but had had no luck at all. But Paul moved out on his own volition when Isabella started pressuring him to get married. Their baby boy, Ricardo, was born, but unlike Isabella's delusions, Paul was not willing to become a happy family with her. Complicating things was the sudden return of Christine, who rebuffed him for the baby's sake, although she still had feelings for Paul. Paul's response was to marry Isabella. Christine spent long hours working with Michael and they became closer, sharing dinners and their feelings together. They finally broached the subject of their past, and although Christine agreed Michael was a changed man, it still haunted her. That and her lingering feelings for Paul made it rough on Michael. But Christine decided to put the past behind her and accepted Michael's marriage proposal. Paul invited Isabella's estranged father Ricardo to Ricky's christening, and father and daughter happily reunited. Michael showed up, asked Ricardo not to mention they knew each other or Isabella's past, then announced his engagement to Chris, much to Paul's rage. Paul attacked Michael, who left with a black eye. Paul showed up at Christine's apartment and forced himself on her. This storyline caused a stir among viewers as it was unknown whether it was rape or just \\"rough sex\\". The next morning Christine tracked Paul down to a deserted beach in Los Angeles where she initiated sex herself. Later Chris disappeared, leaving both Michael and Paul wondering. Christine was gone for months when the guilt got to Paul, and he told Isabella that he and Chris had sex that night. Isabella left him, only returning occasionally to see Ricky. Chris returned in disguise as the dark-haired mysterious Kelly Simmons, bent on getting information on Isabella. Paul saw through Chris' disguise, and they came to an understanding about the \\"rape,\\" but Paul chose Isabella and his son. Paul took Ricky to Isabella's parents in L.A., leaving her to finish packing for their move there. Just before they were to be married, Michael confessed to Chris that he set up Isabella to meet Paul so she and Paul would split for good, then Michael could have Chris. Chris exploded, walked out on Michael, and flew to L.A. to tell Paul the whole story. Upon their return to Genoa City, Paul moved back into their former apartment with Chris, while Isabella plotted revenge. One night, Isabella called her only friend, Diane Jenkins (Susan Walters) who was with Michael, telling them someone was breaking in then screamed. When Michael arrived he found what appeared to be a bloody murder scene and Isabella missing. Christine woke up unconscious in her car in the woods and told Michael and Paul of her only memory - Isabella screaming not to hurt her, of blood, and a boat. Michael tracked down the boat, which was covered in blood, and destroyed the evidence against Chris. The night before Chris was to be arrested for Isabella's murder, she was attacked in her bathtub by a very much alive Isabella, who had drugged Christine's wine, telling her how she had set her up, while wielding a butcher knife. Paul arrived in the nick of time, slugged Isabella and knocked her out. As he was reviving the nearly drowned Christine, Michael arrived and saved them both from the crazed Isabella. The cops arrived and hauled Isabella away. She was committed to a mental institution, and Paul and Christine were free to be together once again. Michael apologized to Chris for all the misery he had caused her, she forgave him and they are still close friends. Though Michael didn't realize it at the time, his biggest trouble had yet to confront him‚Äîhis own family. In 2003, Michael was shocked when his half-brother Kevin Fisher arrived after landing in a heap of legal trouble. To help Kevin get a fresh start, Michael allowed him to stay with him. They were soon joined by their mother Gloria. Victoria Newman and Michael began to grow close. They fell in love; however, Victoria left Michael and Genoa City, when family problems became too much for her to handle. Shortly thereafter, Michael began dating retail store owner Lauren, They initially kept their relationship a secret due to Kevin's attraction to Lauren, but eventually they became engaged, and were married. Kevin, by this time, had gotten over his infatuation with Lauren and was Michael's best man. Victoria returned to town, arriving at Michael's doorstep expecting to pick up where they left off. Michael informed her that he was now married to Lauren, and Victoria bowed out gracefully. A year later, Lauren gave birth to a son, Fenmore \\"Fen\\" Baldwin. Life as a husband and father was good for Michael, but his family troubles where his mother Gloria and Kevin were concerned were just beginning. Michael continued to put his job at risk with his family's endless legal troubles, such as Gloria's involvement in the Jabot product tampering case, Kevin landing in trouble with the government after keeping stolen money, and investigating the murder of Carmen Mesta, who was murdered by Kevin's girlfriend Jana Hawkes. Michael then had to contend with defending Phyllis after she was arrested for blackmailing Sharon Abbott and Brad Carlton about their affair. Unfortunately, Phyllis was convicted and sentenced to six years in prison. After a few months, her conviction was overturned and she was released. Michael was then blindsided with yet another case when Victor was charged with the murder of Ji Min Kim. However, the charges were dropped when Michael discovered that the star witness had actually lied about Victor's whereabouts. Michael decided to resume the search for information on his father, River Baldwin. His grandmother's journal described Lowell as a substance abusing criminal; Gloria, on the other hand, described Lowell as handsome and charismatic. Shortly after Michael was born, though, Lowell was drafted and fled to Canada. With these new bits of information in hand, Michael decided to start searching for his estranged father in Canada rather than the United States. He had given up the search by the time of his brother Kevin's marriage with Jana at an ashram. There he met his father, who married them, and is going by the name River. He claims he has been on the run after falsely accused of murder in a protest-gone-wrong in the sixties. Michael returns to Genoa City, disturbed, and several weeks later Lowell shows up at Michael's doorstep. After he and Gloria spend a night reminiscing, a jealous Jeffrey Bardwell tips the FBI about Lowell's location and he is arrested in a diner just before catching a bus out of town. Just as he is about to be moved to a new location for custody before his trial, his daughter Eden Gerick, who would also be Michael's sister, arrives in Genoa City, and pleads Michael to be her father's lawyer. On March 23, 2010, Michael discovers that his wife, Lauren Fenmore had made out with his client and her ex-husband, Paul Williams for one night. Michael later lets go of Paul and tells him to find a new lawyer. Later, Lauren says she was drunk at the time and she was possibly being drugged as someone took pictures of her with Paul at Jimmy's Bar. In June 2010, Michael is shocked to learn from Lauren that Jill Abbott is her paternal half-sister, and he shares in his wife's anger over Jill changing her last name to Fenmore. Michael does try to convince Lauren to at least give Jill a chance, but Lauren stubbornly refuses to do so due to Jill filing a suit asking for a portion of the estate of her and Lauren's late father Neil Fenmore. He is later relieved when the two women work out their differences and start developing a sisterly relationship. Michael also has to help with Lauren's continued struggle against the Carters. Sarah Smythe, the sister of Sheila, came to Genoa City looking just like Lauren after plastic surgery. Sarah along with Sheila's daughter, Daisy Carter, tortured Lauren in a cage. Michael found Lauren, and Lauren ended up shooting Sarah. Daisy escaped, but later returned pregnant with Daniel Romalotti's child. Phyllis tried to win over custody rights from Daisy, which greatly angered Michael and Lauren. Eventually, Phyllis won and Daisy escaped again. Michael was eventually fired from Newman Enterprises and was replaced by Avery Bailey Clark. Michael ended up becoming the new Genoa City District Attorney. As DA he led charges against Phyllis once it finally discovered that she ran down Christine Blair and Paul Williams years earlier. During the case, Kevin was involved because of his connection during the unexpected death of Tim Reid, Phyllis's old doctor. This strained their relationship, but later the case against Phyllis was dropped when a judge determined that statute of limitations limited the case. Fen ended up getting involved with Summer Newman, who slowly became more rebellious due to her family issues. Lauren and Michael were against their involvement, but Fen and Summer continued together and both began a bullying scheme against a troubled fellow student, Jamie Vernon. Summer later quit the scheme, but the tension between Fen and Jamie worsened as Michael and Lauren tried to help Jamie. Eventually, Fen and Jamie fought on the roof of a building downtown and Jamie fell onto a roof below. It wasn't clear if Fen pushed him, but when Jamie woke up in the hospital, he blamed Fen and wanted to press charges. Michael believed Jamie, but Lauren refused to believe that Fen pushed him. The tension between Lauren and Michael worsened when Michael ended up continuing the investigation and arrested Fen. In 2014, Michael is under a lot of stress with his workload, so he decides to join partner law with Avery, after Leslie became an assistant district attorney, leaving Avery without a partner. Michael continues to be stressed out, so Lauren suggested Michael to go to the doctor. Michael went to the doctor, where he decides to prescribe himself with a similar drug to Viagra to help Lauren and his problem in bed. Michael went to the doctor after trying the prescription and the doctor says everything is clear. After going to the doctor, the doctor called Michael back with the lab results. The doctor explained to Michael that his PSA is elevated, which Michael asked if he has cancer. The doctor diagnosed Michael with stage 3 prostate cancer. So far, only Kevin, Lauren, Fen, Phyllis, and Jill knows Michael has stage 3 prostate cancer. Michael is planning on telling the rest of his family and friends his news eventually. Michael represented Lily in her divorce to Cane in November 2017. He also later represents Lily in 2019, when she files for divorce once again. Michael also represents Nikki and Victoria in the case of J.T.

The shell of this species lacks a callus, leaving the umbilicus exposed, in which the inner coils of the shell are visible. This opening constitutes about 15% of the shell diameter at its widest point. Like all Nautilus species, N. macromphalus usually lives at depths of several hundred metres. During the night, however, they rise to much shallower waters (2 to 20 m depth) to feed. The tentacles of this species are long and thin, having raised ridges which help provide grip when catching prey. N. macromphalus is the smallest species of nautilus. The shell is usually up to around 16 cm in diameter, although the largest specimen ever recorded measured 180 mm. More than 35 shells of N. macromphalus dating to around 6400‚Äì7100 years BP were found in a cenote on Lifou, the Loyalty Islands. Based on these radiocarbon dates it is thought the cenote was connected to marine waters for some 700 years before becoming cut off completely. During this time nautiluses were able to enter it through a flooded karst system.

It is a resident breeding species from central Mexico to Costa Rica. It was formerly placed in the genus Thryothorus (Mann et al., 2006). This wren breeds in lowlands and foothills from sea level up to 800 m altitude in open or scrubby woodland, including forest clearings and second growth. It mainly occurs on the Pacific side of the central mountain ranges. Its flask-shaped nest has a long entrance tube angled downward and is lined with fine grasses. It is constructed 1‚Äì2.5 m high in a fork of a thorny tree or shrub, often close to a wasp nest. The female alone incubates the three or four unspotted white or pale greenish-blue eggs for about two weeks to hatching, and the young fledge in about the same length of time again. The adult banded wren is 13.5 cm long and weighs 20 g. It has chestnut brown upperparts, strong white supercilia, a brown stripe through the eye and black streaking on the white cheeks. The underparts are white with much black barring on the lower belly and flanks. The wings and tail are barred with black. Young birds have duller upperparts and dull white underparts, faintly mottled with dusky brown. The call of this species is a nasal cherrrt or a rattle and roll, kert rrruk kert rrruk, and the melodious and complex song is a mix of clear whistles and musical trills. The banded wren forages actively in low vegetation or sometimes on the ground in pairs or family groups. It eats mainly eats insects, spiders and other invertebrates.

History Garhmukteshwar is an ancient place that is mentioned in the Bhagavata Purana and the Mahabharata. There are claims that it was a part of ancient Hastinapur, the capital of the Pandavas. An ancient fort, repaired by the Maratha leader Mir Bhawan, became, under the British, the headquarters of the tehsil. The name of the town is derived from the temple of Mukteshwar Mahadeva, dedicated to the goddess Ganga who is worshipped there in four temples. The town has 80 sati pillars, marking the spots where Hindu widows are said to have become satimata. The town also has a mosque, built by Gays- ud-din Balban, that bears an inscription in Arabic dating to 682 Hijri (1283 A.D.). =Partition violence= Garhmukteshwar was the scene of major anti- Muslim violence in November 1946, at a time when various areas of British India were experiencing significant communal unrest as the partition of the country into India and Pakistan loomed. Gyanendra Pandey describes the place as \\"a metaphor for the atrocities of Partition; and Partition itself a metaphor for the kind of extraordinary genocidal violence that was not witnessed again in India, perhaps until 1984\\". A mela (fair) held from the town was attended by between 700,000 - 800,000 people and on 6 November 1946 there were a series of attacks on Muslim shopkeepers at the event, resulting in 46 deaths and a further 39 people injured. The assaults and also arson attacks continued on and off for several days at the mela, while the town of Garhmukteshwar itself witnessed a large number of anti-Muslim atrocities, including killings, arson and the destruction of the Muslim quarter. Official reports gave the Muslim death toll in the town as at least 214 people, and there were also quite a lot Hindu deaths in retaliatory attacks.

Chamunda Mata Temple Chamunda (Sanskrit: ‡§ö‡§æ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§£‡•ç‡§°‡§æ, CƒÅmu·πá·∏çƒÅ), also known as Chamundi, Chamundeshwari and Charchika, is a fearsome aspect of Devi, the Hindu Divine Mother and one of the seven Matrikas (mother goddesses). She is also one of the chief Yoginis, a group of sixty-four or eighty-one Tantric goddesses, who are attendants of the warrior goddess Durga.[2] The name is a combination of Chanda and Munda, two monsters whom Chamunda killed. She is closely associated with Kali, another fierce aspect of Devi.[3] She is sometimes identified with goddesses Parvati, Chandi or Durga as well. The goddess is often portrayed as haunting cremation grounds or fig trees. The goddess is worshipped by ritual animal sacrifices along with offerings of wine and in the ancient times, human sacrifices were offered too. Originally a tribal goddess, Chamunda was assimilated in Hinduism and later entered the Jain pantheon too. Though in Jainism, the rites of her worship include vegetarian offerings, and not the meat and liquor offerings. Shri Kaleshwar Temple Shri Kaleshwar Mandir is a large Hindu temple in Garoth city.

Life and career =Early training and career= Ruggero Raimondi was born in Bologna, Italy, during World War II. His voice matured early into its adult timbre, and at the age of 15, he auditioned for conductor Francesco Molinari-Pradelli, who encouraged him to pursue an operatic career. He began vocal studies with Ettore Campogalliani, and was accepted at age 16 as a student at the Giuseppe Verdi Conservatory in Milan.

It was first described by Victorian state botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1864, and no subspecies are recognised. It gained its specific name as its leaves are reminiscent of a fern (Blechnum). B. blechnifolia is one of several closely related species that grow as prostrate shrubs, with horizontal stems and leathery, upright leaves. The red-brown flower spikes, known as inflorescences, are up to high and appear from September to November in the Australian spring. As the spikes age, each turns grey and develops as many as 25 woody seed pods, known as follicles. Insects such as bees, wasps, ants and flies pollinate the flowers. Found in sandy soils in the south coastal region of Western Australia in the vicinity of Lake King, B. blechnifolia is non-lignotuberous, regenerating by seed after bushfire. The plant adapts readily to cultivation, growing in well-drained sandy soils in sunny locations. It is suitable for rockeries and as a groundcover. Description Banksia blechnifolia is a prostrate shrub that grows to about high and spreads to across. It has thick horizontal stems up to long and thick that lie on top of the ground. They are covered in fine rusty- brown fur, which turns grey with age. The leathery herringbone leaves rise vertically from the stems on thick long petioles, which have two narrow ribs on the undersurface. The leaves themselves are long, with 8‚Äì22 deep lobes on each leaf edge. Narrowly triangular to roughly linear in shape and long, these lobes are either oppositely or alternately arranged along the leaf midline, and arise at 60‚Äì80 degrees. The leaf blade narrows for the top third of its length to a pointed apex. Flowering occurs from mid September to late November, with the flower spikes, known as inflorescences, arising at the ends of the stems. Up to high and wide, they are overall red-brown to salmon- coloured. The individual flowers are reddish pink with a cream base, fading to light brown and then grey as they age. The perianth is long, includes a 3.5‚Äì5 mm limb and is covered in fine fur. Old flowers remain on the spike, obscuring the developing seed pods known as follicles. Up to 25 in number, these are covered in fur and oval, measuring long, by high, and wide. The obovate (egg- shaped) to cuneate (wedge-shaped) seed is long. It is composed of the wedge- shaped seed body (containing the embryonic plant), measuring long by wide, and a papery wing. One side, termed the outer surface, is convex and pale greyish brown with irregular pits and the inner surface is dark brown and smooth. The seeds are separated by a sturdy dark brown seed separator roughly the same shape as the seeds with a depression where the seed body sits adjacent to it in the follicle. The first pair of leaves produced by seedlings, known as cotyledons, are wedge-shaped with a convex apical side and measure long by wide. Dark green in colour, they are faintly reticulated. The auricle at the base of the cotyledon leaf is pointed and measures long. The cotyledons sit on a short thick hypocotyl. Taxonomy Victorian state botanist Ferdinand von Mueller first recounted Banksia blechnifolia in 1864, from material collected in 1861 by a G. Maxwell. The species name is derived from Blechnum, a genus of fern, and folium \\"leaf\\", hence \\"fern-leaved\\". Von Mueller held it to be close to , but in his 1870 arrangement, English botanist George Bentham regarded it as synonymous with that species. Von Mueller wrote of it again in 1869 as a variety of B. repens, giving it the name Banksia pinnatisecta. The species was then mostly forgotten until 1931, when it was collected again by Western Australian botanists William Blackall and Charles Gardner near Middle Mount Barren. As the region was opened up to agriculture, the species was collected more often during the following decades. It was informally known as Banksia sp. \\"Lake King\\" during this time and was brought into cultivation. No subspecies are recognized. In his 1981 monograph The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae), Australian botanist Alex George resurrected B. blechnifolia as a valid species, placing it in B. subgenus Banksia because its inflorescence is a typical Banksia flower spike shape, in B. section Banksia because of its straight styles, and Banksia series Prostratae, because of its prostrate habit, along with five other closely related species. George, like von Mueller, held it to be related to B. repens and . In 1996, botanists Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published an arrangement informed by a cladistic analysis of morphological characteristics. This arrangement maintained the species' placement in ser. Prostratae but found the most closely related taxon to be , based on their common narrow-lobed leaves, and the next closest relative to be B. repens. George later published an updated version of his 1981 arrangement in his 1999 treatment of Banksia for the Flora of Australia series of monographs. In all three arrangements, section Prostratae is circumscribed with little to no differences, though its placement within the broader system differs. The placement of B. blechnifolia in George's 1999 arrangement may be summarised as follows: Developing buds Habit Stems with developing leaves :Banksia ::B. subg. Banksia :::B. sect. Banksia ::::B. ser. Salicinae (11 species, 7 subspecies) ::::B. ser. Grandes (2 species) ::::B. ser. Banksia (8 species) ::::B. ser. Crocinae ::::B. ser. Prostratae (6 species, 3 varieties) :::::B. goodii :::::B. gardneri ::::::B. gardneri var. gardneri ::::::B. gardneri var. brevidentata ::::::B. gardneri var. hiemalis :::::B. chamaephyton :::::B. repens :::::B. blechnifolia :::::B. petiolaris ::::B. ser. Cyrtostylis (13 species) ::::B. ser. Tetragonae (3 species) ::::B. ser. Bauerinae (1 species) ::::B. ser. Quercinae (2 species) :::B. sect. Coccinea (1 species) :::B. sect. Oncostylis (4 series, 22 species, 4 subspecies, 11 varieties) ::B. subg. Isostylis (3 species) Since 1998, American botanist Austin Mast has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae, which includes Banksia. With respect to B. blechnifolia, Mast's results have some semblance to George and Thiele's, as B. repens, B. chamaephyton and B. blechnifolia form a closely knit group within this group, although the overall inferred phylogeny is very different from George's arrangement. Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement of Banksiinae by publishing several new names, including subgenus Spathulatae for the species of Banksia that have spoon-shaped cotyledons; in this way they also redefined the autonym B. subgenus Banksia. They have not yet published a full arrangement, but if their nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B. blechnifolia is placed in subgenus Banksia. In a 2013 cladistics study, evolutionary scientists Marcell Cardillo and Renae Pratt found that B. blechnifolia diverged from a lineage that gave rise to B. goodii, B. gardneri and B. repens. Distribution and habitat Endemic to Western Australia, B. blechnifolia is found in the state's south between Jerramungup and Gibson, and north towards the vicinity of Lake King. It grows in flat areas, on white sands in kwongan or mallee kwongan communities. It is not found within of the coast. Ecology Like many plants in Australia's southwest, Banksia blechnifolia is adapted to an environment in which bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. B. blechnifolia and the related B. petiolaris are in the former category‚Äîrapid growing plants killed by bushfire and regenerating by seed‚Äîwhile the other prostrate species are slow growing resprouters. Like other banksias, B. blechnifolia plays host to a variety of pollinators‚Äîinsects such as bees, wasps, ants and flies were all recorded in the 1988 The Banksia Atlas survey. Cultivation Inoculation experiments found that B. blechnifolia is resistant to dieback. It is one of the Western Australian banksia species that adapts best to cultivation, having been readily grown in eastern states. Rusty new growth and fern-like leaves are its main horticultural features. It requires well-drained soil, preferably fairly sandy, although it can tolerate some clay. Extra water in warm weather can result in vigorous growth. Some specimens reach diameter in cultivation. It makes an attractive prostrate groundcover, especially in rockeries, though its growth is not dense enough to suppress weeds arising within it. Ample mulching minimises weed growth. It is hardy to moderate frosts. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 14 to 49 days to germinate. B. blechnifolia takes 4‚Äì5 years to flower from seed in cultivation.

Later, the bombings were used against anyone working towards racial desegregation in the city. One neighborhood within Birmingham experienced so many bombings it developed the nickname of Dynamite Hill. History By the 1940s, black families were trying to purchase homes in segregated white areas of Birmingham. The local Ku Klux Klan began a terror campaign against black families attempting to move to the west side of Center Street, sometimes firing shots or bombs at houses, or lighting a home's door on fire. Center Street became known as Dynamite Hill because of these attacks. From the late 1940s to the 1960s over 40 unsolved bombings occurred in Birmingham. Klan members specifically targeted civil rights lawyer Arthur Shores who lived in Birmingham.

Patparganj has remained the Delhi Legislative Assembly constituency with East Delhi, Lok Sabha constituency, from 1993 to 2008, and remained after the delimitation of 2008. History Patparganj in 1777 map of Delhi and Agra area In the 18th century, Patparganj was a flourishing town and an important grain market of Delhi, where wholesale grain merchants stayed and large enclosures were built to store grain from the doab region and ferried across Yamuna River into Paharganj market, and the walled city of Shahjahanabad (Old Delhi) markets. Towards the end of the reign of Ahmad Shah as his political fortunes declined, and Delhi was wrought by internal fighting, the Mughal empire owed a debt of 15 lakhs to the Najib Khan Rohilla and Bahadur Khan Balauch, thus a settlement was reached and the revenue of village in the Ganges‚ÄìYamuna doab was assigned to them. However, on 26 November 1753, they left Delhi. After crossing the Yamuna, they captured Patparganj and seized the headman and the toll-offices. They left only after they received a ransom of Rs. 35,000. Much of the town was destroyed during the period. In later history, Patparganj was the location of the Battle of Delhi, which took place on 11 September 1803 during the Second Anglo-Maratha War, between British troops under General Lake, and Marathas of Scindia's army under General Louis Bourquin, also giving the battle its local name, Battle of Patparganj. After the British victory, the city of Delhi surrendered three days later. Patparganj was almost a deserted town for years to come.Fanshawe, p. 69Fanshawe, p. 232 A monument was later erected at the site, marked out by a surrounding ditch, commemorating Maj. Middleton (3rd Bengal Cavalry), Cornet Sanguine (27th Light Dragoons) and British soldiers who fell during the battle. The monument today stands as a well maintained sandstone slab at the Noida Golf Course and maintained by the authority. Post-independence, Patparganj saw rapid development as Delhi spilled into the trans-Yamuna area, and by the 1990s, many apartment complexes and society apartment blocks had come up. Meanwhile, 175 acres of land was allocated to various group housing societies, previously earmarked for the development of an industrial area in the Delhi Master Plan. In 2010, a 690-m long six-lane flyover opened near the Patparganj Industrial Area', between Anand Vihar and Ghazipur crossing, to decongest traffic in the area. Overview Patparganj (Indraprastha Extension) is home to a large number of group housing societies, and many multi-storeyed apartment blocks. Well-connected with neighbouring residential colonies, its nearby areas are Preet Vihar, Nirman Vihar, Laxmi Nagar, Pandav Nagar and Mayur Vihar. Parparganj is also known for its industrial area known as Patparganj industrial area. A number of prominent civil servants and former diplomats of India have retired here and had colonies and apartments built for themselves by the Government. These are also otherwise popularly known as the IFS (Indian Foreign Service) and the IAS (Indian Administrative Service) colonies. Over the years, Madhu Vihar has developed into a busy market place of Patparganj. Balco market, named after a neighbouring apartment of the same name, is another popular community market in Patparganj that has ATMs, banks, stationery shops, Guitar School Guitarmonk, a Mother Dairy outlet and various other shops.http://wikimapia.org/9231039/Balco-Market Established in 2005, Max Hospital at Patparganj, was the first multi-specialty tertiary care centre in East Delhi. Patparganj has some well renowned schools such as National Victor Public School, Plato Public School and St. Andrews School to name a few. National Victor Public School is the first school to offer evening sports facilities to the residents of nearby apartments. The area is well connected by regular bus services, Auto rickshaw, Uber and Ola cabs along with Cycle rickshaws. The construction of Delhi Metro's New line will give a big boost to its connectivity with other areas of Delhi.Max Healthcare Institute - History Demographics India census, Patparganj had a population of 34,409.

It can be found on fore reef slopes in depths ranging from 95m to 504m but typically prefers to remain within 150-300m where water temperatures range between 16.6 to 9.4¬∫C. N. belauensis are highly mobile epibenthic scavenging herbalist and opportunistic predators that relies mostly on scent detection. They are active both diurnally and nocturnally within the preferred depth range although most shallow-water- incursions are usually nocturnal events that coincide with greatly diminished fish activities.  Anatomy  N. belauensis‚Äô shell is similar to that of N. pompilius, but it is distinguished by its larger mean mature shell diameter and shell weight. Its shell characteristic pattern consists of bifurcating brown to red stripes that extend from the umbilicus to the venter without coalescing across the venter with delicate, longitudinally crenulated ridges that produce a distinctive, concentrically lirate pattern. It can also be distinguished from N. pompilius by its inwardly sloping umbilical walls and evenly rounded umbilical shoulder. The shell is also distinguishable by the presence of longitudinally crenulated shell sculpture, and a broadly triangular central rachidian radular tooth and a lack of umbilical callus. Fresh shells were also found to implode at 680-789m depth equivalent pressures.  Development  At the immature/juvenile stage the Palau nautilus‚Äô shell is covered in colored bands. Its body chamber is covered by a thick, gelatinous, and slippery periostracum. As it reaches the sub mature stage, most of its body chamber is white but with thin margins. However, it still lacks a black layer that develops upon maturity. Maturity in the Palau nautilus is reached when there is a rapid decrease in growth rate until there is no additional growth. The body chamber shell wall thickens with deposition of a black layer along the apertural margin and the accentuation of the hyponomic and ocular sinuses. The exterior body chamber lacks colour banding. The last septum is thickened but has a reduced volume in the final chamber. There are usually around 35 septa in the shell. The maximum observed range in shell sizes extends from 180mm to 239mm in diameter with the umbilical diameter taking up 16% of the shell diameter. The Palau nautilus can live for 5-10 years after reaching maturity and have a life span that may range beyond 20 years.  Behaviour  The Palau nautilus is able to traverse across a wide range of temperatures and great lateral distances in short periods of time. It is also able to survive in warm water up to 30¬∫C for tens of hours up to several days. It typically migrates from deeper water into shallower water following sunset and returns to the deep before sunlight. It is also able to travel an average distance from 0.45km per day over 322 days up to 0.8km per day over 5 days.

It is situated on the mid-western bank of the Gulf of Khambhat. Also known as Gogo, it was an important historical commercial port on the Arabian Sea until the development of nearby Bhavnagar in the nineteenth century. Etymology The name Gogha has been traced to the famous Rajput warrior and hero Gogobava. A more likely derivation is from the shell, goghala, common along the coast.Trans. Bom. Geo. Soc. VII. 103 [1846]Tod's Rajasthan, II. 413. ed. 1873 Demographics In 1872, it had a population of 9,571. As of the 2011 census of India, Ghogha had a population of 12,208; 49% male and 51% female, and 12.71% of the population was under 6 years of age. The average literacy rate was 70% (below the national average of 74.4%) with male literacy being 77%, and female literacy 63%. Historical information The port of Gogha has been active since the 5th century CE and flourished as a major trading post during the 10th to 16th century CE before Bhavnagar took the place of Gogha as a trading centre. Being located at a strategic position in the Gulf, Gogha has always been an important trading centre and consequently been attacked several times and captured by local rulers like Gohel Rajputs and Muslims during the medieval period (Bell, 1980:73). Stone anchors have been found there from several locations along the Indian coast such as Dabhol (Gaur et al. 2007b) Sindhudurg (Sila and Gaur, 1997) and Vijaydurg (Sila et al., 1998), and have been dated to between the 8th and 14th centuries CE. The Imperial Gazetteer of India (1908:301) mentions that \\"the natives of this town are reckoned the best sailors or lascars in India. The ships touching here may procure water and supplies or repair damage\\". A famous proverb about Gogha is \\"Lankan Ladi ane Ghoghono var\\" (Bride of Lanka and groom of Gogha) which perhaps indicates some kind of direct overseas relation between Gogha and Sri Lanka. According to the historical account, Arabs established a colony at Gogha in 636 CE, though the earliest Arabic inscription found at Gogha dates to 1170 CE. Ancient Jain temples at Gogha from the 10th or 11th centuries suggest that it was also a religious centre. During the British period, ships up to 1500 tons were laden here. Pinkerton (1811) mentions that Gogha provided a harbour for the largest ships, though they would lie dry on mud at low water. Gogha served as a port for Cambay, loaded and unloaded with the aid of lighters, since Cambay was open only to very small vessels, e.g. boats called tawri (Habib, 1982) of up to 80 tons.Prof. Mehboob Desai, Ups and Downs of Ghogha: As a Port Town, unpublished research paper,p.2 History Ghogha was known as the port of Gundigar during Maitraka rule of Vallabhi (AD 480-720). Under Chaulukya dynasty rule (746-1297), except as a nursery for seamen, Ghogha was not a place of any note. One of the earliest mentions of the town is by French explorer Friar Jordanus, who, in 1321, passing north through Thane and Bharuch or as he writes it Parocco, stayed at 'Gogo'. Of the place he has left no details. At this time Ghogha is said to have been in the hands of Muslim soldiers of fortune, from whom, a few years later (1325), Mokhadaji Gohil, the Gohil chief of Umrala, took it and with the Piram Island made it his headquarters. As ruler of Piram, Mokhadaji levied toll from all ships passing up the Gulf. His exactions came to the knowledge of the emperor Muhammad bin Tughluq (1325-1351), then quelling a revolt in Gujarat, and, in 1347, Gogha was taken, Mokhadaji killed, and the Piram fort destroyed. The Emperor, satisfied with the destruction of Piram, left Gogha, at this time 'a great city with large markets,' in the hands of Dungarji, Mokhadaji's son. For about fifty years the Gohils held Ghogha. Near the close of the century (1390) they were forced to pay tribute to Muzaffar Shah I, the founder of the Gujarat Sultanate. In the fifteenth century, under the powerful Gujarat Sultanate rulers, the Gohils, though they kept their title of Ghogha chiefs, retired to Umrala. At this time Ghogha was probably under a Muslim governor. At the beginning of the sixteenth century (1503) it was entirely a Muslim town 'of great traffic in a fat and wealthy land.' Ten years later (1513), it was a very large town and a good port dealing in merchandize of all kinds and loading ships for Malabar and Aden. In the struggles for mastery at sea between the Gujarat kings and the Portuguese (1507-1538), Ghogha suffered. A strong and populous place of great trade surrounded by walls of brown stone, it was attacked and burnt by the Portuguese in 1531, and again, as it was beginning to recover, in 1546. Towards the close of the sixteenth century with the decay of Portuguese power, Ghogha seems to have regained its trade. When taken in 1591 by Khan-i-Azam Mirza Kotaltash, one of Akbar's viceroys, Ghogha was a large, well-built port with many merchants and ships, the cargoes of which went in small boats to Cambay. It was reckoned part of Sorath and, besides port dues, yielded a yearly revenue of ¬£1666 (666,560 dams). In 1612, on the advice of Khojah Nasar the Surat Governor, who praised its fine harbour and its trade with Cambay, the English gained leave to settle at Gogha. But the agent, Whittington, found it a poor town and no regular English factory was established. Two years later (1614), the Portuguese a third time destroyed Gogha, burning 120 trading boats and several ships, one of them the Rahimi, the great 1500 ton pilgrim ship. Following decline of Portuguese, the English were chief traders of the sea. With the Dutch, by raising Surat to be the chief port of Gujarat, the English injured the trade of the Cambay ports. Still during the seventeenth and for a few years of the eighteenth centuries, Gogha was the centre of a considerable traffic. The Portuguese boats met in its road and were convoyed to Goa by warships; and vessels belonging to the native merchants of Ahmedabad and Cambay sailed from Ghogha to south India and Arabia. Protected on the sea face by a stone fortification, and later on sheltered all round by a mud wall, with a local governor and a military force, Ghogha had a large number of traders, weavers, and sailors. Ghogha marked as Gogo in map of Ahmedabad district under Bombay Presidency, British India 1877 The eighteenth century was a time of decay. Trade fell off, and Ghogha, handed from one Muslim noble to another (1730-1751), taken by the Peshwa (1751-1755), recovered by the Nawab of Cambay (1755), and again (1764) taken by the Peshwa, was, under his managers, little able to compete with its pushing rival Bhavnagar. In 1803, when it came under British East India Company, the trade of Ghogha was almost gone. Later it was recovered somewhat under British rule and became part of Kathiawar Agency followed by Western India States Agency in 1924. When India became independent in 1947, it became part of Bhavnagar district in Saurashtra State which was later merged with Gujarat in 1960. Stone Anchors of Ghogha Gogha was the important port town during the medieval period and played as transit port between the ports of the upper part of the Gulf of Khambhat and rest of the ports along the Indian Ocean Countries. The discovery of various types of anchors suggests that boats of different origin visited Gogha port. The most important find is an anchor with wide groove on the all four section is probably of Chinese origin. For the first time glazed ware has been found associated with the stone anchors suggest that these may be dated between the 10th and the 16th century AD. Such a large number of stone anchors in an inter-tidal zone suggests the correct description provided in the Periplus of the Erythrenean Sea. The stone anchors have been noticed close to the present lighthouse in the inter-tidal zone. Being in the high tidal range, the stone anchors that are lying in 5 to 10 m water depth during high tide get exposed during low tide. These stone anchors are found either partially buried or exposed on the gravel bed. The seabed at the finding spot of the anchor consisted of gravel and fine sand. The majority of the anchors are of Indo-Arabia type and one stone anchor falls in the category of composite type. The Indo-Arabia type anchors of typically made from a vertical stone block with often square section with two lower holes are rectangular/ square and an upper circular hole. Two anchors in the group of Indo-Arab type are having uniform vertical deep and wide groove on all the four faces of the anchor. The broken single composite anchor is made of a thin limestone block with two lower holes are square and two circular holes are placed randomly on upper side. The detail measurements and drawing could be completed just of 14 anchors due to tidal time and muddy seabed and hence rest anchors were only photographed. Many stone anchors are fragmented in nature. Majority of the anchors are parted with lower 2 holes and sometimes holes also broken which might have been broken during manufacturing stage. The raw material used for these anchors are hard basaltic, sedimentary and a few of conglomeratic material. A fragmentary anchor is the biggest anchor found from here. Only lower portion is surviving and is very similar to those reported from Mithi Virdi. There is a stone block without any holes noticed similar to the Indo-Arabia type anchor.A.S.

This was the time when the Qibla (direction to be faced while praying salah) of the Muslims was Baitul Muqaddas (Jerusalem) instead of Mecca. For a brief period of 16 to 17 months, between 622 and 624 A.D., after the Hegira (migration) to Medina, Muhammed and his believers faced Jerusalem while praying salah between 610 to 623 A.D. This ancient mosque, locally known as Barwada Masjid or Juni (Old) Masjid, was built during this period and is one of the oldest mosques in India. Later, Muhammad received wahy (revelation) commanding him to change the orientation point from Jerusalem in the north to Mecca in the south. This mosque, therefore, predates all the other mosques in India whose mihrab face Mecca. It also bears the oldest Arabic inscription in India. The masjid falls under the care of Barwada Jamat.Prof.Mehboob Desai,Masjit during the time of Prophet Nabi Muhammed Sale Allahu Alayhi Wasalam,Divy Bhasakar,Gujarati News Paper, Thursday, column 'Rahe Roshan',24 May,page 4Kumar(Gujarati Magazine), Ahmadabad,July 2012,P 444 Stone Inscription at Ghogha 1\\\\. The stone containing this inscription is raised under an Ambli tree grown on the side of the way leading to the shrine of Piranpir on the sea-beach at Gogha, a British port in the Gulf of Cambay on the east coast of Kathiavad. It contains five lines written in Arabic characters. It measures 18¬∞ X 15\\", and mentions the death of a martyr named Baba Taju-ud-din in A.H. 591, A.D. 1195. The stone is the common sandstone, but well preserved. The translation of that characters is, \\"In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.There is no god but God ; Mahomed is the prophet of God. Every creature which lives on the earth is subject to decay ; but the glorious and honourable countenance of thy Lord shall remain for ever. Baba Taju-ud-din, son of Badr-ud-din, honoured by men ; fortunate, martyred, the oppressed, forgiven (by God), migrated from this house of destruction to that of eternity, in the month of Rabi-ul-akhir A.H. 591.\\" 2\\\\. The shrine of Hazrat Pir in which this inscription is found is situated on the seaside at Ghogha, a British port on the eastern coast of Kathiavad. It is cut into a white soft stone and has eight lines of Persian mixed with Arabic. The surface of the stone measiu-es 10\\" x 8\\". It refers to the building of a mosque by a Tandel (the head officer in a ship) named Bapuji in the year A.H. 1146, AD. 1733, during the reign of Emperor Mahomed Shah of Dellii. The translation of that characters is, \\"In the name of God the merciful and compassionate : There is no god but God ; Mahomed is the prophet of God : Therefore invoke not any other therein together with God. Mahomed Sliah, the conqueror of the world, the favourite of fortune, the king of the world, the Khalif of God ; may God perpetuate his kingdom and nile !

The stone in which this inscription is cut is built up in the wall of the Idagah, in a suburb at the town of Gogha, called Mosampura. It is a white stone containing nine lines of mixed Persian and Arabic composition, of which several letters are clear enough to make them out. It mentions the building of the Idagah bv one Kamal Hamid in the time of 2iafar Khan in A.H. 777, A.D. 1375-76. The translation of that characters is, \\"In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate. And when we ap-pointed the holy house of iMukkah to be a place of resort for inankind and a place of security, and said take the station of Abraham for a place of prayer.In the time of the refuge of the great sun of the world and religion, the refuge of victory, the Sultan and the great Khan, viz., Zefer Khan, son of Vajih-ul- Mulk.

May he remember the expectant slave with the_blessing of safety.Dated the 15th of Rajab, A.H. 777.May the peace and blessing of God be on him.\\" 4\\\\. This stone is raised near the mosque built near the house of one Dada MuUa on the way leading to the Gundi Gate at Gogha. It is a hard black stone witli a face measuring 1 7\\" x 14. The inscription appears to have been in Persian, as, with the exception of a few words, the whole of it has become undecipherable.There are in all nine hnes. It is dated A.H. 780, A.D. 1378-79. As many of the letters cannot be deciphered it is difficult to find out what it contains. The word \\"MuzeiFer\\" can be read, but it is doubtful. In the same line a name is distinctly read, which is Khan Anaj Mulamakan, A.H. 780.Corpus Inscripationum Bhavnagar Edited During the rule of H.11.

She was the chief assistant to Charles Kimberlin Brain during his directorship of the Transvaal Museum.The Songlines, Bruce Chatwin, Picador, 1988, pp. 271-2  Innovations  Vrba and colleague Stephen Jay Gould are renowned for their theory of exaptation. Stemming from Charles Darwin's research on genetic traits developed during adaptation in evolution, Vrba and Gould's research suggested that the historical origin of a genetic trait is not always reflective of its contemporary function. Genetic adaptations may take on new functions and may serve a species a different purpose further on in evolution. Gould died in 2002, but their theory has been widely referenced in recent years in popular science writing. Vrba and Gould's theory has also been criticized] in recent years by scholars who assert that genetic traits are pressured by multiple factors, making it challenging to determine when adaptation or exaptation is at play.

There are three main types of climbing competition: lead, speed, and bouldering. In lead climbing, the competitors start at the bottom of a route and must climb it within a certain time frame in a single attempt, making sure to clip the rope into pre-placed quickdraws along the route. Bouldering competitions consist of climbing short problems without rope, with the emphasis on number of problems completed and the attempts necessary to do so. Speed climbing can either be an individual or team event, with the person or team that can climb a standardized route the fastest winning. The International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) organizes some of the most important international sport climbing competitions, including the Climbing World Championships and the Climbing World Cup. Sport climbing will be in the Olympic Games for the first time in 2020.  Disciplines  = Lead climbing = In lead climbing, competitors climb a long, difficult route designed and set by the route setter and attempt to reach the top. The climber's performance is determined by the highest hold reached and whether or not that hold was \\"controlled\\", meaning the climber achieved a stable position on that hold, or \\"used\\", meaning the climber used the hold to make a controlled climbing movement in the interest of progressing along the route. In the case of a tie between athletes, the climber's score from the previous round and/or the time taken to ascend the route is used to break the tie. At championship- level events, lead climbers must climb the route on sight. This means that they are allowed only one attempt, and they are not allowed to see other climbers on the route, or receive any form of advice (beta) from others after the competition has started. Otherwise, later climbers would be able to learn from previous competitors' mistakes, giving them a considerable advantage. Climbers are usually given a limited amount of time to visually inspect the route from ground level before being sequestered. = Speed climbing = Speed climbing with two lanes Kids speed climbers in Mashhad Speed is the only factor that counts in a speed climbing event. It is top rope climbing in which competitors climb a slightly overhanging (at 5¬∞) IFSC-certified vertical piste with belaying from the top. Since 2007 the IFSC has created a standard wall layout for the world record. The climbing time is determined by mechanical- electric timing (the competitor strikes a switch at the top of the route); manually timing was allowed as a backup solution until 2018.IFSC Rules modification 2018 V1.5, April 2018 , Iranian climber Reza Alipourshenazandifar holds the men's 15-meter speed world record; 5.48 seconds, set at IFSC World Cup Nanjing, China on 30 April 2017. Aries Susanti Rahayu from Indonesia holds the women's 15-meter speed world record at 6.99 seconds, which was set at IFSC World Cup Xiamen, China on 19 October 2019, making her the first woman competitor to break the seven second mark in the 15-meter event. The team speed discipline was introduced as a medal showcase for the 2011 World Championship. It is a relay competition with teams of three. The teams are made up of 3 athletes of the same sex. Before the 2012 set of rules was introduced, the teams had to be mixed sexes. The race is held on the world record wall split into four lanes, two for each team. The first athlete races to hit the button at the top of the wall, at which point the second athlete climbs the second leg to release the third and final athlete whose final button marks the total time. = Bouldering = A bouldering competition consists of climbing on short walls without belay ropes. It differs from lead climbing competitions in that the climber can attempt a route more than once, but like lead climbing they cannot see other climbers on the boulder or receive from others any form of advice after the competition has started. In IFSC and Olympic competitions climbers are given a time of 4 minutes to give as many attempts as they want. Each competitor's score is determined by the overall number of routes finished and the number of attempts needed. Ranking is further subdivided by either a lead-style scoring system or with the use of a \\"bonus\\" hold. In a lead-style scoring system the climber is awarded a certain number of points for each hold they reach, with the highest points awarded for a finished route. The IFSC and Olympic competitions use a bonus hold called the \\"Zone\\"; the number of attempts to reach the Zone (if reached) further stratifies the competitors.  Main competitions  Some of the most widely known international competitions are administered by the International Federation of Sport Climbing, including: * The Climbing World Championship * The Climbing World Cup * The European Championships. Other widely known international competitions are: * Sportroccia * Rock Master * Sport climbing at the World Games * Melloblocco In the United States, the American Bouldering Series organizes regional, divisional and national events. = Olympic games = In August 2016 it was announced that climbing would be included in the 2020 Olympics.https://www.thebmc.co.uk/sport-climbing-olympic-games Athletes will be competing in a combined format; their lead, speed, and bouldering results will be combined to determine the winners. = Youth climbing = The main international youth climbing competitions are organized by the International Federation of Sport Climbing, including: * The IFSC Climbing World Youth Championships * The IFSC Climbing European World Cup In the United States, youth climbing is organized by USA Climbing (USAC).

Even so, he was considered a successor to the tlatoques, or rulers. Xochiquetzin was acquainted with Mart√≠n Ocelotl, a prominent Aztec who would be involved in a famous prosecution by the newly founded Inquisition of Mexico. Ocelotl was the main target of Bishop Juan de Zum√°rraga, but was spared until the death of Xochiquetzin. Xochiquetzin died in 1536 after ruling for five years. After his death the Spanish escalated their efforts to fight against paganism and the influence of the native upper classes.

The strike failed. The AA had formed in 1876. It was a labor union of skilled iron and steel workers which was deeply committed to craft unionism. However, technological advances had reduced the number of skilled workers in both industries. In 1892, the AA had lost a bitter strike at the Carnegie Steel Company's steel mill in Homestead, Pennsylvania. The Homestead strike, which culminated with a day- long gun battle on July 6 that left 12 dead and dozens wounded, led to a wave of de-unionization. From a high of more than 24,000 members in 1892, union membership had sunk to less than 8,000 by 1900. Forces prompting the strike The AA looked for growth in the tin industry, which still required skilled workers. By 1900, the union had organized 75 percent of the sheet metal mills and all but one of the tin mills in the country.Brody, 1969, p. 60. But the AA seriously misjudged both the economics and the technology underlying the tin industry. The formation of the American Tin Plate Company, a monopoly trust, on December 14, 1898, brought a number of nonunion plants into the union facilities of the American Tinplate Company. Daniel G. Reid, primary owner of the tin plate trust, agreed to recognize the AA at the nonunion plants after a token strike in 1899. The formation in March 1900 of the American Sheet Steel Company, another trust, also brought a number of nonunion plants together with unionized facilities. But this time the company refused to recognize the AA in the nonunion plants. Instead, the American Sheet Steel Co. idled its union facilities while keeping its nonunion works running at full speed.Brody, 1969, pp. 60‚Äì61. The AA attempted to counteract the power of the trusts by amending its constitution. A clause was added which required every mill in a trust to strike if even one mill in the trust struck.Brody, 1969, p. 61. Beginning of the crisis The formation of the U.S. Steel trust in 1901 threatened the AA with ruin. U.S. Steel not only combined Elbert Gary and J.P. Morgan's Federal Steel with Andrew Carnegie's steel operations, it also incorporated the plants of the American Tin Plate Co. The AA was confronted with a crisis: It had to organize the plants of U.S. Steel before the corporation, with its relatively infinite resources, could stop the union drives. But the executive committee of U.S. Steel was equally aware of the threat the AA posed, and the company's board of directors secretly adopted a resolution on June 17, 1901, opposing any unionization attempt. U.S. Steel's Tin Plate subsidiary reneged on promises to recognize the AA on the grounds that the union had not won contracts at every plant owned by the American Sheet Steel Co. Sheet Steel executives, meanwhile, not only refused to recognize the union at its nonunion plants but also began withdrawing recognition and refusing to bargain at its unionized plants.Brody, 1969, pp. 62‚Äì63; Dubofsky and Dulles, p. 174. The strike The AA tried to apply pressure on Sheet Steel by organizing U.S. Steel‚Äîthe company which supplied Sheet Steel with most of its raw material. The AA settled on staging a recognition strike. U.S. Steel executives, worried about the impact of a strike during a high-demand time of the year and angered that Sheet Steel executives had provoked a strike with stridently anti-union actions, demanded a compromise. Subsequently, Sheet Steel officers agreed on July 13, 1901 to recognize the union at 18 of the company's 23 nonunion plants. But AA president T.J. Shaffer rejected the deal; after having demanded the unionization of every Sheet Steel plant, he would not be satisfied with anything less. A meeting between Morgan and Shaffer (accompanied by AA secretary John Williams) resulted in an additional wage agreement. But this wage agreement, which covered only the existing unionized plants, was rejected by the AA executive board.Brody, 1969, pp. 63‚Äì66; Rayback, p. 218. At a meeting on August 3, 1901, Morgan refused to renegotiate the wage agreement. It had been agreed to by Shaffer and Williams, and he considered it binding. The AA executive board ordered Shaffer to call a strike, to begin on August 10. The strike was crushed. At several plants, workers refused to turn out at all. Union members in Illinois and Pennsylvania turned out in small numbers. Unionized facilities at the National Steel and National Tube subsidiaries turned out almost to a man, but the overall effect on U.S. Steel was too weak. Strikebreakers were pouring into plants by the thousands, and shuttered works were reopening. Shaffer appealed to Samuel Gompers, asking for American Federation of Labor support and the calling of a national labor conference to make the strike the federation's main issue. Gompers refused.Dubofsky and Dulles, p. 174; Brody, 1969, p. 66. The strike against U.S. Steel ended on September 14, 1901. The AA settled for terms far worse than those offered in August. Only plants which had started and ended the strike were covered, which meant that the union lost recognition at 15 plants. The company even won a pledge from the union not to organize any plant not already unionized, and to reject any offer of affiliation from a unionized plant.Foner, pp. 374‚Äì75; Brody, 1969, pp. 66‚Äì67. In March 1903, the American Sheet Steel Co. merged with U.S. Steel, ensuring its future as a nonunion company. Aftermath In A History of American Labor, Joseph G. Rayback has written, > After the strike was lost, the Amalgamated charged Gompers with > \\"lukewarmness\\" and Mitchell of the U.M.W. with failure to keep a promise to > support steelworkers. Although Gompers and Mitchell were exonerated by a > committee of the federation, the indictment made an impression. It served to > focus attention upon Gompers' and Mitchell's association with industrialists > in the National Civic Federation.

They served to retard the A.F.L.'s development > for more than a generation.Rayback, pp. 222‚Äì223. The AA never recovered from the U.S. Steel strike. It turned strongly conservative, hoping through submissiveness and cooperation to maintain its few remaining contracts. U.S. Steel slowly dismantled AA unions in its plants. When the company merged its National Steel and American Steel Hoop subsidiaries into its Carnegie Steel arm in 1903, the union found itself servicing contracts with the now-nonexistent Steel Hoop company rather than Carnegie. In the depression of 1904, the Carnegie Company demanded significant wage cuts. The union balked and struck, but by December the strike had been broken and the union had lost almost all of its Western affiliates. U.S. Steel idled AA mills whenever possible, breaking the union through attrition.Rayback, p. 218; Brody, 1969, pp. 68‚Äì69. Local AA unions often assisted in their own destruction. To make up for lower wages, AA members often worked overtime at regular pay rates or violated restrictions on speed- ups‚Äîin violation of their own union contracts. AA locals agreed time and again to wage cuts, eliminating the positive wage differential union shops had over nonunion facilities. This discouraged non-members from joining the union. U.S. Steel drove down wages so much that independent, nonunion plants had to cut salaries in order to stay competitive.Brody, 1969, pp. 68‚Äì69. By 1909, membership in the AA had sunk to 6,300, and the union was finished as a force in the American labor movement.Foner, p. 218. See also *Recognition strike Notes References * Brody, David.

TiNA is dedicated to the work and ideas of artistic communities not generally included in other major Australian arts festivals or institutions. The program includes the festivals Electrofringe, the National Young Writers' Festival, Critical Animals, and Crack Theatre Festival. Naming This Is Not Art takes its name from a piece of graffiti on what was Newcastle's tallest building, Latec House (now completely refurbished and converted to apartments), which had been derelict for several years. The name also refers to the content of the event, which is outside the ambit of traditional Australian arts festivals. History This Is Not Art evolved from the National Young Writers Festival and National Student Media Conference which were established in Newcastle in September 1998. In 1999, The National Young Writers Festival combined with the Electrofringe Festival (which had previously been an independently organised part of the now defunct Newcastle Fringe Festival) and moved to the October long weekend. In 2000, the addition of Sound Summit (then known as the National Independent Electronic Labels Conference) and several other smaller events necessitated the invention of an umbrella term to cover all of the disparate events. In 2002 Vital Focus Productions (now Minski Media) made a 25-minute open source documentary about TiNA called Dancing to Architecture - a motion picture about TiNA. For the first 3 years, This Is Not Art was directed by Marcus Westbury who had previously been the founding director of The National Young Writers' Festival. Structure Each year TiNA is produced by Octapod in partnership with arts collectives and organisations from across Australia. In 2015 TiNA will once again present programs from Crack Theatre Festival, National Young Writers‚Äô Festival and Critical Animals. Notable guests Over its lifespan a wide variety of guests have appeared at This Is Not Art including: Kevin Blechdom, Sage Francis, Cold Cut, The Light Surgeons, Caribou, Concord Dawn, Mad Professor, Anticon, Fat Cat Records, Paul Reed Smith, Little Nobody, b(if)tek, The Herd, Hrvatski, Thomas Frank, John Safran, Stephen Mayne, Margo Kingston, Nasenbluten, Marieke Hardy, DJ Scotch Egg, Leaf Cutter John, Tim Hecker and many more.

Tehuetzquititzin became both tlatoani and governor of Tenochtitlan in 1541, after the death of the previous governor, don Diego de Alvarado Huanitzin.

Red and orange colors indicate high levels of phytoplankton. The coastal zone color scanner (CZCS) was a multi- channel scanning radiometer aboard the Nimbus 7 satellite, predominately designed for water remote sensing. Nimbus 7 was launched 24 October 1978, and CZCS became operational on 2 November 1978. It was only designed to operate for one year (as a proof-of-concept), but in fact remained in service until 22 June 1986. Its operation on board the Nimbus 7 was limited to alternate days as it shared its power with the passive microwave scanning multichannel microwave radiometer. CZCS measured reflected solar energy in six channels, at a resolution of 800 meters. These measurements were used to map chlorophyll concentration in water, sediment distribution, salinity, and the temperature of coastal waters and ocean currents. CZCS lay the foundations for subsequent satellite ocean color sensors, and formed a cornerstone for international efforts to understand the ocean's role in the carbon cycle. Ocean color The Global Biosphere ‚Äì a composite of all 60,000 CZCS images plus three years of land vegetation data collected by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer instrument. The most significant product of the CZCS was its collection of so-called ocean color imagery. The \\"color\\" of the ocean in CZCS images comes from substances in the water, particularly phytoplankton (microscopic, free-floating photosynthetic organisms), as well as inorganic particulates. Because ocean color data is related to the presence of phytoplankton and particulates, it can be used to calculate the concentrations of material in surface waters and the level of biological activity; as phytoplankton concentration increases, ocean color shifts from blue to green (note that most CZCS images are false colored, so that high levels of phytoplankton appear as red or orange). Satellite-based ocean color observations provide a global picture of life in the world's oceans, because phytoplankton is the basis for the vast majority of oceanic food chains. By recording images over a period of years, scientists also gained a better understanding of how the phytoplankton biomass changed over time; for instance, red tide blooms could be observed when they grew. Ocean color measurements are also of interest because phytoplankton removes carbon dioxide from the sea water during photosynthesis, and so forms an important part of the global carbon cycle. Raw data from the scanner were transmitted, at an average bit rate of 800 kbit/s, to the ground station, where they were saved on magnetic tape. The tapes were then sent to the Image Processing Division at Goddard Space Flight Center. The processed data were archived at Goddard, and available to scientists worldwide. The data were originally stored on 38,000 nine track magnetic tapes, and later migrated to optical disc. The archive was one of the first instances of a system that provided a visual preview (\\"browse\\" ) of images, which assisted in ordering data. It became a model to be followed later by the Earth Observing System's Distributed Active Archive Centers. The sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS) was a follow-on to CZCS, launched in 1997. The MODIS/Aqua instrument currently provides ocean color data. Technical details An artist's rendering of the Nimbus satellites' design The CZCS instrument was manufactured by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp.. Reflected solar energy was measured in six channels to sense color caused by absorption due to chlorophyll, sediments, and gelbstoffe in coastal waters. The CZCS used a rotating plane mirror at a 45-degree angle to the optic axis of a Cassegrain telescope. The mirror scanned 360 degrees but only the 80 degrees of data centered on nadir were collected for ocean color measurements. The instrument viewed deep space and calibration sources during the remainder of the scan. The incoming radiation was collected by the telescope and divided into two streams by a dichroic beam splitter. One stream was transmitted to a field stop that was also the entrance aperture of a small polychromator. The radiance that entered the polychromator was separated and re-imaged in five wavelengths on five silicon detectors in the focal plane of the polychromator. The other stream was directed to a cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector in the thermal region (10.5‚Äì12.5 micrometer). A radiative cooler was used to cool the thermal detector. To avoid sun glint, the scanner mirror was tilted about the sensor pitch axis on command so that the line of sight of the sensor was moved in 2-degree increments up to 20 degrees with respect to the nadir. Spectral bands at 0.443 and 0.670 micrometers centered on the most intense absorption bands of chlorophyll, while the band at 0.550 micrometers centered on the \\"hinge point,\\" the wavelength of minimum absorption. Ratios of measured energies in these channels were shown to closely parallel surface chlorophyll concentrations. Data from the scanning radiometer were processed, with algorithms developed from the field experiment data, to produce maps of chlorophyll absorption. The temperatures of coastal waters and ocean currents were measured in a spectral band centered at 11.5 micrometers. Observations were made also in two other spectral bands, 0.520 micrometers for chlorophyll correlation and 0.750 micrometers for surface vegetation. The scan width was 1556 km centered on nadir and the ground resolution was 0.825 km at nadir.

A Queensland State of Origin and Australian international representative prop forward, in 2009 he broke the record for most international matches for Australia of any forward in history. Civoniceva played his club football for the Brisbane Broncos, with whom he won the 1998, 2000 and 2006 NRL Premierships, as well as for the Penrith Panthers, whom he captained. Late in his career whilst playing for the Redcliffe Dolphins in the Queensland Cup, Civoniceva captained the Fijian national team in their 2013 Rugby League World Cup campaign. The Petero Civoniceva Medal is awarded to the Australian Fijian rugby league footballer of the year, while the Civoniceva Medal is awarded to the Queensland Cup player voted as the best and fairest. Early life Civoniceva was born in Suva, Fiji, where his father, Petero Sr, was a rugby union player. Civoniceva's parents moved to Redcliffe, Queensland before his first birthday. There he attended Humpybong State School, then Redcliffe State High School before finishing his senior schooling at Frawley College, now known as Southern Cross Catholic College. He played junior football for the Redcliffe Dolphins until 1994.Civoniceva extends playing career with Redcliffe rleague.com, 5 November 2012 Playing career =Brisbane Broncos= After playing 39 reserve grade games he began his NRL career as a with the Brisbane Broncos. He won the club's Rookie of the Year award in 1998 and went on to play from the bench in Brisbane's 1998 NRL grand final win at the end of the season. Civoniceva missed the Broncos grand final victory in 2000 due to injury, as well as Australia's 2000 World Cup campaign. Having won the 2000 NRL Premiership, the Broncos travelled to England to play against 2000's Super League V Champions, St Helens R.F.C. for the 2001 World Club Challenge, with Civoniceva playing at prop forward in Brisbane's loss. His international and State of Origin debuts followed during that year. At the end of the 2001 NRL season, he went on the 2001 Kangaroo tour. Following the 2003 NRL season, Civoniceva played in the 2003 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France, helping Australia to victory over Great Britain in what would be the last time the two nations contested an Ashes series. Civoniceva won the Brisbane club's coveted Player of the Year award in 2004. Civoniceva was selected in the Australian team to compete in the end of season 2004 Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament. In the final game against Great Britain he played prop forward in the Kangaroos' 44‚Äì4 victory. He was the 2006 Brisbane Broncos season's player of the year and he played at prop in the Broncos' 2006 NRL Grand Final victory. As 2006 NRL Premiers, the Brisbane Broncos travelled to England to face 2006 Super League champions, St Helens R.F.C. in the 2007 World Club Challenge. Civoniceva played as a prop forward in the Broncos' 14‚Äì18 loss against St Helens, Civoniceva was again selected to play for the Australian national team as a prop forward the 2007 ANZAC Test match victory against New Zealand. During the 2007 NRL season, at the Broncos' 20-year anniversary celebration, the club announced a list of the 20 best players to play for them to date which included Civoniceva. In round 8 of NRL season 2007, Civoniceva played his 200th game for the Brisbane club, becoming only the eighth Broncos player to ever do so. Civoniceva's Brisbane contract ended at the conclusion of the 2007 season. The Broncos decision to withdraw the contract to the prop was due to salary cap restrictions. =Penrith Panthers= Civoniceva signed to play for the Penrith Panthers for the 2008 season. The deal was for 2 years with an option for a third and was believed to be worth $370,000 a year. Civoniceva's move to New South Wales and another NRL team rather than relocating to England allowed him to continue to be available to represent both Australia and Queensland. In January 2008, Penrith Panthers announced Civoniceva as captain of the team for 2008. In August 2008, Civoniceva was named in the preliminary 46-man Kangaroos squad for the 2008 Rugby League World Cup, and in October 2008 he was selected in the final 24-man Australia squad. Civoniceva training with the Maroons in 2009 His deal with Penrith was set to expire at the end of the 2009 NRL season. He re-signed with Penrith until the end of 2012.Ritchie, Dean.

Civoniceva was selected for Australia in the one-off test match against New Zealand on 8 May 2009. He went on to play in Queensland's State of Origin victories in game 1 and then game 2, but suffered a season- ending foot injury in the first half of the second match.Civoniceva happy the rowing is over. News.brisbanetimes.com.au (27 October 2009). Retrieved on 5 September 2011. After sitting out the remainder of the NRL season, his next match was for Australia against New Zealand in the opening match of the 2009 Four Nations in London. By playing in the final, a victory against England, Civoniceva became the first forward in history to play forty internationals for Australia. For the 2010 ANZAC Test, Civoniceva was selected to play for Australia as a prop forward in their victory against New Zealand. In the 2010 NRL Premiership, Civoniceva led the Panthers to second place on the ladder at the conclusion of the season, but in the penultimate round of the season he was sent off for a high tackle against the Bulldogs which resulted in him being suspended for two weeks. As a result, he missed Penrith's first qualifying final, where despite a brave effort the Panthers lost by just two points against the Canberra Raiders. In Round 5 of the 2011 NRL season, Civoniceva scored his first try since Round 8, 2008, against the Canberra Raiders in the 36‚Äì10 thrashing at Centrebet Stadium. He was one of the stars of Queensland's victory in Origin 1, 2011, running for more than 150m and outperforming the NSW forwards. Civoniceva scored his second try of the season in Round 16 against the North Queensland Cowboys, which was a 30‚Äì20 victory by the Panthers. The try involved a skilful left foot step from close range that left several Cowboys players, including Matthew Bowen, grasping at thin air. This was the Women in League round, and also the rookie coach, Steve Georgallis' first game as coach for the Penrith Panthers. Civoniceva's stint at Penrith ended on a low, with the Panthers failing to qualify for the semi- finals, and thrashed by the St. George Illawarra Dragons, 32‚Äì12, at Round 26. Civoniceva also succumbed to a torn pectoral muscle injury during the 22nd minute of the game. =Return to Brisbane= On 26 July 2011, it was announced that the Penrith Panthers released Civoniceva from the final year of his contract, within the week, it was announced that he had signed to return to his original club, the Brisbane Broncos on a one-year deal. On 8 May 2012, Civoniceva announced his retirement effective at the conclusion of the 2012 season. Civoniceva was selected to play for Queensland in the 2012 State of Origin series. During the 2012 NRL season Civoniceva became the 17th player in premiership history to play 300 games. The third and deciding match of the 2012 State of Origin series, a Maroons victory which sealed an unprecedented seventh consecutive series for Queensland, was Civoniceva's last. Played at Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium, it featured a post-match farewell speech for Civoniceva. Civoniceva announced he would play for the Redcliffe Dolphins in the Queensland Cup during the 2013 season.Petero Civoniceva to return for boyhood club The Press, 5 November 2012 At the end of the year he was selected to travel to the United Kingdom and represent Fiji, the country of his birth, in the 2013 Rugby League World Cup. In May 2014, Petero played for Fiji in the 2014 Pacific Rugby League International. He was a late inclusion into the side, he wore the no.18 playing jersey. Later on in the year, Petero became an assistant coach, assisting main coach Rick Stone.

Denia and its associated neighborhoods capture the southernmost part of Haifa's jurisdiction area, which is also the highest-elevated topographically, and make up the city's altogether most affluent and least densely populated residential borough, with a population count of slightly more than 11,000 in 2008.Secretary of the City of Haifa, Haifa Neighborhood Profile , June 2010, p. 327 It lies approximately 5 kilometers in a beeline from downtown Haifa (whereas twisting roads due to intervening hills and wadis make actual distance bigger) and is crossed by Aba Hushi Avenue, which has made the district sometimes be referred to as the \\"Aba Hushi Axis\\". It is bordered by Nesher to the east, Nave Sha'anan to northeast, Ahuza to the north, Tirat Carmel to the west and the Mount Carmel National Park, among which portions of Hof HaCarmel Regional Council are interspersed, to the south. The University of Haifa's main campus, with its identifiable Eshkol Tower, is located in the borough. As early as the 1930s there were attempts made to develop the then-empty area, which was rugged and wildly wooded, as a part of the Yishuv's strains of extending Haifa southwards whilst exercising environmental and landscape values - which later led to the declaration of the Carmel Park, bordered by the district.  Name  The first houses were built by the Danya Cebus infrastructure company, and the first word in the company's name was commonly adopted by the neighborhood; however, the first street, which was named Denia Street, was later decided to be rather attributed to Denmark ‚Äì in Hebrew sometimes called Danya, and many of the roads whose construction followed also received names of countries and cities with significance to Haifa or to Israel, such as Finland Street, Costa Rica Street and Hague Street.  Denia A and Denia B  Denya B The original kernel of Denia, in official references sometimes appearing as \\"Hod HaCarmel\\", was established in the early 1960s, to the west of Road 672 which connects Haifa with Daliyat al-Karmel (later named Aba Hushi Avenue), and the new neighborhood was actually so remote that it had no built-area continuity with any other existing community. The failed initial prospect to draw military officers as residents was replaced by the explicit attempt of creating a millionaire-suburbia at the forest's threshold, giving rise to the city's wealthy families starting to buy the exceptionally large lots on which ambitiously designed properties were built, frontaged by spectacular gardening. In 1971, a decade after the plan for the first neighborhood was made, the authorities gave a green light to a part-two to be built westward down the same ridge extension. This later neighborhood, consisting overwhelmingly of duplexes and houses with backyard swimming pools, is the most secluded of neighborhoods, with the older Denia (now known as \\"Aleph\\") as a sole access to and from the main road. The extreme-western houses coincide Tirat Carmel; however, the residents have objected the suggested construction of a road that would connect them with that low-rated town. Surrounded by lush wadi gorges from three directions, Denia Beth has a country club and a considerable share of its population are employees of the IT research and development centres of southern Haifa. As of the 2000s, demographic data suggest that Denia A's inhabitant mean age is one of the higher in the borough and in Haifa. Denia A and B share a small commercial centre, as well as a community centre and a public library.  Ramat Golda and Ramat Almogi  The cluster of neighborhoods that constitute the greater Denia also in many senses includes the twin-communities of Ramat Golda (\\"Golda Height\\") and Ramat Almogi (\\"Almogi Height\\") ‚Äì named respectively after Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir and Haifa mayor Yosef Almogi. Ramat Golda, the older of the two, was built mainly during the 1980s, adjacent to Road 672, and is appreciated for its unobstructed westward view to the Mediterranean Ocean. Parallelly stretching on the eastern bank of the highway, the construction of Ramat Almogi was commenced in mid-1990s and has continued into the 21st century, with more multiple-tenant units and condominiums, rare to Denia's older parts. It typically attracts younger families.  Ramat Aba Hushi  Haifa University located in the south-east of Denia With its denomination as \\"Aba Hushi Height\\", at 470 meters above sea level this area of about 1.5 kilometers north-south along the main artery is today home to the campus of the Haifa University. Back in the early 70s, when the area of the Carmal National Park had just been demarcated by the state leaving the outlines of Haifa's jurisdiction sharply coinciding the newly built Denia, it was then-mayor Aba Hushi who managed to redeem a narrow strip from the park-assigned woodland on Mount Tlalim back into within the city's borders, and expropriated it from its recreational designation in order to found Haifa's second university (the first being the Technion in Nave Sha'anan). Today, this section is mainly a commuting hub for the over 17,000 students and staff as well as citizens frequenting the various amenities, such as Israel's biggest academic library, with only residents being the students who stay at the dorms at the campus‚Äô southeastern tip. To the north of the campus is IBM Haifa Research Laboratory.  Savionei Denia  Savionei Denia (\\"Denia Ragwort\\") is one of Haifa's very few residential tower neighborhoods, as well as one of the city's newest, with prestige highrises that have been erected east of the Aba Hushi thoroughfare since the 1990s onwards. The buildings, with large apartments overlooking the Haifa Bay, are set on a steep forest slope that has been heavily thinned out, north of the university, and those of them that reach farther east are eventually met by the identical tower blocks of the city of Nesher.  Schools  Pupils from the borough are regularly registered for the Albert Einstein Elementary School, which is situated just at the border of Ramat Almogi and Ahuza; and for the Rothschild‚ÄìAliance High School, near the border with Nave Sha'anan. The Albert Einstein Elementary School was founded in 1977. It has 545 students enrolled in grades 1-6, with teaching team that includes 33 teachers and 4 administrators. The school contains a library, computer lab, English training lab, mathematics lab, gym and science laboratory. The school is central part of the local community and is the site of annual gatherings and festivals as well as the local Independence Day festival. The Ministry of Education and the local municipality regulate the school's curriculum and provide it with administrative support. During the wave of migrants from the former Soviet Union to Israel in 1990-1993, the Einstein school was pivotal in absorbing new migrant children in the southern neighbourhoods of Haifa.

This 1831 cartoon ridiculing Clay's American System depicts monkeys, labeled as being different parts of a nation's economy, stealing each other's resources (food) with commentators describing it as either great or a humbug. The American System was an economic plan that played an important role in American policy during the first half of the 19th century. Rooted in the \\"American School\\" ideas of Alexander Hamilton, the plan \\"consisted of three mutually reinforcing parts: a tariff to protect and promote American industry; a national bank to foster commerce; and federal subsidies for roads, canals, and other 'internal improvements' to develop profitable markets for agriculture\\".Classic Senate Speeches: Henry Clay In Defense of the American System at the U.S. Senate website Congressman Henry Clay was the plan's foremost proponent and the first to refer to it as the \\"American System\\". History A plan to strengthen and unify the nation, the American System, was advanced by the Whig Party and a number of leading politicians including Henry Clay and John Quincy Adams. Motivated by a growing American economy bolstered with major exports such as cotton, tobacco, native sod, and tar they sought to create a structure for expanding trade. This System included such policies as: * Support for a high tariff to protect American industries and generate revenue for the federal government * Maintenance of high public land prices to generate federal revenue * Preservation of the Bank of the United States to stabilize the currency and rein in risky state and local banks * Development of a system of internal improvements (such as roads and canals) which would knit the nation together and be financed by the tariff and land sales Clay protested that the West, which opposed the tariff, should support it since urban factory workers would be consumers of western foods. In Clay's view, the South (which also opposed high tariffs) should support them because of the ready market for cotton in northern mills. This last argument was the weak link. The South never strongly supported the American System and had access to plenty of markets for its cotton exports. Portions of the American System were enacted by the United States Congress. The Second Bank of the United States was rechartered in 1816 for 20 years. High tariffs were first suggested by Alexander Hamilton in his 1791 Report on Manufactures but were not approved by Congress until the Tariff of 1816. Tariffs were subsequently raised until they peaked in 1828 after the so-called Tariff of Abominations. After the Nullification Crisis in 1833, tariffs remained the same rate until the Civil War. However, the national system of internal improvements was never adequately funded; the failure to do so was due in part to sectional jealousies and constitutional squabbles about such expenditures. In 1830, President Jackson rejected a bill which would allow the federal government to purchase stock in the Maysville, Washington, Paris, and Lexington Turnpike Road Company, which had been organized to construct a road linking Lexington and the Ohio River, the entirety of which would be in the state of Kentucky. Jackson's Maysville Road veto was due to both his personal conflict with Clay and his ideological objections. Main points The establishment of a protective tariff, a 20%‚Äì25% tax on imported goods, would protect a nation's business from foreign competition. Congress passed a tariff in 1816 which made European goods more expensive and encouraged consumers to buy relatively cheap American-made goods. The establishment of a national bank would promote a single currency, making trade easier, and issue what was called sovereign credit, i.e., credit issued by the national government, rather than borrowed from the private banking system. In 1816, Congress created the Second Bank of the United States. The improvement of the country's infrastructure, especially transportation systems, made trade easier and faster for everyone. Poor roads made transportation slow and costly. The American System became the leading tenet of the Whig Party of Henry Clay and Daniel Webster. It was opposed by the Democratic Party of Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, James K. Polk, Franklin Pierce, and James Buchanan prior to the Civil War, often on the grounds that the points of it were unconstitutional. Among the most important internal improvements created under the American System was the Cumberland Road.

It is the third film directed by Gray, and the second to feature Phoenix and Wahlberg together, the first being 2000's The Yards. The title comes from the motto of the NYPD's Street Crimes Unit, which disbanded in 2002. The film premiered May 25, at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. It was released October 12, 2007 in the United States and Canada. It was released in the United Kingdom on December 14, 2007 and in Australia on February 28, 2008. Plot In 1988 Brooklyn, New York, Bobby Green (Joaquin Phoenix) is the manager of the El Caribe nightclub in Brighton Beach, which is frequented by Russian mobster and drug lord Vadim Nezhinski (Alex Veadov) and owned by Vadim's uncle Marat Buzhayev (Moni Moshonov). Bobby has distanced himself from his father, NYPD Deputy Chief Burt Grusinsky (Robert Duvall), and his brother, Captain Joseph Grusinsky (Mark Wahlberg). Bobby uses his mother's maiden name, Green, as his last name and stays on the sidelines enjoying a hedonistic life with his girlfriend Amada Juarez (Eva Mendes) and best friend Louis \\"Jumbo\\" Falsetti (Danny Hoch). When Joseph leads a police raid on El Caribe in hope of arresting Vadim, Bobby refuses to cooperate. The incident strains Bobby's relationship with his father and brother even more, and Bobby and Joseph come to blows. The police are unsuccessful in making a case against Vadim, who decides to retaliate. The next evening, Joseph is shot by a masked assailant and his unmarked police cruiser is firebombed. Joseph survives the ambush and is hospitalized for four months. Vadim, unaware of Bobby's family ties, confides that the Chief will be the next victim. Bobby resolves to help the police and, without his father's knowledge, goes undercover inside Vadim's cocaine-smuggling operation with a police listening device hidden in a cigarette lighter. The device is discovered and Bobby narrowly escapes being murdered as the police raid the operation and arrest Vadim. Bobby and Amada are placed in protective police custody and their relationship begins to deteriorate. When Vadim escapes custody while being transported to a hospital, Burt and the police prepare to move Bobby and Amada to a new location. During a torrential rainstorm the police convoy is intercepted by Vadim's men, and during a chaotic car chase Burt is fatally shot. When he sees his father's body, Bobby blacks out in the rain. The police take Bobby and Amada back to their motel near Kennedy Airport. Bobby wakes up a few hours later and finds Joseph in the motel room. Joseph tells him that their father has been shot and killed. At the funeral, a colleague of Joseph's, Captain Jack Shapiro (Tony Musante), gives him Burt's Korean War medal. Bobby is told that a Russian shipment of cocaine is arriving sometime in the coming week. To avenge his father, Bobby decides to officially join the police force without the consent of Amada, who leaves him. After he is sworn into the NYPD, Bobby learns the true involvement of Jumbo and Marat. He and Joseph organize a final sting operation, set for April 4, 1989. During the raid, Joseph is emotionally incapacitated by the memory of his shooting and cannot continue. Vadim flees into the reed beds, and the police toss in flares to smoke him out. As the beds are engulfed in flame and smoke, Bobby runs in to find Vadim himself, ignoring the other officers' pleas that he wait. Bobby shoots Vadim in the chest, mortally wounding him. Nearly a year after the raid on El Caribe, Bobby, now in uniform, graduates from the NYPD Police Academy to become a full-time police officer. Before the ceremony, Joseph reveals to Bobby that he has decided to switch to a job in the administration sector, since the shooting led him to realize that he needs to spend more time with his children. As the chaplain announces that Bobby is to give the valedictorian address, Bobby thinks he sees Amada in the audience, but it turns out to be an illusion. Bobby and Joseph express their brotherly love. Cast Reception on Rotten Tomatoes, 57% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 150 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10.

It ran for 38 episodes, from October 4, 2000 to June 27, 2001, on the TV Tokyo network and its affiliates. Overview Gear Fighter Dendoh tells the story of two Japanese schoolboys‚Äîshort-tempered Ginga Izumo and level-headed Hokuto Kusanagi‚Äîwho meet each other one day, only a few minutes before the Earth is attacked by Galfa (sometimes translated as Gulfer or Garufa), a race of sentient machines determined to wipe out all life in the universe. In the midst of this chaos, the two are chosen by Dendoh, a giant robot built to battle Galfa, to be its pilots, causing them to become members of the Guard Earth and Advanced Reconnaissance organization designated with the protection of Earth from the Galfa advance. The two young pilots find themselves in a race to obtain the powerful and animal-like Data Weapons before Galfa can get their hands on them. The show is directed and plotted by Mitsuo Fukuda and his wife, Chiaki Morosawa, the duo who went on to create Mobile Suit Gundam SEED and its sequel Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny. Notably, Morosawa was not sole head scriptwriter for Dendoh, instead sharing duties with Yasuko Kobayashi, who went on to be the head writer for Toei's Kamen Rider Ryuki, Kamen Rider Den-O, and Samurai Sentai Shinkenger.

He took part in the Franco- Prussian War, suffering the loss of his lower right arm. By 1903, he had reached the rank of General, but he retired from active service in 1911. He was offered the position of Army Chief of Staff by War Minister Adolphe Messimy, but was removed from consideration due to his anti-republican political views and his insistence on the authority to personally nominate generals for high commands. The position instead passed to Joseph Joffre, who would become the French commander-in-chief during World War I. When war broke out in 1914, General Joffre recalled Pau from retirement to command the Army of Alsace to participate in the attacks towards Alsace called for by Plan XVII. The Army of Alsace contained VII Corps (which had taken but failed to hold Mulhouse between 7 and 10 August), 44th Division, the 55th Reserve Division, the 8th Cavalry Division and the 1st Group of Reserve Divisions (58th, 63rd and 66th Reserve divisions). Although initially successful, Pau was forced to withdraw after the defeat of the First Army at Morhange- Sarrebourg. When it was clear to Joffre that French hopes for a quick victory in Alsace had faded and that France now faced the real possibility of quick defeat (caused by the Schlieffen Plan), Pau's army was broken up and sent north to join Maunoury's Sixth Army in time to participate in the First Battle of the Marne. After this, Pau was not given another field command. After serving in the French Supreme War Council, he was sent in January 1916 as French representative to the Russian high command, known as the Stavka. Pau also toured Australia in September 1918, meeting Australian veterans, and attending war rallies. He died in Paris in 1932.

The strike began on September 22, 1919, and collapsed on January 8, 1920. The AA had formed in 1876. It was a union of skilled steel and ironworkers which was deeply committed to craft unionism. However, technological advances had slashed the number of skilled workers in both industries. Background left In 1892, the AA had lost a bitter strike at the Carnegie Steel Company's steel mill in Homestead, Pennsylvania. The Homestead strike, which culminated with a day-long gun battle on July 6 that left 10 dead and dozens wounded, led to a wave of de- unionization. From a high of more than 24,000 members in 1892, union membership had sunk to less than 8,000 by 1900. The union attempted to organize workers in the tin industry, but a sudden wave of industry consolidations left the union facing the gigantic U.S. Steel corporation. In the U.S. Steel Recognition Strike of 1901, the union struck the fledgling company and won nearly all its demands. But the union's executive board wanted more and rejected the pact. U.S. Steel was able to muster its resources and break the strike. By the end of World War I, the AA was a shell of its former self. In 1892, The American Federation of Labor (AFL) began organizing unskilled iron and Steelworkers into federal unions in 1901. Local groups of wire drawers, house men, tube workers, blast furnace men and others had all formed unions. The Federal Association of Wire Drawers was chartered in 1896, the Tin Plate Workers' Protective Association in 1899, the International Association of Blast Furnace Workers in 1901, and the International Association of Tube Workers in 1902. Most internationals disbanded after a short time, but many local federal unions became deeply entrenched in the workplace.Brody, 1969, p. 130-132. Insistence on retaining its craft union identity kept it from establishing a stronger presence in the metals industries. The union was in crisis, however. The steel industry was growing quickly, and the skilled jobs in which AA members worked were disappearing. The union had to act in order to save itself. At the November 1909 AFL convention, AA president P.J. McArdle introduced a resolution, which quickly passed, calling for an organizing drive at U.S. Steel. By December, organizers were flooding plants throughout the Northeast and Midwest. But workers remained skittish after the failed 1901 strike, and the drive never got off the ground.Brody, 1969, p. 132-133. right The AFL then attempted to organize workers on the AA's behalf. The AFL's strategy was twofold. First, the federation would wait for a strong upturn in economic conditions. When workers felt less dependence on their employer and showed signs of restiveness, the organization would initiate an organizing effort. Second, the federation would create staff-driven unions run from national AFL headquarters. Samuel Gompers and other AFL leaders had a nativist view of the unskilled immigrants working in steel plants. Distrusting immigrant workers to manage their own affairs, the AFL intended to run unions for them. These assumptions doomed the organizing drive. The AFL did not account for the hardening anti-union attitudes of U.S. Steel executives and plant managers, and the federation had no real plan to counterbalance the vast financial resources the company would pour into anti-union espionage, strikebreaking and union avoidance measures. When the AFL did organize a local union, the federation's patronizing attitudes and management style alienated workers and left the local union powerless.Brody, 1969, p. 140-45. During World War I, the AA saw some limited growth. Inflation pushed restive employees to demand wage increases which the AFL and the AA were quick to claim credit for. But membership growth remained weak and scattered rather than substantive and strategic. To encourage more organizing, the AFL formed a National Committee for Organizing the Iron and Steelworkers. More than 15 AFL unions participated in the committee, while 24 claimed jurisdiction over portions of the steel industry. John Fitzpatrick and William Z. Foster of the Chicago Federation of Labor were the committee's leaders. But the organizing drive was hampered by the refusal of many of the participating unions to provide resources and support, and by the committee's lack of a mechanism to enforce jurisdictional agreements and requisition funds. Although the National Committee had some initial success in establishing local steelworker councils, these councils never received formal recognition from the AFL or the AA.Brody, 1969, p. 199-225; Dubofsky and Dulles, p. 219-20. Strike Labor leader rallying striking Steelworkers in left Shortly after Armistice Day, AFL organizers in and around Pittsburgh began to be harassed by the steel companies: permits for meetings were denied, meeting halls could not be rented (when they were, the local Board of Health closed the hall), Pinkerton agents stopped organizers at the train station and forced them to leave town, and literature was seized. The AFL sought assistance from its political allies, but the harassment continued. The anti- union pressure spread to the Midwest and West. As the post-war recession affected the economy, plant managers targeted union supporters and those with large families for dismissal in order to ensure that union efforts were stifled.Rayback, p. 285-286; Brody, 1969, p. 231-33. The AFL pushed back. On April 1, 1919, thousands of miners in Pennsylvania went on strike to demand that local officials allow union meetings. Terrified town mayors soon issued the required permits. The mass meetings whipped up pro-union sentiment. Steelworkers felt betrayed by the broken promises of employers and the government to keep prices low, raise wages and improve working conditions. The AFL held a national steelworkers' conference in Pittsburgh on May 25, 1919, to build momentum for an organizing drive but refused to let the workers strike. Disillusioned employees began to abandon the labor movement. The National Committee debated the strike issue through June and July. Worried committee members, seeing their chance for solid membership gains slipping away, agreed to a strike referendum in the mills in August. The response was 98% in favor of a general steelworker strike to begin on September 22, 1919. right As the strike deadline approached, the National Committee attempted to negotiate with U.S. Steel chairman Elbert Gary. The committee also asked for President Woodrow Wilson's help. Telegrams and letters were sent back and forth, but Gary refused to meet, and Wilson‚Äîon his ill-fated tour to drum up support for the League of Nations‚Äîwas unable to influence the company.Dubofsky and Dulles, p. 220; Rayback, p. 286-87; Brody, 1969, p. 233-36. The steelworkers carried out their strike threat. The September strike shut down half the steel industry, including almost all mills in Pueblo, Colorado; Chicago, Illinois, Wheeling, West Virginia; Johnstown, Pennsylvania; Cleveland, Ohio; Lackawanna, New York; and Youngstown, Ohio. The steel companies had seriously misjudged the strength of worker discontent.Brody, 1969, p. 233-44. But the owners quickly turned public opinion against the AFL. The post-war Red Scare had swept the country in the wake of the Russian revolution of October 1917. The steel companies took eager advantage of the change in the political climate. As the strike began, they published information exposing National Committee co-chairman William Z. Foster's past as a Wobbly and syndicalist, and claimed this was evidence that the steelworker strike was being masterminded by communists and revolutionaries. The steel companies played on nativist fears by noting that a large number of steelworkers were immigrants. Public opinion quickly turned against the striking workers. Only Wilson's stroke on September 26, 1919, prevented government intervention, since Wilson's advisers were loath to take action with the president incapacitated. right The federal government's inaction permitted state and local authorities and the steel companies room to maneuver. Mass meetings were prohibited in most strike- stricken areas. Veterans and tradesmen were pressed into service as deputies. The Pennsylvania state police clubbed picketers, dragged strikers from their homes and jailed thousands on flimsy charges. In Delaware, company guards were deputized and threw 100 strikers in jail on fake weapons charges. In Monessen, Pennsylvania, hundreds of men were jailed then were promised release if they agreed to disavow the union and return to work. After strikebreakers and police clashed with unionists in Gary, Indiana, the U.S. Army took over the city on October 6, 1919, and martial law was declared. National guardsmen, leaving Gary after federal troops had taken over, turned their anger on strikers in nearby Indiana Harbor, Indiana.Rayback, p. 287; Brody, 1969, p. 244-253; Dubofsky and Dulles, p. 220; . Steel companies also turned toward strikebreaking and rumor-mongering to demoralize the picketers. Between 30,000 and 40,000 unskilled African-American and Mexican American workers were brought to work in the mills. Company officials played on the racism of many white steelworkers by pointing out how well-fed and happy the black workers seemed now that they had 'white' jobs. Company spies also spread rumors that the strike had collapsed elsewhere, and they pointed to the operating steel mills as proof that the strike had been defeated.Rayback, p. 287; Dubofsky and Dulles, p. 220-21; Brody, 1969, p. 254-55. The AFL sabotaged the strike in several ways. When the AA demanded that the AFL contribute to strike relief, Gompers sarcastically asked how much money the AA intended to contribute. Few unions on either the National Committee or in the AFL contributed relief funds. As October and November wore on, many AA members crossed the picket lines to return to work. AA affiliates collapsed because of the member infighting this caused. Unions on the National Committee, squabbling over jurisdiction in the steel mills, publicly accused one another of failing to support the strike.Brody, 1969, p. 255-58. The Great Steel Strike of 1919 collapsed on January 8, 1920. The Chicago mills gave in at the end of October. By the end of November, workers were back at their jobs in Gary, Johnstown, Youngstown and Wheeling. The AA, ravaged by the strike and watching its locals collapse, argued with the National Committee for a unilateral return to work. But the National Committee voted to keep the strike going against the union's wishes. The strike dragged on in isolated areas like Pueblo and Lackawanna, but the job action decimated the AA. AA president Michael F. Tighe demanded that the National Committee disband; his motion failed. Tighe withdrew from the National Committee. Absent the union with primary jurisdiction over the steel industry, the National Committee ceased operating.Brody, 1969, p. 258‚Äì62. The steel strike of 1919 had been a complete rout for the American labor movement.  Medias Coverage of the Strike  The Washington Post had written a article which had seemed to have gathered the views of Businessmen on the strike; \\"A week's investigation in the steel district has convinced me that an overwhelming majority of the men engaged in it do not want this strike. I get this viewpoint, not from the steel operators, but from the business men of widely scattered communities, from those who are in daily, intimate and sympathetic contact with the working men and from the working men themselves. I have talked with hundreds of them fact to fact. The strike is artificial from top to bottom it lacks the moral support of the men who are actually on strike, is deplored by those skilled working men who have been thrown out of employment by the strike of the unskilled laborers, and will fall of its own weight if encouragement does not come from high quarters\\". This article would later be brought up in the testimony of Gary, Elbert H in his Testimony before the Committee on Education and Labor of the United States Senate. Impact Almost no union organizing in the steel industry occurred in the next 15 years. Advances in technology, such as the development of the wide strip continuous sheet mill, made most of the skilled jobs in steel making obsolete. When the AA considered calling a national strike in 1929 to demand that the new technology be rejected, nearly every AA affiliate returned its charter to the international rather than obey the strike order. By 1930, the AA had only 8,600 members. Its leadership, burned by failed strikes in 1892, 1901 and 1919, turned accommodationist and submissive.Brody, 1969, p. 277-78; Dubofsky and Dulles, p. 258. The AA, which had only a minor role to play in the steel strike of 1919, remained moribund until the advent of the Steelworkers Organizing Committee in 1936.

He is well known as being a 'niggler' when playing, and has been described as \\"one of the game's most hated players.\\" Playing career =Newcastle Knights= Ennis made his NRL debut for Newcastle in 2003. After a single game in 2003 he played 19 games during the 2004 NRL season for the Knights. =St. George Illawarra Dragons= In the 2005 NRL season's finals series Ennis was kicking goals for the St. George Illawarra Dragons as they went to within one match of the grand final but lost to eventual premiers, the Wests Tigers. =Brisbane Broncos= Ennis playing for the Broncos in 2008 Ennis‚Äôs first season at the Broncos, in 2006, was cut short by a knee injury suffered in round 5 against the South Sydney Rabbitohs at Suncorp Stadium. While changing direction, Ennis snapped his anterior cruciate ligament and required a full knee reconstruction. Ennis missed the rest of the season, and subsequently, the premiership win in October.http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/nrl/teams/sharks/after-coming- close-before-michael-ennis-has-one-last-shot-at-an-nrl-premiership/news- story/42d2d7b0a109992e472cdb550353f770 As 2006 NRL Premiers, the Brisbane Broncos travelled to England to face 2006 Super League champions, St Helens R.F.C. in the 2007 World Club Challenge. Ennis played from the interchange bench in the Broncos' 14-18 loss. In the 2007 NRL season, Ennis made a return to first grade but was forced to work for his place in the side as a result of the good form of Shaun Berrigan at hooker. After some appearances from the interchange bench earlier in the season, Ennis was trialled at halfback during the final stages of Brisbane's round 10 loss to the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. He was retained in this position in the ensuing games with some success. 2008 saw Ennis reach the best form of his time at the Broncos. With stiff competition from recruit PJ Marsh, Ennis cemented a spot as the starting hooker and guided the Broncos to some impressive early victories. In June 2008, Ennis signed a three-year deal to join Canterbury-Bankstown in 2009, joining a list of players to leave the Broncos. This was to be his 4th NRL club at 24 years of age. =Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs= Ennis training with the Bulldogs in 2012. Ennis working for Fox Sports in 2017 Ennis joined the Bulldogs from the Broncos for the 2009 NRL season. He was selected for Country in the City vs Country match on 8 May 2009. Ennis made his State of Origin debut for New South Wales in Game III of the 2009 series, replacing bitter rival Robbie Farah who was dropped. Ennis made an impact in his first game as the Blues won a dead rubber match, 28-16 with Ennis landing three goals from three attempts. At club level, Ennis played 25 games for Canterbury in his first season there as they finished second on the table and qualified for the finals. Ennis played in Canterbury's preliminary final defeat against arch rivals Parramatta at ANZ Stadium. He filled the full-time goal-kicking role at Canterbury-Bankstown in 2010, replacing Hazem El Masri, who retired in 2009. However, he was replaced by specialist Bryson Goodwin. Ennis played in all three games in 2010 State of Origin series, all resulting in losses. In the third match, Ennis was blamed by some for costing NSW victory when he gave away a penalty by punching Queensland's Nate Myles with six minutes to go (NSW at the time were leading 18-13). There have since been calls for Ennis not to play for New South Wales ever again, but, despite this, he was selected for all three games the following series, also lost. In the three-year period from the start of 2008 season, Ennis was penalised in games 58 times, the 2nd most of any player in the NRL behind Anthony Watmough. In 2011, he was penalised 17 times in his 12 appearances. In 2012, he was penalised 20 times in 20 games. In February, 2011, Ennis signed a new three-year contract with Canterbury. Then-coach Kevin Moore said, \\"Mick is the kind of player that any head coach would love to have in his side. He leaves nothing to chance, he's a natural leader, is about the fittest bloke in the team and he gives us outstanding direction on and off the field.\\" Ennis played in 26 games in 2012 as Canterbury won the Minor Premiership. He missed only one game as Canterbury- Bankstown made the 2012 NRL Grand Final against Melbourne. However, he failed to score a try for the year. Canterbury would go on to lose the final 14-4 at ANZ Stadium. Around half way through the 2014 NRL season, Ennis signed on with the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks for what was likely to be the last two years of his career. In Canterbury's Preliminary Final win over Penrith Panthers in September 2014, Ennis suffered a foot injury, ruling him out of the 2014 NRL Grand Final, with the captaincy for the Grand Final passed to James Graham and Trent Hodkinson meaning that Ennis had played his last game for Canterbury- Bankstown. =Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks= In 2015, he joined the Cronulla- Sutherland Sharks. Ennis played in Game 3 of the 2015 State of Origin series as Robbie Farah withdrew due to injury. In the 2015 NRL season, Ennis played 25 games for Cronulla as they qualified for the finals. Ennis played in the club's 39-0 elimination final loss against North Queensland. In 2016, he announced he would retire at the end of the season. He finished the season on a high note, winning the 2016 NRL Grand Final in his last game.

The former is known as Top Dead Centre (TDC) while the latter is known as Bottom Dead Centre (BDC). Position of pistons More generally, the dead centre is any position of a crank where the applied force is straight along its axis, meaning no turning force can be applied. Many sorts of machines are crank driven, including unicycles, bicycles, tricycles, various types of machine presses, gasoline engines, diesel engines, steam locomotives, and other steam engines. Crank-driven machines rely on the energy stored in a flywheel to overcome the dead centre, or are designed, in the case of multi-cylinder engines, so that dead centres can never exist on all cranks at the same time. A steam locomotive is an example of the latter, the connecting rods being arranged such that the dead centre for each cylinder occurs out of phase with the other one (or more) cylinders. Bicycles Bicycle cranks have dead centres at approximately 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock where simple pushing down of the pedal will not turn the chainwheel, but the rider's leg is able to apply tangential force at the pedal to overcome it. Fixed-gear bicycles (without a freehub) use the momentum of the bicycle and rider to keep the chainwheel turning even if the rider makes no attempt to pedal in a circular motion. Reciprocating engine In a reciprocating engine, top dead centre of piston #1 is the point from which ignition system measurements are made and the firing order is determined. For example, ignition timing is normally specified as degrees of crankshaft rotation before top dead centre (BTDC). A very few small and fast-burning engines require a spark just after top dead centre (ATDC), such as the Nissan MA engine with hemispherical combustions, or hydrogen engines. Top dead centre for cylinder one is often marked on the crankshaft pulley, the flywheel or harmonic balancer or both, with adjacent timing marks showing the recommended ignition timing settings as decided during engine development. These timing marks can be used to set the ignition timing either statically by hand or dynamically using a timing light, by rotating the distributor in its seat. In a multi- cylinder engine, pistons may reach top dead centre simultaneously or at different times depending on the engine configuration. For example: * In the V-twin configuration, the two pistons reach TDC at different times, equal to the angular displacement between the cylinders. * In the flat twin configuration, two opposing pistons reach TDC simultaneously, which is also called 0¬∞ displacement - but one piston will be at TDC of the compression stroke, the other on TDC of the exhaust stroke. * In the straight-4 configuration, the two end pistons (pistons 1 and 4) reach TDC simultaneously, as do the two centre pistons (pistons 2 and 3), but these two pairs reach TDC with an angular displacement of 180¬∞. Similar patterns are found in almost all straight engines with even numbers of cylinders, with the two end pistons and two middle pistons moving together (not necessarily 180¬∞ out of phase however) and the intermediate pistons moving in pairs in mirror-image around the centre of the engine. * In the flatplane V8 and many larger V engines, the piston motion within each bank is similar to that of a straight engine, however in the crossplane V8 and all V10 engines the motion is far more complex. The concept of top dead centre is also extended to pistonless rotary engines, and means the point in the cycle in which the volume of a combustion chamber is smallest. This typically occurs several times per rotor revolution; In the Wankel engine for example it occurs three times for every one revolution of the rotor (although only once per revolution of the engine output shaft, since the output rotates at three times the speed of the rotor). Finding the volume of the cylinder using TDC and BDC and multiplying it by the number of cylinders will give the engine displacement. Steam engines As steam engines are commonly horizontal, the relevant terms are front dead centre and back dead centre rather than \\"top\\" and \\"bottom\\". If a single-cylinder steam engine stops in either of the dead centre positions it must be moved off the dead centre before it will restart. In small engines this is done by turning the flywheel by hand. In large engines the flywheel is moved with a lever or \\"turning bar\\". Both operations must be done with care to avoid the operator becoming entangled in the machinery. Even larger engines might require the use of a barring engine. Steam locomotives normally have at least two double acting cylinders, which enables the cranks to be set so that at least one piston will always be off the dead centre and no starting assistance is required. In the common case of a two piston locomotive, the cranks are set at right angles, so that whenever one piston is at dead centre the other is in mid-stroke, and giving four equally spaced power strokes per revolution. Other machines This term is also used in the realm of production equipment. A mechanical punch press employs a crankshaft similar to that found in an engine. In the punch press the crankshaft drives a ram which when it is farthest away from the platen of the press is considered to be in the position of top dead centre.

It is primarily a review of Tropic of Cancer by Henry Miller with Orwell discursing more widely over English literature in the 1920s and 1930s. The biblical story of Jonah and the whale is used as a metaphor for accepting experience without seeking to change it, Jonah inside the whale being comfortably protected from the problems of the outside world. It was published, alongside two other pieces by Orwell, 11 March 1940 by Gollancz in Orwell's first collection of essays, Inside the Whale and Other Essays. Background Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer was published in 1934 by Obelisk Press in Paris.Henry Miller Tropic of Cancer Obelisk Press 1934 Set in France (primarily Paris) during the 1930s, Miller tells of his life as a struggling writer. There are many passages explicitly describing the narrator's sexual encounters, but the book does not solely focus on this subject. Orwell had also lived in Paris for 18 months in 1928 to 1929 and used his experiences to write Down and Out in Paris and London. Orwell had dinner with Henry Miller in Paris in December 1936 when on his way to take part in the Spanish Civil War. Miller gave Orwell a corduroy jacket which was a more suitable outfit for fighting than the blue suit Orwell was wearing.Alfred Perles My Friend Henry Miller Neville Spearman 1955 Structure ;Part 1 Orwell notes that a novel written about American dead-beats cadging drinks in the Latin Quarter of Paris seems an unlikely candidate to be a novel of outstanding value at the time, as its mental atmosphere belongs to the 1920s rather than the 1930s. Orwell is not concerned with the proliferation of 'unprintable words', but is more interested in the way Miller writes about the man in the street. He sees its value not by revealing what is strange, but what is familiar, and in this respect it has much in common with James Joyce in Ulysses. He describes the prose as astonishing. Orwell rejects another popular comparison with C√©line's Journey to the End of the Night which is a book-with-a-purpose, but introduces a comparison with Walt Whitman whose literature is one of \\"acceptance\\" of life as it is rather than a struggle to change it. It is because he is passive to experience that Miller is able to get nearer to the 'ordinary man'. This is out of key with the times when writers had an active involvement in politics and is reflected in the difference between the literature of the Spanish Civil War written by \\"cocksure partisans telling you what to think\\" and that of the Great War literature written by \\"victims\\". ;Part 2 Orwell sets Tropic of Cancer against its literary context with a perusal of literary trends since the First World War. First there is A. E. Housman with nostalgic descriptions of the countryside and adolescent despair in A Shropshire Lad, which Orwell revered as a teenager. After Housman and the nature poets there was a new movement of the 1920s of unrelated writers with a similar outlook such as Joyce, Eliot, Pound, Lawrence, Wyndham Lewis, Aldous Huxley and Lytton Strachey. These were noted by their pessimistic outlook and lack of interest in politics in the narrower sense. In the 1930s writing took on a serious purpose with the W. H. Auden and Stephen Spender group including Cecil Day-Lewis and Christopher Isherwood. Orwell saw a Boy scout leader type of proselytising from this group which consisted of people from an almost identical public school‚Äìuniversity‚ÄìBloomsbury background. Orwell notes the left-leaning tendency of this group and its fascination with communism. Describing the communist as a Russian publicity agent, Orwell seeks an explanation for this. In addition to the common ground of anti-fascism he sees that after the debunking of Western civilisation and the disappearance of traditional middle class values and aspirations, people need something to believe in and Communism has replaced Catholicism as the escapist ideal. Orwell identifies another factor which is the softness and security of life in England against which the secret police and summary executions are too remote. He cites Cyril Connolly in Enemies of Promise for whom the key eventful period in his life was his public school education ‚Äì \\"five years in a lukewarm bath of snobbery\\". As an adjunct Orwell notes that what really frightened him about the Spanish Civil War was how these people adopted the mental attitudes of the Great War in support of their cause. ;Part 3 For Orwell, Miller is a writer who gets away from being a political animal. His passivity is illustrated by his declaration that Orwell's plan to go to Spain was \\"the act of an idiot\\". Miller used the analogy of Jonah and the Whale to apply to Ana√Øs Nin, and this is taken up by Orwell as describing the final unsurpassable stage of irresponsibility. Referring again to the great war Orwell notes the surviving readable works are those written from a passive negative angle and he highlights Prufrock by T. S. Eliot. Miller's is a human voice among bomb explosions. Orwell predicts the break-up of laissez-faire capitalism and of the liberal-Christian culture and suggests that any novel worth reading will have to follow the lines of Miller's work.

Reception Andy Croft has noted that in its coverage of 1930s British literature, \\"Inside the Whale\\" ignores women writers active in that period (such as Rebecca West and Naomi Mitchison) as well as working class writers such as Walter Greenwood, thus creating a misleading impression that the period was dominated by the work of middle-class male writers like Auden.Andy Croft, Red Letter Days : British fiction in the 1930s. London : Lawrence & Wishart, 1990. (pp. 17‚Äì29) Janet Montefiore strongly criticized \\"Inside the Whale\\" in her book Men and Women Writers of the 1930s : the dangerous flood of history. Montefiore states that \\"Inside the Whale\\" is \\"clear, vigorous and well-written: it is also aggressive, misleading and full of holes\\", and claims that \\"Inside the Whale\\" and Virginia Woolf's essay \\"The Leaning Tower\\" are responsible for creating an inaccurate view of 1930s literature.Janet Montefiore, Men and women writers of the 1930s : the dangerous flood of history. London : Routledge, 1996. (pp.13‚Äì18). Montefiore argues Orwell misreads Auden's poem Spain: 1937, claiming that the poem's phrase \\"necessary murder\\" refers to the horrors of war rather than Orwell's view of it as referring to political assassinations. Montefiore also disputes Orwell's view that British writers of the time had comfortable lives, pointing out that both Storm Jameson and Naomi Mitchison worked to help European victims of fascism, and that Christopher Isherwood and his partner had to live in exile because of their homosexuality. Montefiore argues that \\"Inside the Whale\\" \\"anticipates Cold War condemnations of \\"premature anti-fascists\\"\\" by regarding all the left-wing writers of the period \\"as uniform tools or stooges of Moscow\\".

It was formed by the CIO (Congress of Industrial Organizations) on June 7, 1936. It disbanded in 1942 to become the United Steel Workers of America. Early union organizing in steel A wide variety of unions had formed in the brand-new steel industry in the 1900s. Local steel unions formed in steel mills here and there, but no national organization existed. The Long Depression of 1873‚Äì79 forced a number of unions to merge in order to survive. In 1876, the Sons of Vulcan (a puddlers union), the Iron and Steel Heaters Union (a union of workers who operated roughing and rolling machines, and who acted as catchers for still- hot rolled steel), the Iron and Steel Roll Hands Union (another union of roughers, rollers and catchers) and the Nailers Union (riveters) merged to form the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers (the AA).Brody, 1969, p. 52; Foner, p. 218. The AA was a founding member of the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions (FOTLU) and its successor, the American Federation of Labor (AFL).Dubofsky and Dulles, p. 145-46; Krause, p. 289. While the AA had a good degree of success organizing steel workers, it also had some significant failures. In 1892, the union fought and lost the Homestead strike, which nearly bankrupted the union and cost it a majority of its members. It attempted a recognition strike at U.S. Steel in 1901, which also failed and cost the union most of its members in that influential company. It engaged in a strike in 1919 for which it was ill-prepared and which was broken during the Red Scare. AFL attempts to organize in steel By mid-1933, the AA was almost moribund. Union president Michael F. Tighe, 76, was referred to as \\"Grandmother\\" due to his advanced age and timidity,Phelan, p. 100; Brody, \\"Origins...,\\" 1987, p. 15-16; Schlesinger, p. 395; Marshall, 1936. and he suspended locals that called for aggressive action.Phelan, p. 100; Marshall, 1936; Rose, 2001. The Steel Labor Relations Board was created on June 28, 1934. Passage of the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) on June 16, 1933, sparked widespread union organizing throughout the country, even in the steel industry.See, generally, Pacchioli, 1999; Rose, 2001. The AA's membership rose to more than 150,000 by February 1934 (although most had not become dues-paying members).Brody, \\"Origins...,\\" 1987, p. 16. Although most historians claim AA membership was only 50,000 in February 1934, Brody points out that record-keeping in the AA headquarters had broken down due to lack of funds and that the 150,000 number is a better estimate. In 1934, an opposition group known as the Rank and File Movement formed within the AA. A number of militant local affiliates had sprung up across the nation or had joined existing lodges in large enough numbers to elect their own, militant leaders. The locals coalesced into the Rank and File Movement and challenged the conservative leadership to act, demanding that the AA reorganize along industrial union lines.Brody, \\"Origins...,\\" 1987, p. 16; Phelan, p. 100; Rose, 2001; Staughton Lynd, \\"The Possibility of Radicalism in the Early 1930s: The Case of Steel,\\" Radical America 6 (Nov.-Dec. 1972), p. 36-35. At its annual convention in San Francisco in October 1934, the AFL called for an organizing campaign in the steel industry. As early as 1926, AFL president William Green had convinced the federation's executive council to re-establish federal labor unions (FLUs) as a compromise between workers' desires to belong to an industrial union and the jurisdictional rights of existing AFL affiliates. The FLU had been one of Samuel Gompers' favorite recruiting devices. All workers in a plant were recruited into a single union. Theoretically, after organizing in an industry was complete, the FLUs would be broken up and the workers parceled out to the appropriate craft union. Although a number of AFL affiliates protested the use of FLUs, Green put them off ‚Äî declaring that the FLUs were but temporary organizing devices.Zieger, 22‚Äì23; Phelan, p. 79-81. The AFL seemed committed to organizing with FLUs, and to organizing the steel industry. Between 1932 and 1934, the number of FLUs had risen to 1,798 from 307.Dubofsky and Dulles, p. 253; Phelan, p. 101; Rayback, 328-29. But no organizing drive in steel emerged. The AFL executive council meeting in January 1935 considered organizing steel workers into FLUs, but only Green and two other vice presidents supported the plan. Green pointed out to the council that the AA had no resources to organize new members, and was philosophically opposed to organizing any but skilled workers. But the council refused to authorize an AFL-led organizing drive. Instead, the council voted to initiate a joint organizing drive similar to the failed 1919 campaign.Phelan, p. 100-101. Green's supporters were John L. Lewis of the United Mine Workers and David Dubinsky of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union. Green dared not refuse the AFL executive council's instructions to undertake a joint organizing drive, but he did not wholeheartedly implement a plan, either. For the first six months of the year, Green did nothing. After the creation of the federal Steel Labor Relations Board in late June 1935 (an independent labor relations board created by President Franklin D. Roosevelt because of the failures of the National Labor Board), Green worked with Tighe, steel industry executives and the steel board to create a plan to allow collective bargaining in the steel industry. The talks dragged on through the end of the year. The sticking point was the AFL's demand for representational exclusivity (the concept that if a majority of workers voted for the union then all employees in the bargaining unit should belong to the union). By early 1935, what little organizing the AA had exhibited in the steel industry melted away. Continued pressure by the steel companies‚Äîincluding the widespread establishment of company unions, the use of violence, spies and unwarranted dismissal‚Äîhad decimated the AA's membership.Between 1933 and 1937, the four largest steel manufacturers in the U.S. had purchased more tear gas and nauseating gas than the United States government. Phelan, p. 103. When the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the NIRA on constitutional ground on May 27, 1935,The decision which struck down the NIRA was Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, (1935). the organizing drive collapsed. Tighe reported to the AFL in May 1935 that his membership stood at 8,600. At the AFL's convention in Atlantic City in October 1935, the executive council issued a report in which it claimed it had not been \\"advisable to launch an organizing campaign for the steel industry\\" in the previous year.Brody, \\"Origins...,\\" 1987, p. 16; Zieger, p. 35. AFL executive council report is cited in Rayback, p. 349. See also, generally, Pacchioli, 1999; and Rose, 2001. Establishment of SWOC Other events swiftly overtook the AA. The National Labor Relations Act was signed into law by President Roosevelt on July 5, 1935. Committee for Industrial Organization (CIO) formed within the AFL on November 8, 1935. The AFL had long resisted industrial unionism, but the changing nature of work and the American economy were draining the AFL of members and inhibiting organizing.Zieger, p. 23-24. Under the leadership of John L. Lewis, the United Mine Workers of America (UMW) had rapidly expanded its membership. It had even gained a foothold in the so-called \\"captive mines\\"‚Äîthose mines owned and operated by the steel industry to provide coke and coal for steel production. So long as the steel industry remained nonunion, pressure could be put on the captive mines to stay nonunion. And throughout the country, coal operators were using the competitive advantage of the captive mines to stonewall the UMW.Zieger, p. 24-25. CIO efforts to woo the AA Lewis and the CIO did not wish to leave the AFL. In order to avoid antagonizing the AFL but eager to begin an organizing drive in steel along industrial union lines, the CIO resolved to work through the AA instead.Brody, \\"Origins...,\\" 1987, p. 20; Zieger, p. 29-33; Phelan, p. 129-142. The CIO first attempted to push a steelworker industrial organizing plan through the January 1936 AFL executive council meeting. The CIO proposed raising $500,000 toward a $1 million goal to fund the organizing drive. The CIO also requested a jurisdictional waiver, so that skilled workers could be assigned to the AA and while other workers joined a new industrial steelworkers union. The executive council rejected the plan and demanded that the CIO disband. To maintain the pretense of action, the executive council then passed a resolution instructing Green to come up with his own organizing plan for the steel industry.Rayback, p. 350; Phelan, p. 135; Zieger, p. 35. Green's March 2, 1936 plan relied on a joint organizing committee and needed $750,000 in start-up costs alone. Only five of the AFL's 110 unions responded favorably, contributing but $8,625 and five organizers. The CIO then attempted to subvert the AA from within. If the AA changed its mind about organizing along industrial lines, Green and the AFL‚Äîwhich above all else respected each member union's autonomy‚Äîcould do little to prevent the organizing campaign. The CIO approached President Tighe on April 15 and asked to speak to delegates at the AA's convention, but Tighe refused to say whether he would permit a CIO address. Fewer than 100 delegates gathered at the AA's convention in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, on April 28, 1936. Tighe locked the doors of the convention hall to keep the CIO officials out. Tighe then asked the members to vote on whether they wished to hear the CIO offer. The delegates voted 42 to 43 (with seven abstentions) to refuse to hear the proposal. But the CIO found a way to end-run the AA leadership. When the Pennsylvania State Federation of Labor sent a delegation to deliver greetings to the AA, the delegation included John Brophy, the newly hired organizing director of the CIO. Tighe initially refused him entrance, but was forced to give Brophy access under pressure from the delegates. In his remarks, Brophy explained the offer of the CIO: $500,000 for the organization of the steel industry, provided the campaign occurred along industrial lines. A motion was made and carried to appoint a committee to study the proposal.Phelan, p. 135-136; See also, generally, Marshall, 1936. Tighe remained uncertain as to what course to take. He sent AA international secretary Louis Leonard to consult with Green at Green's home in Coshocton, Ohio. Green countered the CIO offer with a pledge of 35 organizers and an undetermined amount of money. Leonard then met Lewis on June 3 in Washington, D.C. Lewis made it clear that the CIO would move ahead with an organizing drive in the steel industry with or without the AA.Phelan, p. 136. Leonard met with the AA executive board the following day. The AA officials accepted the CIO proposal. They voted to affiliate with the CIO, and a memorandum was drafted which established the AA as an administrative unit within the CIO's steelworker organizing committee. Subsequently, the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC) was formed in Pittsburgh on June 7, 1936.Phelan, p. 136; Brody, \\"Origins...,\\" 1987, p. 21. Green was outraged. He denounced what he saw as the takeover of the AA on June 5, and declared that the CIO steelworker organizing drive would fail. More importantly, however, Green interpreted the move as proof that the CIO was engaging in dual unionism. After specious charges were drawn up and an illegal trial conducted, the AFL suspended the 10 unions which belonged to the CIO‚Äîthe AA among them.Phelan, p. 136-142. Structure of SWOC SWOC's internal structure was dictated in most ways by the agreement with the AA. The AA gave SWOC the constitutional legitimacy it needed in order to function as a union. The AA remained inactive except for issuing charters and the approval of contracts for existing lodges. The AA authorized SWOC to handle all matters regarding organizing and to negotiate contracts on behalf of new locals. The only provision for internal governance was that the chairman of the CIO was empowered to appoint a director for SWOC and a policy committee.Brody, \\"Origins...,\\" 1987, p. 26; Zieger, p. 36-37. Half the members of the governing policy committee were drawn from CIO unions, half from SWOC staff. Four of the committee's eight members came from the Mine Workers, two from the AA, and one each from the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America and the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union. The committee met infrequently and at the pleasure of the director of SWOC, and served to rubber-stamp the director's actions. For all intents and purposes, the AA ceased to exist and function after it was subsumed by SWOC. Philip Murray was appointed director of SWOC, and ran the organization (and union) until his death. Murray oversaw a $500,000 budget and 36 organizers.Zieger, p. 37. The number of organizers eventually swelled to more than 200. Organizing successes SWOC had a major success on March 2, 1937, when the union signed a collective bargaining agreement with U.S. Steel. SWOC effectively infiltrated the employer's company unions and turned the unions against the employer. Green denigrated the contract for not achieving a closed shop.Zieger, p. 38-39, 44, 54‚Äì65; Rayback, p. 351-52; Phelan, p. 144. SWOC suffered its first defeat when it attempted to organize the 186,000 workers laboring for \\"Little Steel\\"‚ÄîRepublic Steel, Bethlehem Steel, Youngstown Sheet and Tube, National Steel, Inland Steel and American Rolling Mills. Worker sentiment for a strike was strong, leading to a walkout in 1937 but SWOC was financially exhausted and had not adequately planned for a protracted dispute. Unlike U.S. Steel, the companies of Little Steel were willing to use violence, espionage and large numbers of strikebreakers to crush the union. The worst incidence of violence occurred in Chicago Illinois, when 10 people were killed and 30 wounded during the Memorial Day Massacre.White, p. 130-225; Zieger, p. 38-39, 44, 54‚Äì65; Rayback, p. 351-52; Phelan, p. 144. At least six other people, all union members or supporters, were killed before the strike ended later that summer White, p. 230-231. The AA‚Äîand SWOC‚Äîhad a role in the most important labor relations court case of the modern era. During SWOC's attempt to organize Jones and Laughlin Steel in 1936, the company summarily fired hundreds of union supporters. SWOC filed an unfair labor practice against the company and won. Republic Steel appealed in court, alleging that the National Labor Relations Act was unconstitutional. But in National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, 301 U.S. 1 (1937), the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the NLRA. SWOC inspired a number of similarly- structured organizing committees in the CIO. But none of these were as successful as SWOC.Zieger, p. 75, 80. Organizing slowed after the initial burst of success. By 1939, SWOC was in debt by $2.5 million. Little Steel continued to strongly resist unionization, establishing company unions and intimidating workers. SWOC made little inroad below the Mason-Dixon line, except for a few beachheads in border states which came about as part of its agreements with U.S. Steel. However, the callous treatment of workers displaced by technological change occasionally helped SWOC organize a plant here or there.Zieger, p. 95, 105‚Äì06, 118, 228‚Äì29. Second wave of success Little Steel capitulated in the spring of 1941. Improving economic conditions had not led to rising salaries, and worker walk-outs involving tens of thousands of employees lashed Bethlehem Steel in New York and Pennsylvania. Long-delayed court rulings forced the company to dismantle its company unions, and most of the company's plants voted for the union by the fall. Huge majorities voted for the union at Youngstown Sheet and Tube and at Inland Steel. Republic Steel quietly signed contracts soon thereafter, and the union expanded its membership at U.S. Steel. Wage increases in the contracts averaged 10 percent a year. Once only an organization which existed solely on paper, SWOC now had more members than the Mine Workers.Zieger, p. 124-25, 139. SWOC had had little success at the historically important Homestead mill. But in April 1941, after layoffs sparked renewed interest in the union, U.S. Steel signed a contract with SWOC. It marked the successful return of a union to the plant for the first time since 1892.Zieger, p. 124. In 1940, SWOC director Philip Murray was elected president of the CIO. Disbanding SWOC SWOC and the AA were disbanded at a convention held in Cleveland, Ohio on May 22, 1942. A new organization, the United Steel Workers of America (USWA), was founded. Philip Murray was installed as the new union's president. David J. McDonald was appointed the union's first secretary-treasurer.Dubofsky and Dulles, p. 283. Notes References *Brody, David.

He appeared with the Swiss national team at Euro 2004. After retiring as a player, he moved into management, and is now the manager of FC Luzern. Club career Born in Lausanne, Celestini started playing professionally with hometown's FC Lausanne-Sport, then had a four- season spell in France, spending two years each with Troyes AC and Olympique de Marseille. Whilst with the latter he played the 2004 UEFA Cup final, coming on as a substitute in the second half of the 0‚Äì2 loss to Valencia CF. Celestini moved to Spain in 2004, playing one season with Levante UD. After the team's immediate relegation he stayed in the country, joining fellow La Liga club Getafe CF where he never was an undisputed starter, but managed to feature heavily in consecutive seasons. In 2007‚Äì08, as the Madrid outskirts side reached the quarter-finals in the UEFA Cup, he scored against R.S.C. Anderlecht in a 2‚Äì1 group stage home win. On 16 February 2010, after having been regularly used in the past two seasons, albeit not as a usual first- choice, the 34-year-old Celestini announced he would not renew his contract with Getafe, choosing to return to Lausanne on a one-year deal. However, due to a break in negotiations over his future role at the club after his playing career, he decided to retire before the end of the campaign, playing his last game on 15 December against U.S. Citt√† di Palermo in the Europa League group stage. On 24 March 2015, after a spell as assistant manager at Spanish club M√°laga CF and head coach with Italian amateurs Terracina Calcio 1925, Celestini replaced Marco Simone at Lausanne-Sport in the latter capacity, as the side was in a poor run of results in the Swiss Challenge League. Two months later, he was confirmed in this role for the next three years. In 2015‚Äì16, Celestini led his team back to the Swiss Super League after a two- year absence. On 3 October 2018, he was appointed at FC Lugano in the same division. Just over a year later, he was ousted from his job due to bad results, and replaced by Maurizio Jacobacci. Celestini signed as manager of FC Luzern on 2 January 2020, on a contract until 30 June 2021.

Biography Canuplin was born in Tondo, Manila, but grew up in Divisoria. At age 11, he won \\"best in costume\\" while dressed as Chaplin in a local fair. As his prize, he was employed as a barker at a circus. Soon, he was featured in the circus as a magician's assistant, and he learned to perform magic tricks as well. Canuplin was noticed by the bodabil producer Lou Salvador, Sr. and hired as a Chaplin impersonator. He gained fame performing his Chaplin act and various magic tricks on the Manila bodabil circuit, appearing alongside stars such as Patsy and Bayani Casimiro. He also ventured into such films as Tinig ng Pag-ibig (1940), Luksang Bituin (1941) and Princesa Urduja (1942). One of his most notable roles was as the court jester in the 1941 LVN Pictures production of Ibong Adarna. In many of his films, Canuplin would appear in his Chaplin guise, wordless as was the silent film star. During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, film production was halted and Canuplin returned as a headliner in bodabil. He performed at the Life, Capitol and The Avenue theaters. After the war, he appeared in several other films until the 1950s. Canuplin ended his entertainment career at the bodabil circuit where he remained until its waning years in the sixties. His last years were spent in relative obscurity in Tondo, though still recognized by his peers. After his death, the playwright Manny Pambid wrote a play, Canuplin, on the bodabil star's rise and fall. It was staged by the Philippine Educational Theater Association in May 1980.

N. stenomphalus is very similar to N. pompilius and may in fact represent a subspecies. It is separated by the absence of a thickened callus and the presence of white patches in the umbilical and shoulder regions of the shell. The sheaths of this species have scalloped edges compared with the smooth sheaths of N. pompilius. N. stenomphalus also differs slightly in hood ornamentation. The shell is usually up to around 180 mm in diameter, although the largest specimen ever recorded measured 201 mm.  Distribution  Nautilus stenomphalus are pelagic molluscs belonging to the Nautilidae cephalopod family predominantly found across coral reefs along the Indo-Pacific region.Ward, Peter, Frederick Dooley, and Gregory Jeff Barord. \\"Nautilus: biology, systematics, and paleobiology as viewed from 2015.\\" Swiss Journal of Palaeontology 135.1 (2016): 169-185. N. stenomphalus is specifically known to inhabit the Great Barrier Reef, whereas other members  Description  N. stenomphalus are scavengers that utilize two chemosensory rhinophores, rod-shaped structures located below the eye, to locate dead meat and consuming low-nutrients from the ocean floor. They dwell in darker waters in depths up to 300 meters, though moving towards shallower waters to scavenge at night.Basil, Jennifer, et al. \\"The function of the rhinophore and the tentacles of Nautilus pompilius L.(Cephalopoda, Nautiloidea) in orientation to odor.\\" Marine and Freshwater Behaviour and Physiology 38.3 (2005): 209-221. Though possessing primitive eyes, N. stenomphalus predominantly rely on chemoreception in order to locate food in their habitat. N. stenomphalus share many morphological similarities with its close relative N. pompilius such as ‚Äúzigzag‚Äù shell color pattern  Morphology  = Sexual dimorphism = N. stenomphalus express sexual dimorphism, with mature males predominantly being larger and are significantly more abundant than females.Dunstan, Andrew J., Peter D. Ward, and N. Justin Marshall. \\"Nautilus pompilius life history and demographics at the Osprey Reef Seamount, Coral Sea, Australia.\\" PLOS ONE 6.2 (2011) = Sensory organs = N. stenomphalus possess digital tentacles which are able to detect chemosensation, though its preocular and postocular tentacles are more sensitive and also are believed to function for tactile purposes. When perceiving odor stimulation through its rhinophore, its digital tentacles are often spread out laterally in a ‚Äúcone of search‚Äù to identify the source of the stimulus. Nautilus expresses this distinct pattern of behavior when attempting to locate the source of an odor, swaying its tentacles in a cone shape to detect and move towards the substrate. N. stenomphalus also rely on olfaction through rhinophores, chemosensory structures that are similar to other olfactory organs expressed by other members in the cephalopod family such as Octopus. Rhinophores are situated inside the Nautilus and are exposed to the external environment through pores located below the eyes.  Taxonomy and evolution  Members of the Nautilus genus are believed to have evolved to their current form between seven and ten million years ago, though some estimates place their divergence from their Mesozoic ancestors as early as 40 million years ago.Vandepas, Lauren E., et al. \\"A revisited phylogeography of Nautilus pompilius.\\" Ecology and evolution 6.14 (2016): 4924-4935. Though Nautilus stenomphalus isclassified as an individual species compared to its much more abundant relative Nautilus pompilius, closer DNA analysis of the relationship between N. stenomphalus and N. pompilius reveals that they cannot be identified as independent lineages due to their shared DNA positions and synapomorphies. Moreover, stenomphalus and pompilius hybrid species exhibit less than one percent deviation from the DNA sequences of both parent species. Phylogenetic reconstructions identify both N. stenomphalus and N. pompilius as belonging to the Australian/Papua-New Guinean clade, providing insight that both species may have arose from sympatric speciation.Wray, Charles G., et al. \\"Genetic divergence and geographic diversification in Nautilus.\\" Paleobiology 21.2 (1995): 220-228. Few studies have sought to identify the DNA sequence differences between the species, moreover the genetic distinction of N. stenomphalus and N. pompilius remains unresolved.  Phylogeny  Due to the striking similarities between Nautilus and its subspecies from their identical DNA sequence sections and synapomorphies, there is significant evidence to suggest that Nautilus pompilius exhibits phenotypic plasticity. Namely, Nautilus subspecies identification through taxonomic features is difficult between populations as many features that were thought to be unique may overlap across different Nautilus populations. Other subspecies such as N. belauensis, N. macromphalus, and N. scrobiculatus are regionally bound and known to inhabit areas around Palau, New Caledonia, and Papua-New Guinea respectively. N. pompilius represents the type species as it is the most common and widely distributed member of the Nautilus family, and is used as a point of comparison to other Nautilus members. Phylogenetic analysis conducted utilizing DNA and morphological data between members suggests that N. pompilius represents a paraphyletic group of Nautilus members, though not including N. scrobiculatus.

Causes This condition is often associated with diabetes in advanced proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Other conditions causing rubeosis iridis include central retinal vein occlusion,Laatikainen L, Blach RK. \\"Behaviour of the iris vasculature in central retinal vein occlusion: a fluorescein angiographic study of the vascular response of the retina and the iris.\\" Br J Ophthalmol. 1977 Apr;61(4):272-7. . ocular ischemic syndrome,Dhooge M, de Laey JJ. \\"The ocular ischemic syndrome.\\" Bull Soc Belge Ophtalmol. 1989;231:1-13. . and chronic retinal detachment. Pathophysiology It is usually associated with disease processes in the retina, which involve the retina becoming starved of oxygen (ischaemic). The ischemic retina releases a variety of factors, the most important of which is VEGF. These factors stimulate the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis). Unfortunately, these new vessels do not have the same characteristics as the blood vessels originally formed in the eye. In addition, new blood vessels can form in areas that do not have them. Specifically, new blood vessels can be observed on the iris. In addition to the blood vessels in the iris, they can grow into the angle of the eye. These blood vessels eventually go through a process called fibrosis which closes the normal physiologic anatomy of the angle. The closing of the angle prevents fluid from leaving the eye resulting in an increase in intraocular pressure. This is called neovascular glaucoma. Treatment If caught early, the neovascularization can be reversed with prompt pan retinal photocoagulation (PRP), or injection of anti-VEGF medications with subsequent PRP. The injection blocks the direct effect of VEGF and acts more quickly but will wear off in about 6 weeks.Davidorf FH, Mouser JG, Derick RJ. \\"Rapid improvement of rubeosis iridis from a single bevacizumab (Avastin) injection.\\" Retina. 2006 Mar;26(3):354-6. . PRP has a slower onset of action but can last permanently. Once the neovascularization has been longstanding, the new vessels recruit fibrous tissue, and as this forms and contracts, the angle can be permanently damaged, and will not respond to treatment. If this occurs, then surgical intervention is required to reduce the pressure (such as a glaucoma drainage implant) See also *CNV (choroidal neovascularization) *CNV (corneal neovascularization) *NVD (neovascularization of the disc) References  External links  Disorders of iris and ciliary body ","title":"Rubeosis iridis"},{"id":"5728246","text":"Eubule Thelwall (1562‚Äì1630) Jesus College Chapel, Oxford.

He was principal of Jesus College, Oxford from 1621 to 1630. Life Thelwall was the fifth son of John Wynne Thelwall. He was educated at Westminster School and was a scholar at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he received his BA in 1577. Thelwall matriculated at the University of Oxford on 14 July 1579, and was awarded his MA on 13 June 1580. He was Chief Master of the Alienation office from 1579 to 1599 and was called to the bar in 1599. On 8 March 1605, he was appointed steward and recorder of Ruthin for life. He built the house of Plas Coch and on 28 December 1607 he received a joint grant of the office of Prothonotary and Clerk of the Crown in Anglesey, Carnarvonshire, and Merionethshire for life, in reversion after the death of Richard Fowler.

In 1624, he was elected Member of Parliament for Denbighshire. He was treasurer of Gray's Inn in 1625. In 1626 he was elected MP for Denbighshire again. He was re-elected MP for Denbighshire in 1628 and sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. Thelwall died on 8 October 1630, aged 68 and was buried in Jesus College Chapel where a monument was erected to his memory by his brother Sir Bevis Thelwall (Page of the King's Bedchamber and Clerk of the Great Wardrobe). Another brother Simon was also MP for Denbighshire. Thelwall never married, and left his estate (Plas Coch in the parish of Llanychan, Denbighshire) to his nephew John.

The area is rural and close to the sea. Historically it is known as a grain-producing area. It holds New Zealand's largest feedlot, where Wakanui Beef is produced through intensive farming. History The European history of the area started with runs 139, 140, and 150 being taken up in 1854 and 1855. Wakanui is located between Ashburton and the sea, and east of the Ashburton River / Hakatere. An early owner (probably not the initial owners) was the Kermode and Moore partnership, with George Henry Moore as manager. When Kermode and Moore sold their holdings, the land was subdivided (this process finished by 1877) and more people moved into the area. Around that time, an extensive irrigation system was implemented, which was extended across all of Ashburton County, and that opened the dry but fertile land for wheat growing. Some of irrigation races were built throughout the county. An electoral redistribution was carried out just prior to the and the electorate was formed (by splitting off areas from the and electorates). The Wakanui electorate was in existence for two electoral cycles and was dis- established in 1887. In 1879, a large flour mill was erected in Wakanui. The five-storey building was a landmark for the rural location. In 1906, the mill building was hauled over to Ashburton. It was deemed advisable that none of the machinery be removed and in all the building weighed an estimated . The building survived the relocation without damage. Wakanui School Wakanui School opened in 1876 with an initial roll of 35 pupils. In the early decades, the roll peaked in 1890 but at the fiftieth jubilee, the roll was back where it started as more schools had opened throughout the county. A full primary school (i.e. serving years 1 to 8), the roll was 122 in July 2019. Wakanui Beef ANZCO Foods feedlot in WakanuiThese days, the name Wakanui is known best for New Zealand's largest feedlot. Owned by ANZCO Foods, beef is produced here; the meat is sold under the brand name Wakanui Beef. The feedlot is consented for 19,000 cattle and it held 14,000 in 2018. While the feedlot has been in operation since 1991, it only became widely known when animal rights group SAFE published drone footage of it in 2018 and called for feedlots to be banned. Damien O'Connor, as Minister of Agriculture, weighed in on the debate in support of the feedlot. He called it \\"innovative\\" and said it was, in general, \\"very well managed\\"; he added, \\"the image of pastoral farming is the one New Zealand promotes and it is the mainstay of our industry\\".

A. scrobiculatus is instantly recognizable by the large open umbilicus, which is around 20% of the shell diameter at its widest point. This species, along with the closely related A. perforatus, were originally placed in the genus Nautilus, but have recently been given their own genus on account of significant morphological differences.Ward, P.D. & W.B. Saunders 1997. Allonautilus: a new genus of living nautiloid cephalopod and its bearing on phylogeny of the Nautilida. Journal of Paleontology 71(6): 1054‚Äì1064. The most obvious are features of the shell, including crease and an encrusting layer (periostracum) that covers most of the shell. Gills and reproductive structures also differ significantly from members of the genus Nautilus. The shell is usually up to around 18 cm in diameter, although the largest specimen ever recorded measured 21.5 cm. The species was thought to have gone extinct after 1986, but was rediscovered in July 2015. According to The Telegraph, \\"the allonautilus scrobiculatus has inhabited the earth for 500 million years and has only been seen twice, until now\\". Taxonomy The genus Allonautilus, which contains a mere 2 species, is a sister genus of the Nautilus which contains 11 species, 5 of which are widely accepted as being distinct. The Allonautilus is very understudied and not much is known about it. However, the more commonly known sister genus, the Nautilus, has been known to natural historians since the renaissance. Nautiluses show very little speciation within the genus and are a distant cousin to the squid and octopus. Description A. scrobiculatus‚Äô close lineage with nautiluses is juxtaposed by their very distinct morphological features which differ greatly from that of the nautilus. A very distinct feature that one will immediately notice is the organism‚Äôs thick, hairy, slime-covered shell. A. scrobiculatus is covered with white, irregularly shaped, multipronged papillae which extend from the surface of its hood. The first illustration of the internal anatomy of Allonautilus scrobiculatus from a 1912 monograph by Arthur Willey. In addition, it possesses a scrobiculate shell shape, meaning the shells have numerous grooves made into them unlike the Allonautilus perforatus, the only other organism in its genus; other than this, these two organisms share a very similar shell shape and coloration. A. scrobiculatus‚Äô gills are similar in structure to those of the nautilus, however, differ in size proving smaller, with less folioles, in similarly sized nautilus specimens. =Periostracum= An unusual feature of Allonautilus scrobiculatus is its periostracum or \\"shell skin\\". The \\"shaggy\\" periostracumon is present on freshly caught samples, and is thickly interlayered, resembling slimy hair. Allonautilus scrobiculatus, or otherwise known as the crusty nautilus or fuzzy nautilus is a species of cephalopod. The species dates back roughly 500 million years and for decades, has impressed biologists and researchers with the species‚Äô evolutionary grit, surviving for several millions of years, unchanged. A. scrobiculatus is considered by many to be a ‚Äúliving fossil‚Äù, similar to coelacanths and horseshoe crabs. A. scrobiculatus‚Äô most recently sighting was in July 2015 by biologist Peter Ward of the University of Washington. Ward‚Äôs colleague, Bruce Saunders, a geologist from Bryn Mawr College was the one who had initially sighted the organism all the way back in 1984. Distribution and habitat A. scrobiculatus is primarily found in waters surrounding Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. It tends to live in a very narrow range at further depths (roughly 500‚Äì1,300 ft), eluding many researchers and scientists. This is a result of the species‚Äô intolerance to heat making it unable to live in too shallow of waters and the species‚Äô ‚Äúfail depth‚Äù, meaning it will die if venturing into too deep waters.

It was written by Jean-Marc Lofficier and illustrated by various artists for publishers Semic Comics and Image Comics in 2002 and 2003. Membership The team was composed of the following characters: * Futura, a mysterious woman from another dimension somehow related to Wampus * Homicron, a NASA physicist whose body is inhabited by the energies and memories of a powerful alien * Jaleb, the agent of a race of galactic telepaths * Jaydee (or Jayde in the French version), an alien shapeshifter killing machine and last of its kind * Starlock, the former servant of awesome cosmic entities, now a fugitive * Tanka, a former Tarzan- like jungle lord, empowered by men from the distant future to safeguard our segment of time. Story Homicron asks Starlock to assist the international security organization C.L.A.S.H. with the disposal of WMDs stored in a space station. Meanwhile, on Earth, Tanka enlists Futura's help and tries to rescue Jaleb from his comatose state. In orbit, the space station is taken over by the robotic army of the power-mad scientist Astaroth. Homicron, Starlock and Futura join the forces of C.L.A.S.H. to battle Astaroth. However, all is not what it seems, as a new villain is revealed, who was secretly pulling manipulating Astaroth all along: the deadly Tarantula, who uses a brainwashed Jaydee as her tool and plans to crash the station on Earth, virtually ending all life on the planet. Finally, the true mastermind behind the doomsday scheme is revealed: the arch-villain the Necromancer. From his base on the Moon, the dying Necromancer schemes to turn Earth into his funeral pyre. But his passing would not be complete without the humiliation of his arch-enemies, the super-group known as Hexagon. As the Strangers mount a last, desperate attempt on the Moonbase to stop the villain's suicidal plan, he turns Hexagon against them. The villain then takes refuge in his ultimate citadel: a station in orbit around the Sun, from which he plans to cause our star to go nova, using Starlock's precious starseed which he recovered on the Moon. The Strangers follow, and the final battle against the Necromancer begins. Tanka and Jaleb arrive in time to save the day. The ultimate chess player finally reveals himself: Duke Oxian, the mad neuroform from the far future, who, from the heart of the Sun itself, schemes to reshape the patterns of time. Only Homicron and Jaleb can safely go to challenge him in the heart of the Sun. Two subsequent episodes dealt with the origins of Futura and Starlock. Bibliography =Le Dossier Homicron= * 1.

A Queensland State of Origin representative half back, he played his club football in the National Rugby League (NRL) for the Brisbane Broncos (with whom he won the 2006 NRL Premiership) and Parramatta Eels, as well as in the Super League for the Catalans Dragons. Early life Born 24 January 1980 in Nambour, Queensland, McGuire was playing junior league for Caloundra Sharks & Kawana Dolphins. He then attended Caloundra State High QSSRL in 1997 when he was selected for the Australian Schoolboys rugby league team. Professional career =Parramatta Eels= McGuire made his NRL debut in round 22 of the 1998 season for the Parramatta Eels against Penrith at Penrith Park. The following week, he played in the club's 50-4 victory over Western Suburbs at Parramatta Stadium. =Brisbane Broncos= The next season, he returned to Queensland to play for the Brisbane Broncos. At Brisbane, he was a utility player, normally used in games from the bench. In the 2002 NRL season, he played in Brisbane's preliminary final defeat against eventual premiers the Sydney Roosters. McGuire subsequently played in the club's 2004 and 2005 finals campaigns. McGuire played from the interchange bench in the 2006 NRL Grand Final victory over Melbourne at Telstra Stadium. =Queensland= He was selected for the Queensland Maroons in the 2005 State of Origin series playing off the bench for games 1 and 2.

McGuire played 21 games in 2011 for Parramatta as the club narrowly avoided the wooden spoon. A pectoral muscle injury during the 2012 NRL season put the remainder of McGuire's playing career in doubt. McGuire returned for Parramatta in their final game of the season which came against St. George Illawarra in round 26 at ANZ Stadium. The match was the final game for retiring Parramatta legends Nathan Hindmarsh and Luke Burt. Parramatta would go on to lose the match 29-8 and the club finished last for the first time since 1972. The game was subsequently McGuire's last in the top grade.

Playing career Helenius was selected 15th overall in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft by the Tampa Bay Lightning, partly on the strength of his silver-medal-winning performance for the Finnish national men's hockey team in the 2006 under-18 World Junior Championships. He played for Ilves during the 2006‚Äì07 season but due to a shoulder injury only played four games. The Seattle Thunderbirds selected Helenius with the 46th overall selection in the 2007 Canadian Hockey League Import Draft. Helenius joined the Thunderbirds roster at the start of the 2007‚Äì2008 season. In December 2007, Helenius was selected as goalie for the Finnish World Junior Team in the 2008 IIHF World Junior Championships. On October 17, 2008, Helenius was assigned to the Augusta Lynx of the ECHL. He played first NHL game on January 30, 2009 against the Philadelphia Flyers. In 2009, he went on to play for S√∂dert√§lje SK after playing just 10 game for the Norfolk Admirals. For the 2011‚Äì12 season he returned to Finland and signed with JYP Jyv√§skyl√§ of the SM-liiga, where he won the league championship and the Urpo Yl√∂nen trophy for best goaltender. After a great season in Finland, Steve Yzerman, General Manager of the Tampa Bay Lightning, expressed interest in bringing Helenius back to North America, as he was still a Lightning prospect. On June 13, 2012, Helenius signed a two-year contract with the Lightning. In the midst of the 2013‚Äì14 season, with Helenius unable to make an impact up the Lightning's depth chart, on February 22, 2014, he was placed on $125 unconditional waivers, which would bring his contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning to an mutual end. On April 14, 2014, Helenius agreed to a multi-year contract with Finnish club Jokerit of the KHL.

Green and furthered researched with Marian Petre. The dimensions can be used to evaluate the usability of an existing information artifact, or as heuristics to guide the design of a new one, and are useful in Human-Computer Interaction design.A. F. Blackwell, C. Britton, A. Cox, T. R. G. Green, C. Gurr, G. Kadoda, M. S. Kutar, M. Loomes, C. L. Nehaniv, M. Petre, C. Roast, C. Roe, A. Wong, R. M. Young, \\"Cognitive Dimensions of Notations: Design Tools for Cognitive Technology\\", Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 2117, 325-341, 2001. doi: 10.1007/3-540-44617-6_31 Cognitive dimensions are designed to provide a lightweight approach to analyse the quality of a design, rather than an in- depth, detailed description. They provide a common vocabulary for discussing many factors in notation, UI or programming language design. Also, cognitive dimensions help in exploring the space of possible designs through design maneuvers, changes intended to improve the design along one dimension. List of the cognitive dimensions Thomas Green originally defined 14 cognitive dimensions: ; Abstraction gradient : What are the minimum and maximum levels of abstraction exposed by the notation? Can details be encapsulated? ; Closeness of mapping : How closely does the notation correspond to the problem world? ; Consistency : After part of the notation has been learned, how much of the rest can be successfully guessed? ; Diffuseness / terseness : How many symbols or how much space does the notation require to produce a certain result or express a meaning? ; Error-proneness : To what extent does the notation influence the likelihood of the user making a mistake? ; Hard mental operations : How much hard mental processing lies at the notational level, rather than at the semantic level? Are there places where the user needs to resort to fingers or penciled annotation to keep track of what's happening? ; Hidden dependencies : Are dependencies between entities in the notation visible or hidden? Is every dependency indicated in both directions? Does a change in one area of the notation lead to unexpected consequences? ; Juxtaposability : Can different parts of the notation be compared side by side at the same time? ; Premature commitment : Are there strong constraints on the order in which the user must complete the tasks to use the system? :Are there decisions that must be made before all the necessary information is available? Can those decisions be reversed or corrected later? ; Progressive evaluation : How easy is it to evaluate and obtain feedback on an incomplete solution? ; Role-expressiveness : How obvious is the role of each component of the notation in the solution as a whole? ; Secondary notation and escape from formalism : Can the notation carry extra information by means not related to syntax, such as layout, color, or other cues? ; Viscosity : Are there any inherent barriers to change in the notation? How much effort is required to make a change to a program expressed in the notation? : This dimension can be further classified into the following types: :* 'Knock-on viscosity' : a change in the code violates internal constraints in the program, whose resolution may violate further internal constraints. :* 'Repetition viscosity' : a single action within the user‚Äôs conceptual model requires many, repetitive device actions. :* 'Scope viscosity' : a change in the size of the input data set requires changes to the program structure itself. ; Visibility : How readily can required parts of the notation be identified, accessed and made visible? =Other dimensions= In addition to the above, new dimensions are sometimes proposed in the HCI research field, with different levels of adoption and refinement. Such candidate dimensions include creative ambiguity (does the notation encourage interpreting several meanings of the same element?), indexing (are there elements to guide finding a specific part?), synopsis (\\"Gestalt view\\" of the whole annotated structure) or unevenness (some creation paths are easier than others, which bias the expressed ideas in a developed artifact).  User activities  The authors identify four main user activities with interactive artifacts: incrementation [creation], transcription, modification and exploratory design. Each activity is best served by a different trade-off in the usability on each dimension. For example, a high viscosity (resistance to change) is harmful for modification and exploration activities, but less severe for the one-off tasks performed in transcription and incrementation.  Design maneuvers  A design maneuver is a change made by the designer in the notation design, to alter its position within a particular dimension. Dimensions are created to be pairwise independent, so that the design can be altered in one dimension while keeping a second one constant. But this usually results in a trade-off between dimensions. A modification increasing the usability of the notation in one dimension (while keeping a second one constant) will typically reduce its usability in a third dimension. This reflects an assumption in the framework that there is no perfect interface and that trade-offs are a fundamental part of usability design. An example of a design maneuver is reducing the viscosity of a notation by adding abstraction mechanisms. This can be done by incorporating style sheets, an abstraction that represent the common styling attributes of items in a document, to a notation where each item in a document has defined its own individual style. After this design maneuver is made, an editor that changes the style sheet will modify all items at once, eliminating the repetition viscosity present in the need to change the style of each individual item.

Examples of secondary notation include the syntax highlighting of computer source code, sizes and color codes for easy recognition of consumer symbols such as bank notes or coins, or the regular typographic conventions often found in technical books to highlight sections with the same type of content. Secondary notation provides redundant (more than necessary) information; if the visual cues are the only way that some information is provided, such as in traffic lights, or a chart's key, it is not secondary. Secondary notation is often not a part of the formal notation itself. Rather, it is a method of organizing the formal notation to allow it to be more easily understood. Thus, secondary notation does not change the actual meaning of the formal notation, rather it allows for the meaning to be readily understood. In text such as programming languages, this can be done using cues such as indentation and coloring. In formal graphical notations, this can be done through the use of symmetry or proximity to indicate relatedness. In different contexts Secondary notation annotates formal notation in a number of contexts which can be broken down to two main domains: text and graphics. =Textual context= There are a number of common instances of secondary notation that are seen in text. Secondary notation is common in typography and in code editors appearing as boldness, italics, and spacing/indentation. Textual secondary notation in computer source code Secondary notation in the form of coloring and indentation is commonly implemented in integrated development environments to make source code more readable and make the formal notation more understandable. The following C source code does not use secondary notation to ease the interpretation of the formal notation: \` int main(){while(true){printf(\\"I'm stuck in an infinite loop!\\");}} \` The following is the same code, but with indentation and syntax highlighting. As a result, the formal notation of C is easier to read: int main() { while (true) { printf(\\"I'm stuck in an infinite loop!\\"); } } Textual secondary notation in typography A number of examples of secondary notation that commonly appear in English writing include * Boldness which is used to put emphasis on a certain area of text. * Italics which is another method of applying emphasis on a certain area of text. * The following example effectively uses indentation to separate items on a shopping list that must be bought at different stores. Indented items all must be bought at the store within which the items are nested. 1\\\\. Allison's Frozen Foods  Frozen Tuna  Chicken patties  Fish sticks  2lb of hamburgers 2\\\\.

This is a poorly drawn model of the steps a user would take to place an order for some products on a website. A graphical representation that has been well studied and can be heavily impacted by secondary notation is a flowchart and especially drakon-charts. Research has shown that there are a number of layout factors unincorporated into the formal notation that impact a flowchart's ease of understanding: # Minimize arc crossings: the number of times lines cross should be kept to a minimum to ease traceability. In drakon-charts all the arc (line) crossings are forbidden. # Minimize line bends: additional bends add to the visual complexity of the model. In drakon-charts all the line bends are minimized. # Leverage symmetry: position elements symmetrically when possible # Align labels horizontally: textual labels are easier to read when aligned horizontally # Use of locality: group related items together to be easily recognizable The examples on the right show how these techniques can drastically affect the ease of understanding when looking at a process model. The model depicts a simplified process for ordering products from a website. Both diagrams contain exactly the same blocks with the same interconnections. However, the one that uses better secondary notation can be readily understood whereas the other model requires careful analysis to understand its contents.  Misuse  While inadequate use of secondary notation can significantly increase the amount of effort necessary to understand a model, misuse of secondary notation can also be a detriment. Use of symmetry can make a graphic more visually appealing, but can also convey misconceptions if used incorrectly. For instance, placing unrelated items close together may cause a reader to perceive them as being related. Additionally, arbitrary use of coloring may distract a reader as they wonder about the meanings of the various colors. Experts vs. novices The ability of individuals to understand and use secondary notation has been shown to vary based on experience within the relevant field. Experts in a field are generally more able to utilize the clues provided by secondary notation. Specifically, while reading diagrams, experts have been shown to have more skill at reading the larger structure of the diagram and using it to guide their examination of the details provided by the formal notation. This compares to novices who often focus on the details of the formal notation, ignoring the hints provided by the secondary notation. There are also differences based on level of experience/expertise when creating documents that utilize secondary notation. Experts tend to be more consistent in their use of conventions while novices tend to vary between conventions, sometimes adhering on a surface level, but failing to convey the desired information. In the case of circuit diagrams, this is illustrated by common novice mistakes such as creating visual symmetry where there is no logical symmetry and frequent transitions between differing secondary notation conventions.  As part of formal notation  In some cases, secondary notation is part of the formal notation. Such formal notations attempt to improve readability by enforcing the presence of visual cues. The trade-off is that, what in many other cases is only secondary notation (like, for example, indentation in free-form languages), is now part of the formal notation, and thus is not optional. For example, the Python programming language requires source code to follow strict indentation rules. This is intended to improve readability of the code, by ensuring that statements that are at the same level of nesting within a block are aligned to the same column. Other types of secondary notation, however, are not part of the formal notation. For example, when wrapping long lines, every line that is a continuation of a previous line can be indented arbitrarily. if x  1: print(\\"x is 1\\") print(\\"x is odd\\") print(\\"This is always printed\\") # this is illegal print(\\"Hello world\\") str = \\" \\".join( \\"these words are indented\\", \\"for better readability\\") Markdown also uses indentation as part of the formal syntax of the language. Indentation is required in Markdown when creating certain source code representations of block quotations as well as when creating sections of source code to be rendered as the code itself. #Heading 1# #Indented Markdown source code that will be rendered as source code# See also * Cognitive dimensions * Syntax highlighting * Syntactic sugar Notes References * . * Marian Petre, Why looking isn't always seeing: readership skills and graphical programming.

David Roberts (1859, Chester ‚Äì 22 April 1928, Grantham) was the Chief Engineer and managing director of Richard Hornsby & Sons in the early 1900s. His invention, the caterpillar track, was demonstrated to the army in 1907. Chester He grew up in Great Boughton in the east of Chester, the son of David Roberts and his wife Anne, being trained as a hydraulic engineer, starting work for Hydraulic Engineering Company Ltd in 1873, staying with them for fifteen years, living in England and overseas. He worked for Sir WG Armstrong Mitchell & Company Ltd in Elswick, Newcastle upon Tyne from 1888, staying for eight years. For two and a half years he was manager of their Italian works at Pozzuoli, in the Province of Naples. Grantham He joined Hornsbys in 1895 as Chief Engineer, and Works Manager, having been knowledgeable of Hornsbys development of the compression-ignition heavy oil engine and the worldwide engineering potential of it. He became general manager, then managing director in 1904 (until 1918). Whilst at Hornsbys, their manufacturing area grew from to . From 1918‚Äì20, he was Joint managing director of Ruston & Hornsby Ltd, retiring in 1920. He was Vice- President of Grantham Liberal Club on London Road. At Hornsbys, his inventions included improvements to the Water-tube boiler. =The Caterpillar Tractor= In 1903, the War Office offered a prize of ¬£1000 to produce a tractor that could haul a load of 25 tons for without stopping for fuel or water. Hornsbys entered an 12-ton tractor, which was the only entrant to complete the , subsequently running on to before running out of fuel. Roberts, from this experience of the War Office competition, had the vision to design a vehicle for the British Army which would be able to traverse unstable ground. Vehicles such as Hornsby's 12-ton tractor would quickly be hindered by waterlogged surfaces with wheels sinking in mud. On 23 July 1904, his patent (No. 16,345) obviated this problem, with a vehicle where He submitted four other patents in later years, including No. 16,436 on 14 July 1909, which involved \\"Improvements in and connected with the Driving Axles of Chain Track Tractors and Locomotives\\". In 1905, a Hornsby 20-hp 17-ton tractor was fitted with a chain track. In July 1905 and February 1906, it was demonstrated at Grantham to representatives from the War Office. In August 1906, the 1903 competition- winning tractor was fitted with chain tracks. On testing this vehicle in July 1907, the word caterpillar was first used to describe the machine (by British soldiers). In May 1908, this vehicle was demonstrated to King Edward VII and the Prince of Wales at Aldershot, who were introduced to David Roberts. Hornsbys bought a Rochet-Schneider car, powered by a petrol engine in 1906. It was fitted with a chain track and was trialled by the Army in November 1907 in Aldershot. The 4-ton vehicle achieved speeds of over difficult terrain. Hornsbys, in a rare moment of marketing savoir-faire, commissioned a film of this vehicle to promote the virtues of the caterpillar track, which was to be shown at provincial and London cinemas in the summer of 1908. The film was first shown at the Empire Theatre of Varieties in Leicester Square on 27 April 1908, on a device then known as a bioscope. It was often of more interest than the actual film being shown, and is apparently the first film made for commercial purposes. Roberts was looking at increasing the speed of tracked vehicles. Hornsbys bought a Mercedes car and fitted it with chained tracks with wooden wheels to test a desert environment. Tests with this vehicle on Skegness beach in 1908‚Äì09 achieved speeds of ; such speeds with a caterpillar- tracked vehicle would not be surpassed until World War II. In 1910, Hornsbys sold four caterpillar tractors to the War Office‚Äîdriving the first from Grantham to Aldershot. The tractors were used for towing artillery. Unfortunately, the officers in the Royal Artillery were not enamoured with the vehicle, finding it noisy and slow. One officer wrote, \\"The team of eight horses in my opinion is far superior under every condition.\\" Hornsbys thought civilian applications of the caterpillar track would be popular, but they only ended up selling one vehicle. Holt Manufacturing and C.L. Best Tractor Co. (the originator was Daniel Best) of the USA recognised its potential and sold many tracked vehicles; their vehicles were steered by a front wheel, unlike modern tanks. Hornsbys, with no incentives from military orders, did not see the same glowing future for the type of vehicle. They sold the patent to Holt, and only a year later, the British Army ordered 442 of Holt's caterpillar tracked vehicles made under licence by Ruston in Lincoln. Family He married Elizabeth Gertrude Anderson (born 1860 in Kingston upon Hull) in 1885, daughter of banker in Hull. They had four sons and a daughter: David (born c. 1887), William (born c. 1888, known as Willie) (both born in Chester), Marion (born c. 1890 in Pozzuoli, Italy), Kenneth (born 1891 in Gosforth, became managing director of the James Coultas agricultural engineering company in Grantham) and Cyril (born c. 1893 in Newcastle). In Newcastle, they lived at Elswick. In Grantham, they lived at 64 London Road. He died on 22 April 1928, aged 69, at his home \\"Beaconfield\\" on Beacon Lane in Grantham (the house is now the NHS Beaconfield Psychiatric Clinic). He was made a Freeman of the City of Chester. He was buried in Grantham Cemetery on 25 April 1928.

The faculty consists of four departments with activities in the fields of public administration and policymaking, business administration, financial management, and industrial management. Over the years, the faculty has sought to create suitable ground for the growth of interdisciplinary studies in Islamic management through the gathering of specialist professors in Islamic knowledge and management from across the country. The students simultaneously study the fields of Islamic knowledge and management. By integrating these two fields innovatively, the background for exploiting religious principles in management is provided. Consequently, several groups of students who have graduated from this college are now active in theorizing on Islamic management, and in providing training in and implementing Islamic management patterns. So far, 700 students have graduated from this department and are providing services in important executive and academic jobs. The Faculty of Islamic Knowledge and Management of Imam Sadiq University is a suitable center for the development of Islamic management studies.

It partnered with the Steel Workers Organizing Committee and CIO, in November 1935. Both organizations disbanded May 22, 1942, to form a new organization, the United Steelworkers. The Homestead strike The Bost Building in Homestead, Pennsylvania, was used as the headquarters of the association during the Homestead Strike. It is now a National Historic Landmark for its association with the strike. The Homestead strike was a major turning point for the union. Carnegie placed strong anti-unionist Henry Clay Frick in charge of his company's operations in 1881.Frick had ruthlessly broken unions in the coke-producing regions of Pennsylvania and Ohio, and crushed the seamen's unions on the Great Lakes. Foner, p. 207. With the union's contract due to expire on June 30, 1892, Frick demanded a 22 percent wage decrease, then unilaterally announced that if an agreement was not reached he would no longer recognize the union.Foner, p. 206-207; Rayback, p. 195-96; Brody, 1969, p. 53; Krause, p. 302-03. Frick locked the workers out on June 29.Foner, footnote p. 207; Foner, p. 208; Krause, p. 302, 310. Krause, p. 284-310, contains the best discussion of the bargaining timeline and exchange of proposals. The striking workers ringed the plant and patrolled the Monongahela River (which ran alongside the mill) to prevent anyone from entering.Foner, p. 208-09; Krause, p. 311; Brody, 1969, p. 59; Dubofsky and Dulles, p. 154. Local sheriff's deputies failed to retake the plant on July 5.Krause, p. 26. Frick then sent 300 Pinkerton National Detective Agency guards to seize the plant and re-open it on the night of July 5. The Pinkerton men were ordered to approach the plant from the river.Foner, p. 209; Krause, p. 15, 271. But the strikers learned of the Pinkertons' arrival.Foner, p. 209; Krause, p. 16. Krause indicates that at least a thousand people watched the Pinkertons attempt to land. The Pinkertons attempted to land about 4 a.m., and the crowd surged onto the Homestead plant grounds.Krause, p. 16-18. Brody cites Andrew Carnegie, who claimed that Frick had not extended the barbed-wire fence to the riverbank, allowing the strikers access to the plant grounds. Brody, 1969, p. 59. But Foner says that the strikers tore down the fence near the water's edge. Foner, p. 209. Supporting Foner, see Krause, p. 17. A shot was fired, then both sides opened fire. Two workers and two Pinkertons died and dozens were wounded.Krause is the most accurate source on the number of dead, including the names of the killed and wounded. Krause, p. 19-20. The Pinkerton tug departed with the wounded agents, leaving the remaining agents stranded.Krause, p. 20-21. The strikers continued to sporadically fire on the stranded barges, and an attempt was made to sink the barges with a cannon.Krause, p. 21-22; Brody, 1969, p. 59. When the Pinkertons tried to disembark again at 8:00 a.m., a firefight broke out and four more strikers were killed.Krause, p. 22-25, 30; Brody, 1969, p. 59. The strikers attempted to burn the barges several times during the day, but failed.Krause, p. 24; Foner, p. 210. At 5:00 p.m., the Pinkertons surrendered and were handed over to the sheriff.Krause, p. 38-39. On July 9, despite union claims that law and order had been restored, Governor Robert E. Pattison ordered the state militia to seize the town.Krause, p. 32, 333-34; Foner, p. 212; Dubofsky and Dulles, p. 154-55. More than 8,000 militia arrived on July 12, and within 90 minutes company officials were back in their offices.Krause, p. 337-38. Strike leaders were charged with conspiracy, riot, murder and treason.Foner, p. 213-15; Krause, p. 345, 348-49. The strike collapsed after an anarchist gained entrance to Frick's office and shot and stabbed him (although not mortally).Dubofsky and Dulles, p. 155; Krause, p. 354-55; Rayback, p. 196. Public support for the strike evaporated, and large numbers of strikers began crossing the picket line.Krause, p. 355-57. The AA was nearly bankrupted by the job action, and voted to return to work on November 20, 1892.Krause, p. 356-57; Foner, p. 215-17. In February 1893, the company and the union agreed to drop the charges filed against one another.Krause, p. 348. 1901 organizing drive at U.S. Steel The Homestead strike affected the AA nationwide. The Joliet Iron and Steel Company, the Jones and Laughlin Steel Company, the St. Louis Wire Mill Company, the Edgar Thomson Steel Works and the Duquesne works all refused to sign contracts with the AA while the Homestead labor action lingered. A deepening in 1889 of the Long Depression led most steel companies to seek wage decreases similar to those imposed at Homestead.Brody, 1969, p. 57. In 1893, Carnegie defeated an AA union drive at the Duquesne steelworks. In 1885, Carnegie ousted the AA at the Edgar Thomson works.Brody, 1969, p. 58-59. An organizing drive at the Homestead plant in 1896 was crushed by Frick. In May 1899, 300 Homestead workers actually formed a lodge, but Frick ordered the Homestead works shut down and the unionization effort collapsed. Carnegie Steel remained nonunion.Brody, 1969, p. 56-57. De- unionization efforts throughout the Midwest began in 1897 when Jones and Laughlin Steel refused to sign a contract. By 1900, not a single steel plant in Pennsylvania remained union. The AA presence in Ohio and Illinois continued for a few more years, but the union continued to collapse. Many lodges disbanded, their members disillusioned. Others were easily broken in short, desultory battles. Carnegie Steel's Mingo Junction, Ohio, plant was the last major unionized steel mill, in the north and east, but it, too, broke the AA and withdrew recognition in 1903.Brody, 1969, p. 57-58. There was however a medium-sized mill in Granite City, IL (Granite City Steel) that continued to have active AA lodges from the late 1890s until SWOC was founded. This plant became part of National Steel Corp. until its assets were sold to US Steel in bankruptcy. The Granite City plant remains the oldest operating integrated mill in North America (and probably in the Western Hemisphere). This sign was at the ground floor entrance to the Labor Temple in Granite City, IL. Note the AAIST Lodge Numbers at the top. These were all located at Granite City Steel. Electrical Workers 68 was also at that plant. In 1936 all those units joined SWOC and subsequently in 1942 they became part of the Steelworkers.Lodges 16, 30 and 67 existed until 2003 when they were part of a merger that included the O&T; local 9325 and the Security local 4063 to create a new local 1899 (because evidence existed of a union since at least that year.) They are arguably the oldest continuously existing steel local unions in the USA. =Search for growth= AA membership sagged to 10,000 in 1894 from its high of over 24,000 in 1891. A year later, it was down to 8,000. By 1909, it had sunk to 6,300.Foner, p. 218 The collapse of the AA in the steel industry was due not only to the shock of the loss at Homestead, but by changing conditions in the steel industry. So long as steel, like iron smelting, remained a craft- like endeavor, the AA‚Äîwith the allegiance of each plant's skilled workers‚Äîcould control the industry. But as the steel industry mechanized, the skills needed to manufacture steel shrank. Inexperienced workers could learn the unskilled work quickly. Steel manufacturers also realized that having multi-plant operations meant that production could continue if the union struck a particular facility. Although the AA lost nearly all its members in the steel industry, the union continued to maintain its presence in the iron industry. The AA looked for growth, however, in the tin industry, which still required skilled workers. By 1900, the union had organized 75 percent of the sheet metal mills and all but one of the tin mills in the country. That year, the union changed its name to the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel and Tin Workers.Brody, 1969, p. 60. =Crisis of the trusts= But the AA seriously misjudged the economics of the tin industry. A sheet metal trust formed in 1900 which brought nonunion plants into competition with the AA's unionized facilities at the American Sheet Steel Company. The company refused to recognize the AA and idled union plants while keeping nonunion works running at full speed.Brody, 1969, p. 60-61. The formation of the U.S. Steel trust in 1901 threatened the AA with ruin. The trust incorporated plants of the American Tin Plate Co. into U.S Steel. If the AA was to save its existing locals at American Tin Plate and American Sheet Steel, it had to organize all the plants of U.S. Steel. But before an organizing drive could get under way, U.S. Steel's tin plate subsidiary withdrew recognition from the AA and refused to bargain at unionized plants. The independent American Sheet Steel did the same.Brody, 1969, p. 62-63; Dubofsky and Dulles, p. 174. =Recognition strike at U.S. Steel= The AA tried to organize U.S. Steel by staging a recognition strike. U.S. Steel executives pressured American Sheet Steel executives into recognizing the AA at most Sheet Steel plants on July 13, 1901. But AA president T.J. Shaffer rejected the deal because it did not cover all American Sheet Steel plants.Brody, 1969, p. 63-66; Rayback, p. 218. U.S. Steel president J.P. Morgan then backed out of the deal. The strike failed. U.S. Steel and American Sheet Steel workers refused to leave work, both companies hired thousands of strikebreakers, and the AFL refused to support the AA financially or organizationally.Dubofsky and Dulles, p. 174; Brody, 1969, p. 66. The strike against U.S. Steel ended on September 14.Foner, p. 374-75; Brody, 1969, p. 66-67. Aftermath of the U.S. Steel strike The AA never recovered from the U.S. Steel strike. It turned strongly conservative, hoping through submissiveness and cooperation to maintain its few remaining contracts. U.S. Steel slowly dismantled AA unions in its plants.Rayback, p. 218; Brody, 1969, p. 68-69. The puddlers in the union's ironworker locals attempted to secede in 1907. Angered at the union's decline and the way national leaders ignored their interests, the puddlers had retained membership throughout the battles with Carnegie and U.S. Steel. Adopting their old Sons of Vulcan name, about 1,250 of the AA's 2,250 puddlers left the union. But the secession did not last. The Sons of Vulcan won recognition from the Lockhart Iron and Steel Company of McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania. But when the new union demanded a massive wage hike in 1910, the union was forced to strike. After the successful strike, fights broke out between returning union members and strikebreakers who had stayed in the plant. The company slowly replaced all the strikers. Weakened, the Sons of Vulcan soon lost recognition at Youngstown Sheet and Tube, and at the A.M. Byers ironworks. The secessionists slowly drifted back into the AA.Brody, 1969, p. 69. On June 1, 1909, U.S. Steel finally withdrew recognition of the AA at the 12 remaining unionized mills. While the union's larger locals, such as those at Youngstown Sheet and Tube and the LaBelle Iron Works, disbanded without a fight, most of the union's smaller affiliates fought back. A strike was called. The AFL began a national campaign to publicize dangerous working conditions in the company's plants and the monopolistic nature of the trust. U.S. Steel aggressively countered, breaking up union meetings with hired thugs, driving organizers out of town, bringing in strikebreakers and shifting production to other plants. Although the AA flirted with bankruptcy, donations from other unions kept it afloat. The strike dragged on for 14 months, and was broken in December 1910.Brody, 1969, p. 71-73, 159; Rayback, p. 218-19. In 1911, the AA was unable to win wage increases among independent steel employers to match those unilaterally bestowed by U.S. Steel.Brody, 1969, p. 73. The depression of 1915 forced sizeable wage decreases on the union. The union, which had once organized nearly every tin and sheet metal plant in the country, now could count less than one-fifth under contract. Once the largest affiliate of the AFL, now the AA numbered a mere 6,500 members.Brody, 1969, p. 73, 75. Blacklisting of union members and supporters and the common use of yellow-dog contracts became widespread, hindering the union.Brody, 1969, p. 80-85. Post-war activism Faced with declining membership, the AA amended its constitution in 1910 and offered membership to all iron and steel workers. Few took the union up on its offer.Brody, 1969, p. 126-127. In 1909, AA president P.J. McArdle won approval for an AFL organizing drive at U.S. Steel, but the drive never got off the ground.Brody, 1969, p. 132-133. During World War I, the AA saw some limited growth. The AFL formed a National Committee for Organizing the Iron and Steel Workers to take advantage of worker restiveness. More than 15 AFL unions participated in the committee, while 24 claimed jurisdiction over portions of the steel industry. John Fitzpatrick and William Z. Foster of the Chicago Federation of Labor became the committee leaders. But the organizing drive was hampered by the refusal of many of the participating unions to provide resources and support, and by the committee's lack of a mechanism to enforce jurisdictional agreements and requisition funds.Brody, 1969, p. 199-225; Dubofsky and Dulles, p. 219-20. A shoving match between the AFL and the steel companies led to the next major push to organize the steel industry. =1919 steel strike= Shortly after Armistice Day, AFL organizers in and around Pittsburgh began to be harassed. The anti-union pressure quickly spread to the Midwest and West.Rayback, p. 285-286; Brody, 1969, p. 231-33. The AFL pushed back with a national strike. On April 1, 1919, miners in Pennsylvania struck to demand that local officials allow union meetings, and frightened town mayors soon issued meeting permits. The success of the miners' strike led the AA to hold a strike referendum in August in which 98 percent of its members favored a general steelworker strike to begin September 21.Dubofsky and Dulles, p. 220; Rayback, p. 286-87; Brody, 1969, p. 233-36. The September strike shut down half the steel industry.Brody, 1969, p. 233-44. But the owners quickly turned public opinion against the AFL. A Red Scare had swept the United States in the wake of the Russian revolution of October 1917. The steel companies took advantage of the change in the political climate, publishing articles exposing Foster's past as a Wobblie and syndicalist. The steel companies also played heavily on nativist hatreds and implied that immigrant steelworkers were communists. The use of state-sponsored violence against the union was widespread. President Woodrow Wilson's stroke, however, prevented federal officials from meeting steelmakers' demands to use federal troops to put down the strike. State and local authorities did intervene, and encouraged the use of widespread violence against the union. State militia violence was so bad that the U.S. Army was forced to occupy Gary, Indiana.Rayback, p. 287; Brody, 1969, p. 244-253; Dubofsky and Dulles, p. 220. Steel companies turned toward strikebreaking and rumor-mongering to break the strike. Tens of thousands of African American and Mexican workers were brought in as strikebreakers, and many racist white steelworkers returned to work to stop minorities from taking their jobs.Rayback, p. 287; Dubofsky and Dulles, p. 220-21; Brody, 1969, p. 254-55. The AFL refused to contribute funds or staff to support the strike. By November, most AA local affiliates had collapsed.Brody, 1969, p. 255-58. The Steel strike of 1919 collapsed on January 8, 1920. AA officials begged the National Committee to approve a unilateral return to work, but National Committee members voted to keep the strike going. The AA withdrew from the National Committee, and the organizing effort and strike ended.Brody, 1969, p. 258-62. New Deal organizing By mid-1933, the Great Depression and conservative leadership had left the AA with only 5,000 members and less than $30,000 in the bank. Union president Michael F. Tighe, 76, was referred to as 'Grandmother' due to his advanced age and timidity.Phelan, p. 100; Brody, \\"Origins...\\" 1987, p. 15-16; Schlesinger, p. 395; Marshall, 1936. Passage of the National Industrial Recovery Act on June 16, 1933, sparked widespread union organizing throughout the country. Even the AA attempted to organize workers. An organizing drive at Jones and Laughlin Steel saw more than 6,000 workers sign membership cards. A similar drive at the U.S. Steel works in nearby Duquesne in late 1933 enrolled one- quarter of the mill's unskilled workforce, mostly immigrants and blacks.See, generally, Pacchioli, 1999; Rose, 2001. The AA's membership rose to more than 150,000 by February 1934. Nearly one in two steelworkers had signed a union authorization card (although they had not become dues-paying members).Brody, \\"Origins...\\" 1987, p. 16. Although most historians claim AA membership was only 50,000 in February 1934, Brody points out that record-keeping in the AA headquarters had broken down due to lack of funds and that the 150,000 number is a better estimate. Strike activity, too, soared. Steel strikes affected the same proportion of the industry as strikes did strikes in the rubber and auto industries. The number of striking steel workers jumped from none in 1932 to 34,000 in 1933. Roughly 75 percent of the workers were fighting for recognition of their union.Brody, \\"Origins...\\" 1987, p. 15, 16. The Toledo Auto-Lite and Chevrolet strikes by auto workers and Akron Goodyear strike by the rubber workers have gained far more attention from historians than strikes in the steel industry, primarily because the Toledo and Akron strikes involved single employers and large numbers of workers rather than small units of workers affecting many employers. See Phelan, p. 86-95, and Zieger, p. 32-34. Tighe denounced the strikes and resented the way new members seized control of the lodges.Schlesinger, p. 395. =Rank and File Movement= In 1934, an opposition group known as the Rank and File Movement formed within the AA. A number of militant local affiliates had sprung up across the nation or had joined existing lodges in large enough numbers to elect their own, militant leaders. The locals coalesced into the Rank and File Movement and challenged the conservative leadership to act, demanding that the AA reorganize along industrial union lines. At the AA national convention in late April, the Rank and File Movement forced through a resolution which committed the international to a nationwide strike on June 16, 1934, if the major steel employers did not recognize the union in every plant.Brody, 'Origins...' 1987, p. 16; Phelan, p. 100; Rose, 2001; Staughton Lynd, 'The possibility of radicalism in the early 1930s: The case of steel,' Radical America 6 (Nov.‚ÄìDec. 1972), p. 36-35. Meanwhile, the federal regulatory scheme under which the AA had been organizing began to collapse. The National Labor Board (NLB), which attempted to enforce Section 7(a) of the NIRA, lacked the powers necessary to enforce the act, and employers had begun to ignore the Board and violate the law. Senator Robert F. Wagner, co-author of the NIRA, had begun to write new legislation in the fall of 1933 to more fully lay out the rights of workers in the U.S. and establish a new agency to enforce these rights. Wagner introduced his legislation on March 1, 1934.Morris, p. 40-46; Schlesinger, p. 150. Simultaneously, a fight was brewing between the United Auto Workers (UAW) and the auto industry. The UAW had organized nearly 50,000 auto workers in 1933, but the auto manufacturers had refused to recognize the union, established company unions and rejected the NLB's call for mediation. Roosevelt had personally intervened in the dispute. In an agreement applauded by the AFL, Roosevelt stripped the NLB of its jurisdiction over the auto industry and established a separate Automobile Labor Board.Morris, p. 38; Schlesinger, p. 394-95. The March 1934 auto industry agreement paved the way for new legislation which did away with the toothless NLB, but which only worsened the problems of the labor movement. With the steel strike deadline approaching, the steel industry was gearing up for war with the AA. But the Wagner bill, which might have averted a strike by establishing stronger protections for workers, had little chance of passing. Again Roosevelt intervened. He called a conference at the White House on June 12 at which AFL president William Green was one of the attendees. A compromise bill was hammered out which authorized the president to create one or more new labor boards to enforce Section 7(a) by conducting investigations, subpoenaing evidence and witnesses, holding elections and issuing enforcement orders.Morris, p. 47-48. At a special convention of the AA on June 13, Green convinced the AA to call the strike off. The Rank and File Movement's inadequate organization, the obstructionist policies of the Amalgamated's national leadership, strong opposition from the steel industry and the promise of enhanced governmental protection cut the legs out from the nascent organizing drive. Tighe exacted his revenge: Throughout the rest of the year, he suspended locals that called for aggressive action.Phelan, p. 100; Marshall, 1936; Rose, 2001. The Steel Labor Relations Board was created on June 28, 1934. =AFL attempts to organize= At its annual convention in San Francisco in October 1934, Green called for an organizing campaign in the steel industry.Zieger, 22-23; Phelan, p. 79-81. But no organizing drive in steel emerged. Only Green and two other AFL vice presidents supported the plan, the AFL executive council voted to initiate a joint organizing drive similar to the failed 1919 campaign.Phelan, p. 100-101. Green's sole supporters were John L. Lewis of the Mine Workers and David Dubinsky of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union. By early 1935, what little organizing the AA had exhibited in the steel industry melted away. When the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the NIRA on constitutional ground on May 27, 1935,The decision which struck down the NIRA was Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States 295 U.S. 495 (1935) the AFL's organizing drive collapsed.Brody, 'Origins...' 1987, p. 16; Zieger, p. 35. See also, generally, Pacchioli, 1999; and Rose, 2001. Merger with SWOC Other events swiftly overtook the AA. The National Labor Relations Act was signed into law by President Roosevelt on July 5, 1935. Committee for Industrial Organization (CIO) formed within the AFL on November 8, 1935.Zieger, p. 23-24. The CIO wanted to start a steel organizing campaign. But John L. Lewis and the CIO did not wish to leave the AFL, however, so the CIO resolved to work through the AA instead.Brody, \\"Origins...,\\" 1987, p. 20; Zieger, p. 29-33; Phelan, p. 129-142. The CIO attempted to push a steelworker industrial organizing plan for the AA through the January 1936 AFL executive council meeting, but the plan was rejected.Rayback, p. 350; Phelan, p. 135; Zieger, p. 35. The AFL instructed Green to come up with his own plan. Green's March 2, 1936, plan relied on a joint organizing committee and needed $750,000 in start-up costs alone. Only five of the AFL's 110 unions responded favorably, with a total contribution of $8,625 and five organizers. The CIO subverted the AA from within. John Brophy, the newly hired organizing director of the CIO, was able to infiltrate the AA convention and proposed that the delegates accept the CIO's offer. The delegates agreed to appoint a committee to study the proposal.Phelan, p. 135-136; See also, generally, Marshall, 1936. Tighe sent AA international secretary Louis Leonard to consult with Green, but Green could not match the CIO's offer. Lewis made it clear that the CIO would move ahead with an organizing drive in the steel industry with or without the AA.Phelan, p. 136. Confronted with a choice between irrelevance or collusion, AA officials accepted the CIO proposal, affiliated with the CIO on June 4, and agreed to make the AA an administrative unit of CIO's Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC). SWOC was formally announced in Pittsburgh on June 7, 1936.Phelan, p. 136; Brody, 'Origins...' 1987, p. 21. Green was outraged, the AFL suspended the 10 unions which belonged to the CIO in November 1936.Phelan, p. 136-142. Philip Murray was appointed director of SWOC, and ran the organization (and union) until his death in 1952.Zieger, p. 37. The AA under SWOC For the next six years, the AA remained inactive within SWOC. It issued charters and approved contracts for existing lodges, but let SWOC handle all matters regarding organizing and to negotiate contracts on behalf of new locals.Brody, 'Origins...' 1987, p. 26; Zieger, p. 36-37. The AA did participate in SWOC's \\"policy committee.\\" Half the members of the policy committee were drawn from CIO unions, half from SWOC staff. Four of the committee's eight members came from the Mine Workers, two from the AA, and one each from the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America and the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union. The committee met infrequently and at the pleasure of the director of SWOC, and served to rubber-stamp the director's actions. SWOC and the AA were disbanded at a convention held in Cleveland, Ohio, on May 22, 1942. A new organization, the United Steel Workers of America (USWA), was founded. Philip Murray was named president. David J. McDonald, Murray's long-time aide at SWOC, was appointed the first secretary-treasurer of the USWA.Dubofsky and Dulles, p. 283.

Upon receiving an ultimatum from the military demanding his resignation, Vargas went from his office into his bedroom and shot himself.

Army =Middle Ages= Moldavian troops in battle, as illustrated in Johannes de Thurocz (1488 edition); the Moldavian flag is displayed Under the reign of Stephen the Great, all farmers and villagers had to bear arms. Stephen justified this by saying that \\"every man has a duty to defend his fatherland\\"; according to Polish chronicler Jan D≈Çugosz, if someone was found without carrying a weapon, he was sentenced to death.The Annals of Jan D≈Çugosz, p. 566 Stephen reformed the army by promoting men from the landed free peasantry rƒÉze≈üi (i.e. something akin to freeholding yeomen) to infantry (voinici) and light cavalry (h√¢nsari) ‚Äî to make himself less dependent on the boyars ‚Äî and introduced his army to guns. In times of crises, The Small Host (Oastea MicƒÉ) ‚Äî which consisted of around 10,000 to 12,000 men ‚Äî stood ready to engage the enemy, while the Large Host (Oastea Mare) ‚Äî which could reach up to 40,000 ‚Äî had all the free peasantry older than 14, and strong enough to carry a sword or use the bow, recruited. This seldom happened, for such a lev√©e en masse was devastating for both economy and population growth. In the Battle of Vaslui, Stephen had to summon the Large Host and also recruited mercenary troops. Battle flag of Stephen the Great In the Middle Ages and early Renaissance, the Moldavians relied on light cavalry (cƒÉlƒÉra»ôi) which used hit-and-run tactics similar to those of the Tatars; this gave them great mobility and also flexibility, in case they found it more suitable to dismount their horses and fight in hand-to-hand combat, as it happened in 1422, when 400 horse archers were sent to aid Jagiellon Poland, Moldavia‚Äôs overlord against the Teutonic Knights. When making eye-contact with the enemy, the horse archers would withdraw to a nearby forest and camouflage themselves with leaves and branches; according to Jan D≈Çugosz, when the enemy entered the wood, they were \\"showered with arrows\\" and defeated.D≈Çugosz, p. 438 The heavy cavalry consisted of the nobility, namely, the boyars and their guards, the viteji (lit. \\"brave ones\\", small nobility) and the curteni ‚Äî the Court Cavalry (all nominally part of the Small Host). In times of war, boyars were compelled by the feudal system of allegiance to supply the prince with troops in accordance with the extent of their manorial domain. Other troops consisted of professional foot soldiers (lefegii) which fulfilled the heavy infantry role, and the plƒÉie≈üi, free peasants whose role was that of border guards: they guarded the mountain passes and were prepared to ambush the enemy and to fight delaying actions. In the absence of the prince, command was assigned to the Mare SpƒÉtar (Grand Sword-Bearer - a military office) or to the Mare Vornic (approx. Governor of the Country; a civilian office second only to the Voievod, which was filled by the prince himself). Supplying the troops was by tradition-later-made-into-law the duty of the inhabitants of those lands on which the soldiers were present at a given time. The Moldavians' (as well as Wallachians') favourite military doctrine in (defensive) wars was a scorched earth policy combined with harassment of the advancing enemy using hit-and-run tactics and disruption of communication and supply lines, followed by a large scale ambush: a weakened enemy would be lured in a place where it would find itself in a position hard or impossible to defend. A general attack would follow, often with devastating results. The shattered remains of what was once the enemy army would be pursued closely and harassed all the way to the border and sometimes beyond. A typical example of successful employments of this scenario is the Battle of Vaslui. =Decline and refounding= Towards the end of the 15th century, especially after the success of guns and cannons, mercenaries became a dominant force in the country‚Äôs military. With the economic demands created by the stagnation of the Ottoman Empire, the force diminished and included only mercenaries such as the seimeni. The 1829 Treaty of Adrianople allowed Moldavia to again maintain its own troops, no longer acting as an auxiliary under strict Ottoman supervision, and assigned red over blue pennants (see Flag and coat of arms of Moldavia). Their renewed existence under Mihail Sturdza was a major symbol and rally point for the nationalist cause, aiding in bringing about the 1848 Moldavian revolution. Fleet An early mention of a Moldavian naval fleet is found in connection with the rule of Aron Tiranul, who used it to help Wallachian ruler Michael the Brave establish his control over the Chilia branch of the Danube and Dobruja. The Treaty of Adrianople provided for a Moldavian self-defense naval force, to be composed of caicque vessels. Schooners armed with cannons were first built in the 1840s. Along with patrolling the Danube, these made their way on its tributaries, the Siret and the Prut River. References *Gheorghe I.

The clinic is situated in a semi-urban part of Kampala District, within a few miles of the centre of the capital and yet with housing that is unplanned, without plumbing for clean or waste water and with only partial connection to the electricity grid - let alone certainty of any constant utility supply. The philanthropic purpose of the clinic has, since 2000, allowed it to grow through actively creating Public Private Partnerships in health service delivery. As no profits are sought by the directors of the clinic, it can approach government and donors, as well as local NGOs, to bring necessary services to Makindye Division of Kampala. The Hope Clinic Lukuli continues to increase its linkages to the community level health providers and to be recognised by the city council and Ministry of Health as an important participant in health services provision. Having completed seven years since its foundation, and two years in the new premises, the clinic has a broad range of collaborations. The clinic has formed a number of public-private partnerships benefiting the 50,000 people living within of the clinic. Malaria treatment Since May 2007, Hope Clinic Lukuli has been able to access the NGO facility for malaria treatment drugs. The new Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT) drug available in Uganda under the facility is called Coartem. It is provided in four dosage packages and Hope Clinic Lukuli is able to receive it free of charge and provide it to the clients. This means that although the clients still pay half a US dollar for the medical examination and $1.50 for the laboratory testing, the potential cost of Coartem from a drug shop (US$10) can be avoided. Without this public-private cooperation, such free malaria treatment would only be available at government-staffed facilities. The nearest one to the clinic is 3‚Äì4 km away; yet 50,000 people live within only of the clinic. Malaria prevention In December 2005, Rotary International funded a small net retreatment programme which could also make lower quality nets into permanently impregnated nets. The exercise revealed the great lack of nets in households and so in the later half of 2006 and early 2007, Rotary paid for a further 1,500 long lasting impregnated nets (LLINs). The public private partnership in this situation was between the clinic and an international donor (USAID), although the AFFORD health marketing initiative, Malaria Consortium and NetShoppe were the parties the clinic dealt with. The nets were being made available to collaborating partners at a price that was about half that in the retail outlets. This meant the clinic could buy twice as many nets as could have been achieved. The nets were given out free of charge to mothers attending our ante-natal classes and to guardians of children attending child immunisation sessions. HIV counselling and testing The provision of free-to-client HIV counselling and testing was an early addition to the basic maternity and fever management when the old clinic started. Just prior to the new facility opening in July 2005, the Ministry of Health department for PMTCT was providing test kits when available, but the clinic otherwise had to purchase them. The cost of US$1‚Äì2 per test could not be passed on to clients based on experience that even after counselling for an hour and being willing to test, that cost was still a barrier to access health care. In March 2006, the public private linkages with the Aids Control Programme of the Ministry of Health were evidenced by the accreditation of Hope Clinic Lukuli as an Anti-retroviral Treatment Centre and therefore able to access commodity support from the government. They in turn were supported by the Global Fund for Aids, TB and Malaria and by the US Government. In June 2006 Hope Clinic Lukuli received a six-month supply of three different test kits for HIV and our client numbers grew rapidly to over 150 a month by the start of 2007. All free of charge to the client. HIV care and support Another aspect of public private partnership has been the collaboration between Hope Clinic Lukuli as an independent NGO and the large, national government or donor funded programmes and organisations. Particularly in the HIV sector, the early stages of mobilisation, awareness and post-test care and support is not delivered by government. In mid-2006, The Joint Clinical Research Centre (JCRC) entered into an agreement with Hope Clinic Lukuli to provide the technical skills and experience of the world-renowned JCRC TREAT project to the community in Lukuli. The fortnightly visits quickly revealed a massive underserved population including many who had wished to confirm their expected HIV positive status but had previously been unable to. The partnership between the publicly and donor funded JCRC and the private Hope Clinic Lukuli has meant that Hope Clinic Lukuli has 180 PLHA receiving fortnightly check-ups near their homes and in the interim can access Hope Clinic Lukuli for examinations and check-ups. Guardians of children can collect their ARVs from the clinic which have been provided by JCRC. Maternal and reproductive health The Hope Clinic Lukuli was recognised by the Kampala City Council as being deserving of financial support for the July 2006 to June 2007 financial year. The public private support has been in three forms from the city. A lump sum contribution to our operational overheads and staff costs was made to the equivalent of one month's net salary for the medical team. A smaller amount was deposited by the city council to the Joint Medical Stores from whom we procure our drugs and medical consumables. The credit line amounts to only 10% of monthly drug costs but the clinic has applied it to the various items used for maternity ante-natal and deliveries. This helps maintain a low cost of US$15 to deliver a baby including the overnight stay in a private delivery room. The third support is the provision of free family planning items including oral and injectable contraceptives. HIV and STI medications Support from the health ministry, donors, large programmes and the city council is coordinated at Hope Clinic Lukuli with support from the private non-health sector in the form of sponsorship of staff and services. The considerable in-kind support from Ugandan companies in 2004 and 2005 enabled the new health facility to be built to a high standard and repeat donations in 2007 are helping maintain its appearance. Each year since 2005, the private, commercial Aggreko international has been supporting the HIV, maternity, child and youth health services. Their donations of funds are critical as, in 2005 and 2006, they paid the salary of the counsellor providing the free HIV counselling and testing service. The kits from the government are only half of the cost facing Hope Clinic Lukuli and so Aggreko ensure the clinic can offer that service free of charge. The DFCU Group has a strong community interest in HIV within its banking group. They have supported Hope Clinic Lukuli to enhance its laboratory with a complete upgrade from the equipment transferred from the old clinic premises. They also contributed to the cost of a medical VSO who has formalised the clinical protocols for maternal health, fever management, STIs and opportunistic infections associated with HIV. The 2007 support from Aggreko has been to address an issue identified in community outreach visits from Hope Clinic Lukuli and endorsed by the Assistant Commissioner for Reproductive Health in the Ministry, Dr Twa Twa. The youth were unable to access cash from their parents, and some HIV clients lacked any access to funds with which to seek consultation, testing and any medication for STIs. For the youth, puberty and early sexual activity can lead to a huge risk of STI which either risk future reproductive health problems or more exposure to HIV infection. Once HIV infected, STI are a frequent complaint and can cause re-infection. Aggreko responded to this need and so a private commercial company is funding a government/ publicly endorsed need to deliver a service in the independent NGO, Hope Clinic Lukuli. Local partnerships The Hope Clinic Lukuli has benefited from a four-month community outreach programme to identify HIV peer educators and support groups as well as private sector drug shops and self- employed midwives. The resulting referral network has encouraged midwives offering ANC services to refer women to deliver at the clinic as well as to visit the clinic for their PMTCT HIV test. Drugs shops who feel they have exhausted their medical treatment or diagnosis capacity can refer patients for a check-up. The public private partnership here is also three way cooperation with government and the clinic as an NGO. The referred patient is examined and diagnosed at Hope Clinic Lukuli but then encouraged to take their prescription for medication back to the drug shop thereby ensuring that they maintain their trade. This is a good example of competitive advantage as some referred clients also get to access the free services available at Hope Clinic Lukuli and pay for the laboratory but still get syrups and tablets from the local shop.

His younger brother Erhard was also a conductor and composer.  Career  Mauersberger conducting the Dresdner Kreuzchor, Wartburg 1954 The ruins of the Kreuzkirche in 1945 After positions in Aachen and Eisenach, he became director of the renowned Dresdner Kreuzchor in 1930, a position he held until his death. In May 1933, Mauersberger became a member of the Nazi Party;Fred K. Prieberg: Handbuch Deutsche Musiker 1933‚Äì1945, CD-Rom-Lexikon, Kiel 2004, p. 4.492. there are strong indications though that he tried to minimize the influence of the NS- Ideology and in particular of the Hitler-Jugend onto the choir. He refused to stage NS-songs with the choir,Dieter H√§rtwig/Matthias Herrmann (edits.): \\"Der Dresdner Kreuzchor\\"; Ev. Verlagsanstalt, Leipzig 2006, and continued to perform the works of banned composers such as Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy and G√ºnter Raphael, at least as late as 1938. Probably his most famous work is the motet Wie liegt die Stadt so w√ºst (How desolate lies the city), written after the destruction of Dresden in February 1945. The text is taken from the Lamentations of Jeremiah, verses 1,1.4.9.13; 2,15; 5,17.20‚Äì21.

A remake of the game, X-Change 2 R was later produced by Crowd, but Peach Princess has stated they do not intend to market this game.  Synopsis  In X-Change 2, the player plays as Takuya Aihara, a student at Miyanomori Chemistry School who is afraid about changing into \\"a new, partially familiar self\\". When a strange chemical turns her thoughts into Maiko's last year, the player has a bizarre string of experiences and has her thoughts in his or her brain. One year later, Takuya is enjoying her school life with Asuka, her best friend. A chemistry club member Chisato uses Takuya for a new experiment, which turns Takuya's thoughts around again. As a girl, Takuya finds she is more popular than before but with practically everyone around her asking to be with her. This dating-sim adventure features a large number of characters as the game goes on. The shy boy Kouji, whose virginity Takuya took last year on the roof of the school, has him waiting for his chance all the time. The teacher Mr. Sano, who is known for his interest in his students, is curious about you. While all this is going on, Takuya tries to keep her relationship with Asuka intact.  Gameplay  As the game unfolds, the player makes various decisions at set in the game. These choices lead to different interactions with the multiple characters throughout the game. Throughout the game the character is worried and has unusual moments with many different people. Some examples of the familiar scenes related to the original games include: being seriously discovered by Koji while waiting for Takuya's school uniform to dry, the substitute teacher looking closely at the main character in the school equipment room, Mr. Terada is feeling weird while he conducts a uniform inspection after finding out that she came to school looking all dirty, and Takuya following around a student during a tutoring session. The game has multiple endings, some with Takuya returning to his real self and remaining with Asuka, and others where he chooses another person to make friends with instead or even no one at all. There is also the option to remain with Maiko's real self as Takuya becomes more and more comfortable with these emotions and the sensations which come with it, sometimes staying with one of the characters in the game. = Main Characters = *Takuya Aihara (Áõ∏ÂéüÊãì‰πü/„Åü„Åè„ÇÑ): The main character.

Reception On July 22, 2006, Peter Payne admitted that Peach Princess had censored the English release of X-Change 3. A total of seven graphics had been removed from the game due to them being of a lolicon nature. Two other graphics were edited to remove tears, blood, and other details from a rape scene. An unknown number of speech and sound effects were removed, and the amount of dialog changed during the translation/conversion is unknown. In addition, a sequence referring to the foreskin was deleted from a scene with two boys, but only audio and text were affected. Peach Princess later released a patch restoring some of the content.

The female variant, held by the spouses of the kouropalatai, was kouropalatissa. History and nature of the title The title is first attested (as curapalati) in the early 5th century, as an official of vir spectabilis rank under the castrensis palatii, charged with the maintenance of the imperial palace (cf. Western European \\"majordomo\\").. When Emperor Justinian I (r. 527‚Äì565) made his nephew and heir Justin II curopalates in 552, however, the office took on new significance, and became one of the most exalted dignities, ranking next to Caesar and nobilissimus and, like them, reserved initially for members of the imperial family. Unlike them, however, it later came to be granted to important foreign rulers, mostly in the Caucasus. Thus, from the 580s to the 1060s, sixteen Georgian ruling princes and kings held that honorific, as well as, after 635, several Armenian dynasts.. According to the Klƒìtorologion of Philotheos, written in 899, the insignia of the rank were a red tunic, mantle and belt. Their award by the Byzantine emperor signified the elevation of the recipient to the office.. By the 11th‚Äì12th century, the dignity had lost its earlier significance:. it was granted as an honorary title to generals outside the imperial family, and its functions were gradually being supplanted by the protovestiarios, whose original role was limited to the custody of the imperial wardrobe..

This was made on a case by case basis to select individuals but also to groups of people, most notably East Asians who were ascribed as honorary whites. Japanese, Koreans and Taiwanese were granted this honorary white status, and later on other Chinese and individually designated figures of various other races were added as well. Japanese The designation was ascribed to all Japanese people (who also once were ascribed as Honorary Aryans by Nazi Germany) in the 1960s. This designation assisted a trade pact formed between South Africa and Japan in the early 1960s when Tokyo's Yawata Iron & Steel Co. offered to purchase 5 million tonnes of South African pig iron, worth more than $250 million, over a 10-year period.South Africa: Honorary Whites, TIME, 19 January 1962 With such a huge deal in the works, Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd determined that it would be tactless and disadvantageous to trade arrangements to subject the Japanese people to the same restrictions as other ethnicities because trade delegations from Japan would regularly visit South Africa for business. Afterward, Pretoria's Group Areas Board publicly announced that all Japanese people would be considered white. Johannesburg's city officials even decided that, \\"in view of the trade agreements\\", the municipal swimming pools would be open to all Japanese guests. The designation gave Japanese almost all of the same rights and privileges as whites (except for the right to vote; they were also exempt from conscription). Until the early 1970s, opposition party politicians and the press questioned why Japanese were granted special privileges, citing inconsistencies with apartheid.Afro-Hispanic Review: White, Honorary White, or Non-White: Apartheid Era Constructions of Chinese, Dr. Yoon Jung Park (Univ of Johannesburg), Spring 2008 Chinese The new designation granted to the Japanese seemed grossly unfair to South Africa's small Chinese community (roughly 7,000 at that time), who it seemed, would enjoy none of the new benefits given to the Japanese. As Time reported one of Cape Town's leading Chinese businessmen's saying \\"If anything, we are whiter in appearance than our Japanese friends.\\" Another indignantly demanded: \\"Does this mean that the Japanese, now that they are [considered] White, cannot associate with us without running afoul of the Immorality Act?\\" Inclusion of other East Asians as honorary whites (Japanese, South Korean and especially Taiwanese) complicated matters on how the Chinese were treated, and apartheid regulation on Chinese varied from department to department and province to province as locals could not distinguish these Asians apart from each other. In 1984, the Group Areas Act was amended to allow Chinese South Africans to live in areas the government had declared white areas and use the facilities within them. Chinese South Africans were required to apply for a permit from the government in order to move into a white area. Permission had to be obtained from all the neighbours in the suburb for the application to be accepted. South Koreans Unlike Japan, South Korea was unwilling to establish diplomatic relations with South Africa because of apartheid.In Search of a Better Life: A History of Korean Migration to Cape Town , Kim Mino, University of Cape Town, page 7 South Africa offered honorary white status to South Korean citizens when the two countries negotiated diplomatic relations in 1961. South Korea severed ties with South Africa in 1978 in protest against apartheid, and full diplomatic relations between the two countries were not reestablished until 1992. Taiwanese The inclusion of Taiwanese was due to the important relations between South Africa and Taiwan. By 1979, Taiwan had become South Africa's fifth largest trading partner. As South Africa continued to support the Chinese Nationalists even after the Chinese Communist Party gained control of the mainland, the relations of the two warmed as both were isolated from the international community. Others The \\"honorary white\\" status was given to other special visitors belonging to other races, including: * Guyanese author E. R. Braithwaite who wrote a scathing book Honorary White: Visit to South Africa about his stay; * Cricketers in the West Indian rebel teams; * Players of Maori or Samoan backgrounds in the 1970 touring All Blacks rugby team; * Australian Aboriginal tennis player Evonne Goolagong Cawley. * African American tennis player Arthur Ashe was also offered Honorary White status but he refused and explicitly demanded to be booked as a black man when he visited and played in South Africa.\\"Remembering Arthur Ashe\\" Society of North American Sports Historians * Malawian diplomats See also * Honorary Aryan * Honorary male * Model minority * Racial hierarchy * Takao Ozawa v.

It contains about 500 - mostly marine - species grouped into 42 genera. They may be commonly called ragworms or clam worms. Characteristics The prostomium of Nereididae bears a pair of palps that are differentiated into two units, the proximal unit is much larger than the distal unit. Parapodia are mostly biramous (only the first two pairs are uniramous). Peristomium fused with the first body segment, with usually two pairs of tentacular cirri. The first body segment with 1-2 pairs tentacular cirri without aciculae. Compound setae present. Notopodia are distinct (rarely reduced), usually with more flattened lobes, notosetae compound falcigers and/or spinigers (rarely notosetae absent). They have two prostomial antennae (absent in Micronereis). Their pharynx, when everted, clearly consists of two portions, with a pair of strong jaws on the distal portion and usually with conical teeth on one or more areas of both portions. Most genera have no gills (if present, they are usually branched and arise on mid-anterior segments of body). The larval body consists of four segments. =Jaw material= Ragworms' teeth are made of a very tough, yet lightweight material. Unlike bone and tooth enamel, this is not mineralised with calcium, but is formed by a histidine rich protein, with bound zinc ions.Broomell et al.

Research on this material could lead to applications in engineering.Marine Worm's Jaws Say 'Cutting-Edge New Aerospace Materials' Science Daily Systematics Nereididae are currently considered a monophyletic taxon. Their closest neighbours in polychaete phylogenetic tree are Chrysopetalidae and Hesionidae (the superfamily Nereidoidea). Nereididae are divided into 42 genera, but the relationships between them are as yet unclear. The family contains traditionally three subfamilies - Namanereidinae, Gymnonereinae and Nereidinae. Ecology Ragworms are predominantly marine organisms that may occasionally swim upstream to rivers and even climb to land (for example Lycastopsis catarractarum). They are commonly found in all water depths, foraging in seaweeds, hiding under rocks or burrowing in sand or mud. Ragworms are mainly omnivorous but many are active carnivores. Nereids only breed once before dying (semelparity) and most of them morph into a distinct form to breed (epitoky).

When Dinosaurs Roamed America premiered to 5 million viewers and aired numerous times on the Discovery HD Theater's opening lineup in 2002. It was released on VHS and DVD in August 2001, and had a number of re-releases on DVD since then. When Dinosaurs Roamed America also had a limited Region 2 release on Blu-ray in 2011, bundled with Valley of the T. Rex.https://www.blu- ray.com/movies/Valley-of-the-T-Rex-When-Dinosaurs-Roamed-America-Blu- ray/23439/ Production When Dinosaurs Roamed America was directed by Pierre de Lespinoishttps://web.archive.org/web/20011021122415/http://www.apple.com:80/hotnews/articles/2001/07/dinosaur/ with Evergreen Films, and was narrated by actor John Goodman (voice of Rex in We're Back! A Dinosaur Story). The featured dinosaurs were designed by paleo- artist and art director Mark Dubeau, noted for creating dinosaurs for many other Discovery Channel and National Geographic specials. The dinosaur animation was accomplished by animator Don Waller at Meteor Studios, in Montreal, Canada, while the music was composed by Christopher Franke (ex- member from Tangerine Dream). Unlike Walking with Dinosaurs, the show's creatures are almost entirely composed of computer-generated imagery, and is also one of the first documentaries to depict dromaeosaurs and therizinosaurs with nearly full coats of feathers. The program was shot in high definition for better portability and quality. Exotic HD cameras were rare at the time, which made reaching some of the filming locations for When Dinosaurs Roamed America (which include various parts of Argentina, Tasmania, and Florida) difficult, however the portable HD cameras allowed de Lespinois and his small team to capture never-before-seen shots of the various landscapes. The show was edited using an offline system rather than online.

Synopsis =Late Triassic segment (220 million years ago)= *Coelophysis *Rutiodon *Desmatosuchus *Icarosaurus *Traversodont *Mammal (live-acted by an eastern quoll) *Locust The program starts in the Late Triassic, near modern- day New York City in the Newark Supergroup. The narrator explains how the Permian mass extinction led to new forms of life, including, eventually, the most extraordinary creatures ever to walk the planet, the dinosaurs. The camera tracks a Coelophysis through the woods. The program depicts Coelophysis as preying mainly on small animals, such as insects and Icarosaurus. It encounters other, larger non-dinosaurian archosaurs such as Rutiodon and Desmatosuchus. The quick Coelophysis is portrayed as a very successful inhabitant of this world. =Early Jurassic segment (200 million years ago)= *Dilophosaurus *Coelophysis kayentakatae (identified by its synonym Syntarsus) *Anchisaurus The program moves on to the Early Jurassic of Pennsylvania, showing a pack of Syntarsus.Coelophysis rhodesiensis is referred to in this program as Syntarsus. These dinosaurs, closely related to Coelophysis, are hunting the primitive herbivorous dinosaur Anchisaurus; one of the Syntarsus is killed when the initial attack fails, and they are chased away by a Dilophosaurus, which kills the Anchisaurus to feed her young. A second Dilophosaurus arrives as well, and after a short but vicious fight it is driven away, allowing the first Dilophosaurus and her young to feed in peace. The narrator then explains Syntarsus and Dilophosaurus will become the gigantic carnivores such as Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, while Anchisaurus will become the sauropods. =Late Jurassic segment (150 million years ago)= *Apatosaurus *Dryosaurus *Ceratosaurus *Stegosaurus *Camarasaurus *Allosaurus *Pterosaur (possibly represented by either Comodactylus or Rhamphorhynchus) The show skips to prehistoric Utah during the Late Jurassic period. The region has been engulfed by a severe drought as the seasonal rain has failed to arrive. A predatory Ceratosaurus stalks a family of Dryosaurus, including a mother and two youngsters. The predator eventually breaks its cover and charges after the small dinosaurs as they scatter. The Dryosaurus can only flee but the Ceratosaurus is quicker than they are and catches up, grabbing and killing one of the juveniles. The Ceratosaurus feasts while the others escape into a grove of pine trees and run into a herd of sauropods called Camarasaurus. They will be safe around the gentle giants. A male Stegosaurus fights off the attacking Ceratosaurus, the same individual from the earlier sequence, later on using his spiked tail and follows a female Stegosaurus by constantly displaying his plates. Eventually, the female decides that he is a healthy individual and the two mate. With the onset of the rainy season, a herd of Apatosaurus arrive, followed by an Allosaurus who launches an assault against the herd while the sauropods graze but is unsuccessful due to their size and strength. The Allosaurus subsequently kills the Ceratosaurus that attacked the Dryosaurus and finally is able to feed. Later while on the move, one Apatosaurus stumbles over a fallen tree and tumbles off of a 20 foot high cliff. The sauropod is injured with a broken leg, and its agonized bellowing is picked up by a pack of hungry Allosaurus. When the Allosaurus arrive, they begin to eat the sauropod alive. =Mid Cretaceous segment (90 million years ago)= * Dromaeosaur Based on a Suskityrannus specimen https://twitter.com/Acheroraptor1/status/1125532708103438338 *Nothronychus *Zuniceratops *Suskityrannus (identified as coelurosaur) The program then shows a forest located in New Mexico during the Middle Cretaceous period. Small predatory coelurosaurs scamper through the foliage and steal pieces of meat from a dead Zuniceratops. This smaller cousin of Triceratops had been killed by raptors and the hungry dinosaurs are feasting. The raptors chase off a lone dromaeosaur as it tries to steal some meat. The lone dromaeosaur then tries to attack a grazing Nothronychus, only to be slashed by its long claws and knocked over. Uninjured, the raptor retreats. An old male Zuniceratops is battling for dominance with a younger but healthier male whilst the herd members look on. The younger dinosaur gores the older herd leader with its right horn, wounding its frill. The sounds of battle are picked up by raptors and the hungry creatures follow the sounds to a clearing and watch from the foliage as the battle plays out before attacking. The injured Zuniceratops is attacked by the pack of dromaeosaurs and is fatally wounded. Another Zuniceratops headbutts the attacking dromaeosaur and tosses it off the struggling male. The dromaeosaurs retreat but the old Zuniceratops will not last long. Weeks later, a thunderstorm blows in and lightning illuminates the darkened skies. Panicked dinosaurs scatter but the old Zuniceratops cannot get up. As it sounds its distress call, the dromaeosaurs return joined by a fourth member and surround the wounded dinosaur. The raptors attack and soon kill it. Meanwhile, lightning ignites the dry vegetation. Fire springs up, and most of the dinosaurs scatter in all directions. Zuniceratops panic for safety and the Nothronychus follows. However, the feasting dromaeosaurs are too distracted by eating and fire surrounds the region. One of the four raptors burn to death along with it's prey. But the other raptors do flee and make it to safety along with some of the other creatures. =Late Cretaceous segment (65 million years ago)= *Tyrannosaurus *Triceratops *Edmontosaurus (identified as its former synonym Anatotitan) *Quetzalcoatlus *Ornithomimus (unidentified; revealed on website) *Purgatorius (live-acted by opossums) *Turtle (live- acted) *Bird (live-acted) *Spider (live-acted) The program explains that dinosaurs similar to Zuniceratops evolved into the famous Triceratops. In the Late Cretaceous near Mt. Rushmore in South Dakota, Anatotitan and Triceratops browse on a rolling grassland bordered by tropical jungle, while Ornithomimus peck at roots and other plants in the area. Flying pterosaurs such as Quetzalcoatlus soar overhead, looking for carcasses. A young Tyrannosaurus rex arrives on the scene, and the Triceratops form a defensive circle around the juveniles and display their powerful horns whilst the Tyrannosaurus attempts to get through and roars repeatedly but the Triceratops stay to fight instead of fleeing. Unable to get past the horns of the defensive Triceratops, the Tyrannosaurus attacks a Quetzalcoatlus, but the pterosaur launches off and flies away from the hungry theropod. The Tyrannosaurus goes back into the trees and the Triceratops become less agitated. At night, the young Tyrannosaurus returns to its family, and the mother Tyrannosaurus chastises two of her young after they hit her scarred leg while sparring. The next day, the young Tyrannosaurus and its siblings are taught by their mother to hunt. They target a herd of Anatotitan grazing in a forest clearing and after bursting from the trees, the herd scatters and flees. The three Tyrannosaurus chase after one individual and it runs straight into the forest where the mother emerges from the bushes, and, grabbing it, killing the unfortunate hadrosaur by breaking its neck. She then roars before the feast begins. As they begin to feast, a huge asteroid, 6 miles across, hurtles towards the planet at 45000 miles an hour and as it enters the atmosphere friction turns it into a blazing missile. The asteroid crosses the ocean in just 4 minutes, crashing into the Gulf of Mexico. The impact gouges out a crater 120 miles wide and sends an incandescent plume of dust, glass and ash into the atmosphere which falls back to earth as fiery debris. The blast wave radiates outward from the impact in a circle and in minutes, everything for hundreds of miles is incinerated by the intense heat or blown apart by the blast wave. Dinosaurs in the region are vaporized in a matter of minutes. In North America, plants and animals suffer a different fate. Some are incinerated by the mounting heat whilst others succumb to shock waves generated by the collision. Fleeing Triceratops and Anatotitan are caught by the speeding ejecta cloud and destroyed. The feasting Tyrannosaurs watch in horror as a burning blast wave hurtles towards them and flee as pieces of fiery rock rain down. Eventually, all the region's dinosaurs die including the Tyrannosaurus family. A few hours after impact, a heavy cloud of dust and ash settles over America, and temperatures drop as sunlight and heat can no longer reach the surface of the planet. Gasses such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide are burned by the heat and are washed out of the atmosphere as acid rain. Two months after impact, the sun finally reaches the surface as the heavy cloud of ash clears away. The disaster is over, but 90% of all leaf bearing trees, ferns, vines and plants have been obliterated, and 70% of the animals have died out. Most dinosaurs are extinct. Despite the depressing and traumatic event, life is described as being resilient, and a turtle is shown emerging from the water and a bird flies overhead, explained by the narrator as the only dinosaurs left. Out of the ashes and charred debris, several small possum-like mammals (Purgatorius) emerge, and the narrator explains that small mammals such as these will eventually evolve into humans, and think back in awe to a time \\"when dinosaurs roamed America\\".

Habitat and Distribution  The nautilus is reported to live on the coastal reefs of Baliand Papa New Guinea. There and has been reported to live in nearby deep-water habitats as well.

Markings indicate that the nautilus obtained are shells that have drifted onto the shoreline. Likely due to predation by Octopus, the shells are empty upon arrival. Due to the A. scrobiculatus specimen being isolated in the region of Papa New Guinea, in addition to being close relatives, it is thought that both species of the nautilus are organisms that are isolated geographically.  Commercial use of shells  Known to be valued in the commercial market as collectibles, nautilus shells and are traded around the world. A. perforatus are traded locally in Bali, Indonesia. These markets tend to last for a brief period of time before eventually becoming nonfunctional. In addition to their trading and commercial value as souvenirs, shells are also owned by museums for collection.  Taxonomy  Little is known about wild specimens of A. perforatus and this nautilus has mostly been distinguished by shells that have drifted onto land. Thus, not much is known about this particular creature. The genus Allonautilus contains only two species; A.perforatus and A. scrobiculatus. Due to its geographically isolated nature, the genus overall tends to be more restricted in distribution than Nautilus  Morphology  Like other nautilus species, A.perforatus has a coiled shell, shell covering its internal body. The shell has multiple chambers, the outermost chamber being where the nautilus lives. In addition the organism possesses tentacles that form two rings around its mouth. A. perforatus shows a shell shape and coloration very similar to that of A. scrobiculatus and shares with this species the characteristic open umbilicus. However, it bears highly distinctive shell-ribbing, which is unique among extant ectocochliate cephalopods, and lacks scrobiculate shell sculpture. It is not known whether A. perforatus possesses the thick encrusting layer (periostracum) characteristic of A. scrobiculatus. Maximum known shell diameter is around 180 mm.Jereb, P. 2005.

The king exempted these titleholders from normal colonial administration; the donat√°rios were comparable to a royal governor or a British Lord Proprietor. As the donataria were often captaincies, the position is also translated as captain. History A anonymous Venetian map of the islands of the Azores (Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana), Venice Normally, the donat√°rio was the recipient of a captaincy, a territorial division and land grant, within Portuguese colonies. It was an effective administrative system that ceded certain rights and responsibilities to the donat√°rio, facilitating the settlement of unpopulated places with little cost to the Crown.Susana Goulart Costa (2008), p.231 The donat√°rio was obligated to govern his territories under specific terms: in exchange for the grant, he received tax immunity, but was also responsible for promoting and settling new residents to his territory, establishing churches (following the Catholic faith), protecting them from frequent pirate attacks, and promoting agriculture and commerce. While the donat√°rio assumed expenses of the settlement and economic development, he also benefited from various judicial and fiscal privileges, while the King maintained certain unalienable rights to safeguard the territorial and political unity of the Kingdom. Except for private land grants, the territory administrated by the donat√°rio was turned over to settlers and the bestowed was responsible for all the expenses of the Captaincy. Almost dictatorial in their powers, the donat√°rios were limited by the difficulties of the territories they governed. With the Brazilian territories, which were large, the donat√°rios' obligations covered the governorship, expansion and settlement of the territory, necessitating a large labour force, security forces and administrators. Many of the new settlers were criminals, opportunists or political exiles who arrived in these territories to make their fortunes (commercially or politically). At the same time, the donat√°rio promoted the faith by receiving and assisting the Catholic missionaries that trekked across the Portuguese Empire. =Donat√°rios= After their discovery, the islands of the Azores were bestowed by the Crown of Portugal to Prince Henry the Navigator, son of King Jo√£o I, who in turn donated them to the Order of Christ, of which he was master. The order of succession remained in the hands of the Dukes of Viseu and progressed as follows: * Infante Henry, 1st Duke of Viseu, (1432-1460) * Infante Ferdinand, 2nd Duke of Viseu (1460-1470) * Infante John, 3rd Duke of Viseu (1470-1472) * Infante Diogo, 4th Duke of Viseu (1472-1484) * Infante Manuel, 5th Duke of Viseu (1484-1495) The Dukes were the direct line to the Crown, paying vassalage as serfs to the Kings of Portugal. When Manuel, 5th Duke of Viseu, ascended the throne as King Manuel I of Portugal (1495), he incorporated the donatary privileges of the seven islands of the Azores (Corvo and Flores were not included) into the properties and possessions of the Crown. The donatary system was bestowed upon Henry the Navigator at an unknown time, but his order to introduce livestock (goats, cattle, pigs, etc.) on the islands suggests that he would have received jurisdiction between 1432 and 1438.Susana Goulart Costa (2008), p.232 This was the same period as the death of King Duarte, and his successor King Afonso V exempted fees and taxes for five years at his request, suggesting Henry's compliance with the duties of a donat√°rio. Yet it was only in his last will and testament that it was explicitly stated that he was protector of the Azores. The transfer of this title to his nephew the Infante Ferdinand, was in keeping with the Lei Mental proclaimed by his brother in 1434, that bound Henry to pass on all lands and goods from the King to legitimate male descendants. If not, then the Crown would regain ownership. The donat√°rio was expected to promote the settlement of the territory. Consequently, the hierarchical model that developed was an extension of this process. In order to govern the islands, Henry as donat√°rio nominated men of confidence, capit√£es do donat√°rio (Captains of the Donatary), to administer their territories locally. This three-tier system worked effectively: King, donat√°rio, and captains allowed the administration of overseas territories without direct intervention of the Crown. Yet the Crown oscillated between total neglect and strong vigilance; between the 15th-18th centuries the monarchy did not really know how to manage its territories.Susana Goulart Costa (2008), p.233 King Manuel I of Portugal, for his part, was a micro- manager and was involved in judicial affairs and exercised his duties as lord of the islands. This led to the creation of monarchial posts to directly influence control, such as the Corregedor, the Provedoria das Armadas (Office of the Purveyor of Armadas), 1527, and the Feitorias (Customs Offices) of Angra and Ponta Delgada, in 1561.Susana Goulart Costa (2008), p.234 These new posts showed the importance of the Crown's representatives in the regions over their control, and men like Cipriano de Figueiredo e Vasconcelos (Corregador of Terceira) would play important roles in coexistence between local and national administration. After the 16th century the figure of the donatary captain lost its effective governorship in most of the islands of the Azores, with the exception of S√£o Miguel, which was transformed into an honorific post, conferred by the King to people and noble families who he wished to honour. It was through this system that the majority of donatary captaincies fell into the hands of the high nobility of Portugal, who never lived on the islands or had little economic interest in their development.

New College Lane is a historic street in central Oxford, England, named after New College, one of the older Oxford colleges, adjacent to the north. In 2010, New College Lane was named Britain's fourth most picturesque street, as part of Google's Street View Awards. Description At the northwestern end of New College Lane is a junction with Catte Street, with the Sheldonian Theatre opposite. The main feature is the Bridge of Sighs, a covered bridge connecting two parts of Hertford College, which was completed in 1914 and attracts many tourists for the view. Also to the north is a small alley leading past some of the historic city wall to the Turf Tavern, a hidden but favourite public house for students and tourists. The lane has three bends as it winds its way between the surrounding colleges. There is a rear entrance to New College. The lane is largely surrounded by high stone walls, with few windows. Some good examples of gargoyles can be seen, a feature of Oxford college architecture. At its southeastern end, the lane continues as Queen's Lane, named after Queen's College to the south and west. There is a gate in the road at this point to prevent through traffic. Historic Markers A plaque on a terraced house on the north side of the lane records that it was occupied by Edmond Halley, after whom Halley's Comet is named. Residents Past and present residents of the lane include: * Emily Benn - Labour Parliamentary candidate. * Edmond Halley - English Astronomer Royal known for computing the orbit of Halley's Comet.

It was released as a B-side on the UK #1 single \\"Some Might Say\\" along with \\"Acquiesce\\" and \\"Headshrinker\\" and appears on the B-side compilation album, The Masterplan, as well. In the United States, it was released as one of the B-sides to \\"Wonderwall\\". This song also appears in remastered form on the 2014 deluxe version of (What's the Story) Morning Glory?. Background and inspiration \\"Talk Tonight\\" is one of many acoustic B-side tracks sung by Noel. It was inspired by the near-breakup of the band in Los Angeles in autumn 1994, when Noel walked out without telling anyone and headed for San Francisco. He stayed with a girl he had befriended during a previous show there. According to the sleeve notes to The Masterplan, she talked a distraught Noel \\"off the ledge\\" and took him to the park where she had played as a child. It is also mentioned in the Oasis book by Paul Mathurs, Take Me There, that the girl also had an obsession with Snapple strawberry lemonade, which contributed to the line in the song, \\"all your dreams are made of strawberry lemonade.\\" In an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle in November 2016, Melissa Lim states she met Noel backstage at Bottom Of The Hill in 1994, recalling: \\"He came over and sat down next to me, I had never been backstage before, so I asked him, 'Where's the afterparty?' And he goes, 'What afterparty? Can I hang out with you tonight?'\\". Three days later, after a disastrous performance at Whisky A Go Go in Los Angeles, and after a dispute with Liam, Noel went to Lim's apartment in Nob Hill. \\"He was very upset,\\" said Lim. \\"I took him in, fed him and tried to calm him down. He wanted to break up the band. We went to Huntington Park to clear his mind. We listened to music. We went record shopping\\". After bringing back magazines and Snapple Strawberry Lemonade, Lim then convinced Noel to return to Oasis, \\"San Francisco has a reputation of being a place where bands come to die, like The Band and the Sex Pistols,\\" says Lim. \\"I wasn't going to let it happen on my watch. I told him, 'You can't leave the band ‚Äî you're on the verge of something big.'\\" In the film Supersonic, Noel claims not to remember Lim's name. Lim stated \\"Keith Richards can remember the name of his milkman from when he was 8 years old. I don't know what's going on with Noel, and that's fine. I was a part of something that touched so many people. That's good enough.\\" Other use The song also featured on the DVD Live By The Sea after Noel makes a mistake on the track \\"D'Yer Wanna Be A Spaceman?\\" and abandons the song. The song is also included on Oasis' compilation album Stop the Clocks. Paul Weller played keyboards when Oasis performed this song on Channel 4's The White Room in 1995.
