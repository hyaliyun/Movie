The Cube is a pop-up restaurant created by Electrolux. Since 2011, two versions of the restaurant have been located in different cities in Europe, where a number of guest celebrity chefs have brought teams and dishes from their own restaurants to cook in the spaces. Description Claude Bosi, at The Cube in London The Cube was designed by Park Associati design studio in Milan, and the construction covers a space of 140 m2. It has an outside balcony allowing for a 360-degree field of vision. The exterior shell is made of aluminium and has hexagonal shapes cut into the shell by laser in order to allow light into the interior. The pop-up restaurant acts as a promotional device for home appliance manufacturer Electrolux, and the restaurant is fitted out with their equipment. Two copies of The Cube were made, and they both tour Europe in a different city each year. During 2011, versions of the restaurant visited Milan and Brussels, while in 2012 they are in London and Stockholm. The restaurant proved so popular in London that it was announced in September 2012 that the restaurant would stay in the city until 31 January 2013. There are further plans for the restaurant to visit Switzerland and Russia. In each city, the restaurant is placed on top of a monument; in Brussels it was on top of the triumphal arch at the Parc du Cinquantenaire, in Milan by the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, in London it is located on top of the Southbank Centre. Celebrity chefs from those countries have been brought into the spaces in order to demonstrate the cooking they normally produce at their own restaurants. These have included Michelin star chefs such as two starred Bart De Pooter from Pastorale, Claude Bosi from Hibiscus and Daniel Clifford from Midsummer House. Reception During its stay in London, John O'Ceallaigh of The Daily Telegraph ate at The Cube while Daniel Clifford was in residence. He thought that as a \\"promotional vehicle it makes much more impact than a display stand in Currys\\", but at the end of his meal he departed reluctantly, saying \\"I‚Äôm not usually a fan of corporate pop-ups but, for those who can afford it, Electrolux has created something special.\\" Lisa Markwell for The Independent whilst Sat Bains was cooking and described the space as \\"dazzling\\", and gave the location a score of eight out of ten.

It was first exhibited at the British Institution in February 1821 and won a prize of ¬£200 for the best picture. It was so popular that it needed to be protected from the crowds by a railing, and established Martin's fame. In the words of Martin's biographer William Feaver, he \\"turned literary references to visual reality\\". Martin published mezzotint engravings in 1826 and 1832. The original painting is now held in a private collection; two smaller contemporaneous \\"sketches\\" are held by the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven, Connecticut and the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Connecticut. The subject The Biblical episode depicted in the painting Belshazzar's Feast is described in the Book of Daniel. The Babylonian king Belshazzar is said to have defiled the sacred vessels of the enslaved Israelites by using them to serve wine at a banquet. The feast was then disturbed by the appearance of a divine hand, which wrote a glowing inscription on a wall the writing on the wall which was interpreted by the prophet Daniel as a portent of Belshazzar's doom. Belshazzar was killed that night, and Darius the Mede succeeded to his kingdom. History The painting is the second piece in a trilogy of paintings by Martin on Mesopotamian themes, starting with his The Fall of Babylon in 1819, and completed with his The Fall of Ninevah in 1828. It was inspired by a conversation with the American artist Washington Allston and perhaps also by a poem by Thomas Smart Hughes. It shows a panoramic view of a cavernous banqueting room with columns on both sides, decorated with signs of the zodiac. The hall is filled with crowds of feasting Babylonians and is open to the sky, with the Hanging Gardens of Babylon above, and the Tower of Babel and a ziggurat visible in the background, lit by the moon revealed by a break in dark swirling clouds. The architecture is inspired by Egyptian, Babylonian and Indian styles. Dressed in black, Daniel stands at the centre of the foreground, interpreting the supernatural writing on the wall of the hall. Belshazzar recoils in astonishment and dread to his right, and others look on in shock and horror. Martin published an accompanying pamphlet with a key to help viewers to interpret the painting and identify the figures and structures. Although popular with the public, Martin's painting was not a critical success. There was appreciation of the magnificent architecture and emotional content, of the scale and bold colours of the work, but criticism of his painterly technique and particularly the execution of the figures. Charles Lamb called it vulgar and bombastic. Martin sold the painting to his former master, glass painter William Collins, for 1000 guineas before the exhibition in 1821, and Collins made Martin agree not to reproduce the painting until Collins sold it. The Duke of Buckingham and Chandos offered Martin 800 guineas; disappointed, he commissioned Martin to paint The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum instead. Collins sent the painting on an extensive tour of Britain, and it was wildly successful. By 1826, the accompanying pamphlet had reached its 45th edition. Martin was preparing to publish an engraved version in 1826, when Collins sued under the agreement not to reproduce the painting. Martin successfully claimed that he was reproducing his preliminary sketches, not the finished work, and versions of his engraving were published in 1826, in 1832, and for his Illustrations of the Bible project in 1835. The painting was bought by Liverpool merchant John Naylor in 1848. It was damaged in 1854 on its journey to Naylor's gallery at Leighton Hall near Welshpool, when the cart transporting it was hit by a train, but the painting was quickly repaired. It was rejected by the National Gallery as being too large and is now part of a private collection.Myrone, Martin [ed.], John Martin: Apocalypse, London, Tate publishing, 2011, pp. 99‚Äì101. . It was exhibited in 2011 at Tate Britain, next to a half-size () \\"sketch\\" made by the artist himself around 1820, now owned by the Yale Center for British Art.

Career  A youth product of Standard Li√®ge, he was signed by Luciano Gaucci at his club Perugia as part of the then-Serie A club's strategy to sign relatively unknown players from abroad. However, Maury never succeeded to break into the first team and was loaned out to Roda JC in November 2002, and then sold permanently to Serie C1 club Sambenedettese, owned by Gaucci as well at the time and mostly handled as a sort of Perugia reserve team, in 2003. After Gaucci's exit from Sambenedettese, Maury was sold to Serie C2 club Pro Vasto in 2004; this was followed by a number of moves within the lower ranks of Italian football until 2008, when he joined then-Serie C1 club Juve Stabia. After relegation in 2009, Maury opted to stay in and became a mainstay for the team and a protagonist in two back-to-back promotions that brought the small Campanian club to Serie B in 2011. Following that, he was also awarded team captaincy at Juve Stabia. In January 2013, Donovan Maury leaves Juve stabia to reach the luxembourgish BGL Ligue under the colors of F91 Dudelange.

The Night Train seizure was the largest single drug seizure in history at the time it occurred, and it remains one of the largest marijuana seizures made in the territorial waters of the United States. Operation Stopgap was one of the first inter-agency law enforcement efforts focused on the interdiction of illegal drugs from Central and South America, and it featured personnel of the Coast Guard, DEA and US Federal Marshals Service working together, as well as the resources of the Intelligence Section of the Drug Enforcement Administration and Coast Guard Intelligence (CGI). The Night Train was a 189-foot coastal cargo vessel that had become legendary in the law enforcement community and smuggling circles due to its repeated ability to elude US law enforcement for almost two years before they were finally captured off of West Palm Beach as the first seizure of Stopgap. Operation Stopgap was but the first of a number of highly successful inter- agency intelligence and interdiction operations that led to a large number of successful seizures and prosecutions in the late 1970s and early 1980s, garnering the U.S. Coast Guard considerable press coverage during this period as seizure records continued to be broken. Stopgap was also one of the earliest interdiction operations to effectively use satellite technology in the pursuit and interdiction of drug smugglers.

He was assassinated on the afternoon of 16 September 2012, reportedly by his wife, inside his home in Nezahualc√≥yotl. Serrano Cedillo's assassination came just two days after the slaying of Eduardo Castro Luque, a deputy in the state of Sonora and a member of the PRI. Unlike other political assassinations in Mexico, Serrano Cedillo's death did not bore the signs of organized crime, and was a result of \\"a series of deep\\" marital problems. Career and early life Born in 1967, Serrano Cedillo was a close collaborator of the State of Mexico's current governor, Eruviel √Åvila Villegas. Prior to his deputy nomination, Serrano Cedillo was the president of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in the municipality of Nezahualc√≥yotl and a former mayoral candidate for the same locality. He had also served as the Sub-secretary of the Interior in Greater Mexico City until May 2011. On 5 September 2012, Serrano Cedillo was sworn in as deputy for the XXV District of Nezahualc√≥yotl. Assassination Initial reports indicate that Serrano Cedillo left his house to buy a newspaper at a nearby booth and was stabbed in the chest by someone with a sharp weapon. Serrano Cedillo was reportedly coming out of a public restroom when the attacker surprised him. The assailant then managed to flee the scene and no arrests have been made. Serrano Cedillo, on the other hand, made his way home and was transported to a nearby hospital by his family where he was later pronounced dead. The Mexican authorities indicated on 20 September 2012 that Serrano Cedillo's wife, Patricia Grimaldo de la Cruz, reportedly assassinated her husband after having a dispute that same morning for \\"profound series of conjugal differences.\\" It was later proven that the assassination happed inside Serrano Cedillo's house and not outside his domicile, as previously stated. Unlike other political assassinations, Serrano Cedillo's death did not bore the signs of organized crime. Mexico's drug gangs typically target local leaders and police chiefs, not federal deputies. Moreover, stabbing is not typically a method Mexico's drug trafficking use to do their \\"dirty work,\\" hinting the officials that the deputy's death was a personal attack. He was the second PRI politician killed in just two days; Eduardo Castro Luque, a deputy-elect of the state of Sonora, was shot dead by unknown assailants on 14 September 2012. In August 2012, √âdgar Morales P√©rez of the PRI was also shot and killed by gunmen. =Funeral= After the Municipal Committee of the PRI paid tribute to the fallen Serrano Cedillo on 17 September 2012, he was buried in Jardines de Oriente cemetery. =Aftermath= The Mexican government deployed more than 1,000 troops to Nezahualc√≥yotl as a response to the assassination of Serrano Cedillo under a military-led program called Operation Neza. This was the first time since the start of Mexico's drug war in 2006 that soldiers have been deployed at this scale near the nation's capital. In Nezahualc√≥yotl, a city with around 1.1 million people and part of the Mexico City's metropolitan area, is home to a turf war between Los Zetas and La Familia Michoacana, two drug trafficking organizations that fight for the growing drug market and illegal goods in the region. The troops were finally relocated from Nezahualc√≥yotl on 3 November 2012 after Operation Neza concluded.

It spanned in a west‚Äìeast direction along the present route of LA 39 between New Orleans and Chalmette. It was essentially a temporary designation for the relocation of LA 39 north (west) of LA 47. Route description From the west, LA 3082 began at a junction with LA 39 and LA 3021 at the intersection of Elysian Fields and North Claiborne Avenues in New Orleans. As North Claiborne narrows to two lanes east of Elysian Fields, LA 3082 proceeded eastward along a transition from North Claiborne Avenue onto parallel North Robertson Street and followed that street to the Claiborne Avenue Bridge, where it rejoined North Claiborne Avenue to cross the Industrial Canal. Westbound traffic followed North Claiborne Avenue throughout. East of the Industrial Canal, LA 3082 continued along North Claiborne Avenue to the Orleans-St. Bernard Parish line where it crossed from New Orleans into Arabi. Here the local name changed to West Goodchildren Street (now West Judge Perez Drive), and LA 3082 continued east into Chalmette to a terminus at LA 47 (Paris Road). LA 3082 was a divided, four-lane highway for its entire length. History LA 3082 was the short-lived designation for the relocation of LA 39 between New Orleans and Chalmette in the mid-1960s. The project called for the improvement and widening of North Claiborne Avenue as a four-lane thoroughfare from Elysian Fields Avenue east to Paris Road in Chalmette. Earlier improvements along the corridor resulted in the construction of two bridges: a two-lane overpass for North Claiborne across the Press Street railroad yard (opened in 1951) and a four-lane vertical lift bridge across the Industrial Canal (the Judge Seeber or Claiborne Avenue Bridge, opened in 1957). The railroad overpass originated as part of a citywide grade separation program approved in 1947 connected with the construction of the Union Passenger Terminal. The Industrial Canal bridge was added to relieve the traffic congestion on nearby St. Claude Avenue and provide an alternate route during times when the bascule bridge on that thoroughfare was in the raised position. In 1961, the state highway department prepared further improvements to the corridor. The railroad overpass on North Robertson Street opened parallel to that on North Claiborne Avenue the following year. This alleviated a traffic bottleneck by allowing the two-lane section of North Claiborne Avenue between Elysian Fields Avenue and the Industrial Canal bridge to carry westbound traffic exclusively with eastbound traffic now following North Robertson Street. Work then focused on extending North Claiborne Avenue from Caffin Avenue on the east side of the Industrial Canal bridge to LA 47 (Paris Road) in Chalmette, completed in September 1967. Upon completion, this became the new route of LA 39, and LA 3082 was decommissioned. The route of LA 46 was then extended to cover the former route of LA 39. From its original western terminus in Poydras, LA 46 now followed St. Bernard Highway to LA 47 (Paris Road) co-signed with LA 39. At this point, LA 39 zigzagged onto the new alignment while LA 46 continued along the old alignment, following St. Claude and Elysian Fields Avenues to North Claiborne Avenue as it does today. Except for a short stretch at Poydras, this concurrency was eliminated once LA 39 was moved onto two further extensions of Judge Perez Drive: from Chalmette to Violet in 1975 and from Violet to Poydras in 1981.

The name \\"Moran\\" reportedly means 'forest dweller'. History It can be stated that the original language of the Morans was a Kachari language, as stated by the researcher W.B. Brown. During the medieval period(13th-16th century), the Morans as well as Chutias after coming in contact and getting partially assimilated by the invading Shans, resorted to speaking the lingua franca, which was a mixture of their native tongue and Prakrit. This process of transition gave rise to the Moran language, which over time was again replaced by a modern form of Assamese which had a greater influence of Prakrit. The Morans now are found mostly in the Tinsukia district. They were greatly migratory due to jhumming or shifting cultivation even during the colonial era. They gradually migrated north from their original habitat near Tipam and Charaideo where the first Tai immigrants met them, probably due to spread of wet-rice cultivation in their original habitat.In the early 13th century, the Moran territories were bounded by Buridhing on the north and Disang on the south When the British arrived in the 19th century, the area between Dibrugarh and Sadiya was mostly virgin forestsSaikia, Yasmin,Fragmented Memories: Struggling to be Tai-Ahom in India,p. 105 and the chief habitat of the Morans.

Knoedler & Co. was an art dealership in New York City founded in 1846. When it closed in 2011, amid lawsuits for fraud, it was one of the oldest commercial art galleries in the US, having been in operation for 165 years. History Knoedler dates its origin to 1846, when French dealers Goupil & Cie opened a branch in New York. Goupil & Cie was an extremely dynamic print-publishing house founded in Paris in 1827. Michel (later Michael) Knoedler (1823-1878), born in Kapf near Gaildorf in Baden- W√ºrttemberg, Germany, started to work for Goupil & Cie in Paris in 1844, and moved to New York in 1852 to take charge of the New York branch. He purchased the U.S. arm of the business in 1857, and was later joined by his sons Roland (1856-1932), Edmond and Charles, with Roland taking the lead after his father's death in 1878. With dealer Charles Carstairs, Knoedler opened branches in Pittsburgh (1897), London (1908) and Paris (1895),Goldstein, 2003, p. 167 and, under Carstairs' influence developed a reputation as a leading dealer of Old Master paintings, with customers including collectors such as Collis P. Huntington, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Henry O. Havemeyer, William Rockefeller, Walter P. Chrysler Jr., John Jacob Astor, Andrew Mellon, J. P. Morgan, and Henry Clay Frick, and institutions such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Louvre, and the Tate Gallery. Knoedler & Co. became part of an elite group of art dealerships, which dominated the market for British painting in America.. Knoedler developed a fruitful relationship with London gallery Colnaghi, with Colnaghi finding suitable paintings in Europe for Knoedler to sell to wealthy collectors in the US. Knoedler and Colnaghi were involved in the secret sales by the Soviet government of works from the Russian Imperial collection in the Hermitage in the 1920s and 1930s, along with Matthiesen in Berlin. After Roland Knoedler retired in 1928, the management of the firm passed to his nephew Charles Henschel, with Carmen Mesmore, Charles Carstairs and his son Carroll Carstairs. Henschel died in 1956, and E. Coe Kerr and Roland Balay (Michael Knoedler's grandson) took over. The firm was sold to industrialist and collector Armand Hammer for $2.5 million in 1971. Five years later, the last member of the Knoedler family - Roland Balay - ceased his involvement in the management of the firm. It increasingly concentrated on contemporary art from the late 1970s. After Hammer's death in 1990, the Hammer foundation continued to hold a controlling interest in the gallery until it closed in 2011, when Michael Armand Hammer (Armand Hammer's grandson) was its chairman. Locations The art dealership occupied eight different locations, starting on Broadway. By the 1890s, it operated from a row house at Fifth Avenue and 34th Street. By 1911, the row house was scheduled to be demolished to make way for the B. Altman and Company Building, so Knoedler moved to a new building at 556 Fifth Avenue, designed by Carr√®re and Hastings. Knoedler then moved to another new building by Carr√®re and Hastings at 14 East 57th Street, near Madison Avenue, in 1925. The firm incurred significant costs in refurbishing new premises in an Italian Renaissance-style town house at 19 East 70th Street in 1970. Knoedler held a 150-year retrospective in 1996, exhibiting works such as John Singleton Copley's Watson and the Shark, Thomas Eakins's Music, and √âdouard Manet's The Plum, with loans from 15 institutions, including the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the National Gallery of Art, a coup for a commercial gallery. In February 2011, the gallery sold its premises at 19 East 70th Street for $31 million. In 2012, the gallery attempted to auction a portion of its remaining inventory of artworks. Alleged connection to Nazi looted art Knoedler was involved in several high profile lawsuits involving Nazi looted art, including a Matisse confiscated by the Nazis in 1941 from the Rosenberg family which Knoedler acquired in 1954 and which was eventually donated to the Seattle Art Museum in 1996 by Virginia and Prentice Bloedel, and an El Greco seized by the Gestapo in 1944. The El Greco painting, Portrait of a Gentleman, was listed in exhibition catalogues as being in the collection of New York‚Äôs Knoedler & Co, who bought the painting from the Viennese dealer Frederick Mont, a dealer who worked with the Gestapo, according to Anne Webber, co-chair of the Commission for Looted Art in Europe. Both paintings were restituted after lawsuits were filed. Art fraud scandal and closure The gallery's president Ann Freedman resigned in October 2009, amid rumours of problems with fakes involving paintings supplied to the gallery by Long Island art dealer Glafira Rosales. It was later discovered that between 1994 and 2011, under Freedman's direction, the gallery had sold faked paintings of works by Robert Motherwell, Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko, among others. Freedman had purchased the paintings for Knoedler from Glafira Rosales, who had in turn obtained the fake paintings from the art forger Pei-Shen Qian (). Qian had reportedly painted the forgeries in a garage in Queens, New York. Qian was able to imitate the styles of the masters, and give the paintings an illusion of age by using tea or dirt from a vacuum cleaner, dirtying their appearance. He is reported to have received less than $9,000 USD for each painting from Rosales, while Rosales sold the paintings for millions of dollars each to Knoedler. A statement issued on Wednesday 28 November 2011 by Knoedler stated simply that it was closing permanently for business reasons unrelated to the lawsuits it faced over the sale of forged paintings. By 2012, the FBI was investigating \\"at least two dozen paintings\\" that were supplied to the gallery by Glafira Rosales. While Rosales initially claimed not to have defrauded anyone, in 2013, she pleaded guilty to selling over 60 fake works of art to two New York art galleries, conspiracy to commit money laundering, money laundering and tax evasion, and wire fraud. She served three months in jail. In 2017, Rosales was ordered to pay $81 million to the victims of the Knoedler art-fraud scheme. Spanish art dealer Jose Carlos Berganti√±os Diaz (Ms. Rosales' boyfriend) and his brother Jesus Angel Berganti√±os Diaz were also indicted in US District Court for the fraud. The Diaz brothers were arrested in Spain, and released on bail, in 2014. In 2016, a Spanish court ruled that Jesus Angel Bergantinos Diaz could be extradited to the United States. Later that year, a Spanish court ruled that Jesus' brother, Jos√© Carlos Bergantinos Diaz, could not be extradited to the United States due to health reasons. The art forger who painted the fakes, Pei-Shen Qian, was indicted but avoided prosecution by fleeing to China. In 2020, filmmaker Barry Avrich directed and produced, Made You Look: A True Story About Fake Art, a documentary on the Knoedler scandal. Made You Look: A True Story About Fake Art Daria Price's feature documentary about the scandal and trial, Driven to Abstraction, premiered in London in 2019. Lawsuits and claims related to sales In 2003, Goldman Sachs executive Jack Levy had bought an untitled Jackson Pollock painting for $2 million, but when the International Foundation for Art Research declined to authenticate the work, Levy asked for and received his money back. The day before the gallery closed in November 2011, Belgian hedge-fund manager Pierre Lagrange sued the gallery in relation to the work Untitled 1950, which Knoedler attributed to Jackson Pollock. Lagrange had purchased the painting for $17 million in 2007, on the understanding that it would be included in a supplement to the Pollock catalogue raisonn√©. It was later claimed that no such supplement was planned; tests later showed that some of the paint used was not available until some years after Pollock's death. The suit was settled out of court in 2012. In 2012, Domenico De Sole and his wife Eleanore claimed that the gallery sold them a fake Mark Rothko, \\"Untitled 1956\\", for $8.3 million in 2004. The lawsuit, with Knoedler and Ann Freedman as defendants, went to trial in January 2016. The Soles settled out of court with Ann Freedman on February 7, 2015, but continued their suit against Knoedler. Wall Street executive John D. Howard sued Knoedler and its former director Ann Freedman in 2012, claiming that a Willem de Kooning painting that he bought for $4 million in 2007 was a fake. The suit was settled out of court in December 2015. Archive In 2012, the Getty Research Institute announced that it had purchased the majority of the gallery's archives, dating from 1850 to 1971. The Getty subsequently digitized parts of the archive and made them available online. With the exception of the reference library, which the Knoedler Gallery sold separately in January 2012, and which consists of titles already in the Getty Research Institute's library, this acquisition represents the complete archive of the gallery's operations from the 1850s to 1971, when it was acquired by Armand Hammer. The archival material includes business records; correspondence among clients, artists, and Knoedler staff; card files on clients and artworks; photographs; prints; rare books; sales catalogs dating to the 18th century; and gallery installation plans.

This species appears to be endemic to very high altitudes. This species belong to the Galba/Fossaria group, therefore this species should be named Galba meridensis. cf.Bargues M.

Distribution  Kettle Mucubaj√≠ is the type locality. According to the 2011 knowledge of the distribution of this species, and in contrast to the widespread species Galba cousini, Lymnaea meridensis appears to be a geographically restricted species. This seems to suggest that Lymnaea meridensis evolved in a somewhat isolated fashion, in permanent ponds and small ditches in more northern, very high altitude areas (3,550-4,040 m) of the Andean mountains, like those in Merida State, Venezuela. The type locality of Lymnaea meridensis is a permanent pond in Mucubaji (Kettle Mucubaj√≠), Merida State, Venezuela, located at an altitude of 3,550 m (8¬∞47'51.8\\" N, 70¬∞49'32.4\\" W). Photo of an abapertural view of a shell of Lymnaea meridensis.  Description  The shell is light brown, thin- walled, with a relatively short spire. The apex is obtuse. The shell has fine growth lines, and has only 3 whorls. The body whorl dominates the shell, is inflated and separated by a deep, well-marked suture. The aperture is large, oblique, oval and wide at the base. The shell tends to be one and a half times as long as it is wide, and its aperture tends to be two thirds as long as the shell or more than twice as long as the spire. The width of the shell is 3.7-6.0 mm. The height of the shell is 6.6-9.3 mm. The width of the aperture is 2.5-3.9 mm. The height of the aperture is 4.8-6.0 mm. Excretory system: renal tube and ureter Excretory system: The renal tube extends straightly from the pericardial region toward the mantle collar, diagonally across the roof of the pallial cavity. In its distal part, behind the osphradium, it shows two distinct flexures, coming back upon itself and, after a short course, bending sharply cephalad and rightward forming a ureter which tapers to a subterminal meatus behind the pneumostome. Reproductive system: The ovotestis appears composed by pressed acini around a collecting canal which continues into an ovispermiduct presenting a very short smooth-walled proximal segment followed by a bosselated swelling seminal vesicle and finally a relatively short distal segment which ends in the carrefour. The albumen gland covers the carrefour and the origin of a bosselated, transverse tubular oviduct which follows a somewhat convolute course continuing into a striated nidamental gland. The nidamental gland narrows into a smooth-walled uterus, which bends and continues into a short bulbous vagina showing a sphincter-like thickening. The spherical spermatheca gives rise to a uniformly thin spermathecal duct which extends diagonally between the nidamental gland and the prostate until joining the vagina. The distal portion of the spermiduct and the proximal portion of the prostate run on the ventral surface of the nidamental gland. The spermiduct, of granular outer surface, emerges from the carrefour, runs distalward and finally narrows to merge into a similarly granular prostate. The prostate increases in width to its distal end, shows ventrally a lengthwise fissure, formed by the folding of its left margin, and finally two rounded protuberances, from whose convergence the vas deferens arises. The vas deferens appears as a long, more or less uniformly thin duct which merges into a penis which is included within the penial sheath. The penis sheath is regularly cylindrical, with a somewhat thicker proximal part. The penis sheath is a little longer than the prepuce (ratio range of 0.93-1.38; mean 1.18 ¬± 0.18). The prepuce is thicker, around twice as wide as the penis sheath at the point of insertion of the penial sheath and gradually narrowing to terminate in the male genital pore. { Reproductive system of Lymnaea meridensis Other parts of the reproductive system. }  Ecology  Lymnaea meridensis is probably susceptible to Fasciola hepatica infection.

They settled in the cities of Braddock, Homestead, Johnstown, and Uniontown, Pennsylvania; Cleveland and Youngstown, Ohio; Detroit and Delray, Michigan; Gary, Indiana; Chicago, Illinois; and New York City. The Hungarian Slovak Gypsies were a community of settled Roma, and in the United States were well known for playing music for the Central European immigrant communities in which they settled. These Roma were known for playing in cafes and restaurants, the name associating these Romani as Bashald√© was made up in late 20th century, and in Hungary they are called Romungro Romani; portions of them were also known as Romungre. In the early 1900s the Roma in Braddock, Pennsylvania, purchased an entire block of homes, making them the largest population of settled Roma in the United States. John Brenkacs Hungarian Gypsy Orchestra c. 1925, with Albert Balog, Geza Duna bass, Louis Balog cimbalom, Rudy Rigo Violin The Hungarian Gypsy Orchestra consist of a lead violin referred to as a Primas, a second violin or viola, tenor violin, bass fiddle and a cimbalom. Their music was an important part of world roots music, and they performed throughout America in Hungarian music and all genres of music. In 1887, the first of these Roma immigrated to America, they brought to America the traditional Hungarian Gypsy music they and their ancestors played in Europe for hundreds of years. These Gypsy musicians were descendants of famous Gypsy orchestras such as J√°nos Bihari, whose descendants today are the Lakatos family; female Gypsy violinist Czinka Panna; Pista Dank√≥; Rig√≥ Jancsi; Imre Magyari; and Racz Laci. They created the Cs√°rd√°s, which influenced such composers as Joseph Haydn; Franz Liszt, who wrote fifteen Hungarian rhapsodies; Johannes Brahms, who wrote twenty-one Hungarian dances; Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k; Pablo de Sarasate, who wrote Zigeunerweisen; Georges Bizet, who wrote Carmen; and Maurice Ravel, who wrote Tzigane.

Cleveland Hungarians held hundreds of events every year and the Gypsies were the entertainment for all of these events.. Available through the Cleveland Memory Project, Cleveland State University Libraries. Detroit's Delray district had many Hungarian restaurants such as the Hungarian Village, where as many as four cimbaloms would be set up to play, and in Braddock, Pennsylvania, journalists from all over the world were writing about them. These Hungarian Gypsy musicians played all the major Hungarian events, and many American events for over 100 years, and in the finest restaurants in the country. They also played many weddings and special occasions, including movies. For over 100 years, newspaper articles, books, and journals documented them and their traditions. One tradition is the Hungarian Gypsy funeral were as many as fifty to seventy-five musicians would play for the deceased in a funeral procession. Many of the funerals news reporters covered went through the Associated Press in newspapers all over the world. The best known Primas' (lead violin) came from this group such as Joska Rabb, Ernie Kiraly, Max Bandy, Kal Bandy, Maxie Rigo, Martze Ballog, William Garber, John Brenkacs, Louis Ballog, Albert Balog, Geza Duna, Rudy Rigo, Emery Deutsch, Frank Richko, Maxie Fransko,Rudy Balog, Rudy Ziga, Arthur Rakoczi, Gusty Horvath, Alex Udvary, George Batyi, Tony Ballog, Billy Rose, Martze Ballog, Willie Horvath, Bill Yedla, Albert Duna, Albert Horvath, and Bella (Bendy) Ballog. The Gypsy Countess Verona, was one of the most famous of these Hungarian Slovak Gypsies. She married the Count Dean Szechy de Szechy Favla, of Budapest. She was one of the greatest cimbalom players in the world; she toured the world, made records and wrote music. In 1924, Henry Ford, in an effort to get the young people away from jazz and back into the old music, started his Old Fashion Dance Band. Musicians from all over the world auditioned for a spot in the band. The cimbalom player was a Hungarian Gypsy from Braddock, William Hallup. They made records, traveled the world and played at all Ford's events. His cimbalom is in the Henry Ford Museum.

His defense was managed by cannabis magazine THC. He spent the next fifteen days after the arrest in preventive prison under the charge of cultivating cannabis. Representative Victoria Donda said the detention was unjust and that the State should not prosecute self-sufficient consumers.

Pioneered by Roger Angel at the Steward Observatory's mirror lab, this makes large () thin parabolic mirrors by spinning the oven as the glass is melted and cooled. The term is applied to the fabrication of large telescope mirrors, where the natural paraboloid curve followed by the molten glass greatly reduces the amount of grinding required. Rather than being cast by pouring glass into a mold (with top and bottom), an entire turntable containing the peripheral mold, and the back pattern (a honeycomb pattern to lighten the finished product) is contained within a furnace and charged with the glass material used. The assembly (or rotating furnace) is then heated while spun at slow speed until the glass is liquid, then gradually cooled over a period of months.

Known for his surrealist films, he has developed his own unique cinematic style; known as \\"Lynchian\\", this style is noted most often for its dreamlike imagery and meticulous sound design. The surreal and, in many cases, violent elements in his films have earned them a reputation as works that \\"disturb, offend or mystify\\" general audiences. Although born in Missoula, Montana, Lynch spent his youth traveling across the United States due to his father Donald's job for the Department of Agriculture; as a result, Lynch attended school across several states. Raised in a contented, happy family, the young Lynch was a member of the Boy Scouts of America, reaching the highest rank of Eagle Scout. However, Lynch took to building fireworks and playing the bongos in a Beat Generation nightclub as acts of rebellion, before discovering that he could translate his childhood fascination with drawing and painting into a career in fine art. Lynch and his close friend Jack Fisk travelled to Austria hoping to study under Oskar Kokoschka, but the artist was not present at the time. Returning to the United States, Lynch enrolled in the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia. Although initially focusing on oil painting and sculpture, Lynch found himself beginning to experiment with short films. After completing several short animated and partly animated works, Lynch was prompted by his mentor Bushnell Keeler to apply for one of four annual grants from the American Film Institute to fund another film project. The resulting film, The Grandmother, paved the way for Lynch's scholarship at the AFI Conservatory; while studying there, Lynch wrote and directed a film which would take several years to gestate‚Äîhis feature-length d√©but and the beginning of his commercial film career, Eraserhead. Early life Lynch was born on January 20, 1946 in Missoula, Montana to Donald and Edwina \\"Sunny\\" (n√©e Sundholm) Lynch, who met as students at Duke University. David was the eldest of three siblings. For the most part a housewife, Sunny also tutored English lessons, having earned her degree at Duke. Donald Lynch worked for the United States Department of Agriculture, which necessitated moving the family around the country‚Äîthey relocated to Sandpoint, Idaho, when David was two months old. Before his fourteenth birthday the family had lived in Spokane, Washington; Durham, North Carolina; Boise, Idaho; and Alexandria, Virginia. The young Lynch easily coped with this transitory lifestyle, and was popular throughout his school years, having found it easy for an \\"outsider\\" such as himself to make friends after moving to a new school. Lynch's elementary and junior high school educations were taken in Boise; he attended high school in Alexandria. Lynch recalls having a happy childhood, although he suffered from bouts of agoraphobia in his youth, especially after having been scared by a screening of Henry King's 1952 film Wait till the Sun Shines, Nellie, when he was six years old. He would develop a brief habit of wearing three neckties at a time, which he understands to have been a manifestation of his personal insecurity. He also points to a particular image from his childhood that shaped his understanding of the world‚Äî\\"[my youth] was a dream world, those droning airplanes, blue skies, picket fences, green grass, cherry trees. Middle America as it was supposed to be. But then on the cherry tree would be this pitch oozing out, some of it black, some of it yellow, and there were millions and millions of red ants racing all over the sticky pitch, all over the tree. So you see, there's this beautiful world and you just look a little bit closer and it's all red ants\\". Finding the calm and contented nature of his home life frustrating, the young Lynch sought ways to secretly rebel against his parents. He and a friend took to building bottle rockets; after a particularly powerful rocket severely damaged his friend's foot they switched their focus to making and detonating pipe bombs for fun instead. A large pipe bomb which they detonated in a school swimming pool was heard by several neighbors, and resulted in Lynch and his friend being arrested. Lynch was also a member of the high school fraternity Alpha Omega Upsilon, and learned to play the bongos while frequenting a nightclub popular with the Beat Generation, earning the nickname \\"Bongo Dave\\". Lynch was a member of the Boy Scouts of America, attaining the rank of Eagle Scout. His childhood friend Toby Keeler posited that this experience and the \\"be prepared\\" Scout motto formed the basis of Lynch's \\"do it yourself\\" approach to filmmaking and art, and shaped his ability to \\"make things out of nothing\\". Lynch had initially joined the Scouts in order to \\"put it behind\\" him, but continued at the urging of his father; he eventually summed up his biography as \\"Eagle Scout. Missoula, Montana\\" in a 1990 press release for Wild at Heart. As a Boy Scout, Lynch was present at John F. Kennedy's presidential inauguration, which took place on Lynch's 15th birthday. When Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, Lynch was the first in his school to hear of it, as he was working on a display case rather than attending class. Art student Lynch travelled to Austria to study art under Oskar Kokoschka (pictured 1963), but was unable to meet the artist. Lynch's interest in art began at an early age; he recalled his father bringing home large amounts of paper from his government job, and because his mother would not let him use coloring books, he would draw and paint on this spare paper. Lynch's early artwork mostly depicted war-related imagery‚Äîweaponry and fighter planes‚Äîbased on his collection of toy military equipment. He frequently depicted the M1917 Browning machine gun, calling it a favorite of his. Later in life, however, Lynch was summoned for conscription for the Vietnam War, and declared 4-F, \\"unfit for military service\\", for undisclosed health reasons. At the age of 14, Lynch's family visited Hungry Horse, Montana, staying with his aunt and uncle near Hungry Horse Dam. Their next-door neighbor was an artist named Ace Powell, whose style was similar to that of Charlie Russell and Frederic Remington. Powell and his wife were both painters, and would let Lynch work with their materials while he was staying in town; however, Lynch found it difficult to believe that art was something in which he could forge a career, believing it to be a hobby peculiar to the Western United States. Returning home to Virginia, Lynch met Keeler's father Bushnell, who was also an artist. Lynch rented space in the elder Keeler's studio and, alongside his friend Jack Fisk, worked on his art until he had finished school. From there, he enrolled in the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, but soon dropped out. Bushnell Keeler has commented that Lynch's dropping out of the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston \\"worked to his detriment then, but may now be one of his greatest assets\\". Keeler recounts that Lynch left the school after allowing one of his tutors to use his dormitory room; the tutor, who was in the process of divorcing his wife, spent several nights in Lynch's room with his mistress, while Lynch obligingly slept on the floor. Rather than confronting the tutor about this situation, Lynch felt it would be easier to leave school instead. Keeler and film critic Greg Olson posit that this desire to avoid confrontation has shaped the characters he has written, who often seek an \\"escape route\\" in the face of adversity rather than face it directly. Olson has further added that several of Lynch's later works‚ÄîDune and Twin Peaks‚Äîwould have \\"been less compromised\\" had Lynch been of a more adversarial personality; as they were, both projects featured interference from film and television studios respectively. After this, Lynch and Fisk planned a three- year trip to Austria, planning to study under the expressionist painter Oskar Kokoschka, who was one of Lynch's \\"least favorite painters\\". However, when Lynch arrived in Salzburg, he found that the artist had left, prompting him to return to America. Before leaving Europe, the pair travelled to Athens by train, to visit Lynch's girlfriend at the time, who was holidaying there. However, when they arrived in Greece they discovered that she had already left for home; Lynch and Fisk departed for America shortly thereafter. Upon his return, Lynch enrolled in the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, devoting himself to painting and sculpture. Lynch's paintings, which were influenced by the works of Francis Bacon, were executed in oils, and following an incident in which a moth landed in a still-drying piece, he began embedding insects in his work. Life in Philadelphia was disturbing for Lynch, who had by this point married his pregnant girlfriend Peggy Reavey. The two had met in 1964, and wed in 1967, shortly before the birth of their daughter Jennifer. Lynch and his family spent five years living in an atmosphere of \\"violence, hate and filth\\". The area was rife with crime, which would later inform the tone of his work. Describing this period of his life, Lynch said \\"I saw so many things in Philadelphia I couldn't believe ... I saw a grown woman grab her breasts and speak like a baby, complaining her nipples hurt. This kind of thing will set you back\\". In Olson's David Lynch: Beautiful Dark, the author posits that this time contrasted starkly with the director's childhood in the Pacific Northwest, giving the director a \\"bipolar, Heaven- and-Hell vision of America\\" which has subsequently shaped his films. Short films Lynch lived for several years in Philadelphia while studying fine art. Lynch's experiments with moving sculptures led to his interest in the medium of motion picture film. In 1966, with the help of Fisk, Lynch animated a one- minute short feature called Six Figures Getting Sick; the project cost $200 and was filmed with a sixteen millimeter camera. The sculpture-motion picture was a simple animated loop of several figures growing increasingly nauseous before vomiting down the screen. This loop was repeated several times and accompanied by the sound of an air-raid siren; however, it was projected onto a cast of Lynch's head in order to distort the footage further. After Six Figures Getting Sick was completed, one of Lynch's classmates, H. Barton Wasserman, offered to pay $1000 for a similar motion picture to be made for an art installation in his home. Lynch purchased a clockwork Bolex movie camera, and began to teach himself cinematography. Lynch worked on the commissioned motion picture over the next two months, crafting a mix of live action and animation in a split-screen format. However, when the film was developed, an error along the way had rendered it indistinguishable and unusable. Wasserman allowed Lynch to keep the remainder of the budget, which he used to fund the production of a new motion picture project, The Alphabet. Similarly to Wasserman's unfinished commission, 1968's The Alphabet was composed of both live action and animation. The abstract 16mm movie was inspired by an experience related by Lynch's wife Peggy, who had once seen her niece reciting the alphabet in her sleep while suffering from a nightmare. Peggy was the sole live action actor in the film, which depicted in animation the nightmares of a young girl. The film displays several elements that would continue throughout Lynch's oeuvre, including the use of meticulous sound design to convey unease. The sound of his infant daughter crying was recorded on a faulty cassette recorder and included in the film's soundtrack; the malfunctioning of the recorder not only lent the sound a desirably distorted quality but allowed Lynch to return it to where he had purchased it from upon finishing the film. Although Lynch was enthusiastic about the medium of film, he realized that the wages from his job as a printer would not stretch to cover future budgetary needs. Bushnell Keeler recommended that Lynch apply for a grant from the newly formed American Film Institute (AFI). Together with a copy of The Alphabet, Lynch's application included an eight-page treatment for a project titled The Grandmother. The submission was successful, and Lynch was awarded one of four annual grants from the AFI, totalling $5,000. The Grandmother was filmed in Lynch's home in Philadelphia and starred his friends and colleagues. Lynch's initial grant of $5,000 was later supplemented by a further $2,200 also supplied by the AFI. Completed in 1970, it relates the story of a family grown from the ground like plants; the neglected and abused son seeks to create stability in his life by growing a grandmother from a seed. Once again, the film mixes animation with live action footage, and features the use of both pallid stage make-up reminiscent of the silent film era, and a similarly washed-out use of colour to The Alphabet. Running for thirty minutes, the film has been described by critics Colin Odell and Michelle Le Blanc as \\"fall[ing] into that twilight category of film that is too short to be a feature and too long to be a short film\\". AFI Conservatory Having completed The Grandmother, Lynch realized that filmmaking was the career he wanted to pursue. He accepted a scholarship at the AFI Conservatory, Lynch moved to Los Angeles, California, with his family, and recalls having felt \\"the evaporation of fear\\" after leaving the crime and poverty of Philadelphia. Lynch was dissatisfied with the Conservatory and considered dropping out, but he changed his mind after being offered the chance to produce a script of his own devising. He was given permission to use the school's full campus for film sets; he converted the school's disused stables into a series of sets and lived there. He began work on a script titled Gardenback, based on his painting of a hunched figure with vegetation growing from its back. Gardenback was a surrealist script about adultery, featuring a continually growing insect that represented one man's lust for his neighbor. The script would have resulted in a roughly 45-minute-long film, which the AFI felt was too long for such a figurative, nonlinear script. In its place, Lynch presented Eraserhead, which he had developed based on a daydream of a man's head being taken to a pencil factory by a small boy. Several board members at the AFI were still opposed to producing such a surrealist work, but they were persuaded when dean Frank Daniel threatened to resign if it was vetoed. Eraserhead script is thought to have been inspired by Lynch's fear of fatherhood; Jennifer had been born with \\"severely clubbed feet\\", requiring extensive corrective surgery as a child. Jennifer has claimed that her own unexpected conception and birth defects were the basis for the film's themes. Pre-production work for Eraserhead began in 1971. However, the staff at the AFI had underestimated the project's scale‚Äîthey had initially green-lit Eraserhead after viewing a twenty-one page screenplay, assuming that the film industry's usual ratio of one minute of film per scripted page would reduce the film to approximately twenty minutes. This misunderstanding, coupled with Lynch's own meticulous direction, caused the film to remain in production for a number of years. In an extreme example of this labored schedule, one scene in the film begins with Jack Nance's character opening a door‚Äîa full year would pass before he was filmed entering the room. Buoyed with regular donations from Fisk and his wife Sissy Spacek, production continued for several years. Additional funds were provided by Nance and his wife, actress Catherine Coulson, who worked as a waitress and donated her income, and by Lynch himself, who delivered newspapers throughout the film's principal photography. During one of the many lulls in filming, Lynch was able to produce the short film The Amputee, taking advantage of the AFI's wish to test new film stock before committing to bulk purchases. The short piece starred Coulson, who continued working with Lynch as a technician on Eraserhead. Eraserhead production crew was very small, composed of Lynch; sound designer Alan Splet; cinematographer Herb Cardwell, who left during production and was replaced with Frederick Elmes; production manager and prop technician Doreen Small; and Coulson, who worked in a variety of roles. Lynch began his interest in Transcendental Meditation during the film's production, adopting a vegetarian diet and giving up smoking and alcohol consumption. After Eraserhead Eraserhead premi√®red at the Filmex film festival in Los Angeles, on March 19, 1977. On its opening night, the film was attended by 25 people. The second evening had 24 viewers. Ben Barenholtz, head of distributor Libra Films International, persuaded local theater Cinema Village to run the film as a midnight feature, where it continued for a year. After this, it ran for ninety-nine weeks at New York's Waverly Cinema, had a year-long midnight run at San Francisco's Roxie Theater from 1978 to 1979, and achieved a three-year tenure at Los Angeles' Nuart Theatre between 1978 and 1981. The film has grossed $7,000,000 in the United States . Following the release of Eraserhead, Lynch tried to find funding for his next project, Ronnie Rocket, a film \\"about electricity and a three-foot guy with red hair\\". Lynch met film producer Stuart Cornfeld during this time. Cornfeld had enjoyed Eraserhead and was interested in producing Ronnie Rocket; he worked for Mel Brooks and Brooksfilms at the time, and when the two realized that Ronnie Rocket was unlikely to find sufficient financing, Lynch asked to see some already-written scripts to work from for his next film. Cornfeld found four scripts he felt might interest Lynch, but on hearing the name of the first, Lynch decided his next project would be The Elephant Man.

The two photojournalists worked in an area that is known for narcotics trafficking and could have been targeted because of their employment as freelance journalists who sometimes photographed accident scenes for the local newspaper.  Career  Barajas, 46, and Lopez, 26, were both freelance photographers who were often seen offering their services in the plaza in the town of Zamora and also to the Zamora Valley Press Association. Barajas had also photographed accident scenes and drug-related crimes for the Diaro de Zamora newspaper. They were not, however, members of the press organization.  Deaths  The two photographers were last seen on 16 August 2012 while on their way to photograph a social event. Their families said they had left home around 21:00 to work. Their bodies were found in the trunk of an abandoned car on Sunday, 19 August 2012 in the rural area of Tinaja de Vargas, outside the city of Ecuandureo. This city is about 90 miles from the town of Morelia, the capital of Michoac√°n. Their bodies showed signs of torture and they were killed by gunshot wounds around the head. Related crimes The murders are believed to have been carried out by members of Knights Templar Cartel (Los Caballeros Templarios Cartel), which since 2011 has controlled drug trafficking in the state of Michoac√°n. Fifteen other people died in drug-related violence during the same weekend in Michoac√°n. No progress has been made in the investigation.  Impact  According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, there have been 27,199 homicides recorded in Mexico during 2011, making it the deadliest year since President Felipe Calderon was elected in 2006. During Calderon's presidency, Article 19 said there have been 72 journalists murdered, 13 journalists reported missing, and 40 assaults on journalists.  Reactions  The Mexican federal government sent 1,000 additional troops to Michoac√°n to give extra support to local police forces in their fight against the drug cartels operating in that area.

He emigrated to Australia, arriving in Hobart in 1831 and moving to Sydney in 1838 on the Saint George with his brothers William and Duncan, Duncan's wife Ann and their three children. He and brother William settled on a property they called Struan Station in Victoria on the River Wannon in the vicinity of modern Coleraine and Merino. It was around then he acquired the nickname \\"Poorman Robertson\\", perhaps from his appearance which contrasted sharply with that of Henty, a rival landholder in Portland, Victoria. In 1852 their elder brother Angus joined them and took over management of Struan. William settled on another of their properties Wando Vale, and John moved to Mosquito Creek near Naracoorte, on an area variously known as Mosquito Plains and Robertsons Plains, where he built a succession of three homes, culminating in the magnificent Struan House in 1875. He purchased further land at Wrattonbully and Elderslie, totalling over 500,000 ha. Struan House and some 500ha of its original property is now owned by South Australian Department of Agriculture as its regional headquarters.

In 2008, the United States Department of State released a report on human trafficking in Canada that was generally critical of the Government of Canada for failing to address the issue, but the report praised the efforts of the Executive Council of British Columbia, specifically citing their creation of OCTIP. In June 2011, OCTIP launched a training program to certify first responders to identify, protect, and assist victims of human trafficking in the province. The program cost $106000; half of the funding came from OCTIP while the rest was covered by Public Safety Canada and the Department of Justice. The following month, the Executive Council of British Columbia cut the annual budget for OCTIP from $500000 down to $300000, got rid of the executive director position, and reduced the number of full-time staff to two.

It was designed by architect Alfred Giles and designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark. The main house was donated to the San Antonio Conservation Society in 1952. The organization completely restored the main house as a museum and now conducts daily tours. The complete homestead property consists of four individual structures: the main house museum, the carriage house, the river house, and the servants' quarters. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Bexar County, Texas, as a contributing structure of the King William Historic District. Homestead property Alfred Giles, as an employ of John H. Kampmann, is credited with designing the main house. Locally quarried limestone was used in construction of the four-bedroom house. It was completed in 1877 for $15,000. In 1970, the house was listed as a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark. The house features a mansard roof and 13-inch-thick exterior walls. It was fairly modern for its time, with a telephone line, electric lighting and running water. The parlor doors in the house featured American-made etched glass panels. The main house at the homestead was deeded to the San Antonio Conservation Society (SACS) in 1952 by the granddaughter of Edward Steves, Edna Steves Vaughan, and her husband Curtis Vaughan. SACS maintains the home as a museum and conducts daily tours. When SACS first approached Vaughan about purchasing the house, Vaughan offered to donate the house with the stipulation that the then-current residents be retained as caretakers. The grounds, exterior and interior of the French Second Empire style house were restored in 1954 as a museum with period furniture. With much of the original furniture gone, the Steves family donated many of their own pieces for the restoration. Among the pieces added in the restoration was a mosaic table featuring St. Peter's Square in Vatican City. When SACS did the restoration, Yale University donated an antique 1857 Chickering and Sons grand piano. The property contains three buildings in addition to the main house. The carriage house predated the main house and all other structures on the property. Built in 1875, the frame and stone carriage house was restored in 1976‚Äì77. The servants quarters was erected in 1877 and restored in 1983‚Äì84. The one-story brick structure known as the river house once contained San Antonio's first natatorium. When SACS restored the homestead's properties, they covered the river house pool with flooring and began using the structure for their activities. Edward Steves Edward Steves (1829‚Äì90) was a San Antonio city alderman who had relocated to Texas from his native Germany. He and his wife Johanna maintained a family home on rural acreage in Kendall County. He ran the successful Steves Lumber Company in San Antonio from 1866 to 1877. Steves was a civic leader in the San Antonio business community, serving on the Board of Trade, the Volunteer Fire Company No. 2 and the Fair Association. He was active in the city's German community organizations, such as the Schuetzen Verein, the Turnverein and the Casino Club. A Family Business Since 1866 when Edward Steves founded this company, the Steves family has always been involved. Today, five generations later, Steves & Sons continues with Edward Steves commitment to quality, craftsmanship and style. Edward Steves founded his company on the principles of conserving resources and environmental responsibility, while providing quality goods and service.

The village includes more than 40 houses and a mosque adjacent to the river. Nearby forts protected them from raids. Label The village was named by the name of the water that flows from the nearby mountains without interruption and is poured in several places and each mouth has a certain name. [1] There is a local legend that a man lost his stick in one of the valleys, and to retrieve them may follow them until he arrived in the village and gathered its people and extracted the stick after the excavation of the eye. Climate change The climate of the village is hot in summer and mild in winter because it is part of the Tihama area and rises from the sea surface by about 1985 meters, and the rain is heavy in summer and medium in winter. Description This village is famous for agricultural crops such as bananas, Kadi, basil, lemon and palm trees, stores, and scenic river.

Short History The village was established in the tenth century AH, and witnessed many invasions between the tribes before the unification of the Kingdom by King Abdul Aziz Al Saud. One of the most important invasions against the region was when they met the armies of Zahran and Gamad tribes on the one hand with the army of Muhammad Ali Pasha. Ali Pasha and known tombs as \\"graves of the Turks\\". Rehabilitation of the village The Saudi Tourism Authority allocated 16 million riyals for the project of rehabilitating the village, which aims to restore and develop the village and turn it into a tourist site. The project was divided into three phases over a period of five years. The first phase included the rehabilitation of the main corridor of the village and the establishment of sessions along the corridor to the waterfall and the reopening of the mosque and rehabilitation of a number of buildings to make it a museum in addition to the establishment of a visitor center and restaurant and public toilets.

It is located at 3201 Dan Street, in Veterans Park, in Hamtramck, Michigan. The stadium was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. The stadium is located near, and occasionally confused with, Keyworth Stadium (for example, see Black Baseball in Detroit, p. 59). Background John A. Roesink moved to Detroit in 1900 and established a successful clothing store. Roesnick was an avid baseball fan, and sponsored a number of semi-pro teams. In 1910, he built a substantial field, Mack Park, on the corner of Mack and Fairview in Detroit to house his teams. Mack Park had seating for perhaps 6,000 people. In 1919, Rube Foster organized a number of baseball teams featuring black players in northern cities. The Detroit franchise, the Detroit Stars, was owned by Tenny Blount. The team rented Roesink's Mack Park for their games. The 1919 games were a success, so in 1920, Foster organized the Negro National League with nine teams, including the Stars. Initially, the league prospered, and in 1925 Roesink purchased the Stars. The Stars continued to play at Mack Park. However, in July 1929, the grandstand caught fire when the grounds crew attempted to dry the field. A substantial portion of the structure was destroyed. The Stars played the rest of the season at Mack Park, but the grandstand was not rebuilt. Hamtramck Stadium and Negro league baseball In the fall of 1929, Roesink began construction on a baseball park in Hamtramck to replace Mack Park. He leased land near the Grand Trunk Railroad tracks from the Detroit Lumber Company. The land was, at the time, an older portion of the Detroit Lumber Company's yard. Roesink spent an estimated $100,000 of his own money to construct the field and grandstands. The park opened in May 1930 for the start of the 1930 season; Roesink hired Ty Cobb to throw out the first pitch. This was, however, the beginning of the Great Depression. Black fans, angry at Roesnick for the 1929 fire, boycotted the Stars, and Roesnick sold the team after the 1930 season to black racketeer Everitt Watson (although he retained ownership of the stadium). Hard times extended to the rest of the league, and in 1931, the Negro National League completed only half their season before folding. In 1932, a new Negro league, the East-West League, was founded with the Detroit Wolves as the Detroit franchise. The Wolves played their home games in Hamtramck Stadium; however, the league and the Wolves quickly went bust. The Detroit Stars were reconstituted in 1933, also playing at Hamtramck Stadium, but lasted just one season. In the same year, John Roesnick had tax problems and lost control of Hamtramck Stadium. The fate of the park became an issue in 1935 when Gus Greenlee wanted to move the Nashville Elite Giants to Detroit; with no park available, the franchise wound up in Columbus, Ohio instead. Still, there was one more Negro League season at Hamtramck Stadium in 1937, when the Detroit Stars were again reconstituted. As before, the club folded after a single year. Other uses and post-1940 history As with most fields of the era, Hamtramck Stadium was available for rental for other sporting events or activities. The site hosted a number of high school baseball and football games, as well as, in 1934, a football game between Wilberforce University and West Virginia State University, two Historically black colleges and universities. In the mid-1930s, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) constructed Keyworth Stadium near Hamtramck Stadium. In 1938 (and again in 1946) former lumber company acreage near the stadium was purchased and developed into baseball and softball diamonds, making the area into a recreational campus known as Recreational Park (now Veterans Park). In 1940, the stadium was acquired by the city of Hamtramck. In 1941, the WPA, in partnership with the Wayne County Road Commission and the city of Hamtramck, renovated Veterans Park, including the Hamtramck Stadium. The project was jointly sponsored by the and the City. The total cost of the project was $200,000. It is uncertain what the 1941 renovation entailed, but it is certain that at least the steel frame of the grandstand is original. After this renovation, the stadium was used by church leagues and leagues associated with the nearby Dodge Main plant. Hamtramck High School and teams from both St. Ladislaus High School and St. Florian High School also regularly used the field. Starting in 1953, the field was used by Hamtramck's Little League Baseball teams. Over the years, eleven Hamtramck teams in the various Little League divisions went to their division's World Series, with two winning the title. In 1955, concession and maintenance buildings were constructed along the field's third base line. In 1973, the grandstand was again renovated, where the roof, seating, and ramps of the grandstand were rebuilt. This renovation reduced the grandstand to approximately half of its original size. Additional renovations carried out in 1976 eliminated portions of the arms extending on each side of the grandstand. However, as Dodge Main and the Catholic High Schools were closed, the usage of Hamtramck Stadium declined. Some time in the 1990s the grandstand was fenced off, and as of 2012 the structure has not been used since. Significance Hamtramck Stadium is one of only 12 remaining Negro League baseball stadiums. Of those 12, the majority hosted only occasional league games, and only Hinchliffe Stadium in Paterson, New Jersey and Rickwood Field in Birmingham, Alabama were in use longer than Hamtramck Stadium. At least 16 future members of the Hall of Fame played at Hamtramck Stadium, including Satchel Paige; Josh Gibson; Turkey Stearnes of the Detroit Stars; and Willie Wells, Cool Papa Bell, and Mule Suttles of the Detroit Wolves. The stadium was also the site of the deciding games of the 1930 Negro National League Championship Series, which the Detroit Stars eventually lost to the St. Louis Stars in seven games. Description Hamtramck Stadium, as originally built, seated about 8,000 people in the concrete-and-steel grandstand. Most seats were on wooden benches, but a few box seats were separated from the rest by iron rails. Bleachers down the right-field line seat held about 1,000 more people. Later renovations reduced the grandstand to approximately half of its original size, and it now has a seating capacity of approximately 1,500. The steel frame of the grandstand is original. Grandstand seating begins off the ground, and is accessed via three concrete ramps. The wooden bleacher seats sit on wooden deckes, which are supported by steel I-beams. The I-beam structure continues above the bleachers, and supports a corrugated metal roof. Chain link fences behind the bleachers and atop the roof protected cars from foul balls. As of 2012, a fencing surrounded the grandstand to deter vandals. Although covered with graffiti, the structure is still in good shape. The field has a relatively short distance to the left field fence from home plate (), contrasted with a deep right field (), and a substantial center field (). The outfield was surrounded by a twelve-foot high corrugated metal fence, a fairly unusual and expensive feature for its time. The fence has now been removed, but the field itself remains unobstructed. The pitcher's mound and flagpole remain from the original field.

The album sold over 30,000 copies in its first week and debuted at number one on the weekly Gaon albums chart. The single \\"I Wish\\" has peaked at number eight on the weekly Gaon singles chart and earned F.T. Island one K-Chart win on Mnet's music television program M! Countdown.

Guitarist Choi Jong-hoon stated that the band \\"worked on everything from guitar rift, sound and song genre\\". The album includes five Korean-language tracks previously recorded in Japanese. Speaking of these tracks, bassist Lee Jae-jin explained that \\"it was too much of a waste to lock up our songs [in Japan]\\". The band rewrote the lyrics in Korean and suggested to FNC Entertainment to include them on the album. Drummer Choi Min-hwan explained that the band chose \\"the best\\" songs to rewrite, while taking the \\"album‚Äôs mood\\" into consideration.

The episode originally aired on NBC on October 4, 2012. The episode was written by Jonathan Green and Gabe Miller, and was directed by David Rogers. The episode guest stars Randall Park as Jim and Pam's actor friend, Steve. The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) brags about his discovery that he is related to First Lady Michelle Obama. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) finds his new job as Assistant Regional Manager difficult. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) attempts to teach Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) the Dothraki language from HBO series Game of Thrones so that she can impress Andy's educated family. Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) tells Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) that Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) may be having an affair; meanwhile, Jim reveals his entrepreneurial plans to Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) in the warehouse. \\"Andy's Ancestry\\" received moderately positive reviews from television critics. Many felt that the emotional elements in the episode were effective and that the cold opening was particularly humorous, and noted that the episode bore stylistic similarities to early episodes of the show. Some, however, were slightly disappointed by the episode's various subplots. \\"Andy's Ancestry\\" was viewed by 4.14 million viewers and received a 2.2 rating among adults between the age of 18 and 49. The episode ranked fourth in its timeslot and was also the highest-rated NBC series of the night. Synopsis In the cold open, an Asian man (Randall Park) arrives to the office and sits at Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) desk, saying good morning to Dwight. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), not knowing the man, asks who he is. The man claims to be the real Jim, and offers proof: he is able to recall his last sales, he knows his voicemail password, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) gives him a kiss, and he has a picture of Pam and himself and their two Asian children. Dwight is confused, but Pam explains in a talking head that Jim is at the dentist, and that the man is an actor friend of Jim and Pam's named Steve. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) demands that Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) research his family tree. To spite him, she falsely tells him that he is related to U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama. He begins to brag about his discovery, which causes his co-workers to wonder if Andy's family ever owned slaves. In order to get back at his co-workers, Andy asks Nellie to \\"dig up dirt\\" on the rest of the office. In turn, she and Pam make up more fake facts as a prank. Jim realizes this prank when Andy \\"reveals\\" Jim is related to Richard Nixon, an inside joke between Jim and Pam. It is later revealed by Andy's mother that the Bernards never owned slaves: they simply transported them. Pam has been helping Nellie practice for a driving test. The two bond after Nellie shows appreciation for Pam's art. After telling her that she is worried that her husband Jim is not telling her something, Nellie immediately states that Jim is probably having an affair. Nellie later asks Pam to paint a mural in the warehouse. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) has been promoted to Assistant Regional Manager and as a result is inspired to find ways to be more productive, for himself and the office. However, his ideas for the office are ignored by Andy, leading to a discussion with Jim in the warehouse about their increasing dissatisfaction with Dunder Mifflin. Jim tells Darryl about his sports marketing job opportunity in Philadelphia and offers him a possible position. However, as Jim has yet to tell Pam, Darryl says he should before going forward. When Pam comes back, Jim reveals the job opportunity to Pam, who, despite giving her approval, is upset that Jim did not consult her beforehand. Dwight attempts to teach Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) the Dothraki language from the HBO series Game of Thrones so that she can impress Andy's educated family, with Erin being unaware that it is a fictional language. Andy, however, points this out, leaving Erin dejected. However, as the office leaves for the day, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) gives Erin a Dothraki farewell. Production This episode guest stars Randall Park as Jim and Pam's friend Steve. \\"Andy's Ancestry\\" was written by co-executive producers Jonathan Green and Gabe Miller, making it their first joint writing credit for the series. The episode was directed by series editor David Rogers. This was Roger's seventh directing credit for the series, he previously directed the seventh season entry \\"Ultimatum\\". The episode guest stars Randall Park as Jim and Pam's actor friend. After the release of the episode's plot synopsis, Geni.com, a genealogy and social networking website, claimed that Ed Helms is in fact Michelle Obama's 18th cousin once removed. The NBC website later produced the \\"real\\" Bernard family tree after the release of the full episode. Cultural references Dwight attempts to teach the Dothraki language from the popular book series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin. The books had also been turned into the HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones. Dwight later compares learning Dothraki to learning Klingon, a fictional language from franchise Star Trek. Andy refers to Ladysmith Black Mambazo as \\"Ladysmith African-American Mambazo\\" in an attempt to prove he is not racist. Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) later changes Andy's ringtone to the song \\"Dixie\\". After Andy asks her to find information regarding the relatives of the office members, Nellie intentionally lies and tells Andy that Kevin is related to John Wayne Gacy and John Wayne Bobbitt. He is disappointed to learn that he is not related to either John Wayne or Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson, whom he erroneously calls \\"Wayne\\". Andy also informs the office that Jim is related to former president Richard Nixon and that Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) is related to infamous axe-murder suspect Lizzie Borden. Before he realizes that all of the office members ancestors are fakes, Dwight admits that his were members of the German American Bund, a pro-Nazi group in the 1930s. Broadcast and reception =Ratings= \\"Andy's Ancestry\\" originally aired on NBC on October 4, 2012.

Despite this, The Office was the highest-rated NBC television program of the night. =Reviews= Erik Adams of The A.V. Club gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it a \\"B\\". Adams highlighted the serious discussion between Darryl and Jim in the warehouse, noting that \\"Jim's extrication is something to root for\\", and that it honored \\"Craig Robinson's dedication to the show\\". While feeling that some of the episode's subplots were forced, he complimented the Pam and Nellie pairing due to \\"Pam's past ability to break through [people like] Angela and Dwight's defenses\\". Bonnie Stiernberg of Paste magazine noted that, despite Andy's regression to \\"his old ways\\", it was beneficial for the episode and allowed for many jokes to be played out. Furthermore, Stiernberg applauded the subtle drama that ran throughout the entry, writing Darryl, Erin, and Pete's interactions with Andy were important to the overall storyline. Mark Trammell of TV Equals named it \\"the best episode of the final season of The Office to date\\" because it \\"played to the show's strengths\\". Furthermore, he complimented the character development of Nellie, writing that she \\"really started to grow on me this week\\" and that his favorite line was Darryl's \\"words of wisdom\\" to Jim: \\"It's not real until your wife is on board.\\" Michael Tedder of New York magazine gave the episode a positive review and noted that \\"It's been a while since The Office was this surprising and moving.\\" He wrote that the main plot allowed for \\"overdue development\\" in regards to other characters and applauded the continued drama involving Pam and Jim; he called the last shot \\"quietly heartbreaking\\". He did, however, call it a \\"particularly overstuffed episode\\", and felt that Erin's subplot should have been moved to a different episode in the season. E! Online called Pete \\"especially charming\\" after \\"Andy's Ancestry\\", and named him one of the \\"Best Things in Pop Culture\\". Joseph Kratzer of WhatCulture! awarded the episode four out of five stars and said \\"The triumphant return of The Office continues with another enjoyable episode.\\" He explained that the success of the first episodes of the ninth season \\"comes from a fluidity not seen in recent years, an organic component that helped make the series such a success in its second and third seasons\\". He argued it was not \\"the tightest plotted episode\\" but that it was \\"better than 90% of last season\\". IGN writer Cindy White awarded the episode an 8.2, designating a \\"great\\" episode. She applauded the fact that \\"the show is returning to its roots\\" as well as the fact that the actors themselves \\"seem more invested\\" in the series. She also called the conversation between Darryl and Jim a \\"nice change of pace\\". She concluded that the plot allowed for a \\"good source of laughs in the smartly written\\" episode. Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode three and a half stars out of five and called it \\"another decent episode\\". He wrote that Pam and Nellie's bonding was the subplot that \\"worked best\\". Nick Campbell of TV.com wrote that \\"the writers [are] trying to shove Andy Bernard in a Michael Scott-shaped hole.\\" Furthermore, he called Nellie \\"the greatest square peg of them all.\\" Brett Harrison Davinger of the California Literary Review, despite enjoying the tension between Pam and Jim, felt that the main story never went anywhere.

She was the daughter of Robert Morland Stanley, an old-time fiddler who recorded with her on some of her records. Early life Roba's father was an old-time music fiddler and she was exposed to the music in the home.Bluegrass Messengers, Roba Stanley Biography, with interview excerpts. She learned to play the guitar and sing in the home and by 1923 (at age 15) went with her father to square dances. Their home was \\"a mecca\\" for early country music near Atlanta, due to her father's prowess as a fiddler. He was the winner of the Georgia Old-Time Fiddlers Convention in 1920. Among the friends he brought to the house was Fiddlin' Johnny Carson, whom Roba remembered playing music with at her house. Career =Music= Recording Roba recorded for Okeh Records in 1924 and 1925, performing solo and as part of her family's Stanley Trio. She also made records with Bill Patterson. Of her four July 1924 recordings, two were labeled \\"Roba Stanley and Bill Patterson\\" and the other two were \\"The Stanly Trio\\". With Patterson she made Devilish Mary and Mr. Chicken. With the trio she made Nelie Grey and Whoa Mule! She recorded three more in December 1924, All night long (Roba and her father Bob Stanley), Little Frankie (with Bill Patterson), and Railroad Bill (with her father Bob Stanley and with Bill Patterson). Her last record, in July 1925, was solo. She made Old Maid Blues and Single Life. Performing She performed live on Atlanta's WSB radio for a year. She went on to perform off the air with other Georgia musicians, including Gid Tanner and her father Bob Stanley (himself a fiddler, winner of one of the Georgia Fiddler's Conventions). Family Her music career ended when she married Frank Ellsworth Baldwin and moved to Florida with him. She was no longer near a recording studio and her husband did not like her performing in public, so she gave away her guitar. Age when she first recorded =Either 14 or 16 years old= There has been some concern over her age at the time she recorded. One article that mentioned the concern said she was either 14 or 16, and probably was called the latter to avoid child labor laws. Another says that research revealed her to be born in 1910; however the research itself was not identified.AllMusic article about Roba Stanley =Evidence for age 16 at recording time= Census records indicate that she would have been 16 at the time she recorded in 1924. From the census, we know she was born between January 17 and April 28 of 1908. That would make her 16 in the July 1924 recording session. Additionally, her family listed her birth date as February 11, 1908, which supports the census data.

It is one of several species to have narrow pointed phyllodes but is distinctive in having them arranged in groups of 3 to 6. Acacia riceana bears close resemblance to Acacia derwentiana which has similar phyllodes (only narrower) and distribution. It has dense foliage with weeping branches and flowers in anywhere from July to January with seed pods maturing in January and February. Taxonomy and naming English botanist John Stevens Henslow described Rice's wattle in 1839 from a plant grown in Cambridge University Botanic Garden, from seed sent from Tasmania. It still bears its original name. The species was named in honour of Thomas Spring Rice who was Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time. It is related to Acacia axillaris but this species has erect rather than weeping branches. Distribution Acacia riceana is endemic to the southeast corner of Tasmania where it grows from sea level to 900 m (3000 ft). Its main populations center around the Derwent, Huon and Prosser River Valleys, although small populations are also located on the slopes of the Ironbound Range in the state's far south.

History Plan of salvation in German. The first German to be converted to the LDS Church was an immigrant to the USA named Jakob Zundel in 1836. Although one British Mormon convert had briefly worked in Germany, the first official of the church to arrive in Germany was Orson Hyde on 27 June 1841 as part of his journey to Palestine. He was delayed in Frankfurt by a visa problem and began to learn German. When he returned to Germany on his trip back from Palestine, he spent 30 January to August 1842 in Regensburg and wrote \\"Ein Ruf aus der W√ºste\\" (\\"A Cry out of the Wilderness\\") whilst he was there. It was published in Frankfurt and was the first LDS Church publication in the German language. The first converts were baptized in Germany in 1851. Brigham Young sent Daniel Carn to establish the first German mission in 1852 which he did in Hamburg. Carn also oversaw the publication of a German language version of the Book of Mormon which was published in Hamburg 25 May 1852. He was eventually banished from Hamburg, then a sovereign state, due to his attempts to convert Germans to Mormonism but he continued to prostelyse Germans in the then Danish territory of Schleswig-Holstein. Most early converts emigrated to the United States and, by 1854, the short-lived Hamburg branch was dissolved. Church involvement in Germany resumed in 1860, but was limited due to persecution which continued until World War I. After World War I, the government became more tolerant of religious freedom, and the church received substantial growth. In the first half of the 20th century Germany had more converts to Mormonism than any other non-English speaking country. By 1925 there were 6,125 members in the German-Austrian Mission, and 5,305 members in the Swiss-German Mission. The first German LDS meeting house was built in 1929 in Selbongen, East Prussia (now Ze≈ÇwƒÖgi in Poland). 13,402 Mormons lived in the West German (including Austria as of November 1938) and East German Missions in 1939; at least 996 members were killed during World War II, including more than 400 adult men, about 10% of priesthood holders. Under the Nazi Government of 1933 - 1945, no Mormon congregation was stopped from worshipping and few individual Mormons were persecuted (and only for transgressions that any German of the time would have been punished for). Gestapo agents silently attended services, likely investigating neighbors' complaints of seditious activities, but no punishment came to the church. An estimated 3-5% of adult male members joined the Nazi Party‚Äîrequired of state employees‚Äîand speakers avoided criticizing the government or, after the German declaration of war against the United States, emphasizing the church's relationship with that country. The government ordered the church to avoid preaching about \\"Jewish\\" topics like \\"Zion\\" and \\"Israel\\", so leaders told members to not sing hymns with such words. An American Mormon student who attended a speech by Adolf Hitler in 1930 wrote of how \\"the greatest orator I had ever heard\\" transfixed him and thousands of others. After recovering from the speech in his hotel room and briefly meeting \\"the would-be Dictator of Germany\\" himself, the visitor predicted that \\"Whether for good or evil\\", Hitler's \\"dominating, compelling\\" personality would be ... a power that would be felt\\". After Hitler took power, American Mormon missionaries' views of the government during the 1930s varied. While also praising Hitler's oratory skill and approving of his unifying a politically divided country, they saw arrests of dissidents, enforcement of Nazi eugenics, and widespread fear of the regime. The Nuremberg Laws increased access to and interest in genealogical records, and some saw the monthly eintopf as similar to Fast Sunday, but mandatory Hitler Youth membership ended most Mormon auxiliary organizations for young people. However, there was still opposition towards Nazism within the LDS - Helmuth H√ºbener ended up being beheaded for anti-Nazi activities, and his colleague Karl-Heinz Schnibbe spent five years in a camp for his part. H√ºbener was the youngest opponent of the Third Reich to be sentenced to death by the infamous Special People's Court (Volksgerichtshof) and executed. Following World War II, members of the church in Germany found themselves divided among two nations. Members continued to maintain contact with the church in the west. In the fall of 1961 three stakes were created in Berlin (Germany's first), Stuttgart and Hamburg. In 1982, the Freiberg German Democratic Republic Stake was created. On June 19, 1985, the Freiberg GDR Temple was dedicated. It is the only temple to have been constructed in what was a communist bloc country. In 1987, the Frankfurt, West Germany Temple was dedicated. In 2020, the LDS Church canceled services and other public gatherings indefinitely in response to the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.Lovett, Ian. \\"Mormon Church Cancels Services World-Wide Amid Coronavirus Crisis\\", The Wall Street Journal, 12 March 2020.

It was an operation to detach all of northern China from the power of the Nationalist Government and put it under Japanese control or influence. In China the affair is referred to as the ‚ÄúNorth China Incident‚Äù corresponding only to the time between the series of \\"North China Autonomy Movements\\" orchestrated by the Japanese army since May 1935 and the founding of the Hebei‚ÄìChahar Political Council under Song Zheyuan in December.Naotaka Uchida„ÄÅ„ÄéËèØÂåó‰∫ãÂ§â„ÅÆÁ†îÁ©∂ -Â°òÊ≤ΩÂÅúÊà¶ÂçîÂÆö„Å®ËèØÂåóÂç±Ê©ü‰∏ã„ÅÆÊó•‰∏≠Èñ¢‰øÇ‰∏Ä‰πù‰∏â‰∫åÔΩû‰∏Ä‰πù‰∏â‰∫î- „Äè„ÄÅKyuko Shoin, 2006„ÄÅpages 5-6 It is recognized as ranking alongside the Manchurian Incident, the Shanghai Incident, and the Marco Polo Bridge Incident.  Development of the strategy  Between the winter of 1934 and January 1935 small-scale clashes between the Chinese and Japanese armies were occurring frequently along the cease-fire lines established by the Tanggu Truce and the Japanese army was coming to the view that they needed to clear anti-Japanese forces out of northern China. On 7 December 1934 a decision was reached at a meeting of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Ministries of Japan concerning issues relating to policy toward China and an agenda was laid out to see to it that the power of the Chinese government did not extend to North China by setting up a pro-Japanese puppet government and extending Japan‚Äôs economic rights and interests in the area, and by suppressing anti-Japanese sentiments there. In addition, the same policy was also advocated at the Dalian Conference, a meeting of intelligence operatives working in China and Mongolia hosted by the Kwantung Army early in January 1935. Thus, the Japanese China Garrison Army and Kwantung Army concluded two pacts with the Nationalist government backed by their military might, the He‚ÄìUmezu Agreement of June 10 and the Chin‚ÄìDoihara Agreement of June 27. The two agreements respectively made Nationalist soldiers and officials withdraw from Hebei, and made the Nationalists and the semi- independent 29th Army pull out of Chahar. The KMT Wang-Chiang Coalition, which came into being in March 1932 with Chiang as Chairman of the National Military Commission and Wang as Premier, made these concessions to Japan through their decision to adopt the policy of ‚Äúresistance while negotiating‚Äù, yimian dikang yimian jiaoshe in Chinese or the Eight-Character Policy, the name under which Wang promoted it because it comprises eight Chinese characters. This was part of their larger strategy of ‚Äúfirst internal pacification, then external resistance‚Äù or xian annei hou rangwai.Wang Ke-wen, ‚ÄúNorth China Autonomy,‚Äù in Modern China: An Encyclopedia of History, Culture, and Nationalism, ed. Wang Ke-wen (New York: Garland Pub., 1998),246.  Formation of puppet governments  In contemporary north China the people had witnessed the remarkable events in Manchuria while dissatisfaction was rising among the citizens and various military cliques due to heavy taxation and exploitation by the Nationalist government. Chiang Kai-shek's leverage in north China receded and in June 1935 Bai Jianwu launched an abortive coup d'√©tat in Fengtai with the aim of establishing a pro-Japanese and pro-Manchukuo government. Political and economic grievances increased among the masses and movements for autonomy gathered momentum in places like Shandong, Shanxi, and Hebei where the Xianghe Incident occurred in October in which peasants disavowed the Nationalist government in opposition to a KMT tax hike and demanded self-government against oppressive taxation. Then, on 3 November 1935 the Nationalists undertook a currency reform with British support and introduced the new silver standard and currency management system, but upon recalling the old currency they confronted more separatist tendencies when the Japanese-backed military leaders of north China refused to hand over the silver.Brett Sheehan, Trust in troubled times: money, banks, and state-society relations in republican Tianjin (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2003), 170-171. The Japanese army feared that the currency reform would strengthen of the Chinese government's economic control over north China, and they made efforts to establish a pro-Japanese puppet government in Hebei and Chahar. However, because the Japanese encountered strong resistance from the Nationalist government and because various Chinese military leaders failed to respond to their invitations, on 25 November 1935 they established as a provisional measure the East Hebei Autonomous Council, a government under Yin Ju-keng that would have jurisdiction over an area of Hebei Province demilitarized by the Tanggu Truce. Chiang Kai-shek did not recognize Yin's declaration of autonomy and on 18 December 1935, in order to prevent the other factions in northern China from declaring their independence in the same manner, he set up the Hebei‚ÄìChahar Political Council under Song Zheyuan encompassing Beiping (now Beijing), Tianjin, and the provinces of Hebei and Chahar. In his address upon taking office, Song proclaimed a policy of anti-communism, Sino-Japanese friendship, and respect for the will of the people. At first the East Hebei Autonomous Council thought that the Hebei‚ÄìChahar Political Council was a similar type of autonomous body and considered a merger, but this idea was abandoned when they realized that the Hebei‚ÄìChahar Political Council was effectively under the control of the Nationalist government and on 25 December they asserted their full autonomy and organized the East Hebei Autonomous Anti-Communist Government. Thus, through the manoeuvrings of Japan, the Nationalist government of China, and a variety of Chinese warlords, two different anti-communist and pro-Japanese autonomous governments were born in northern China. On 13 January 1936 the Japanese cabinet endorsed the First Administrative Policy Toward North China, which made keeping north China separate from the Nationalist government into Japan's official national policy. This policy was reaffirmed in the second and third administrative policies of 11 August 1936 and 16 April 1937.  Aftermath in China  In China frustrations with the government's policies gradually grew. When Wang Jingwei was wounded in an assassination attempt in November 1935 he left the government to recuperate.Hideo Kobayashi and Michio Hayashi„ÄÅ„ÄéÊó•‰∏≠Êà¶‰∫âÂè≤Ë´ñ Ê±™Á≤æË°õÊîøÊ®©„Å®‰∏≠ÂõΩÂç†È†òÂú∞„Äè„ÄÅOcha no Mizushobo„ÄÅ2005„ÄÅp.45-48 However, at the stage of the Kuomintang's Fifth Congress the same year Chiang Kai-shek did not yet close the door to a diplomatic solution, stating that \\"If the tipping point hasn't come, we shouldn't talk about sacrifices. We will not accept infringements on our national sovereignty, but up to that point we should strive for friendly relations and political mediation and should make the utmost efforts for peace.\\" In the middle of April 1936 Japanese decided to reinforce the Japanese China Garrison Army and posted troops in Beiping, Tianjin, and Fengtai in May and June. The Nationalist government notified Japan of its opposition to the move and protests against Japan's policies by civilians and students occurred in Beiping, Tianjin, and other cities. The Chinese people's spirit of resistance towards Japan greatly increased and skirmishes happened repeatedly between Chinese and Japanese forces in the vicinity of Fengtai where the Japanese troops had just been stationed. Furthermore, attacks on Japanese people in places throughout China became frequent. Japan planned to expand the North China buffer state further, but their defeat in the Suiyuan Campaign only strengthened China's will to resist. After the Xian Incident of 12 December 1936, the detention of Chiang Kai-shek by his subordinate Zhang Xueliang, the Republic of China and the Red Army, with the brokerage of the Comintern, concluded the Second United Front and a definite shift for the Nationalists from anti-communism to resistance against the Japanese.

In the summer of 2017, they showed up at the Whitney Museum wearing an enormous sign (about 3‚Äô H x 2‚Äô W) emblazoned with the message: ‚ÄòPortable Art‚Äô. Liz-N-Val have an improvisational attitude that combines space, time, materials and form as conceptual events. To the present time, they have continued to explore and redefine the parameters of Art: its making and viewing. For example, the sign: ‚ÄòWET PAINT‚Äô has shifted, over time, from convention to concept - to appearing on T- shirts and devolving into a possible exhibition.

It consisted of a metal or concrete dome, about wide and about tall, embedded in the road surface. They were usually painted yellow and often decorated with retro-reflective glass beads or \\"cats eyes\\". The name has its origins from the Northern Beaches area of Sydney and was derived from the early days of motoring when policemen would be deployed at busy street corners to direct traffic, before traffic signals became widespread. Silent cops were placed in the middle of street intersections at cross roads, and turning drivers were expected to drive around one, keeping it to the right of the vehicle when turning right or left. They were also placed in the centre of the terminating street at T-intersections to force drivers turning in or out of the street to be on the correct side of the road rather than cut the corner. The use of \\"silent cops\\" has been phased out in Australia, due to changes in the recommended method of performing turns (the introduction of the diamond turn at signalised intersections), and the hazard they posed to motorcyclists and pedestrians.

Carl Katter is also known for having been involved in the push for LGBT rights during his political career. Early years and background Carl Katter was born in Brisbane, Queensland, and grew up in the northwest of the state. In particular, the small country town of Charters Towers. His parents were federal MP Bob Katter Sr. and Joy Katter, and he is a member of a pioneering Queensland family. Carl came out as gay at the age of 18.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0CF3wz2-wU Growing up gay in rural North Queensland, Carl felt he often experienced negative attitudes from some of those in his community that existed towards lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people at the time. Bob Katter Sr, Carl's father, who died when Carl was 12 years old, was a member of the Australian Parliament representing the federal electorate of Kennedy. The younger Katter was heavily influenced by his father's labour and trade unionist politics, and by his father's belief in equality for people of all races. Activism In August 2011, Bob Katter Jr, Katter's half-brother and member of Parliament representing the seat of Kennedy, like his father before him, appeared at a right wing Christian rally at the Great Hall in Parliament House and decried same-sex marriage. Carl reportedly watched on television as his half-brother mocked same-sex marriage and suggested that it \\"deserves to be laughed at and ridiculed.\\" Deciding publicly to come out regarding his own homosexuality, Carl Katter join the push for the legalisation of same-sex marriage in Australia. He approached GetUp!, an independent Australian grass-roots community advocacy organisation, and with their help produced an online video message to counter his brother's comments. In a television interview with George Negus, Katter said that he could not \\"just sit back\\" and allow Bob Katter Jr. to denigrate gay people and the campaign for same-sex marriage, saying: \\"it's hurtful, it's dangerous, and it's really inappropriate.\\" Katter has stated that he believes that it is better to combat his brother's views and educate rather than attack his brother on a personal level. He also holds the work that his brother has done for the Kennedy electorate and elsewhere in high regard. Carl is a member of the Labor Environment Action Network, and wants to continue to build on Labor's approach to climate change in the implementation of the party's policy when it is next elected to national government.

The church has attracted much attention for its dramatic s√©ances and exorcisms of demons. The Eloyi Christian Church was founded by Jakoba Keiphile in 1955 in the small village of Tsetsebjwe, to the southeast of Selebi Phikwe. The church fights evil spirits and their agents, and heals people. The church began to expand in 2005 after Jakoba grew old and handed over responsibility to his children. As of 2005 the church was based in the north part of Botswana. In early 2005 church members hunted and dismembered a snake that they said was terrorizing a Tlokweng family. During the 2005-2007 period the church gained a large amount of media coverage due to the dramatic exorcisms of demons practiced during its services. In s√©ances the church revives traditional Tswana practices in an Old Testament and new form. By the end of 2007 the church had between 4,000 and 6,000 members in branches throughout Botswana and in South Africa and it has more than 150 branches currently. The members were typically low-paid and not highly educated, but holding steady jobs. The church has its origins in the American revivalist movement of the late nineteenth century. The church baptises its members with full immersion in Jordan. The church is the subject of the 56-minute documentary film Encountering Eloyi (2008) directed by Richard Werbner. The film tells of a childless couple who have tried both traditional medicine and Western hospitals without success. The woman turns to the church to be healed of her barrenness.

Details  If a driver approaches a four-way intersection and wishes to make a turn opposite of their side of the road (e.g. a right turn if driving on the left side of the road, as in the UK or Australia), they should turn in a wide arc that passes close to the centre of the intersection. This is nowadays the standard type of driver's-side turning manoeuvre at a four-way intersection. In particular, at intersections with traffic lights, it enables a traffic signal phase to allow traffic approaching the intersection from two opposing directions to both turn right simultaneously without colliding. The diamond turn is distinguished from a historically required manoeuvre wherein drivers simultaneously turning right from opposing directions were required to turn around a silent cop in the centre of the intersection, which resulted in the two vehicles looping past one another with their driver's sides adjacent. This type of turn was eliminated, as it was unsuitable for intersections with traffic lights that used simultaneous right- turn green light phases for more than one approaching street.

Background Margolis was born in Vilnius, Lithuania in 1921. In 1941, when the Nazis occupied Lithuania, Margolis was sent to live with a Christian family. Of Jewish birth, she instead decided to voluntarily enter the Jewish Vilna ghetto in September 1942. She entered the resistance movement there and became active in the underground. She joined the Fareynikte Partizaner Organizatsye (the United Partisan Organisation), formed that same year by poet Abba Kovner. Margolis wrote Everyone was anxious to fight... Our mission was to acquire weapons, complete militarily preparations, all with the aim of provoking an uprising in the ghetto. If we perished it would be with honour, having proved to humanity that we are not sheep going meekly to the slaughter. In June 1943 Heinrich Himmler commanded the extermination of the ghetto. 4000 Jewish residents were sent to death camps and killed; 4000 more were sent to labour camps. Margolis and her future husband were one of the few hundreds that survived the ghetto, by escaping to the surrounding forests. They contracted typhus but lived to continue their work with the resistance movement, joining a new unit and blowing up German infrastructure. Margolis was the only member of her family to survive the Holocaust . Published in Polish in 1999 by Towarzystwo Milosnikow Wilna i Ziemi Wilenskiej and Rachel Margolis. Translation copyright 2005 Yad Vashem. p. vii Post war After the war, Margolis gained a Ph.D. in biology and was a teacher until the end of the 1980s. She helped establish Lithuania's only Holocaust museum, the Green House in Vilnius. Her work in the resistance has been honoured by US congress and the British House of Lords. Margolis's 2010 memoir A Partisan of Vilna recounts the author's escape from the Vilna Ghetto with the FPO (United Partisan Organization) resistance movement and the time spent in the forests of Lithuania with the partisans, active on sabotaging missions. Margolis found and published the long-lost diary of Kazimierz Sakowicz, a Polish Christian journalist who witnessed the Ponary massacre outside Vilnius, where tens of thousands of Jews were murdered. Margolis reconstructed Sakowicz's diary from fragments of paper found in lemonade bottles, text written on a 1941 calendar and other papers held in archives that were not accessible under Soviet rule. Beginning in 2008, Lithuanian prosecutor general wanted to question Margolis as part of the investigation of the Koniuchy massacre when Soviet and Jewish partisans killed at least 38 civilians. Lithuanian newspapers referred to her as a terrorist and a murderer. Margolis also lived in Rechovot, Israel.

This put her into financial crisis. However, according to the only statement from Thanh Thao in which she denied it, as she said that whether it was right or wrong, the composer of these songs, Phuong Uyen, should be the one to clarify. When Hien Thuc announced the release of Co Don Minh Em also caused Thanh Thao some problems but she let it pass.

A sped-up version of the song appears in both the film Baby Snakes and its subsequent soundtrack, as well as best of album Son of Cheap Thrills. Structure and meaning The song's structure is similar-sounding to previous work by Zappa. However though, in this particular song, Zappa satirically added a more pop feel to it to go along with the theme of the song. The song addresses the stereotypes affiliated with the disco era. The vain tone of the song is set by the lyrics \\"Leave his hair alone, but you can kiss his comb.\\" The lyrics \\"Disco boy, do the bump every night, 'til the disco girl who's really right, gonna fall for your line, and feed you a box full of Chicken Delight\\" indicate that the disco boy isn't looking for love, but just a one- night stand. The lyric \\"but thank the lord that you still got hands, to help you do that jerkin' that'll blot out your disco sorrow\\" alludes to his lust for the disco girl and that when he loses her he can always just masturbate.

Meanwhile, Emperor Francis II of Austria recalled Archduke Charles from Germany to hold northeast Italy. In March Bonaparte launched an offensive designed to break through the Austrian army's defenses. At Valvasone, the French encountered part of their opponents' army and drove it back. For the loss of 500 men, the French inflicted 700 casualties on the Austrians and captured six guns.

The Luna Sharpshooters, also known as the \\"Marksmen of Death\\" (Spanish: Tiradores de la Muerte), was an elite unit formed by General Antonio Luna to serve under the Philippine Revolutionary Army. They became famous for fighting fiercer than the regular Filipino army soldiers. Most of the members of this unit came from the old Spanish Army which fought during the Philippine Revolution. History On February 11, 1899, eight infantrymen, formerly under Captains M√°rquez and Jaro, were sent by Secretary of War Baldomero Aguinaldo to Luna, then Assistant Secretary of War. The infantrymen were disarmed by the Americans. So, they journeyed to be commissioned in the regular Filipino army. Seeing their desire to serve in the army, Luna took them in and from there their group grew and emerged as the Luna Sharpshooters. The sharpshooters became famous for their fierce fighting and proved their worth by being the usual spearheading unit in every major battle in the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. After the Battle of Calumpit from April 25 to 27, 1899, only seven or eight of them remained in the regular Filipino army. In the Battle of Paye on December 19, 1899, Bonifacio Mariano, a sharpshooter under the command of General Licerio Ger√≥nimo, killed General Henry Ware Lawton, making the latter the highest ranking casualty during the course of the war. Related units During the war, Luna also formed other units similar to the sharpshooters. One would be the unit commanded by Rosendo Sim√≥n de Pajarillo called Los Bandoleros. The unit emerged from a group of ten men wanting to volunteer in the regular Filipino army. Luna, still thinking of the defeat at the Battle of Caloocan, sent the men away at first. However, he soon changed his mind and decided to give the men an initiation. After taking breakfast, he ordered a subordinate, Colonel Queri, to prepare arms and ammunition for the ten men. Then, the men boarded a train destined towards Malinta, which was American- held territory. After giving orders to the men, he let them go and watched them with his telescope. The men, succeeding their mission, eventually returned unharmed. Admiring their bravery, he organized them into a guerrilla unit of around 50 members. This unit would see action in the Second Battle of Caloocan. Another unit would be the Guardia Negra (Black Guard), a 25-man guerrilla unit under a Lieutenant Garc√≠a. Garc√≠a, one of Luna's favorites, was a modest but brave soldier. His unit was tasked to approach the enemy by surprise and quickly return to camp. Luna had admired Garc√≠a's unit very much that he wanted to increase their size. However, Garc√≠a declined the offer. Jose Alejandrino, the chief army engineer and one of Luna's aides, stated that he never heard of Garc√≠a and his unit again after Luna's resignation on February 28.

After success in other minor roles, including romantic comedies, Little Accident (1928), Blind Mice (1930), Child of Manhattan (1932) and Domino (1932). She was also in the cast of the drama, Heat Lightning (1933) and the musical Merrily We Roll Along (1934). After marriage and divorce, Wall resumed her career as an actress in Hollywood at the age of 30, Her first roles were uncredited and not until Winged Victory (1944) did Wall receive an on-screen credit, albeit far down in the \\"other\\" players. She received credit in Charlie Chan's Meeting At Midnight (1944) series film. Proving to be a versatile actress, Wall took on many different roles including working women, secretaries, mothers and wives, acting in 47 films. Although predominately known from her drama, comedy and romance roles, she also was featured in a wide variety of genres including: mystery, crime, family, adventure, thriller, western, war, action, film-noir, musical, and biography, as well as dabbling in fantasy, history, horror, sport and even science- fiction films. Wall was the original choice for the role of Dolly Tate in the 1950 MGM film Annie Get Your Gun. When Betty Hutton replaced Judy Garland in the role of Annie Oakley, Benay Venuta took over the role of Dolly Tate.\\"Biography: Geraldine Wall.\\" IMDb. Retrieved: September 16, 2012. With the dawn of television, like many other actors, Wall began working in the new medium in the 1950s. Finding not only recurring roles but a number of other \\"one-offs\\", she appeared in 17 television series, acting until 1970. Wall's stage, screen and television career includes notable character roles including, One Man's Way, The Song of Bernadette, Charlie Chan in Black Magic, The Fountainhead, Black Widow and Please Don't Eat the Daisies. She made six guest appearances on the popular series, Perry Mason, starring Raymond Burr. Perhaps her most memorable role was as murderess Abigail E. Leeds in the 1957 episode, \\"The Case of the Baited Hook.\\" She also made three appearances on The Dick Van Dyke Show TV series.\\"Geraldine Wall.\\" Turner Classic Movies.

History  The State Bar of New Mexico first met on January 19, 1886 in Santa Fe, New Mexico as a voluntary professional organization. There were 29 original members, and William A. Vincent was the first president. In 1925, state statute caused the State Bar to operate as an agency of the New Mexico Supreme Court. In 1978, the State Bar of New Mexico (State Bar) was incorporated under the laws of the State of New Mexico. Structure The SBNM is governed by a Board of Bar Commissioners, consisting of 19 members elected by district and one from each of the Senior Lawyer, Young Lawyer, and Paralegal Divisions. SBNM enforces the rule that New Mexico lawyers must complete 12 credits of Continuing Legal Education each year. SBNM publishes the weekly New Mexico Bar Bulletin and the quarterly New Mexico Lawyer. In 1995, SBNM's Paralegal Division was established to serve the needs of New Mexico legal assistants.

Typically a tandem repeat of two DUF1608 domains are contained in a single MSTP protein chain and these proteins self-assemble into the protective proteinaceous surface layer (S-layer) structure that encompasses the cell. The S-layer, which is found in most Archaea, and in many bacteria, serves many crucial functions including protection from deleterious extracellular substances. Discovery of the Methanosarcinales S-layer The first S-layers were discovered in bacteria in the 1950s and the presence of S-layers in many Archaea was determined through microscopic (both light and electron) studies of Archaea. The presence of an S-layer in a member of the Methanosarcinales was determined in the 1980s by electron microscope (EM) studies examining the cell morphology of Methanosarcina mazei. This, and other EM studies, confirmed that the cell envelope structure of the Methanosarcinales is composed of a cytoplasmic membrane (CM) with an additional barrier (the S-layer) external to the CM. Under conditions of low osmolarity the S-layer is extensively decorated with a polysaccharide, termed methanochondroitin, and the cells tend to grow in multicellular aggregates. Upon adaptation to high osmolarity conditions the cells disaggregate and grow as single cells that lack the methanochondroitin layer. Identification of the Methanosarcinales S-layer Protein The identity of the proteins composing the S-layer of these organisms was subsequently determined by a proteomic approach. The major S-layer proteins of M. acetivorans C2A and M. mazei G√∂1 were determined to be MA0829 and MM1976, respectively. Additional proteins with similar characteristics as MA0829 and MM1976 were found to be present in the cell envelopes of these organisms in minor amounts. The genomes of all Methanosarcina species examined thus far have 4-10 paralogous DUF1608 containing proteins. The major and minor S-layer proteins of M. acetivorans C2A and M. mazei G√∂1 share many common features including: an N-terminal signal peptide, one or two protein domains of the DUF1608 protein family, a negatively charged tether of ~70 amino acids, and a C-terminal transmembrane helix that likely anchors the S-layer to the CM. Analysis of protein sequences has determined that members of the DUF1608 protein family contain 250-300 amino acids and are found only in Archaea. With the exception of two halophilic archaea the DUF1608 domain is exclusive to the methanogenic Archaea of the order Methanosarcinales. The DUF1608 has been assigned to the protein family (Pfam), pfam07752. Structure The structure of the C-terminal DUF1608 domain of the Methanosarcinales S-layer Tile Protein MA0829. A, the C-terminal DUF1608 domain of MA0829 with domain I colored red, domain II in blue, and the connector subdomain in yellow. B, the crystallographic dimer of the MA0829 CTR. C, a trimer of crystallographic CTR homodimers. Ammonium citrate ligands from the crystallization solution bound at intermolecular interfaces are shown in space filling representation. D, the hexagonal tiles formed from trimeric CTR homodimer assemblies. The primary, asymmetric, and trimer pores are indicated. E, a cutaway side view of the model of the MSTP S-layer (the representation in D is rotated 90¬∞ from the viewer). The position of the primary pore is indicated by arrowheads. Adapted from The structure of one of the two tandem DUF1608 repeats that comprise the major MSTP of M. acetivorans (MA0829) has been determined at high resolution by X-ray crystallography. The structure of the C-terminal DUF1608 tandem repeat (CTR) of MA0829 revealed that the DUF1608 protein domain is composed of two structurally similar Œ≤-sandwich domains connected by a short connector subdomain. The Œ≤-sandwich domains are structurally similar not only to each other but also to other proteins associated with envelope structures of disparate species including bacterial, fungal, and viral entities. While the structure of only one of the two DUF1608 domains of the MA0829 protein was determined the structure of the full-length MA0829 tandem DUF1608 repeat protein (minus the N-terminal signal peptide and C-terminal tether and anchor) could be modeled by virtue of the MA0829 CTR forming the same crystallographic dimer in two different crystal forms. The high degree of primary amino acid sequence identity between the N- and C-terminal DUF1608 domains (79% identical and 87% similar) allowed the homology modeling of the N-terminal DUF1608 amino acid sequence onto one of the DUF1608 domains in the crystallographic DUF1608 CTR dimer thus providing the first high-resolution model of an Archaeal S-layer protein. A model for the quaternary structure of the M. acetivorans S-layer was proposed based on packing of the MA0829 CTR in a hexagonal lattice in one of the two obtained crystal forms (Protein Data Bank accession number 3U2G). The minimal building block of the S-layer sheet is a trimer of crystallographic MA0829 CTR dimers. Lateral translation of the trimeric unit creates a flat 2-dimensional sheet that has features consistent with the molecular properties of hexagonal archaeal S-layers. The overall appearance of the S-layer resembles a honeycomb structure of hexagonal tiles with center to center spacing between the tiles of ~240 √Ö and a height of ~45 √Ö. Three different types of pores are present in the sheet with \\"Primary pores\\" situated on the six-fold symmetry axis and \\"Trimer pores\\" on the three-fold symmetry axis. Asymmetric pores are located between the adjacent trimeric building blocks. The size of the pores are sufficiently large to allow the exchange of metabolites between the organism and the external environment. Whereas the protein constituents of lipid-based barriers, such as bacterial outer membranes, can be rapidly modified in response to physiological or environmental stimuli, the large pore sizes of the S-layer composed of MSTP protein subunits are presumably required to allow passage of molecules across a protective barrier whose molecular features are difficult to modify. An interesting feature of the model proposed for the M. acetivorans S-layer is the overwhelmingly negative charge of the surfaces of the S-layer including the pores. The S-layer thus presents a substantial size and charge barrier to the free passage of molecules across the S-layer. The two structures of the MA0829 CTR have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank: 3U2G is the accession code for the selenomethionine-labeled protein in the P622 space group and 3U2H is the accession code for the unlabeled protein structure in the C2 space group. Applications S-layers have many potential biotechnology applications. The use of the high-resolution MA0829 structure to facilitate such studies is complicated by difficulties in reconstituting archaeal S-layers in vitro.

A member of the Country Liberal Party, he was elected to represent the seat of Daly in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly at the 2012 election. After the 2016 election, the CLP was reduced to only two members in the Legislative Assembly, with Higgins becoming party leader and Leader of the Opposition. Following health problems, he resigned both positions in favour of Lia Finocchiaro in February 2020, and retired at the 2020 election. Early life Higgins moved to the Northern Territory in 1986, and was employed in the Territory public service, where he became Director of Corporate Services at the Attorney-General's office. After leaving the public service, he bought the Daly River Mango Farm, a mango orchard and tourist park on the Daly River. Parliament He joined the Giles Ministry in February 2015, becoming Minister for Sport and Recreation, Minister for Senior Territorians, Minister for the Environment, and Minister assisting the Minister for Arts and Museums. CLP leadership The CLP was defeated in a landslide at the 2016 election. Higgins was one of only two CLP candidates to be elected, and the only surviving member of the previous cabinet. Even before it was confirmed that former Chief Minister Adam Giles had lost his own seat, it was announced on 2 September 2016 that Higgins would succeed him as CLP leader, and hence Opposition Leader. The only other CLP member in the legislature, Lia Finocchiaro, became his deputy. Higgins faced the task of rebuilding a party that had just suffered one of the worst defeats of a sitting government at the state or territory level in Australia. Although the CLP had fewer members than the independents, the CLP was recognised as the Official Opposition after the Solicitor-General advised that the five independents could not realistically form an alternative government. Although the CLP was well short of the numbers for official status in the chamber, the new Labor government of Michael Gunner promised that the CLP would be properly resourced as an opposition. As they were the only opposition members of the legislature, Higgins and Finocchiaro divided all shadow portfolios between them. Higgins served as Shadow Treasurer and Shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Infrastructure, Planning and Logistics, Housing and Community Development, Tourism and Culture, Environment and Natural Resources, Public Employment, Corporate and Information Services, Primary Industry and Resources and Northern Australia.Shadow Ministry for 13th Legislative Assembly On 20 January 2020, Higgins announced his resignation as leader of the Country Liberals, citing health problems, and confirmed he will retire from the Legislative Assembly at the next Territory election in August 2020.

It runs from the Azraq oasis in Jordan southeastward into Saudi Arabia, where most of the valley is located. It historically served as a major trade and transportation route between Syria and Arabia. From antiquity until the early 20th century, control of Wadi Sirhan was often contested by various Arab tribes. The valley is called after the Sirhan tribe which migrated there in the mid-17th century. Geography Wadi Sirhan is a wide, enclosed depression that starts in the Azraq oasis in Jordan and runs southeast into Saudi Arabia, ending in the wells of Maybu ø. Its breadth varies . According to the historian Irfan Shahid, \\"the term wƒÅdƒ´, which suggests a narrow passageway, might seem misapplied\\" to Wadi Sirhan, a \\"broad lowland\\". The Czech explorer Alois Musil described it as a \\"sandy, marshy lowland\\" with scattered hillocks. History Wadi Sirhan historically served as an important trade route between Arabia and Syria. The Assyrian king Esarhaddon launched a campaign against the Bazu and Khazu tribes in Wadi Sirhan in the 7th century BCE. =Roman and Byzantine eras= The basin continued to serve as an important route during the Roman era, connecting the Arabia Petraea province with the Arabian Peninsula. Though its strategic value emanated from its role as a gateway for trans-Arabian trade and transportation, Wadi Sirhan was also a significant source of salt. At its northern end, it was guarded by the fortress of Azraq, while its southern end was guarded by the fortress of Dumat al-Jandal. At both forts inscriptions were found indicating the presence of troops from the Bosra-based Legio III Cyrenaica. Wadi Sirhan was the home region from which the Salihids entered Syria and became the principal Arab federates of the Byzantine Empire throughout the 5th century CE. When the Salihids were succeeded by the Ghassanids at the beginning of the 6th century, Wadi Sirhan became dominated by the latter‚Äôs allies, the Banu Kalb. The Ghassanids were charged by the Byzantines with supervision over the region after Emperor Justinian dismantled the Limes Arabicus, a series of garrisoned fortifications guarding the empire‚Äôs eastern desert frontiers, . The Ghassanids and the Kalb essentially supplanted the limes. The Ghassanid phylarch Arethas passed through the depression on his way to defeating the Banu Tamim. Likewise, Alqama, a poet of the latter tribe passed through Wadi Sirhan to meet with Arethas to lobby for his brother‚Äôs release from captivity. =Early Islamic era= Following the Muslim conquest in 634 CE, the basin became an often fought over frontier between the Banu Kalb and their distant kinsmen from the Banu al-Qayn. =Modern era= The lowland gained its current name following the migration of the Sirhan tribe, purported descendants of the Banu Kalb, to the Dumat al- Jandal region from the Hauran . Before their migration, Wadi Sirhan was known as Wadi al-Azraq after the Azraq oasis. T.E. Lawrence referred to the Wadi, during the Arab Revolt, \\"We found the Sirhan not a valley, but a long fault draining the country on each side of it and collecting the waters into the successive depressions of its bed.\\" By the late 19th century, the Ruwalla were the predominant Bedouin tribe of Wadi Sirhan. The emir of the tribe, Nuri Shalan, was a signatory of the Hadda Agreement between the Emirate of Transjordan and the Sultanate of Nejd, the precursors of modern-day Jordan and Saudi Arabia, respectively. The treaty resulted in most of Wadi Sirhan becoming part of Saudi Arabia, while Jordan retained the basin's northwestern corner around Azraq.

Game Play Two teams (one red and one yellow), each consisting of three celebrities in the studio and up to four family members at home, compete against each other to earn points. The team with the highest point score wins the game and a brand new car. =Rounds One through Four= The first four rounds are made up of several different mini-games that are presented in various playing orders. The number of points available is announced at the beginning of each round. =What do you know?= The two teams race on the buzzers to answer. The first team to buzz in and answer correctly earns points. An incorrect answer locks out the team from further clues and gives the opposing team a chance to see the remainder of clues and answer. No penalty for an incorrect answer. There was only one buzzer per team. Team members who buzz in must answer individually and cannot confer with their partners. Questions in this round fit the following categories: * Name That Tune: A song is played in the background of a music video specially made for the show. The contents of the video are also clues to the song‚Äôs title. Guessing the title of the song earns 10 points. * Odd One Out: Five items are listed. Four of the items have something in common and one does not. Guessing the one that does not belong earns 10 points. Who am I? A video is played featuring progressively older photographs and progressively larger descriptive clues given to the identity of a famous person. Guessing the identity of the person earns 10 points. Name That Film A film clip is played featuring progressively larger descriptive clues given to the title of a movie. Guess the title of the film and the team earns 10 points. Home Team Question A film clip and descriptive clue is played. A question and three answer choices about the subject of the clip is asked to the home viewers. The family can confer but only the captain can buzz in and give the answer. The first family to buzz in and answer correctly earns 20 points. An incorrect answer gives the opposing family a chance to answer from the remaining choices. No penalty for an incorrect answer. =Round Two ‚Äì Picture This= Six hidden and numbered pictures appear on the game board. Each member of each team, alternating one at a time, chooses a number. The picture containing part of a subject is revealed. A correct identification is worth 10 points apiece. No penalty for an incorrect guess. Team members can confer with each other, but only the controlling player can guess. =Round Three ‚Äì Who Lives Here?= This round is played one team at a time in three parts. Part One ‚Äì Who Lives Here? The celebrities and home players on one team are shown a video containing the inside and outside contents of the home of a famous celebrity. With the contents as clues, the celebrities must guess the identity of the home‚Äôs owner. Then the home players either agree with the celebrities or make their own guess if they don‚Äôt. If the identity is correct, the team earns 20 points. However, if the home team gave a different identity, and it was correct, the team earned 40 points. Again, there is no penalty for a wrong guess. Part Two ‚Äì Under the Spotlight The celebrities were shown a video containing the celebrity from part one giving answers to fifteen questions, with the questions edited out of the video. Then, the celebrities were given 30 seconds to remember five of the responses mentioned in the video and try to match them to the questions asked. The questions were asked one at a time, and the team can pass if they cannot give an answer. If five responses were correctly matched, the team earned 20 points. The team must match all five responses in order to earn the points. Part Three ‚Äì Would You Believe‚Ä¶ The home players were then shown a video containing the celebrity from part one giving a statement about themselves that may or may not be true. Then, the team decided if the statement was true or false. A correct response earns the team 20 points, with no penalty for an incorrect response. The round was then repeated for the opposing team with a different celebrity. =Round Four ‚Äì Who is This?= This round is played on the buzzers in two parts. Part One ‚Äì Who is This? The home teams are shown electronically pixilated faces of well known celebrities along with a vocal description. As the clues get larger, the picture gets slowly restored. The first member of the first team to buzz in and answers correctly earns 10 points. The first two identities are played by the adults and the third is played by the children. The winner of the third identity also wins a special related prize. Part Two ‚Äì What Happens Next? The celebrities are shown a video that is stopped at a specified point.

No penalty for an incorrect selection. =Round Five ‚Äì Observation= This round is played one team at a time. The celebrities on one team are shown a film clip from a movie or television series. A question is asked to one of the celebrity teammates about something that occurred on the clip. The celebrities cannot confer with each other in this round. After the team member responds, a portion of the clip was repeated revealing the answer. A correct answer earned 20 point. However, an incorrect answer deducted 20 points from the team‚Äôs score. Each team member was asked a different question from left to right. Sometimes all questions are asked by a special guest celebrity appearing in studio or on video that is related to the film clip.

Early life Henry Churchill de Mille was born on a farm at Washington, North Carolina. He was the son of businessman and politician William Edward de Mille (1824‚Äì1873) and Margaret Blount Hoyt de Mille (1835‚Äì1911). He received his BA and AM degrees from Columbia College in 1875 and 1879. He had studied for the ministry before choosing instead to teach and eventually serve as vice-principal at the Lockwood Academy in Brooklyn and later teach for some semesters at the Columbia Grammar School in Manhattan.Henry C. DeMille, Dramatist; New York Times; February 11, 1893 accessed September15, 2012North Carolina Biographical Dictionary; 1999; pg. 168 accessed September 15, 2012 Theatrical career He began in amateur theater and later as an actor with A. M. Palmer's organization before returning to teaching at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. By 1882 de Mille was employed at the Madison Square Theatre reviewing and later revising submitted plays, during which he became acquainted with the playwrights Steele MacKaye and David Belasco. On December 10, 1883, de Mille's first original play, John Delmer's Daughters, or Duty, opened at the Madison Square Theatre and closed a week later. Three years later, on September 18, 1886, Main Line, or Rawson's Y, a Western melodrama written in collaboration with Charles Barnard, opened at the old Lyceum Theatre. The play, a love story set at a remote railroad way station (complete with authentic RR tracks) and telegraph office, received warm opening night reviews.Amusements. New York Times; September 19, 1886; pg. 9 A short while later de Mille would join forces with David Belasco in a collaborative effort that would prove to have a greater box-office appeal with the theatergoing public. Their first production was The Wife, a four-act drama that premiered at the Lyceum Theatre on November 1, 1887, under the direction of Daniel Frohman. The play was well received and at its close both authors were called upon to make their curtain call.The Lyceum Theatre. New York Times; November 2, 1887; pg. 5 Lord Chumley; or the Knight of Lummy Tum a three-act comedy written for E. H. Sothern was well received on August 21, 1888, and their three-act drama, The Charity Ball, another success, debuted at the Lyceum Theatre on November 19, 1889.\\"The Charity Ball\\" At Last. New York Times: November 15, 1889; pg. 5 The following season the two produced Men and Women at the Proctor's Twenty-third Street Theatre. The drama opened on October 20, 1890, and starred Maude Adams in a tale about business and politics in America.Amusements. New York Times; October 22, 1890; pg. 4 Belasco and de Mille chose to go their separate ways by 1891. Later that October de Mille produced The Lost Paradise, his adaptation of the Ludwig Fulda play Das Verlorene Paradies. The production by Charles Frohman's company proved to be another success and was considered to be de Mille's best work to date.The American Magazine, Volume 33; 1892: pg. 442 accessed September 16, 2012 As he was finishing The Lost Paradise, de Mille read Henry George's famous treatise Progress and Poverty and immediately became a dedicated Georgist \\"single-taxer\\". De Mille resolved to write a conclusion to The Lost Paradise called The Promised Land, based on the teachings of George, but de Mille died of typhoid fever less than a year later and before it could be finished. Marriage In 1876 de Mille married Matilda Beatrice \\"Bebe\\" Samuel (1853‚Äì1923), a native of Liverpool who had come to America with her parents when she was about eighteen. Their son William C. deMille was born in 1878, Cecil B. DeMille in 1881 and daughter Agnes de Mille some ten years later.No Intermissions ‚Äì The Life of Agnes de Mille, by Carol Easton, accessed September 16, 2012 Death While at home in Pompton, New Jersey, de Mille contracted pneumonia and died there after a brief struggle on February 10, 1893. He was survived by his wife and children, though his young daughter would fall victim to spinal meningitis just two years later. Two months after de Mille died his widow founded the Henry C. De Mille School for Girls in Pompton and opened an office on Broadway becoming only the second woman playbroker (facilitator) in America working with playwrights, producers and actors. Legacy Today de Mille's legacy probably lies more with what influence he had over his sons. Within a decade or so of his death, de Mille's style of play writing went out of vogue and his works were largely forgotten. His demise at thirty-nine denied him the opportunity to evolve with the times and possibly be as well known today as a few of his contemporaries.

History  Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and Andorran Prime Minister Antoni Mart√≠ at a press conference during Prime Minister Rajoy's visit to Andorra; January 2015. Andorra and Spain have an unusual and long relationship. Andorra was created by Charlemagne as a buffer state between France and the Umayyad conquest of Hispania.BBC: Andorra In 1278, under terms of \\"pareage\\" agreement, Andorra adopted joint allegiance to a French and a Spanish prince after disputes between French heirs to the Urgel countship and the Spanish bishops of Urgell. For more than 700 years Andorra was ruled jointly by the leader of France and the Spanish Bishop of Urgell. During the Spanish Civil War, Andorra received refugees from both sides of the Spanish conflict. During World War II, Andorra became an important smuggling route from Vichy France into neutral Spain. Official diplomatic relations between Andorra and Spain were established after the signing of a joint Treaty of Good Neighborhood, Friendship and Cooperation between Andorra, France and Spain; after Andorra adopted a new constitution establishing them as a parliamentary democracy.Bilateral relations between Spain and Andorra (in Spanish) The Bishop of Urgell acts as a co-Prince (along with the President of France) in Andorra. In 1993, Spain opened a resident embassy in Andorra la Vella.

In January 2015, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy became the first Spanish leader to ever visit Andorra. The visit was a clear example of the good state of bilateral relations. The progressive intensification of bilateral relations between Andorra and Spain progressed with the formal invitation, made in November 2016, by Andorran Present Antoni Mart√≠ for King Felipe VI of Spain to visit the Principality. Spaniards are the largest nationality to visit Andorra for touristic purposes. Spanish citizens are also the largest foreign residents in Andorra with over 18,000 Spanish citizens living in Andorra.Andorra en Xifres (in Spanish) Bilateral agreements Since 1993, both nations have signed several bilateral agreements such as a Treaty of Good Neighborhood, Friendship and Cooperation (1993); Agreement regarding the Statute of the Co-Prince Episcopal (1995); Agreement regarding the entry, circulation, residence and establishment of each nations citizens (2000); Agreement on Social Security (2002); Agreement on reciprocal recognition of hunting weapon authorizations and sports shooting (2005); Agreement in educational matters (2005); Agreement of Collaboration between the General Council of the Judiciary and the Superior Council of Justice (2006); Agreement for the exchange of information on tax matters (2010); Agreement on access to each nation's Universities (2010); Agreement on the transfer of waste (2011); Protocol of collaboration between the Spanish Attorney General of the State and the Andorran President of the Higher Council of Justice to establish a program of exchanges and visits by public prosecutors (2014); Agreement to avoid Double Taxation (2015); Agreement on International Road Transport (2015); Memorandum of understanding, friendship and general cooperation (2015); Agreement between the Spanish General Council of the Judiciary and the Andorran Superior Council of Justice (2015); Convention on combating crime and cooperation in security matters (2015); Memorandum of understanding between the AEMPS and the Ministry of Health of Andorra on Cooperation on medicines, health products and cosmetics (2017); Memorandum of understanding regarding the transfer of people diagnosed with high-risk infectious diseases for treatment in specialized medical centers in Spain (2017); Agreement on the exercise of paid professional activities by dependents of diplomatic, consular, administrative and technical personnel of diplomatic missions, consular offices and permanent representations before international organizations from one state to the other (2017) and a Memorandum of understanding in the field of cybersecurity (2017) Trade In 2017, trade between Andorra and Spain totaled ‚Ç¨835 million Euros.

It was directed by Sanjay Khan. The series was initially shown on the state-run DD Metro, and was later shown on Sony Entertainment Television in 2008. Plot In the Treta Yuga (2nd age), various events occur, including the defeat of demons by Lord Vishnu, which leads to the birth of positive and negative forces. One of the negative forces‚Äîthe rise of demon dictator Ravana‚Äîplunges the universe into terror. The birth of God becomes necessary to eliminate the terror of Ravana, leading to the birth of two of the most powerful and mutually attached gods: Shri Rama and Hanuman, sons of Ayodhya's King Dashrath and the ape-headed King Kesari respectively. As time passes, the two meet and become close friends. Hanuman is a celibate monkey, dedicated friend, and brave warrior. Shri Ram is an ideal human being and an excellent warrior, whose love for Hanuman knows no bounds. Shri Ram asks Hanuman to perform worldly duties until the call of time. As time progresses, events described in Valmiki's Ramayan take place. During the war of Lanka, the war skills of human beings and monkeys (along with those of Shri Rama and Hanuman) lead to the end of demon warriors like Meghnad, Kumbhakarna, and Ravan. Shri Rama ultimately returns to Ayodhya, and Ramarajya comes into existence. As time passes, friendship between Sri Rama and Hanuman grows, but after many dramatic events Shri Rama‚Äîalong with his co- incarnated fellows Laxman, Sita, Shatrughna and Bharat‚Äîleaves Earth. They leave Hanuman alone to serve mankind. As time passes, the Dvapara Yuga (3rd age) arrives and Shri Rama, along with other incarnated souls, reincarnates as Shri Krishna to protect Dharma. Shri Krishna forms an alliance with Pandavas, the five Moral Brothers, against their 100 immoral cousins, the Kauravas. The third Pandava, Arjuna, is a friend and follower of Krishna. Shri Krishna makes Hanuman realise that he and his friend Shri Rama are the same, and asks him to support him in his mission Hanuman does so, and the events of Mahabharata take place. Before the war, Pandavas (on the advice of Shri Krishna) invokes Hanuman to help him in the upcoming war. Hanuman blesses them and takes a place in Arjuna's Chariot. The sermon of Bhagavad Geeta and the 18 Days Battle of Kurukshetra take place, leading to a victory for Dharma. Hanuman watches the bloodshed in silence. After many other dramatic events, the Dvapara Yuga ends and Shri Krishna leaves Earth. As time passes, the Kali Yuga (4th age) arrives and all morality from Earth fades away. Hanuman takes the responsibility of sowing the seeds of Dharma along with spreading the fame of Sri Rama with the help of Goswami Tulsidas, who is the incarnation of Maharishi Valmiki. Goswami Tulsidas rewrites the Ramayana in the form of the Ramcharitmanas to help uplift the masses. Hanuman helps Goswami Tulsidas in every way, including helping to fade of the illusion of lust. Goswami Tulsidas and Hanuman are successful to some extent in their mission. Tulsidas pleases Shri Rama and Lakshman and they give their Darshan, while Sita gives Darshan to Ratna, his wife.

There were other kinds of special tobacco for relatives of the emperor and members of the Imperial Household. The production of the former came to an end in 1945. The production of Onshino Tabako finally ceased at the end of 2006, the last producer being the Japan Tobacco Company. History The exact origin of Onshino Tabako with the crest of the Imperial House of Japan, with the 16 petals of the chrysanthemum, is unknown; what is known is that Onshino Tabako had been in existence since the Meiji era. The Empress to the Emperor Meiji presented wounded soldiers at the 1877 Satsuma Rebellion with Onshino Tabako as gifts, according to formal records. During the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the cigarettes were produced by Iwaya Shokai Company.JACAR Ref. C060833600, Ministry of Self Defense, Institute of DefenseJACAR Ref. 06060996200, Ministry of Self Defense, Institute of Defense The formal Onshino Tabako system was started in 1933. During the war years it was included in the supplies of the army and navy, each order prepared by hand. The special cigarettes were even mentioned in a war song called \\"Sorano Y≈´shi\\" (Brave Men of the Skies) in 1939 which portrayed the Battles of Khalkhin Gol. On the packaging of Onshino Tabako was printed a character: Ë≥ú, meaning \\"gift from a noble man,\\" and the chrysanthemum crest was on every cigarette. The taste of Onshino Tabako was reportedly the same as other cigarettes. According to some men who had tasted it, it was bitter, as opposed to sweet. It was not sold on the market, and was exclusively given to decorated persons, attendants at Imperial parties, visitors to and volunteers of Imperial House of Japan, and security men of the Imperial Household. On June 25, 1959, it was presented to every member of the Tokyo Giants and Osaka Tigers, professional baseball teams which played before Hirohito. Because of recent health finds that confirm that tobacco smoking is dangerous to one's health, Onshino Tabako was discontinued at the end of 2006. In its place, Onshino Kompeit≈ç, a candy, is often presented. According to the records of the National Diet, it was the same as Asahi Cigarettes (30 yen per 20 cigarettes; in 2010, it was 20 yen.). There had been another kind of tobacco for the guests of the Imperial Household Agency and Imperial relatives, and it had the crest of chrysanthemum with 14 petals, as opposed to formal 16.  Terminology of Imperial Household-related tobacco  *The Gory≈ç tobacco: tobacco for the Emperor, the Empress and the Empress Dowager. Its production started in 1873 by Sotoike Shozaburo (the name of the store was Yanagiya). The contract went to the Tobacco Monopoly Bureau in 1904, which started the production of tobacco for Emperor Meiji the same year and for the Empress in the fiscal 1906 year. At first, the leaves of tobacco were those stored in traditional houses since the Kanbun era (1661 - 1672) and other eras to Kansei era (1789 - 1800); since 1908, excellent tobacco producers and places had been selected, and the leaves were dried and stored at least for several years. The leaves were Kokubu (the name of place), Izumi, Tarumizu, Ibusuki, Maru, Mizufu, Taino and Kirigasa leaves. The last was used to soften the taste. All were excellent leaves in color, dryness and preparation. :Gory≈ç tobacco had been produced with extreme supervision and with alcohol disinfection. The workers had been severely checked for health and behaviour. Gory≈ç tobacco for Emperor Meiji were turned into cigarettes, one sun (1.195 in), 0.7 sun and 0.6 sun in lengths, with the chrysanthemum mark only in the one sun cigarettes. Twenty cigarettes were included in a pack; one paulownia box contained 100 cigarettes. Goryo tobacco for Emperor Taisho contained not only one sun-length cigarettes but also cigars (Turkey, Havana, and Turkey-Havana cigars: a box contained 25 cigars). Goryo cigars were produced for the Empress Meiji. In 1908, they were 2 sun and 4 bu (2.86 in) and 7 sun 5 rin (0.895 in) diameter. The Empress Meiji was a smoker but never smoked in front of Emperor Meiji. *The Specially manufactured tobacco: There were two kinds of special tobacco; one for the Board of the Crown Prince and the empress and houses of princes (relatives of the emperor) and the other for gifts of the Imperial Household Agency. The houses of princes included the Houses of Princes Arisugawa, Kitashirakawa, Kayo, Kuni and others, and cigarettes were produced respectively for them. The production of special tobacco for the relatives of the emperor came to an end in 1945 on the order of the General Headquarters of the allied forces. :The quality of this tobacco was excellent, being of the level of Fuji (name of cigarettes), in fiscal 1918, the production of it with the quality of Asahi and in the fiscal 1920, the production of the level of Shikishima. Since 1914, the chrysanthemum mark had been printed in the center of cigarettes in order to prevent the mark from being stepped on. In the war years, the production of gift tobacco increased, reaching a peak of 28,656,000 cigarettes in the fiscal 1944 year. Asian with conventional leaves were used, and cigars were also produced which contained Havana leaves. Most of the cigarettes were the special cigarettes, 100 cigarettes to a box, while the cigarettes for the Household Agency came in packs of 100, 50, 20, ten and five cigarettes. Twenty-five cigars were included in a small box. Package When they were first produced, the characters \\"Onshi / ÊÅ©Ë≥ú\\" were printed in gold on the package, and it was formally called Special Product No. 1. When the war situation grew darker, gold characters were replaced with black one, and then trimmed to one character, Ë≥ú. This package remained as such during the postwar years. Imperial tobacco box of the latter period In 1982, packages were made for ten, 20, 50, and 100 cigarettes. The tobacco for the Imperial Household Agency was called Special Tobacco No. 2 and contained the chrysanthemum crest on a white background. Since 1968, the 14 petal chrysanthemum package, Special Tobacco No. 3 was produced for the relatives of the emperor. History of Onshino Tabako Between 1883 and 1904, Yanagiya at Nipponbashi produced shredded tobacco and since 1894, cigarettes. In 1894, the Iwaya Shokai was given permission to produce the Onshino Tabako which were given out to soldiers participating in the Sino-Japanese War.Eiji Oshita Eruneosu Eruneosu Shuppansha, 2001, p. 6, 62-6 In 1904, its production went to the Tobacco Monopoly Agency. The production line of Iwaya Shokai went to the Tokyo First Tobacco Production Place, and in the same year, Imperial tobacco began to be produced not only exclusively for noblemen, such as Emperor Taisho and his relatives, but also for its original purposes. Imperial tobacco was made from special leaves of tobacco, while the Special tobacco for noblemen and gifts was made from the finest Fuji leaf or ‰∏ç‰∫å; these were also produced with the utmost care manually. Emperor Taisho was a smoker and smoked his exclusively produced cigarettes, while Hirohito did not; the production of Imperial tobacco, however, continued. The production of special tobacco for the relatives of the Emperor Hirohito was discontinued by the order of the General Headquarters of Japan of the allied forces in 1945. However, Onshino Tobako as gifts continued to be produced. Factories and production All Onshino Tabako were produced in several factories in the Tokyo Prefecture. Before 1945, no other persons were permitted to enter the production room, while workers were fastidiously checked for health. In 1973, six or seven veteran workers produced it, making all the tobacco and packaging it by hand. During the Pacific War, the yearly production amounted to 1 to 2 million cigarettes, and between 1945 and 1965, less than 100,000 cigarettes. Since 1968, cigarettes with filter tips began to be produced, about 300,000 cigarettes yearly. Onshino Cigars Not only cigarettes, but also cigars were produced which had a decorated ring chrysanthemum crest, with 25 to each small wooden box. The leaves were produced in Sumatra and Havana. The production of cigars started in 1939, while the exclusive cigars for Emperor Taisho started earlier in 1917. In 1945, 4,000 cigars were produced. This was peak production. Between 1945 and 1982, an average of 2,500 cigars were produced.

History The castle square goes probably back to a Roman watchtower on the Isar river. The high medieval castle of the 12th century was documented as a possession of the counts of Andechs. In 1293 it came into the possession of the Wittelsbach. Louis II, Duke of Bavaria acquired at that time the possession of the fortress from Ulrich Vellenberg, a ministeriales of the Counts of Andechs. The castle served then also as a residence for his consort Matilda of Habsburg. The present building dates mainly from the late 15th century, when the castle was renovated to celebrate the wedding of Albert IV, Duke of Bavaria with Kunigunde of Austria, a daughter of emperor Frederick III. The construction work was carried out 1486‚Äì87 under the direction of the foreman J√∂rg Weikertshausen. Louis X, Duke of Bavaria was born here in 1495. With the Gr√ºnwald Conference, which took place in February 1522 at the castle, an event in the Gr√ºnwalder history gained European significance. At this conference, the two co-governing dukes, William IV and Ludwig X agreed that Bavaria should continue to belong to the \\"old faith\\", but that the church should be reformed. This decision is today understood as the beginning of the Counter-Reformation in Bavaria, the empire and also the Habsburg lands and had effects that should shape the history of Europe over the next centuries. From the 17th century onwards the castle was used as a ducal hunting lodge, prison and powder magazine. Gr√ºnwald Castle, Donjon In 1872 the castle was sold into private hands. A project for a luxury condominium was prevented by a citizens' initiative which finally led to the purchase of the castle by the Free State of Bavaria in 1976. Since 1979 the Castle houses the Museum Gr√ºnwald, a branch of the Bavarian State Archaeological Collection. The castle can be visited, the main tower offers a worthwhile view. Large parts of the castle were demolished in the 17th and 18th century because the Isar River had undermined the castle hill. At that time the late-Gothic residential quarters of the castle with their rich interior and the chapel of St. George were lost. The early modern state is still delivered on a fresco in the Antiquarium in the Munich Residenz. Since the partial demolition the fortress is an irregular rectangle plant, which is protected by a kennel with a round tower and a deep moat and a gate tower with a renewed cycle of coat of arms. In the north-east corner stands a donjon, a high, square tower. In between lies the elongated three-storey east wing. The north west corner is dominated by the embattled so-called little tower. The adjoining west wing consists of three different levels. The deep fountain in the courtyard which is lined with tufa stone still goes back to the Middle Ages.

First employed on the company's Narvik-Trondheim route, she was transferred to the longer Hurtigruten route in late 1936. Seized by the Germans following their April 1940 attack on Norway, she was used as covert troop ship and was sunk shortly after delivering her cargo of German troops behind Allied lines on 10 May 1940. Construction Nordnorge was ordered by Ofotens Dampskibsselskap to serve the company's Narvik-Trondheim route. She was built at Trondhjems mekaniske V√¶rksted in Trondheim, Norway. She was laid down in September 1922 with yard number 186, and was originally intended to be called Solstr√•len, although the name was changed before launch. She was launched on 12 September 1923, and completed on 17 January 1924, being delivered to her owners the next day.Bakka 2003, p. 95Svanberg 1990, p. 265 Nordnorge was considered a beautiful vessel, and was one of the last of the traditional coastal cargo liners to be built in Norway. As built she had a tonnage of 873 gross register tons or 448 net register tons, a length on , a depth of and a beam of . Her 1,000 indicated horsepower triple expansion steam engine propelled her at . She was built with a promenade deck above the main deck, and was divided into three classes. The First Class section was aft, Second Class amidships and Third Class in the bow area. Nordnorge was licensed to carry 270 passengers in coastal traffic. Early coastal service For the first 12 years of her existence, Nordnorge sailed between Trondheim and Narvik. She would depart Trondheim at 12:00 on Tuesdays and carry passengers and cargo to the coastal towns on her way north to Narvik and back again. She corresponded with Troms Fylkes Dampskibsselskap's L√∏dingen-Troms√∏ route. Until the delivery of Nordnorge, the Trondheim-Narvik route had been served by the older and slower steamer , without the call in L√∏dingen. In 1930 she was assigned the code letters LDHR. By 1934 these had changed to LENR, and remained so until at least 1939. Rebuild and Hurtigruten service In the fall of 1935 Ofotens Dampskibsselskap began negotiations with the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications with the intent on taking part in the expansion of the coastal Hurtigruten service along the Norwegian coast. The negotiations were concluded successfully on 1 November 1936, with Ofotens Dampskibsselskap gaining a contract and Narvik being included in the Hurtigruten route. Nordnorge was designated as the company's ship on Hurtigruten service. Compared to the other companies ships on the service, she was both small and slow. Nordnorge was the only of the ships on the Hurtigruten service to retain the old three-class system, with all the other ships having dispensed of the Second Class.Svanberg 1990, p. 282 During 1936 Nordnorge was rebuilt at Trondhjems mekaniske V√¶rksted. She had her hull extended by , making her a 991 gross register ton/556 net register ton ship. The Third Class section was moved amidships and expanded, and a refrigerated cargo room was added. The bridge was moved up one deck. Nordnorge was fitted with an echo sounder, an electric logbook and radio telephone. Nordnorge departed Bergen on her first Hurtigruten voyage to Kirkenes on 3 November 1936. When she was introduced into the service, the build-up of the Hurtigruten was complete, with daily departures from all the ports of the route. Second World War Following the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Nordnorge continued to sail the coast of Norway. On 13 December 1939 she rescued a survivor from the British steamer , which had been torpedoed and sunk by the German U-boat . The Norwegian patrol boat rescued a further four survivors from the sunken steamer's 36-man crew. =Invasion and mothballing= When Nazi Germany invaded Norway on 9 April 1940, initiating the 62-day Norwegian Campaign, Nordnorge was in dry dock undergoing the final day of her annual maintenance work. During her maintenance period, one of the company's smaller steamers, , stood in for her on the Hurtigruten service. She was supposed to re-enter service on 10 April, an event which was postponed due to the German invasion. Instead Nordnorge was mothballed at Nyhavna in Trondheim. =Operation Wildente and loss= On 7 May 1940 the German occupiers of Trondheim confiscated Nordnorge and replaced her Norwegian crew with Kriegsmarine personnel from the destroyers and . Late in the evening of 9 May the ship sailed northwards from Nyhavna under Norwegian flag, carrying a 300-strong force consisting of a company of mostly Austrian Gebirgsj√§ger troops from the 138 Mountain Regiment of the 2nd Mountain Division, reinforced with a heavy mortar platoon and two mountain guns. The troops and their equipment had been loaded at Muruvik near Hell. In Operation Wildente, the Germans aimed at using the Norwegian coastal steamer to bring their own troops the to Hemnesberget, well behind the Allied lines which were south of Mo i Rana. A successful operation would break up the Allied defence line in Nordland county and cut off Norwegian and British forces, leaving the way north open for the advancing Germans, which at that point were struggling to move forward in the Mosj√∏en area. The operation had originally been initiated on 8 May, but had been recalled after reports of Allied submarine activity in the area. While Hauptmann Anton Holzinger led the operation, Kapitanleutnant Ernst Vogelsang captained Nordnorge during the voyage north.Finnbakk 1995, p. 10Finnbakk 1995, p. 11Lunde 2009, pp. 388‚Äì389Haarr 2010, p. 282Hauge 1995, p. 123 The Germans had armed Nordnorge with two 20 mm automatic cannon and two machine guns, mounted respectively at the bridge and at the bow of the ship.Hauge 1995, p. 124 At 09:50 on 10 May, the Norwegian military in Mosj√∏en was alerted that Nordnorge was sailing north, escorted by two German aircraft. The report, from observers in R√∏rvik, was forwarded to the British military, who after some initial hesitation, at 11:55 ordered the cruiser and the destroyer to intercept and sink Nordnorge. Delayed by German air raids on the Royal Navy base in Skjelfjord in Lofoten, the British warships only got under way at 15:00, too late to intercept Nordnorge. Nordnorge was spotted again at 12:00, by a Norwegian observation post as she passed Lyngv√¶r. The post transmitted their sighting to the military communications central in Bod√∏.Skogheim 1990, pp. 73, 76 As it was uncertain where Nordnorge was headed, Norwegian militia and army units were alerted along the coast of H√•logaland.Sandvik 1965, p. 85 Nordnorge arrived at Hemnesberget at 18:30 on 10 May 1940, after a 40-hour journey. Flying the German war flag only at the last minute, the German troops on board stormed the town. As Nordnorge approached the main quay in Hemnesberget, No. 3 Platoon of No. 1 Independent Company and some 120 Norwegian landvern troops (of Infantry Regiment 14) opened small arms fire at the ship from covered positions. After getting a hawser ashore, German soldiers attacked across the quay, engaging in close house-to-house fighting. During the fighting three German bombers attacked the town. After an hour of fighting the British and Norwegian troops pulled away from the area. Following the capture of Hemnesberget, Nordnorge was unloaded of ammunition and supplies, and Allied and German dead and wounded brought on board.Steen 1958, pp. 180-181Haarr 2010, p. 283 As part of Operation Wildente, German troops were also landed by Dornier seaplanes at nearby Sund.Sandvik 1965, p. 87 The fighting in Hemnesberget cost the lives of five German and eight British soldiers, as well as two Norwegian civilians.Sandvik 1965, p. 90 In his contribution to the major work on Norway and the Second World War Norges Krig 1940‚Äì1945 in 1947, Norwegian Major General Ragnvald Roscher Nielsen called Operation Wildente \\"as audacious as the original invasion\\".Derry 1952, p. 180 At 20:15, Calcutta and Zulu finally reached Hemnesberget. Nordnorge was immediately sunk by gunfire and two torpedoes. The ship exploded and sank stern first in deep water. As she went down, Nordnorge capsized and tore down the quay to which she was moored. The ammunition that had been unloaded on the quay was hit by gunfire and exploded.Finnbakk 1995, p. 12 Sixteen houses were destroyed in the British shelling of Hemnesberget, and one Norwegian civilian was killed.Sandvik 1965, p. 91 Several of the wounded on board Nordnorge perished when she sank.Lunde 2009, p. 390 As Calcutta and Zulu left the scene, they sank the small Norwegian steamer .Pettersen 1992, p. 38 Before Nordnorge was sunk, the Germans had managed to unload the two mountain guns, while the other supplies lost in the sinking were replaced the next day by seaplanes.Derry 1952, p. 181 The dock area in Hemnesberget after the fighting in May 1940 The German capture of Hemnesberget was followed by an unsuccessful Norwegian counter-attack from nearby Finneid on 11 May. During the initial advance of the counter-attack the Norwegian forces captured three of the German naval personnel who had manned Nordnorge, before being pushed back. On 13 May the British and Norwegian forces in the area retreated northwards. The Germans continued their advance on 14 May, while two Royal Navy ships bombarded Hemnesberget the same day, destroying around 160 houses.Sandvik 1965, pp. 91‚Äì96Hauge 1995, p. 125Derry 1952, p. 182 Following the success of Operation Wildente, the Germans made another attempt at bypassing the Allied front lines in Nordland. On 19 May the German-manned cargo ship attempted to bring supplies to the German forces advancing in Nordland. When Albion was spotted by Norwegian lookouts early on in her voyage, she was intercepted and sunk by the Norwegian warships and .Skogheim 1984, p. 230 Aftermath Having suffered the loss of Nordnorge, Ofotens Dampskibsselskap continued to use Bar√∏y on her route.

History Masami Sato, a founder of B1G1, was running a food production company in Australia when she and other entrepreneurs came up with the initial idea of B1G1 in a business program that was facilitated by Paul Dunn who eventually became the Chairman of B1G1.Dunn,Wow and Woow 2010 The team of B1G1 imagined a world where every business transaction made a difference through the simple concept, 'Buy one. Give one.' Whereas major companies use Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as a tool to offset their negative social and environmental impact and establish a better brand image, Sato suggested concentrating on habitual giving through creating meaningful impacts and a deeper sense of connection around the everyday business activities. The co-founders of B1G1 established the headquarters of Buy1GIVE1 PTE LTD in Singapore in 2007. Buy1GIVE1 Buy1GIVE1 (B1G1) is a global business giving initiative launched in 2007 in Singapore. It is a social enterprise, composed of a for-profit corporation, Buy1GIVE1 LTD, and a registered Society, B1G1 Giving. It provides a program with a specific transaction-based giving model to SMEs around the world. In B1G1's program, 100% of contributions made by B1G1 Business clients are directly passed to its partner Non-profit organizations(NGOs). B1G1 focuses on the impact of giving on people's lives rather than simply amounts donated. B1G1's programs emphasize giving habitually in order to create growing impacts around the world. B1G1 is funded by the membership subscription from the B1G1 Business Members and Partners. Membership B1G1 works with small and medium enterprises (SMEs) around the world. Through either yearly Membership or Partnership they make it possible for B1G1 to be a fully sustainable enterprise. Many of the members are currently from Australia, United Kingdom, and New Zealand. B1G1 business members 'link' their sales to multiple projects around the world. Some of the members are Minimonos, Logistics Bureau, Xero, and Thavibu Gallery. B1G1 Worthy Causes B1G1 Worthy Causes are the NGOs that provide specific projects to B1G1. In September 2012, B1G1's website listed approximately 600 projects from around the world.

He was known for his contributions to Czech animated film and Czech, British and Japanese puppet film, cartoon animation and theatre during the 20th century. Early life and education ≈†tƒõp√°nek was born in Libƒçice nad Vltavou. He graduated at the Grammar school of Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k in Kralupy nad Vltavou. In 1950 he graduated from DAMU, department of theatre design in Prague. He studied also under the painter and graphic artist Franti≈°ek Tich√Ω. He studied at the Philosophical Faculty of Charles University in Prague, department of Art History, but did not graduate.  Career  ≈†tƒõp√°nek worked for the Prague theatres, drawing and creating puppet animations in the 1950s. In 1962 he created a puppet animation for the short film Small but Mine ( Mal√© ale moje), and special effects with stretchable puppets for the film 40 Granddads (ƒåty≈ôicet dƒõdeƒçk≈Ø) Throughout the 1970s ≈†tƒõp√°nek worked at Kr√°tk√Ω Film Praha studio, creating many film projects with B≈ôetislav Pojar and Ji≈ô√≠ ≈†alamoun.\\"Le cin√©ma d‚Äôanimation tch√®que √† l‚Äôhonneur aussi du Festival de La Rochelle Guillaume Narguet\\". Radio Prague, 1 July 2014 His contribution to these films was uncredited until 2002, when he won the Andrej Stankoviƒç Prize for best Czech film annual achievement for this work. One of the better known works from this time is an animated series about two bears, Hey Mister, Let's Play!,\\"MIROSLAV ≈†TƒöP√ÅNEK\\", Reflex, 2007, issue 33 for which ≈†tƒõp√°nek was the primary creative artist, working with animator Boris Masn√≠k. His colleague B≈ôetislav Pojar directed the first three episodes; later episodes were directed by ≈†tƒõp√°nek with long distance telephone collaboration from Canada by Pojar, who returned in time to direct the final two episodes. Other projects in which he was involved are the politically charged What the Warm Didn't Know (Co ≈æ√≠≈æala nevƒõdƒõla) and Appletree Virgin (Jablo≈àov√° panna). ≈†tƒõp√°nek maintained a workshop under the T√Ωn in Prague, while commuting to his work at the studio Brat≈ôi v triku for many years. He was the author and director of the short film The Shooting Gallery (C.K. St≈ôelnice) in 1969, for the studio Kr√°tk√Ω Film among others, it was awarded the Chicago Silver Hugo and was sold for American university distribution. ≈†tƒõp√°nek's meticulous working style at times slowed down production at the studio. In the mid-1970s, work on the serialized adaptation of Ji≈ô√≠ Trnka's book The Garden (Zahrada), again with Pojar's direction and ≈†tƒõp√°nek's puppets and art, stalled because of the complex set and technical equipment, and only five episodes were filmed, although the authors had contracts for additional episodes. Pojar and ≈†tƒõp√°nek worked together on a film production of The Garden, which was left unfinished after changes were made by the studio administration. Between 1977 and 1979 the three made films about D√°≈°e≈àka for the children's program Veƒçern√≠ƒçek, on Czechoslovak Television. After this ≈†tƒõp√°nek ended his work with Pojar, partly over disagreement about the credits for the series Hey Mister, Let's Play!. ≈†tƒõp√°nek made animated films with other directors, including V√°clav Bed≈ôich and Ji≈ô√≠ Brdeƒçka. The Czech art historian Ji≈ô√≠ ≈†etlik in a review of Brdeƒçka's film Revange (Pomsta, 1968) praised ≈†tƒõp√°nek's art direction as well as the story, camerawork and editing. With cartoonist V√°clav Bed≈ôich, ≈†tƒõp√°nek created an adaptation of the feature parodies made by director Old≈ôich Lipsk√Ω. These included three films about the fate of Kamen√°ƒç Bill and the series Deadly Scent (Smrtic√≠ v≈Ønƒõ) by Bed≈ôich. The Italian production company Corona Cinematografica Roma in collaboration with Kr√°tk√Ω Film in 1973 co-produced a Czech folk fairy-tale. ≈†tƒõp√°nek chose Erben's Jablo≈àov√° panna and in the workshops of the Kr√°tk√Ω studio created Trnka-esque gothic-style puppets and scenery, to illustrate the climate of Czechoslovakia under the occupying forces. ≈†tƒõp√°nek worked for two years at the studio Kr√°tk√Ω Film on the film project The Pied Piper, with more than sixty puppets, and many backgrounds. Although the German co-producer of the project TV 2000 Film- und Fernsehproduktions contracted for ≈†tƒõp√°nek's work, the post-1968 management of the studio did not allow him to complete this project; the film was completed using other puppets by Ji≈ô√≠ Barta. ≈†tƒõp√°nek subsequently mounted a few smaller exhibits, including one at the Mlad√° Fronta Gallery in 1985 and at the Castle in Roztoky u Prahy in 1988. During the first half of the 1990s ≈†tƒõp√°nek entered into a legal battle with Kr√°tk√Ω Film concerning the films made jointly by ≈†tƒõp√°nek and Pojar; among other things he requested a correction of the credit titles in the filmed copies of the serial about bears; in the original television cycle and in the later serial of the same name directed by Jana H√°dkov√°, ≈†tƒõp√°nek's name was rarely mentioned. Subsequently, a version of Hey Mister, Let's Play! giving ≈†tƒõp√°nek credit as creative artist and director was circulated in both Czech cinema and television channels. Eventually, after intervention by the organization for the protection of authors, the masters of the serial Pojƒète pane budeme si hr√°t TV tapes were corrected. In June 2005 ≈†tƒõp√°nek received the \\"Andrej \\"Nikolaj\\" Stankoviƒç Prize\\". for cinematography for his lifelong work and contribution to the Czech film industry. In 2005 the Summer Film School at Uhersk√© Hradi≈°tƒõ, Czech Republic, presented retrospectives showing films by Pojar and ≈†tƒõp√°nek, and printed supplementary information about both authors in its catalogue. ≈†tƒõp√°nek died on 28 November 2005, in Prague.

Family  Arnold Timmermann, Karl's grandfather, emigrated from Altenmarhorst/Twistringen, Germany to Cuming County, Nebraska in 1871. By 1881, Arnold's parents (John Henry and Helena Dames), a brother (John Henry) and a sister (Anna) also arrived in Pebble Creek Valley, north of the village of Dodge. Arnold married Anna Wortman July 6, 1876, in West Point. John, Karl's father, was born on July 28, 1876. He enlisted in the U.S. Army on April 9, 1919, and became part of Company M of the Eighth Infantry in the American Army of Occupation. While absent without leave in 1921, John met Maria Weisbecker. They married, and in Frankfurt, had a son who they named Hans Karl Heinrich on June 19, 1922. By January 1924, they were in Nebraska. On August 16, 1928, John was discharged from the U.S. Army. Karl attended the Guardian Angels School in West Point, Nebraska. His interest in military history led him to participate in the Citizens Military Training Camps for two summers before his senior year of high school. He graduated in 1940. \\"Young Karl\\" was concerned about being German with a growing war in Europe. He also had been exposed to taunts regarding his father's \\"cowardice,\\" desertion from the military, and disgracing of the Timmermann family name. This feeling caused him to express, \\"... I'm going to make it right again.\\" Three other siblings and a brother-in-law eventually joined the U.S. military \\"to redeem their name\\".  Military service  On July 6, 1940, Karl Timmermann enlisted in the U.S. Army. He was stationed at Fort Lewis, Washington and assigned to the 15th Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Infantry Division. After the Japanese military attacked Pearl Harbor, his unit began training for war. The 3rd Infantry Division, with the 41st Infantry Division, were then part of IX Corps. In May 1941, the two divisions moved to the Hunter Liggett Military Reservation where June war games pitted them against Major General Joseph Stilwell's 7th Division and the 40th Division. Large scale maneuvers continued in August on the Olympic Peninsula, with IX Corps defending Tacoma, Washington until the two divisions from California could arrive to assist. In October 1942, the 3rd Infantry Division headed for Norfolk, Virginia, then sailed for Morocco and Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa. Timmermann did not go with them, as he had been noted for his leadership ability and was selected for Officer Candidate School. He became a second lieutenant on February 16, 1943 at Fort Benning, Georgia. He was sent to Fort Riley, Kansas for armored infantry training, and was assigned as a platoon leader in Company A (\\"Able\\") of the 27th Armored Infantry Battalion, 9th Armored Division.The 52nd Infantry Regiment (United States) had been redesignated on July 15, 1942, as the 52nd Armored Infantry Regiment, assigned to the 9th Armored Division, and activated at Fort Riley, Kansas. This regiment was broken up October 9, 1943, at Camp Young and its elements reorganized and redesignated as elements of the 9th Armored Division as follows: # HHC, 52nd Armored Infantry Regiment (less 1st, 2d, and 3d Battalions) as the 52nd Armored Infantry Battalion. # 1st Battalion as the 60th Armored Infantry Battalion. # 2nd Battalion as the 27th Armored Infantry Battalion. # 3rd Battalion disbanded, with the assets and personnel being mostly assumed by the 52nd Armored Infantry Battalion. * Reference: Due to his length of service, he was given a furlough home. During this leave, he became \\"acquainted\\" with LaVera Meyer. Timmermann proposed to her by letter with an enclosed ring, and she accepted by mail. On May 25, 1944, the couple was married in Omaha, Nebraska. On August 20, 1944, the 27th Armored Infantry Battalion boarded the RMS Queen Mary, which arrived in Scotland on August 27. On September 28, Timmermann and his division arrived in France. The untested troops were placed in the Ardennes sector in Belgium. It was considered a quiet sector, good for green troops. In early December 1944, Karl met his brother Fritz, who was serving in an engineer battalion. On December 16, 1944, the Germans started their offensive that became known to the Americans as the Battle of the Bulge. Timmermann, as a junior officer, was in the thick of the fighting near St. Vith with his platoon. His company's entire kitchen staff and supply sergeant were captured and later executed by the German SS troops in what became known as the Malmedy massacre. Timmermann was wounded in the arm by shell fragments during the fighting, but stayed with his unit until relieved. The Germans twice announced that the 9th Armored Division had been destroyed during the battle, but it fought on, earning the nickname \\"Phantom Division\\". In late February 1945, Timmermann and the 9th Armored Division were supporting the right flank (or southern portion) of British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery's forces. On February 28, Timmermann's daughter Gay Diane was born, but he did not learn of her birth for almost two weeks. On March 6, Timmermann's company commander was wounded in action and Timmermann was appointed by Lieutenant Colonel Leonard Engeman to take over Able company. He was also told that Able company was going to be the advance guard for a push to the Rhine River. = Battle for Ludendorff Bridge = At 1340 hours on March 7, 1945, the main American attack began on Remagen. As the Americans fought their way to the western (or left) edge of the bridge, the Germans set off explosives, creating a 10-meter wide crater in the ramp of the bridge. At 1500 hours, the Americans paused, waiting for the bridge to be demolished by the Germans, but nothing happened. Unbeknownst to the Americans, the Germans had already tried to destroy the bridge several times, and under fire were struggling to repair the demolition wires to blow up the bridge. Finally, the Americans decided to take the bridge, and the order went out. At about 1530 hours, Timmermann was ordered to assault the bridge with his company in an effort to seize and hold it intact. Within five minutes, Timmermann was leading his under-strength company onto the bridge. Timmermann had designated half of his men to rush directly to the other side of the bridge to secure the east side and provide covering fire to the rest of the men. The other half swarmed the bridge, dodging machine gun fire, moving from girder to girder, and cutting wires and removing as many of the explosive charges as possible. As Timmermann's men were approaching mid-span at 1540 hours, the eastern portion of the bridge was blown up by order of German Major Hans Scheller, but somehow remained standing; the bridge span had lifted slightly, and then dropped safely back into place. Timmermann and his men picked themselves up, continuing to cut wires and dump explosives into the water, while the other half continued their attack across the bridge. American engineers arrived and were ordered to take over removing demolition charges from the bridge. After being replaced by the engineers, the rest of Timmermann's men followed the first half of the company eastward across the Rhine. At about 1545 hours, one of Timmermann's squad leaders, Sergeant Alexander A. Drabik of Holland, Ohio, was the first American soldier to cross the bridge. Drabik ran the entire bridge with his squad through the settling dust and smoke from the explosion at the eastern end, without having a single soldier wounded or killed.\\"First GI to Cross Rhine Unterrified By Lorelei Maiden\\", Stars & Stripes London Edition, 1945‚Äì03‚Äì12 p. 1. Drabik later said: By about 1600 hours, Timmermann was isolated on the eastern side of the bridge. Friendly forces were trying to fill in the crater on the western side, while engineers were removing the last of the explosives. Other infantry units were moving up, but were being harassed by anti-aircraft weapons covering the western side of the bridge. Timmermann ordered some of his men up around the Erpeler Ley, a large hill just beyond the eastern end of the bridge, to destroy the weapons. The Germans abandoned their weapons and retreated. Timmermann's other men raced over the hill to cover the end of the railroad tunnel under the Erpeler Ley to prevent any enemy from reinforcing the Germans there. Within thirty minutes, these tasks were accomplished. Timmermann had 15 men with him in two shell craters and was waiting for reinforcements. Unknown to Timmermann, about 300 German soldiers and civilians were hiding within the 325-meter long tunnel. In addition, they had four freight train cars loaded with ammunition and aircraft fuel. After a few attempts to escape, the Germans realized they were trapped. The German officers had orders to resist to the last man, but the soldiers became resigned to their fate, as did the civilians. Two German youths who had been enlisted as helpers for the anti-aircraft cannons, came forward out of the tunnel.Ludendorff-Bridge ... \\"The Bridge of Remagen\\"The Bridge of Remagen: Between Truth and Legend March 1945 The first, named Willi Felten, yelled that they were surrendering and moved to the tunnel entrance; he was killed by a shot to the stomach. Another youth, named Karl Busch, stepped forward when a woman asked him to try to talk to the Americans. Busch knew some English from school and remembered a war film where the actor Ren√© Deltgen yelled \\"Stop firing\\" over and over to end the fighting. Young Busch cautiously went outside yelling \\"Stop firing!\\" in English over and over. The American shooting stopped and Lieutenant Timmermann asked him why. Busch said they wanted to surrender but were afraid of being shot. Timmermann coaxed Busch out and talked with him. Busch described the situation in the tunnel and offered to translate for the surrender. The German officers were still reluctant to surrender, but Timmermann, through Busch, finally had a German officer emerge and a peaceful surrender was arranged. Some 200 soldiers and over 100 civilians, including young Busch's mother, were escorted over the bridge to safety. It was now a little after 1715 hours; less than two hours had passed. The only German killed in the railroad tunnel that afternoon was young Willi Felten. Allied journalists termed the bridge capture the \\"Miracle of Remagen\\". General Dwight D. Eisenhower declared the bridge \\"worth its weight in gold\\"Sarasota-Herald Tribune, April 22, 1945 and \\"one of those bright opportunities of war which, when quickly and firmly grasped, produce incalculable effects on future operations\\". It remained functional, but weakened, despite the German detonation of a small charge and a stronger charge a few minutes later. The Allies used the bridge for truck and tank traffic, and eight thousand soldiers crossed it during the first 24 hours after capture. A large sign was placed on one of the stone towers marked \\"Cross the Rhine with dry feet courtesy of 9th Armd Division\\". The sign is now displayed at the Patton Museum of Cavalry and Armor at Fort Knox, Kentucky, above an M26 Pershing tank, a type used in the battle. During the days after the bridge capture, the U.S. 9th, 78th and 99th Infantry Divisions crossed the bridge. On March 17, 1945, despite furious Germans efforts to destroy it and Americans efforts to maintain it, the bridge collapsed. By then, Timmermann was on leave. = Gallery = File:Bundesarchiv Bild 173-0422, Remagen, besch√§digte Br√ºcke.jpgLudendorf Bridge between 8 and 11 March 1945 File:Remagen Bridge after capture.jpgLudendorff Bridge on 11 March 1945 File:WWII, Europe, Germany, \\"U.S. First Army at Remagen Bridge before four hours before it collapsed into the Rhine\\" - NARA - 195341.jpgLudendorff Bridge on 17 March 1945 four hours before the collapse File:Bruecke von Remagen 1945 3.jpgLudendorff Bridge on 17 March 1945 after the collapse = Furlough and honor = US Army Presidential Unit Citation Timmermann received a furlough to Paris, France. There, he read a Stars and Stripes article about the attack on the Remagen Bridge and learned he was the father of a baby girl. He also found out he was considered a hero. As news of \\"one of the war's most electrifying feats\\" filled Allied newspapers, Timmermann became a celebrity. He met Ernie Pyle and other reporters who listened to Timmermann describe how his men were the real heroes. The Omaha World-Herald reflected what other media reported. \\"[T]he young lieutenant from West Point, Nebraska, pulled off a bridge finesse that will go down in history. Lt. Timmermann led with the only card he had, raw courage.\\" Timmermann had restored his family name and honor. Sergeant Alexander A. Drabik and Timmermann were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for their actions. Distinguished Service Cross Timmermann's Distinguished Service Cross citation reads: Combat Command B of the 9th Armored was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for capturing the bridge. = Discharge and reenlistment = Timmermann was discharged from the Army on December 12, 1945. He became a salesman in Nebraska, raising his family. Timmermann missed Army life and tried to rejoin as an officer. However, all officer billets were full, so he enlisted as a technical sergeant in the Regular Army on October 28, 1947. He became a recruiter, and later an instructor with the Officers' Reserve Corps in Omaha, Nebraska. Lt. Karl H. Timmermann Sep 1945 With the start of the 'Cold War,' Timmermann was commissioned as a first lieutenant on December 26, 1948. He was assigned to Fort Omaha and the Seventh Mechanized Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop of the Seventh Infantry Division. = Korea and death = Timmermann landed with the 7th Infantry Division at Inchon, South Korea, in September 1950. He fought with his unit for several months before seeking medical treatment for ongoing abdominal pain. He was diagnosed with testicular cancer and sent back to the U.S. to Fitzsimons Hospital near Denver, Colorado, for treatment. Timmermann underwent surgery to remove the tumor, but treatment was unsuccessful. He died on October 21, 1951, at age 29. He was given a full military burial at Fort Logan National Cemetery in Colorado. A Denver reporter wrote that \\"the cancer called war had failed to take his life in two tries\\". His wife LaVera recalled, \\"He detested cancer because of the fact that it was killing him and depriving him of a soldierly duty ... He made me promise to polish up his silver stripe (bar), his buttons and his medals for the burial. He wanted every battle ribbon in proper place on his chest. He wanted to be as soldierly as possible.\\"  In popular culture  On May 30, 1965, Timmermann Park in West Point, Nebraska, was dedicated to his memory. The following books were written about Timmermann: Timmermann is honored in the following media and work: * A memorial dedicated to his actions capturing the Ludendorff Bridge during World War II was dedicated on March 7, 1995 in Timmerman Park in West Point. * A Hollywood film inspired by a book written about its capture, The Bridge at Remagen, was made in 1969. George Segal played the character Lieutenant Phil Hartman, loosely based on Timmermann. Ben Gazzara as Sergeant Angelo was very loosely based on Sgt. Alexander A. Drabik, the first soldier across the bridge. The movie portrayed the battle with a lot of angst and bloodshed contrary to real events. \\\\- * The Ludendorff Bridge features prominently in the final mission of the game Call of Duty: Finest Hour, in which the player must cross the bridge in order to capture it. * The Karl Timmermann Memorial Bridge over the Elkhorn River in West Point, Nebraska, Timmermann's hometown, is named after him. * The post theater in Fort Dix, New Jersey, is named \\"Timmermann Theater\\" in his honor. * The post theater in Ferris Kasserne (Barracks), Erlangen, West Germany, was also named \\"Timmermann Theater\\" in his honor.

It is one of seven organisations of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland (ELCF) that conduct missionary work. Its first deployments outside Finland were made to Ovamboland, an area that today is cut by the Angola-Namibian border.  History  The FMS was organized by K. J. G. Sirelius, who first worked as the society‚Äôs secretary and during 1864‚Äì1872 as its first mission director. The FMS mission school was also founded during his term.Peltola 1958, p. 91. The first missionaries from this society graduated in 1868 and were deployed to the Ovambo area in southern Africa that was later separated by colonial borders into southern Angola and northern South West Africa, today Namibia, in 1870. There they established the mission station at Omandongo, today in the Onayena Constituency of Oshikoto Region. The mission station was proclaimed a national monument in 2014. At the request of the Rhenish Missionary Society, but also due to a contempt of the politics and ideas of the German missionaries, their activities started with the Ondonga tribe of the Ovambo people. They later spread to all of Ovamboland, southern parts of Angola, and to the area that today is the Kavango Region. The first Ovambo pastors were ordained in 1925. By 1960, the society had deployed over 100 people in Ovamboland alone. Following political unrest in the Namibian struggle for independence, in the 1980s there were only 14 Finns left. After independence, Finland became one of the major supporters of development in Namibia. The Finnish Missionary Society ceded their missionary work and instead started to promote \\"friendship between the independent churches\\". Rautanen (front center) in Olukonda, 1899 The best-known Finnish missionary in Namibia was Nakambale (Oshivambo: the one who wears the hat), a nickname given to Martti Rautanen. From 1880, Rautanen worked in Olukonda at one of the first mission stations to the Ovambo people. He initiated the building of the first church in Ovamboland in 1889, and he translated the Bible into Oshindonga, a dialect of Oshivambo. With a consortium of other mission agencies, in 1966 the FELM was also involved in establishing the China Lutheran Seminary in Hsinchu City, Taiwan.

Its address is Kiriku plats (Dome Square) 1. The Dome Church is situated at the same square. History EstoniaHistoric Estonia was smaller than present-day Estonia. It included only the northern part, with Reval (Tallinn) as its capital. The southern part belonged to Livonia. Livonia‚Äôs capital was Riga. The Livonian Knighthood held the same position as the Estonian Knighthood in Estonia. There was a Livonian Knighthood House in Riga. Today it is the seat of the Saeima, the Latvian parliament. was occupied by the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, a religious order of German nobles, in the 13th century. Since then German nobles were the actual rulers in Estonia. They stayed in power when Estonia was occupied by Sweden in the 17th century and by the Russian Empire in the 18th century. Apart from a few Russians, all magistrates were German nobles. As large landowners they also possessed large parts of the Estonian soil. There were also many German nobles who opted for a career in the Imperial Russian Army. The German nobles in Estonia were united in the Estonian Knighthood. The Estonian Knighthood House was the building where the Knights met and held their festivities and where their peerage register was kept. The present building is the fourth Knighthood House. The first two were lost in fire and the third House soon became too small. The present building in Renaissance Revival style was designed by the architect Georg Winterhalter (1822-1894) and built in the years 1845-1848.Brief history of the building. In 1920, when Estonia had become independent, all privileges of the German Knights were cancelled. The building was then put into use as Estonia‚Äôs Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After the Soviet occupation of Estonia in 1940 the country had no Ministry of Foreign Affairs of its own anymore. Between 1948 and 1992 the building functioned as National Library of Estonia. In 1992 the book collection was transferred to a newly built library in the subdistrict of T√µnism√§e. In 1993 a part of the art collection from Kadriorg Palace was accommodated in the Estonian Knighthood House. Kadriorg Palace needed a restoration; moreover, in the subdistrict of Kadriorg a new art museum was being built, so that the collection could be extended too. After 2000 the art collection was gradually returned to the restored Kadriorg Palace and the newly built Kumu (an abbreviation of Kunstimuuseum). Since 2009 the Estonian Knighthood House houses the Estonian Academy of Arts, but that will move too. In 2016 the Estonian Academy of Arts will move into a reconstructed historical factory building in the Kalamaja quarter at the corner of Kotzebue t√§nav and P√µhja puiestee.The Academy's new building.

He worked several times for Robert Lippert and American International Pictures. Life and career Dexter was born in Paris, Arkansas, to William Henry and Emma (n√©e Foster) Poindexter. He has three brothers, Foster, William Jr., and James. Dexter first entered the business as a teenaged actor in The Three Stooges short, \\"Uncivil War Birds\\" (1946). After a few additional movie roles, he busied himself with stage and TV work until the Korean War and military service intervened; following his discharge, he landed an acting job on TV's The Hank McCune Show (1950) and was soon working there behind the scenes, as well. A clerical job at filmmaker Robert L. Lippert's Regal Films eventually led to Dexter producing and directing gigs at that independent production company, where many of the movies were shot in seven days on $100,000 budgets. A member of the Directors Guild of America since 1956, Dexter once directed 20 films in a year's time for 20th Century Fox. By the 1960s, he had his own production company, but the apex of his career came when he became a director for two highly successful NBC-TV series produced by actor Michael Landon, who co- created, starred in, and produced both Little House on the Prairie (1974‚Äì83) and Highway to Heaven (1984‚Äì89).

The species is native to East Asia. It is medium-sized, nocturnal, and is considered non-venomous. Two subspecies are recognised, one of which, L. r. walli, is restricted to the Ryukyu Archipelago. Etymology The subspecific name, walli, is in honor of British herpetologist Frank Wall.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Dinodon rufozonatus walli, p. 279). Lycodon comes from Greek words lykos (wolf) and odon (tooth). Description Lycodon rufozonatum typically grows to a total length (including tail) of around , reaching up to in extreme cases. The head is long and relatively flat, and somewhat separate from the neck. The medium- sized eyes bulge slightly and have vertical pupils. The ventral scales have a strong keel, while the dorsal scales are only faintly keeled; the scale count is typically 17:17:15, but can be up to 21:19:17. Geographic range Lycodon rufozonatum is found across a large part of East Asia, from the Korean Peninsula in the north (and extending just into easternmost Russia) to northern Laos and Vietnam in the south; the bulk of its range in found in eastern China. The continental populations are all placed in the nominate subspecies (L. r. rufozonatum); a second subspecies, L. r. walli, is found in the Ryukyu Archipelago of southern Japan. Behaviour and ecology Lycodon rufozonatum lives in a wide variety of habitats; it can be found from near sea level to as high as , and is most common near river plains. It is usually found on the ground, but is occasionally seen swimming in streams. It is nocturnal, feeding on fish, frogs, lizards, snakes and young birds. D. rufozonatum has a generally mild disposition, curling into a spherical mass with the head hidden when approached. Individuals can, however, be unpredictable, and some will bite readily. There are very few clinical reports on the toxinology of D. rufozonatum bites, but the species appears to be non- venomous. L. rufozonatum can harbour tapeworms of the genus Spirometra, and the consumption of raw meat from D. rufozonatum has led to cases of human sparganosis in Korea and Japan. Taxonomic history The species was first described as \\"Lycodon rufo-zonatus \\" by Theodore Edward Cantor in an 1842 paper on the fauna of \\"Chusan\\" (Zhoushan, China) in the Annals and Magazine of Natural History. Cantor included it among the \\"innocuous\\" (not venomous) species, and described it as \\"Brown, with numerous transversal crimson bands; the abdominal surface pearl-coloured, spotted with black on the tail\\". Common names L. rufozonatum is known by several common names, including \\"Asian king snake\\", \\"banded red snake\\", \\"red banded krait\\", \\"red banded odd- toothed snake\\" and \\"red-banded snake\\".

Life  It is said that he had previously taught theology and Hebrew at Milan, and had also been professor of divinity both in Spain and at Louvain. He graduated D.D., and was ‚Äòalways regarded as one of the ablest divines and controvertists of his time.‚Äô In 1577 he was laboring upon the mission in Yorkshire, and was soon afterwards committed as a prisoner to York Castle, where he engaged in a conference with Dean Hutton and some other divines of the church of England. He was ‚Äòtossed about from prison to prison till 1585, when he was shipped off at Hull, and sent into banishment.‚Äô He took refuge at the English College of Douay, then temporarily removed to Rheims, was vice- president for some time, and was afterwards made dean of Courtray. In 1622 he was at Antwerp, where Marco Antonio de Dominis, Archbishop of Spalato, repeated before him the recantation of Protestantism formerly made to the pope's nuncio at Brussels. Wright died about 1624. Wright has been very doubtfully credited with several religious tracts, which are said to have been published anonymously, but he has been much confused by bibliographers with other writers of the time of his name, and no list of his works can be given with confidence. It is probable that he was author of Certaine Articles discovering the Palpable Absurdities of the Protestants Religion (Antwerp, 1600), and The Substance of the Lord's Supper (1610, 12mo).

The weeklong Nor-Shipping is held in Lillestr√∏m near Oslo in May or June and is arranged by Norges Varemesse (Norway Trade Fairs). It features exhibitions, conferences, debates, product launches and social occasions. The fair attracts shipowners, ship builders, classification societies, technology suppliers, shipbrokers, innovators, ship financiers and industry leaders. During the trade fair week, the fair also features an exhibition called Ocean Talent Camp (previously Nor-Shipping Campus) in the Oslo city centre. It promotes careers within the industry and was visited by 10,000 students at the 2013 event. In 2017 there were around 15,500 visitors at the event, plus 900 exhibiting companies from 48 countries, 19 of which had their own national pavilions. History The predecessor to Nor-Shipping was Deck and Engine Room, held for the first time in the early 1960s by Norwegian Industrial Fairs (now Norway Trade Fairs) in cooperation with the magazine ‚Äò‚ÄòSkip‚Äô‚Äô (Ship). The first two times it was held, the event focused on local seafarers and their work on board local ships. Norwegian shipowner and magazine publisher Per Selvig saw the potential for an international shipping exhibition, and contacted Edvard Mowinckel-Larsen, then head of Norwegian Industrial Fairs, to propose a more international focus. Organized with the support of Selvig‚Äôs ‚Äò‚ÄòNorwegian Shipping News‚Äô‚Äô journal, the event was renamed International Shipping Exhibition and opened in Oslo during May 1965. A slump in maritime markets in the late 1960s meant that the next exhibition was not staged until late May 1968. The Nor-Shipping name was used for the third exhibition in 1971. In the course of the four times the biennial event has been held since 2003, it has shifted focus from technology to becoming a meeting place for a wider spectrum of interests. Exhibition A total of 22,500 square meters of exhibition space is spread over six halls and exhibitions are divided into six broad themes: IT and navigation; safety and rescue; shipbuilding and repair; maritime services and logistics; propulsion and machinery; maritime services and logistics; and innovation and venture. An artist's impression of the entrance to Nor-Shipping 2013 Conferences The two Nor-Shipping conferences attract leading maritime industry personalities, both as participants, who take part in interviews and round-table discussions, and delegates.

All three share a disenchanted view of the conflict, in opposition to the more common romantic, folk, and heroic viewpoints present in more well-known productions. Three portraits of the same conflict According to Mraz,Mraz, John cited in Perla Scwarz. La trilog√≠a de la Revoluci√≥n de Fernando de Fuentes, remasterizada y disponible en DVD. Retrieved on September 17, 2012. De Fuentes dedicates each film to one theme of conflict and loss: * El prisionero trece: Huertistas are represented in the figure of Colonel Juli√°n Carrasco, who descends into alcohol abuse and violence against his family, whom he ultimately destroys. * El compadre Mendoza: Zapatistas appear in the form of General Felipe Nieto, a fictitious cousin of Emiliano Zapata who enjoys the friendship of Rosalio Mendoza until the last years of the conflict. The only empathy shown by De Fuentes in the trilogy is demonstrated by the Zapatism in this movie. * V√°monos con Pancho Villa: Villistas are depicted as cruel and cowardly, demystifying Pancho Villa himself and his closer group of soldiers, the Dorados. Reception The three movies were not well received by audiences. Particularly ill-met was the 1936 V√°monos con Pancho Villa, which only lasted one week in theatres and ultimately led to the production company's bankruptcy. Nevertheless, thanks to critics and cineclubs, the trilogy was rediscovered and reevaluated during the 1960s as a milestone in Mexican cinema. In 2010, to commemorate the war's centenary, Filmoteca de la UNAM released a DVD edition of the restored version of the trilogy, the first attempt to popularize these films since their initial release in the 1930s.El compadre Mendoza (1933).

According to the Pakistan Hindu Council, the temple was constructed around 200 years ago and is an important worshiping site for the Hindus of the local community. The Mandir is one of the oldest operating temples and the only one situated at the banks of a creek in Karachi. Location Narayan Mandir is located under the Native Jetty Bridge, a landmark in Karachi, in the Sindh province of Pakistan. The temple overlooks the Arabian Sea which is an important place for many Hindu rituals. Festivals The temple is primarily devoted to the Hindu goddess Lakshmi & Lord Vishnu; however, it is also home to statues of Hanuman and Sai Baba of Shirdi. Main festivals celebrated in the temple are Ganesh Chaturthi, the birthday of Ganesha, and Raksha Bandhan. Hindus come to the temple to make offerings to the gods and to perform death rituals of Karni. The temple is a sacred place for offering ≈örƒÅddha and placing murtis of Goddess Durga (after performing garba for nine days) and idols of Ganesha in the sea at the end of festivals of Nao Ratree and Ganesh Chaturthi respectively. Hindus dip and take baths in the waters of the Arabian sea for ritual purification. During monsoon season, Hindu women come to the temple for fasting and to pray for the well- being of their husbands. Protection Due to port development activities and construction work near the site, the temple's access to seawater and its integrity are threatened. In September 2012, after a petition was filed by the local Hindu community, the Sindh High Court issued an order restraining the Karachi Port Trust from demolishing the temple. The petitioner believed that Mukesh Chawala, a member of the Hindu panchayat and provincial minister of excise and taxation, was responsible for the construction near the temple site. Hindu families in the region belonging to the scheduled caste believed they were being forcefully re-settled due to \\"corporate greed and a discriminatory caste system\\" by influential Hindu leaders and city authorities. The new developmental plan includes construction of an entertainment complex which will encroach upon the temple courtyard. In 1993, the temple was desecrated as revenge after the demolition of Babri Masjid in India.

Constructed in about 965, the presiding deity of the temple is Sundareswarar, a form of Shiva and the presiding goddess is Soundarambikai. The temple was visited by the Carnatic music composer Tyagaraja who composed a set of five songs collectively called the Kovur Pancharatnam.  Mythology  According to legend, Goddess Kamakshi was performing thapas () on Panchagni (fire) in Maangaadu praying to Lord Shiva to marry Her. Her penance was so intense that the whole surroundings became very hot and all living beings started to suffer because of this enormous heat. However, since Lord Shiva was deeply meditating with His eyes closed, He did not perceive this. Therefore, all Sages and Devas prayed to Lord Vishnu to save the world from the heat of the penance. Lord Vishnu directed Sri Mahalakshmi to save the world. Goddess Sri Mahalakshmi came down here to this place in the form of a cow and worshipped Lord Shiva to request Him to open His eyes, so that the world could be saved. Pleased with Her prayers, Lord Shiva opened His eyes, after which the heat of the place subsided and became cooler. As Sri Mahalakshmi worshipped here in the form of a cow, the place came to be known as Kopuri (In Thamizh, Ko means cow) and later corrupted to become Kovur.  Temple  Kovur has a massive temple for Lord Shiva built by Kulothunga Chozha, dating back to the 7th century. The main deity of this temple is Sri Sundhareswarar (also called Thirumaeneeswarar) and Goddess Sri Soundharaambigai (also called Thiruvudai Naayagi). The temple is facing south with a beautiful 7 tiered Rajagopuram. The entire Sannadhi street itself is so beautiful with shady trees and ancient houses. This temple is one among the Navagraha temples of Chennai (or Thondai Mandalam) for Sri Budhan (Mercury). Lord Sri Sundhareswarar and Goddess Sri Soundharaambigai are said to be so beautiful here and hence they are called so. It is said that, by worshipping Sri Sundhareswarar, one would be cured of many ailments. The temple has undergone Kumbhabhishekam (consecration) recently and looks fresh and new. Other deities present in the temple are Sri Veerabadhrar, Sri Valli Devasena Samedha Sri Subramanyar and Navagrahams. All 63 Naayanmaars are also present in this temple. Sri Sekkizhaar, who was born in a nearby place ‚ÄòKundrathur‚Äô, started writing ‚ÄòPeriya Puranam‚Äô from this temple only. Another rarity of this temple is the Sthala Viruksham which is the Maha Vilvam tree (Bael- Aegle marmelos). The Maha Vilvam of this temple is a very rare one that each stalk of Maha Vilvam has 27 leaves to it. This Maha Vilvam also has many medicinal properties in it. The Theertham for this temple is called Siva Gangai Theertham. This temple also has a beautiful chariot which requires renovation. Such a marvelous temple, standing tall across centuries is definitely a boon to pilgrims.  Visit by Saint Thyagaraja  Saint Thyagaraja has visited this temple on his way to Thirupathi. It is said that Saint Thyagaraja traveled on a palanquin towards Thirupathi and passed through this place. He also visited this temple on his way back. A local headman called Sundharesan asked the saint to compose and sing some songs on him. Thyagarajar refused and said that he would not sing in praise of any individual but he will sing in praise of God only and left Kovur. While travelling from Kovur, his palanquin was attacked by a group of bandits who threw stones at the palanquin and his servants in order to stop him from going further. Then Thyagaraja stopped and got down from the palanquin to explain to the bandits that he was not so rich as to be robbed and also he was on a pilgrimage to Thirupathi. The bandits approached Thyagaraja and asked him as to who threw the stones back at them during the attack? Thyagaraja denied that there were any other people with him except for the carriers of the palanquin. However, the thieves informed him that they saw 2 youngsters furiously throwing back the stones at them to save Thyagaraja. Saint Thyagaraja then realized that they were none other than Sri Rama and Sri Lakshmana who had come to his rescue. Realizing that there was some holy power to this place he again came back to Kovur temple and sang 5 compositions (Keerthanas) called ‚ÄòKovur Pancharathnam‚Äô. The local headman proudly believed that the Saint Thyagaraja had sung in his praise. However, the saint explained to him that the 5 compositions were made in praise of the Lord Sri Sundhareswarar and not the individual called Sundhareswaran. The Kovur Pancharatnams are \\"Ee Vasudha\\" (Sahaana Raagam), \\"Kori Sevimpa\\"(Karaharapriya Raagam), \\"Sambo Mahadeva\\" (Pantuvarali Raagam), \\"Nammi Vachina\\" (Kalyani Raagam) and \\"Sundareswaruni\\" (Sankarabharanam Raagam). While most of the compositions of Saint Thyagaraja are in praise of Lord Rama only, this is one of the few places where he had composed Keerthanas to other Gods.

Wells in 1895 on the concept of time travel. In the story, an unnamed time traveler travels to 802,701 A.D. using his time machine, to find that humans have evolved into two species: the Eloi, the leisure class; and the Morlocks, the working class. He meets an Eloi girl named Weena, whom he takes on an expedition and loses in his battle against the Morlocks. Three films have been based upon the story, in 1960, 1978, and 2002, each portraying Weena differently.  In the 1895 novel  In the original novel, the Time Traveler encounters Weena in the year 802,701 A.D. He rescues her from drowning in a \\"shallow\\", while the other Eloi do nothing to help. The next day, she presents him a garland of flowers, which she has made especially for him. He takes her on his expedition and decides to take her to his own time, the Victorian Era, but Weena faints and is lost in a fire when he battles the Morlocks to retrieve his time machine. He returns to his own time with two strange white flowers, which Weena had put into his pocket.  In the 1960 film  Weena portrayed by Yvette Mimieux In 1960, George Pal directed the film The Time Machine, with screenplay by David Duncan, largely based on the novel; however some significant changes were made. The name \\"George\\" (after the author, Herbert George Wells) was given to the time traveler in the film. Traveling through different times, George reaches the year 802,701 A.D. where he finds a girl drowning in a \\"shallow\\", to which her race, the Eloi, are indifferent. He rescues her and learns her name, Weena. Unlike the novel, George does not leave Weena dead. He rescues Weena and the Eloi, returns to his own time, and then to Weena‚Äôs time to be reunited with her. Weena was played by Yvette Mimieux.  In the 1978 television film  Sunn Classic Pictures produced the television film The Time Machine in 1978. Some major changes were made to the story. The time traveler is Dr. Neil Perry, a scientist from the 1970s. The story takes place in the United States instead of the United Kingdom. He travels to the far future and befriends Weena, who tells him the Morlocks take the Eloi for an unknown purpose. Perry visits the Morlocks to rescue Weena‚Äôs brother. He also teaches the Eloi how to defend themselves. He returns to his own time after completing his mission and again goes to the future to reunite with Weena. Priscilla Barnes played the role of Weena.  In the 2002 film  Another movie with the same name was produced by Arnold Leibovit and directed by Simon Wells in 2002. Weena has been renamed Mara (played by Samantha Mumba). Dr. Alexander Hartdegen is an inventor in 1899 at Columbia University who devotes his life to making a time machine after the murder of his girlfriend Emma. He travels to the year 802,701 A.D., meets the Eloi, and is nursed back to health by Mara. He rescues Mara and starts a new life with her and the Eloi.  In popular culture  * Asteroid 283142 Weena, discovered by German amateur astronomers Erwin Schwab and Rainer Kling in 2008, was named after the fictional character.

Al-Fu'ah was visited by Syrian geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi in the early 13th- century, during Ayyubid rule. He noted that it was a \\"large village in the neighborhood of Halab. From it the convent called Dair Fu'ah takes its name.\\"le Strange, 1890, p. 440. He also mentioned that the people in the town and the surrounding area including Aleppo, followed Twelver Shi'ism or as he describes it \\"Imami\\".

In July 2012 a rebel unit kidnapped three Shia Muslim civilians from the town for the stated purpose of exchanging them for anti-aircraft weaponry. In response, some of al-Fu'ah's residents kidnapped 32 Sunni Muslims from nearby Taftanaz, Saraqib and Binnish. After two weeks of negotiations, all captives were safely released.Abouzeid, Rania.

On 18 September 2015, al-Fu'ah was badly damaged, following a suicide bombing with an armoured vehicle full of explosives from Uzbek-led militant group Imam Bukhari Jamaat, an affiliate of al-Qaeda. The town was placed under siege by rebels, and on 11 January 2016, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the World Food Programme organised an aid convoy to deliver food, medicine and other aid to the town and nearby village Kafriya. On 19 July 2018, residents of Fuah and Kafriya and pro-government fighters stationed in the two besieged towns were evacuated by buses to government-controlled Aleppo under an agreement between Iran, the Syrian Government, and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, with Turkey as a mediator. Syrian Government released 1,500 HTS prisoners in exchange for the safe evacuation of these towns. Following the evacuation, the emptied towns were temporarily declared a military zone by HTS.

The LP record album was originally issued in 1975 by Trademark of Quality (TMQ), a Los Angeles-based enterprise that specialised in bootleg recordings. The albums contains studio recordings by the group between 1964 and 1968. About half of the tracks had been issued as the A-side and B-sides of singles (including two solo songs by singer Keith Relf), but remained unreleased on albums at the time. The balance is made up of album tracks, most of which were unreleased in the UK. The material, which was largely out of print in 1975, draws heavily on the Jimmy Page-era Yardbirds, plus a few recordings with Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck. Due to its popularity, a sequel, More Golden Eggs, was issued by TMQ. Both albums featured cover artwork by William Stout. Background The Yardbirds were the band that guitarists Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Jimmy Page first found commercial success. By 1975, all three had achieved superstar status, and consequently there was a strong interest in their former group's recorded output. Much of the Yardbirds' catalogue was out-of-print by 1975. The bootleg manufacturer Trademark of Quality (TMQ) saw the opportunity for a commercially viable re-release of this material. Golden Eggs was something of a first ‚Äì up until that point, rock bootlegs had been the domain of only the most successful acts, such as Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones, and the Beatles. Golden Eggs was the first big selling bootleg that dealt with a disbanded group who had had reasonable but not great chart success. At a time where reissues of old material were not commonplace, the bootleg became popular. Song selection Most of the songs that appear on the album were considered rarities at the time. They included songs which had only been released on singles or out-of-print albums, such as Little Games, the only album the Yardbirds recorded with Page. Two songs from a solo single by lead singer Keith Relf were added to the album, although they did not reflect the Yardbirds' sound or style. \\"Stroll On\\", which had only been available on the Blow-Up soundtrack album, was included. It is one of the few recordings to feature both Beck and Page on dual lead guitars. \\"Think About It\\", B-side of the last Yardbirds' single, was released only months before Led Zeppelin was formed. Page later used the guitar solo from the song for his solo in \\"Dazed and Confused\\", one of Zeppelin's signature songs. Artwork The cover artwork was drawn by William Stout, who had already designed several TMQ album covers. Stout was keen to do the cover, since he was a fan of the group and gave thanks to them on the back cover for \\"inspiration\\". He also designed the back cover as a family tree, showing the careers of the various ex-members of the group up until that point. The weasel on the cover is, according to Stout, killing off the goose that laid the golden egg, and supposed to represent the producer Mickie Most. According to Stout, he felt that Most steered the group away from their blues rock origins towards recording pop material, which, in Stout's opinion, was detrimental towards their career and did not illustrate their full potential. Releases and critical reception Golden Eggs was released by TMQ in 1975. Almost immediately, it was copied by Phony Graf, another bootlegger. Their release used black and white inserts of the front and rear covers, instead of Stout's colour artwork. All of the songs were later made available on authorized CD compilations, such as Little Games Sessions and More (1992), Train Kept A-Rollin' - The Complete Giorgio Gomelsky Productions (1993) (re-released in 2002 as The Yardbirds Story), and Ultimate! (2001). In a review for AllMusic, music critic Richie Unterberger gave the album three out of five stars. He noted that \\"this did collectors quite a service at the time, assembling 17 of the Yardbirds' rarest tracks ‚Äì from non- LP singles, soundtracks, and rare LPs ‚Äì onto one LP\\". However, he added that more recent Yardbirds reissues and compilations have made the album \\"virtually useless\\".

In the summer season, the beach is patrolled by lifeguards. The beach is made up of fine gold sand and slopes very gently into the shallow water at the head of this cove. The water at the mouth of the inlet is deeper and gives a good opportunity for diving and snorkelling. The area around the Port d'es Torrent has a small amount of developed land at the back of the beach, which consists of villas and low-rise hotels and apartments. There are several restaurants and bars in the vicinity, including one on the beach.

Description Evaluability assessments (EAs) go further than merely providing information of whether a programme can be evaluated or not.Rossi, P., Lipsey, M. W., & Freeman, H. E. (2004). Expressing and assessing program theory. In P. Rossi, M. W. Lipsey, & H. E. Freeman, Evaluation. A systematic approach (pp. 133-168). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. They are used to describe the objectives, logic and activities of the programme with an aim to investigate its credibility, feasibility, sustainability and acceptability.Jung, S. M., & Schubert, J. G. (1983). Evaluability assessment: a two-year retrospective. Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, 5(4), 435-444. EAs address the likelihood of the programme achieving its anticipated outcomes, the required changes needed for optimum management, whether an evaluation can improve the programme‚Äôs performance and to identify stakeholder interests in the evaluation and how the findings will be used.Strosberg, M. A., & Wholey, J. S. (1983). Evaluability assessment: from theory to practice in the department of health and human services. Public Administration Review, 43(1), 66-71. According to Jung and Schubert (1983) these specific aspects of a programme need to be address by an EA: *Obtaining perspectives of all involved in the programme e.g. programme staff and stakeholders *Investigating the programmes objectives the methods to measure whether they were achieved *Providing information of the how the programme is actually functioning *Identifying ways to improve the programme *Relaying important information about the programme Procedure Evaluability assessors form a workgroup which comprises an evaluation representative and a managerial member of the programme. The workgroup investigates official programme records and documentation. In addition, interviews and observations are conducted to understand and describe how the programme is perceived by the programme staff and relevant stakeholders. The workgroup is supervised by a policy group who oversees managerial decisions concerning the impending evaluation of the programme. Jung and Schubert (1983) provide six areas which ought to be addressed in an EA. These include: *Identifying the programme's objectives *Identifying the intended activities to achieve the programme objectives *Identifying incongruities between the programme's objectives and its intended activities *Investigating field operations *Comparing actual field operations to the programme's intended activities *Providing management and evaluation options Potential limitations An effective EA requires that workgroups and policy groups collaboratively engage with programme staff and stakeholders. This could be problematic when there are differences or tensions that arise between programme staff and stakeholders, posing a challenge to the EA. Thurston, Graham, and Hatfield (2003) state that EAs are beneficial since they facilitate programme revisions. It is often found that after an EA, programmes require some modifications as there could be inconsistencies with the logic model or issues concerning implementation.Thurston, W. E., Graham, J., & Hatfield, J. (2003). Evaluability assessment a catalyst for program change and improvement. Evaluation & The Health Professions, 26(2), 206-221. A tension may arise when there are positive unintended outcomes that occur when a programme is poorly designed. How do the evaluability assessors, programme staff and stakeholders manage this difficulty? Is it permissible to allow the problematic programme to operate because of the benefits derived from it, or should the programme be put on hold and reformulated resulting in the end of the positive unintended outcomes?. Conclusion EAs are complex and require cooperation from relevant individuals involved in a programme. They are subjective assessments of how credible a programme is. Despite their limitations, EAs are valuable tools to promptly address issues that arise in a programme. If an EA is efficiently conducted on a poorly designed programme, it has the potential to save programme staff and stakeholders time and funding resources that would be otherwise wasted if the programme were to continue operating unaltered.

It can be defined as the minimal surface symmetrically passing through a cycloid. In differential geometry, the Bj√∂rling problem is the problem of finding a minimal surface passing through a given curve with prescribed normal (or tangent planes).

Schwarz, J. reine angew. Math. 80 280-300 1875 The problem can be solved by extending the surface from the curve using complex analytic continuation.

Applying the method to a semicubical parabola produces the Henneberg surface, and to a circle (with a suitably twisted normal field) a minimal M√∂bius strip. A unique solution always exists. It can be viewed as a Cauchy problem for minimal surfaces, allowing one to find a surface if a geodesic, asymptote or lines of curvature is known. In particular, if the curve is planar and geodesic, then the plane of the curve will be a symmetry plane of the surface.Bj√∂rling problem. Encyclopedia of Mathematics.

Fluid escape may be impeded by sealing of the compacting rock by surrounding impermeable layers (such as evaporites, chalk and cemented sandstones). Alternatively, the rate of burial of the stratigraphic layer may be so great that the efflux of fluid is not sufficiently rapid to maintain hydrostatic pressure. Common situations where overpressure may occur: in a buried river channel filled with coarse sand that is sealed on all sides by impermeable shales, or when there is an explosion within a confined space. It is extremely important to be able to diagnose overpressured units when drilling through them, as the drilling mud weight (density) must be adjusted to compensate. If it is not, there is a risk that the pressure difference down-well will cause a dramatic decompression of the overpressured layer and result in a blowout at the well-head with possibly disastrous consequences. Because overpressured sediments tend to exhibit better porosity than would be predicted from their depth, they often make attractive hydrocarbon reservoirs and are therefore of important economic interest.

It was founded in 1975 with the aim of providing technical and artistic training for those entering the film industry. It is one of Mexico's two major film schools, the other being the Centro Universitario de Estudios Cinematogr√°ficos at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. The CCC produces about forty short films annually, as well as medium and full-length ones. The films include elements of academic work and are made to professional production standards. Courses The school has two programs of study: general cinema studies and screen-writing. The general cinema studies course lasts four years. It has a common core curriculum based on the study of the language of cinema, narrative and mise-en-scene, and documentary making. Students acquire skills in directing, producing, sound production, editing, and script writing. In addition to the core curriculum, students choose a specialism from either directing or cinematography. The screen-writing course last for two years. The course focusses on screenplay development using basic industry-standard tools and employing narrative and script structure analysis. Facilities  The CCC is fully equipped with specialised camera, sound, and lighting equipment, as well as props. It can cater for three groups filming in 16mm, one group in S16mm, one in 35mm, and four in video, simultaneously. The CCC also offers full sound and image post-production facilities, in various professional film and video formats, and has full laboratory, transfer, mixing, and re-recording facilities for students to complete their films. It also has three classrooms equipped with audiovisual equipment for theory classes, three 16 and 35 mm cinemas, two video screening rooms, a stage for film and television production, a fully equipped still photo lab, a production office for student projects, a library, a video library, a film library, an audio library, and a cafeteria. Additionally, the school is equipped with a computer network featuring specialised CGI and production software. Teachers The CCC includes industry professionals and prominent filmmakers amongst its staff, including Francisco Athi√©, Siegfried Barjau, Carlos Bolado, Christiane Burkhard, Simon Bross, Carlos Carrera, Felipe Cazals, Nicholas Echeverria, Luis Estrada, Jorge Fons, Jose Luis Garcia Agraz, Guillermo Granillo, Henner Hofmann, Toni Khun, Beatriz Novaro, Maria Novaro, Ignacio Ortiz, Mariana Stavenhagen, Alfredo Joskowicz . Opera Prima The CCC, supported by the Mexican Institute of Cinematography, has in recent years been particularly instrumental in developing a project known as Opera Prima, giving young film- makers, producers, writers, and cinematographers - selected via internal competition - the opportunity to produce their first features and make their d√©buts. The close involvement of the school's students in the various aspects of the production process, and the opportunity for them to shoot their first film, with institutional support provided by the school, are just some of the features of this project, which bridges the gap between the professional film industry and strictly academic film production. Some of the films that have emerged from the CCC's Opera Prima Project have achieved international recognition, including El secreto de Romelia by Busi Cort√©s, La mujer de Benjam√≠n by Carlos Carrera, Lolo by Francisco Athi√©, and La orilla de la tierra by Ignacio Ortiz.

Municipally, it is incorporated as Loknya Urban Settlement, the only urban settlement in the district. Population: History The area was populated since medieval times and was located on the waterways which connected Novgorod and Pskov with Velikiye Luki. In the 15th century, the pogost of Vlitsy was founded, which later became a part of Loknya. In the 15th century, the area was annexed by the Grand Duchy of Moscow. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, it was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate). In 1727, separate Novgorod Governorate was split off, and in 1772, Pskov Governorate (which between 1777 and 1796 existed as Pskov Viceroyalty) was established. The area was a part of Velikoluksky Uyezd of Pskov Governorate. Loknya was founded in 1900 as a settlement serving the railway station on the railway between Moscow and Riga. Eventually, it became the administrative center of Loknyanskaya Volost of Velikoluksky Uyezd. The name of the station originates from the nearby Loknya River. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished, and Loknyansky District was established, with the administrative center in Loknya. The governorates were abolished as well, and the district became a part of Velikiye Luki Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On June 17, 1929, the district was transferred to Western Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were also abolished and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On January 29, 1935, Western Oblast was abolished, and the district was transferred to Kalinin Oblast, and on February 5 of the same year, Loknyansky District became a part of Velikiye Luki Okrug of Kalinin Oblast, one of the okrugs abutting the state boundaries of the Soviet Union. On May 11, 1937, the district was transferred to Opochka Okrug. On May 4, 1938, the district was subordinated directly to the oblast. Between 1941 and 1944, Loknya was occupied by German troops. On August 22, 1944, the district was transferred to newly established Velikiye Luki Oblast. On October 2, 1957, Velikiye Luki Oblast was abolished and Loknyansky District was transferred to Pskov Oblast. The district was abolished on February 1, 1963, and re-established on January 12, 1965. Economy =Industry= Loknya contains enterprises of timber and food industries, the biggest being the bakery. =Transportation= Loknya is a railway station on the railway connecting St. Petersburg and Vitebsk. It is connected by roads with Bezhanitsy (with access to Porkhov and Novorzhev), with Kholm, and with Velikiye Luki. There are also local roads.

Instead of starting his senior year at Harvard, Boni convinced his father to finance the establishment (originally at 95 Fifth Avenue and then at 135 MacDougal Street) of the Washington Square Bookshop with Albert's brother Charles as a partner. The Boni brothers' book store became a meeting place for leftist, Greenwich Village writers and intellectuals. The Boni brothers, with two other partners, created the Little Leather Library of pocket-sized editions of literary classics bound in imitation leather. These editions were hugely successful ‚Äî the Woolworth stores sold a million copies in one year. In 1913‚Äì1914 the Boni brothers published the short-lived literary magazine The Glebe. In 1914, Boni, with Lawrence Langner and others, founded the Washington Square Players. In 1915 the Boni brothers sold the Washington Square Bookshop to Frank Shay.The Shop: The Greenwich Village Bookshop Door, Harry Ransom Center, U. of Texas at Austin In 1917, Boni married Cornelia 'Nell' van Leeuwen, a widow with a young son, who was adopted by Boni upon the marriage.Albert Boni: An Inventor of His Readex Microprint Corporation Collection at the Harry Ransom Center With financial backing from Horace Liveright's father-in-law, paper executive Herman Elsas, the two partners Boni and Horace Liveright incorporated the publishing house Boni & Liveright on February 16, 1917. Boni & Liveright founded the Modern Library (originally called Modern Library of the World's Best Classics), which was eventually acquired by Random House. The Modern Library was financed by $25,000 from Felix M. Warburg and the Boni brothers' uncle Thomas Seltzer. A year and a half after incorporating, Boni sold his interest in Boni & Liveright to Horace Liveright in 1919. However, the name of the firm remained \\"Boni & Liveright\\" until 1928, when the name of the publishing house was changed to \\"Horace Liveright, Inc.\\" In 1923 the Boni brothers purchased the publishing company Lieber & Lewis and renamed it the \\"Albert and Charles Boni Publishing Company.\\" In 1926, they purchased the publishing business of their uncle, Thomas Seltzer. In 1929 the Boni brothers created Boni Paper Books, which offered one soft-cover book per month for 12 months for a yearly subscription price of $5. Boni Paper Books failed during the Great Depression. In 1939, Boni founded the Readex Microprint Corporation, a microfilm publisher of reference materials. When Boni retired in 1974 his only son, William, took over as president of Readex. Boni died in Florida in 1981 and was survived by his wife, his son, and his son's three daughters. Microprint A Guide to the Literature of Photography and Related Subjects published by Albert Boni (1943) While microphotography precedes microprint, microprint was conceived by Boni in 1934 when he was inspired by his friend, writer and editor Manuel Komroff who was showing his experimentation's related to the enlarging of photographs. It occurred to Boni that if he could reduce rather than enlarge photographs this technology may enable publication companies and libraries to access much greater quantities of data at a minimum cost of material and storage space. Over the following decade, Boni worked to develop microprint, a micro-opaque process in which pages were photographed using 35mm microfilm and printed on cards using offset lithography. This process proved to produce a 6\\" by 9\\" index card which stored 100 pages of text from the normal sized publications he was reproducing. Boni began the Readex Microprint company to produce and license this technology. He also published an article A Guide to the Literature of Photography and Related Subjects (1943) which appeared in a supplemental 18th issue of the Photo-Lab Index.

Early life According to John E. Woods, Sara Khatun was the daughter of Pir Ali Bayandur, the ruler of Kiƒüƒ±. Pir Ali was himself the son of the Aq Qoyunlu ruler Fakhr ad-Din Qutlu by his Pontic wife Maria Comnena, sister of Alexios III of Trebizond. Franz Babinger speculates that Sara Khatun was an Aramaic Christian who had grown up near Diyarbakir,Babinger, Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time, edited by William C. Hickman and translated by Ralph Manheim (Princeton: University Press, 1978), p. 192 but this speculation is based on an earlier assumption by Vladimir Minorsky which he later renounced.John E. Woods.

University of Utah Press, 1999; p. 34, 242 Sara Khatun married her paternal cousin Ali, the son of the leader of the Aq Qoyunlu federation Qara Osman.John E. Woods. The Aqquyunlu: Clan, Confederation, Empire. University of Utah Press, 1999; p. 242 Diplomatic activity Sara Khatun was a skilful diplomat and headed embassies for the purpose of regulating disputed issues. Sara Khatun was also famous on the west, ambassadors of foreign countries often took advantage from her influence on son.. Negotiations with Mehmed II, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire were especially successful. The first round of negotiations with Mehmed II was held in 1463, in Goyluhisar. There she could make peace, according to which Uzun Hassan promised not to impede seizure of Trebzond by the Ottoman Turks, and Turks had to leave the territory of the Aq Qoyunlu. She even could persuade the Sultan that the treasury of Trebizond should belong to his bride ‚Äì Despine Khatun, princess of Trabzon and to bring this wealth to a palace of her son. During these negotiations Mehmed II and Sara Khatun called each other \\"mother\\" and \\"son\\". For example, during Trabzon negotiations Sara Khatun said Mehmed II that: { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\"  width=\\"50%\\" style=\\"background:#f6f6f6;\\"  ‚ÄúWhy to waste so much efforts, my son, - she said to Sultan who accepted her, - because of any nonsense, such as Trabzon?‚Äù } Sara Khatun also helped the last Trapezuntine Emperor by providing him and his family with freedom. She took his promise not to disturb the emperor and his family taking advantage of her good relations with Mehmed II. And Mehmed II redeemed his promise, given to Sara Khatun: the Emperor and his children and young nephew Alexis were graciously accepted by Sultan and were sent to Constantinople on a special ship with courtiers and all private property, except piles of jewelry which were given to Sara Khatun as a reward for her polite intermediation. Sara Khatun also was sent to the Timurid ruler Abu Said for negotiations, but these were unsuccessful.

According to information on the site, it currently offers access to profiles of over 20,000 agencies as well as a searchable library of more than 90,000 different ads from 110 countries around the world. An article on the website of the French newspaper Le Figaro in 2010 cited 20,000 agencies and 100,000 campaigns. AdForum was founded by Herv√© de Clerck, a French former adman who held posts including Managing Director International of Havas Intermediation, Vice President of DMB&B; Inc, CEO of DMB&B; France and COO of Lesieur. In 2001, de Clerck used AdForum as a springboard for launching ACT Responsible, an association that aims to recognise excellence in cause-related advertising. Apart from its website, its main platform is an annual exhibition and awards ceremony at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. In June 2009, Kofi Annan, former Secretary General of the United Nations, President of the Global Humanitarian Forum, and David Jones, Global CEO of Havas Worldwide and co-founder of One Young World, joined a debate on climate change hosted by ACT Responsible and AdForum founder Herv√© de Clerck at the 56th Cannes International Advertising Festival. In 2000, AdForum unveiled its AdFolio service, a searchable library of advertising creative work. It was described by US trade magazine Adweek as \\"a brainstorming tool for creative people, a new-business generator for ad agencies and a scouting mechanism for brand managers.\\" AdForum.com also offers services such as a job board and a weekly \\"best ads\\" newsletter. Membership is free and members are entitled to receive the newsletter as well as news alerts relating to their specific areas of interest, such as agencies, brands or industry awards. However, access to the creative library requires a paid subscription. The site offers a number of packages, for example US$49 for one month, $299 for one year (or $149 for students and professors) and $1799 a year for up to ten users. AdForum also earns income from paid advertising on its site. Since 2005, AdForum has held regular summits in cities such as Paris, New York, London and (in 2009) Shanghai. As noted by the French advertising trade journal Strat√©gies, , \\"AdForum: Le Debriefing...\\", October 2, 2003. the invitation-only event is designed to bring agency search consultants together with agency CEOs. At its worldwide summit in New York at the end of 2011, AdForum helped create a Code of Conduct for agency search consultants, who match advertisers with agencies. According to a report by themediaonline, consultants organised their code of conduct around seven key principles that they will follow during the agency selection process: excellence, equity, responsibility, integrity, absence of conflict of interest, transparency and confidentiality.

In mathematics a group is a set together with a binary operation on the set called multiplication that obeys the group axioms. The axiom of choice is an axiom of ZFC set theory which in one form states that every set can be wellordered. In ZF set theory, i.e. ZFC without the axiom of choice, the following statements are equivalent: * For every nonempty set there exists a binary operation such that is a group.A cancellative binary operation suffices, i.e. such that is a cancellative magma. See below. * The axiom of choice is true.  A group structure implies the axiom of choice  In this section it is assumed that every set can be endowed with a group structure . Let be a set. Let be the Hartogs number of . This is the least cardinal number such that there is no injection from into . It exists without the assumption of the axiom of choice. Assume here for technical simplicity of proof that has no ordinal. Let denote multiplication in the group . For any there is an such that . Suppose not. Then there is an such that for all . But by elementary group theory, the are all different as Œ± ranges over (i). Thus such a gives an injection from into . This is impossible since is a cardinal such that no injection into exists. Now define a map of into endowed with the lexicographical wellordering by sending to the least such that . By the above reasoning the map exists and is unique since least elements of subsets of wellordered sets are unique. It is, by elementary group theory, injective. Finally, define a wellordering on by if . It follows that every set can be wellordered and thus that the axiom of choice is true. For the crucial property expressed in (i) above to hold, and hence the whole proof, it is sufficient for to be a cancellative magma, e.g. a quasigroup. The cancellation property is enough to ensure that the are all different.  The axiom of choice implies a group structure  Any nonempty finite set has a group structure as a cyclic group generated by any element. Under the assumption of the axiom of choice, every infinite set is equipotent with a unique cardinal number which equals an aleph. Using the axiom of choice, one can show that for any family of sets (A). Moreover, by Tarski's theorem on choice, another equivalent of the axiom of choice, for all finite (B). Let be an infinite set and let denote the set of all finite subsets of . There is a natural multiplication on . For , let , where denotes the symmetric difference. This turns into a group with the empty set, , being the identity and every element being its own inverse; . The associative property, i.e. is verified using basic properties of union and set difference. Thus is a group with multiplication . Any set that can be put into bijection with a group becomes a group via the bijection. It will be shown that , and hence a one-to-one correspondence between and the group exists. For , let be the subset of consisting of all subsets of cardinality exactly . Then is the disjoint union of the . The number of subsets of of cardinality is at most because every subset with elements is an element of the -fold cartesian product of . So for all (C) by (B). Putting these results together it is seen that by (A) and (C). Also, , since contains all singletons. Thus, and , so, by the Schr√∂der‚ÄìBernstein theorem, . This means precisely that there is a bijection between and . Finally, for define . This turns into a group. Hence every set admits a group structure.  A ZF set with no group structure  There are models of ZF in which the axiom of choice fails. In such a model, there are sets that cannot be well-ordered (call these \\"non-wellorderable\\" sets). Let be any such set. Now consider the set . If were to have a group structure, then, by the construction in first section, can be well-ordered. This contradiction shows that there is no group structure on the set . If a set is such that it cannot be endowed with a group structure, then it is necessarily non- wellorderable. Otherwise the construction in the second section does yield a group structure. However these properties are not equivalent. Namely, it is possible for sets which cannot be well-ordered to have a group structure. For example, if X is any set, then \\\\mathcal P(X) has a group structure, with symmetric difference as the group operation. Of course, if X cannot be well- ordered, then neither can \\\\mathcal P(X). One interesting example of sets which cannot carry a group structure is from sets X with the following two properties: # X is an infinite Dedekind-finite set. In other words, X has no countably infinite subset. # If X is partitioned into finite sets, then all but finitely many of them are singletons. To see that the combination of these two cannot admit a group structure, note that given any permutation of such set must have only finite orbits, and almost all of them are necessarily singletons which implies that most elements are not moved by the permutation. Now consider the permutations given by x\\\\mapsto a\\\\cdot x, for a which is not the neutral element, there are infinitely many x such that a\\\\cdot x=x, so at least one of them is not the neutral element either. Multiplying by x^{-1} gives that a is in fact the identity element which is a contradiction. The existence of such a set X is consistent, for example given in Cohen's first model. Surprisingly, however, being an infinite Dedekind-finite set is not enough to rule out a group structure, as it is consistent that there are infinite Dedekind-finite sets with Dedekind-finite power sets.

He is a sixth generation successor of the Wah Lum Pai Tam Tui Northern Praying Mantis style as well as also being a 33rd generation successor of the Shaolin Temple. He was instrumental in bringing the Wah Lum martial arts style to the United States. Chan is the last living disciple of Lee Kwan Shan, and has since studied under several other masters. Martial arts training Chan began training Wah Lum Pai at the age of six when he was accepted by Lee Kwan Shan. When Lee died, he finished his training under his senior Chan Wan Ching. Chan also trained with numerous grandmasters in China studying kung fu. Wah Lum Pai history Wah Lum Pai/Hua Lin Pai ËèØÊûóÊ¥æ (Elegant Forest Style) is a Chinese martial art that has its origins in the Northern Praying Mantis System (Ëû≥ËûÇÊã≥) created by Wang Long (ÁéãÊúó) in the Shaolin Monastery (Â∞ëÊûóÂØ∫) some 350 years ago. After several generations, Ching Yueng (ÊæÑÈ£¨Á¶™Â∏´) became the abbot of the Wah Lum Temple (ËèØÊûóÂØ∫) located in the Ping To District of the Shantung Â±±Êù± Province, China. It was at the Wah Lum Temple (ËèØÊûóÂØ∫) that Lee Kwan Shan (ÊùéÊòÜÂ±±), an exponent of his family's martial art Tam Tui style, would study Northern Praying Mantis to a level to be given the title of fifth generation heir/lineage holder. Upon finishing his studies Lee Kwan Shan resumed his previous occupation as a guard and escort. After a successful career he retired with his remaining years traveling extensively around China, demonstrating his skill. Eventually he settled in a small Village named Sha Cheng where he began taking on students. Two of Lee Kwan Shan‚Äôs most recognized students are Wan Ching Chan (Èô≥Èõ≤Èùí) and Pui Chan (Èô≥Âüπ). Chan Wan Ching was Lee‚Äôs most senior student and continued his school in Hong Kong after his teacher‚Äôs death. Pui Chan finished up his training under Wan Ching Chan before resettling in the United States to open up his own school. USA school Chan would later make his way to Hong Kong, by swimming from the mainland where he became a seaman. His job eventually moved him to New York City. Subsequently, in 1968, Chan formed a kung fu school in Boston. In 1980, he and his family moved to Orlando, Florida, where he built the Wah Lum Kung-fu temple. It was the first of its kind in the United States where students of all ages and skill levels could go to live and train the Wah Lum Style daily.

S√∏ren Kierkegaard's influence and reception varied widely and may be roughly divided into various chronological periods. Reactions were anything but uniform, and proponents of various ideologies attempted to appropriate his work quite early. Kierkegaard's reputation as a philosopher was first established in his native Denmark with his work Either/Or.Garff, Joakim. S√∏ren Kierkegaard: A Biography. Trans. Bruce H. Kirmmse. Princeton, 2005, 0-691-09165-X Henriette Wulff, in a letter to Hans Christian Andersen, wrote, \\"Recently a book was published here with the title Either/Or! It is supposed to be quite strange, the first part full of Don Juanism, skepticism, et cetera, and the second part toned down and conciliating, ending with a sermon that is said to be quite excellent. The whole book attracted much attention. It has not yet been discussed publicly by anyone, but it surely will be. It is actually supposed to be by a Kierkegaard who has adopted a pseudonym....\\" Kierkegaard's fame in Denmark increased with each publication of his philosophical works, including Fear and Trembling and Philosophical Fragments, and culminating in his magnum opus, the Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments. However, Kierkegaard's attack upon Christendom, represented by the Danish National Church near the end of his life, did not endear him to many in the clergy and theological circles. After his death, his original manuscripts were bequeathed by his one- time fianc√©e, Regine Olsen for posterity. She later donated most of his writings to the Danish Royal Library where they continue to be stored. Kierkegaard's thought gained a wider audience with the translation of his works into German, French, and English. Kierkegaard and philosophy and theology Royal Library Garden in Copenhagen Many 20th-century philosophers, both theistic and atheistic, drew concepts from Kierkegaard, including the notions of angst, despair, and the importance of the individual. His fame as a philosopher grew tremendously in the 1930s, in large part because the ascendant existentialist movement pointed to him as a precursor, although later writers celebrated him as a highly significant and influential thinker in his own right. Since Kierkegaard was raised as a Lutheran, he was commemorated as a teacher in the Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church on 11 November and in the Calendar of Saints of the Episcopal Church with a feast day on 8 September. Philosophers and theologians influenced by Kierkegaard include Hans Urs von Balthasar, Karl Barth, Simone de Beauvoir, Niels Bohr, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Emil Brunner, Martin Buber, Rudolf Bultmann, Albert Camus, Martin Heidegger, Abraham Joshua Heschel, Karl Jaspers, Gabriel Marcel, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Reinhold Niebuhr, Franz Rosenzweig, Jean-Paul Sartre, Joseph Soloveitchik, Paul Tillich, Malcolm Muggeridge, Thomas Merton, Miguel de Unamuno.Unamuno refers to Kierkegaard in his book The Tragic Sense of Life, Part IV, \\"In The Depths of the Abyss\\" Paul Feyerabend's epistemological anarchism in the philosophy of science was inspired by Kierkegaard's idea of subjectivity as truth. Ludwig Wittgenstein was immensely influenced and humbled by Kierkegaard, claiming that \\"Kierkegaard is far too deep for me, anyhow. He bewilders me without working the good effects which he would in deeper souls\\". Karl Popper referred to Kierkegaard as \\"the great reformer of Christian ethics, who exposed the official Christian morality of his day as anti-Christian and anti-humanitarian hypocrisy\\". Kierkegaard and psychology Kierkegaard had a profound influence on psychology. He is widely regarded as the founder of Christian psychology and of existential psychology and therapy. Existentialist (often called \\"humanistic\\") psychologists and therapists include Ludwig Binswanger, Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Carl Rogers, and Rollo May. May based his The Meaning of Anxiety on Kierkegaard's The Concept of Anxiety. Kierkegaard's sociological work Two Ages: The Age of Revolution and the Present Age critiques modernity. Ernest Becker based his 1974 Pulitzer Prize book, The Denial of Death, on the writings of Kierkegaard, Freud and Otto Rank. Kierkegaard is also seen as an important precursor of postmodernism. Kierkegaard and literature Kierkegaard influenced 19th- century literature writers as well as 20th-century literature. August Strindberg (1843-1912) found inspiration in Kierkegaard and the famous Norwegian dramatist and poet Henrik Ibsen (1828-1906) clearly seems to have been inspired by the Dane in famous works such as Brand. The other great Norwegian national writer and poet Bjornstjerne Bjornson (1832-1910) was also deeply inspired by Kierkegaard.See In God's Way, by Bjornson In God's Way. Bjornson names one of his characters Soren Pedersen. Kierkegaard's father's name was Michael Pedersen Kierkegaard. Finally the celebrated Norwegian artist Edvard Munch (1863-1944) closely studied key concepts such as anxiety, and this influence is notable in some of his iconic paintings such as The Scream.Kierkegaard's Influence on Literature, Criticism and Art: The Germanophone World Feb 28, 2013, by Jon Stewart p. xii Other figures deeply influenced by his work include W. H. Auden, Jorge Luis Borges, Don DeLillo, Hermann Hesse, Franz Kafka, David Lodge, Flannery O'Connor, Walker Percy, Rainer Maria Rilke, J.D. Salinger and John Updike. Kierkegaard's work The Diary of a Seducer has been re-published several times, including Princeton University Press' translation with John Updike's foreword and Penguin Books' series Great Loves. Kierkegaard after World War I Kierkegaard's present stature in the English-speaking world owes much to the exegetical writings and improved Kierkegaard translations by the American theologian Walter Lowrie, the University of Minnesota philosopher David F. Swenson, and the Danish translators Howard and Edna Hong. Anthony Rudd's book Kierkegaard and the Limits of the Ethical and Alasdair MacIntyre's discussion of Kierkegaard in After Virtue and A Short History of Ethics did much to facilitate Kierkegaard's legacy in ethical thought in analytic philosophy. Kierkegaard's influence on continental philosophy increased dramatically after the First and Second World Wars, especially among the German existenz thinkers and French existentialists. Jean-Paul Sartre, Emmanuel Levinas, and Karl Barth all owe a heavy debt to Kierkegaard. Paul Ricoeur and Judith Butler wrote monographs drawing new attention to Kierkegaard's work, and a 1964 UNESCO colloquium on Kierkegaard in Paris ranks as one of the most important events for a generation's reception of Kierkegaard, which included a keynote speaker, Sartre who gave his lecture The Singular Universal, which solidified Kierkegaard's influence over existentialism.Matu≈°t√≠k, M. (1995), Kierkegaard in Post/Modernity, Indiana University Press, p. 18. In America, interest in Kierkegaard was revived from the 1980s onwards, particularly by the American philosopher and curator of the Kierkegaard Library at St. Olaf College Gordon Marino, who has devoted several books and essays to Kierkegaard. In Kierkegaard's native Denmark, the Danish people hosted his 200th anniversary of Kierkegaard's birth in Copenhagen in May 2013.Kierkegaard in 2013 Kierkegaard has also influenced members of the analytical philosophy tradition, most notably Ludwig Wittgenstein, who considered Kierkegaard to be \\"the most profound thinker of the [nineteenth] century. Kierkegaard was a saint.\\"Notes on Wittgenstein's Reading of Kierkegaard by Jens Glebe-Moeller. To some degree, Kierkegaard can be seen as one of the few philosophers to whom the simple analytic/continental divide does not fully apply. Kierkegaard predicted his posthumous fame, and foresaw that his work would become the subject of intense study and research. In his journals, he wrote: Kierkegaard and feminism Kierkegaard's relationship to feminism is a troublesome one, Kierkegaard has been described as misogynistic, making \\"snide comments about woman‚Äôs nature, mocking with utmost irony her ‚Äúgreat abilities‚Äù and sneering at the possibility of her emancipation\\" although Dera Sipe of Villanova University states that viewing Kierkegaard as a \\"straight misogynist is highly problematic\\". In her paper Kierkegaard and Feminism: A Paradoxical Friendship, Sipe commends Kierkegaard for taking \\"a hammer to the cold foundations of traditional Western philosophy\\" and introducing existentialism which feminism has adopted and thrived in. She then states that due to Kierkegaard's rampant use of Pseudonyms one must separate Kierkegaard from his Pseudonyms. Sipe argues that it \\"would be of more benefit to feminism not to read Kierkegaard in search of his own personal stance on the woman question, but rather to read him in an exploratory manner as one who has exposed new avenues of thought, new ways of examining the woman question\\". Sipe, after examining his essay on the suffragette movement and the seducer's diary and their misogynistic content, then pivots towards Kierkegaard's view on the Virgin Mary, mother of Jesus and Sarah, the young daughter of Raguel and Edna both of whom Kierkegaard considers to be knights of faith. She states that from these examples it is clear that Kierkegaard (or at least Johannes de Silentio) did hold great respect for women.  International reception  = In France = Kierkegaard was first mentioned in a French publication in 1856 in ' () in an article detailing the state of Danish politics and culture which described his influence on the Danish church as having \\"bewildered many minds and troubled many weak or fearful consciences\\". The article also detailed the controversy around his funeral. The first translation of Kierkegaard into French was published in 1886 by Johannes G√∏tzsche, with a preface by the theologian Hans-Peter Kofoed-Hansen. The work translated was Two Minor Ethical-Religious Essays (). Subsequent translations of Kierkegaard into French include those produced by Paul Petit, who produced a French translation of the Concluding Unscientific Postscript in 1941, as well as a translation of the Philosophical Fragments, published posthumously in 1947. = In Germany = The earliest mentions of Kierkegaard's work in German publications were written by Andreas Frederik Beck, himself Danish and one of the attendees at Kierkegaard's oral dissertation defence. There was an anonymous German review of Philosophical Fragments published in 1845 which subsequent scholarship believes was written by Beck. Kierkegaard responded to Beck's criticisms in a footnote published in the followup to the Fragments, the Concluding Unscientific Postscript. Another early mention of Kierkegaard in German is from Johann Georg Theodor Gr√§sse, who included Kierkegaard briefly in an 1848 review of European literature. In 1856, the Bavarian-born conservative politician and historian Joseph Edmund J√∂rg wrote an article discussing religious movements and events in Scandinavian history. The Catholic J√∂rg praised Kierkegaard's relentless attack on the Danish Lutheran Church, but suggests that Kierkegaard should perhaps have seen Catholicism as a final step in his religious development. Early translations of Kierkegaard into German were restricted to his post-1850 material (The Moment, the attack on the Lutheran Church) and appeared in the 1860s. The T√ºbingen-trained pastor, Albert B√§rthold, studied Kierkegaard under Johann Tobias Beck and published translations of a number of Kierkegaard's works. The most significant translation work was conducted by Christoph Schrempf, another student of J.T. Beck. Schrempf's first translations appeared in 1890 and by 1922, he had completed translations of the entire set of Kierkegaard's published writings. His translations have been criticised repeatedly as unreliable: Heiko Schulz referred to them as \\"repeatedly revised, highly idiosyncratic, and at times breathtakingly free renditions of the Kierkegaardian texts\\". Schrempf also spread a view of Kierkegaard significantly out-of-step from the mainstream, interpreting Kierkegaard's \\"subjectivity as truth\\" as a justification for his own religious disbelief.

The advantage to an organisation of attaining this unified view comes from the ability it gives to analyse past behaviour in order to better target and personalise future customer interactions. A single customer view is also considered especially relevant where organisations engage with customers through multichannel marketing, since customers expect those interactions to reflect a consistent understanding of their history and preferences. However, some commentators have challenged the idea that a single view of customers across an entire organisation is either natural or meaningful, proposing that the priority should instead be consistency between the multiple views that arise in different contexts. Where representations of a customer are held in more than one data set, achieving a single customer view can be difficult: firstly because customer identity must be traceable between the records held in those systems, and secondly because anomalies or discrepancies in the customer data must be data cleansed for data quality. As such, the acquisition by an organisation of a single customer view is one potential outcome of successful master data management.

It is commonly called sea vomit, marine vomit, pancake batter tunicate, or carpet sea squirt. It is thought to be native to Japan, but it has been reported as an invasive species in a number of places in Europe, North America and New Zealand. It is sometimes given the nickname \\"D. vex\\" because of the vexing way in which it dominates marine ecosystems when introduced into new locations, however the species epithet vexillum actually derives from the Latin word for flag, and the species was so named because of the way colonies' long tendrils appear to wave in the water like a flag. D. vexillum can grow on most hard substrates, including cobble, boulders, and artificial structures including boats, dock pilings, and aquaculture equipment. It can also grow over other organisms, including sessile invertebrates, algae, and eelgrass. Its appearance has given rise to the common names of sea vomit or marine vomit. It was first described from New Zealand as Didemnum vexillum by Patricia Kott in 2002. The species had been discovered previously in its native region of Japan. Description A colony of Didemnum vexillum consists of a number of sac-shaped zooids connected by a common tunic. Each zooid is about long and has a buccal siphon through which water is drawn into the interior. The water then passes into a shared cavity from which it is pumped out through an atrial siphon. The surface of the colony is smooth, leathery, and often veined in appearance; the buccal siphons appear as numerous fine pores, and the atrial siphons as a smaller number of larger holes. The colony is firmly attached to a hard surface from which it can be difficult to detach. D. vexillum has different forms in different locations. It can form a thin or thick encrusting mat, or form large or small lobes. The colour can be orange, pink, tan, creamy yellow or greyish-white and the tunic is sparsely strengthened by stellate spicules with nine to eleven rays. Where there is little water movement, the colonies may dangle in ropey masses from hard substrates, such as cables, docks, and the hulls of vessels. These stringy formations have led to it being colloquially referred to as \\"Sea Cheese\\" in Canada. In places with stronger currents, they cover the surface of rocks, boulders, pebbles, gravel, and oysterbeds in a thin, encrusting layer. Distribution Tunicate colony of Didemnum vexillum. Large openings are atrial siphons; brown material in them is interpreted to be faecal matter in cavities below the apertures. Didemnum vexillum appears to be native to Japan, where it was recorded in Mutsu Bay in 1926. It is still common there and, as well as growing on rock surfaces and seagrasses (Zostera), it grows as a fouling organism on cultured bivalves, net cages, pilings and other man-made structures. Its depth range is from the intertidal zone down to a depth of about . The Portuguese oyster (Crassostrea angulata) cultivated off the Atlantic coast of France and Portugal was largely killed by an iridoviral disease in 1969. To replace the stock, large quantities of Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) spat were imported from Japan. Some efforts were made to kill any fouling organisms that might be associated with the spat by immersing it for two periods, each of one hour, in fresh water. However, in the early 1970s, there were reports of a brown Didemnum ascidian on oyster beds in the region. Around the same time, oyster spat from Japan was introduced into the Pacific coastal regions of Canada and the USA and soon afterwards an ascidian was observed there, and later identified as D. vexillum. By 2014, this tunicate was present in the eastern Atlantic, North Sea and Mediterranean Sea in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and Italy. On the east coast of North America its range extended from New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, to Maine. In the eastern Pacific its range extends from Alaska to California. It is also present in New Zealand, where it was first observed in 2001, its only known encroachment into the Southern Hemisphere. Because this ascidian broods its embryos and the larvae are free-swimming for only a brief time, natural dispersal of D. vexillum is limited in extent. Dispersal to new habitats in far flung parts of the world is likely to be through its accidental conveyance on the hulls of boats or other floating structures, or its introduction to aquaculture installations, perhaps with commercial oyster spat, seed mussels or aquaculture equipment. Biology Like other colonial ascidians, Didemnum vexillum is a suspension feeder. Water is drawn in through the buccal siphon of each zooid, the plankton and fine particles of detritus are filtered out, and the water and waste products leave through a common atrial siphon. Each individual zooid is a hermaphrodite. Sperm is liberated into the sea and may get drawn into another zooid with the water current, fertilisation taking place internally. The embryos have yolks from which they derive nourishment while they are brooded inside the colonial tunic. When they hatch, after about two weeks, the larvae have a short free-living stage lasting up to a few hours, before undergoing metamorphosis into a zooid ready to found a new colony. The new colony grows by asexual reproduction, with new zooids budding off existing ones. A fragment of a colony may become detached (perhaps by \\"dripping\\" off a floating structure), adhere to a new substrate and found a new colony. Such colonies can grow rapidly, with a six- to eleven-fold increase in colony size having been observed over a fifteen-day period. Invasive impact Didemnum vexillum is capable of forming large colonies which can overgrow rocks and gravel, smother benthic organisms and change the marine balance of the seafloor community. In some places in the Netherlands it covers 95% of the seabed and there is a marked decrease in populations of the sea urchin Psammechinus miliaris and the brittle star Ophiothrix fragilis. On the Georges Bank, Massachusetts, the seabed community is also changed, with some invertebrates decreasing but others, such as two species of polychaete worm, increasing in abundance. Here, D. vexillum restricts the potential settling sites for larvae of the bay scallop (Argopecten irradians) and the sea scallop (Placopecten magellenaicus). It exudes a toxic substance which discourages predators and prevents the larvae of other species from settling on it. In New Zealand it overgrows mussels and aquaculture equipment, but has not had quite such a devastating effect on the ecology as anticipated.

It is in the Central Bobonong census district. As of 2001 it had a population of 4,396. The village is northwest of the privately owned Limpopo- Lipadi Game and Wilderness Reserve, near the South African border. The nearest town is Selebi Phikwe. Origins The village is named after the Tsetsebjwe hill, and lies at the foot of this hill. Tradition holds that the village was settled from Gobojango, and used to be a cattle post called Mokgojwe, which took its name from a perennial spring. Two brothers called Motshabi and Motshegwa were given the duty of patrolling the border with the South African Republic to prevent wild Boers from poaching game. The hill provided an ideal look-out point. A man called Tsetsebjwe died here, and the hill was given his name. A traditional doctor named Moshashane came to join the two brothers, and later he became a priest of the Protestant United Congregational Church of Southern Africa. His relatives and those of the two brothers established the village. Economy A 1983 survey of the Tsetsebjwe area found that there was no permanent surface water, although there was permanent water in the sand beds of most rivers. There were some small earth dams, but they were all dry. The village was supplied by boreholes. The nature of the basement terrain meant that there was not much potential for further groundwater development. The village holds many huge Mowana trees. Many of the people are still engaged in cultivating the fields around the village and raising livestock. The village is less than from the Zanzibar Border Gate on the Limpopo River, an entry point to South Africa. Despite being an important point for transfer of goods between the two countries, the river is only crossed using a drift, and this is not usable in the rainy season. In 2008 the Tsetsebjwe Village Development Committee was calling for construction of a bridge over the river. Community Tsetsebjwe hill was traditionally considered hallowed ground. It could be climbed by anyone as there is no danger or harm related to the hill. The summit was thought to be the grazing place for village goats and other livestock. It was used for fertility ceremonies and for ceremonies to appease the gods and end the dry season. These traditions are no longer followed to the same extent as in the past, and now there are pylons and communications towers on the hill.{klSadimbo} The Eloyi Christian Church was founded in this village in 1955 by Poster Jakoba Keiphile. It has since spread across Botswana and into neighboring countries. At first, Jakobo suffered from religious persecution, since the only church allowed was that of the Congregationalist London Missionary Society. Freedom of religion was established after independence in 1966, and he was able to return to Tsetsebjwe. The village remains the headquarters of the church. In August 2011 the community was in the news when a boy died at the Nyangabwe Referral Hospital in Francistown after being flogged. The cause apparently was a damaged kidney. the boy was sentenced to four cane strokes on the back by the traditional court, the Kgotla, for slapping a schoolmate during an argument. According to the headman of Mogadingwane ward, the boy's mother had preferred corporal punishment to a criminal charge from the police. The police and the Sub-Tribal Authority were in agreement that corporal punishment on a minor was not warranted by customary law. Some prominent musicians have their origin in the village, including Kgwanyape, Marks and the Beat, and the Dinare traditional troupe. Political divisions After a change in electoral boundaries, Tsetsejwe and the nearby village of Moletemane became part of the Tswapong North Constituency while remaining part of the Bobirwa sub-district. Authorities in Bobira have been trying to bring the villages back into the Bobirwa Constituency so that services can be delivered more efficiently. With the increased population, the Bobirwa Constituency would merit two Members of Parliament. During the 2014 general elections Tsetsebjwe went back to vote in Bobirwa.

One of the earliest and most significant artists at Papunya in Australia's Northern Territory in the early 1970s, he was a founding member and inaugural chairman of the Papunya Tula artists company, and pivotal to the establishment of modern Indigenous Australian painting. Life Kaapa was born west of Napperby Station in the 1920s. His father was Kwalapa Tjangala, a senior Aboriginal man who had ritual responsibility for a site known as Warlugulong, which would subsequently be portrayed by several different artists in major paintings such as Warlugulong (1976) and Warlugulong (1977). Kaapa was initiated on Napperby Station, and was a stockman at nearby Mount Riddock Station. Kaapa later worked on a station at Haasts Bluff. While he moved to Papunya in the 1960s, he also was present during the town's construction in the late 1950s. Once settled at Papunya, according to art historian Vivien Johnson, he was a drinker with a reputation as a troublemaker, \\"cattle duffer and grog runner\\". He was also charismatic and smart. White art teacher Geoffrey Bardon, who worked with Kaapa in the early 1970s, recalled him: > Kaapa was not as tall as many of the Anmatjira Aranda but he was very quick > to see what others might not see at all. (I often thought he saw far too > much, and perhaps this was why he drank more than he should.) He always > moved in a fast, deft spring-walk, intense and convoluted as he whispered in > his strange, pressed-together, mixed-up English...Kaapa was very bright, but > very down to earth as well, an extraordinary survivor in a despairing > environment. I remember him particularly for his intense way of seeming to > be everywhere at all times, doing things mysteriously and well. Husband to artist Eunice Napangati, Kaapa was also brother to artist Dinny Nolan Tjampitjinpa. Kaapa died in 1989. Art For many years prior to the 1970s, Kaapa had been using traditional designs to create works of art for sale. These had included wooden carvings and watercolour paintings. In 1971 a local official, Jack Cooke, took six of Kaapa's paintings from Papunya into Alice Springs, entering one of them in a local competition, the Caltex Art Award. On 27 August that picture, Gulgardi, also referred to as Men‚Äôs Ceremony for the Kangaroo, Gulgardi, shared the first prize with a work by Jan Wesley Smith. It was the first work by an Indigenous Australian artist to win a contemporary art award, and the first public recognition of a Papunya painting. Kaapa's paintings were probably the earliest to come out of Papunya and the art movement that subsequently made the settlement famous. Gulgardi was described by the National Gallery of Victoria: \\"Kaapa's work, with its pictorial elements and seductive delicacy of detail, is cultivated to appeal to the western gaze. It also recreates the dramatic spectacle of men participating in ceremony and creates an illusion of the third dimension.\\" Kaapa was one of the senior men of Papunya who brought to Geoffrey Bardon a design they wanted to turn into a mural on the town's school building, and one of five artists who painted it on the school wall. Kaapa's win at the Caltex Awards, and the creation of the mural representing honey ant dreaming, were followed by an explosion of painting activity amongst the men of the community, including Kaapa, Billy Stockman Tjapaltjarri, Mick Namarari Tjapaltjarri, Johnny Warrangkula Tjupurrula, Tim Leura Tjapaltjarri and his brother Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri, and others. Their first major collaborative work was destroyed in 1974 when the school building was repainted. However, a strong art movement was underway, with Kaapa at its centre. When, in 1972, the artists of Papunya decided to found a company to market their works, Kaapa was its inaugural chairman. he also played a role in spreading the movement to Yuendumu. Most of the early works created by individual artists were small; Kaapa was an exception in choosing to use larger timber panels for his compositions. Legacy Kaapa is widely credited as a founder, and sometimes the pivotal figure, in the establishment of contemporary Indigenous Australian art. His paintings can be found in the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Art Gallery of Western Australia, the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery and the National Gallery of Victoria, while the National Museum of Australia also holds a number of his works. Internationally, his work can be found in the Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection of the University of Virginia and the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History. A painting by Kaapa, The Winparrku Serpents, was rendered in tapestry by the Victorian Tapestry Workshop for the Arts Centre Melbourne, and was the first of the Centre's tapestries. Three paintings by Kaapa have been listed on Australia's Movable Cultural Heritage Prohibited Exports Register. Inclusion on the register is confined to \\"objects of exceptional cultural importance, whose export would significantly diminish Australia's cultural heritage\\" and requires a permit to be issued for sale of the item outside Australia.

Left: Fast normal-feathering chick. Right: Delayed-feathering chick carrying sex-linked K gene Delayed- feathering in chickens is a genetically determined delay in the first weeks of feather growing, which occurs normally among the chicks of many chicken breeds and no longer manifests itself once the chicken completes adult plumage. The difference between fast normal feather development and delayed-feathering can be recognized in one-day-old chicks but is always more evident in 10- to 12-day-old chicks. Female chicks have a slightly faster feathering than males. Barely seen in breeds with fast normal-feathering, this characteristic is better observed in breeds with delayed feathering, like Barred Plymouth Rock.Hutt, F.B. Gen√©tica Av√≠cola. Salvat Editores,S.A. 1ra.ed. Espa√±a (1958) Natal down color is not related to feathering speed, but in chickens of full- black adult plumage, chicks normally have shorter natal down than those from breeds of any other plumage color pattern Kabystina, P.A. and Petrov, S. G. The genetics of down lengths in chickens (trans. title) Genetika Selekcija seljsk.-hoz. Zivotn. 1, 321-336, (1935) this shortening being more obvious in the head and back. Feathering growth in the first weeks of life is genetically controlled by a few autosomal genes and a sex-linked gene. Most of the phenotypical variation among breeds can be explained by the sex-linked gene K. Autosomal genes retarding feathering growth are not typical in any particular breed. Because those genes are recessive, they need to be in homozygosity to manifest themselves, but as poultry farmers dislike bad-fledged birds, autosomal genes only subsist in very low frequencies. Contrarily, sex-linked delayed-feathering is very frequent, particularly in meat-type breeds like Brahma, Cornish, Cochin, Rhode Island Red, Wyandotte, Plymouth Rock and Orpington. Sex-linked genetic variation has proven to be very useful for the sex identification of one-day-old chicks in commercial hybrids. Sex-linked feathering Sex-linked feathering is controlled by locus K on the sexual chromosome, with four known alleles in the following dominance order: Kn > Ks > K > k+.McGibbon, W. H. A sex-linked mutation affecting rate of feathering in chickens. Poultry Science 56, 872-875 (1977) =Kn (extremely slow- feathering)= Kn (\\"naked\\") is the most dominant of the allelic series which controls feather growth rate. It is a gene whose action on feather growth is quite extreme. Birds carrying this gene are nearly naked during juvenile life and in some cases females remain nearly naked well into adult life. One-day- old chicks lack primary and secondary remiges (they may appear as extremely small pinfeathers, but always shorter than the coverlets).Somes, R. G. Delayed feathering, a third allele at the K locus in the domestic fowl. Journal of Heredity 60, 281-286 (1969) Kn also has other pleiotropic effects, as a reduction in comb size and hypertrophy of the uropygial gland.Somes, R. G. Pleiotropic effects of the sex-linked delayed feathering gene, Kn, in the chicken. Poultry Science 54, 208-216 (1975) =Ks (slow-feathering)= Ks (\\"slow\\") is another dominant allele of the allelic series which controls feather growth rate. In one-day-old chicks primary remiges are shorter than the coverlets. Plumage growing is greatly delayed during the first weeks of juvenile life, but birds of both sexes completely finish plumage growing at twelve weeks of age. This allele has no effect on adult plumage. =K (delayed-feathering)= K is another dominant allele of the allelic series which controls feather growth rate. One-day-old chicks have primary remiges and coverlets of the same length (see Figure 2B). In 8- to 12-day-old chicks rectrices are not yet developed (see Figure 1, chick on the right). Figure 2. Feathering types Diagram of the wing of a one-day-old chick in dorsal view: A fast normal-feathering with the primary remiges (1a) longer than the coverlets (2a). B sex-linked delayed-feathering with the primary remiges (1a) of the same length than the coverlets (2a). C modified delayed-feathering with the primary remiges. (1a) shorter than the coverlets (2a). Feather growth rate is generally slower in K-carriers than in fast normal-feathering birds. But this allele has not any effect on adult plumage.Poultry Science 35,614-616 (1956) Sex-linked delayed-feathering is typical in many meat-type breeds.Somes, R.G.

Storrs Agricultural Experiment Station, The University of Connecticut, Storrs, Bulletin #460, (1981) =k+ (fast normal-feathering)= k+ is the most recessive of the allelic series. One-day-old chicks pure for this allele have the primary remiges evidently longer than the coverlets (see Figure 2A) while 8- to 12-day-old chicks show their rectrices well developed (see Figure 1, chick on the left), and they later complete feather growing long before those chicks carrying K. k+ is responsible for the fast normal- feathering found in most egg-type breeds like Leghorn, Minorca, Ancona and many others. =Practical use of the sex-linked variation= When fast normal- feathering k+k+ cocks are mated to delayed-feathering K hens, the sex of all the descendants can be easily recognized at hatch: resulting female chicks k+ have fast normal-feathering (see Figure 2A) while male chicks Kk+ have delayed-feathering (see Figure 2B and 2C). This happens because female birds have a single Z sexual chromosome, while males carry two,Spillman, W. J. 1909 Barring in Barred Plymouth Rocks. Poultry 5, 708.Smith CA, Roeszler KN, Hudson QJ, Sinclair AH (2007). \\"Avian sex determination: what, when and where?\\". Cytogenet. Genome Res. 117 (1-4): 165‚Äì73 contrarily to what happens in humans, where the male is the heterogametic sex, as occurs in most diploid species.Strickberger, M. W. Genetics. (Chapter 12. Sex determination and sex linkage in diploids) The Macmillan Company, New York / Collier-Macmillan Limited, London, 1968 k+ carrier females are always of the fast normal- feathering type, while heterozygous Kk+ males are of the delayed-feathering type because of the dominance of K over k+. This regularity found practical use in commercial poultry breeding to separate chicks of different sexes in the hatcheries, thus avoiding the inconveniences associated with vent sexing and making easier, faster, harmless and cheaper the sex identification in one- day-old chicks. Through controlled matings and selection, K gene was put into egg-type breeds like White Leghorn, where sex-linked delayed feathering did not originally occur, thus obtaining genetically delayed-feathering female parent breeders to be mated with fast normal-feathering male parent breeders in order to obtain sexable female chicks of the fast normal-feathering type. In meat-type breeds, feather sexing was not so extended to commercial broiler production because resulting poorly-feathered males are very prone to scratches in the skin of the belly, which can discredit carcass quality. After all, unlike egg-laying poultry, meat-type male chicks are not culled, so broiler males can be set apart later, once sexual differences become evident. However, feather-sexing was found to be very useful in the reproduction of female parent stocks, which are usually raised separated by sexes. This way, both sexes of the resulting broiler are of the fast normal-feathering type. Advantages of feather-sexing Identification of sex in one-day-old chicks by feather length has a few advantages over vent sexing:Silverudd, M. 1978 Genetic basis of sexing automation in the fowl. Acta Agricultur√¶ Scandinavica.28, 169-195. :* Special sorting personnel is not required. While vent sexing can only be carried out by highly trained personnel, feather- sexing can be carried out by personnel without training. :* Risk of infection via sexing operative is completely eliminated, especially risk of infection by Escherichia coli due to manipulation. :* There is a lower probability of mistakes: when one-day-old females are sexed for breeding purposes there is less risk of males slipping through. :* Feather sexing is faster than vent sexing, reducing time required to dispatch the chicks out of the hatcheries. One can hatch more chicks per hour because one is not hampered by the drawback of vent sexing operatives being capable of sexing only a restricted number of chicks per hour. :* Some paraphernalia may be dispensed with, such as tables and lamps. :* The cost of sexing is much lower. Disadvantages of feather- sexing Feather-sexing can only be carried out in chicks resulting from the mating of fast normal-feathering males with delayed-feathering females, while vent sexing can be applied to any chicks. This means that feather-sexing cannot be applied to chicks of the same breed, unless geneticists preserve that breed segregating for both types of feathering and birds are strictly controlled for feathering type. The preparation of new breeds to produce feather sexable crosses implies considerable previous genetic work which is completely beyond the means of most poultry farmers. Multifactorial autosomal slow-feathering There are some multifactorial autosomal genes which affect only chicks with delayed-feathering and have no effect on fast normal-feathering chicks, nor on adult plumage. The sole effect of multifactorial slow-feathering is to reduce the length of the primary remiges of one-day-old chicks without a concomitant reduction of the primary coverlets.Poultry Science. 55, 2094 (1976) That is, one-day-old chicks with primary remiges shorter than coverlets carry the K gene of sex-linked delayed- feathering (see Figure 2C). Autosomal T allelic series Contrary to multifactorial slow-feathering genes, which affect only chicks carrying K, the autosomal recessive alleles t (\\"tardy\\") and ts (\\"retarded\\") of the T allelic series affect only those chicks of the fast normal-feathering type.Warren, D. C. Retarded feathering in the fowl. Journal of Heredity 24, 430-434 (1933)Jones, D.G. and Hutt, F. B.Multiple alleles affecting feathering in the fowl. Journal of Heredity 37, 197-205 (1946) The dominance order is T (normal) > ts (\\"retarded\\") > t (\\"tardy\\"). =\\"Retarded\\" tsts chicks= Fast normal- feathering one-day-old chicks have six primary remiges and at least another six secondary remiges (see Figure 3A). While \\"retarded\\" tsts one-day-old chicks have normal primary remiges but only the first three (external) secondary remiges. At 10 days of age, differences between normal and \\"retarded\\" chicks are even more evident. \\"Retarded\\" chicks show the first three or four primary remiges of normal length, with each new feather being shorter than the preceding one (see Figure 3B). At three weeks of age, \\"retarded\\" chicks have even fewer primary remiges than normal chicks, and only the first three secondary remiges reach the same length as primary remiges. Figure 3. Effect of autosomal genes of T series on 10-day-old chicks. (A) Normal-feathering, with a T‚àí genotype. (B) \\"Retarded\\"-feathering, with tsts genotype. (C) \\"Tardy\\"-feathering, with tt genotype. =\\"Tardy\\" tt chicks= \\"Tardy\\" tt chicks are more abnormal than \\"retarded\\" chicks. They show normal primary remiges at hatch, but lack secondary remiges. At ten days of age they still lack rectrices and show small or no development of secondary remiges (see Figure 3C). Rectrices do not appear until at least eight weeks of age. However, adult plumage is normal. Displastic remiges There is an autosomal recessive gene dr which affects remiges and rectrices. Between the 8th and 28th day the feather follicles on several remiges and rectrices become enlarged and blood filled. The tissue of the developing feather becomes necrotic, and these feathers are soon lost.Poultry Science 59, 1667 (1980) References Bird anatomy Feathers Aviculture Poultry Chickens ","title":"Delayed feathering in chickens"},{"id":"37040252","text":"Dragon Knight („Éâ„É©„Ç¥„É≥„Éä„Ç§„Éà) is a fantasy-themed eroge role-playing video game and the original entry in the Dragon Knight franchise that was originally developed and published by ELF Corporation in 1989.

Bug being released from dummy egg after sucking blood from breeding bird.  Methods Since 1980 all chicks have been ringed and breeding success estimated. Since 1992, all fledglings (more than 5000 so far) also get a passive transponder inserted, identifying them individually.Becker, P. H., and H. Wendeln. 1997.

Oikos 117:60-68 An automatic antenna recording system identifies individual terns when they return to the breeding site each season, without birds having to be trapped. Antennas are distributed in prominent places around the colonies and also placed around nests to identify breeding partners. Scales are also distributed around the colony, to record individual weights throughout the season. This system collects data on arrival dates, body weights, breeding partners and breeding success of hundreds of individuals each breeding season with minimal disturbance. These life histories provide important information on the population ecology of long-lived birds. Terns tend to improve with age. Older birds arrive at the breeding site earlier and lay their eggs earlier than their younger counterparts.Ezard, T. H. G., P. H. Becker, and T. Coulson. 2007. Correlations between age, phenotype, and individual contribution to population growth in common terns. Ecology 88:2496-2504.Becker, P. H., T. Dittmann, J.-D. Ludwigs, B. Limmer, S. C. Ludwig, C.

Reproductive improvement and senescence in a long-lived bird. PNAS:1-6 Despite senescence, birds that reach very old age have the highest life-time reproductive success. Physiological analyses of hormones and other blood parameters, as well as genetic analyses are also performed at this colony. Blood samples of breeding birds are taken without trapping, as this reduces stress, which could change blood parameters, for example by increasing stress hormones. This is done using Mexican triatomine blood-sucking bugs (Dipetalogaster maxima), that are placed hungry into a hollowed-out dummy egg, which is placed into the nest of the brooding bird. The bug is able to suck blood through small holes in the wall of the dummy egg. The blood is subsequently extracted from the bug and analysed.Bauch, C., S. Kreutzer, and P. Becker. 2010.

He established the daily Soeara Kalimantan in 1930. It was he who brought news of Indonesia's unilateral declaration of independence to Borneo.  Early life  Hamidhan was born in Rantau, Tapin, South Kalimantan on 25 February 1909. He studied in a Europeese Lagere School in Samarinda before going to Genrum MULO in Batavia (modern day Jakarta). Formal education was rare at the time for natives who were not of noble descent, especially in Borneo.  Career  = Before independence = By 1927 Hamidhan had begun working in journalism, joining the editorial board of the newspaper Perasaan Kita in Samarinda; he also joined the board of Bintang Timoer in Batavia. By 1929 he was heading Bendahara Borneo; he would lead several further newspapers in the 1930s and 1940s, including Soeara Kalimantan (1930s), Kalimantan Raya (1942), and Borneo Shimbun (1945). Soeara Kalimantan, which Hamidhan established on 23 March 1930, was located in Banjarmasin; several other native journalists followed his lead by establishing their own publications.Sastra Indonesia Modern di Kalimantan Selatan Sebelum Perang (1930‚Äì1945) However, Hamidhan was imprisoned several times for his writings opposing the Dutch colonial government; this included two months in Cipinang in 1930, six weeks in Banjarmasin in 1932, and a further six months in Banjarmasin in 1936. During the Japanese occupation, Soera Kalimantan offices were destroyed during a Japanese offensive on Banjarmasin in February 1942. On 5 March Hamidhan began publishing the daily Kalimantan Raya. Kalimantan Raya was established on orders from the Japanese, and by May control had shifted to Japanese journalists from Asahi Shimbun and renamed Borneo Simboen. Hamidhan remained as an editor and was under intense pressure from the occupation forces, receiving several warnings for his writings. = Post-independence = In 1945 Hamidhan was chosen by the Japanese as a representative of Borneo at the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (Panitia Persiapan Kemerdekaan Indonesia, or PPKI) in Jakarta (renamed during the occupation). Before leaving, he spoke with local figures regarding their hopes and aspirations for an independent nation. When Indonesia proclaimed its independence on 17 August 1945, Hamidhan was one of the witnesses. He later wrote Sekitar Mukaddimah UUD 1945: Untuk Memperlengkap Kebenaran Sejarah (Regarding the Constitution of 1945: To Complete History's Recordings), which dealt with his experiences around the period and decried claims that there was conflict over parts of the constitution relating to God's role in the country. On 18 August the PPKI had its first meeting, where President Sukarno indicated nine members as a subcommittee tasked with deciding urgent matters regarding the nascent country's policing, defence, subdivision, and economy. The following day Oto Iskandar di Nata held a meeting where he offered governorship of Borneo to Hamidhan, an offer the latter refused. Hamidhan instead suggested Pangeran Muhammad Noor, who was in Java at the time and later became the government's selection. With A.A. Rivai, his younger brother on 24 August Hamidhan went to Borneo to bring news of Indonesia's independence. This he published in Borneo Shimbun, including the entirety of the proclamation, the constitution, and an announcement of Pangeran Muhammad Noor's selection as governor. He also helped establish branches of the National Party of Indonesia, People's Security Body, and governing boards. After the Dutch‚ÄìIndonesian Round Table Conference in 1949 Hamidhan renamed Soeara Kalimantan as Indonesia Merdeka. He sold the publication in 1961, disheartened by the increasing lack of press freedom. His nephew Fachrudin Mohani then offered him two hotels to manage, Hotel Banyuwangi (Banyuwangi) and Hotel Wisma Andhika (Surabaya), a job offer which Hamidhan accepted. He continued this work, visiting Borneo ever few months, until 1975.  Personal life  Hamidhan was married to Siti Aisyah, with whom he had seven children and eleven grandchildren. A biography on him, entitled H.A.A. Hamidhan: Pejuang dan Perintis Pers di Kalimantan (H.A.A. Hamidhan: Fighter and Press Leader in Kalimantan) was written in 1987.

The monument is an obelisk about two metres high. The inscription reads: \\"To the defenders of Bauska against the second Soviet occupation on July 28 ‚Äì September 14, 1944\\", followed by \\"Latvia should be a Latvian state\\", a quotation from a speech made by Karlis Ulmanis, Latvia's last pre-war president. The monument was built with private donations on land given by the municipal council. It was unveiled in the centre of Bauska in the presence of local officials and a lawmaker. The monument is controversial due to allegations that it glorifies Nazism and its Latvian collaborators. Historical background The monument in 2015 The first Soviet occupation of Latvia from 1940 to 1941 was replaced by the Nazi occupation, 1941 to 1944. In 1944, the Red Army launched the Baltic Offensive towards the Gulf of Riga. A volunteer corps of town inhabitants was formed to protect the town against the Red Army. The volunteer forces, numbering about 300, and outnumbered tens to one, managed to hold back the offensive for six weeks, from 28 July to 14 September 1944. The Soviet bombardment of 11‚Äì14 September 1944 destroyed 100 buildings in the town and damaged more than 300 ‚Äì destroying more than one third of Bauska. Most of the defenders died in the desperate fighting. The initiator of the monument, Egils Helmanis, the grandson of one of the volunteer defenders of Bauska, stated: Controversy Criticism centers on allegations that the monument glorifies Nazism. The Russian embassy in Riga condemned the unveiling of the monument, alleging the Latvians were Nazis, saying that: The Foreign Ministry of Belarus called erecting the monument a \\"clear desecration of the memory of the fallen,\\" alleging the Latvian Legion were criminals who killed Belarusian partisans and civilians.–ó–∞—è–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª—å–Ω–∏–∫–∞ —É–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –∏–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏–∏ ‚Äì –ø—Ä–µ—Å—Å-—Å–µ–∫—Ä–µ—Ç–∞—Ä—è –ú–ò–î –ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ—è –°–∞–≤–∏–Ω—ã—Ö –≤ —Å–≤—è–∑–∏ —Å —É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∫–æ–π –≤ –õ–∞—Ç–≤–∏–∏ –º–æ–Ω—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –ø—Ä–µ—Å—Ç—É–ø–Ω–∏–∫–∞–º –∏–∑ –ª–∞—Ç—ã—à—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ª–µ–≥–∏–æ–Ω–∞ –°–° The Foreign Minister of Israel has expressed a protest on behalf of the government at a meeting with the Latvian Foreign Minister.

It was abolished on 19 June 2002. The last execution, by shooting, took place on 29 January 1981, and the two last death sentences were pronounced on 11 October 2001. Montenegro is bound by the following international conventions prohibiting capital punishment (dates of ratification are given in parentheses): Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (6 September 2001), as well as Protocols No. 6 and No. 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights (3 March 2004). According to Art. 26 of the Montenegrin Constitution (2007): ‚ÄûIn Montenegro, capital punishment is forbidden‚Äù.  History  = Montenegro, 1798-1914 = Until 1851, Montenegro was a theocracy, ruled by an Orthodox Bishop and a Senate, composed of representatives of Montenegrin tribes, which enjoyed a full autonomy. The first written law was passed in 1789 (and amended in 1803), during the rule of Bishop Peter I. It prescribed the death penalty for murder and treason and allowed three modes of execution: hanging, shooting and stoning.Zakonik ob≈°ƒçi crnogorski i brdski.

Sabrana dela [Collected Works], XVIII. Belgrade. p. 656. Although not prescribed by law, capital punishment was also applied to thieves. According to historical sources, ‚Äûa thief was hanged and a murderer shot‚Äú in 1831. In 1839/1840, ‚Äûabout 20 criminals‚Äú were executed.Popoviƒá, Petar (1951). Crna Gora u doba Petra I i Petra II [Montenegro in the times of Petar I and Peter II], Belgrade. p. 297. After Montenegro became a secular Princedom, a new penal code was adopted in 1855 (The Prince Danilo's Code). It prescribed capital punishment for some 18 offenses, including murder, treason, offences against the dignity of the Prince (lese-majesty), various forms of theft, and refusal to pay tax. A man who kills his wife and/or her lover having found them in an act of adultery (in flagrante) was exempt from all punishment. The legal mode of execution was shooting, but only for men. Women could not be shot (as it would ‚Äûsoil the rifles‚Äú), but were to be hanged, drowned or stoned instead. Executions of women were extremely rare ‚Äì one documented case involved a woman stoned for murdering her husband in 1854.Bojoviƒá, Jovan (1982). Zakonik knjaza Danila [Prince Danilo's Code], Titograd, p.49. The first modern Penal Code, adopted in 1906, prescribed capital punishment for more than twenty offenses.Kriviƒçni zakonik za Knja≈æevinu Crnu Goru [Penal Code for the Princedom of Montenegro], Cetinje 1906. Execution was by shooting, performed by a firing squad of ten soldiers. The true number of death sentences and executions prior to 1914 is not known, but it was small: on the average, one or two executions per year. An exception to this were two political trials in 1908 and 1909, when 13 persons accused of conspiring against the government were sentenced to death (nine were executed). = Yugoslavia, 1918‚Äì1941 = When Yugoslavia was created in 1918, different legal systems remained in force in different parts of the new country. In the north-western provinces (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia and Vojvodina), executions were by hanging in an enclosed space with restricted public attendance. In the remainder of the country (Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro and Macedonia), executions were by shooting and in public. When a single Penal Code was introduced for the whole country (1929), hanging remained the only legal mode of execution, with the exception of sentences passed by military courts, which were executed by shooting.Jankoviƒá, Ivan (2012). Na belom hlebu: Smrtna kazna u Srbiji, 1804‚Äì2002 [On white bread diet: The death penalty in Serbia 1804-2002]. Belgrade. Ch.8-10 Crimes punished by death were mostly murder and robbery leading to death, as well as terrorism. According to the official statistics, there were 14 death sentences and 5 executions in Montenegro from 1920 to 1940 (In the same period, in the whole of Yugoslavia there were 904 sentences and 291 executions).Statistiƒçki godi≈°njaci Kraljevine SHS / Jugoslavije [Statistical Yearbooks of the Kingdom SHS / Yugoslavia]. Belgrade. 1921-1941. = Yugoslavia, 1945‚Äì1991 = In the first years after WWII, death sentences were passed in large numbers daily on collaborationists and war criminals, but also on the ‚Äûenemies of the people‚Äú, i.e. all those who opposed the new communist regime. There are no reliable data, but it seems likely that in Yugoslavia until 1951 there were as many as 10,000 death sentences, a majority of which were executed. In Montenegro, there may have been several hundred death sentences, approximately two thirds of which were executed. In addition to political offences, capital crimes included the theft of the government property, as well as aggravated murder and robbery. Until 1959, executions were either by shooting or by hanging, as determined by the sentence of the court in each individual case, although hangings were considered as an aggravated form and were used less frequently. In the first post-war years, executions of major war criminals were often public. After 1950, the number of death sentences fell sharply. According to the official statistics, from 1950 to 1958 there were 229 death sentences in all of Yugoslavia, while in Montenegro there were only between ten and twenty. The 1959 reforms resulted in a less strict system of criminal justice. Number of capital offences was reduced and capital punishment was abolished for property offences. Hanging was abolished and the only legal mode of execution remained shooting, performed by a platoon of eight policemen, only half of whom had rifles loaded with live ammunition. Executions could not be performed publicly. From 1959 to 1991, there were, on average, two or three executions per year in Yugoslavia. In the same 32-year period, there were fewer than ten executions in Montenegro. The last execution in Montenegro took place in Kotor on 29 January 1981. The person executed was one Dragi≈°a Ristiƒá, sentenced to death for raping and murdering a minor. = Montenegro after 1991 = From April 1992, Serbia was a part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which consisted of two federal units ‚Äì Serbia and Montenegro. From 1991 to 2002, Montenegrin courts passed 8 death sentences, none of which had been executed. The two last death sentences were passed by the Higher Court in Podgorica on Slavko Deviƒá and Rade Arsoviƒá, convicted of murder.  Abolition  = Early attempts = In 1906, a pamphlet against capital punishment was published in Cetinje, and in 1907 the minister of justice informed the Parliament that it was the Prince‚Äôs wish to have the death penalty abolished in Montenegro, except for treason. However, no amendments to the Penal Code were made in the Parliament and the capital punishment remained in force. = Partial abolition, 1992 = Constitution of FR Yugoslavia (which consisted of Serbia and Montenegro), adopted on 25 April 1992, abolished capital punishment for federal crimes (including genocide, war crimes, political and military offences), but the federal units kept the right to prescribe capital punishment for crimes under their jurisdiction (murder and robbery). In the drafting of the Constitution, the proposal to abolish capital punishment came from the Montenegrin members of the Drafting Commission. = Final abolition, 2002 = On 19 June 2002, the Montenegrin Parliament amended the Penal Code by deleting from it all references to capital punishment. As was stressed in the parliamentary debate, a paramount motive for this abolition was the desire of the then FR Yugoslavia to join the Council of Europe.

Life He was born in the manse at Half Morton in rural Dumfriesshire the fourth son of Rev Walter Smith was Free Church of Scotland minister in the parish. He had several talented siblings, including the mycologist, Annie Lorrain Smith who worked informally at the British Museum. His brother Walter Smith became a professor of philosophy at Lake Forest College in Illinois whilst another brother, William George Smith, became a lecturer in psychology. Lorrain Smith was educated locally then at George Watson's College in Edinburgh. He studied for a general Arts, graduating with an MA in 1893 and allowing him to then study medicine at the University of Edinburgh where he graduated with an MB ChB in 1889. He then studied pathology as a postgraduate under Prof John Lucas Walker at the University of Cambridge. He became a Demonstrator under Professor Charles Smart Roy who recommended that he follow his studies at the universities of Strasbourg under Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen. He spent some time at Copenhagen where he studied techniques for analysing gases in blood in Christian Bohr's laboratory before moving to teach at the Queen's College, Belfast, becoming a professor in 1901. In 1904 he was elected President of the Ulster Medical Association. In 1904 he became Professor of Pathology at the University of Manchester and in 1912 moved to the University of Edinburgh to replace Prof William Smith Greenfield. During the First World War he helped to introduce the antiseptic \\"Eusol\\" (Edinburgh University Solution) and suggested the idea of using charcoal in gas masks. Lorrain Smith worked with John Scott Haldane on respiration particularly the transport of oxygen by the blood. The pulmonary condition of intoxication due to excess oxygen or oxygen toxicity is sometimes called \\"Lorrain Smith effect\\". He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London on 6 May 1909. In 1919 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir William Turner, Cargill Gilston Knott, Sir Edmund Taylor Whittaker and Arthur Robinson. He died on 18 April 1931. A memorial ceremony was held at the University of Edinburgh read by Principal David Cairns. He was cremated at Warriston Crematorium.

No copy pre-1866 is known to have survived. From 1866 (or earlier) until December 1888, the paper was called the Telegraph and St Kilda, Prahran and South Yarra Guardian. From January 1889 until 7 December 1902, the paper was known simply as the Prahran Telegraph. From 13 December 1902 the banner head read the Prahran Telegraph, with which is incorporated the St Kilda Advertiser and the Malvern Argus. The newspaper was probably started by Howard Spensley, who sold it within several years to William Osment. The preceding Prahran and St Kilda Advertiser was first published by John Hartley in 1857, and continued until at least 1861. The Osment family owned the Telegraph until 1882, and again from 1895-1905. Henry Osment was prominent in local affairs and on Prahran Council, serving as Mayor for 1888/89. In general, the paper was published weekly, though at various times the frequency was increased to twice weekly. On 5 January 1889‚Äîthe same issue in which the banner head was changed (see above) -- the paper moved to bi-weekly publication, declaring itself \\"... the first bi-weekly suburban newspaper ever issued in Australia\\". In 2012 microfilm copies of the newspaper held at the State Library of Victoria began being digitised and made available in the National library of Australia's Trove newspaper search repository.  Location and ownership  Various sources confirm the paper as starting in 1860, with Howard Spensley sometimes identified as the first owner. However, ratebook research shows that Spensley took over the printery office from John Hartley only in 1862, so it is possible that Hartley in fact started the Telegraph. Alternatively, it is also possible that Spensley was publishing the Telegraph from another address from 1860-1861, but he has not as yet been noted in ratebooks or directories. An obituary for Spensley published in the Telegraph (23 August 1902) referred to Spensley somewhat enigmatically as \\"... practically the founder of this journal, being the first editor and proprietor\\". John Hartley was publishing the Prahran and St Kilda Advertiser from offices in Chapel Street in 1857. He is listed in the ratebooks from 1857-1861 at the address subsequently occupied by Spensley. The property is listed as a printery in 1858 and 1860, but not in 1859. The Sands & McDougall directorySands & McDougall Directory of Victoria, 1862-1974 lists the Prahran Advertiser Office (Goulding & Co) at this address in 1862, and the following year, Prahran Telegraph and Advertiser under Spensley. Perhaps publication of the papers overlapped at that printery in 1862 and 1863. Note that Goulding & Co were the publishers of the St. Kilda Chronicle and Prahran, South Yarra, Windsor, Brighton, & South District Advertiser from issue No. 1 in August 1858 until at least August 1861, the latest known extant edition of that paper. During that period, the paper was published from Barkly Street, Junction, St Kilda. In the 1864 ratebooks, W.H. Osment, a printer, is shown 4 doors south of Spensley's printing office in Chapel Street, not far south of Greville Street. In 1865, the printery is shown in the ratebooks at Osment's rented property, with Spensley having moved on. This is consistent with J.B. Cooper‚Äôs History of Prahran (1924)https://archive.org/details/historyofprahran00coop p. 279 which claims that Spensley still owned the Telegraph in 1864. Note however Henry Osment's obituary (Prahran Telegraph 3 March 1906): \\"... In March 1862, Mr W.H. Osment (deceased's father) acquired the goodwill and copyright of the Prahran Telegraph, which subsequently fell into his son's possession\\". By 1865, the Prahran Telegraph occupied 223 Chapel Street, where it remained until 1910 when it moved to new premises in King Street, Prahran. It was published from there until at least 1930.City of Prahran rate books, 1856-1994 In 1866, Osment's printery is shown two doors further south again along Chapel Street, south of Coulson's corn store. This appears to be the location of the Telegraph office from that time until the move to King Street in 1910. In the 1870s, the office was numbered as 101 Chapel Street, two doors south of the Telegraph Hotel. It was later renumbered as 223. It is shown on the MMBW plan c. 1896, with the office opposite and slightly north of Anchor Place, and with the printing room set back behind the shopfronts of 219-223. The Osment family owned and published the paper until 1882, when it was sold to Crabb and Brotherton. Aubrey Brotherton left the company in 1887 to take over a rival paper, the Prahran Chronicle. In 1891, the paper was owned and published by John May Yelland, with Yelland \\"proprietor in his own right and as Administrator of estate of James Halls Crab [sic] deceased\\". Yelland was Crabb's brother-in-law.Prahran Telegraph, 18 Nov 1893 The Osment family purchased the Telegraph again in March 1895 from Crabb & Yelland, retaining ownership until Arthur Tilley took over on 22 Oct 1905. Brotherton returned as owner and publisher of the Telegraph on 22 October 1910, and remained in that position until at least 1928. (page 65). For a photo of the paper's second site (in King Street, Prahran), see p. 69\\\\. Detail on this photo shows a sign on the office 'Established 1860-1910', confirming the starting year. Another owner of the Telegraph was Aubrey Brotherton. From 1882-87 this was in partnership with James Crabb, before Brotherton left to take over a rival paper, the Prahran Chronicle (published c. 1879-1919). In 1910, he returned as owner and publisher of the Telegraph, and continued until at least 1928.

Its founders included engineering and construction companies, intending to promote the Severn Barrage. It was originally named Corlan Hafren, which means Severn Group in Welsh. it comprises four companies, Arup, Mott MacDonald, HalcrowThe Severn Barrage, Regional Vision, October 2012, Corlan Hafren and architects Marks Barfield. Halcrow is lead company. Associated companies and persons involved in the project include Atkins, Rolls-Royce, accountants KPMG and Roger Falconer. Journalist Christopher Booker of The Sunday Telegraph noted in August 2012 that former Conservative environment secretary John Gummer is a former director of the company. one sixth of shares were held by Sancroft International, which is owned by the Gummer family. The House of Commons Energy and Climate Change Select Committee examined Hafren Power's proposal in 2013, coming to the conclusion: In 2013 and 2014 several executives and the CEO resigned. Shortly after, Wales Online reported Hafren Power as defunct.  Severn Barrage  In 2010 the company revived proposals for the Severn Barrage from Cardiff to Weston-super-Mare and in 2011 it presented them to the Department of Energy and Climate Change. Former shadow Welsh Secretary Peter Hain and company representatives met with Prime Minister David Cameron in July 2012 to promote the project. The company said that the project will not require public funding and expected to attract investment from venture capital firms and pension funds. It had sought funding from sovereign wealth funds, stating that expressions of interest have been received from such funds and other investors in Kuwait, Qatar, the UK and elsewhere. Hafren Power stated the scheme would require ¬£25 billion of capital investment, and estimated power costs were about ¬£100 per MWh for the first 30 years, and ¬£20 per MWh thereafter.

Hekimoƒülu's body is on the right. Hekimoƒülu ƒ∞brahim (died 26 April 1913), known by his epithet Hekimoƒülu (\\"son of a physician\\" in Turkish), was an Ottoman outlaw and a folk hero. He was born in Fatsa, Ottoman Empire (today's Turkey). Early years According to the Turkish historians Mithat Sertoƒülu and Ayhan Y√ºksel, Hekimoƒülu ƒ∞brahim grew up in a farming family in the Yassƒ±ta≈ü village of Fatsa.Sertoƒülu, Mithat - \\"Kahramanlar Kahramanƒ± Hekimoƒülu\\" ƒ∞stanbul 1983.Y√ºksel, Ayhan - \\"E≈ükƒ±ya Hekimoƒülu\\" Tombak, Sayƒ± : 35 (Aralƒ±k 2000), s. 72 - 75 In the early 1900s, while he was working for the local Chveneburi (Muslim Georgian) landowner, Sefer Agha, he fell in love with his daughter, Fadime. Soon after, Fadime and ƒ∞brahim began to meet in secret. One day, a local Chveneburi man, Yusuf, saw the two lovers together and told them their meeting violated the social and religious code of the Chveneburi community, where, in those days, a single girl was forbidden from speaking to a man who was not a close relative. Following Yusuf's disclosure of the love affair between Hekimoƒülu and Fadime, an animosity by Chveneburi people towards the neighbouring Turks developed. To avenge the community honour, a group of Chveneburi men, including Yusuf, tried to kill Hekimoƒülu, but he escaped their trap, killing one of the Chveneburi men in the process with his soon-to-become famous M1874 Turkish Peabody-Martini rifle ().Y√ºksel, Ayhan - E≈ükƒ±ya Hekimoƒülu ƒ∞brahim'in 'Aynalƒ± Martin' T√ºfeƒüi, H√ºrriyet Tarih 27 Kasƒ±m 2002, s. 20 - 21. Fearing an unfair trial, Hekimoƒülu refused to surrender himself to the local authority in Fatsa and took refuge in the mountains, becoming an outlaw. Outlaw and folk hero Led by Hekimoƒülu, a gang of outlaws conducted a campaign of robberies and raids against any landowner or community leader who was rumoured to be mistreating the local population. Hekimoƒülu and his gang were said to share some of their bounty with the poor (√† la Robin Hood). This led Hekimoƒülu to attain a folk hero status and he was given the title \\"the hero of the all heroes\\" () by the local people. His gang activities were a significant factor in raising the ethnic tension between the Chveneburi and Turkish communities in Fatsa and in the wider Sanjak (sub-province) of Janik. On 15 December 1908, a telegram was sent from Fatsa to the Minister of the Interior of the Ottoman Empire in Istanbul, the capital, requesting assistance in capturing Hekimoƒülu, but due to the assistance and shelter given to him by local Turkish villages, authorities were unsuccessful in capturing him and Hekimoƒülu responded by increasing his attacks on the Chveneburi. =Death= The Ottoman Council of State () rejected Hekimoƒülu's requests for a pardon, and on 26 April 1913, he was killed along with his friend Alan Osman in a shootout with the authorities in his home village of Yassƒ±ta≈ü in Fatsa. His death was documented by an American journalist. Legacy Hekimoƒülu is recalled in Turkey as a folk hero, almost of legend, who fought against injustice and oppression.

Bour's surface, leaving out the points with r < 0.5 to show the self-crossings more clearly. In mathematics, Bour's minimal surface is a two-dimensional minimal surface, embedded with self-crossings into three- dimensional Euclidean space. It is named after Edmond Bour, whose work on minimal surfaces won him the 1861 mathematics prize of the French Academy of Sciences.. Description Bour's surface crosses itself on three coplanar rays, meeting at equal angles at the origin of the space. The rays partition the surface into six sheets, topologically equivalent to half-planes; three sheets lie in the halfspace above the plane of the rays, and three below. Four of the sheets are mutually tangent along each ray. Equation The points on the surface may be parameterized in polar coordinates by a pair of numbers (r,Œ∏). Each such pair corresponds to a point in three dimensions according to the parametric equationsWeisstein, Eric W. \\"Bour's Minimal Surface.\\" From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BoursMinimalSurface.html :x(r,\\\\theta) = r\\\\cos(\\\\theta) - (1/2)r^2 \\\\cos(2\\\\theta) :y(r,\\\\theta) = -r\\\\sin(\\\\theta)(r \\\\cos(\\\\theta) + 1) :z(r,\\\\theta) = (4/3)r^{3/2} \\\\cos(3\\\\theta/2).

She is the Founder and Executive Chairman of Beirut Institute and Columnist for The National. She served as Columnist, Senior Diplomatic Correspondent, and New York Bureau Chief for the London-based Al-Hayat daily for 28 years. She is well-known internationally as a Middle Eastern female journalist, and has received awards for her career achievements. Dergham sees herself as an interpreter of the Middle Eastern and American cultures for her two audiences. Early life Raghida Dergham was born to Nabih and Bahia Dergham in Beirut, Lebanon, in 1953. Her family is Druze in religion. Dergham moved to the United States in 1970 when she was seventeen, and worked her way through college at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh where she studied creative writing and journalism, and graduated in 1974. Career Raghida Dergham began her career in journalism at the age of fifteen. She and her friend Hanan al-Shaykh, who is a Lebanese author, would publish their articles in the Beirut newspapers. Dergham published articles in (magazine) and (newspaper supplement). Dergham was first hired professionally as a journalist in Boston, beginning her career in radio in 1974 and hosting a program Haneen (Translated: Nostalgia), and from this start, she became a foreign correspondent in New York in 1976. In 1989, she joined Al-Hayat, an independent daily Arabic newspaper, and began to cover the United Nations. Dergham is now the senior diplomatic correspondent for Al-Hayat and she writes a weekly column on international political affairs. In addition to being a regular political commentator on CNN, she has made frequent appearances in other international TV and radio broadcast forums. Dergham's work has been featured in many major publications including: The New York Times, Washington Post, Gulf News, LA Times, Newsweek International, and several others. In 1997, she served as the president of the United Nations Correspondents Association. She was influenced by the interviewing style of Oriana Fallaci while rejecting her politics and views. Notable journalism assignments Raghida Dergham conducted an exclusive interview with Ramzi Youssef who was behind the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Dergham is known for her interviews of international leaders and public figures. She has interviewed many notable figures including: *US President George W. Bush, Secretaries of State Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, General David Petraeus *President Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines *King Abdullah and the late King Hussein of Jordan *Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf *Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak *Palestinian Presidents Mahmoud Abbas and Yasser Arafat *Iraqi President Jalal Talabani *Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh *President Omar Al-Bashir of Sudan *Lebanon‚Äôs Prime Minister Fouad Siniora She covered the US- Soviet Summits in the 1980s between US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev. PBS Caught in the Crossfire Raghida Dergham was one of three Arab-Americans featured in the PBS documentary Caught in the Crossfire: Arab Americans in Wartime which aired on September 4, 2002. Trial for treason The Lebanese government suspended her Lebanese passport while she was in Beirut on assignment covering UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on 19 June 2000. Later, Lebanon said it had taken action as a result of a May 2000 panel discussion, in which Dergham participated, that included a representative from the Israeli government. The panel discussion was sponsored by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy in Washington, D.C. Dergham was subsequently charged with \\"dealing with the enemy,\\" a crime in Lebanon, and in June 2001 a trial was held in Lebanon. The Committee to Protect Journalists responded: \\"We view the treason case against Dergham as part of a pattern of state harassment intended to punish an independent journalist for doing her job. The government of Lebanon has shown contempt for press freedom and the free public debate that is essential in a democratic society. The charges should be dropped, and Dergham should be free to work without further harassment.\\" Dergham responded to the verdict, \\"I've spent all my life explaining a point of view. When it's right, I defend it. I thought they would honor me. Instead, they put me in a military trial, charged me with 'dealing with the enemy,' which is treason. After they have annulled my passport. For what? For debating an Israeli within an open forum? It's like a knife over my head.\\" Awards In 2017, she was named \\"Arab Woman of the Year\\" for her achievements in Journalism. Arabian Business named Dergham one of its 100 Most Powerful Arab Women in 2011 and 2016 issues. In 2010, the New Arab Woman Forum presented its award to her for being an \\"exceptional woman\\" and making a contribution to society. She received the 2005 NAAP-NY Achievement Award from the Network of Arab-American Professionals of New York to honor her professional integrity in journalism. Dergham is in SUNY's Hall of Fame as a distinguished alumna, and she received an honorary Doctorate of Letters from SUNY in 2003. She serves on the board for the International Women's Media Foundation. She is a member of the International Media Council of the World Economic Forum.

In an election, sincere voting is formally choosing the voter's most preferred candidate. It might initially seem that all voting would be sincere, since voting is a method for individuals to contribute to a group decision by expressing an opinion. However, the design of many voting systems prevents full expression of voter opinion. As a result, voters may attempt to prevent undesired outcomes rather than support positive outcomes. By definition, insincere voting is when a voter supports an undesired outcome to prevent an even less desired outcome. Elections with several candidates Elections allowing only one vote among more than two candidates often require a decision between voting sincerely or insincerely. If the voter's most preferred candidate is unlikely to win, the voter often chooses between the two leading candidates by the lesser of two evils principle. However, vote pairing is another option that can allow two insincere voters to vote sincerely without changing the runoff outcome between the two leading candidates. For example, in the United States Presidential Election, if a Democrat and Republican in the same voting district both agree to vote for third party candidates, they will achieve the same effect in the Democrat/Republican runoff and will also gain the opportunity to vote sincerely for third party candidates. Voting systems Voting behavior in complex voting systems tends to develop similarly high levels of strategic complexity.

The stream's course A minor spring in The Mill Field in Mill Hill is probably a source of a tributary of Burnt Oak Brook, but the brook itself is first visible in Simmonds Mead Open Space, a small green open space at the junction of Watford Way and Lawrence Street. The stream then again passes through an underground pipe to re-emerge in the north-west corner of Lyndhurst Park. It goes along The Meads and under Deansbrook Road to pass through Abbots Road Allotments into Watling Park. On exiting from the park it goes underground to join the Silk Stream near Silkstream Park. Ecological value The section of the brook between Lyndhurst Park and Watling Park is part of the Silk Stream and Burnt Oak Brook Site of Borough Importance for Nature Conservation, Grade II. Downstream of Lyndhurst Park, it passes through a narrow belt of mown grass which is left wild close to the brook, with scattered trees and common wild flowers on the banks. In Watling Park the stream mainly follows a natural course and crack-willows, hawthorn and alder form a woodland corridor for wildlife. Grey wagtails often forage among the pebbles of the brook.

Women's football in Israel is gaining popularity but female players often play abroad to improve their skills. Some of the barriers that prevent the sport from growing are prejudice against women for playing soccer. Other main causes are lack of budgets, sponsors and proper budget management. As in any competitive sports field lack of transparency is always a big barrier on its own and creates a hidden competition among the athletes. The Israeli women's football suffers from years of neglection from the authorities and was always the last in terms of priority. The main effort to improve and establish a future for this sport was in the hand of the managers and private people that usually were struggling alone to collect budget to create youth teams in the different clubs in order to create a future generation. The Israel Football Association (IFA) is the governing body of football in the State of Israel.

The association was dubbed Tayo (\\"Quality\\") on account of the generally favorable reputation that his administration earned during its brief tenure.Former PM Farmajo Forms New Political Party According to Mohamed, the party's primary agenda revolves around delivering services to Somalia's general population and encouraging the repatriation of Somali diasporans so as to assist in the ongoing post-conflict reconstruction process. Since stepping down from office, he has reportedly been campaigning in various global destinations to amass support for his new party, including the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Sweden. On April 2, 2012, Maryam Qaasim, the former Minister of Women's Affairs in Mohamed's Cabinet, was elected Chairperson of the TPP. Mohamed is serving as the party's Secretary-General.

He studied from 1903 to 1907 at the University of Vienna and at the University of G√∂ttingen, where he received his PhD under David Hilbert with thesis Oszillationseigenschaften der Eigenfunktionen der Integralgleichung mit definitem Kern und das Jacobische Kriterium der Variationsrechnung. In 1911 he earned his Habilitation qualification at the University of Leipzig with thesis Konforme Abbildung der Oberfl√§che einer r√§umlichen Ecke. He worked next in Leipzig as assistant and privatdocent. In 1914 he was appointed Ausserordentlicher Professor at the University of T√ºbingen, where in 1921 he became professor ordinarius. In World War I, he was from 1916 to 1918 a member of the Deputy General Staff in Berlin. From 1919 to 1921 he declined three academic calls then accepted in 1922 a call to be Ordentlicher Professor at the University of M√ºnster as successor to Leon Lichtenstein. From 1922 to 1926, he was assistant to Maximilian Krafft, with whom he wrote the textbook Elliptischen Funktionen. In 1927 K√∂nig was appointed Ordentlicher Professor and institute director at the University of Jena, where he replaced Paul Koebe. From 1934 to 1943, Friedrich Karl Schmidt and K√∂nig represented pure mathematics in Jena. In 1934 the Saxon Academy of Sciences in Leipzig elected him as a full member. Because both Schmid and K√∂nig were opposed to Nazism, they were involved in disputes over the appointment of new, politically reliable mathematicians at the University of Jena in the Nazi era. After the end of World War II, K√∂nig went to the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t M√ºnchen. At Munich from 1947 to 1950, he was instrumental in offering professorships to Constantin Carath√©odory and Eberhard Hopf. From 1950 to 1955, K√∂nig was Ordentlicher Professor at Munich. In 1953, he was made a full member in the Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften. His doctoral students include Helmut R√∂hrl and Karl-Heinrich Weise, with whom he wrote in 1951 a book on geodesy and cartography Mathematische Grundlagen der h√∂heren Geod√§sie und Kartographie.

It says that the Government of Goa be given certain powers by the Indian Government by amending Article 371I of the Constitution of India. These powers would allow the Government of Goa to enact special legislation to control the private property rights of the Goans and put restrictions on the sale of land by Goans. Unique Culture Protection There are actions initiated both by the Goa Government and some Citizen Groups to further the demand for grant of Special Status Powers. A delegation of the MSSG led By Adv. Antonio Lobo handed over a memorandum to the Chief Minister Mr. Manohar Parrikar. A discussion over the amendment to Article 371 (i) of the Indian Constitution was deliberated upon. The Goa Legislative Assembly unanimously passed a resolution for Grant of Special Status and a delegation led by the Chief Minister of Goa met the Prime Minister to apprise him of the need for Special Status. Among the Citizen Groups, there was Goa Movement for Special Status led by late Mathany Saldanha and Movement for special status for Goa (MSSG). Adv. Antonio Lobo is the Convenor, Prof. Prajal Sakhardande, the Secretary and Mr. Antonio Alvares is the Joint Secretary.  Origins of the Special Status Movement  Goa was a Portuguese colony and Indian government annexed Goa on 19 December 1961. After the invasion, steps were taken by the Indian government to integrate Goans into the Indian Union. Prime Minister Jawarlal Nehru had in 1954 promised to Goans that it is in the interest of the Indian Nation that Portuguese must go and that Goans will not be brought into the Indian Union through Coercion. At an emergency UNSC meet on 18 December 1961, to discuss the Goan crisis, a resolution seeking the withdrawal of the Indian forces out of Goa, was vetoed by the USSR, despite getting majority votes. That night, Mr. C. S. Jha, the Indian Ambassador to the United Nations conceded that it is now the time for all the UN resolutions pertaining to de- colonized territories to come into play. The UNO General Assembly had already adopted a resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 on the granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. But instead holding an exercise of self-determination monitored under the UN, the Indian Election Commission and the Military government in control over Goa held the first, Legislative Assembly elections in 1963. Goa is probably the only decolonized territory which was deprived of having a plebiscite. Goan's always wanted a unique identity from India. They uniquely participated in the decolonization from Portugal, following decolonization did not want the merger of then union territory of Goa with Maharashtra through opinion poll subsequently asked for statehood of Goa, and continue to work towards the recognition of Roman script for Konkani. Early 20th century The abolition of the Portuguese monarchy in 1910 raised hopes that the colonies would be granted self-determination; however, when Portuguese colonial policies remained unchanged, an organised and dedicated freedom movement emerged. Lu√≠s de Menezes Bragan√ßa founded O Heraldo, the first Portuguese language newspaper in Goa, which was critical of Portuguese colonial rule. In 1917, the \\"Carta Organica\\" law was passed, overseeing all civil liberties in Goa. In reaction to growing dissent, the Portuguese government in Goa implemented policies which curtailed civil liberties, including censorship of the press. Strict censorship policies required any material containing printed words, including invitation cards, to be submitted to a censorship committee for screening. The Portuguese governor of Goa was empowered to suspend publication, close down printing presses and impose heavy fines on newspapers which refused to comply with these policies. Many Goans criticised the curtailing of press freedoms, stating that the only newspapers and periodicals the Portuguese permitted them to publish were pro- colonialist propaganda materials.Janaka Perera, Goa's Liberation and Sri Lanka's Crisis, Asian Tribune, 18 December 2006 Goa's Opinion Poll The Goa Opinion Poll was a referendum held in the state of Goa, India, on 16 January 1967, to decide the future of the Union Territory of Goa, Daman and Diu within the Indian Union. Although popularly called an opinion poll, it was in fact, a referendum, as the results of the poll were binding on the government of India. The referendum offered the people of Goa a choice between continuing as a union territory or merging with the state of Maharashtra. It is the only referendum to have been held in independent India. The people of Goa voted against the merger and Goa continued to be a union territory. Subsequently, in 1987, Goa became a full-fledged state within the Indian Union. Goa Statehood Dr. Jack de Sequeira was the founder president of the United Goans Party.The emergence of UGP and MGP He played a pivotal role in convincing the government of India to hold an opinion poll to decide the issue of the merger of Goa into the state of Maharashtra Movement for official recognition of Romi Konkani Recently, there has been a renewed surge in the support for Romi Konkani and in the demand for official recognition for the Roman script alongside the Devanagari script. Some examples of this are the growing online readership for Vauraddeancho Ixtt and several groups and pages on social networking website Facebook,https://www.facebook.com/groups/171680336294399/ in support of Romi Konkani. The critics of sole recognition of Devanagri script contend that Antruz dialect is unintelligible to most Goans, let alone other Konkanis, and that Devanagari is used very little as compared to Roman script in Goa or Kannada script in coastal KarnatakaGoanet Reader: Puzzle wrapped in an enigma, understanding Konkani in Goa Prominent among the critics are Konkani Catholics in Goa, who have been at the forefront of the Konkani agitation in 1986‚Äì87 and have for long used the Roman script including producing literature in Roman script. They are demanding that Roman script be given equal status to Devanagari.Goa group wants Konkani in Roman script Tiatr artists and tiatr aficionados are another group which supports Romi konkani. It is argued that giving official recognition to Romi Konkani will help strengthen the language by creating an inclusive environment for users of the Roman script and also to the Christian community of Goa. It will avoid people who have difficulty in using the Devanagari script or don't know the Devanagari script from feeling alienated and giving up on the language. Romi konkani is almost the only flavour of the Konkani language present on the internet. It is also the most convenient script for use with computers. There have been three state-level Literary and Cultural conventions of Konkani in the Roman Script (Romi Lipi Konkani Sahitya ani Sonvskrutik Sommelan) held in 2008, February 2010 and February 2011 in Goa. However, the criticism against official recognition of Konkani in the Roman Script is that having more than one official script for Konkani will lead to fragmentation of Konkani.  Historical Facts Related to demands  * As part of Hindu culture, the spiritual practices differ from region to region in the country, the Konkan region similarly followed various spiritual practices ranging from idols and universal Dharmic spirituality. * Many of the community owned lands have been encroached by petty thieves who are politically motivated for vote bank politics. * Most of the electoral roll members are migrants from neighbouring states and migrant labourers who have been provided voting rights unconstitutionally. * Goans used Indian languages like Sanskrit and Konkani throughout known history just like rest of India and do not discriminate based on spiritual practices, language or skin colour. * The simple Goans preferred the Portuguese as cultural partners due to their simplicity and organised methods of governance and helping to improve the Hindu Culture and environment to the best of their ability with good values. However as a political democratic model was trending globally, very few Goans who fell prey to political and business interests from outside the state for personal profits and other benefits Goa liberation movement. * The Portuguese have preserved ancient best-practice systems that existed as part of the Hindu Culture pre-colonial rule many of these have been documented in the Portuguese language. * The Portuguese were the first to record Konkani formally in Romi script prior to which it was not formally scripted and was conveyed mostly by speech. However Konkani is taught in present day schools in Deva-Nagari script. Goans today have exposure to both Romi Script and Deva-Nagari script in written form. * The Goans display disappointment with any anti-cultural government who do not give preference to genuine konkani speaking locals in government positions and majority of these positions are occupied by employees whose mother tongue or first language is not Konkani. Many proactive Goans thus have chosen to migrate by selling their properties (which is causing a cultural and intellectual drain), locally venture into arts and business or work in private firms which goes against the cultural preservation ideals of India. * Many of the politicians elected to the government simultaneously run or influence major corporations and thus taking advantage of the peaceful Hindu-Goan culture, have legalised \\"black money\\" laundering through casinos and other anti-cultural activities like real-estate by non-local firms and deforestation with no regard for the environment despite signing international climate agreements with commitments to protect the environment. This goes completely against ancient Hindu Dharmic values and the culture appreciated and safeguarded by good-willed colonists.  Benefits of Special Status  * It is claimed that by outlawing land sale to non-Goans, the inward migration will reduce. * Create conditions where Goa's unique culture and identity will thrive and grow. * Lower prices and better quality of life for Goans as the demand for homes, schools, roads, hospitals from Non Goans will be less. * Reduction in cross border Crime and Lawlessness. * Romi Konkani will thrive. * Goa and Goan can live together without outside interference  Progress of the Special Status demand  * The Goa Legislative Assembly passed a resolution requesting the Government of India to accede to Goa's request for Special Status. * The Chief Minister of Goa apprised the Prime Minister of India of the growing demand among Goans that Goa be granted Special Status under the Constitution of India. * There have been various organization fighting for the Special Status of Goa. # The Late Mathany Saldanha started the Goa Movement for Special Status as a citizens movement to further the demand for Special Status. # The Movement for special status for Goa, is another organization fighting for the Special Status.  Hindrances of the Special Status demand  * Lack of Political will from the Government of India due to small representation of Goa in the Indian Parliament(2 Members of Parliament) * Large scale business interests for the exploitation of Goa's land resources. * General disarray of People Movements. * Strong opposition from Native Goan land owners who oppose the restriction on their private property rights.  Arguments and Myths against Special Status  * Indian Government found the special status demand unjustifiable. As many of the politicians and corporates have purchased and invested in land in Goa and alongside the bollywood industry prefer to perceive and market the idea of Goa as a \\"sin city\\" (for low grade tourism and capitalise on the created circumstances monetarily) due to the privacy and tolerance in the streets of Goa. Most of these community owned lands are illegally purchased through manipulated and forged documents and PoA's (Power of Attorney) and by unchanging law of the land stand as illegal or stolen possessions. * The politicians and businessmen alongside fanatics promote the ongoing theory that Special Status is a Religious Christian demand to isolate Goa from India. * Myth - Economists argue that this may create a disaster for Goa as it has been for Kashmir. Goan's believe that the currency value of the Indian Rupee is low due to corruption in political governance and various politically influenced corporations. If economists were to measure Goa's economy independently, they would find that Goa is a self sustaining state with well balanced natural and intellectual resources. Goan's do not claim superiority but merely ask for special status because without it, a beautiful state like Goa is susceptible to cultural adulteration and corruption through opportunistic political and corporate outfits. * Some people suspect this is a conspiracy of left leaning intellectuals to limit private property rights of native Goans. Unfortunately these suspecting \\"intellectuals\\" do not respect private nor public property rights in the region with the endorsement of the local politicians. * The belief that demand for Goan land will reduce and lower prices could be fallacious. Special status will also significantly reduce the private investment in Goa, private enterprise and hence supply of most common products and services people generally take for Granted. But however this may not be a valid deduction as the economic model followed by most of the political elements in power is fallacious as it has been proved to drain out near outrageous monetary resources into unaccounted wealth commonly known by its street term \\"black money\\" as despite efforts of de-monetisation politicians have been distributing sums of money for votes even during the most recent grass-root level Panchayat elections, which could question the media published credibility and source of the monetary governance model for measuring the economy. * Special status will result in disproportionate advantage to religion based vote banks and their handlers as it happened in Kashmir. Goans and hopefully every decent human being are more cultural than religious in this age.

It was directed by Alex Segal and adapted for television by Miller. It received numerous nominations for awards, and won several of them, including three Primetime Emmy Awards, a Directors Guild of America Award and a Peabody Award. It was nominated in a total of 11 Emmy categories at the 19th Primetime Emmy Awards in 1967. Lee J. Cobb reprised his role as Willy Loman and Mildred Dunnock reprised her role as Linda Loman from the original 1949 stage production. Playbill markets this version of the play as an \\"abbreviated\\" one. Although the performance is abridged, it was adapted for television by Miller himself, meaning that not much substance was lost in the changes. The production was filmed after several weeks of rehearsals. It was a 1966 CBS television adaptation, which included Gene Wilder, James Farentino, Bernie Kopell and George Segal. Cobb was nominated for an Emmy Award for the performance. Mildred Dunnock, who had co-starred in both the original stage version and the 1951 film version, again repeated her role as Linda, Willy's devoted wife, and earned an Emmy nomination. In addition to being Emmy-nominated, Cobb and Dunnock were Grammy Award-nominated at the 9th Grammy Awards in 1967 in the category of Best Spoken Word, Documentary or Drama Recording. This movie is one of several adaptations of the play and was contemporaneous with a May 1966 BBC version starring Rod Steiger and produced by Alan Cooke. The production marked the acclaimed reunion of the leading actor and actress from the original 1949 broadway cast. The performance also marks a strong dramatic turn for George Segal who is known for his comic work, while a young Gene Wilder presents a comic but sensitive performance as Bernard.

United Press International critic Rick Du Brow noted that the first television adaptation earned a place in history: \\"it promptly took its place among the most unforgettable productions in the history of the video medium.\\" Du Brow praise Cobb's performance as great, Dunnock as a \\"bastion of strength decency and human understanding,\\" Segal as \\"superb\\" and Farentino as \\"outstanding\\". Associated Press correspondent Cynthia Lowry described the show as a powerful depiction of \\"tense, sometimes painful drama\\" told mostly by flashbacks from happier times. Lowry described Cobb's distraught performance as \\"overwhelming\\", Dunnock's portrayal of the \\"loving, patient and blindly loyal wife\\" equally powerful and the performances of both sons as sensitive. Segal won Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing ‚Äì Television Film and the Emmy Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Drama at the 19th Primetime Emmy Awards in 1967. Producers Susskind and Melnick also won the Emmy for Outstanding Dramatic Program. Meanwhile, Miller won the Emmy for Special Classifications of Individual Achievements as the adaptor. Cobb and Dunnock were Emmy-nominated for Outstanding Single Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Drama and Outstanding Single Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Drama, respectively. The production earned two Emmy nominations in Individual Achievements in Art Direction and Allied Crafts classifications and four in Individual Achievements in Electronic Production classifications. Du Brow noted that the camera work made the transitions between Willy's temporal wanderings smooth and that the color use was also essential to the mood of the scenes.

Life  On 15 January 1525, he married Margareta Eriksdotter Vasa, the widow of Joakim Brahe (d. 1520 during the Stockholm Bloodbath), and sister of the King Gustav I of Sweden. In 1525, he was appointed governor of Vyborg and in the same year, he renounced his rights on Hoya, in favor of his brothers, in exchange for guilders. In 1533, he was involved in a conspiracy against the King. The conspiracy failed, and John VII had to flee to Tallinn. He later returned to Germany and became the chief military commander of L√ºbeck. During the Count's Feud, he fought in Denmark against Christopher of Oldenburg. He attempted to occupy the island of Funen, however, his army was trounced at Mount Ochsenberg, near Assens, by a Danish army led by Johann Rantzau.

It is populated by the Babirwa (Ba-Birwa) people who came from Transvaal in present-day South Africa. Sebirwa or Birwa, the language spoken by the Babirwa people, is a dialect of Northern Sotho, along with Bididi, Lobedu, Kgaga, Hananwa, Pedi, Phalaborwa, Pulana, Tshwapong, Kutswe, Phahladira, Pai, Kopa, Kubu, etc. Northern Sotho is one of three Sesotho subgroups of Basotho. The two others are Western Sotho (better known as Setswana, which is largely spoken in Botswana), North West Province, a small number of people in Matebeland Province of Zimbabwe and Southern Sotho (spoken in Lesotho, Free State, and Vaal). The Basotho came from Ntswanatsatsi.  History  Before Moshoeshoe and his Basotho nation of Lesotho, Basotho people were there. Moshoshoe didn't found the Basotho nation but he put together a nation made up of Sotho speaking people from different Sotho speaking clans within present day Free State and Lesotho in which the British imperialist in Southern Africa erroneously called Lesotho, the Basotho nation, cutting Basotho of Moshoeshoe off from the rest of other Basothos in Orange Free State and Transvaal in present day South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Zambia, outside Lesotho as if Moshoeshoe and his people were the only Basothos in Southern Africa. Basotho people were there before Moshoeshoe was born in Menkhoaneng (c. 1786 ‚Äì 11 March 1870) to Mokhachane of Bamokoteli clan, a sub clan of Bakwena. What Moshoeshoe did was to reunite the remaining smaller and weaker clans of Basothos in the area under his Bakwena clan leadership during Shaka's wars of difaqane after the rest of the Basothos have left the area. Moshoeshoe and his Bakwena clan and the rest of the other Basotho clans originates from Ntswanatsatsi in present day South Africa. Families moved away from each other in Ntswanatsatsi and started clans using a totem as symbol of their clan (like crocodile (Kwena) which Moshoshoe' ancestors used) and different families moved to different directions within the precolonial South Africa under different leadership. Under different leadership some settled in the Western side, present day North West Province others spread around Ntswanatsatsi to the present day [Free State and Lesotho, others to present day Botswana others to present day Zimbabwe and Zambia, Namibia others others moved to the present day Gauteng in South Africa and they became patriarchs of the founding fathers of Bakgatla which also gave birth to [Northern Basotho which in turn gave birth to different Northern clans with their dialects like BaPedi , Batlokwa, Babirwa, etc and others ended up in intermarriage with other tribes they moved next to and mingled with like Swatis, Vendas and Tsongas and Ngunis and in some places these Northern Basotho' Sotho was diluted by the influence of these tribe they found in the area, they moved into and lived alongside. This is what happened to a subgroup of Northern Basotho who end up becoming Mapulana with their Sesotho influenced by Swati. Also some of the Northern Basotho having a common denominator of \\"apa\\" (meaning talk) with Vendas, I mean Balovedu, BaGubu and Babirwa of Bobirwa in the Southern part of Botswana near the Zimbabwean border along the Shashe river and with its dialect spoken on the other side of the border of Botswana in Zimbabwe. After the scattering of the Basothos from their cradle, different Basotho dialects from different locations within present day South Africa emerged and the Babirwa people were one of those who emerged, coming out of Nareng in Letswalo area near Phalaborwa under the leadership of Tshukudu between 1510 and 1599. Babirwa moved from Nareng under their leader, They trekked further North and settled in Blauwberg in the present day Limpopo and others in Botswana and Zimbabwe The Babirwa in South Africa reside in areas north of the Bochum area, north of Polokwane. There are more than 40 Babirwa surnames in South Africa which include Sebone, Malema, Makhura, Makwati, Makhurane, Maphala, Nare, Tau, Tlou-Serope, Choshi, Mmamadi, Legong (Lehong), Mangale, Taueatswala, Molefe, Mogano, Jibula (Tjibula) (Muhanu), Machete, Lehomo, Raphahlelo, Raseokgo (Sebola), Phooko, Ramalepe, Boikanyo, Selema, Morerwa (Murerwa) Makgatho, Maruatona, Monekwe (Monengwe), Madema Morebeng (Phosa) and many more. The word Bobirwa, therefore, means the land of (Babirwa) Ba-Birwa people. A large number of Babirwa left the northern South African shore and ended up living in what is today called the Bobirwa Sub District which is an administrative region in eastern Botswana, part of the Central District. Bobonong is the largest town and the headquarters of the sub-district. The sub-district is bounded by Zimbabwe to the northeast and South Africa to the southeast. The Limpopo River forms the boundary with South Africa. The Bobirwa Sub-district has an average annual rainfall of . Soils are mainly loams to sandy clay loams. Bobirwa is the lowest part of Botswana, varying from above sea level. It is intersected by a network of channels that drain into the Limpopo. Villages include Mathathane, Motlhabaneng, Tsetsebjwe, Kobojango, Bobonong, Molalatau, Tobane, Mabolwe, Semolale, Lepokole, Zanzibar, Moletemane, Sefophe and Lentswelemoriti. The sub-district has been heavily degraded by agricultural activities and is susceptible to drought. Large areas in and around the villages are bare earth caused by clearing grasses to keep snakes and insects away. Overgrazing by sheep, goats, donkeys, and cattle is also another cause. A study showed a substantial reduction in natural land cover between 1970 and 2010, combined with a significant increase in population. In addition to livestock, the sub-district is home to abundant wildlife. In 2000, there was a herd of around 200 elephants. In 2011, it was reported that the government had approved the establishment of service centers in Tsetsebjwe, Mathathane, and Gobojango as well as other large infrastructure development projects such as road improvements, bridges, and electrification. This followed rapid economic growth in the previous three years. The local people could now shop and bank in Bobonong, rather than having to travel to Selebi-Phikwe. The new centers were expected to further improve access to services. In 2012, there was a sharp increase in stock theft. This may have been caused by drought, which was forcing livestock to travel long distances to find grazing and water making them vulnerable to rustlers. The Babirwa in Zimbabwe are found in the South West of Gwanda District, in the villages of Gungwe, Ntalale, Tlhakadiyawa, Kafusi, Mawaza, Mafukung and surrounding villages. When Babirwa moved into the area which is today known as Gwanda, it was inhabited by Jahunda (Kalanga dialect) speaking people and a group of Ndebele who moved southward from the Northern side of precolonial Matabeleland South Province which they invaded under their leader Mzilikazi coming from Transvaal, South Africa by the way of Southern Botswana, running away from the Boers in Transvaal after running away from Shaka in Natal. Other group of Babirwa left Bobirwa and with other Transvaal migrants again and joined their relatives who left Transvaal for Bokgalaka, what Sothos called Zimbabwe back then Not all Basotho of Zimbabwe are Babirwa. The Sothos that are found under Beit Bridge district all the way to Manama and surrounding areas are not Babirwa. These are descendants of North Sotho of the then Northern Transvaal who have been displaced off their lands by the Boers because they were displaced and were forced to leave in fear of their lives and crossed either the Motloutse river to present day Botswana to Bokgalaka or crossed the Odi river (Limpopo) to Bokgalaka. These group of Basotho travelled in groups usually related. They came from different areas of the then Northern Transvaal as far as Potgietersrus today known as Mokopane. Others came from Polokwane around Moletse areas, Bochum, Taaibosch, Zebediela, Ga Kibi, Botlokwa, Ga Makgato etc and also there were others who were from Venda and others Tsonga speakers were and they adopted the Sotho spoken in Zimbabwe coz of association and marriage. Some of the descendants of those people did go back to South Africa as early as 1920s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 70s, 80s and reunited with their relatives in Northern Transvaal. Today they are many Pedi and Venda speaking people in Limpopo and Venda respectively with Zimbabwean roots from these migration of the returnees. Some Basothos in Zimbabwe are still in touch with the relatives of their ancestors both in South Africa and Botswana. The Sotho of Zimbabwe which is similar to the Sesotho that is spoken in Musina and surrounding area is a corrupted Kubu and it is similar to Selobedu. There is a thin line between Sebirwa, SeGubu, Setlhokwa, Selobedu and other Northern Sotho dialects that uses \\"apa\\" (talk) and uses \\"boswa\\" for \\"pap\\" (maize porridge stable food) because these languages are related language with Venda words common denominator and speakers of these share surnames like Malema, Mafela, Moedi, Mahomela, Mokoena. Your surname tells who you are but many Basotho lost their identity when they were forced by the Ndebeles to use totems as Surname, that is why today, some Sothos uses Ndlovu, Nyathi, Sibanda, Moyo, Dube, Mdlongwa, surnames instead of their surnames which patriachs still uses even though it is not in their identity document but many Northern Sotho patriarch still uses their South African surnames like Maphala, Malema, Sephuma, Mafela, Phalantwa, Molwantwa, Sephuma, Sephodi, Makgalema, Moedi, Sehata, Makushu, Mahumela, Madumetja, Makhura, Makwati, Maimela, Manamela, Pheta, Mokone, Mokwena, Marishane, References Citations Sources Populated places in Botswana Central District (Botswana) ","title":"Bobirwa"},{"id":"37041475","text":"Nathan Eachus (born June 15, 1990) is a former American football running back.
