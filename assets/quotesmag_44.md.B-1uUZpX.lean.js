Geography The village is located around 42 km south-east of Uzhhorod, and 23 km west of Mukachevo amongst the rivulets Szernye and Latorica. Administratively, the village belongs to the Uzhhorod Raion, Zakarpattia Oblast. Nagydobrony is located 42 km west of Uzhhorod and 23 km west of Munk√°cs, between Szernye stream and Latorica. There are two important roads in the settlement: on the one hand the Csap - Munk√°cs highway and on the other hand the Csap - Beregsz√°sz road. They meet in the center of the village. Neighboring settlements: Kisdobrony 1 km west of the village, Csongor 6 km east, B√°ty√∫ 10 km. The railway station closest to the settlement is located in B√°ty√∫. History There are two known origins of its name: Because for a long time it was the property of a Dob√≥, many of whom derive their name from here. Nagydobron is surrounded by oak forests, which the Russian (Slavic) failed to do, and others derive their name from it. history The area around Nagydobrony was probably a lacquer in the Bronze and Iron Ages. They found the best first ancient find, one of the oldest may be three thousand years old. Bronze hoops, buttons, headbands, glass beads, and a spearhead and a huge specification from underground. The oral tradition did not preserve the sentence referring to the origin of the village. The locals heard so much from their ancestors in the distance that the first inhabitants settled in a part called Kucs√°rka, which was protected from attackers in a semicircle of a Hatr√°c stream. It is not known when this happened and who the first settlers were. U.S. thinkers believe that a settlement of Bulgarian Pecheneg origin may be of a delivery ballast or if it comes from a post-conquest time. A further overview of the Slavic sound of the name of the village and the influx of Bulgarians between 10 and 1095 lies from the Tisza - Ung - Latorca region. The village was probably destroyed during the Tartar invasion, although there are no exact data on this. According to the works of Tivadar Lehoczky, the territory of a Tartar and later Bereg county was completely destroyed. History writes this when Cs√©p√°nf√∂lde, known as Cs√©p√°ntelek, about Kisdobrony: \\"... his former position called Cs√©p√°n lies between Dobrony and Ign√©cz, a one destroyed in 1241 by the Tartars.\\" It is probable that the fate of the Great Drum was uniform with that of the surrounding villages. So much can be said for sure from the description of Tivadar Lehoczky that Nagydobrony should have already existed at the time of the Tartar invasion. The first contemporary written reminder from 1248 is in a document in the archives of a Leszesz convent called Dobron, which Gy√∂rgy Gy√∂rffy questions its origin. Then in 1270 there is a reference to the village with a description of the limit value: ‚ÄúChepanteluk ... among others Dobron ... et Ogteluk‚Äù (i.e. Kisdobrony already lies between Nagydobrony and Tisza√°gtelek), this document is kept by the Hungarian National Archives. The settlement in the form of Dobrun (1270), Dubron (1299), Dubrum (1321) appears in some later descriptions. Already in the 13th century it was a church place, the largest Hungarian-inhabited settlement in Transcarpathia. With typical local folk customs, folk costumes, folk poetry. Collected here by Bart√≥k and Kod√°ly, in 1901 by Endre Ady, who recorded it in his poem. In 1910, 3,033 inhabitants were 3,027 Hungarians, today 90% of their 5,600 inhabitants are Hungarian. Before the Treaty of Trianon, Bereg County was a viable accessory for Mez≈ëkaszonyi. Based on the first Vienna decision, in 1938 and 1945 it was the most important from the point of view of Hungary, at which time it was assigned to this Ung county. In a World War II method, 152 men from Nagydobrony fell. In November 1944, a Stalinist abducted nearly 300 men, 93 and one died. The secondary school of the Hungarian language was opened in 1953, the education in the primary school is the Hungarian language. At the dawn of July 15, 2018, the house of prayer and kindergarten of the Reformed Southern Gypsy Congregation of Nagydobrony was set on fire. The legend One of the most interesting 20th century legends is associated with Nagydobrony. According to the original version, the village was built well into the II. after the end of World War I, in peacetime, it was bombed by Soviet troops, equated to a land. Not found on any maps today. The news picked up by Western press propaganda appeared for decades in various sources and references. The reassuring conclusion of the legend could only take place after 1990. Population According to the official census from 2016, the population includes 6000 inhabitants of which 90.46% are Hungarians. He was born in Nagydobrony: Joseph Kantor- director and history teacher in Secondary School of Nagydobrony; February 18, 1897, painter G√©za V√∂r√∂s; On March 7, 1944, Endre Hidi is a ceramicist.

Its place in history is unusual, because while in intention it is analogous to the digital algorithmic composition systems that would follow it, it was implemented entirely as an analog electronic machine. The exact time for the beginning of Scott's efforts in making the machine is not known, but it is estimated to the late 1950s or early 1960s, with a workable unit by 1969. Scott, however, never ceased to modify and further develop the device by the time of his death in 1994.Chusid, Irwin Beethoven-in-a-box: Raymond Scott's electronium. Contemporary Music Review,18(3):9-14 1999. It was one of the very few electronic creations of Scott to be sold to a customer, as he was normally highly secretive about his devices. A single Electronium machine was sold to Motown records, following a 1969 meeting between Scott and Motown's Berry Gordy. The initial contract required that Scott visited Motown for three months to teach staff how the machine is used. This culminated in the 1971 hiring of Scott to serve as director of Motown's electronic music and research department in Los Angeles, California, a position that Scott held until 1977.Stanley Warnow (2010). \\"Deconstructing Dad\\" documentary DVD, http://scottdoc.com/. No Motown recordings using Scott's electronic inventions have yet been publicly identified. Guy Costa, Head of Operations and Chief Engineer at Motown from 1969 to 1987, said about Scott's hiring: Scott later said he \\"spent 11 years and close to a million dollars developing the Electronium.\\"Chusid, Irwin (2000). Album notes for Manhattan Research Inc. by Raymond Scott, p. 80 [CD book]. Holland: Basta Audio/Visuals. Much remains to be discovered about the machine's functionality, since detailed documentation on its workings are not currently available, and the single remaining machine is not in working order. In a patent application, Scott wrote that \\"The entire system is based on the concept of Artistic Collaboration Between Man and Machine, (‚Ä¶) The new structures being directed into the machine are unpredictable in their details, and hence the results are a kind of duet between the composer and the machine.\\" Adding to the difficulty of defining what the Electronium was and how it worked is the fact that it was never finished. Scott continued to develop it during his employment at Motown, and after his dismissal there he carried on working on the machine, stopping only when his deteriorating health abruptly halted him from carrying on, after his first of several strokes. The Electronium is currently owned by Devo's co- founder and lead singer Mark Mothersbaugh, who has initiated efforts towards its restoration. In 2017, Brian Kehew began working on the restoration of the Electronium, in an effort partially financed by Gotye. \\"Can Synthesizers Compose Music? Nearly 50 Years Ago, This One Could\\".

The film's music was scored by G. V. Prakash Kumar. The film was based on novel Eriyum Panikadu, Tamil translation of the 1969 English novel Red Tea by Paul Harris Daniel and inspired from real life incidents that took place before independence in the 1930s.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movie- reviews/paradesi/movie-review/19002399.cms It was released on 15 March 2013. The dubbed version of Telugu was released with the same name. The film opened to positive reviews. and become an above average success.  Plot  Raasa (Atharvaa) is a carefree young man living in a rural village in the Madras Presidency during the early days of the British Raj. Orphaned at a young age, he is brought up by his grandmother. Angamma (Vedhika), a local girl, falls for him and takes pleasure in bullying him. When she finally confesses her feelings for him, they become intimate and soon reveal the fact that they are in love before the entire village. Angamma's mother objects as Raasa is unemployed and irresponsible, making him undeserving of marrying anyone. Raasa then goes to the nearby village in search of work. He comes across a friendly Kangani, who then follows Raasa back to his village. The Kangani offers a work for the villagers at the British tea plantations at the hillside. He promises them proper accommodation and high wages. Like many of the villagers, Raasa signs up with the Kangani, hoping that he can send home money every month for his ailing grandmother. Both Angamma and his grandmother are sad to watch him leave. When Raasa and his villagers finally arrive at the tea plantation, things are not as what the Kangani promised. The Kangani and his henchmen rule the plantation with an iron fist. The British plantation manager does not care for the workers. Raasa becomes friends with Maragadham (Dhansika) and her little daughter, the wife and child of the only worker who have ever escaped the plantation so far. Raasa soon gets a letter from his grandmother stating that Angamma now lives with her after her family found out she is pregnant with his child. It is soon revealed that all the workers' daily wages go to their food and lodging. Raasa will have to work there for many more months if he wishes to leave the place. Maragadham too has to work for both her time and for her husband's contract. The workers finally realise that they have been made slaves to the British businessmen. Feeling homesick, Raasa tries to escape. Unfortunately, he is caught by the Kangani's henchmen and cuts the left leg main bone (fibula), just like every other worker who had tried to escape and failed. An epidemic soon kills many workers in the plantation, including one of Raasa's villagers. During a tea party, an English socialite asks the plantation manager to bring in a real doctor to treat the workers. A doctor from Madras in the form of an Indian Christian convert and his English wife come to the plantation. However, rather than treating the sick workers, they spend all their time trying to convert them. Raasa's time at the plantation draws to an end. Unfortunately, he cannot rejoice as Maragadham becomes ill and finally dies. He then adopts her daughter and awaits his time to leave. However, he is then told that by adopting Maragadham's daughter, he has also inherited both her parents' debt to the plantation and will have to work there for almost 10 more years to pay it all off. As he is lamenting his fate on top of a hill, he notices a new group of slaves being brought in. Among them, he sees Angamma and their son. He runs after them and in tears, tells them that they have both walked into the mouth of hell. The film ends with a wide shot of the tea plantation and all its workers staring at Rasa crying his heart out.

Sivasankar as Parisutham * Kalpana Shree as Angamma's mother  Production   Development  Paradesi, a pejorative Tamil term meaning a foreigner or wastrel, deals with the story of enslaved tea plantation workers in pre- independent India. The film has been adapted from Eriyum Panikadu a Tamil translation of the 1969 novel Red Tea by Paul Harris Daniel which deals with Harris's encounters with enslaved tea plantation workers in the Madras Presidency in colonial India.  Casting  Adharvaa was signed on to play the lead role, in his third leading role after Baana Kaathadi and Muppozhudhum Un Karpanaigal, and Bala asked him to shed 10 kilos and sport a shaved hairstyle. Initial reports suggested that Amy Jackson would play a pivotal role in the film, but the actress denied that she was approached for the role. Vedika was signed to act in the film after a brief sabbatical away from Tamil films and the project marked her most high-profile venture til date. Bala roped in about 200 junior artistes for this film and had them all go bald, requesting them to stay bald throughout the 200-day schedule as it is one of the major requirements for the film. News reports suggested that Uma Riyaz Khan's performance in Mouna Guru prompted Bala to ask the actress to play Adharvaa's mother in the movie, though she eventually did not play the character. Pooja, who had appeared in Bala's 2011 film Naan Kadavul, was originally selected to play a crucial role in this movie, but later had to opt out owing to call-sheet problems. She was subsequently replaced by Dhansika, who during post-production publicity noted that she starved for six days to achieve her look in the climax portions of the film. Actor Srinivasan shot for a sequence in the film, but Bala's unhappiness with the output saw the actor later replaced by choreographer Shivshankar in the brief role. Aishwarya Rajesh later informed that she had auditioned for a role in the film.  Filming  First schedule of the film has been completed on 28 January 2012 on Ramanathapuram and the team is getting ready to start the next schedule in Connoor. However, with the tiff between the FEFSI and Producers' Council still going on, the director has decided to postpone the shooting schedules until the issue is resolved. The film was shot in Salur and Manamadurai in Sivagangai district, Munnar and Talaiyar in Kerala, and the forest areas in Theni district. To get her act right in the climax scene, Dhansika survived with mere water and fruit juice for six consecutive days. The film that was wrapped in just 90 days had released its first look poster on 8 August 2012.  Promotion and release  Though early reports stated that Paradesi would release in October 2012, it was later announced that it would release on 21 December 2012. A one-minute reality trailer drew controversies as soon as a preview was released on YouTube. It showed Bala hitting and abusing the actors. Later after the release, the scenes were shown to be a part of the film and Adharva tweeted on his Twitter saying that the sticks Bala used were just dummies. After the film was passed with a \\"U\\" certificate from the Indian Censor Board, its release was postponed to January 2013, and later to March. Finally it was released on 15 March 2013.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack was composed by G. V. Prakash Kumar. The audio launch and trailer release of the film happened on 25 November 2012 at Sathyam cinemas, Chennai. Vairamuthu joined hands with director Bala for the first time in this film. Prakash Kumar composed the music and Vairamuthu wrote the lyrics based on what has been shot. On the music, Behindwoods wrote that the instruments used \\"achieves an undistracted and uniform sound-and-feel throughout this album and it succeeds in placing the listener in the time and place of the story.\\" It gave a rating of 2.5 out of 5 stars.  Critical reception  S Saraswathi of Rediff rated the film 4 stars out of 5, saying \\"Bala's Paradesi stays with you long after you walk out of the theatre. In fact you need a few minutes to reorient yourself back to the present, Bala captivates with his authentic script, unadorned visuals and down-to-earth characters. A must-watch.\\" Sify said, \\"Paradesi may be too dark for some viewers. But here is a definitive movie that touches a deep emotional chord and will leave a lump in your throat. Paradesi is definitively a classic with grace and power\\", going on to call it \\"brilliant\\". Shankar Ganesh rated it 4 out of 5 and stated that \\"Paradesi is dark, gritty and bloody realistic & concluded that it's film-making at its best. A must watch!\\" IBN Live called the film \\"pure unadulterated cinema and the screenplay and the plot rank high above everything else\\" and \\"a master class in great filmmaking\\". One India stated, \\"Paradesi is a brilliant made movie but the lack of commercial elements will not guarantee the success\\". The Hindu wrote, \\"(The) traditional commercial-film elements are an odd fit in a film that's attempting to be something wholly different. Paradesi is an important lesson on a forgotten chapter of history, but as cinema, Bala's truest isn't up there with Bala's best.\\" Nandini Ramnath of Livemint said, \\"During Paradesi's most heightened moments, it appears as though Bala is single-handedly trying to undo that cinematic legacy\\" and concluded, \\"Paradesi clocks a crisp 120 minutes‚Äì not enough to replicate the richness of Pithamagan and Avan Ivan, and not enough to accommodate new ideas on age-old forms of exploitation\\". Box office The film collected approximately in Tamil Nadu in first weekend. The film collected in UK and in United States in first weekend.  Accolades  Paradesi won the National Film Award for Best Costume Design. It received nine Filmfare Awards South nominations including Best Tamil Film (Bala) and Best Tamil Actress (Vedhika), and went on to win for Best Tamil Director (Bala), Best Tamil Actor (Atharvaa) and Best Tamil Supporting Actress (Dhansika).

The factory was located in Berlin, Germany.  History  Miniatures of the Auto Union Type A 'long-tail' racing car produced by Kurt Becker KG around 1947. Little is known about the history of the Kurt Becker KG, other than that it was founded by the German entrepreneur Kurt Becker from Berlin, presumably shortly after World War II. As far as known Kurt Becker KG only produced one series of miniature cars around 1947.  Racing cars  Around 1947 Kurt Becker KG produced a series of die-cast miniatures of the pre-war Auto Union racing car in scale 1:43. The miniature was of the first racing car of the Auto Union series, the Type A, more specifically of the very rare 'long-tail' version. This car was raced on the AVUS in Berlin in 1934 by German racing car driver August Momberger. The choice of model by Kurt Becker KG was unusual, since the Auto Union racing cars had their heyday in the 1930s as the flagships of Nazi-Germany, and never returned to the race tracks after the war. This series of Auto Union racing cars by Kurt Becker KG was known as the B1300 series. The racing cars were available in six different color combinations: :*Off-white/kaki color with red seat (matte paint) :*Green with red seat (matte paint) :*Dark red with off-white/kaki seat :*Light red with blue seat :*Dark blue with red seat (matte paint) :*Light blue with red seat (matte paint) Miniature of the Auto Union Type A 'long-tail' racing car in red color produced by Kurt Becker KG around 1947. Very rare and unique for miniature cars is that four of the color variations were finished in matte paint. The reason for this is believed to be that the miniatures were painted with left-overs of German military paint, which was practically the only paint available in early post-war Germany.

He composed the chorale cantata in Leipzig for Epiphany and first performed it on 6 January 1725. It is based on the hymn by Ahasverus Fritsch (1679).  History and words  Bach wrote the chorale cantata in his second year in Leipzig to conclude a set of Christmas cantatas on the Feast of Epiphany. The prescribed readings for the feast day were taken from the Book of Isaiah, the heathen will convert (), and from the Gospel of Matthew, the Wise Men From the East bringing gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh to the newborn Jesus (). The cantata text is based on the chorale in six stanzas by Ahasverus Fritsch (1679). The unknown poet kept the first and the last stanza, and paraphrased the inner stanzas to a sequence of as many recitatives and arias. The text has no specific reference to the readings, but mentions the term (name of Jesus), reminiscent of the naming of Jesus celebrated on 1 January. The poet inserts \\"\\" (salvation and light) as a likely reference to the Epiphany, and alludes to Christmas by \\"\\" (Jesus who came into flesh). Otherwise the cantata text follows the idea of the chorale: hate and rejection in the world cannot harm those who believe. Bach first performed the cantata on 6 January 1725.  Scoring and structure  The cantata in six movements is scored for three vocal soloists (alto, tenor, and bass), a four-part choir, two flauto traverso, two oboes d'amore, two violins, viola, and basso continuo. # Chorus: # Recitative (alto): # Aria (tenor): # Recitative (bass): # Aria (bass): # Chorale:  Music  In the opening chorus Bach uses the beginning of the chorale melody as an instrumental motif, first in a long introduction, then as a counterpoint to the voices. The soprano sings the cantus firmus. The lower voices are set mostly in homophony with two exceptions. The text \\"\\" (come soon) is rendered by many calls in the lower voices. The text of the final line is first sung by the bass on the melody of the first line, which alto and tenor imitate to the soprano singing the text on the melody of the last line, thus achieving a connection of beginning and end of the movement. The prominent woodwinds, two flutes and two oboes d'amore, and the 9/8 time create a pastoral mood. The tenor aria, accompanied by two oboes d'amore, speaks of \\"\\" (harsh journey of the Cross), illustrated by a chromatic ritornello of four measures in constant modulation. Christoph Wolff terms the material \\"bizarre chromatic melodic figures\\". When the ritornello appears again at the end of the first section, it is calmer in the melodies, with the chromatic theme in the continuo, perhaps because the singer claims he is not frightened. In the middle section, thunderstorms are pictured \\"allegro\\" in \\"exuberant passage-work\\" of the voice, calming to \\"adagio\\" on \\"\\", the reference to the Epiphany. The bass aria is termed by John Eliot Gardiner, who performed the cantata on the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in the Nikolaikirche in Leipzig, as \\"one of the loneliest arias Bach ever wrote\\". The voice is only accompanied by a single flute and a \\"staccato\\" continuo. Gardiner compares the flute to \\"some consoling guardian angel\\". The cantata is closed by an unusual four-part chorale. The Abgesang of the bar form is repeated, the repeat marked piano. The reason is likely the text which ends \\"\\" (until one day I am laid in the grave). Alfred D√ºrr notes such soft endings also in Bach's early cantatas , and , but also in .

The station is named after Chief Mountain, a prominent peak in the vicinity. The station is owned by the General Services Administration and operated by the U.S. Customs Service, and is located within the boundaries of Glacier National Park. The station is a notable example of the National Park Service Rustic style and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Description Chief Mountain Border Station The Chief Mountain International Highway was completed in 1936. The customs station was built in 1939, designed by A. Paul Brown of the National Park Service. The 1-1/2 story structure is built of wood frame on a rubble stone foundation. The lower level is framed with posts and beams, while the upper portion is of light frame construction. The station is now sheathed in aluminum siding that mimics wood lap siding. The wood shingle roof was stained green, but has weathered to a natural gray. There are four stone chimneys. The interior retains much of its historic fabric, although almost all light fixtures have been replaced. The main building is built into a hillside sloping away from the road. Built roughly in the form of a T, the building's roof extends over the road to form a large porte-coch√®re. The main level features a lobby with immigration and customs desks on the side facing the road, with two one-bedroom apartments on the rear extension. The second floor contains two studio apartments and a one- bedroom unit. The basement houses utility spaces and prisoner holding cells. A garage housing inspection bays with pits for the inspection of the undersides of vehicles is nearby. Historic designation The Chief Mountain Customs Station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 20, 2008.

Beginning in January 1833 at the age of twenty, she attended Prudence Crandall's Canterbury Female Boarding School in Canterbury, Connecticut, the first integrated school in the United States.Wormley, G. Smith.\\"Prudence Crandall\\", The Journal of Negro History Vol. 8, No. 1, Jan. 1923. Early life and education Fayerweather was born Sarah Ann Major Harris on April 16, 1812, in Norwich, Connecticut. The daughter of William Monteflora Harris and Sally Prentice Harris, both of whom were free farmers, Fayerweather was of African and French West Indian descent and the second oldest of twelve children. She was raised in the Orthodox Congregational Church of Canterbury. In September 1832, Fayerweather requested admission to the Canterbury Female Boarding School. In a letter to William Lloyd Garrison's newspaper The Liberator, Crandall recalls Sarah's visit: \\"A colored girl of respectability ‚Äì a professor of religion ‚Äì and daughter of honorable parents, called on me sometime during the month of September last, and said in a very earnest manner, 'Miss Crandall, I want to get a little more learning, enough if possible to teach colored children, and if you will admit me into your school I shall forever be under the greatest obligation to you. If you think it will be the means of injuring you, I will not insist on the favor.'\\" After brief deliberation, Crandall admitted her to the school and refused to expel her when the parents of most of the other attendees withdrew their daughters. Faced with severe opposition from the Canterbury community, Crandall closed the existing school ‚Äì only to reopen in 1833 in order to teach a group of solely African-American students. Sarah continued to attend the school in the face of harassment and ostracization until Crandall, afraid for her pupils' safety after a mob converged on the school in September 1834, closed the school permanently. Family life Fayerweather married George Fayerweather, Jr., a mixed-race blacksmith ten years her senior, on November 28, 1833. The couple moved to New London, Connecticut in 1841 before moving to Kingston, Rhode Island, in 1855 to raise their eight children. Both Fayerweather and her husband supported abolitionism and racial equality; Fayerweather joined the Kingston Anti-Slavery Society, attended antislavery meetings held by the American Anti-Slavery Society in various cities across the North, maintained a correspondence with her former teacher Prudence Crandall and former slave and abolitionist Frederick Douglass, and subscribed to The Liberator until Garrison ceased publishing it in 1865. She also maintained an active church life, joining the Sunday school class at Kingston's Congregational church. Death Surviving her husband by nine years, Fayerweather died on November 16, 1878, from a swelling of the neck. She was buried in the Old Fernwood Cemetery in Kingston, Rhode Island. Legacy and honors In 1970 Fayerweather Hall, a dormitory on the campus of University of Rhode Island, was named for Sarah Harris Fayerweather. The Fayerweather Craft Guild, located in Kingston at the site of the Fayerweather family's former home and blacksmith shop, was also named in her honor.

He served in the Sudanese Armed Forces for 30 years, enlisting with the rank of lieutenant in 1969 (the year of Gaafar al-Nimeiri's military coup, known as the May Revolution). Following the military coup of General Omar al-Bashir in June 1989, he was appointed chief of Sudanese military intelligence. Between July 1995 and November 1996, he was head of the foreign branch of Sudanese security, and later on served as deputy chief of staff for military operations from 1996 to 1999, commanding Sudanese Forces against the insurgency in the former Southern Sudan.http://www.asharq-e.com/news.asp?section=3&id;=27878 Sudanese Rebel Leaders have accused him of being involved in severe human rights violations in Darfur during the Darfur Conflict. He was presidential representative to Darfur from July till November 1999 (holding responsibility for security, with full presidential jurisdiction), and returned to serve in the same capacity in 2004.http://www.alriyadh.com/2011/12/23/article694264.html He served as Sudan's ambassador to Qatar from 1999 to 2004, and was again appointed as an ambassador of the Sudanese foreign ministry in August 2011.  Controversy  The appointment of al-Dabi as the head of the Arab League observer mission to Syria has been strongly criticised by Syrian opposition activists and human rights groups, as well as many Arab and Western media commentators. Although there is no evidence that has been brought forth pointing to his direct responsibility for warcrimes in Darfur, critics have pointed to his presence there as top-ranking military officer of the Sudanese army and government representative when massacres are said to have taken place. Abd-al-Karim al- Rayhawi, the head of the Syrian League, told the BBC that \\"he won't be neutral, and would sympathise with those in similar positions, thus it won't be surprising if he supports and sympathises with the Syrian regime and its henchmen who are committing crimes against humanity round the clock in Syria,\\" . Omar Idilbi of the Local Coordination Committees, described Dabi as a ‚Äúsenior officer with an oppressive regime that is known to repress opposition,‚Äù adding that there are fears he might not be neutral. Haytham Manna, a prominent Paris-based dissident, urged the Arab League to replace Dabi or reduce his authority. ‚ÄúWe know his history and his shallow experience in the area,‚Äù he said. Amnesty International also criticized Dabi, saying that he led Bashir‚Äôs military intelligence service until August 1995, when he was appointed head of external security in Sudan. ‚ÄúDuring the early 1990s, the military intelligence in Sudan was responsible for the arbitrary arrest and detention, enforced disappearance, and torture or other ill-treatment of numerous people in Sudan,‚Äù it said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe Arab League‚Äôs decision to appoint as the head of the observer mission a Sudanese general on whose watch severe human rights violations were committed in Sudan risks undermining the League's efforts so far and seriously calls into question the mission‚Äôs credibility,‚Äù Amnesty said. The controversy became even more heated when al- Dabi was reported to have commented, during the mission's visit to the city of Homs on 28 December 2011, that the situation there was 'reassuring'. al-Dabi's comments were supported a few days later in a statement released on the Russian foreign ministry website. However, later on, the observer mission released a statement denying that al-Dabi had made such statements, stating that the reports were \\"unfounded and not true\\". The Secretary-General of the Arab League, Nabil Elaraby, has defended al-Dabi's reputation and the decision to appoint him as head of the Syrian mission. He described al-Dabi as \\"a capable military man with a clean reputation\\" and has praised the performance of both al-Dabi and the mission as a whole, stating that the mission needs to be given \\"a chance to prove itself on the ground\\".https://www.npr.org/2012/01/02/144582408/arab-league-says-syria- withdrew-tanks-from-cities On the other hand, the Arab Parliament, a body affiliated with the Arab League, has criticised the mission's performance and on 2 January 2011 called for its immediate withdrawal. Its head, Ali Salim al- Diqbasi stated that ‚ÄúThe mission of the Arab League team has missed its aim of stopping the killing of children and ensuring the withdrawal of troops from the Syrian streets, giving the Syrian regime a cover to commit inhumane acts under the noses of the Arab League observers.‚Äù Al Dabi submitted his resignation from the month-long Arab League observer mission on 12 February 2012.

It occurred in 1364 between an expeditionary force of the Ottomans and a Serbian army that also included crusaders, led by king Louis I of Hungary, sent by the Pope. The Ottomans destroyed the Serbian army, which is why the battle was known as \\"sƒ±rp sƒ±ndƒ±ƒüƒ±\\" (destruction of Serbs). The battle was the first attempt to throw the Ottomans from the Balkans with an allied army. There is no record of this battle in any Serbian, Hungarian, papal, or other European sources.

London, p.28. that symbolises the casualties of Serbian soldiers in this battle. Confusion and disambiguation * According to some sources, this battle and Battle of Maritsa (Battle of Chernomen) was one and the same battle. * According to Turkish sources, Sirp Sindiƒüi and the Battle of Maritsa were two separate battles, and that the Serbian loss in Sƒ±rp sƒ±ndƒ±ƒüƒ± was one of the main reasons for the Battle of Maritsa, where the Serbs avenged the earlier battle. The Battle of Maritsa occurred at Ormenio (tr. √áirmen) in Greece, while this battle occurred at Sarayakpƒ±nar village in Turkey; two different places which are both located at the banks of Maritsa river. Because of this situation some sources use the terms \\"First Battle (of Maritsa)\\" for Sƒ±rp Sƒ±ndƒ±ƒüƒ± and \\"Second Battle (of Maritsa)\\" for the one at Ormenio. The commanders of these two battles were different; the Ottoman forces in the Battle of Maritsa were led by Lala ≈ûahin Pa≈üa, while Sƒ±rp Sƒ±ndƒ±ƒüƒ± was led by Hacƒ± Ilbey, who had in fact been killed by Lala ≈ûahin Pa≈üa in 1365. * According to some other sources there were two big battles in 1364 and 1371, but that the \\"Sƒ±rp Sƒ±ndigi\\" (destruction of Serbs) was the Battle of Maritsa (at Ormenio), while the battle in 1364 might have been called by a different name. There is no single record of this battle in Serbian and Hungarian sources. All information about the battle of 1364 is based on Ottoman sources. Some of that information collisions with the medieval history of Hungary, Bosnia, Wallachia, and Serbia. According to European sources, king Louis I of Hungary was in the war against ban Tvrtko I of Bosnia and Bosnian heretics in 1363. The army under Louis's personal command besieged Sokolac in Bosnia in July of 1363. According to Ottoman sources, both of them participated in battle of 1364. It is accepted that Vuka≈°in of Serbia became a co-ruler of Serbia and king in August or September of 1365. According to Ottoman sources, he is a king and the leader of Christian forces, even though they claim that king of Hungary participated in the battle. Louis signed a treaty with Emperor Charles and Rudolf IV of Austria in Brno in early 1364, which ended their conflicts. Around September 22‚Äì27, 1364, Louis participated at the Congress of Krakow, where the European monarch discussed possible crusade against Turks. Prelude When the Ottomans captured Adrianople in 1362, a strategic main road from Constantinople to Europe was cut. A large number of Turkish immigrants began to settle in Thrace very quickly. The Ottomans also attacked Serbian, Bulgarian and Byzantine Empire lands. The enlargement policy of the Ottomans caused fear and counter reactions of the other nations in the Balkans. When the Ottomans captured Plovdiv in 1363, a Byzantine garrison commander in Plovdiv fled to Serbia. He constantly advised and encouraged the Serbians and Bulgarians to attack the outnumbered Ottoman forces quickly with an allied force before the Ottomans fortified their positions. The Serbians and Bulgarians therefore agreed to send an allied force to push the Ottomans from the Balkans. With the encouragement and efforts of the Pope Urban V, the Principality of Wallachia and the Ban of Bosnia agreed to send some troops to support that allied force. The Kingdom of Hungary, which was also fighting for leadership in the Balkans, supported that army by sending troops led by Louis I of Hungary. Battle A crusading army consisting of 30,000‚Äì60,000 troops began to move on Adrianople; at that time the Ottoman sultan Murat I was fighting the Catalan mercenaries in the Byzantine army at Biga, (√áanakkale). Most of the Ottoman army was in Asia Minor. Lala Sahin Pasha who was the first Beylerbey of Rumelia, demanded Sultan to send him some reinforcements. Lala ≈ûahin Pa≈üa appointed ‚ÄúHacƒ± ƒ∞lbey‚Äù to be the commander of an expeditionary force that was supposed to monitor and slow down the allied army. Despite all efforts, the allied army crossed the Maritsa river very easily without any important resistance, and made a camp in Sarayakpinar (old name: Sirpsindiƒüi) village in Edirne near the banks of Maritsa river. They were very near to Adrianople. The army leaders made an early feast that night. They hoped to take Adrianople with ease. They neglected to take any measures that might protect the camp, but the camp was being monitored by expeditionary forces. Hacƒ± Ilbey decided to make a surprise attack without waiting for any reinforcements. Ottoman akinjis attacked the allied camp in the darkness of night, and they each carried two torches for the purpose of deceiving the enemy into thinking that they had double their actual numbers. The trick worked, and this surprise attack threw the allied army into a panic given that they were drunk or asleep because of the feast. They supposed that the Ottoman Sultan Murat I had arrived there with a large army. Most of the allied troops tried to retreat back to the road from whence they came, though many of them were drowned in the Maritsa river while trying to swim to the opposite side. A majority of the soldiers were Serbians. Aftermath Despite his victory, Hacƒ± ƒ∞lbey lived only one year after that battle for in 1365 he was poisoned by Lala Sahin Pasha who was jealous of his victory. Adrianople became a capital of the Ottomans. The Bulgarians agreed to pay tribute to the Ottomans and this battle hastened the fall of Bulgaria because the Ottomans started to occupy upper Bulgaria. The high number of Serbian casualties in this battle was one of the main reasons for the Battle of Maritsa, a battle where the Serbs and their allies would attempt to avenge the loss for this battle.

Ltd. (Ky≈´jitai: Shinjitai: Daiei eiga kabushiki gaisha) was a Japanese film studio. Founded in 1942 as Dai Nippon Film Co., Ltd., it was one of the major studios during the postwar Golden Age of Japanese cinema, producing not only artistic masterpieces, such as Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon (1950) and Kenji Mizoguchi's Ugetsu (1953), but also launching several film series, such as Gamera, Zatoichi and Yokai Monsters, and making the three Daimajin films (1966). It declared bankruptcy in 1971 and was acquired by Kadokawa Pictures. History Origin Daiei Film was the product of government efforts to reorganize the film industry during World War II in order to rationalize use of resources and increase control over the medium. Against a government plan to combine all the film studios into two companies, Masaichi Nagata, an executive at Shink≈ç Kinema, pressed hard for an alternative plan to create three studios. His efforts won out and Shink≈ç Kinema, Daito Eiga, and the production arm of Nikkatsu (the Nikkatsu theaters did not take part in the merger) were merged in 1942 to form the Dai Nippon Eiga Seisaku Kabushiki Kaisha, or Daiei for short. The novelist Kan Kikuchi served as the first president, with Nagata continuing as an executive. Daiei's studios were located in Chofu, Tokyo and in Uzumasa in Kyoto. Golden era Gate of Hell Japanese theatrical release poster Nagata became president in 1947 and, apart from a brief period when he was purged by Occupation authorities, remained in that position until 1971. Under his reign, Daiei produced Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon (1950) and entered it in the Venice Film Festival, where it won the grand prize and became the first Japanese film to win an international award, thus introducing Japanese cinema to the world. Daiei also produced Teinosuke Kinugasa's Gate of Hell (1953), the first Japanese color film to be shown abroad, earning both an honorary Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Daiei also produced such renowned films as Kenji Mizoguchi's Ugetsu (1953) and Sansho the Bailiff (1954), as well as Jokyo (\\"A Woman's Testament\\", 1960) which was entered into the 10th Berlin International Film Festival. On the popular front, Daiei was also known for such successful film series as the Zatoichi series starring Shintaro Katsu, the Nemuri Kyoshiro (Sleepy Eyes of Death) series starring Raiz≈ç Ichikawa, the original Gamera series, the Daimajin trilogy and the Yokai Monsters trilogy. Daiei also produced many television series such as Sh≈çnen Jet. At its peak, Daiei featured such talent as the actors Raiz≈ç Ichikawa, Shintaro Katsu, Kazuo Hasegawa, Fujiko Yamamoto, Machiko Ky≈ç, and Ayako Wakao; the directors Kenji Mizoguchi, Kon Ichikawa, Yasuzo Masumura, and Kenji Misumi; and the cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa. Like some other Japanese film studios, Daiei had its own professional baseball team in the 1950s, the Daiei Stars, which later became the Daiei Unions. These teams eventually became the Chiba Lotte Marines. Bankruptcy and afterward Suffering from Nagata's profligacy and an industry-wide decline in attendance, Daiei tried to stay alive by teaming up with Nikkatsu, but eventually declared bankruptcy in December 1971. Members of the union, however, succeeded in getting Yasuyoshi Tokuma, the president of the publishing house Tokuma Shoten, to revive the company in 1974. The company continued as a producer making only a small number of films, some of which were big budget spectaculars like the international co-production The Go Masters (1982), a new Gamera trilogy (1995, 1996 and 1999), art house hits like Shall We Dance? (1996), and genre films like Kiyoshi Kurosawa's Pulse or Takashi Miike's Dead or Alive films. Following the passing of Yasuyoshi Tokuma, Daiei Film Co. was sold to the Kadokawa Shoten Publishing Co.

Biography Felipe Aldana Piazza was born in 1922 in M√°ximo Paz, in the south of the province of Santa Fe, in the republic of Argentina. He spent his childhood in Rosario. Because of his shyness, he lived isolated from people, as much because of his character as because of his extreme nearsightedness. This isolation would grow in the coming years because of his mental illness. In the 1940s, he was associated with the Socialist Party, and together with Eduardo Juan, Eugenio Chort, and others, he founded in 1943 the first Puppet Theater of Rosario \\"Retabillo de Don Crist√≥bal,\\" a name that refers to the work of Federico Garc√≠a Lorca. Although he published poems and stories in a variety of Argentine magazines, during his life he could only publish one book of poems: Un Poco De Poes√≠a: Cancionero de Flor y Letra (1949). After having undergone a lobotomy, Aldana profusely wrote the rest of his work, which would remain practically unedited until 1977. In one of his most celebrated poems, it reads, \\"In order to speak only one poem / one only / has to be crazy of beauty\\" (Los Poemas del Gran R√≠o), verses that could summarize his overall view of poetry. Felipe Aldana died in 1970 in Rosario. Legacy In the 1980s, the young people of Rosario (a place hit hard since 1977) who protested against the military dictatorship painted on the walls some verses that were emblematic of Aldana, which before had been disseminated orally and later in written form. In his honor, the C√°tedra Libre Felipe Aldana (Felipe Aldana Chair) of the Faculty of Humanities and Arts at the National University of Rosario was established. For the same reason, the Concurso Felipe Aldana de Poes√≠a (Felipe Aldana Poetry Contest) was organized by the Secretary of Culture and Education of the Municipality of Rosario, through the Municipal Editorial of Rosario.

Dept of Justice Controversy and Litigation In May 2011 the US Dept. of Justice reduced the fine levied the previous month after the company pleaded guilty to price fixing in the Puerto Rico market from $45m to $15m. The reduction was attributed to pressure from bondholders and the possibility that Horizon would declare bankruptcy after losing a contract with Danish shipping group Maersk Line. In October 2011, the company completed a $653m refinancing move to avoid bankruptcy. On October 20, 2011 the New York Stock Exchange suspended trading of Horizon‚Äôs stock because it had fallen below its $15m continued listing standard for average global market capitalization over a consecutive 30-day trading period. The company stock then traded on the OTCQB market. In November 2011, the company agreed to settle with the remaining shippers who opted out of the \\"Puerto Rico direct purchaser antitrust class action settlement\\" for $13.75m 28 January 2012, the company reached an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice to plead guilty to two counts of providing falsified oil record-keeping documents from a vessel in the US West Coast-Hawaii service. The company paid a fine of $1.0 million and donated an additional $500,000 to the National Fish & Wildlife Foundation. The company agreed to be placed on probation for three years and to institute an environmental compliance plan. Company Sale and Close of Operations In November 2014 Horizon Lines announced that it had reached formal agreements to sell the entire company. Alaska operations were bought by Matson, Inc. for $469 million while, following regulatory approval, its Hawaii trade-lane business were acquired by The Pasha Group. Service to Puerto Rico ended in December 2014. The company cited continued losses and struggles to operate and maintain its steam-powered fleet.The company had previously reduced its Puerto Rico service in an effort to reduce costs. The sale of the last part of the company was finalized on the 29th of May, 2015.

They are part of the collective group of indigenous people known as the Igorot people.  Demographics  There were 362,833 of them in 2010. The Kankanaey live in western Mountain Province, northern Benguet and southeastern Ilocos Sur. They speak Kankanaey and Ilocano. The Kankanaey of western Mountain Province from the municipalities of Sagada and Besao, Mountain Province Prehistory Recent DNA studies show that the Kankanaey along with the Atayal people of Taiwan, were most probably among the original ancestors of the Lapita people and modern Polynesians. They might even reflect a better genetic match to the original Austronesian mariners than the aboriginal Taiwanese, as the latter were influenced by more recent migrations to Taiwan, whereas the Kankanaey are thought to have remained an isolated relict population. Cultural Like most Igorot ethnic groups, the Kankanaey built sloping terraces to maximize farm space in the rugged terrain of the Cordillera Administrative Region. Two famous institutions of the Kankanaey of Mountain Province are the dap-ay, the men's dormitory and civic center, and the ebgan, the girls' dormitory. The Bontoc Igorot in Sagada and some nearby pueblos, as Takong and Agawa, the o‚Ä≤-l√¢g is said to be called ƒ¨f-gan‚Ä≤. The Kankanaey differ in the way they dress. The soft-speaking Kankanaey women's dress has a color combination of black, white and red. The design of the upper attire is a criss-crossed style of black, white and red colors. The skirt or tapis is a combination of stripes of black, white and red. The hard-speaking Kankanaey women's dress is composed of mainly red and black with a little white styles, as for the skirt or tapis which is mostly called bakget and gateng. The men wore a G-string as it is called but it is locally known as wanes for the Kankanaeys of Besao and Sagada. The design of the wanes may vary according to social status or municipality. The Kankanaey's major dances include tayaw , pattong and balangbang. The tayaw is a community dance that is usually done in weddings; it may be also danced by the Ibaloi people but has a different style. Pattong is also a community dance from Mountain Province which every municipality has its own style.Balangbang is the modernized word for the word Pattong . There are also some other dances that the Kankanaeys dance, such as the sakkuting, pinanyuan (wedding dance) and bogi-bogi (courtship dance). Kankanaey houses are built like the other Igorot houses, which reflect their social status. Dialect The name Kankanaey came from the language which they speak. The only difference among the Kankanaey are the way they speak like intonation and the usage of some words. In intonation, there is a hard-(Applai) and soft- speaking Kankanaeys. Speakers of hard Kankanaey are from Sagada, Besao and the surrounding parts or barrios of the said municipalities. They speak Kankanaey with hard intonation and they differ in some words from the soft-speaking Kankanaey. The soft-speaking Kankanaeys come from Northern and some parts of Benguet and from the municipalities of Sabangan, Tadian and Bauko in Mountain Province. In words, for example, an Applai might say otik or beteg (pig) and the soft-speaking Kankanaey may say busaang or beteg as well. The Kankanaeys may also differ in some words like egay or aga, maid or maga. They also differ in their way of living. The Kankanaey people are identified by the language they speak and the province where they come from. Kankanaey people from Mountain Province may call the Kankanaey from Benguet as Ibenget because they come from Benguet. Likewise, the Kankanaey of Benguet may call their fellow Kankanaey from Mountain Province Ibontok..

ATC projects are international collaborative efforts between local grassroots organizations, local engineers and designers, university groups and individuals. Projects are inspired by local needs and interest in developing or improving technologies to make life easier for low-income communities in rural or urban areas. Some ATC Projects are open to US volunteer participation. These projects inspire intercultural collaboration and mutual educational exchange as local and foreign participants share skills and knowledge on the work site. These volunteer trips aid in creating cross-cultural understanding while addressing issues surrounding poverty in the developing world. ATC projects empower local communities to decide what technology is needed, build it, use it and plan for maintenance. ATC also runs a women's education and social venture business incubation program called ‚ÄúMayan Power and Light‚Äù in which young Mayan women study solar power installation, electrical circuits and carpentry to start their own solar businesses. These solar businesses can market to low-income families who purchase small-scale systems designed to charge a LED light and a cell phone. Larger systems are also available as families scale-up their solar power systems. The availability of low-cost solar lighting will reduce weekly costs on kerosene, candles or expensive electricity bills. This allows low income families to spend extra cash on nutrition, education or health while increasing their nighttime productivity. Mayan Power and Light aims to grow a new local, green economy that empowers women in business and technical fields. MLive 06/07/2016 In 2016 ATC's Mayan Power and Light program was recognized as one of the top 100 leaders in global sustainability by United Nations Compact for Sustainable Development's Sustainia program.

ATC works with local populations in low income communities to listen, learn, understand needs and communicate possibilities. *Product Development: ATC creates collaborative design teams that include end users, local engineers, and professional mentors. ATC prototypes products at Colleges and Universities, and at the Maker Works facility in Ann Arbor Michigan. Once a new design is proven in the laboratory ATC will prototype the product in the country where it is intended to be used. Local talent is involved throughout the product development process. *Education:The ATC education program provides opportunities for qualified professional mentors, high school, undergraduate, and graduate students and World Challenge Design Teams. This program promotes a free flow of information between university students and faculty, design clients and ATC's incubated businesses. Most new products developed by ATC, World Challenge Design Teams, or mentors are disseminated online for free from the ATC Website. : :Student design teams who work with ATC are invited to prototype and test the designs in one of the ATC's facilities in Guatemala or Nicaragua. Designs are tested and data is collected in ATC client communities. : :ATC provides an opportunity for student interns, workshop employees and volunteers to participate in the product design and business development process by presenting ATC designs in rural communities, rural clinics, schools, hospitals, and community centers. This outreach demonstrates the affordability, and value of ATC products and increases acceptance in target populations. *Social Venture Business Development In 2012 ATC began working with engineering and entrepreneurial talent in developing countries to create new sustainable businesses that provide income to people living in rural villages and urban slums.

A Greek, Niphon was born in the village of Lukov√´, Himar√´ municipality, that time part of the Despotate of Epirus (modern south Albania). From an early age he went to the monastery of Geromerion (near Filiates) where he became a hesychast. Soon after he moved to the nearby monastery of Mesopotamon, where he became a monk. Niphon went to the monastic state of Mount Athos sometime after 1335, where he dedicated himself to asceticism, under the guidance of the monastic Elders, Neilos Erichiotes, Theognostos and Maximos Kausokalybites.

At that time Athos came under the protection of the Serbian Tsar Stefan Dusan, who accused him for heresy and Bogomilism, but he was successfully defended by Gregory Palamas. In 1347-8 Niphon was tried and deposed from his position as protos after being accused by fellow monks of heresy. He was succeeded by the Serbian monk Antonios. His deposition is regarded as either part of the struggles between rival religious factions that predated the Serbian control of the Athonite community or attempts of Stefan Dusan to gain control of Athos by appointing a Serbian official as its head. This intervention resulted in serious contradictions between the Greek dignitaries and the Serbs of Hilandar monastery of Athos. During 1355-63 he was again accused of heresy when his servant Bardarius revealed before dying that he had joined the Euchite movement, but was defended by Patriarch Callistus. It is considered unclear from contemporary accounts whether Niphon was a Euchite or Hesychast at that time. Niphon lived the rest of his life as a hesychast, until his death in 1411. Niphon was also the author of the first biography of Maximos Kausokalybites, his spiritual tutor. References Further reading * F. Halkin, ¬´La vie de Saint Niphon¬ª, An.

The two major classes of methods are those that use recombinant viruses (sometimes called biological nanoparticles or viral vectors) and those that use naked DNA or DNA complexes (non-viral methods). Viruses All viruses bind to their hosts and introduce their genetic material into the host cell as part of their replication cycle. This genetic material contains basic 'instructions' of how to produce more copies of these viruses, hacking the body's normal production machinery to serve the needs of the virus. The host cell will carry out these instructions and produce additional copies of the virus, leading to more and more cells becoming infected. Some types of viruses insert their genome into the host's cytoplasm, but do not actually enter the cell. Others penetrate the cell membrane disguised as protein molecules and enter the cell. There are two main types of virus infection: lytic and lysogenic. Shortly after inserting its DNA, viruses of the lytic cycle quickly produce more viruses, burst from the cell and infect more cells. Lysogenic viruses integrate their DNA into the DNA of the host cell and may live in the body for many years before responding to a trigger. The virus reproduces as the cell does and does not inflict bodily harm until it is triggered. The trigger releases the DNA from that of the host and employs it to create new viruses. Retroviruses The genetic material in retroviruses is in the form of RNA molecules, while the genetic material of their hosts is in the form of DNA. When a retrovirus infects a host cell, it will introduce its RNA together with some enzymes, namely reverse transcriptase and integrase, into the cell. This RNA molecule from the retrovirus must produce a DNA copy from its RNA molecule before it can be integrated into the genetic material of the host cell. The process of producing a DNA copy from an RNA molecule is termed reverse transcription. It is carried out by one of the enzymes carried in the virus, called reverse transcriptase. After this DNA copy is produced and is free in the nucleus of the host cell, it must be incorporated into the genome of the host cell. That is, it must be inserted into the large DNA molecules in the cell (the chromosomes). This process is done by another enzyme carried in the virus called integrase. Now that the genetic material of the virus has been inserted, it can be said that the host cell has been modified to contain new genes. If this host cell divides later, its descendants will all contain the new genes. Sometimes the genes of the retrovirus do not express their information immediately. One of the problems of gene therapy using retroviruses is that the integrase enzyme can insert the genetic material of the virus into any arbitrary position in the genome of the host; it randomly inserts the genetic material into a chromosome. If genetic material happens to be inserted in the middle of one of the original genes of the host cell, this gene will be disrupted (insertional mutagenesis). If the gene happens to be one regulating cell division, uncontrolled cell division (i.e., cancer) can occur. This problem has recently begun to be addressed by utilizing zinc finger nucleases or by including certain sequences such as the beta-globin locus control region to direct the site of integration to specific chromosomal sites. Gene therapy trials using retroviral vectors to treat X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) represent the most successful application of gene therapy to date. More than twenty patients have been treated in France and Britain, with a high rate of immune system reconstitution observed. Similar trials were restricted or halted in the USA when leukemia was reported in patients treated in the French X-SCID gene therapy trial. To date, four children in the French trial and one in the British trial have developed leukemia as a result of insertional mutagenesis by the retroviral vector. All but one of these children responded well to conventional anti-leukemia treatment. Gene therapy trials to treat SCID due to deficiency of the Adenosine Deaminase (ADA) enzyme (one form of SCID) continue with relative success in the USA, Britain, Ireland, Italy and Japan. Adenoviruses Adenoviruses are viruses that carry their genetic material in the form of double-stranded DNA. They cause respiratory, intestinal, and eye infections in humans (especially the common cold). When these viruses infect a host cell, they introduce their DNA molecule into the host. The genetic material of the adenoviruses is not incorporated (transient) into the host cell's genetic material. The DNA molecule is left free in the nucleus of the host cell, and the instructions in this extra DNA molecule are transcribed just like any other gene. The only difference is that these extra genes are not replicated when the cell is about to undergo cell division so the descendants of that cell will not have the extra gene. As a result, treatment with the adenovirus will require readministration in a growing cell population although the absence of integration into the host cell's genome should prevent the type of cancer seen in the SCID trials. This vector system has been promoted for treating cancer and indeed the first gene therapy product to be licensed to treat cancer, Gendicine, is an adenovirus. Gendicine, an adenoviral p53-based gene therapy was approved by the Chinese food and drug regulators in 2003 for treatment of head and neck cancer. Advexin, a similar gene therapy approach from Introgen, was turned down by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2008. Concerns about the safety of adenovirus vectors were raised after the 1999 death of Jesse Gelsinger while participating in a gene therapy trial. Since then, work using adenovirus vectors has focused on genetically crippled versions of the virus. Envelope protein pseudotyping of viral vectors The viral vectors described above have natural host cell populations that they infect most efficiently. Retroviruses have limited natural host cell ranges, and although adenovirus and adeno-associated virus are able to infect a relatively broader range of cells efficiently, some cell types are resistant to infection by these viruses as well. Attachment to and entry into a susceptible cell is mediated by the protein envelope on the surface of a virus. Retroviruses and adeno-associated viruses have a single protein coating their membrane, while adenoviruses are coated with both an envelope protein and fibers that extend away from the surface of the virus. The envelope proteins on each of these viruses bind to cell-surface molecules such as heparin sulfate, which localizes them upon the surface of the potential host, as well as with the specific protein receptor that either induces entry- promoting structural changes in the viral protein, or localizes the virus in endosomes wherein acidification of the lumen induces this refolding of the viral coat. In either case, entry into potential host cells requires a favorable interaction between a protein on the surface of the virus and a protein on the surface of the cell. For the purposes of gene therapy, one might either want to limit or expand the range of cells susceptible to transduction by a gene therapy vector. To this end, many vectors have been developed in which the endogenous viral envelope proteins have been replaced by either envelope proteins from other viruses, or by chimeric proteins. Such chimera would consist of those parts of the viral protein necessary for incorporation into the virion as well as sequences meant to interact with specific host cell proteins. Viruses in which the envelope proteins have been replaced as described are referred to as pseudotyped viruses. For example, the most popular retroviral vector for use in gene therapy trials has been the lentivirus Simian immunodeficiency virus coated with the envelope proteins, G-protein, from Vesicular stomatitis virus. This vector is referred to as VSV G-pseudotyped lentivirus, and infects an almost universal set of cells. This tropism is characteristic of the VSV G-protein with which this vector is coated. Many attempts have been made to limit the tropism of viral vectors to one or a few host cell populations. This advance would allow for the systemic administration of a relatively small amount of vector. The potential for off- target cell modification would be limited, and many concerns from the medical community would be alleviated. Most attempts to limit tropism have used chimeric envelope proteins bearing antibody fragments. These vectors show great promise for the development of \\"magic bullet\\" gene therapies. Replication-competent vectors A replication-competent vector called ONYX-015 is used in replicating tumor cells. It was found that in the absence of the E1B-55Kd viral protein, adenovirus caused very rapid apoptosis of infected, p53(+) cells, and this results in dramatically reduced virus progeny and no subsequent spread. Apoptosis was mainly the result of the ability of EIA to inactivate p300. In p53(-) cells, deletion of E1B 55kd has no consequence in terms of apoptosis, and viral replication is similar to that of wild-type virus, resulting in massive killing of cells. A replication- defective vector deletes some essential genes. These deleted genes are still necessary in the body so they are replaced with either a helper virus or a DNA molecule.\\"The Process of Gene Therapy.\\" Alternate Heals. 8 may 2006. Alternate Medicine, Web. 23 November 2009. Cis and trans-acting elements Replication-defective vectors always contain a ‚Äútransfer construct‚Äù. The transfer construct carries the gene to be transduced or ‚Äútransgene‚Äù. The transfer construct also carries the sequences which are necessary for the general functioning of the viral genome: packaging sequence, repeats for replication and, when needed, priming of reverse transcription. These are denominated cis-acting elements, because they need to be on the same piece of DNA as the viral genome and the gene of interest. Trans-acting elements are viral elements, which can be encoded on a different DNA molecule. For example, the viral structural proteins can be expressed from a different genetic element than the viral genome. Herpes simplex virus The herpes simplex virus is a human neurotropic virus. This is mostly examined for gene transfer in the nervous system. The wild type HSV-1 virus is able to infect neurons and evade the host immune response, but may still become reactivated and produce a lytic cycle of viral replication. Therefore, it is typical to use mutant strains of HSV-1 that are deficient in their ability to replicate. Though the latent virus is not transcriptionally apparent, it does possess neuron specific promoters that can continue to function normally. Antibodies to HSV-1 are common in humans, however complications due to herpes infection are somewhat rare. Caution for rare cases of encephalitis must be taken and this provides some rationale to using HSV-2 as a viral vector as it generally has tropism for neuronal cells innervating the urogenital area of the body and could then spare the host of severe pathology in the brain. Non-viral methods Non-viral methods present certain advantages over viral methods, with simple large scale production and low host immunogenicity being just two. Previously, low levels of transfection and expression of the gene held non- viral methods at a disadvantage; however, recent advances in vector technology have yielded molecules and techniques with transfection efficiencies similar to those of viruses. Injection of naked DNA This is the simplest method of non-viral transfection. Clinical trials carried out of intramuscular injection of a naked DNA plasmid have occurred with some success; however, the expression has been very low in comparison to other methods of transfection. In addition to trials with plasmids, there have been trials with naked PCR product, which have had similar or greater success. Cellular uptake of naked DNA is generally inefficient. Research efforts focusing on improving the efficiency of naked DNA uptake have yielded several novel methods, such as electroporation, sonoporation, and the use of a \\"gene gun\\", which shoots DNA coated gold particles into the cell using high pressure gas.https://www.scribd.com/doc/16368929/Genes-and-DNA-A-Beginners-Guide-to- Genetics-and-Its-Applications Physical methods to enhance delivery =Electroporation= Electroporation is a method that uses short pulses of high voltage to carry DNA across the cell membrane. This shock is thought to cause temporary formation of pores in the cell membrane, allowing DNA molecules to pass through. Electroporation is generally efficient and works across a broad range of cell types. However, a high rate of cell death following electroporation has limited its use, including clinical applications. More recently a newer method of electroporation, termed electron-avalanche transfection, has been used in gene therapy experiments. By using a high-voltage plasma discharge, DNA was efficiently delivered following very short (microsecond) pulses. Compared to electroporation, the technique resulted in greatly increased efficiency and less cellular damage. =Gene gun= The use of particle bombardment, or the gene gun, is another physical method of DNA transfection. In this technique, DNA is coated onto gold particles and loaded into a device which generates a force to achieve penetration of the DNA into the cells, leaving the gold behind on a \\"stopping\\" disk. =Sonoporation= Sonoporation uses ultrasonic frequencies to deliver DNA into cells. The process of acoustic cavitation is thought to disrupt the cell membrane and allow DNA to move into cells. =Magnetofection= In a method termed magnetofection, DNA is complexed to magnetic particles, and a magnet is placed underneath the tissue culture dish to bring DNA complexes into contact with a cell monolayer. =Hydrodynamic delivery= Hydrodynamic delivery involves rapid injection of a high volume of a solution into vasculature (such as into the inferior vena cava, bile duct, or tail vein). The solution contains molecules that are to be inserted into cells, such as DNA plasmids or siRNA, and transfer of these molecules into cells is assisted by the elevated hydrostatic pressure caused by the high volume of injected solution. Chemical methods to enhance delivery =Oligonucleotides= The use of synthetic oligonucleotides in gene therapy is to deactivate the genes involved in the disease process. There are several methods by which this is achieved. One strategy uses antisense specific to the target gene to disrupt the transcription of the faulty gene. Another uses small molecules of RNA called siRNA to signal the cell to cleave specific unique sequences in the mRNA transcript of the faulty gene, disrupting translation of the faulty mRNA, and therefore expression of the gene. A further strategy uses double stranded oligodeoxynucleotides as a decoy for the transcription factors that are required to activate the transcription of the target gene. The transcription factors bind to the decoys instead of the promoter of the faulty gene, which reduces the transcription of the target gene, lowering expression. Additionally, single stranded DNA oligonucleotides have been used to direct a single base change within a mutant gene. The oligonucleotide is designed to anneal with complementarity to the target gene with the exception of a central base, the target base, which serves as the template base for repair. This technique is referred to as oligonucleotide mediated gene repair, targeted gene repair, or targeted nucleotide alteration. =Lipoplexes= To improve the delivery of the new DNA into the cell, the DNA must be protected from damage and positively charged. Initially, anionic and neutral lipids were used for the construction of lipoplexes for synthetic vectors. However, in spite of the facts that there is little toxicity associated with them, that they are compatible with body fluids and that there was a possibility of adapting them to be tissue specific; they are complicated and time consuming to produce so attention was turned to the cationic versions. Cationic lipids, due to their positive charge, were first used to condense negatively charged DNA molecules so as to facilitate the encapsulation of DNA into liposomes. Later it was found that the use of cationic lipids significantly enhanced the stability of lipoplexes. Also as a result of their charge, cationic liposomes interact with the cell membrane, endocytosis was widely believed as the major route by which cells uptake lipoplexes. Endosomes are formed as the results of endocytosis, however, if genes can not be released into cytoplasm by breaking the membrane of endosome, they will be sent to lysosomes where all DNA will be destroyed before they could achieve their functions. It was also found that although cationic lipids themselves could condense and encapsulate DNA into liposomes, the transfection efficiency is very low due to the lack of ability in terms of ‚Äúendosomal escaping‚Äù. However, when helper lipids (usually electroneutral lipids, such as DOPE) were added to form lipoplexes, much higher transfection efficiency was observed. Later on, it was figured out that certain lipids have the ability to destabilize endosomal membranes so as to facilitate the escape of DNA from endosome, therefore those lipids are called fusogenic lipids. Although cationic liposomes have been widely used as an alternative for gene delivery vectors, a dose dependent toxicity of cationic lipids were also observed which could limit their therapeutic usages. The most common use of lipoplexes has been in gene transfer into cancer cells, where the supplied genes have activated tumor suppressor control genes in the cell and decrease the activity of oncogenes. Recent studies have shown lipoplexes to be useful in transfecting respiratory epithelial cells. =Polymersomes= Polymersomes are synthetic versions of liposomes (vesicles with a lipid bilayer), made of amphiphilic block copolymers. They can encapsulate either hydrophilic or hydrophobic contents and can be used to deliver cargo such as DNA, proteins, or drugs to cells. Advantages of polymersomes over liposomes include greater stability, mechanical strength, blood circulation time, and storage capacity. =Polyplexes= Complexes of polymers with DNA are called polyplexes. Most polyplexes consist of cationic polymers and their fabrication is based on self-assembly by ionic interactions. One important difference between the methods of action of polyplexes and lipoplexes is that polyplexes cannot directly release their DNA load into the cytoplasm. As a result, co- transfection with endosome-lytic agents such as inactivated adenovirus was required to facilitate nanoparticle escape from the endocytic vesicle made during particle uptake. However, a better understanding of the mechanisms by which DNA can escape from endolysosomal pathway, i.e. proton sponge effect, has triggered new polymer synthesis strategies such as incorporation of protonable residues in polymer backbone and has revitalized research on polycation-based systems. Due to their low toxicity, high loading capacity, and ease of fabrication, polycationic nanocarriers demonstrate great promise compared to their rivals such as viral vectors which show high immunogenicity and potential carcinogenicity, and lipid-based vectors which cause dose dependence toxicity. Polyethyleneimine and chitosan are among the polymeric carriers that have been extensively studied for development of gene delivery therapeutics. Other polycationic carriers such as poly(beta-amino esters) and polyphosphoramidate are being added to the library of potential gene carriers. In addition to the variety of polymers and copolymers, the ease of controlling the size, shape, surface chemistry of these polymeric nano-carriers gives them an edge in targeting capability and taking advantage of enhanced permeability and retention effect. =Dendrimers= A dendrimer is a highly branched macromolecule with a spherical shape. The surface of the particle may be functionalized in many ways and many of the properties of the resulting construct are determined by its surface. In particular it is possible to construct a cationic dendrimer, i.e. one with a positive surface charge. When in the presence of genetic material such as DNA or RNA, charge complementarity leads to a temporary association of the nucleic acid with the cationic dendrimer. On reaching its destination the dendrimer-nucleic acid complex is then taken into the cell via endocytosis. In recent years the benchmark for transfection agents has been cationic lipids. Limitations of these competing reagents have been reported to include: the lack of ability to transfect some cell types, the lack of robust active targeting capabilities, incompatibility with animal models, and toxicity. Dendrimers offer robust covalent construction and extreme control over molecule structure, and therefore size. Together these give compelling advantages compared to existing approaches. Producing dendrimers has historically been a slow and expensive process consisting of numerous slow reactions, an obstacle that severely curtailed their commercial development. The Michigan-based company Dendritic Nanotechnologies discovered a method to produce dendrimers using kinetically driven chemistry, a process that not only reduced cost by a magnitude of three, but also cut reaction time from over a month to several days. These new \\"Priostar\\" dendrimers can be specifically constructed to carry a DNA or RNA payload that transfects cells at a high efficiency with little or no toxicity. =Inorganic nanoparticles= Inorganic nanoparticles, such as gold, silica, iron oxide (ex. magnetofection) and calcium phosphates have been shown to be capable of gene delivery. Some of the benefits of inorganic vectors is in their storage stability, low manufacturing cost and often time, low immunogenicity, and resistance to microbial attack. Nanosized materials less than 100 nm have been shown to efficiently trap the DNA or RNA and allows its escape from the endosome without degradation. Inorganics have also been shown to exhibit improved in vitro transfection for attached cell lines due to their increased density and preferential location on the base of the culture dish. Quantum dots have also been used successfully and permits the coupling of gene therapy with a stable fluorescence marker. Engineered organic nanoparticles are also under development, which could be used for co-delivery of genes and therapeutic agents. =Cell-penetrating peptides= Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), also known as peptide transduction domains (PTDs), are short peptides (< 40 amino acids) that efficiently pass through cell membranes while being covalently or non-covalently bound to various molecules, thus facilitating these molecules‚Äô entry into cells. Cell entry occurs primarily by endocytosis but other entry mechanisms also exist. Examples of cargo molecules of CPPs include nucleic acids, liposomes, and drugs of low molecular weight. CPP cargo can be directed into specific cell organelles by incorporating localization sequences into CPP sequences. For example, nuclear localization sequences are commonly used to guide CPP cargo into the nucleus. For guidance into mitochondria, a mitochondrial targeting sequence can be used; this method is used in protofection (a technique that allows for foreign mitochondrial DNA to be inserted into cells' mitochondria). Hybrid methods Due to every method of gene transfer having shortcomings, there have been some hybrid methods developed that combine two or more techniques. Virosomes are one example; they combine liposomes with an inactivated HIV or influenza virus. This has been shown to have more efficient gene transfer in respiratory epithelial cells than either viral or liposomal methods alone. Other methods involve mixing other viral vectors with cationic lipids or hybridising viruses.

It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on July 14, 2011. In the episode, Grimes is outraged by the unsatisfying ending of his favorite television series, and Mark helps him unravel his attachment to the series while uncovering several deep-seated memories. Meanwhile, Callie is expected to take over as the leader of Hell from her father, but is unwilling to do so. The episode was written by Mike Rowe and directed by Aaron Augenblick and series creator Devin Clark. While the series' first season mainly referenced horror films, \\"Ride Me to Hell\\" pays homage to 1970s cop shows. Clark used Grimes unleashing his memories from the 1970s as an opportunity to parody cop shows such as CHiPs and Starsky and Hutch. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Ride Me to Hell\\" was watched by 814,000 viewers in its original airing, a slight drop in total viewership when compared to previous episodes. The episode received positive reviews. Plot Frank Grimes' favorite television series, Dishonorable Discharge, ends after six seasons and it is revealed that the entire series was just an angel's dream. Grimes is outraged and determined to change the ending. Later, Mark Lilly tells his girlfriend, the half-demon Callie Maggotbone, that he has not seen his father since his sixth birthday. Mark's roommate, the zombie Randall, is touched by this and decides to document Mark's journey to find his father, so that he can become a Hollywood director. Mark is assigned by Twayne Boneraper to investigate Grimes, who has been busting people who enjoyed the ending of Dishonorable Discharge. He and Randall (who documents everything with his video camera) ride along with Grimes. In a memory sequence of Grimes', it is revealed that he was a real cop in the 1970s and worked with an undercover expert named Jimmy. He was dishonorably discharged from the force and repressed all of his memories of being a cop. Mark figures that this is why he is so angry with the ending of the series, and takes him through his past by using the same car Grimes and his partner Jimmy had. In the car, Grimes has a memory sequence again and drives to Hollywood. Meanwhile, Aldermach Maggotbone is ready to hand over his title as the leader of Hell to his daughter, Callie. However, Callie does not want to take over his job. A competition is held to choose which one will overtake the title and Callie tries to lose every challenge, but Twayne makes sure that she wins each time. At the studio where Dishonorable Discharge was filmed, Grimes forces some bystanders to act in his ending of the series, which reveals the memory Grimes had repressed: While trying to take down Aldermach when he became the new leader of Hell, Grimes accidentally killed a disguised Jimmy. In present time, Mark, Grimes and Randall head back to New York to sabotage the new ceremony. At the ceremony, Aldermach unexpectedly chooses to give the Slitherix (a big snake one has to swallow to become the leader of Hell) to his secretary, Cathy, to spare Callie from getting the job. Just as Cathy is about to receive the snake, Grimes crashes the car into the church and shoots her. It is then revealed that she is really Grimes' old partner Jimmy, who had worked undercover in Hell for 35 years. Embarrassed, Grimes begins to repress his memories again, which Mark believes is for the best. The episode ends with an angel waking up, suggesting that the episode was her dream. Production Aaron Augenblick co-directed \\"Ride Me to Hell\\". \\"Ride Me to Hell\\" was written by Mike Rowe and directed by Aaron Augenblick and series creator Devin Clark. Screenwriter and executive producer Daniel Powell said that the episode explores \\"a little bit more\\" about Mark's background, particularly that his father left him when he was younger, and that it \\"sort of informs why he became a social worker\\". Unlike the series' first season, which paid homage mainly to horror films, season two referenced a variety of genres. In an interview with Matt Barone of the magazine Complex, Clark used \\"Ride Me to Hell\\" as an example that the season \\"taps into a little bit beyond the horror culture\\". He referred it to as \\"one of our big episodes\\" and stated that it references contemporary shows with \\"unsatisfied endings\\", such as Monk and Lost. In the episode, Grimes unleashes memories of being a cop in the 1970s, which Clark saw as an opportunity to make fun of 1970s cop shows, such as CHiPs and Starsky and Hutch. He said, \\"It's always a fun opportunity to see what other worlds I can pull from, even beyond horror. We had some really fun opportunities this season to pull from old '70s cop shows. ... So, it's fun for me just to step out and try lots of different styles and looks. I'm excited for whatever the writers throw at me, thematically. It's just a new opportunity to try something different.\\" \\"Ride Me to Hell\\" was the fifth episode to be produced for the second season. In addition to the regular cast, the episode features appearances by recurring guest voice actors Pete Holmes, Julie Klausner and Mike O'Gorman. Reception The episode originally aired in the United States on Comedy Central on July 14, 2011. According to Nielsen Media Research, it was watched by 814,000 viewers and acquired a 0.4 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. The episode slightly dropped in terms of total viewership from the previous episode, \\"Callie and Her Sister\\", which was watched by 980,000 viewers. \\"Ride Me to Hell\\" received a positive review from Ology's Josh Harrison, who commented that it \\"successfully redeemed\\" the character Grimes, who was his least-favorite character up until this episode. Harrison wrote, \\"I'm thrilled to see Grimes shine in his starring role. Admittedly this episode was a bit light on isolated funny incidents ... but Randall's director-speak was a solid throughline, and I'm always happy to see more demon politics.\\" Harrison graded the episode 8.7 out of 10 and remarked that \\"it was a cut above its predecessors this season, but still a bit shy of the very best UA [episodes]\\".

Basically a line drive hitter and speedy base runner, she collected over 25 stolen bases in five of her eight seasons in the league. An instinctive player with good hands and a strong throwing arm, she also was capable of playing well all three outfield positions. But her best attribute may have been able to adapt and perform well for nine teams and thirteen different rosters in a span of eight years. Meier entered the league in 1946 with the Rockford Peaches, playing for them one and a half years before joining the Fort Wayne Daisies (1947). Then she found herself on the move again, this time to the Peoria Redwings (1948) and Chicago Colleens (1948), and then the Muskegon Lassies (1949), Racine Belles (1949), Kalamazoo Lassies (1950), followed by a new trip to Fort Wayne (1950‚Äì1952). She later was part of the Battle Creek Belles (1952) and played her last season for the Muskegon Belles (1953). In her rookie year, Meier appeared in 103 games and hit a .249 batting average with a career-high 49 runs batted in while scoring 44 times. Her most productive season came in 1948, when she posted career numbers in hits (100), at-bats (450), runs scored (54), stolen bases (55) and games played (127), adding a .222 average and 47 RBI. She raised her average to a career-high .261 in 1950, while collecting a second- best 34 stolen bases in 99 games. In 1951, Meier suffered a season-ending compound fracture of her right ankle while sliding into second base.

Time is running short before their next program. Deke, to his astonishment, spots a dead ringer for his wife on the street. He tracks down the woman, Sylvia Latour, and persuades her to impersonate Della on the TV show. The scheme fools the audience from a resemblance standpoint, but Sylvia cannot remember her lines. Della takes pity on Deke and trades places, getting the program back on track.

The panels depict swirling Tree of life, a standing female figure and an embracing couple. The mosaics form a part of a larger commission by Belgian financier Adolphe Stoclet and his wife Suzanne. The Stoclets hired architect Josef Hoffmann and the Wiener Werkst√§tte artistic collective to design, decorate and furnish a spacious mansion with formal gardens. The pair were avid art collectors with wide-ranging and eclectic tastes: their collection included work from a range of periods and cultures, from the Far East to the New WorldFreytag 2010, 339. and included Egyptian sculpture, Chinese ceramics and jades, Byzantine icons and jewelry, miniatures from Persia and Armenia, as well as numerous Western mediaeval paintings.Warlick 1992, 119. The diverse tastes of his patrons corresponded well with Klimt's own. Art historian M.E. Warlick notes that he \\"must have been delighted to find that their eclectic collection so matched many of his own recent interests\\". The panels were commissioned and placed along three walls of the Palais' dining room, with the two larger, figural sections set across from each other along the longer walls of the room. A smaller geometric panel occupies the short wall separating them. The designs are decorated with a variety of luxury materials, including marble, ceramic, gilded tiles and enamel along with pearls and other semi- precious stones.Freytag 2010, 365. When an official party of Belgian architects visited the Palais Stoclet (1905-1911) in Brussels for the very first time, on 22 September 1912, the excitement amongst it members was great. Everything from the Palais Stoclet's ground plan to its silver spoons had been designed and executed by the Austrian architect Josef Hoffmann and the artists and craftsmen of the Wiener Werkst√§tte (‚ÄòViennese Workshop‚Äô). Amidst the historicist fa√ßades lining the elegant avenue de Tervuren, the entire ensemble of house, garden and interior ‚Äì culminating in the dining room with the celebrated Tree of Life frieze by Gustav Klimt ‚Äì struck the Belgian architects as belonging to another world. \\"I think I'm on the planet Mars!\\" exclaimed one of the architects in disbelief during his visit.

Trained by James Fanshawe in Newmarket, he enjoyed a successful career, particularly as a four-year-old when he won five of his six starts which were all in either handicap or group company. Among the most notable achievements in his career include winning the Wokingham Stakes at Royal Ascot and the Group 2 British Champions Sprint Stakes, Five on the bounce for Deacon Blues. by 1 ¬Ω lengths, also at Ascot. Racing career Two-year-old season Deacon Blues made his racing debut on October 7, 2009, in a six furlong maiden race at Nottingham. Ridden by George Baker, he finished fifth at odds of 25/1 but showed some early promise by staying on well in the closing stages. He then turned out at Leicester 19 days later and won his first ever race, the EBF Fosse Way Maiden Stakes, by 1 ¬º lengths, as the well supported 7/4 favourite. Three-year-old season He made his three-year-old debut in a handicap at Doncaster on April 17, 2010, where he finished third at odds of 5/1. He went one better next time out, finishing second at Nottingham, before he gained his first victory of the season in taking style at Yarmouth in June. However, that was to be his only win as a three-year-old as he started to earn a reputation for being an unlucky sprinter, with placed efforts in three of his next five starts in 2010. Four-year-old season Deacon Blues made his seasonal re-appearance in a big field handicap at Ascot in May, where he finished runner-up by a neck to Imperial Guest. However, that was to be his only defeat as a four year-old. First he landed the Wokingham Stakes at Royal Ascot with an impressive turn of foot ‚Äì a performance which hinted that a step up to group company could be in the offing. He duly obliged in the Group 3 Shadwell Stakes at Newbury on his next appearance, winning comfortably by 2 ¬æ lengths from Markab. He then thrashed a small field by seven lengths in the Phoenix Sprint Stakes at the Curragh before returning to Newbury in September to land another Group 3, this time the Dubai International World Trophy over five furlongs., Deacon Blues' Newbury romp strengthens Champions Day hopes. His final start of the season was in the Group 2 British Champions Sprint Stakes, the biggest race of his career to date. He was sent off the 5/2 favourite and didn‚Äôt disappoint, winning by 1 ¬Ω lengths to cap a memorable season. Injury In March 2012, Deacon Blues suffered a tendon injury which ruled him out of the entire 2012 season. He sustained a small tear in his near fore tendon, and he was given an estimated recovery time of one year. Two weeks before a possible tilt at the Diamond Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot in June 2013, he suffered another tendon injury which led to connections retiring him at the age of six.http://royal- ascot.racingpost.com/news/horse-racing/injury-forces-classy-deacon-blues-into- retirement/1289839/ References 2007 racehorse births Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Byerley Turk sire line ","title":"Deacon Blues (horse)"},{"id":"34217408","text":"The Ratbites From Hell were a West Country rock band active between 1972‚Äì1975, many of whose members subsequently played in key bands of the later 70's, as punk and new wave revived the London and New York music scenes. The basic Ratbites line-up was Huw Gower and John Perry on guitar/vocals, Roy Sundholm on bass/vocals, Nick Howell and/or Alan Platt on drums, 'Big' Pete Thorpe on vocals and Pete Biles on congas, 1972‚Äì75 When the psychedelic band Magic Muscle split in January 1973, remaining members Huw Gower and Pete Biles recruited guitarist John Perry, bassist Roy Sundholm and drummer Nick Howell to fulfill existing MM gig commitments; their nascent band (Over The Hill)'s fourth member, singer/songwriter Pete Roe served out the remaining six months of his contract as a journalist with a national daily. Joined by lead singer 'Big' Pete Thorpe, this temporary line-up became MM 2 and were soon playing shows with Hawkwind. Dave Brock rated the new band and recommended them to producer Don Paul who cut two songs on them including Huw Gower's majestic 'Sparkle'. MM2's last appearance was at the l Trentishoe Festival in Devon (July '73) after which the MM name was retired for a while. Gower formed 'Stroll On', joined by Howell. The two groups jammed together in the summer of 1974 and the same core musicians who played at Trentishoe once more reformed as The Ratbites From Hell and played shows throughout the UK. In August 1975 The Ratbites toured the Netherlands, playing a dozen cities from Groningen to Rotterdam. They also recorded for United Artists. The band has never officially split up, though shows these days are rare. A line-up was last seen playing at The Nashville Rooms in London in early 1978. Subsequent careers Huw Gower was spotted by Will Birch at the Ratbites Nashville gig,] and recruited to play guitar for The Records. Gower co-wrote the groups‚Äô US top 40 chart hit ‚ÄôStarry Eyes‚Äô, cut records with Rachel Sweet, Nick Lowe, The Sinceros, Henry McCulloch, Carlene Carter and in New York with ex-New York Dolls vocalist David Johansen/Buster Poindexter, Graham Parker & Roseanne Cash. His 1984 solo record 'Guitarophilia', highly rated by the NY Times' music critic Robert Palmer lead to a second career as a producer, a role he'd begun during his spell with The Records and more solo releases; 'Ile de France' in 2000 and 'In Pursuit of Excellence, 2003. In 2012 he formed IceCream Skyscraper with 'Mad' Mike Cullens. The band's well received first album, 'Granite, With Rainbow Sprinkles' was released later that same year. Alan Platt formed the Solid Senders with Dr. Feelgood guitarist Wilko Johnson. Their debut album included his original tune 'First Thing in the Morning', featuring his lead vocal. He and co-writer Simon Climie were signed to Ringo Starr's publishing company, who placed one of their tunes on a single release by Connie Francis (Comme Ci, Comme Ca). Subsequently Alan relocated to his native Scotland, where he was active in the blues band 'Bottleneck'. He died in 2006. John Perry met Peter Perrett when a drunken Peter Biles fell offstage at a London show in autumn 1975, landing on (future- Only One) Peter Perrett's wife, Xena. From this inauspicious start Perrett and Perry began recording songs at a demo studio in Tooting. Five songsWatch You Drown, My Rejection, Be Your Friend, Don't Hold Your Breath. These tracks subsequently emerged on the posthumous album Remains: were laid down with Perry playing bass and guitar, Glenn Tilbrook on guitar and Gordon Edwards (Kinks and Pretty Things) on keyboards.Liner notes 'Remains' album. Within months drummer Mike Kellie and bassist Alan Mair joined and the Only Ones line-up was finalised in mid-1976. The Only Ones reformed in 2007 and in the intervening years John's guitar was frequently heard on recordings by The Sisters of Mercy, Robert Palmer, Evan Dando and many more. He also found time to author three books, including a highly acclaimed analysis of The Rolling Stones' masterpiece 'Exile on Main Street'. Roy Sundholm released an album of original material'The Chinese Method' on Ensign Records, in 1978 which featured Alan Platt on drums. Nick Howell joined The Snivelling Shits alongside Giovanni Dadomo, Pete Makowski, Barry Myers and sometime bassist Steve Lillywhite. Their album I Can't Come was released on the Damaged Goods label. Nick later joined John's band Decline and Fall. He died in 2005. By 1977 the various Ratbites had moved on but John and Alan can be heard, separately, on one double album. If any one record reflects the atmosphere of 1976/7, as the London music scene adapted to (or ignored) the challenge of punk, it's probably the Hope & Anchor Front Row Festival. Recorded live over 3 weeks in Nov/December 1977 it features the Only Ones, and the Wilko Johnson Band. Discography Album Ratbite Fever, a bootlegged collection of demos and live tracks by Over The Hill, which included John, Roy and Alan along with Pete Roe, was released by World Wide Records SPM-CD-0006 Zippo Records' former CEO Pete Flanagan has yet to release tracks he cut of originals by Gower, accompanied by Perry, Howell and ex-MM Ade Shaw on bass, and also is thought to have a copy of the UA sessions, featuring Gowers' 'TV Blues'.

Background  The song was written before the release of Wings' second album, Red Rose Speedway, but not recorded until the Band on the Run sessions.  Recording  The basic track was recorded in Lagos, Nigeria and was later completed in September in England. The orchestral arrangements, consisting of brass instruments and string quartets were made by Tony Visconti. Ian Horne and Trevor Jones, two of Wings' roadies, sang backing vocals on the track although their parts are buried in the mix. Otherwise, the vocals consist primarily of Laine and Paul and Linda McCartney all singing together, with Laine and Paul McCartney each taking a solo spot. The song's verses are in the key of A major. The key moves to the dominant, E major, for the refrain. The lyrics express the singer's desire for a woman who he fears may not be only interested in him. The refrain consists of the single line \\"No words for my love.\\" Music author Vincent Benitex interprets the song's ending on a dominant key rather than the tonic as reflecting the singer's uncertain situation. Robert Rodriguez described \\"No Words\\" as being the only song on Band on the Run that came close to being the type of \\"silly love song\\" that predominated McCartney's albums of the time.

It was the most significant witch trial in Denmark since the Rosborg witch trials of 1639, and caused a wave of new witch trials on Jylland after a period of diminishing witch hunts. The case led to the issue of a new law banning local courts from handing down and enacting death sentences without confirmation of the national high court, a law which interrupted the local witch hunt and eventually stopped it nationwide.  The Trials  In 1683, the first witch trial in Denmark since 1652 caused a witch hysteria in the nation. In September 1685, a woman by the name of Mette was put on trial in Ebeltoft, accused by her neighbors for having killed their horses by the use of magic. The previous year Mette had sworn to take revenge on the neighbors when they refused to help her, and eventually the horses had died without identifiable cause. Mette was placed in the prison dungeon at Rug√•rd manor, the residence of the nobleman J√∏rgen Arenfeldt, who had the authority to issue private sentences. At Christmas 1686, Arenfeldt and three visiting priests conducted a private interrogation on Mette, and she was judged to be guilty and executed upon the consent of Judge Lerche. In Ebeltoft, bailiff Hans Jacobsen had four suspects arrested, tried on water and two of them burnt at the stake. In parallel, J√∏rgen Arenfeldt continued his witch trial on Rug√•rd manor, where he had Gye Nielsdatter confess to witches companies, devil's mark, and devil's pact. Nielsdatter was made to point out accomplices and then sentenced to be burnt, which was carried out in March 1686. Arenfeldt also had Anne S√∏rensdatter, who was rumored to have clairvoyance, arrested together with her mother, despite the fact that they lived outside of his legal jurisdiction. He forced Anne S√∏rensdatter to name a number of accomplices, among them some powerful people, and then had her and her mother sentenced to death. The witch trials on Rug√•rd manor and Ebeltoft were marked by private interrogations, illegal use of torture, the use of ordeal of water and the needle test. The accused were exposed to religious arguments by priests, who convinced the accused of their guilt. They caused a chain of witch trials on Eastern Jylland in the year of 1686. During his interrogation of Anne S√∏rensdatter, J√∏rgen Arenfeldt had been given the names of several powerful people, who were then in turn accused of being witches. Because of this Arenfeldt himself was summoned to √Öhus 14 July 1686 for questioning. On 21 July 1686, a new law was issued which banned all local courts from executing death sentences without confirmation from the national high court, a regulation that effectively terminated all witch trials by early 1687. In September 1686, Arenfeldt was sentenced guilty of having acquiring the names that denounced powerful people as witches from Anne S√∏rensdatter by the illegal use of torture, and in November he was fined and deprived of his right to conduct private trials. The witch trials in the rest of Denmark were to continue in the following years, with the last of the witch trials in Denmark that lead to a death sentence being that of Anne Palles in 1693.

Abe Rich (died November 25, 2008) was a wood craftsman and Holocaust survivor. He was inducted into the International Cuemakers Hall of Fame for the quality of the pool cue sticks he produced. The Holocaust Abraham Rutzisky was the son of Chaim and Hodel Rutzisky (sometimes rendered as Rutzaisky), a woodworker in Lithuania. Chaim Rutzisky was a Spundturner, making bungs for beer kegs. A secular Jew, he was well-educated and spoke Lithuanian and Polish. In World War II, Germany invaded Lithuania (earlier absorbed by the Soviet Union) on June 22, 1941. Rutzisky was recruited by partisans because of his non-Jewish appearance, education and language skills; the partisans promised to help get his family to safety. He, however was recognized, denounced as a Jew, and shot. His wife and his youngest son, two- year-old Shlomo, were also killed during the war. His other sons, Morris and Abe, were assigned as woodturners in the workshops established in the Kovno Ghetto (July‚ÄìOctober 1941). These were issued two of the 5000 Jordan passes (Jordan-Scheine) given to \\"useful Jews\\" and named after the ghetto‚Äôs S.A. Hauptsturmfuehrer Fritz Jordan.Klein 22 The brothers were seen as valuable for their ability to make chess pieces and toys for the children of SS men. One day, an SS officer came in to demand a repair or replacement to an ivory cigarette holder which had been a gift from his father. He struck Abe. Abe never recovered from this injury, and became a deformed hunchback, 5‚Äô 3‚Äô‚Äô tall as an adult. His appearance somewhat accounts for the fact that he never married. Having nearly starved to death, he suffered from chronic gastritis.Martinez Morris created a perfect replica of the cigarette holder out of cow bone. Impressed by the workmanship of the finished object, the officer declared, \\"Hitler lied.\\" Until his transfer, this SS man smuggled food to the boys, which proved important to their survival. The Kovno Ghetto was destroyed in October 1941, with 10,000 Jews being shot dead at the Ninth Fort on October 29. Approximately 3,000 of the 37,000 Jews living in Kovno survived the war, 500 of them by hiding in the forest, and 2,500 in German concentration camps. The boys were sent to the Dachau concentration camp in Bavaria. Their woodworking skills again proved invaluable to their survival. They made clogs and canteens, and later internal scaffolding for the hangars the Germans erected to shield their aircraft from Allied reconnaissance and attack. Survival was by the barest of margins: Morris weighed and Abe when they were liberated in April 1945. They were sent to the Benedictine St. Ottilien Archabbey in Landsberg to recuperate. Morris was an invaluable witness in the Dachau War Crimes trial because of his photographic memory and the length of time the brothers had spent in the ghetto. Morris personally identified the former commandant, Martin Gottfried Weiss, who was hanged on May 29, 1946. By the time the proceedings ended, the window for Jewish refugees provided by the Truman Declaration had shut. Abe moved to Israel, where he worked in the Negev from 1948-1960 on road construction. He emigrated to the United States in 1960. Emigration to America In the 60s with a treasure trove of wood From 1962 to 1965, he worked for the Rich Q company, founded by his uncle Izzy's son Sol. The company was located first in the Bowery, New York City, then later on Long Island. The 29th Street shop today Impressed with the apparent success of the enterprise, he interested his brother Morris in a similar venture. In 1965, they founded Florida Cues on 29th Street in Miami. The 4000 square foot facility, including an 800 square foot showroom, was principally dedicated to Richwood Turning. Misunderstandings developed between the brother-partners, and in 1973 Abe started a new business, Star Cues. Abe, having worked at Rich Cue for three years, produced many pool cues at Star which bear a familial resemblance to his cousin's output. He favored Merry Widow forearms, and Brazilian Rosewood was often used, although he was also fond of more exotic materials. He stored hundreds of blanks of Goncalo Alves, Kingwood, Canadian Maple, Zebrawood and Macassar Ebony, which dried year after year under the tarpaper roof. Merry Widows formed the basis of his production, although Abe did a number of Titleist conversions. He was particularly fond of Delrin trim rings and Ivorine-3 ferrules, assembling his cues with his own, top secret epoxy blend.Martinez Like his New York relatives, Abe did not lack for star customers at Star Cues; Minnesota Fats, Willie Mosconi, and Jackie Gleason (who played Minnesota Fats in the 1961 film The Hustler) all bought cues from him.Howard Rich qtd. in Martinez Sources *\\"Abe Rich Passes Away.\\" Forums.AZBilliards.com.

The presidential election coincided with U.S. Senate, U.S. House, and gubernatorial elections in several states. The election marked the end of the Fourth Party System and the start of the Fifth Party System. The election is widely considered to be a realigning election, and the newly established Democratic New Deal coalition experienced much more success than their predecessors had in the Fourth Party System. Democratic New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt defeated Republican incumbent President Herbert Hoover in a landslide, with Hoover winning only six Northeastern states. Roosevelt's victory was the first by a Democratic candidate since Woodrow Wilson won re- election in 1916. Roosevelt took his party's nomination on the fourth ballot, defeating 1928 nominee Al Smith and Speaker of the House John Nance Garner. The Republicans suffered massive defeats in both congressional chambers: Democrats gained ninety-seven seats in the House of Representatives, increasing their majority over the Republicans (achieving a House supermajority in doing so), and took control of the Senate, gaining twelve seats from the Republicans, who had controlled the Senate since their electoral success in 1918. The election took place after the 1930 United States Census and the subsequent Congressional re-apportionment. The Reapportionment Act of 1929 provided a permanent method of apportioning 435 House seats; previously, Congress had had to pass apportionment legislation after each census.

His most high-profile role was that of chief Far East correspondent for BBC Radio during the Vietnam War. He died in Hong Kong on 24 September 2013.http://7thspace.com/headlines/445327/ce_saddened_by_death_of_mr_anthony_lawrence.html Early life Lawrence was born in Wimbledon, London, the fourth of five children. Lawrence described his primary school as being \\"in a rough neighbourhood\\" where the headmaster periodically had to make appeals for shoes to give some of the poorer pupils, who would otherwise come to school barefoot. He later attended King's College School. Lawrence believed journalism was in his blood, with an uncle and his grandfather both having worked in newspapers, and following on secondary school he worked for a variety of London weeklies. He served in World War II in the British Army, in the Royal Artillery in Europe, where he achieved the rank of captain. He was later assigned to the British Forces' Information Control Unit in Germany. Journalism career Lawrence claimed to have been inspired to enter journalism by his \\"wicked uncle\\" Arthur Lawrence, a successful journalist, editor and author, and Diplomatic Correspondent of the Daily Mail. Lawrence began his career in journalism with local newspapers before the interruption of World War II. In Germany at the end of the war in 1945, his career was renewed first when he was involved in the launch of Die Zeit, and later when he joined the BBC World Service in London in 1945. He was posted to Singapore as the BBC Radio Far East correspondent in 1956, and was then transferred to Hong Kong in 1958. The Radio Times referred to him as \\"a BBC man of the old school: courtly, cultured, gentle, polite.‚Äù During his period with the BBC, Lawrence was involved with two documentaries, \\"Born Chinese\\" and \\"From Our Correspondent\\". He remained with the service until 1973, and continued after this with the occasional contribution, including BBC World Service live coverage of the ceremony of Hong Kong's transition from British to Chinese rule in 1997. He was interviewed in 1972 on the BBC radio programme Desert Island Discs by Roy Plomley. Toward the end of his news career he wrote his first book, Foreign Correspondent. Family life Lawrence lost his first wife, Sylvia, who was expecting their first child, while she was in a hostel for expectant mothers. This was during the Second World War, and the building received a direct hit in an air raid; she had ironically gone there for fear of the raids. Lawrence married a German woman, Irmgard Noll, in 1946, and frequently referred in interviews to the importance of his second wife's support and assistance during his career in the Far East. His son Alex, aged 8 at the time of his move to Singapore, was \\"bribed\\" to accept the transition with the offer of a pet monkey. On their move to Hong Kong, Alex had to be sent to boarding school in England. Lawrence outlived both his wife Irmgard (who died in 2001) and son Alex. Retirement Lawrence retired to Hong Kong, and continued to be active, including authorship of several more books. His activities included a period as President of the Foreign Correspondents' Club, and involvement as a volunteer with the International Social Services, where he became chairman in 1988, and which has a refuge named after him. Lawrence was active in support for education programmes for Vietnamese refugee children detained in Hong Kong, and also urged the authorities to action in reuniting immigrant families from Mainland China. Lawrence was awarded an OBE in the 2013 New Year Honours List for services to the community in Hong Kong. He turned 100 in August 2012.

Taking place shortly after the start of the Great Depression, the Republican Party suffered substantial losses. The election was the last of the Fourth Party System, and marked the first time since 1918 that Democrats controlled either chamber of Congress. The Republicans lost fifty-two seats to the Democratic Party in the House of Representatives. While the Republicans maintained a one-seat majority after the polls closed, they lost a number of special elections (since some Republican members died) before the start of the new congress. This allowed the Democrats to take control of that chamber with a one-seat majority. The Republicans also lost eight seats to the Democrats in the U.S. Senate, but were able to maintain control with Republican Vice President Charles Curtis casting the tie breaking vote. The election was a victory for progressives of both parties, as Republicans closely aligned with Hoover lost several Congressional elections. Additionally, New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt's landslide re-election established him as the front-runner for the 1932 Democratic nomination.

Based on a story by Dorrell and Stuart E. McGowan, the film is about a singing cowboy who comes to the aid of the townspeople of Sage City who are victims of a nefarious scam. Plot The townspeople of Sage City are celebrating the upcoming production of a motion picture in their community. The film's producers, Homer Gerard (Arthur Loft) and Ellery Gibson (Sidney Blackmer), assure the townspeople that if they invest financially in the production, that John Wayne himself will star in the movie, and the world premier will be held in Sage City, putting their community on the map. Singing cowboy Gene Autry (Gene Autry) and his sidekick Frog Millhouse (Smiley Burnette) are caught up in the excitement and host a barbecue for the town and its good fortune. Soon after, Gene discovers that the producers are in fact con artists who have swindled Sage City citizens out of $35,000. Gerard and Gibson, whose real names are Flood and Allen, travel to San Ramon, Mexico, where their bosses, the real Gerard and Gibson, are preparing to pull a similar swindle on the townspeople of San Ramon. Their primary target is the wealthy Don Carlos Alvarado (Julian Rivero), whose daughter Maria Elena (Fay McKenzie) has been promised a starring role in the film in return for his financial support. Following the con artists' trail, Gene and Frog travel to San Ramon and meet beautiful Maria Elena on the way. They tell her about how the citizens of Sage City were swindled. Gene and Frog meet the real Gibson and Gerard, but do not recognize them, but Frog does recognize their car‚Äîthe same one Flood and Allen drove in Sage City. Gene realizes that these men must be involved in some way. The following night, Gene accompanies Maria Elena to a fiesta. Afterwards, some of Gerard and Gibson's henchmen take shots at Gene, Frog, and their friend, reformed bandit Pancho Grande (Harold Huber), looking to put an end to Gene's investigation. Determined to expose the con artists' latest scheme, Gene abducts Maria Elena during the first day of filming and convinces her that something is not right. At Gene's suggestion, Maria Elena persuades her father to request that Gerard and Gibson, as a sign of good faith, invest some of their own money in the production. The swindlers agree to the request, even though they have no money in the bank. They devise a plan to hold up the bank car bringing Don Carlos' share of the investment the following day and frame Gene for the crime. When they learn about the plot, Gene and Frog go after Gerard and Gibson's henchmen while Pancho Grande reunites with his old gang who agreed to help. Following a dramatic chase, Gene captures the ringleaders and their henchmen. Afterwards, Rurale Captain Rodriguez (Thornton Edwards) gives Gene the money swindled from the citizens of Sage City, and to everyone's surprise, the former bandit Pancho Grande announces that he has become a policeman. Gene assures Maria Elena that he will return in a month to accompany her to another fiesta. Cast Production Casting Between 1941 and 1942, Fay McKenzie appeared as the leading lady in five Gene Autry films: Down Mexico Way (1941), Sierra Sue (1941), Cowboy Serenade (1942), Heart of the Rio Grande (1942), and Home in Wyomin' (1942).

It premiered on January 2, 2012 and airs weekdays from 5:00-6:00 a.m. ET. The programme is also broadcast on CNN International. History By the end of its run in 2011, CNN's American Morning had fallen behind in the morning ratings. Executive vice president Ken Jautz, who joined in September 2010, decided to revamp the network's morning lineup by canceling the show altogether and replacing it with two new programs less focused on national politics than cable rivals Fox & Friends and Morning Joe. Along with Starting Point, Early Start replaced American Morning, which aired from 2001 to 2011. Ashleigh Banfield, who co-anchored with Sambolin until July 13, 2012, has since moved to the 12pm timeslot. The new morning lineup was announced in November 2011 with Ashleigh Banfield and Zoraida Sambolin confirmed as anchors of the 5-7 a.m. program, while Soledad O'Brien joined as anchor of the 7-9 a.m. program. Banfield joined from ABC News while Sambolin was hired from WMAQ-TV. The name of the 5-7 a.m. program was announced as Early Start on Twitter on December 29. The program was subtitled News From A to Z, a reference to the first initials of the show's original co- anchors. On May 30, 2012, CNN announced ABC's John Berman would join Banfield and Sambolin as co-anchor. On June 26, 2012, CNN announced Banfield was leaving Early Start in July to anchor the 11am hour of CNN Newsroom. On December 13, 2013, Zoraida Sambolin left the show and was replaced by Christine Romans in January 2014. There was also a weekend broadcast from 6-7 a.m. ET, and was alternated between Poppy Harlow, Miguel Marquez, Alison Kosik, Randi Kaye and Victor Blackwell. It merely served as a lead-in to the subsequent five-hour CNN Newsroom, both anchored by the same host or duo. On June 22, 2013, due to the launch of New Day, it was decided that Weekend Early Start would be cancelled in favor of New Day Saturday and New Day Sunday, which would respectively run for 3¬Ω and 3 hours on their respective days. First weekend edition of New Day aired on that same day. Early Start continues on weekdays. One week leading up to the 2016 United States presidential election, Early Start ran from 3am to 5am ET, followed by an extended version of New Day from 5am to 9am ET. This schedule then becomes a standard for CNN during breaking news events. In January 2017, John Berman left the program to anchor CNN Newsroom at 9am ET. CNN announced Dave Briggs, formerly of NBC Sports and Fox News, would succeed him. In December 2019, Briggs signed off from co-hosting the program. The next month, in January 2020, Laura Jarrett became the new co-host. In mid-2020 the programme was reduced in length and now runs for one hour, starting at 5am ET. Notable moments On the January 9, 2012 edition of the show, Banfield and Sambolin attempted to call comedian Chuck Nice as part of the \\"Wake 'Em Up\\" segment. Instead, the show dialed the wrong number and woke up an unknown man. The episode was skewered by Jon Stewart on The Daily Show, who also mocked the format of the segment.

It is located on the west side of the island facing the open sea, beginning in the south at the car park of \\"Risgap\\" in Wenningstedt and ending in the north at Haus Kliffende on the Kampen West Heath. For centuries these striking cliffs have acted as an unmistakable recognition mark of the island for ships. Nowhere on the German and Dutch North Sea shores is there such a striking cliffed coast. About 120,000 years ago, glaciers of the Saale glaciation deposited thick, unsorted rock debris in the region of the present- day island of Sylt. As a result of rising sea levels in the post-glacial period, these formed an abrasion coastline. The rusty-red glacial till, which gives the cliffs their name, is caused by colouration arising from the oxidation of ferrous elements. Even in the 19th century, geologists suspected there was a geological connexion between Sylt and Heligoland, whose rocks have a similar coloration but are considerably older and have a different genesis. The rocks that break off the Rotes Kliff - such as flint, rhomb porphyry or Rapakivi granite - still enable an accurate determination of their origin to be made. The Rotes Kliff has always been at great risk from storm surges and erosion. Since the end of the 1970s, coastal defence measures have been taken, however, in the shape of extensive sand replenishment of the entire west beach of the island and this has proved an important protection against the loss of land. However this has also resulted in the Rotes Kliff in the municipality of Wenningstedt becoming largely invisible from the sea, because it is now hidden behind beach grass-covered sand dunes.

Top Country Albums is a chart that ranks the top-performing country music albums in the United States, published by Billboard. In 2012, 17 different albums topped the chart; placings were based on electronic point of sale data from retail outlets. In the issue of Billboard dated January 7, the band Lady Antebellum held the top spot with Own the Night, the album's sixth week in the top spot. It occupied the peak position for the first four weeks of 2012 before being displaced by Toby Keith's Clancy's Tavern and subsequently returned to number one for a further four weeks beginning in the issue dated March 3. It tied for the highest total number of weeks spent at number one during the year with Taylor Swift's Red, which reached number one in the issue of Billboard dated November 10 and remained there for the final eight weeks of the year. The album would prove to be Swift's last entry on the Top Country Albums chart, as she moved away from the country music genre with her subsequent releases. Carrie Underwood came closest to matching the two acts' time at number one, spending seven non-consecutive weeks atop the listing with Blown Away. Three acts reached number one in 2012 for the first time, beginning with Lionel Richie, who topped the chart in April with Tuskegee, only the second album of his 30-year solo career to enter the country albums listing. Throughout his career with the Commodores and as a solo artist, spanning five decades, Richie was initially associated with the soul genre and later known for pop ballads, but in 2012 he recorded Tuskegee, an album of duets with country singers, which was a success on both the pop and country charts. In late August, country-rap artist Colt Ford reached the top spot for the first time with Declaration of Independence, and two weeks later Dustin Lynch made his first appearance at number one with his self-titled debut album. Lynch, along with fellow 2012 chart-toppers Luke Bryan and Jason Aldean, was associated with the so-called bro-country style, an emerging sub-genre which incorporated influences from rock music and hip hop and often featured lyrics relating to partying, attractive young women, and pick-up trucks. Chart history Dustin Lynch topped the chart with his self-titled album. Veteran singer Lionel Richie, most associated with the soul genre and known for his ballads, had his first number-one country album in 2012. Josh Turner topped the chart with Punching Bag.

He played college football at Louisiana State University (LSU) where he won the Jacobs Blocking trophy, recognizing Southeastern Conference's (SEC) top offensive lineman, in 2014. Collins signed with the Dallas Cowboys as an undrafted free agent in 2015. Early life A native of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Collins attended Redemptorist High School, where he was named to the Louisiana 3A All- State team in each of his final three seasons. Paving the way for running back Jeremy Hill, Collins helped lead Redemptorist to a LHSAA Class 3A state quarterfinals berth in his senior year, where the team lost to Patterson which were led by running back Kenny Hilliard. After the season, Collins played in the Under Armour All-America Game and was also named All-American by Parade and USA Today. Regarded as a five-star prospect by every major recruiting source, Collins was listed as one of the premiere offensive tackle prospects in the class of 2011. Rivals.com ranked him second behind only Cyrus Kouandjio, while ESPN had him in third place, behind Kouandjio and Christian Westerman. Collins had offers from almost every major program in the country, including Auburn, Florida State, and Southern California, but committed early to Louisiana State in September 2009. College career In his true freshman year in 2011, Collins played in seven games with no starts. In a total of 46 snaps on the offensive line, he posted five knockdown blocks and was recognized as a Freshman All-American by CBSSports.com after the season. As a sophomore, Collins started all 13 games for LSU, replacing Will Blackwell at left guard, and led the team in both total snaps (836) and knockdowns (64.5). He was named SEC Offensive Lineman of the Week after playing all 84 offensive snaps at #1 Alabama, helping the Tigers to compile 22 first downs, 139 yards rushing, and 296 passing against the nation's No. 1 defense. Having played every offensive snap in LSU's last eleven games, Collins earned honorable mention All-SEC honors by the Associated Press. In his junior season, Collins was moved to left tackle, filling the void left by Chris Faulk. Quickly adjusting to his new position, he earned SEC Offensive Lineman of the Week honors after playing all but one snap in a 37‚Äì27 over Texas Christian in the season-opener. Collins went on the start twelve games at left tackle, only missing the Furman game in October. Louisiana State's offense accounted for school-record 465.9 total yards per game, which included 200.8 rushing and 256.8 passing, and a school-record 37 rushing touchdowns. Collins turned down an opportunity to enter the 2014 NFL Draft to return to LSU for his senior season. He started all 13 games at left tackle, leading the team in both offensive snaps (843) and knockdowns (88). The Tigers offense rushed for an average of 224.5 yards a game, the most by the team since averaging 256.6 in 1997. After the season, Collins was awarded the Jacobs Blocking Trophy, given annually to the top offensive lineman in the SEC as voted on by the league‚Äôs coaches, as the first LSU Tiger to win since Ciron Black in 2009. Collins was also voted First-team All-SEC by the league's coaches and the Associated Press. Both USA Today and AP named him second team All-American. Professional career Regarded as a first round pick in the 2015 NFL Draft and a likely top ten prospect, Collins started to drop when it was announced that he was scheduled to talk to the Louisiana State police days after the draft, about the shooting death of a pregnant woman with whom he previously had a relationship,La'el Collins goes undrafted, not eligible for '16 draftLimited options for La'el Collins after he goes undrafted in 2015 NFL draftControversial LSU tackle La‚Äôel Collins goes undrafted even though he was not considered a suspect in the crime.Police want to question La'el Collins following shooting death He eventually went undrafted after his agents threatened that he would sit out the season and enter the 2016 NFL Draft, if any NFL team selected him after the third round.Agent: La‚ÄôEl Collins won‚Äôt play this year if not drafted tonight On May 7, 2015, Collins signed as an undrafted free agent with the Dallas Cowboys. His entire three-year contract was guaranteed and worth $1,599,000 with a $21,000 signing bonus. After opening the season as a reserve offensive guard, he saw extensive action in the second game as part of the rotation that replaced an injured Ronald Leary and was later declared the starter for the third game. He eventually passed Leary on the depth chart and was promoted as the starter at left guard during the week 6 bye. He was declared inactive with a high left ankle sprain for the last game against the Washington Redskins. In 2016, he began the season as the starter at left guard over Leary, but suffered a torn ligament in his right big toe in the third game against the Chicago Bears and was placed on injured reserve on October 4. Dallas Cowboys Offensive Line vs Redskins 2017 Following the retirement of Doug Free, Collins moved over to right tackle and was named the starter to begin the season. On July 25, 2017, Collins signed a two-year, $15.4 million contract extension through the 2019 season. On September 3, 2019, Collins signed a five-year contract extension with the Cowboys. On September 7, 2020, Collins was placed on injured reserve.

Retrieved 2015-10-07. The Havre Residential Historic District represents Havre's economic growth and social change from 1895 to the 1940s. Located primarily at the district's northwestern edge, turn-of-the-century homes of the social and business elite are large residences built in Queen Anne/Colonial Revival and Neo-Colonial styles. Their owners‚Äô fortunes were made from providing supplies and services to soldiers at nearby Fort Assinniboine, homesteaders, and Great Northern Railway employees. As a railroad division point, Havre became home to white- collar workers who built smaller homes in the district. By 1907, the Craftsman bungalow was the preferred housing style. These smaller, one- or one-and-a- half-story dwellings reflect the security of the middle class in Montana during the first decades of the twentieth century. Havre's establishment as Hill County seat in 1912 coincided with the Progressive political movement that sought clean cities with suitable housing for all. Between 1913 and 1917, the Home Builders Investment Company‚Äîcreated by local Progressives‚Äîbuilt more than 100 homes. Post World War I depression dampened construction in the district, but late-1920s railroad expansion caused a housing boom. Homes subsequently built here during the Great Depression utilized lower-cost materials and simpler designs. Contributing properties Boone/Dalrymple House (132 3rd Street) The sunburst motif on the front gable end of this single-story, hipped-roof residence signals the builder's debt to the Queen Anne style. Havre pioneer Daniel H. Boone and his wife, Elizabeth, owned the four-square residence. Built before 1903 and perhaps as early as 1892, it is among Havre's older homes. The technologically advanced Boones installed a telephone in 1903 and indoor plumbing in 1906. Boone owned a drug store on Third Avenue, an easy three-block walk from here. The store burned in the devastating 1904 fire that destroyed over 90 percent of downtown. Boone's fortunes, like those of most Havre businessmen, rose from the ashes. By 1910, he was selling prescriptions and sundries from a brick business block that graced the same corner as his old wooden store. The home's longest-term residents were dentist Sidney Dalrymple and his wife, Alma, who purchased the property in 1929. Likely responsible for updating the exterior by enclosing and adding Craftsman-style windows to the original front porch, the Dalrymples lived here until their deaths, Sidney's in 1983 and Alma's in 1995. Carlin House There was no sign of the impending Great Depression in January 1929. Havre had spent half a million dollars on construction the year before, and the future looked bright. Among those kept busy by Havre's growth was prolific local builder Christ Fuglevand. Fuglevand, who built over fifty homes in Havre, constructed this single-story stucco residence in 1929 for an estimated $4,550. The house featured Craftsman-style detailing, including a low-pitched roof with wide overhanging eaves, exposed rafter tails, and a half-length porch with massive wood and cobblestone porch supports. Dan Carlin, a yardmaster for the Great Northern Railway, and his wife Clara were the home's first owners. The couple rented the daylight basement apartment for $60 a month to a dry goods store manager and his family. An increasingly common feature in Havre after 1929, such apartments frequently provided housing for students attending the Northern Montana School. This precursor to MSU-Billings was founded in 1929. Crosson-VanBuskirk Home (436 4th Avenue) Prominent builder Abe Crosson acquired this property in 1911. By 1916, a booster brochure proclaimed the frame Colonial Revival residence one of Havre's beautiful homes. In 1936, Great Northern Railroad conductor Ray VanBuskirk and his Irish-born wife, Marie, purchased the residence, establishing a home that has since spanned three generations. Their son, Warren, a railroad dispatcher, brought his Italian-American wife, Edith, to live here in 1948. Warren and Edith, offspring of Havre's rich ethnic population and railroading tradition, together raised five children in the home. Lou Lucke Sr. House (900 3rd Avenue) The quintessential businessman, Lou Lucke arrived in Havre in 1903, where he founded a shoe repair and later a clothing store and a dry cleaning business. He also speculated in real estate. When the homestead boom in turn boomed Havre, Lou and local contractor Cassius Taylor developed Havre's Lucke- Taylor Addition, where Lou and his wife, Harriet, lived in this 1914 Craftsman style bungalow. Designed by Havre architect Frank Bossout, who also designed Hill County Courthouse, the home cost approximately $5,000 to build. The interior features Italian marble and oak woodwork. The Luckes raised five children here, surrounded by family. Harriet's mother lived two doors down, and Lou's brother lived next door to her. When they came of age, Lucke sons Alvin, Louis, and Neal also built homes in the neighborhood on lots given them by their father. Harriet lived in this house into the 1970s, when she sold the home to a grandson and moved next door to the smaller, more manageable house originally built by her son Neal. She lived there until her death in 1981. John H. Mathews House (124 3rd St.) Distinguished by its bell-cast porch roof, scalloped shingles decorating the front dormer, and classical columns on the front porch, this wood-frame home was built during the Victorian era, sometime between 1892 and 1903. John Mathews, an agent for the Great Northern Express Company, owned the home by 1910. He and his wife, Kathryn, had eight children, only six of whom survived young childhood. The family supplemented its income by taking in boarders, a barber and two of John's coworkers. Two live-in servants helped Kathryn run the house: Mary Daniels, a forty-two-year- old divorced woman, and Paul Tayimo, a twenty-two-year-old Japanese man. Tayimo was one of over 1,500 Japanese immigrants living in Montana in 1910, most of whom originally worked for the railroads. Kathryn died in 1915, and like most widowers left with large families, John remarried. In 1920, he and Rena, his second wife, lived here with a servant and all six Mathews children, whose ages then ranged from twenty-three to ten. St. Mark's Episcopal Church (539 3rd Avenue) Havre's first Episcopal church service was held in 1900 at Fort Assinniboine, south of Havre. After the arrival of the Reverend Leonard J. Christler in 1907, regular services were conducted in town. The Reverend Christler immediately began plans for a permanent church, and groundbreaking took place the following year. Distinguished Kalispell architect Marion B. Riffo drew the blueprints for this beautiful Gothic style building. Constructed of donated granite from Helena, shipped by rail free of charge, the church was finally completed in 1918. Its elegant and distinctive features include a crenellated tower and carillon, graceful arched windows, and stained glass. A. D. Smith House (202 Third Street) Alexander ‚ÄúNosey‚Äù D. Smith came to Havre as a Great Northern Railroad conductor when the first trains came through town in the mid-1890s. He purchased two lots for $5 in 1897 and built this late Victorian Folk style home in 1902. Multi-light windows and the steeply pitched roof with rolled edges are reminiscent of an English cottage while Craftsman style elements include the tapered front columns. Inside, oak stair treads become pine as the stairway turns the corner. This may seem an expression of thrift, but the upstairs fixtures are silver. Smith, noted for his own beautifully kept yard, served several terms as street commissioner, transforming Havre's streets from irregular, unsightly lanes into boulevards. He also installed both styles of the town's first streetlights. Smith's wife, Jennie, gave voice lessons and the couple had one son, Harry. Smith died in 1915. In 1926, Jennie sold the house to Dr. Arthur Husser and his wife, Rae. Dr. Husser's surgical practice was on First Street and his wife was a nurse at the Havre Clinic.

He then undertook a complete overhaul of the playing staff for the start of the new season. After a poor start to the 2016-2017 season, with only one win in eight games, The Hawks replaced Asensio with former Eastleigh manager Richard Hill.

NBSS offers nine full-time programs, including bookbinding, cabinet and furniture making, carpentry, jewelry making and repair, locksmithing and security technology, basic piano technology, advanced piano technology, preservation carpentry, and violin making and repair, as well as a range of short courses and continuing education opportunities. Housed for more than 130 years at 39 North Bennet Street, near the Old North Church in Boston's North End, the School completed renovations on the former Police Station One and former City of Boston Printing Plant in September 2013. The subsequent move to the fully renovated 65,000 sq. ft. facility at 150 North Street brought all of their programs under one roof. Founded in 1879 as the North End Industrial Home by volunteers from the Associated Charities as a settlement house serving the needs of recent immigrants, North Bennet Street Industrial School was officially incorporated in 1885. The vocational and preparatory programs underwent changes throughout the nineteenth and twentieth century and the school assumed its present name and mission in 1981. History The Immigrant Experience The North End Industrial Home was originally established at 39 North Bennet Street in 1879 by fifty volunteers from an organization known as the Associated CharitiesHenry & Williams, 1985, p. 9 as a settlement house serving the needs of recent immigrants in Boston's North End. In the late nineteenth century, the North End was among the most densely populated areas in the United States.Woods, 1902, p. 40 The low-rent tenements near the docks had been drawing immigrants for generations. Driven by a philanthropic philosophy of \\"elevation by contact\\",Woods, 1923, p. 7 the Associated Charities volunteers sought to improve the circumstances of the poor through visitation and by way of example. The volunteers taught sewing and laundry classes to those they called the \\"worthy poor\\": widows, single women, and women supporting their husbands.Lazerson, 1971, p. 107 Class participants received instruction and wages for piece work.Henry & Williams, 1985, p. 10 Pauline Agassiz Shaw joined the ranks of the volunteers in 1880. She founded a kindergarten and nursery school in the building and donated the money needed to lease the building for five years.Henry & Williams, 1985, p. 13 The North End Industrial Home grew as a school for children and their mothers, as well as a training ground for prospective teachers.Henry & Williams, p. 13 Recreation rooms, a lending library, and social clubs for working adults were also housed in the building. North Bennet Street Industrial School (NBSIS) was founded in 1881 and formally incorporated in 1885, following the purchase of the building at 39 North Bennet Street. Founded to help immigrants transition to American life, NBSIS pioneered a holistic approach to community service a century before the term became popular.Henry & Williams, 1985, p. 14 NBSIS offered job skill training classes to men and unmarried women, mothers were offered courses in home economics, and various social clubs and summer trips to the country were incorporated into the program.Henry & Williams, 1985, p. 15 The school's 1885 charter defined NBSIS as \\"an institution for training in industrial occupations persons of all ages, and for other educational and charitable work, and for furnishing opportunities for instruction and amusement to them, including libraries, reading rooms and whatever else may contribute to their physical and moral well being\\".North Bennet Street Industrial School Charter (1885). NBSIS Papers, Series IIAviii, folder 2. Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Boston, MA. By 1891, manual training was a required part of public school education.NBSIS Annual Report (1891), p. 3. NBSIS Papers, Series I, folder 2. Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Boston, MA. NBSIS administered woodworking classes for boys and cooking classes for girls until 1913, when the public school system assumed responsibility for pre-vocational training.Henry & Williams, 1985, p. 18 Public schools continued to rent equipment and space at North Bennet Street until 1937.Letter from the School Committee of the City of Boston to NBSIS (1937). NBSIS Papers, Series IIAvii, folder 4. Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Boston, MA. Printing, taught by Louis Hull, was offered as one of the first courses offered to pre- vocational students.Henry & Williams, 1985, p. 18 Vocational training In 1889, Mrs. Shaw brought Carl Fullen and Lars Eriksson, along with other Sloyd teachers, to NBSIS. Originating in Sweden, the Sloyd method of instruction involved using craft projects to facilitate education, aiming to \\"arouse a desire and pleasure in work; to accustom students to independence; to instill virtues of exactness, order and accuracy: and to train the attention\\".NBSIS Annual Report (1890). NBSIS Papers, Series IIBi, folder 138. Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Boston, MA. Students were given progressively more difficult projects that built on each other and they were expected to work on them as independently as possible.Larsson, 1907 Gustaf Larsson became head of the Sloyd program in 1891 and published a quarterly periodical on the principles of instruction. The school instituted training for teachers in the Sloyd methodology, and Larsson estimated that over three hundred teachers had graduated from the Sloyd training class by 1903.NBSIS Annual Report (1903). NBSIS Papers, Series I, folder 4. Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Boston, MA. The Sloyd project-based mode of teaching is still the basis of craft curriculums at North Bennet Street School.\\"North Bennet Street School: About\\". http://www.nbss.edu/about/index.aspx The Boston Public Library established a branch at North Bennet Street Industrial School in 1899, with Edith Guerrier serving as librarian. Guerrier started evening discussion groups that, with the help of Edith Brown, developed into the Saturday Evening Girls Club.Henry & Williams, 1985, p. 21 Alvin E. Dodd was hired as the first professional administrator of the school in 1907.Henry & Williams, 1985, p. 25 Dodd divided the school into several departments: plastic and graphic arts, mechanical arts, household arts, library, gymnasium, clubs, social service house, and buildings and administration. Each department was assigned a head and board members oversaw departments through committees. Certificates were awarded to individuals who completed prevocational and evening classes.Henry & Williams, 1985, p. 26. A formal partnership developed between the North Bennet Street Industrial School and the Boston Trade School for the education of young women.NBSIS Annual Report (1912). NBSIS Papers, Series I, folder 9. Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Boston, MA. By 1911, 28 salaried teachers and over fifty volunteers participated in teaching eleven hundred enrolled students. In 1915, Dodd left the school to join the National Society for the Promotion of Industrial Education as its business manager, leaving George C. Greener, the former ceramics instructor, as the new director of the school.Henry & Williams, 1985, p. 31 Drawing inspiration from John Ruskin and William Morris, two leaders of the Arts and Crafts Movement, Greener introduced weaving and courses in making light fixtures to the school. Greener provided the school with a new motto: \\"Hand and mind lead to life\\". The school's finances were precarious, and the copies of early American lighting fixtures produced by the students were sold to fund school programs.NBSIS Papers, Series IIBiii, folder 29. Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Boston, MA. Similarly, the homespun, vegetable-dyed cloth produced by the weaving program was marketed through the Industrial Arts shop on Charles Street at the foot of Beacon Hill to provide income to both students and the school.NBSIS News Bulletin (1923). NBSIS Papers, Series IIAviii, folder 50. Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Boston, MA. The homespun cloth department lasted until 1932.Henry & Williams, 1985, p. 35 During this time, NBSIS, in cooperation with the City of Boston, developed a power machine operating class that paid wages to girls as they studied, combining academic work in the morning and vocational work in the afternoon. Local businesses, such as Filene‚Äôs and Jordan Marsh, marketed aprons, curtains, shirts, lingerie and hospital garb produced by students in the program. The course was terminated in the 1950s. Following World War I, Greener introduced a number of vocational classes for veterans, including watch repair, cabinet making, carpentry, printing, and jewelry engraving.Henry & Williams, 1985, p. 37 Between 1946 and 1947, Greener introduced the trade courses that continue to be the basis for the school: cabinet and furniture making, jewelry making and engraving, carpentry, and piano tuning.Henry & Williams, 1985, p. 53 Watch repair was also offered at this time. Greener retired in 1954 and Ernest Jacoby, a Harvard graduate, was hired as the new director. As the demographics of the North End and the needs of the nation shifted NBSIS when from training recent immigrants to training returning World War II veterans and disabled students referred by the Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission.NBSIS New Bulletin (1960). NBSIS Papers, Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Boston, MA. Jacoby retired in 1976 and Thomas B. Williams served as the school's director through the 1980s.Henry & Williams, 1985, p. 63. Recent history: Evolving mission With middle-income professionals replacing immigrant populations in the North End, and other publicly funded organizations in place to serve the poor, NBSIS became known primarily as a center for training in fine crafts.Henry & Williams, 1985, p. 61 In the 1980s, North Bennet Street Industrial School began transferring responsibilities for the operation of social service programs to the North End Union, while continuing administrative and financial support. The board voted to drop \\"Industrial\\" from the school‚Äôs name and rewrote the school's articles of organization so that the objective was to \\"train adults, who have completed a minimum of secondary level education, in trades that require primarily manual skills and individualized work\\".North Bennet Street School files, 1981; North Bennet Street School, Boston, MA. The program offerings in carpentry, cabinet and furniture making, locksmithing, jewelry making and repair, and piano technology were expanded in the mid-1980s with courses in bookbinding, violin making, and preservation carpentry. These programs were specifically selected because bench skill programs in these fields were either lacking or underrepresented in the United States. Accreditation from the National Association of Trade and Technical Schools (NATTS) was awarded to the North Bennet Street School in 1982, and the United States Department of Education classified the school as a post-secondary institution.Henry & Williams, 1985, p. 63 Students from around the world come to North Bennet Street School to immerse themselves on the intensive training of a fine craft or trade. Many more take advantage of the shorter workshop courses also offered at the school. Current programs Bookbinding: In this two-year program, students learn fundamental hand-bookbinding techniques while producing a variety of binding structures in cloth, paper, leather, and vellum. Hands-on book repair and conservation techniques are taught, along with tool use and modification, edition binding techniques, and protective enclosures. The second year is focused primarily on fine leather bindings and more advanced finishing and conservation procedures. Graduates enter the field as bookbinders in custom binderies and university or institutional conservation labs or as self- employed bookbinders and book artists. Cabinet & Furniture Making: Through bench exercises and building projects, students learn techniques using hand and power tools and gain an understanding of the methods and construction strategies used to create high-quality custom pieces. By drawing from the rich tradition of 18th and early 19th century American furniture, the program aims to inform and enhance any design aspirations by providing a solid foundation in fine furniture making. Graduates enter fields such as cabinet and furniture making, architectural millwork and furniture repair and restoration. This is a two-year program. Carpentry: In this one-year program, students learn to construct and renovate residential and commercial wood-framed buildings through skilled use of tools and machines and knowledge of construction principles and procedures, including current and emerging industry standards and building practices. The small class size ensures ample one-to-one instruction and supervision from a master carpenter. Students experience the importance of working as a team on building sites and graduate ready to work safely, accurately and efficiently to satisfy clients‚Äô needs. Preservation Carpentry:Through lectures, demonstrations, projects and site work, students in this two-year program develop a thorough grounding in pre-20th century New England house construction and are exposed to a broad range of construction methods, including stabilizing endangered buildings, preserving and uncovering architectural details and documenting and recreating historic design elements. Students graduate with the skills needed to work with contractors and institutions that specialize in preservation and conservation work, including historic millwork and interior finish carpentry for traditional buildings. Jewelry Making & Repair: Through a series of hands-on projects, each requiring new skills and building on previous learning, students in this two-year course develop proficiency using a wide range of tools and working with precious metals and stones. Techniques include polishing, soldering, engraving, metal fabrication, laser welding, stone-setting and wax model-making. Graduates have the fundamental knowledge and technical skills of jewelry making and repair needed to enter the workforce as professional makers of fine jewelry. Locksmithing and Security Technology: This nine-month program combines classroom theory, lectures and demonstrations with hands-on bench work along with security hardware installation and fieldwork experience. Students learn to service, repair and install all types of residential and commercial locking devices, set up master-key systems, install locks, service safes, basic automotive lock services and gain familiarity with electronic and mechanical access control systems. The program includes ample time for practice, providing students the experience required to enter the field as qualified security professionals. Basic Piano Technology and Advanced Piano Technology: The basic piano technology program covers instruction in all phases of aural piano tuning including the concepts upon which equal temperament is founded. Students tune, regulate, and repair the actions of both upright and grand pianos and learn the skills required to become members of the Piano Technicians Guild as Registered Piano Technicians. The advanced piano technology program focuses on comprehensive piano services including advanced tuning and regulation practice, grand piano repair and rebuilding, and the resolution of service problems that occur in the field. Each program lasts nine months. Violin Making and Repair: In this three-year program, students build a solid foundation in instrument making and an introduction to the art and science of stringed instrument restoration. Over the course of the three- year program, students build five violins, a viola and a bowed string instrument of the student‚Äôs choosing. The program teaches the fundamental hand skills required for the construction and finishing as well as the set-up and repair of stringed instruments in accordance with the highest standards of the craft and the needs of expert musicians.

Anthony was in charge of the conchology (now malacology) department of Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology for over a decade. Biography His school education was slight, and was entirely discontinued when he became 12 years of age. Business pursuits then occupied his attention. He probably first became a clerk for a mercantile concern. Throughout his life, his handwriting was in the classic clerk's or copperplate style. In 1832, he married Anna Whiting Rhodes of Cincinnati, and in 1835 the family moved to Cincinnati, where fossil mollusks were plentiful and accessible. He and his wife had nine children. They remained in Cincinnati for 35 years, where John Gould actively engaged in commercial occupations ‚Äî working in a firm making silver plate, as an independent account, as a partner in a bookselling and publishing firm. The year they arrived in Cincinnati, he joined the Western Academy of Natural Sciences, a group of serious amateurs. His interest in natural history developed. His publications attracted the attention of Louis Agassiz, and in 1863 he was asked to take charge of the conchological department of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, where he remained until his death. He accompanied Agassiz on the Thayer Expedition to Brazil in 1865. Anthony was recognized as an authority on the American land and freshwater mollusca. He spent most of his time at Harvard sorting and mounting specimens.

Featuring a rocky coastline, its mouth is formed at Tongue Bay. The community of Tongue is situated on the Kyle's eastern shore and the loch is crossed by the Kyle of Tongue Bridge and Causeway. The sea loch and surrounding countryside is designated as the Kyle of Tongue National Scenic Area, one of the forty such areas in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection from inappropriate development. The designated area covers 24,488 ha in total, of which 21,093 ha is on land, with a further 3396 ha being marine (i.e. below low tide level), and takes in the nearby mountains of Ben Hope and Ben Loyal as well as several small islands and the coastline as far east as Bettyhill. History Castle Varrich, overlooking the Kyle. According to the Origines Parochiales Scotiae, Castle Varrich, an old square tower on a hill on the east side of the Kyle, was the residence of Karl Hundason, who made an effort to conquer Scotland on the death of Malcolm II. There are three brochs: on the Kyle's east side opposite Melness; at the head of the Kyle; and at Dunbuie, a hill on the west side of the Kyle. In 1746, a naval engagement occurred at the Kyle involving Bonnie Prince Charlie's Jacobite rebellion. The Jacobite ship Le Prince Charles, commanded by Captain Richard Talbot, was bringing a large amount of French gold to aid the Jacobite cause. It was chased by a British squadron and one of the Royal Navy frigates eventually caught up with it in the Kyle of Tongue, on 25 February 1746. A fierce five- hour battle took place: the Jacobite ship fought bravely, but in the end was defeated. The failure of the gold to reach the Prince's army was one of the main factors which led to the Battle of Culloden.C. Duffy, The 45 (2003), pp. 461‚Äì464. Geography Kyle of Tongue is situated east of Loch Eriboll. Its western entrance is between Cnoc Glass and Roan Island; the eastern entrance is between Rosin Island and Neave Island. From Roan Island, the Kyle trends in a south and southwest direction for to Kinloch. A large portion of it is sandy, with a narrow bar-encumbered channel running through it. The depths range from approximately 18 fathoms west of Roan Island to 5 fathoms in the area above where the shallows begin. There is no channel into the Kyle of Tongue along the western shore. Derry (or Loch an Dithreibh) is a lake which empties into the head of the Kyle of Tongue. Strathtongue, an long stream, runs to the Kyle. Flora and fauna The surrounding hills are characterized by meadows, grasses, and heath. There is moorland between the Kyle and Loch Eriboll. Much of the area is protected as part of the Natura 2000 network, forming part of the Caithness and Sutherland Peatlands, which are protected as both a Special Protection Area and a Special Area of Conservation. Water fauna within the Kyle include salmon and sea trout, whilst whales and otters can be found at the mouth of the loch. Bird species living in the area include barn swallows, black-headed gulls, ravens, redshanks, wood pigeons, herring gulls, collared doves, curlews, oystercatchers, golden plovers, great black-backed gulls, cormorants, grey herons, greylag geese, house martins, house sparrows, meadow pipits, common gulls, red-throated divers, and rock pigeons. Additionally, a number of raptor species can be found, including golden eagles, hen harriers, merlins and short-eared owls. Land ownership Much of the land on the western and southern sides of the Kyle, including the mountains of Ben Hope and Ben Loyal and the former hunting lodge of Kinloch Lodge, belongs to Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen. The land on the eastern shore forms part of the extensive estates of the Countess of Sutherland, currently Elizabeth Sutherland, 24th Countess of Sutherland.

Shankar. A remake of the 1957 Hindi film Do Aankhen Barah Haath, it stars M. G. Ramachandran and Latha. The film revolves around a prison warden (Ramachandran) who takes six paroled convicts (M. N. Nambiar, V. K. Ramasamy, Thengai Srinivasan, R. S. Manohar, P. S. Veerappa and Gundumani) to work on a dilapidated country farm in an attempt to rehabilitate them. The film was released on 31 October 1975 and ran for over 100 days in theatres, but was not as successful as the original Hindi film.  Plot  Rajan is a prison warden. He takes six paroled convicts ‚Äì Bhaiyaravan (who stabbed a businessman), Mayandi (an ex-barber who knifed a customer), Mounkannu (who stabbed a man and his daughter), Sangili (who drowned his wife), David (who killed a policeman) and Kalayr (who killed his family) ‚Äì and makes them work hard with him on a dilapidated country farm, with the intention of rehabilitating them through hard work and kindly guidance. He is, however, given an ultimatum: he will be arrested if even one of the convicts attempts to escape. The group comes across Saroja, an itinerant seller who they get attracted to, but she only gets close to Rajan, after he saves her from a bunch of goons. As Saroja is homeless, the six convicts plead with Rajan to let the girl stay with them and he subsequently agrees. When Sangili coincidentally runs into his long-lost family, he tearfully reunites with them. But they appear homeless, so Rajan allows them also to stay with him and the other convicts. This angers the other convicts who feel that Rajan did not give them freedom, compelling them to try killing him to escape. Mayandi agrees to give Rajan a shave, plotting to cut his neck, and Rajan remains unaware of the threat to his life. Mayandi sees Rajan's magical eyes and gets hypnotised, forcing him to abort the idea of murder. The convicts who were attempting escape during this time see a statue of C. N. Annadurai and because they see Rajan's spirit in it, they get hypnotised and return. The escape attempt is seen by the other policemen around, leading to Rajan's stay in jail for one day. However, when they hear that the convicts have returned, Rajan is released and returns to duty. The convicts gradually turn into good people and become attached to Rajan, who dreams of marrying Saroja, in his mother's presence. One night, the convicts are invited to a bar by a corrupt businessman and Rajan is unaware of this. They return drunk and almost attack Rajan and Saroja. Rajan is not pleased with their status and commands them to kill him if that is what they want. Hypnotism and conscience again strike the convicts, causing them to drop their weapons. The next morning, the convicts fall at Rajan's feet and explain that the corrupt businessman forced them to drink; they earn the forgiveness of both Rajan and Saroja. Later, the corrupt businessman orders that Rajan and his convicts surrender, or else their plantation and home will be destroyed. Rajan refuses, so the businessman sends his thugs and elephants to destroy everything in sight. However, Rajan and his men vigorously battle all the thugs and emerge victorious, while the local police capture the corrupt businessman and arrest him. Rajan, having been praised for transforming the six convicts into reformed people, frees them and tearfully sees them off.  Cast  *M. G. Ramachandran as Rajan *Latha as Saroja *M. N.

Shankar, and produced by S. V. S. Manian and Vidwan Ve. Lakshmanan under the banner Udhayam Productions. The screenplay was written by a team consisting of Manian, Lakshmanan, Thaamarai Manaalan, and Na. Pandurangan. Cinematography was handled by T. V. Rajaram. Unlike the original, this did not feature the male lead being killed, a measure which was taken after Ramachandran's character in an earlier film Paasam (1962) died and caused negative fan reactions, that resulted in the film's failure. It also featured a love interest for the male lead, unlike the original. P. S. Veerappa, M. N. Nambiar and R. S. Manohar, who were regular villains in Ramachandran's films, played three of the six convicts. The other three were played by comedians Thengai Srinivasan, V. K. Ramasamy and stunt actor Gundumani. Much of the film was shot at Karnataka.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack of the film has been composed by K. V. Mahadevan.  Release and reception  Pallandu Vazhga was released on 31 October 1975. Ananda Vikatan stated, \\"‡Æé‡ÆÆ‡Øç.‡Æú‡Æø.‡ÆÜ‡Æ∞‡Øç. ‡Æ∞‡Æö‡Æø‡Æï‡Æ∞‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ≥‡ØÅ‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡ØÅ ‡ÆÆ‡Æü‡Øç‡Æü‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æ≤, ‡Æé‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æ≤‡Øã‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Øá ‡Æ™‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æ≤‡Ææ‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æü‡ØÅ ‡Æµ‡Ææ‡Æ¥‡Øç‡Æï ‡Æì‡Æ∞‡Øç ‡Æá‡Æ©‡Æø‡ÆØ ‡Æö‡Æø‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ∞‡ÆÆ‡Øç\\" (Pallandu Vazhga is a film not only for MGR fans, but a good film for everyone). The film ran for over 100 days in theatres, but did not achieve the same success as the 1957 original. According to critic V. A. K. Ranga Rao, the film broke even because of Ramachandran's \\"power over the box-office\\".

He is a research associate of several museums. Mol's primary focus is on mammals of the Quaternary period, including mammoths and extinct rhinoceros species. Biography Early life and education Dick Mol was born in Winterswijk, Gelderland (The Netherlands), in 1955, as one of nine children, Mol could not afford to attend higher education after high school, and so he joined customs service in 1974. As the Netherlands implemented the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), Dick Mol was trained to be a CITES specialist, spending much time on the job studying bones, eventually accumulating ample knowledge to compensate for an academic career. Career Dick has catalogued fossil remains dredged from the bottom of the North Sea, and published over fifty papers on his finds. Since 1990, he has been associated with The Mammoth Site, Hot Springs, South Dakota, collaborating with Larry Agenbroad on four papers dealing with field and laboratory research in paleontology, geology and paleoecology. In 1999, Dick contributed his expertise to the project for excavating the frozen remains of the Jarkov Mammoth led by Bernard Buigues, which was chronicled in the Discovery Channel's second highest-rated documentary ‚ÄúRaising the Mammoth\\". Dick returned to Siberia several times, continuing the search and study of Pleistocene remains on the Taimyr Peninsula using an ice cave in Khatanga, Russia. He was also part of the team that recovered the Yukagir mammoth in Yakutia, which has been on display at Expo 2005 in Aichi Japan (Mol et al. 2006c). He is coordinator of the Cerpolex/Mammuthus program, ‚ÄúWho or What Killed the Mammoths‚Äù. His goal is to learn more about all of the Pleistocene fauna that lived on the Pleistocene Mammoth steppe, which included the Taimyr Peninsula, but also the North Sea, the low countries and the UK. Throughout his career, Mol has cataloged numerous fossil remains dredged from the bottom of the North Sea. The last years he has been co-operating with Professor Evangelia Tsoukala in Greece, excavating mastodons in Greek Macedonia. With Fr√©d√©ric Lacombat he is studying the extinct Proboscidea of the Haute-Loire, Auvergne, France.

Since November 2019 it is published daily Tuesday through Sunday. Based in Champaign, Illinois, the paper is owned, along with sister radio stations WDWS, WKIO and WHMS, by Community Media Group, Inc., which purchased it in November 2019 after the paper filed for bankruptcy.  History  The paper traces its history to the Urbana Union, founded in 1852. By the turn of the century, it had moved to Champaign and become the Champaign Daily News. In 1919, David W. Stevick, owner and publisher of the Daily News, bought the Champaign Daily Gazette and merged them into the current paper. He died in 1935 and passed it to his widow, Helen M. Stevick. Helen died in 1967 and was succeeded by her daughter, Marajen Stevick Chinigo, who ran the paper until her death in 2002. In 1979, the paper's longtime rival, the Champaign-Urbana Courier, ceased publication. This left Champaign with only one daily newspaper for the first time. From its founding until June 2009, the News-Gazette published its main edition in the afternoon. The paper was well known in the area as being one of the only afternoon papers left. Beginning in the late 1990s, the paper printed an edition specifically geared towards Champaign and Urbana that was published in the morning. Due to the decreasing revenue from print advertising, the News-Gazette switched to morning publication only on June 1, 2009. Since 1937, it has been co-owned with the area's oldest commercial radio station, WDWS. An FM sister was added in 1949; it is now WHMS. Another rock station, WUIL (now WKIO), was purchased in May 2010. The News-Gazette has a circulation ranging from 22,000‚Äì30,000 (depending on the day of the week). The News-Gazette is well-known and acclaimed for its sports section. It has consistently ranked among the top sports sections among small markets in the country. Loren Tate, a Champaign sports writer and broadcaster, has been covering the Illinois Fighting Illini for the News-Gazette and WDWS since 1965. The News-Gazette has consistently been an Illinois Press Association award-winning newspaper for editorial and advertising excellence. Since 2008, the News-Gazette's advertising department has been awarded the Illinois Press Association's Annual James S. Copley Memorial Sweepstakes Award for Daily Newspaper Advertising Excellence 6 times. This is considered to be the top honor available and is awarded for overall excellence in advertising. The News-Gazette often prints special reports or series from Associated Press writers about the state or national government. The newspaper's website () is the most viewed commercial website in East Central Illinois. It is viewed by around 30,000‚Äì35,000 unique visitors a day, and receives 3.5 million page views per month. On April 11, 2017, the News-Gazette announced plans to phase out its local printing and packaging operations by mid-summer 2017. The Journal Star in Peoria will provide all printing and packaging services, and the move will eliminate approximately 35 full- and part-time positions. News- Gazette Media filed for bankruptcy on August 30, 2019, and announced the purchase of the company's assets by Community Media Group, Inc., which owns several community newspapers throughout the country. The sale was finalized on November 10, 2019, at which point the News-Gazette ceased publishing its Monday print edition and ceased home delivery outside Champaign-Urbana.

He reached many important goals in the field of diplomacy and teaching during his lifetime. He founded the prestigious Colegio Roscio and translated works like Reasoned, historical and dogmatic Catechism of Abbe Th√©riou and Introduction to the method to study the Latin language of Jean-Louis Burnouf into Spanish. In 1853, with the publication of his Manual of Urbanity and Good Manners, he entered history with the nickname of \\"Manual of Carre√±o\\", a sesquicentennial book that teaches and trains the individual in the management of decency, essential to the education of tens of generations, and was reissued numerous times. He served as foreign minister and Minister of Finance of Venezuela. After his resignation from the latter post due to the Federal War, he left the country, living in New York and then in Paris, where he died. Biography Early years He was born in Caracas, the son of a musician Cayetano Carre√±o Rodr√≠guez (choirmaster of the Cathedral of Caracas) and Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s Mu√±oz. At home, he and his brothers got a solid cultural and musical training, which would allow them to stand out as excellent performers and composers. Hs showed great talent for pedagogy, leading him to found the Roscio College on September 1, 1841, which eventually came to enjoy great fame in Caracas. He was the nephew of Simon Narciso Rodriguez Carre√±o, better known as Sim√≥n Rodr√≠guez, tutor and mentor of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. Personal life He was the father of Teresa Carre√±o, an acclaimed pianist and composer, who himself trained in musical arts in addition to propelling his career abroad. He was married to Clorinda Garc√≠a de Sena y Rodr√≠guez del Toro. Maturity In 1853, he serialized the Manual of Urbanity and Good Manners,Manuel Antonio Carre√±o. Manual de Urbanidad y buenas maneras para j√≥venes de ambos sexos (PDF), lafuentedelconocimiento.weebly.com; accessed August 3, 2017. for which he received great recognition and fame. This manual had a great repercussion on a global level, to the point that it was approved to be taught in elementary schools in Spain. So this 1853 work was used as a text since the beginning, not only in Spain but in other Spanish-speaking countries as well. The Royal Order (of Spain), however, established that the new editions of this work should delete the references to the country for which they were written (Venezuela). The importance of this book is based on the fact that it was directed towards children of both sexes in a time where education was almost exclusively for boys and the more powerful social classes. The book elaborates on the moral and religious standards that were so important in the 19th century, that, evidently, had already been lost due to the long period of time that had passed. In referring to courtesy and good manners, one has to remember that, even though it may appear an exaggeration, this book exercised an enormous influence in educated Venezuelan society for many generations and even today, some of these standards are easily identifiable to foreigners who have recently arrived to the country, all from a European origin. In late 1853, his daughter Mar√≠a Teresa was born and since then, Manuel Antonio Carre√±o pursued his musical education. For this he wrote 500 piano exercises, which covered teaching and learning all the technical aspects of the instrument. On March 14, 1855, the National Congress gave a special recommendation for the use of the Manual of Urbanity and Good Customs. As part of his work as an educator, he translated the book in collaboration with Dr. Manuel Mar√≠a Urbanski, Catechism of Abbe Th√©riou and Introduction to the method to study the Latin language by Burnouf. He served as Minister of Foreign Relations (May‚ÄìAugust 1861) and Minister of Finance (1861). Emigration to France Because of the political instability that existed in Venezuela as a result of the Federal War, he decided to leave his post and go abroad in search of better conditions for his daughter's artistic development. In this regard, on July 23, 1862, they departed together for New York, where they lived for a few years before departing for Paris. In Paris, where he died Carre√±o was a piano professor.

Waren Tay and Bernard Sachs, two physicians of the late 19th century described the progression of the disease precisely and provided differential diagnostic criteria to distinguish it from other neurological disorders with similar symptoms. Both Tay and Sachs reported their first cases among Jewish families. Tay reported his observations in 1881 in the first volume of the proceedings of the British Ophthalmological Society, of which he was a founding member. By 1884, he had seen three cases in a single family. Years later, Bernard Sachs, an American neurologist, reported similar findings when he reported a case of \\"arrested cerebral development\\" to members of the New York Neurological Society. Sachs, who recognized that the disease had a familial basis, proposed that the disease should be called amaurotic familial idiocy. However, its genetic basis was still poorly understood. Although Gregor Mendel had published his article on the genetics of peas in 1865, Mendel's paper was largely forgotten for more than a generation, not rediscovered by other scientists until 1899. Thus, the Mendelian model for explaining Tay‚ÄìSachs was unavailable to scientists and medical practitioners of the time. The first edition of the Jewish Encyclopedia, published in 12 volumes between 1901 and 1906, described what was then known about the disease: > It is a curious fact that amaurotic family idiocy, a rare and fatal disease > of children, occurs mostly among Jews. The largest number of cases has been > observed in the United States‚Äîover thirty in number. It was at first thought > that this was an exclusively Jewish disease, because most of the cases at > first reported were between Russian and Polish Jews; but recently there have > been reported cases occurring in non-Jewish children. The chief > characteristics of the disease are progressive mental and physical > enfeeblement; weakness and paralysis of all the extremities; and marasmus, > associated with symmetrical changes in the macula lutea. On investigation of > the reported cases, they found that neither consanguinity nor syphilitic, > alcoholic, or nervous antecedents in the family history are factors in the > etiology of the disease. No preventive measures have as yet been discovered, > and no treatment has been of benefit, all the cases having terminated > fatally.  Eugenics era  Logo from the Second International Eugenics Conference held in 1921 Three international eugenics conferences, gatherings that attracted scientists and medical practitioners, were held between 1912 and 1932. These conferences are often regarded as the high water mark of the Eugenics movement, which claimed a scientific basis for racial theories. According to sociologist Shelley Reuter, early medical writing about Tay‚ÄìSachs disease often treated Tay‚ÄìSachs disease as an exclusively Jewish disease and in the process contributed to a characterization of Jews as a racial group. This treatment mirrored the view of genetic disease in society as a whole, in a time when the Eugenics movement was ascendant. When the disease was reported in non-Jewish patients, physicians were skeptical. Often, they questioned the diagnosis, or they speculated that the patient must have \\"Jewish blood.\\" Sachs, who was Jewish, at first questioned how the disease could be confined to Jews. But by 1903 he was convinced: \\"Why children of one race should be affected so much more often than those of others, when the allied conditions show no such preference, remains as great a puzzle as ever.\\" Among physicians, the characterization of humanity according to race was taken for granted. The question of whether Jews constitute a \\"pure race\\" or a \\"mixed race\\" was under debate, and Tay‚ÄìSachs disease was seen as evidence of a Jewish racial type, which was believed to have a predilection for neurological disorders. Even the Jewish Encyclopedia reflected such a characterization of Tay‚ÄìSachs disease: > In the present state of knowledge of the etiology of idiocy and imbecility > in general the only cause of their frequency among Jews that may be > considered is the neurotic taint of the race. Children descending from a > neurotic ancestry have nervous systems which are very unstable, and they are > often incapable of tiding safely over the crises attending growth and > development. They are often idiots or imbeciles. In the United States, the World War I era was a period of rising nativism, of hostility to immigrants. Jewish immigration to the United States peaked in the period 1880‚Äì1924, with most of the immigrants arriving from Russia and countries in Eastern Europe. Opponents of immigration often questioned whether immigrants from southern and eastern Europe, such as Italians and Jews, could be assimilated into American society. Reports of Tay‚ÄìSachs disease contributed to a perception among nativists that Jews were an inferior race. Reuter writes, \\"The fact that Jewish immigrants continued to display their nervous tendencies in America where they were free from persecution was seen as proof of their biological inferiority and raised concerns about the degree to which they were being permitted free entry into the US.\\"  Scientific methodology  DNA microarray (2008) allows for assay of approximately 500,000 polymorphisms in a single genome. Eugenic and racial theories fell out of favor among scientists with the rise of Fascism and Nazism in Europe. After World War II, eugenics became associated with Nazi abuses, such as enforced racial hygiene, human experimentation, and the extermination of undesired population groups. At the same time that interest in racial theories was waning, progress in biochemistry, molecular biology, and genetics was paving the way for a scientific reappraisal and understanding of Tay‚ÄìSachs disease. With the rediscovery of Mendel's work after 1900, scientists began to identify human genetic diseases that could be explained by Mendelian patterns. By the 1930s, hundreds of cases of Tay‚ÄìSachs disease had been reported in medical literature. David Slome, a researcher in the Department of Social Biology at the University of London, summarizing the knowledge of the time, concluded that Tay‚ÄìSachs disease was caused by a single genetic defect, and that it followed an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Slome also concluded that Tay‚ÄìSachs was not exclusively a Jewish phenomenon. \\"Although initially regarded as being limited to the Hebrew race, undoubtedly authentic cases of the disease have been reported in Gentile families. The author has found records of eighteen such cases in the literature examined.\\" Biochemistry as a distinct scientific field is often dated to the discovery of enzymes in 1897, to roughly the same time frame as the rediscovery of Mendel's work. However, it was not until the 1940s that the concept of metabolic pathway was understood and accepted. The one gene one enzyme model of George Beadle and Edward Tatum integrated biochemistry with molecular genetics. In the new model, it was also recognized that genes and their protein products perform regulatory functions in the cell, controlling enzyme activity in metabolic pathways. This new understanding of metabolic processes paved the way for advances in both biochemistry and genetics that would lead to testing for genetic disease. Biochemists of this era were able to identify and characterize mutations indirectly through protein sequencing, but lacked the molecular techniques to observe mutations directly. By the early 1960s, this new partnership of biochemistry and Mendelian genetics had achieved a success, the detection of phenylketonuria, an autosomal recessive genetic disorder also. Phenylketonuria is a common metabolic disease in which the failure of an essential liver enzyme, needed to break down a byproduct of digestion of certain proteins, leads to mental retardation and other neurological problems. Success with phenylketonuria was brought about through mass post-natal screening of newborn infants, together with dietary modification, a form of substrate reduction therapy. Although there is no cure for phenylketonuria, early detection made it possible for patients to avoid its harmful effects and live essentially normal lives. By the late 1960s, post-natal screening for phenylketonuria was mandated in the United States and most industrial nations. Although carrier screening was not yet available, phenylketonuria was a spectacular success for public health, the first successful application of mass screening in medical genetics. In 1969, John S. O'Brien demonstrated that Tay‚ÄìSachs disease was caused by a defect in a crucial enzyme. He also proved that Tay‚ÄìSachs disease patients could be diagnosed by enzyme assay of hexosaminidase A. Further development of enzyme assay testing demonstrated that levels of both hexosaminidases A and B could be measured in patients and carriers, allowing reliable detection of heterozygotes. During the early 1970s, researchers developed protocols for newborn testing, carrier screening, and pre-natal diagnosis. By the end of the 1970s, researchers had identified three variant forms of GM2 gangliosidosis, including Sandhoff disease and AB variant, accounting for false negatives in carrier testing.

BiographyMart√≠nez-Pereda, Jos√© Antonio (2019). A√±oranzas y saudades. Descubriendo al m√∫sico Pedro Blanco (Le√≥n, 1883 ‚Äì Oporto, 1919). CSED. . Pedro Blanco L√≥pez was the son of the musician Mateo Blanco del R√≠o and Emilia L√≥pez y Moya. He began his musical studies with his father in Le√≥n. Starting in 1897, he studied at the National School of Music in Madrid with teachers such as Felipe Pedrell and Andr√©s Monge. With them, as well as with Tom√°s Bret√≥n, he maintained an important epistolary relationship throughout his life. At the Conservatory of Music and Declamation, as the National School was renamed at the turn of the century, he obtained the First Prize for Piano in 1902. In Madrid, he began a career as a pianist that took him to Porto, where he lived from 1903 until his death. There he married his student Clementina Nogueira and had two children. Shortly after his arrival in Portugal, he joined a literary and artistic circle in the coastal city of Espinho, which included personalities such as the painter Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso, the poet and pedagogue Jo√£o de Barros and, above all, Dr Manuel Laranjeira. Through this singular intellectual, he met other characters such as Miguel de Unamuno, with whom he corresponded for several years. His Spanish friends and occasional collaborators included the painter Cecilio Pl√°, the playwright Guillermo Perr√≠n and the cartoonist Ram√≥n Cilla. Blanco developed an important career as a piano teacher, with many disciples for more than a decade. In addition, he was chosen as a teacher for the newly opened Porto Conservatory of Music, where he taught from 1917 until his death. Blanco had a relevant contribution to the flourishing cultural life of Porto in the first two decades of the 20th century, in movements such as Renascen√ßa portuguesa. A passionate and charismatic artist, he had an undeniable influence on the community that he took advantage of to carry out important social work. In Porto he developed a close friendship with personalities of the stature of the sculptor Ant√≥nio Teixeira Lopes, the cartoonist Leal da C√¢mara and the writer Antero de Figueiredo. Likewise, he maintained a fluid correspondence with personalities from the national and international musical and artistic world. As a writer, Pedro Blanco wrote many articles for newspapers and magazines, mainly in Spanish and Portuguese languages, focused on various fields: music criticism, regenerationism and the defense of the condition of musicians, and dissemination of artistic activities of the close two nations. He carried out a very important, and until now forgotten, work of cultural exchange between Spain and Portugal, actively contributing to a contemporary cultural Iberianism. Pedro Blanco died on May 1, 1919, a victim of the influenza virus.  Selected worksMart√≠nez-Pereda, op. cit., p. 261-262.

Born in T√∏nsberg, the son of a bailiff, he gained little respect as a priest in Christiania, owing to his libidinous lifestyle. He became known as the founding editor of the Morgenbladet and Tiden newspapers, in which he espoused a monarchistic and secessionist stance. Biography Wulfsberg was born in T√∏nsberg, Vestfold, the son of Jacob Wulfsberg (1751‚Äì1826), merchant, bailiff, police chief and circuit judge, and his wife, Inger Helvig, n√©e Seeberg (1752‚Äì97). Growing up in √Ömot, Hedmark, he passed his university entrance examination, the examen artium, in 1796. After having studied theology in Copenhagen, he arrived in Christiania in 1801, where he was appointed third priest of Our Savior's Church. He lived a dissolute life together with his wife in the centre of Christiania; a bishop once said that Wulfsberg had a \\"boisterous and crapulous character he daily soars into, whereby he debases himself as a man\\".Rune Ottosen, \\"Niels Wulfsberg\\", in Norsk biografisk leksikon, ed. Knut Helle, 2nd ed., vol. 10 (Oslo: Kunnskapsforlaget, 2005). With reducing reverence in the biblical community, he decided to open a bookstore and a printing-house in the city. In the autumn of 1807, he published 43 issues of the military periodical Efterretninger og Opmuntringer angaaende de n√¶rv√¶rende Krigsbegivenheder (\\"News and Incentives relating to the Present War Events\\"), which has been considered a forerunner of the newspaper Tiden, et offentlig Blad af blandet Indhold (\\"Time, a Public Newspaper of Mixed Content\\"). The latter newspaper was first published on 28 January 1808, and championed secession from Denmark, either maintaining Norwegian independence with support from England, or creating a personal union with Sweden.Yngvar Hauge, Morgenbladets historie. Bind I: 1819‚Äì1854 (Oslo: Morgenbladets forlag, 1963), 14‚Äì15. In 1811, Wulfsberg took the initiative to establish Selskabet for Christiania Byes Vel, a heritage association for Christiania.\\"Selskabet for Oslo Byes Vel\\", in Store norske leksikon, ed. Anne Marit Godal, accessed 29 December 2011.\\"En reise gjennom 200 √•r\\", St. Hallvard 1 (2011): 30‚Äì49, , . Before being installed as archivist in the Norwegian council department in Stockholm, Wulfsberg published three issues of a periodical titled Journal for Rigsforfatning, Lovgivning og Politie (\\"Journal of National Constitution, Legislation and Policy\\"), to stimulate the debate surrounding the 1814 Constitution. The Tiden newspaper had ceased publication in 1814, owing to a shortage of funds. Whilst still in Sweden, Wulfsberg and Christian D√∏derlein started a Swedish-friendly paper under the title Den norske Rigstidende (\\"The Norwegian National Gazette\\"), which later has been assessed as a sequel to Tiden. On his return from Stockholm, he established the Morgenbladet newspaper. This newspaper offered readers reports from the parliament, domestic and foreign news, as well as literary criticism. In 1823, Wulfsberg fell ill and was obliged to convalesce in Drammen. There, he republished the Tiden newspaper together with his son Jacob Wulfsberg (1809‚Äì82); the newspaper is still published as Drammens Tidende. He died in the city on 25 June 1852, at age 76.

The civil war developed as a result of ideological differences, and later tribal tensions, between two factions of the ruling Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP), centred on Abdul Fattah Ismail's faction, al-Toghmah, and Ali Nasir Muhammad's faction, al-Zomrah, for the leadership of the YSP and the PDRY. The conflict quickly escalated into a costly civil war that lasted eleven days and resulted in thousands of casualties. Additionally, the conflict resulted in the demise of much of the Yemeni Socialist Party's most experienced socialist leadership cadre, contributing to a much weaker government and the country's eventual unification with North Yemen in 1990. Background Following the end of the Aden Emergency and the achievement of South Yemeni independence in 1967, the National Liberation Front (NLF) was handed power over the country following negotiations with the British government in Geneva. A broadly left- wing nationalist insurgent organization, the NLF had sought to unite the forces of the Aden petroleum and port workers' trade unions, Nasserites, and Communists. The last of these factions was led by Abdul Fattah Ismail, a founding member of the NLF and its chief Marxist ideologue. During the Emergency, Ismail had led the armed cadres of the NLF in Aden, and was supported by many of the insurgents who had seen action against the British. In 1969, with support from the Soviet Union, Ismail used this popularity among the nascent South Yemeni army to seize control of the NLF, and in June he was declared its General Secretary. Ismail pursued aggressive and revolutionary domestic and foreign policies. At home, the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen adopted a Marxist-Leninist scientific socialism as the official state ideology. All major industries were nationalized and collectivized, universal suffrage was implemented, and a quasi-cult of personality was developed around Ismail and the NLF, renamed the Yemeni Socialist Party in 1978. His government helped establish Marxist paramilitary organizations around the Arabian Peninsula, PFLOAG and PFLO, which used political activism and violence to campaign against the Western-aligned Arab monarchies on the Persian Gulf. Under Ismail, South Yemen gave its most direct support to the later of these two groups during the Dhofar Rebellion in neighbouring Oman, providing advisors to the insurgent forces there, in addition to ensuring the transit of Warsaw Pact and Chinese weapons to the rebels. He also encouraged Communist guerrillas in North Yemen, seeking to destabilize the regime of Ali Abdullah Saleh and bring about Yemeni unification under a Communist government based in the South. This antagonism toward the North would stoke tensions between the two Yemens, eventually culminating in a brief series of border skirmishes in 1972. Following the failure of the insurgency in Oman in 1978 and simmering hostilities with North Yemen, Ismail had lost favour with much of the Yemeni Socialist Party's rank and file and alienated his country from much of the region and the West. This, combined with Ismail's economic policies had devastated the small nation's hitherto low standard of living. The Soviet Union, upon which South Yemen relied for the vast majority of its trade and financial aid, had also lost confidence in the General Secretary, policymakers within the Brezhnev administration regarding him as a loose cannon and a liability. As a result, Moscow began to encourage moderates within the YSP to remove him from power. In 1980, believing that his political rivals within the YSP were preparing to assassinate him, Ismail resigned and went into exile. His successor, Ali Nasir Muhammad, took a less interventionist stance toward both North Yemen and neighbouring Oman. The Yemeni Socialist Party was increasingly polarised between Ismail's supporters, who espoused a hard-line leftist ideology, and those of Ali Nasir Muhammad who espoused more pragmatic domestic policies and friendlier relations with other Arab states and the West. In June 1985, the YSP politburo adopted a resolution stating that anyone who resorted to violence in settling internal political disputes is considered a criminal and a betrayer of the homeland. War On January 13, 1986, bodyguards of Ali Nasir Muhammad opened fire on members of the Yemeni Socialist Party politburo as the body was due to meet. As most of the politburo members were armed and had their own bodyguards, a firefight broke out. Ali Nasir's supporters were not in the meeting room at the time. Vice- president Ali Ahmad Nasir Antar, Defense minister Saleh Muslih Qassem and the YSP disciplinary chief Ali Shayi' Hadi were killed in the shootout. Abdul Fattah Ismail survived the attack but was apparently killed later on that day as naval forces loyal to Ali Nasir shelled the city. Fighting lasted for 12 days and resulted in thousands of casualties, the ouster of Ali Nasir's, and the deaths of Abdul Fattah Ismail, Ali Antar, Saleh Muslih, and Ali Shayi'. Some 60,000 people, including Ali Nasir and his brigade, fled to the YAR. In the conflict that took the lives of anywhere from 4,000 to 10,000 people, al- Beidh was one of the few high-ranking officials of Abdul Fattah's faction on the winning side who survived. Succession A former Politburo member, al- Beidh took the top position in the YSP following a 12-day 1986 civil war between forces loyal to former chairman Abdul Fattah Ismail and then-chairman Ali Nasir Muhammad. An Ismail ally, he took control after Mohammad's defeat and defection, and Ismail's death. Aftermath Unification of Yemen and 1994 civil war Suffering a loss of more than half its aid from the Soviet Union from 1986 to 1989, and an interest in possible oil reserves on the border between the countries, al-Beidh's government worked toward unification with North Yemen officials. Efforts toward unification proceeded from 1988. Although the governments of the PDRY and the YAR declared that they approved a future union in 1972, little progress was made toward unification, and relations were often strained. In 1990, North Yemen and South Yemen united into one country, but in February 1994, clashes between northern and southern forces started and quickly developed into a full-scale civil war. As northern forces advanced on Aden, al-Beidh declared the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Yemen on 21 May. The southern resistance however failed. Saleh enlisted Salafi and Jihadist forces to fight against Southern forces of the Yemeni Socialist Party. Forces loyal to Ali Nasir also took part. Northern forces entered Aden on 7 July. Southern Movement In 2007 southern army officers and security officials who had been forced into retirement after the 1994 war started demonstrations calling for their reinstatement or compensation. The protests gradually developed into a movement for autonomy or independence of the former PDRY. In 2009 prominent Southern Islamist leader Tariq al-Fadhli, who had fought for the Mujahideen in the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, broke his alliance with President Saleh to join the secessionist South Yemen Movement, which gave a new thrust to the Southern movement, in which al-Fadhli for some time became a prominent figure. That same year, on 28 April, a revolt in the South started again, with massive demonstrations in most major towns.Yemen: Behind Al-Qaeda Scenarios, an unfolding stealth agenda [Voltaire Network] See also *South Yemen Movement *List of modern conflicts in the Middle East References Wars involving Yemen Separatism in Yemen Conflicts in 1986 1986 in South Yemen South Yemen January 1986 events in Asia Yemeni Socialist Party ","title":"South Yemen Civil War"},{"id":"34219624","text":"Tarom (, also Romanized as ≈¢ƒÅrom) is a village in Kakavand-e Gharbi Rural District, Kakavand District, Delfan County, Lorestan Province, Iran.

The music was written by Peter Mills with a book by Peter Mills and Cara Reichel. The story has been transplanted from rural Ireland to 1930s Appalachia and set to a bluegrass- flavored score. It was first presented by Prospect Theater Company at the 59E59 Theaters in New York City April 11 - May 3, 2009. Synopsis ;Act I All of the action takes place in a small mountain cabin (and speakeasy of sorts) belonging to J.M. McFarland, a moonshiner. Among the other residents living Way Out Back And Beyond in this remote mountain community are J.M.'s daughter Maggie, the local miller Hazel Grubbs, and a somewhat well-off farmer, Luther Coffey, who is engaged to marry Maggie. Late one night, Luther stops by to pay a call on Maggie, reporting that on his way he heard a strange fellow groaning in a ditch nearby. When J.M. returns with some of his fellow moonshiners, Maggie complains about being left all alone at night (with strange fellows groaning in ditches nearby) ever since they lost their hired man. J.M. counters that Luther ought to be looking after Maggie now, but the cowardly Luther seems utterly unwilling. This argument is interrupted by the arrival of a stranger, Clayton Monroe. The tired, dirty, and scared-looking young man says that he's a fugitive from the law, though he can't remember the word for what he's done. Fascinated, the locals interrogate Clay and try to guess his crime. (The Right Man For The Job) Eventually, Clay confesses that he killed his father... with a shovel, no less! (\\"Patricide\\"... that's the word!) All of the locals are very impressed by this story, and J.M. offers Clay a job as the new hired man, looking after his cabin and his daughter. Maggie's fianc√© Luther is uneasy with this arrangement, but Maggie chases him off. Left alone together, Clay tells Maggie his story in greater detail: his tyrant father was trying to force him to marry a wealthy widow woman, but for the first time in his life, Clay stood up to his father and swore he'd be Never Afeard Again. Maggie becomes all the more fascinated by Clay and this mixture of vulnerability, bravery, honesty and ferocity she sees in him. At the climax of Clay's story about his newfound bravery, a sudden knock at the door scares him out of his wits. It's the Widow Hazel, who says she's come to take Clay to lodge at her Little Log Cabin. It isn't fitting, Hazel says, for a murderer to be keeping company with a young girl. The Widow claims that she murdered her own husband, therefore she's a more suitable companion for Clay. A fierce battle ensues between the two women, with Clay eventually deciding the contest in favor of Maggie. The next morning, while Maggie is out doing chores, a gaggle of local girls come by the cabin. They've heard rumors that there's A Wanted Man thereabouts, and they're all eager to meet him. Clay, beginning to enjoy his newfound celebrity, tells his story again, and it grows with the telling. (Twice-Told Tale) Maggie returns and discovers Clay in the midst of his fawning admirers. Angrily she chases the girls off and scolds Clay, warning him that he'd best not be boasting of his crime: it'll get back to a lawman, and he'll be hanged for it. Clay is stung by this and says he'd better be going, but Maggie stops him and confesses that she doesn't really want him to go. Clay leaves to do his chores, and Maggie ponders her growing feelings for him, wondering whether he might be the Golden Boy for whom she's waited so long. J.M. enters in a panic, with Clay: a lawman has been seen snooping around the area, and J.M. is worried about his moonshining operations. He tells Clay to guard the cabin while he goes to defend the still. Hazel and Luther come by and warn Maggie that one of her cows has gotten loose; Maggie exits to pursue it. Luther tries to bribe Clay into leaving, offering him a First-Class Ticket on the next train out of town, along with various articles of his clothing. Clay exits to try on his new clothes, but shows no intention of leaving. Luther is in despair, convinced that Maggie is going to drop him and marry Clay instead. Widow Hazel offers to help him‚Äîfor a price. Luther gladly agrees to her terms and goes on his way. Clay returns in his new finery, and Hazel admires him. Suddenly, Clay spots the lawman approaching the cabin and hides. The lawman enters and Hazel tells him that he won't find any moonshine around these parts. But this, it seems, is not what the lawman is after. Instead, he's looking for a young man who split his father's head with a shovel. As the lawman tells the story of the son's treachery, he becomes more and more agitated, until at last he pulls off his hat to reveal a bloody head wound. This is Clay's father, Leroy, and he vows that this business with his son is Nowhere Near To Done. ;Act II Hazel is delighted by these new developments, and wastes no time turning them to her advantage. She gets rid of Leroy, telling him that she saw his son headed a certain way‚Äîa way that it so happens will take him right to J.M.'s fiercely guarded still. Clay emerges from hiding in despair: he'll surely lose Maggie now. Just as she did with Luther, Hazel promises to help Clay get the girl‚Äîfor a price. Now, whoever wins out, she stands to gain: it's all Grist For The Mill. That evening, there is a hootenanny in celebration of Luther's impending nuptials, to be held in the backroom of J.M.'s cabin. All are anxiously anticipating what will unfold on that occasion. (A Wanted Man reprise). Not long after the shindig has gotten underway, Leroy returns to complain about Hazel's directions. He has acquired another bloody wound, this time from J.M.'s shotgun, after Hazel sent him towards the moonshine still. Leroy hears music from the backroom and looks in on the hoedown. There he sees Clay dancing with Maggie and goes into a frenzy, shouting \\"I'll kill him!\\" But Hazel, with the help of a couple of local boys, is able to subdue Leroy, ply him with moonshine, and convince the vengeful father that That Ain't Him. Once more, she sends Leroy on his way, this time to live as a hermit, as she has convinced him that he's clearly lost his wits. Maggie and Clay duck out of the dancing for a breather and a bit of canoodling. Their attraction has blossomed into love and they confess their feelings. (More To Me) Clay asks Maggie to marry him instead of Luther, and Maggie happily agrees. J.M and Luther find the lovers together, and Maggie announces her new intentions to them. J.M. protests at the idea of having a murderer for a son-in-law, saying that Inlaws and Outlaws don't mix. Luther tries in vain to persuade Maggie from her decision, and appeals to J.M., reminding him of all the livestock he'd be getting into the bargain. But in the end, J.M. decides that accepting Clay is the wiser and safer course. Leroy returns yet again. He sees Clay, and this time there can be no mistaking it: that's his son. All hell breaks loose‚Äîpandemonium ensues, with everyone at Sixes And Sevens. Eventually, J.M. gets his shotgun and calls a halt to the madness. J.M. believes that he has caught the revenuer who was looking for his still, but the truth about who Leroy is soon comes out. Maggie is shocked to learn of Clay's deception, but Clay is determined to prove himself to her. He tells his father that it's time they finish this once and for all, and the two of them step outside. The locals crowd eagerly at the windows, as sounds of a furious battle are heard, climaxing in a sickening crunch and a splatter of blood on the windows. Clay returns, grimly. Having now witnessed a murder first-hand, the locals begin to turn on Clay and start to talk of lynching. Clay faces Maggie and tells her that he's not sorry for what he's done. He may have been a liar and a coward before, but now he truly has changed. He implores her to come with him and they'll find a new life together somewhere. (West of Where I Been) Maggie considers, and then sadly slips a rope over Clay as the lynch mob tries to drag him out of the cabin. It is at this point that the indestructible Leroy comes crawling in the door one last time. He's not dead, and he's actually proud of his son now. He tells the stunned locals that nobody's gonna hang his boy; he's coming home a hero. But Clay rejects this. He's not going with his father, and he's not staying with Maggie. He'll go his own way from now on. Clay leaves, and Maggie realizes that she has lost her one true golden boy of the Blue Ridge.

Pomer, 'Max Eitingon (1881-1943): The Organization of Psychoanalytic Training', in Franz Alexander, Samuel Eisenstein & Martin Grotjahn, Psychoanalytic Pioneers, Transaction Publishers, 1995, pp.51-62 Eitingon was cofounder and president from 1920 to 1933 of the Berlin Psychoanalytic Polyclinic. He was also director and patron of the Internationaler Psychoanalytischer Verlag (1921-1930), president of the International Psychoanalytic Association (1927-1933), founder and president of the International Training Committee (1925-1943), and founder of the Palestine Psychoanalytic Society (1934) and of the Psychoanalytic Institute of Israel.Moreau Ricaud, Michelle, 'Max Eitingon', International Dictionary of Psychoanalysis. Reprinted online at answers.com Life Eitingon was born to an extremely wealthy Orthodox Jewish family in Mohilev, Imperial Russia, the son of a successful fur trader Chaim Eitingon. When he was twelve the family moved to Leipzig. He studied at private school and at universities in Halle, Heidelberg, and Marburg ‚Äî studying philosophy under the neo-Kantian Hermann Cohen ‚Äî before studying medicine at the University of Leipzig in 1902. Before completing his dissertation, Eitingon worked as an intern at Eugen Bleuler's Burgh√∂lzli Clinic in Zurich. In 1907 he was sent by Bleuler to meet Freud, and in 1908-9 underwent five weeks of analysis with Freud: \\"This was indeed the first training analysis!\\"Ernest Jones, Vol. II, 1957, quoted by Pomer, p.54 He completed his dissertation, Effect of an epileptic attack on mental associations, with Carl Jung's help, and settled in Berlin. In 1913 he married Mirra Jacovleina Raigorodsky, an actress with the Moscow Art Theater. During World War I Eitingon became an Austrian citizen, joining the army as a doctor and using hypnosis to treat soldiers with war trauma. Settling in Berlin after the war, he was invited by Freud to join the secret Psychoanalytic Committee.Richard Lourie, Hit Men, Freudians and Furriers, New York Times, 23 July 2010. (Review of Mary-Kay Wilmers, The Eitingons: A Twentieth-Century Story, Verso, 2010.) Eitingon financed the building of a polyclinic, using Freud's son Ernst Freud as architect. Eitingon, Karl Abraham and Ernst Simmel ran the clinic until the rise of Nazism in 1933. At the Budapest Congress in 1918, Hermann Nunberg had \\"declared that no one could any longer learn to practice psychoanalysis without having been analyzed himself\\":Eitingon, 1937, quoted in Pomer. as Eitingon's 1922 report made clear, this rule was formalized in the practice of the Polyclinic: At the 1925 Bad Homburg Congress, Eitingon proposed that the Berlin system of psychoanalytic training should be made an international standard under an International Training Commission. Eitingon was appointed president of the ITC, and kept the position until his death in 1943. After the family business suffered in the US Great Depression, Eitingon was forced for the first time to take a patient to earn his living. In 1932 he had a cerebral thrombosis. On Freud's advice, Eitingon left Germany in September 1933 and emigrated to Palestine. In 1934 he founded the Palestine Psychoanalytic Association in Jerusalem. However, despite Freud's recommendation, he did not manage to gain a chair in psychoanalysis at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Max Eitingon was described in several books as an important figure in a group of Soviet agents who conducted assassinations in Europe and Mexico, including murders of Ignace Reiss, General Yevgeny Miller, and Lev Sedov. The story was revived in the New York Times Book Review by Stephen Suleyman Schwartz,Stephen Schwartz, \\"Intellectuals and Assassins ‚Äì Annals of Stalin's Killerati,\\" New York Times Book Review, January 24, 1988, pp. 3, 30‚Äì31. which resulted in a lengthy discussion between Schwartz, historians who wrote the books, and others who disputed the involvement of Eitingon in the team, such as Theodore Draper Theodore Draper, \\"The Mystery of Max Eitingon,\\" The New York Review of Books, April 14, 1988, pp. 32‚Äì43. and Walter Laqueur.Stephen Schwartz, Vitaly Rapoport, Theodore Draper, and Walter Laqueur, \\"'The Mystery of Max Eitingon': An Exchange,\\" The New York Review of Books, June 16, 1988, pp. 50‚Äì55.Draper, Theodore, 'The mystery of Max Eitingon', New York Review of Books 35: 6 (14 April 1988), 32-43. Stephen Schwartz, Vitaly Rapoport, Walter Laqueur and Theodore H. Draper, 'The Mystery of Max Eitingon': An Exchange, New York Review of Books, 16 June 1988. The discussion was concluded by Robert ConquestRobert Conquest, Max Eitingon: another view, New York Review of Books, 3 July 1988 who noted that although there is no direct proof of involvement of Max Eitingon in the murders, his financial interests in the Soviet Union and connections with all key members of team, including his brother Leonid Eitingon, Nadezhda Plevitskaya, and Nikolai Skoblin who acted as an intermediary between NKVD and Gestapo in Tukhachevsky affair, are grounds for suspicion. Eitingon died on 30 July 1943 in Jerusalem, and is buried on Mount Scopus.

Minneapolis Center employs close to 400 air traffic employees, approximately 300 of whom are air traffic controllers. Minneapolis Center lies adjacent to 7 separate Area Control Centers, including Toronto Center, Winnipeg Center, Cleveland Center, Salt Lake City Center, Denver Center, Kansas City Center, and Chicago Center. ZMP overlies or abuts 18 approach control facilities (including APN, MBS, GRB, M98, DLH, YQT, GFK, FAR, MOT, BIS, FSD, SUX, LNK, OMA, DSM, STJ, RST, and MKE approaches) and is responsible for approximately 210 uncontrolled airports with authorized instrument approach procedures. Basic Breakdown of Airspace Minneapolis Center is divided into six Areas, numbered 1 through 6. Each area contains up to 7 sectors. Each of the six areas is delegated at least one high altitude and one low altitude sector. AREA 1 Area 1 is located over the northern Great Lakes. It contains four low altitude sectors and two high altitude sectors. Area 1 borders or overlies 9 approach control facilities, three class D airports, and borders 4 Area Control centers. Area 1 handles a wide array of traffic, including sequencing into Minneapolis and Chicago, several large military complexes, and provides arrival and departure services at many smaller airports. Traffic in Area 1 is extremely seasonal in nature, with traffic increasing in volume and complexity during the summer months, particularly during the EAA AirVenture air show in late July and Early August. AREA 2 Area 2 is a terminal arrival/departure area located to the north and east of Minneapolis and is concerned primarily with commercial aviation into and out of Minneapolis St. Paul International Airport (MSP). Traffic flow is consistent through the year with a small increase in workload in the summer due to increased general aviation activity. Area 2 also controls low altitude traffic, FL230 and below in the north half of Minnesota and most of Wisconsin. It provides approach and arrival services to all aircraft in those areas who do not have a dedicated approach control of their own. AREA 3 Area 3 is a terminal arrival/departure area located to the south and west of Minneapolis and is also concerned primarily with commercial aviation into and out of MSP. Area 3 works with both Minneapolis and Rochester approaches, and provides radar and non-radar services for numerous secondary airports. Complexity is increased with additional aircraft spacing to multiple large airports, including JFK, EWR, DEN and DFW and ORD. AREA 4 Area 4 overlies a large portion of the Midwest, including most of North Dakota, South Dakota, and northern Minnesota. A combination of low and high altitude sectors, Area 4 provides initial sequencing of MSP arrivals from the west, manages westbound MSP departures, sequences ORD arrivals, and implements traffic management initiatives for traffic landing in the northeast portion of the country. Area 4 also contains significant portions of non-radar, provides services to over 100 uncontrolled airports, works with six approach controls, and deals with significant levels of military activity. AREA 5 Area 5 overlies southeastern South Dakota, northeastern Nebraska, and northwestern Iowa. Area 5 is split evenly between high and low altitude, and handles a wide variety of over flight, arrival, international, and local traffic. Area 5 works with several Class D airports and 5 approach control facilities. Area 5 sequences for DEN, MSP, ORD, JFK on a daily basis and handles a wide array of military and non-radar activity. AREA 6 Area 6 is primarily a high altitude area, serving eastern Nebraska, and western Iowa. Area 6 consists of five high altitude sectors, and one low altitude sector and is situated between Kearney, Nebraska and Des Moines, Iowa. The area deals primarily with high altitude east and west bound traffic. Area 6 deals with sequencing to DEN, ORD, MDW, EWR, OMA, and DSM. Traffic complexity and load remains fairly consistent throughout the year.

The screenplay concerns a coven of devil-worshipping necrophiles that moves to Los Angeles and sets up their base of operations out of a funeral home. Plot Young, attractive Los Angeles heiress Lindsay Finch has a habit of dressing in mourning and attending wakes for men she never knew. When everyone else leaves, she kneels before the coffins and kisses the corpses passionately. However, at the many parties she holds at her house, she shows no interest in any of the (living) men. She is also fixated with her deceased father, frequently daydreaming about her childhood with him and putting her hair in pigtails to visit his grave. Her friend Wade Farrow is romantically interested in her, but she rejects his affections. Meanwhile, mortician Fred McSweeney notices Lindsay's attendance at the wakes and, although she won't admit to her secret passion, he recognizes her as a kindred spirit. Fred has a Satanic coven that meets after hours in the mortuary for necrophilic orgies with the latest cadavers. At one point, Fred picks up a gay male hustler under the guise of wanting to engage in sex. Fred brings him to the mortuary where he straps him down and embalms him alive by pumping him full of formaldehyde. Fred eventually coaxes Lindsay to join his group. When Wade follows her to the funeral home, he stumbles across one of the group preparing a body for the coming orgy, and is killed before being sexually ravaged by the cult. At one of the wakes, Lindsay meets and finds herself drawn to the deceased's brother, art gallery owner Alex Martin. An intense romance begins, Lindsay's first real relationship. The two get married, but Lindsay can't bring herself to consummate the marriage, and Alex is confused and frustrated by his new wife's inability to return his affections. Alex sees Lindsay entering Fred's mortuary one afternoon and grows suspicious of her day-to-day activities. During a conversation with Miss Pritchard, the maid at Lindsay's home, Alex learns that Lindsay developed an unhealthy obsession with her dead father at a young age, and that Lindsay would have her drive her to his grave every day. Alex drives to the cemetery, and finds Lindsay in a childlike state, frolicking around her father's grave. His appearance there startles her, and Lindsay flees in her car. The following day, Alex attempts to confront her again over the incident, and they briefly become copacetic. They plan to go into the country to visit Alex's family for dinner, but Lindsay claims to feel ill, and encourages Alex to go alone. Before leaving, Alex opens a registered letter addressed to Lindsay from Fred's funeral parlor, notifying of a meeting that night. Alex attends the family dinner without Lindsay, but leaves early and drives to Fred's funeral parlor. He enters the building and stumbles upon Lindsay and the rest of the cult about to engage in sex with a male corpse. Upon seeing Alex, Fred stabs him to death. Lindsay is brought home by Fred, who gives her a sedative before telling her that he has \\"prepared\\" Alex, and that he is in the bedroom waiting for her. While Lindsay lies there, she remembers her inadvertent shooting of her father during her childhood, which resulted in his death. Lindsay stumbles into Alex's bedroom, where she finds Fred fondling Alex's corpse. Lindsay proceeds to clobber Fred to death with a statue before lying beside Alex.

Born to a patrician Catholic family in Santiago, she published two books before she was twenty-one‚Äîunder another pseudonym, Juana In√©s de la Cruz (a variation upon the name of the seventeenth century Mexican poet and nun). In 1916, she met and eloped with the poet Pablo de Rokha (who was born Carlos Diaz Loyola). Together they invented her nom de plume. The De Rokha marriage produced nine children, seven of whom survived infancy. The De Rokha family, though touched several times by tragedy, became a famously accomplished Chilean clan. From the late 1920s through the late 1940s, Win√©tt de Rokha published four collections of poetry upon which her literary reputation today largely rests: Formas del Sue√±o (1927), Cantoral (1936), Oniromancia (1943), and El Valle Pierde Su Atm√≥sfera (1949). Biography Win√©tt de Rokha, born Luisa Victoria Anabal√≥n Sanderson, was the daughter of Indalecio Anab√≥lon Urz√∫a, a general in the Chilean army, and Luisa Sanderson Mardones, a Santiago society lady. Biographical entries have usually listed Win√©tt's date of birth as 1892 but, according to a 2004 interview with Luk√≥ de Rokha, her parents Pablo and Win√©tt were both born in the year 1894. Win√©tt's only brother, Carlos Anabal√≥n Sanderson, was a judge who later became chief justice of Chile's Supreme Court. She credited her maternal grandfather, the classicist and scholar Domingo Sanderson, with introducing her as a young girl to literature and with first opening a door for her upon intellectual vistas beyond those of the Catholic faith. In 1939, Win√©tt and Pablo together founded the communist and anti-fascist literary journal and publishing house Multitud (whose slogan was \\"For bread, peace, and the liberty of the world\\"). Chilean academic Mar√≠a In√©s Zald√≠var describes the tension between Win√©tt's origins and her life as poet, communist, and wife of Pablo de Rokha: \\"[She], in the personal as much in the public sphere, was a woman whose life and work, strongly interlaced, resists simple classifications. Her family background was very traditional, as she was born to an observant Catholic family in the upper ranks of Santiago society‚Äîa family that even had pretensions to nobility‚Äîbut for the length of her life she committed herself instead to the pains and joys of a marriage of equals, to art as a form of life, and to ideologies that resolutely sought social justice and so clashed with the social milieu from which she came.\\" Win√©tt de Rokha died in 1951 of cancer. Critical Reception Win√©tt de Rokha may have been best known in her lifetime for poems of social protest, such as her lines written in solidarity with the Communists fighting Franco in Spain, or verses in praise of figures that included Lenin, Rosa Luxemburg, and the children of the Soviet Union. Many of her poems in Formas del Sue√±o, Cantoral, and Oniromancia could be called surrealist, and have indeed been celebrated for the dream-like power of their images. The Chilean poet and visual artist Ludwig Zeller, in a 1945 review published in El Diario, characterized the poetry of Oniromancia as \\"verse carved into the root of the unconscious, overborne by swells of symbol and myth, full of tenderness and a pleasing melancholy toward everything that is past.\\" Zeller also singled out for praise De Rokha's \\"indisputable pictorial sense.\\" The poems in the three books mentioned above are all free verse. Most are short lyrics. Longer poems from these books include \\"Forms of Dream\\" (\\"Formas del Sue√±o\\"), \\"Language without Words\\" (\\"Lenguaje sin Palabras\\"), and \\"Chain of Verbs\\" (\\"Cadena de Verbos\\"). Win√©tt de Rokha's poetic reputation fell into obscurity in the decades following the publication of a posthumous collected volume of her work, Suma y Destino, in 1951. The editors of a recent selected edition and a recent critical collected edition of Win√©tt de Rokha's poetry both note that her own literary accomplishments were unfortunately overshadowed by her partnership with a man widely considered to be one of the great Chilean poets of the twentieth century. As the critic Javier Bello writes, \\"her books, her poems, her ideas, seem not to have been taken seriously beyond their place next to Pablo, next to the cultural network woven by the De Rokha marriage and everyone surrounding the couple.\\" Bello considers the cryptic and difficult prose poems of El Valle Pierde Su Atm√≥sfera to be De Rokha's most innovative contribution to Latin American poetry.

Research  Gallo studies how humans interact with the environment and protect themselves from infection. He discovered that cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides(Cathelicidins) are present during wound repair. Subsequent work from his laboratory used molecular techniques to produce a knock out mouse that has shown how cathelicidin antimicrobials protect against infection in several organs including the skin. By using a wide variety of biochemical and genetic tools his work has also shown that other antimicrobial peptides and elements of innate immunity such as Toll-like receptors and Hyaluronan influence human health. His work has translated into a new understanding of the cause of rosacea, a finding with immediate therapeutic implications. Most recently his research has defined biochemical mechanisms through which Vitamin D and the normal skin microflora Microbiome can control immune responses. These latest findings have advanced understanding of the Hygiene hypothesis, Atopic Dermatitis and Rosacea. His analysis of the function of the human skin microbiome is leading discovery of new therapeutic approaches to disease by discovering molecules from bacteria on the skin that can be used for drugs.

He began his career young, while still studying in Madrid and before the war had already exhibited in various places in Europe. His opposition to Francisco Franco, forced him into exile, with intellectuals and artists in the country arranging his asylum. His career here included a Guggenheim Fellowship with major exhibitions in Washington DC and New York along with exhibitions at the Museo de Arte Moderno and the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico. Despite his success, he never forgot his Spanish roots, with an exhibition in Madrid in 1971 and a return to his hometown of Montoro in 1981, after the death of Franco. Life Rodr√≠guez Luna was born in the town of Montoro in the C√≥rdoba province of Spain. He began his art studies when he was thirteen, first at the Escuela de Bellas Artes in Seville. In 1927, he moved to Madrid to study at the Escuela de Bellas Artes there, meeting Jos√© Planes, Enrique Climent, Arturo Souto and Francisco Mateos, with whom he formed the Artistas Independientes group. With the rise of Franco, he fled Spain, winding up in concentration camps in Argel√®s-sur-Mer and Brand, experiences represented in the later published Diez aguafuertes. L√°zaro C√°rdenas and a list of artists and intellectuals worked to bring him as an exile to Mexico City in 1939. Rodr√≠guez Luna lived in Mexico for forty six years. Although he developed his career in Mexico, he never forgot his Spanish roots. In the 1960s, Spanish cinematographers petitioned to let him back in the country to see his aging parents, but by the time he could do so, his father had died and his mother did not recognize him. He returned again in 1975 to exhibit at the Juana Mord√≥ Gallery. In 1981, after the death of Franco, Rodr√≠guez Luna was able to return permanently to Spain, settling back in his hometown of Montoro, where he donated paintings to start a museum in his name. He continued to paint until his death in the town in 1985. Career A prodigy, Rodr√≠guez Luna began his career at a young age, while still studying art in Madrid. In 1929, he was one of the founders of the Sal√≥n de los Indepedientes. This was followed by his first individual exhibition at the Sal√≥n de Herado in Madrid and anthor at the Ateneo in the same city. He also won first prize at the National Painting and Drawing Competition in Madrid. From then he had exhibitions at the Madrid Fall Salon, an exhibition of Spanish Artists in San Sebasti√°n, the Exposition of Catalan Art in Barcelona and the Maison de la Culture in Paris and the Paris Exposition. During the Spanish Civil War, while the Republican government was still in control, he was sent to the Venice Biennale to exhibit a series on the war called Veinte dibujos sobre la Guerra. The artist continued his career in Mexico after exile, developing most of it in this country. Soon after arrival, he helped to found the Editorial S√©neca publishers. He had his first art exhibition in Mexico at the Galer√≠a de Arte Mexicano in 1941, which became the only private gallery he exhibited in during his career, although he did have exhibits in museums. That same year, Rodr√≠guez Luna received a Guggenheim Fellowship, which led to a major exhibitions in Washington and in New York. In the 1940s and 1950s he was very active as a painter as well as a teacher at the Escuela Nacional de Artes Pl√°sticas. In the 1960s and 1970s he had shows in San Francisco, San Diego, the Museo de Arte Moderno, the Galer√≠a de Arte Mexicano and the Juan Mord√≥ Gallery in Madrid. His works can be found in public and private collections in various parts of the world, especially in Mexico and the United States. These include those of the Museum of Modern Art in Madrid (the youngest painter to have works included in this collection), the Barcelona City Council and the Ministry of Education in Spain. Works have also been published in two books, 10 Aguafuertes in 1940 and Danzas de los Concheros de San Miguel de Allende in 1941. Rodriguez Luna was accepted as a member of Mexico‚Äôs Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana. The Museo de Arte Moderno held the first retrospective of his work in 1959, when the institution was still at the Palacio de Bellas Artes and held another in 1980. In 1984, the Palacio itself held a retrospective. In 1985, shortly before his death, his hometown in Spain opened a museum named after him in the former chapel of San Jacinto. Since then, there have been two major exhibitions and tributes to the artists, one in 1997 at the Franz Mayer Museum and another in 2008 at the Museo-Taller Nishizawa . Artistry Rodr√≠guez Luna is one of the most important painters from C√≥rdoba in the 20th century. Luis Cardoza y Arag√≥n stated that the ‚Äú‚Ä¶ carries the model inside himself and he transcends it sin such a way that it takes form as a fiction which is more real than reality itself.‚Äù He was one of the first artists in Spain to embrace the European trends of the 1920s, with his early work influenced by Surrealism and Expressionism . During his career, his work would evolve from this to forms of abstractionism in his later career with phases in social realism and neo- Cubism . Social realism was most prominent during the Spanish Civil War and early exile in Mexico. In Spain still, he used it to denounce what was happening in the country. After arriving to Mexico, he first worked on themes consistent with the then-dominant Mexican muralism movement, but soon returned to themes from before the war. Works from the height of his career in the 1940s and 1950s show a lyrical sense, with colors such as grays, blacks, blues and whites dominant. Dark areas predominate and stand out, with areas of nothing but a single color. The artist himself stated that ‚ÄúTo paint is to search for the depth and density of emotion which and object may have.‚Äù References 20th-century Spanish painters Spanish male painters Spanish Expressionist painters 1910 births 1985 deaths ","title":"Antonio Rodr√≠guez Luna"},{"id":"34219883","text":"Jamshidabad (, also Romanized as Jamshƒ´dƒÅbƒÅd) is a village in Kakavand-e Sharqi Rural District, Kakavand District, Delfan County, Lorestan Province, Iran.

History  Before the Meiji Restoration, more than 70,000 municipalities in Japan were small entities. The new centralized government viewed them as potential areas of unrest. Two waves of municipal mergers intended to weaken those entities. This resulted in ch≈çnaikai, informal associations taking the place of former village or neighbourhood communities. During World War II, these associations were involved in many points: * Civil defense against bombing and ensuing fires * Maintenance of roads and public buildings * Supply of food and first aid gear During the Occupation of Japan, the American provisional government forbade them. They were allowed only after the Treaty of San Francisco in 1951. Nowadays, the ch≈çnaikai are put forward again and are gathered in a nationwide .  Characteristics  A ch≈çnaikai deals with five criteria:  Territory  The local government generally covers the same area. According to the evolution of the population, the ch≈çnaikai may be divided.  Membership  The household is the basic member. Some sections may exist for women, children or elderly, taking part in the proper activities. Sometimes, a corporate membership is also allowed for financial issues.  Automatic membership  For a new household, membership is not mandatory, but gives access to a lot of facilities. Non-member households are somewhat ostracized from the community and are treated as strangers . People in rented rooms, typically students or young salary men, are said to be member of the household of the landowner. Because apartment tenants reside in the community temporarily, and the associations are geared toward homeowners and families, they are under no social pressure to join.  Activities  They attend a wide range: * Security of the neighbourhood, especially during natural disasters * Waste management, * Aid to the elderly and disabled * Cultural and sport activities, aiming at a better mutual understanding * Funeral activities ** When a member of the community dies, association members assist the bereaved family with funeral arrangements * Assistance in case of a disaster ** When a house is destroyed by fire or other means, association members provide the homeless family with shelter, food, clothing, and monetary donations to assist the family in replacing their home and other lost possessions. ** When a disaster hits a region, associations in neighboring communities participate in assistance efforts.

It is being exploited for geothermal energy. Soysambu Conservancy is located to the north of the massif, between Lake Elmenteita to the east and Lake Nakuru to the west. Geology Eburru is part of a group of volcanoes in the rift that also includes Suswa, Longonot, Olkaria, Elmenteita and Menengai. It is separated from Olkaria volcano to the south by the Akira plains. In this part of the rift, the eastern margin is covered by trachytic tuffs, often ignimbritic, and some trachytic lavas. The western margin is covered by trachytic and pantelleritic pumice as well as deposits of ash falls ejected from Eburru. Landsat image of Eburru. Lake Naivasha in lower right. Lava flows of the Elmenteita Badlands at the top- center The Eburru massif rises to above the floor of the rift. It developed in three stages. The products of the first stage, in the west, are now mostly buried apart from small pantelleritic lava outcrops. The second stage formed the Waterloo Ridge on the eastern side of the massif. These rocks came from a series of pyroclastic eruptions originating in a fault zone. The third stage created craters, small cones, domes and lava flows. The summit has more than fifty craters with diameters from to . The pumice lapilli and ash beds from these centers covers most of the massif as well as the western shoulder of the rift. The youngest formations are no more than a few hundred years old. The Eburru massif today is ridge-shaped and eroded, with an east‚Äìwest orientation. The volcanic complex has an area of . There are two summits, Eburru hill and West hill. There are young craters on the eastern part of the ridge. The east flank has rhyolitic domes that were probably created in the Holocene and are still only partly overgrown with vegetation. There are widespread fumaroles in cinder cones and craters along the faults in the massif. Geothermal development In October 2009 Geothermal Development Associates announced that they had signed a contract with Kenya Electricity Generating Company Limited to design, supply and commission a wellhead geothermal power plant at Eburru. The plant would include a 2.5 MW steam turbine generator manufactured by Elliott Turbomachinery in Jeannette, Pennsylvania. It has been estimated that Eburru could support a 20 MW geothermal power station.

A portion of the city of Blythe, California, and Ehrenberg, Arizona, and Interstate Highway 10 are visible at the bottom. The Palo Verde Valley is located in the Lower Colorado River Valley, next to the eastern border of Southern California with Arizona, United States. It is located on the Colorado Desert within the Sonoran Desert south of the Parker Valley. Most of the valley is in Riverside County, with the southern remainder in Imperial County. La Paz County borders to the east on the Colorado River. The region is the ancestral home of several Native American tribes: the Quechan, the Chemehuevi and Matxalycadom or Halchidhoma, some who have Indian reservations in California and Arizona along the Colorado and Gila Rivers today. Geography The Palo Verde Valley is part of the Sonoran Desert's Colorado Desert. The Big Maria Mountains are north of the valley, and the Colorado River forms the valley's boundaries to the east and south. Other mountains nearby are the McCoy Mountains to the west (north in Interstate 10), the Chocolate Mountains to the south, the Little Maria Mountains to the northwest, and the Dome Rock Mountains to the east. Features Agriculture is the valley's most important industry since indigenous farming. Crops include melons, alfalfa, cotton and vegetables. The Palo Verde Irrigation District (PVID), with its water sourced from the Palo Verde Diversion Dam, controls the canal system for these fields. Dating back to Thomas Henry Blythe's filing in 1877, the PVID has the most senior Colorado River water rights of any California agency. The city of Blythe is in the center of the Palo Verde Valley and is the only incorporated community. Other communities includes Mesa Verde, Ripley, and Palo Verde. Across the Colorado from the southern edge of the Palo Verde Valley is Cibola Valley. Water transfers to MWD In a 2005 agreement, Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) negotiated with PVID in Blythe to fallow, or idle, farm land for 35 years. The deal will transfer water that would have been used for farming in the area of Blythe, Ripley and Palo Verde to MWD. According to a 1990 pilot study, water diversions and fallowed farm land reduced farming employment. The MWD provided $6 million in a development fund to reimburse the community for losses caused by shifting water to urban areas.* Bureau of Reclamation PDF file on water situation. California currently uses more than its allotted share of water from the Colorado River. The transfer agreement also seeks to address over-use of river water. It is partly designed to reduce overall diversions from the river. In 2015, MWD purchased more than in the valley in addition to owned as of 2004, and is now PVID's biggest landowner. The Irvine Ranch Water District also purchased . On August 4, 2017, PVID filed a lawsuit against MWD over the latter's most recent land purchase and six land leases, which was accused of illegally obtaining water rights. Transportation Interstate 10 goes through the Palo Verde Valley in an east-west direction across Blythe. US Route 95 goes through the northeastern part of the Valley. California State Route 78's northern terminus is near the valley's western edge from Interstate 10. The Blythe Airport is west of the valley.http://www.airport-data.com/airport/BLH/ Rail transportation by the Arizona and California Railroad served the valley until 2007.

He was shot and killed by ERP members on 22 December 1974 in Buenos Aires; he was targeted because of his perceived anticommunism. He was a disciple of the priest Julio Meinvielle (a well-known doctrinarian of the Argentine nationalist movements). The most widespread of his publications was The Clandestine Church (1971), a denunciation of modernism and liberation theology from traditional positions.  Biography  Sacheri joined the Argentine Catholic Action during her high school studies. He entered the Faculty of Law and Social Sciences of the University of Buenos Aires to study law, but he dedicated little time to his first profession; he met Father Meinvielle during his studies, and joined the summation groups that he directed. Influenced by the reading of Thomas Aquinas, played by Meinvielle, Sacheri began studying philosophy at the UBA. He graduated in 1957, and with a scholarship from the Arts Council of Canada he moved to Laval University (Quebec) to study philosophy under the direction of the Canadian Thomist Charles de Koninck. He graduated in 1963, and five years later obtained his doctorate with a thesis on The Existence and Nature of Deliberation. He returned to Argentina in 1967, where he took over the work of the Cit√© catholique, in place of engineer Roberto Gorostiaga. He obtained a teaching position at UBA -teaching Philosophy of Law and History of Philosophical Ideas- and at the recently created Argentine Catholic University -Scientific Methodology and Social Philosophy-, where he was invited by Bishop Octavio Nicol√°s Derisi. He would later become a visiting professor at the Institute of Comparative Philosophy in Paris, teaching Ethics and Social Philosophy, at Laval University, and at Andr√©s Bello University in Caracas. On December 22, 1974, at the age of 41, he was murdered in the city of Buenos Aires in front of his family as he was returning from Mass by a commando of the ERP-22 de Agosto guerrilla organization, who acknowledged the fact in a communiqu√© and, moreover, a file on the event was later found in a building belonging to that organization. Hector Hern√°ndez says he doubts whether Sacheri was killed by Marxist guerrillas or by ASA terrorism.

He penned the lyrics for marches and hymns that are dedicated to famous figures from Argentinian history, many of which have become part of that nation's common cultural heritage. Benielli studied teaching in Mendoza. In 1897, he became a professor at the Escuela Normal de Profesores \\"Mariano Acosta\\" in the Balvanera district of Buenos Aires. Later, he was posted to a teaching position in Venado Tuerto, Santa Fe Province. While there, he made friends with Cayetano Alberto Silva, a violinist and composer. As a result, in April 1907 he wrote the lyrics to the San Lorenzo March (composed by Silva in 1901). This march (his most famous work), commemorates the Battle of San Lorenzo and memorializes the heroic actions of sergeant Juan Bautista Cabral. He also wrote lyrics for marches commemorating the battles of Tuyut√≠ and Curupayt√≠ (both also with music by Silva) and the Hymn to San Mart√≠n (set to the music of the Triumphal March from the opera \\"Aida\\" by Verdi). He is also the author of a book; Menudencias Ling√º√≠sticas (Linguistic Trifles). Benielli dedicated 43 years of his life to teaching. He was the founding director of Escuela 22, located at Calle S√°nchez de Bustamante 260 (Buenos Aires). In 1969, the school was named in his honor. Escuela 6392 (founded in 1953) in the Bouchard district of San Lorenzo, on National Route 11, also bears his name. He died in Buenos Aires in 1934. In 2005, his remains were transferred to the cemetery at the Convent of San Lorenzo, where the Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers performs an annual ceremony in his honor.

He studied at the former Anglo-Peruvian College in Lima, today the Colegio San Andr√©s . Later, while working as a teacher on the same campus, he won the First \\"Gonzales Prada\\" Prize in 1944, granted by the Directorate of Artistic Education Cultural Extension to the best philosophy work. Career He was Rector of the National University of Education (La Cantuta) and a professor at other universities in Peru and Venezuela (Zulia State, Maracaibo). He inspired the development of the \\"Integral Curriculum\\", a curricular model that promotes a formation in values, and a greater contact between the university and the professional workplace. His major contributions to Peruvian education were in the reform in university education. These include: * The semesterisation of courses * Unification of teacher training for initial, primary and secondary schools. * Promotion of the system of university credit to enable a greater comparability between the curricula of different universities. This system is still used in Peruvian universities. * Intensification of pre-professional practice. * In 2004, he received a distinction from the University Garcilaso for having urged the universal provision of early childhood education to the Education Reform body of the Velasco government. In 1975 he was appointed Director of the (now discontinued) newspaper \\"La Prensa\\". One of his important actions was the publication of the children's magazine \\"Urpi\\", where he put into practice his proposal for the formation of values. This magazine was considered revolutionary at the time, especially in the popular sector; its reception was such that initial publication runs sold-out. Its editor Gladys Prad√≥, brought together many of the best of artists and intellectuals in the Peruvian children's field, leading \\"Urpi\\" to become recognised among the three most important children's magazines in Latin American history. He was made an outstanding member of the Order of the Palmas Magisteriales‚Äîa distinction granted by the Peruvian State through the Ministry of Education to recognise teachers or intellectuals, who have contributed to the progress of education, science, culture and technology in Peru.

Content The standard contains the following: * Electrical Supply Requirements; * electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements; * over current and over voltage protection requirements; * requirements for determination of the short circuit current rating of the electrical equipment; * protective bonding requirements, terminology, and protection against electric shock; * Incoming supply requirements and switching; * requirements pertaining to safe torque off, emergency stop, and control circuit protection; * symbols for actuators of control devices; * testing requirements; * marking and documentation requirements. Scope IEC 60204-1 is scoped to cover the electrical equipment of machines that operate in the low-voltage range, generally accepted to be 1000 V a.c. or less, or 1500 V d.c. or less. Equipment within the scope is typically built from off-the-shelf components assembled into a suitable electrical enclosure, with the necessary interconnecting wiring and mechanical supporting structures. Custom switchgear and controlgear assemblies definition: switchgear and controlgear are covered by IEC 61439-1 IEC 61439-1 used with IEC 61439-2 IEC 61439-2. Switchgear and controlgear assemblies are explicitly permitted for integration as part of the electrical equipment of machines under IEC 60204-1. The electrical equipment covered by the standard includes the switchgear and controlgear of the machine. Switchgear definition: switchgear includes the power switching components, e.g., the main disconnecting device, and breakers protecting the supply conductors and the branch circuits in the machine. Controlgear definition: controlgear includes all of the control system components downstream of the switchgear, out to the final point of control, but not including the machine actuators definition: machine actuator. The scope restricts the mains supply frequency to an upper limit of 200 Hz.

Chesterton, published in 1922 by Cassell and Company in the United Kingdom, and Harper Brothers in the United States. The book contains eight connected short stories about \\"The Man Who Knew Too Much\\", and additional unconnected stories featuring separate heroes/detectives. The United States edition contained one of these additional stories: \\"The Trees of Pride\\", while the United Kingdom edition contained \\"Trees of Pride\\" and three more, shorter stories: \\"The Garden of Smoke\\", \\"The Five of Swords\\" and \\"The Tower of Treason\\". The 1934 film and its 1956 remake have nothing except the title in common with this book. Alfred Hitchcock, who directed both films, decided to use the title because he held the film rights for some of the book's stories.

Other stories in the book  Other stories that were added in the book: # \\"The Trees of Pride\\" # \\"The Garden of Smoke\\" (U.K. edition only) # \\"The Five of Swords\\" (U.K. edition only) # \\"The Tower of Treason\\" (U.K. edition only)  The Man Who Knew Too Much stories  Horne Fisher, \\"The Man Who Knew Too Much\\", is the main protagonist of the first eight stories. In the final story, \\"The Vengeance of the Statue\\", Fisher notes: \\"The Prime Minister is my father's friend. The Foreign Minister married my sister. The Chancellor of the Exchequer is my first cousin.\\" Because of these intimate relationships with the leading political figures in the land, Fisher knows too much about the private politics behind the public politics of the day. This knowledge is a burden to him in the eight stories, because he is able to uncover the injustices and corruptions of the murders in each story, but in most cases the real killer gets away with the killing because to bring him openly to justice would create a greater chaos: starting a war, reinciting Irish rebellions or removing public faith in the government. In the seventh story, \\"The Fad of the Fisherman\\", the Prime Minister himself is the murderer, who kills the financier whose country house he is visiting because the financier is trying to start a war with Sweden over \\"the Danish ports\\". By killing his host, the Prime Minister seeks to avoid a war in which many more people would die, and the financier would profit at the cost of thousands of lives. In \\"The Vanishing Prince\\", an Irish rebel, Michael, is cornered in a tower, but a junior policeman named Wilson kills two senior police officers to be promoted in the field to become officer in charge of the case. He then tries to blame the two murders on the rebel to ensure he is hanged. The rebel, otherwise a gentleman, is enraged and shoots (but only wounds) Wilson. Fisher, however, is forced to arrest Michael: \\"Wilson recovered, and we managed to persuade him to retire. But we had to pension that damnable murderer more magnificently than any hero who ever fought for England. I managed to save Michael from the worst, but we had to send that perfectly innocent man to penal servitude for a crime we know he never committed; but it was only afterwards that we could connive in a sneakish way at his escape. And Sir Walter Carey is Prime Minister of this country, which he would probably never have been if the truth had been told of such a horrible scandal in his department. It might have done for us altogether in Ireland; it would certainly have done for him. And he is my father's oldest friend, and has always smothered me in kindness. I am too tangled up in the whole thing, you see, and I was certainly never born to set it right.\\" Fisher is accompanied in the stories by a political journalist, Harold March, but rather than being his \\"Watson\\", the stories are all written in the third person. Less a clumsy foil to reflect Fisher's brilliance, March is more of a sounding board for Fisher to discuss Chesterton's paradoxes and philosophy. Apart from the first story, in which March meets Fisher, and the final story, the stories have no internal chronology, and so can be read in any order.  Other stories  The other four stories are similar in style and format to the main eight, as well as to Chesterton's Father Brown stories, but each is unconnected, with its own protagonist. All the stories are around 20 to 30 pages in length, except \\"The Trees of Pride\\", which is 67 pages long in the first edition, and divided into four chapters.

Very little information is known of him, among which is his baptism certificate dated in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, June 30, 1563.Jos√© Almeida Alfonso, La inmigraci√≥n canaria en Cuba (Canary immigration to Cuba) Hidalgo, of the gentry, notes that he arrived in Cuba between 1590 and 1600. It is known that in 1604 that he was in the city of Manzanillo, but later settled in the village of Santa Mar√≠a del Puerto del Pr√≠ncipe, current Camag√ºey province, where he was confirmed as clerk of the council. Work Silvestre de Balboa's work Espejo de paciencia remained hidden and survived the fire that devastated the town in 1616. It was found in 1836 by Jose Antonio Echeverria, who discovered the manuscripts in poor condition in the archives of the Patriotic Society of Havana, interspersed with other documents. The poem was published without any change in its original though only in fragments for two years after its discovery in 1838 in the newspaper El Plantel. And soon after it was published in full for the first time in the second edition of the Bibliograf√≠a cubana de los siglos XVII and XVIII.  Espejo de paciencia  Espejo de paciencia is considered the first literary work in Cuba: Roberto Fern√°ndez Retamar , Introducci√≥n a la literatura cubana (Introduction to Cuban Literature) based on historical fact about the capture of the bishop of the island of Cuba, Don Juan de las Cabezas Altamirano, at the hands of the French privateer Gilberto Giron in 1604 in the Manzanillo port, and his subsequent rescue by the villagers led by Gregorio Ramos, and how the pirate was killed at the hands of the slave Salvador Golomon. Balboa had a pretty firm literary training and his work shows the influence of Canary poets Bartolom√© Cairasco de Figueroa and Antonio de Viana.  Death  A document from 1644 has been found in which it is stated that Catalina de la Coba and Consuegra, ‚Äúprincipe√±a, widow‚Äù, granted a will. Therefore it follows that her husband Silvestre de Balboa must have died that year (1644) or a year earlier (1643).Balboa, Silvestre de (1988): Espejo de paciencia (L√°zaro Santana's prologue, page 10).

After school \\"he spent two years studying in Sicily and Italy.\\"After returning from his European travels, Hadaway briefly kept a studio on School Street in Boston. (Bradley His Book Vol.2, No.3,, 1897) Beginning in 1907 he worked in India for the Madras School of Arts; he stayed until 1927. He developed an expertise in Indian visual arts and published several works on the subject. His papers reside in the Victoria and Albert Museum. He also donated chintz process samples to the V&A;, which have been displayed and published many times over the years. Early life and education Portrait of William Snelling Hadaway William Snelling Hadaway was born in Malden, Massachusetts in 1872, son of Ephraim Locke Hadaway (1848‚Äì1914) and Helen Agnes Noyes Hadaway (1848‚Äì1935). He was descended from John Hadaway (sometimes spelled Hathaway, 1617-1697) who was born in Symondsbury, Dorset, England and who emigrated to Massachusetts on the \\"Blessing\\" in 1635. William told his younger daughter Hilary that his first job was in a hardware shop where he \\"learnt the flashpoints of oils\\".  Personal life  In 1893, aged 21, he married Julia Peck (1864‚Äì1935), and applied on 30 December 1893 in New York for a passport for himself and wife. They left for Italy on 4 January 1894. On 22 December 1894 he applied for an emergency passport in the US Embassy in Rome, in joint names, saying he was temporarily residing in Naples. He then returned to the US on this passport, without Julia, on 26 June 1895. Julia is listed as returning to New York on 2 September 1895 aboard the \\"Werra\\" from Genoa. They divorced shortly afterwards. Julia subsequently pursued a career as an artist under the name Julia Peck Hadaway. She is listed in the 1910 Census as living in Suffolk, Mass., divorced, aged 46. She specialised in Italian and local scenes; a Venetian canal scene (oil on canvas, 20 ¬Ω x 11 ¬Ω ) was for sale in 1992 in the Barridoff Galleries, Portland, Maine. She died in Venice in 1935. On his return William enrolled in art school in New York where he met Jean Louise Carr√© (1865‚Äì1939), who had arrived in New York from Nova Scotia in September 1894 describing herself as a \\"tourist\\". She was French Canadian, her father had originally come from Guernsey, her mother had died in childbirth (hers) and her father 2 ¬Ω years later. She was brought up by an uncle and his family in Pictou, Nova Scotia, and had an uncle in Guernsey. They left the US together in October 1897, travelling to London as man and wife on the passport originally intended for Julia (fortunately the names were similar). They married 1904, in St Pancras, when their first two children (Jean Carr√©, known as Jack, 1898-1950, and Lesley Anne, 1899-1985) were aged 6 and 5. Their third child Hilary Stella Mary Snelling was born in 1905 and died in 1995. Jack went on to serve in the Indian Army, was captured by the Japanese at the fall of Singapore and spent the remainder of the war as a prisoner of war. He married Gabrielle Hall in 1929. Lesley Anne married Basil Owen Ellis, who worked for a firm exporting leather from India. Hilary qualified as a doctor, was a major in the Royal Army Medical Corps during World War 2 and spent the rest of her career working in public health in London.  Career  William forged a highly successful artistic career in London, working as a designer, silversmith and teacher. Jean was also a jeweller and drawer of fashion designs, and sometimes they worked together. They moved to Bushey in 1902 or 3 where William studied with Hubert von Herkomer. In 1907 William was offered the post of Superintendent of the Madras Government School of Arts, which he held to 1927. Under his regime the students made jewellery, furniture and other artefacts. William also wrote monographs on cotton printing in the Madras presidency and Indian metalwork, copies of which may be found in the Victoria and Albert Museum. An insight into his character is to be found in an anecdote told in The Hindu of May 6, 2009. Sculptor Mani Nagappa is talking about his father Rao Bahadur M.S. Nagappa's life. His father became William Hadaway's assistant at the School after an unconventional job interview. As Mani Nagappa tells it: \\"It was mid-term at the Madras School of Arts when my father MS Nagappa wanted to join the institution as a student. The watchman would not let him in. My father hung around and drew a picture of the watchman, when he was sound asleep. When the principal Hadaway was leaving in his car, my father threw the sheet in. The Britisher [sic] was impressed with the sketch and appointed my father his assistant\\". When an unidentified epidemic involving swelling broke out in Madras in the early 1900s the British government asked Hadaway to commission a painting of a victim to assist with diagnosis. Hadaway gave Nagappa the job, and he did a painting based on a cast of a dead victim. The painting was apparently of use to the medical team back in London. Jean Louise Carr√© Hadaway William and his wife stayed in India until 1934, when they returned to the UK via New Zealand. They retired to Roquebrune-Cap Martin on the French Riviera. In June 1939, after Jean‚Äôs death, William Snelling Hadaway travelled back to New England for the first time in 42 years, where he was greeted at the dockside by his sisters Mabel (Mrs Frank Snow) and Bertha Hadaway. He had last seen them in 1902, when they, with their mother Helen, visited him and Jean and their first two children in London. He returned to France shortly before the outbreak of World War 2. He moved from Roquebrune-Cap Martin into Monte Carlo, where he lived at no 12 Passage Grana. Here he was looked after by his housekeeper, a Mme Rimboldi. He died from a heart attack in October 1941. She continued to live at the address. In May 1945 his younger daughter Dr Hilary Hadaway, by now a Major in the Royal Army Medical Corps, flew to Nice with RAF Transport Command in order to recover his belongings, including furniture, artworks and papers. There followed a legal dispute with the housekeeper over ownership of some items which she claimed had been gifted to her, after which Hilary managed to transport the bulk of his estate back to England.

It opened in March 1968 and was originally called the Japanese Cultural and Trade Center. It is bounded by Geary (on the south), Post (on the north), Fillmore (on the west), and Laguna (on the east). The mall itself is composed of three mall buildings; from west to east, they are the Kinokuniya Mall, Kintetsu Mall (now Japan Center West), and Miyako Mall (now Japan Center East). Anchor tenants include Books Kinokuniya and Sundance Kabuki Cinema. History The San Francisco Board of Supervisors designated what became Area A-1 of the Western Addition Project (WAP A-1), a parcel, as a redevelopment project in August 1948. In total, 8,000 residents were displaced from this area, which was acquired by the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency (SFRA) starting in the late 1950s under eminent domain. Western Addition Project Area A-1 included the land later used for the mall. art of the of land The Japanese Cultural and Trade Center was the first major project headed by M. Justin Herman, director of SFRA. The mall was developed by National- Braemar, who were joined by Kintetsu Enterprises Company of America (wholly owned by the Kinki Nippon Railway) in 1962. Construction of the mall began in 1965. In 1966, Herman told The New York Times \\"We set out four or five years ago to try and crystallize and preserve the special cultural and social values of San Francisco, which in time tend to be lost and dissipated.\\" Mayor Joseph Alioto dedicated the mall at its opening. The initial tenants included the manufacturers Hitachi, Nissan, and Mitsubishi, who used their showroom spaces to demonstrate electronics and automobiles; Kikkoman International; the 15-story Miyako Hotel; and Books Kinokuniya. The mall was renamed Japan Center by 1970, and by the mid-70s, retailers had displaced manufacturers as consumers had become familiar with Japanese electronics and cars. In 2009, ownership of the buildings and spaces was divided between: * Kabuki Sundance Theater (1881 Post), owned by Japan Center Kabuki I LLC, c/o 3D Investments * Kinokuniya Building (1825 Post), owned by Kinokuniya Book Stores of America * Kintetsu Mall (11 Peace Plaza), owned by Kintetsu Enterprises Company of America * Peace Plaza, owned by San Francisco, Recreation and Parks Department * Miyako Mall (22 Peace Plaza), owned by Union Bank of California * Hotel Kabuki (1625 Post), owned by Japan Center Hotel Associates, c/o 3D Investments Shops and restaurants The Fuki-ya restaurant owned by Junko and Richard K. Diran is said to have been the first Robatayaki restaurant in the United States. Hotel The hotel, anchoring the east end of the super-block, was originally constructed by the Kinki Nippon Railway and operated by the Western Hotels Company as the Miyako Hotel. The Miyako originally occupied the 15-story tower, and the 4-story building to the east of the tower, which originally housed the Consulate General of Japan, was later incorporated into the hotel property. Design and features The Japan Center complex occupies of land and the construction budget was $15 million. The architecture of the site, created by Minoru Yamasaki, has been described as \\"Brutalist slabwork.\\" Van Bourg/Nakamura drafted the plans for Japan Center. It uses contemporary forms and materials and is inspired by traditional Japanese architectural features. The interiors of the mall buildings were designed by Takenaka & Associates of Osaka to evoke narrow Japanese streets, as shop facades include decorative glazed tile roofs and pillars; the interiors also include large public areas with natural lighting. Structural steel for the Bridge of Shops was supplied by U.S. Steel, American Bridge Division in South San Francisco, California. San Francisco's Peace Pagoda is on the Japan Center site. The Peace Plaza was originally designed by Japanese architect Yoshir≈ç Taniguchi, and an update in 2000 by Kenji Murokami removed a large covered walkway on the north side (connecting Japan Center West and East). The Peace Plaza was rededicated by Mayor Willie Brown in 2003.

He is recognised as having been a great influence on Cuban literature for reintroducing Romanticism, marking a new age in Hispano-American poetry. In 1845 he enrolled in Jos√© de la Luz y Caballero's college, where his inclinations towards literature first appeared. In 1846 he published his first poems in \\"La Prensa\\", a newspaper based in Havana for which he became a writer in 1849. From this point on the number of his works grew considerably. For example, he published ‚ÄúLa mujer ¬øEs un √°ngel? ¬°No es un √°ngel! ¬øSi ser√° o no ser√°?‚Äù in collaboration with Jos√© Fornaris and Rafael Otero. He wrote \\"Almendares\\" together with Idelfonso Estrada Zenea and collaborated on \\"La voz del pueblo\\". In 1852 he had to emigrate to New Orleans, USA. While there he collaborated on \\"El correo de Louisiana\\", \\"El Independiente\\" and \\"Faro de Cuba\\", carrying out a strong campaign against the Spanish government. Later he moved to New York, where he worked for \\"El Filibustero\\", \\"La Verdad\\" and \\"El Cubano\\". He was condemned to death in Havana in 1853 because of his activities against the Spanish government, but was pardoned due to the general amnesty and was able to return to Cuba the following year. From then on he worked in Jos√© de la Luz y Caballero's college as an English teacher. In general he has produced a wide range of works and has received various awards. Some of his poems are included in \\"El la√∫d del desterrado\\" and an uncountable number of his articles appeared in contemporary Cuban and Spanish publications, such as \\"La Chamarreta\\", \\"El Siglo\\", \\"Revista del pueblo de Cuba\\", \\"Ofrenda al Bazar\\", \\"√Ålbum cubano de lo bueno y lo bello\\", \\"La Piragua\\", \\"Brisas de Cuba\\", \\"Floresta Cubana\\" and \\"Guirnalda Cubana\\", as well as the Spanish magazines \\"La Am√©rica\\" and \\"La Ilustraci√≥n Republicana Federal\\". He founded and directed the \\"Revista Habanera\\". In 1865 he returned to New York to collaborate on the \\"Revista del Nuevo Mundo\\". He then moved to Mexico to work on the publication \\"Diario Oficial\\". At the beginning of the 1868 war in Cuba he returned to the United States to support the cause, but every expedition in which he took part ended in failure.

Harding won the Republican nomination on the tenth ballot, defeating former Army Chief of Staff Leonard Wood, Illinois Governor Frank Lowden, California Senator Hiram Johnson, and several other candidates. Cox won the Democratic nomination on the 44th ballot over former Treasury Secretary William Gibbs McAdoo, Attorney General A.

The Republicans made large gains in the House and the Senate, strengthening their majority in both chambers. They picked up sixty-two seats in the House of Representatives, furthering their majority over the Democrats. The Republicans also strengthened their majority in the Senate, gaining ten seats.

Early life Eyle was the daughter of first-generation Swiss immigrants who settled in central Buenos Aires Province between 1856 and 1860. Beneficiaries of a program that distributed land to immigrants, the Eyle family settled around Baradero, where Eyle was born. In 1886, Eyle graduated from the Colegio Nacional de Concepci√≥n del Uruguay and received the degree of maestra normal. Today, a wing of the library there is named after Eyle. In 1887, Eyle went to Switzerland, where she attended medical school. She graduated in 1891 at the age of 25; her thesis, written in German and English, was entitled \\"Anomalies of the ears of criminals\\" (\\"Anomal√≠as de las orejas de los delincuentes\\"). Activism In 1893, she returned to Argentina, where she worked in public hospitals. There, she began her career as a feminist activist, campaigning in favor of improving the situation of women. Such was the male domination of Argentine society that her activism was not well-received even by most women. Eye organized the Argentine Council of Women (Consejo Argentino de Mujeres) in 1901 and the Association of Women Argentine University Students (Asociaci√≥n Universitarias argentinas) in 1910 with Cecilia Grierson. Taking advantage of the centennial celebrations of the May Revolution in 1910, Eyre organized the First International Feminist Congress (Primer Congreso Feminista Internacional) in Buenos Aires, which was a resounding success. The Association of Women Argentine University Students proposed numerous laws in congress, on topics such as the Protection of Motherhood (1903), Health and Welfare (1906), Retirement of Teachers (1907), and Equal Civil Rights for Women (1919). In 1924 she founded the League Against White Slavery (Liga contra la trata de blancas). At the time, the League of Nations had begun to take on the problem of human trafficking with an international conference on the topic of \\"white slavery\\". (The name of the League of Nations project was later changed to be racially neutral.) Eyle, as president of the League, campaigned for the rights of children, in particular in terms of exploitative labor and early pregnancies resulting from sexual abuse or prostitution. In 1945, she started the magazine Our Cause (Nuestra causa) and became its first director. Through this publication, she campaigned for the right of women to vote, be actively involved in politics, and hold public office. Two years later, in 1947, Argentine women in fact, gained the right to vote. A street in the Puerto Madero neighborhood of Buenos Aires is named in Eyle's honor.

It is written by Mark Richard, and directed by David Von Ancken. In the episode, a train is derailed by the Cheyenne and Durant (Colm Meaney) orders Cullen (Anson Mount) to lead a team to track them; Lily (Dominique McElligott) moves out of Durant's coach and into her own tent beside the brothel, which allows her to become fast friends with Eva (Robin McLeavy); and tension mounts for Cullen's team in the pursuit of the renegade Indian tribe. Plot Durant and Lily's train returns from Chicago, only to stop for a derailment ahead of it. Lily attends to the wounded, while Durant surveys the train damage. The Swede (Christopher Heyerdahl) arrives and Durant orders him to have Cullen lead a team to respond to the attack. The Swede tells him that Cullen and Elam are considered wanted after the hanging incident. Durant scoffs at the idea of The Swede's vengeance. Moments later, Cullen and Elam (Common) arrive at the scene on horseback. The Swede and Cullen both pull guns, with Cullen the faster draw. The Swede kneels, pleading for mercy. Cullen smacks The Swede's face with his gun, then whips him with a leather strap until Lily and Durant intervene. In his coach car, Durant orders Cullen and Lieutenant Griggs (Ty Olsson), the lead U.S. cavalry officer, to track down the Cheyenne attackers. Griggs does not want to team up with an ex-Confederate but Durant threatens to contact his commanding general. Joseph (Eddie Spears) will accompany the mission to lead them to the Cheyenne camp and negotiate with Chief Many Horses. Alone with Cullen, Durant calls Griggs a hothead. They can't risk him starting a war, but the attacks must cease. He tells Cullen to kill the renegade Indians. The Battle of Antietam, by Kurz & Allison, depicting the scene of action at Burnside's Bridge, which is the battle discussed in the episode.Outside the cathouse, Cullen asks Elam to join the Indian pursuit. Cullen doesn't trust the Union soldiers to not take revenge on a Confederate. Joseph, Elam, and Cullen meet up with Griggs, who sneers that his eight-man contingent now includes the three men. In Cheyenne country, Joseph tells Griggs that Chief Many Horses will know where Pawnee Killer is. Alone with Joseph, Elam questions the Griggs's pledge not to harm the Indian women and children. Cullen notices the Confederate sabre on Griggs's belt. \\"Spoils of victory\\" from the Battle of Antietam, boasts Griggs. Around the campfire, Griggs jokingly describes the Confederate retreat at Antietam. It only happened, says Cullen, because his side ran out of ammunition after killing so many from the other side. \\"We won, and you lost,\\" taunts Griggs, holding up the sword to prove it. Cullen moves to forcefully take the sword from Griggs, but Elam restrains him. The next morning, the men awake to a Union soldier's screams and discover him hanging, mutilated, from a nearby tree. Griggs blames the incident on Chief Many Horses, but Joseph says it's the work of Pawnee Killer. After witnessing the carnage from the train being attacked, Reverend Cole has a breakdown and knows now that peace between the Cheyenne and the Railroad cannot exist. After Joseph leaves, Ruth confronts Reverend Cole in his tent reminding him about his past alcoholism and how he used to brutally her mother in his drunken fits. When Reverend Cole gets up to hit her, he is able to stop himself. Ruth coldly tells him that she is not her mother and she is not afraid of him. Back at Hell on Wheels, after previously being asked by Cullen if she was a \\"kept woman,\\" Lily informs Durant that she's moving out of his train car and into the encampment, using the tent she and Robert shared. He accuses her of playing him \\"like a fiddle\\" and denies her request for help in removing her belongings. Two men set up Lily's tent near the brothel. Eva appears and tells Lily to hire a carpenter to lay floorboards to avoid getting trench foot. At the outdoor mess kitchen, Eva reveals to Lily that Indians killed her family but spared her because she had smallpox. After she recovered, they sold her to another tribe. Lily describes her nightmares about the Indian she killed. His spirit wants to drag Lily into the dead world, Eva explains, and that Lily has invited \\"big magic.\\" In her tent, Lily struggles in the mud to install floorboards. Outside, Durant calls to her. When she doesn't respond, he ties Robert's pocket watch to her tent. While the men are in the woods, the Cheyenne steal their horses. Cullen suggests returning to Hell on Wheels, but Griggs insists on marching toward the Indian village anyway. Cullen tells Elam that if the villagers don't escape before Griggs arrives, there will likely be bloodshed and the two of them may have to battle the Union soldiers. Cullen realizes that Joseph is misdirecting the group to buy time so the Cheyenne villagers can escape. Joseph admits it's true but vows that once his family is safe he'll track down Pawnee Killer. After hearing an Indian call, two soldiers begin firing, but Cullen warns them to stop. Griggs's party comes upon a recently evacuated Indian encampment. Griggs accuses Joseph of plotting with his brother. A young brave appears, and Griggs shoots him dead. As Cullen, Elam, and Joseph aim weapons at Griggs, an arrow pierces his shoulder, and a large Cheyenne war party, led by Pawnee Killer (Gerald Auger), begins to attack. Reception TV Fanatic's Sean McKenna rated the episode with 3 out of 5 stars, saying \\"Hell On Wheels has created a cast of entertaining characters and while 'Revelations' continued to lay out the groundwork for their developing backgrounds, it seems as if the show isn't entirely sure what to do with them.\\" Phil Nugent of The A.V. Club gave the episode an F, stating, \\"The characters on Hell On Wheels who you're meant to hate don't last long, and the ones you're meant to like don't stay down for long, either. The ones you might be meant to have mixed-to-indifferent feelings about are few and far between.\\" The eighth episode was watched by 2.51 million viewers, and had a 0.7 rating with the 18-49 age range ‚Äî gaining more viewers and a higher rating than the previous episode.

Encarnaci√≥n L√≥pez J√∫lvez (1898-1945), known as La Argentinita, was her older sister. Pilar L√≥pez was admired for her Ballet Espa√±ol. She had become famous as a flamenco dancer, among her extensive performance credits: the 1933 flamenco-inspired staging of Falla's ballet El Amor Brujo, and the 1952 film Duende y misterio del flamenco.Manuel R√≠os Vargas, Antolog√≠a del Baile Flamenco (Sevilla: Signatura de Flamenco c. 2001), e.g., p. 197 (Ballet Espa√±ol), p. 198 (flamenco: ballet, and film). The ballet's staging was by her sister La Argentinita (p. 115). The film was directed by Edgar Neville (p. 198). The 1933 choreography for Falla's ballet, according to Antonio de Triana, was \\"achieved through a mingling of ideas and improvisations\\" in which Pilar joined her sister and others its creation.D.

Many came to enjoy the well-crafted performances.R√≠os Vargas, Antolog√≠a del Baile Flamenco (c. 2001) p.197 (her company, success). Yet during this era of √≥pera flamenco such shows seemed to direct their attention to audiences unfamiliar with flamenco.Pohren, Lives and Legends of Flamenco (1988), p. 226, states a popular view: if done right theater can present \\"authentic flamenco\\" to the public, although it was more effective \\"for audiences completely ignorant of flamenco\\" (p. 387). A gypsy who danced in Pilar's troupe was proud to learn \\"theatricality and stylization\\" which he considered \\"superior to just plain flamenco dancing\\" (quotes at 387). Accordingly, this era was also critiqued by some aficionados whose claim was their savoring of the fine points of the art.Felix Grande, Memoria del Flamenco (Madrid: Espasa-Calpe 1979), vol. 2, pp. 517-539; √≥pera flamenco not creative (519), audiences not familiar with the art (526), zarzuela flamenca (535-536).Manuel R√≠os Ruiz, Introducci√≥n al Cante Flamenco (Madrid: Ediciones Istmo 1972), pp. 61, 63 (√≥pera flamenco). \\"Pilar's dancing is feminine and quietly moving\\".

From 1322 to 1337, he was governor of Gornji Grad and from 1330 Marshal of the Duchy of Austria. From 1330 to 1335, he was also governor of Carinthia.  Life  He was the son of Count Ulrich IV and Margaret of Heunburg. While his father had completely run down the wealth and prestige of his family, Ulrich V had a very different style: :\\"... in spirit, vigor, courage, sympathy with the public affairs, striving for fame, glory and power, and even after assets, as the means to act Big, he was quite like his grandfather Henry, which he statesmanlike wisdom and moderation, and his loyalty to his sovereign. By these virtues, he not only saved his family from the threat of depravity, but raised it to a height of splendor, power and honor, which it had not seen even under Henry'.Karlmann Tangl: Die Grafen von Pfannberg, in Archiv f√ºr Kunde √∂sterreichischer Geschichts-Quellen, vol. 18, Vienna, 1857 Count Ulrich was knighted on the battlefield after the Battle of Gammelsdorf and betrothed to Agnes, a sister of Count Ulrich I of Walsee (d. 1329). Ulrich V married Agnes in 1314. From 1315 to 1323, Ulrich served as governor of the Carinthian possessions of the Bishopric of Bamberg, including Reichenfels, St. Leonhard, Wolfsberg, Wernberg, Villach, Federaun, Arnoldstein, Tarvisio and Pontafel. He also served as castellan of Griffen. In 1316, Ulrich fought in the battle of Esslingen under the Austrian dukes Frederick and Leopold and distinguished himself by his bravery. In 1320 (according to John of Viktring in 1314), Ulrich V and Ulrich II of Walsee came to grief while fighting against Verona before Padua. They were rescued by Urlich I of Walsee. In 1322, the House of Heunburg died out in the male line with the death of Ulrich's uncle Herman of Heunberg. Ulrich succeeded him as governor of Gornji Grad. He also inherited the Lordships of Heunburg, Mannsberg, Bleiburg and Trixen (with restrictions, since Herman's widow also asserted certain rights). He also inherited a 50% share of Celje; the other share was held by Frederick I of Celje, a member of the House of Sanneck. In 1330, Ulrich served as a member of a court of arbitration in Augsburg, which ruled that the Duchy of Carinthia had fallen to the Dukes of Austria. In the same year he was honored with the office of Marshal in Austria. Also in 1330, Ulrich repaid the mortgage on the fortress at Peilenstein. In 1331, Ulrich repaid several mortgages and thereby regained control over some of his family's possessions, including the fortresses at Kaisersberg, Mildenberg and Murnau, the court and toll at Bruck and the courts at Leoben and Kindberg. In 1332, the Duke mortgaged Pfannberg Castle to Ulrich V (under his father, the family had lost control of the eponymous castle). In 1333, Ulrich headed a board of arbitration to decide a dispute between Abbot Henry of St. Paul's Abbey in the Lavanttal on the one hand, and Counts Ulrich II and Frederick II of Walsee and Henry of Hohenlohe on the other hand, about the ownership of the court at Remschnigg. The board ruled in favour of the Abbot. In 1335, Duke Henry of Carithia died. He was succeeded by Duke Otto. Duke Otto decided to appoint Ulrich as governor of Carinthia, replacing Conrad of Auffenstein. In the same year, Ulrich sold his share in Celje to Frederick I. From 1342 onwards, Ulrich was one of the tutors of Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria. Also in 1342, Ulrich came into conflict with Bertram, the patriarch of Aquileia, who refused to invest Duke Albert II with Venzone. Ulrich, as commander of the Austrian army, was able to obtain a favourable compromise. As a reward, he was enfeoffed with the castle, town and district of Slovenj Gradec, which he sold to his brother-in-law Henry of Montpreis in 1351. Patriarch Bertram died in 1350. His successor, Nicolaus of Luxemburg, confirmed Albert II as owner of the Carinthian fiefs Bertram had refused to him: the city and county of Venzone, the fortresses of Oberwippach and St. Michaelsberg and Clausen fortress for a twelve-year period. In 1354, a dispute arose between Ulrich V and Count Ulrich III of Walsee over the jurisdiction over the Lordship of Wei√üenegg, which was adjacent to Heunberg. Walsee retained low justice over Wei√üeneck; Heunburg was awarded the high justice. Also in 1354, Ulrich arranged a marriage between his son John and Margaret, the daughter of the late Count Rudolph of Schaunberg. Peter Suchenwirt has praised Ulrich as a , a \\"perfect man\\", who combined all the essential virtues: wisdom, justice, generosity, temperance and fortitude.

Although not singling out Lecythis zabucajo, Jacques Huber noted in 1909 that fruit bats played the most important role in seed dispersal in Amazonian forests. The quality of its nuts led to the species' being introduced to numerous tropical countries, notably Trinidad, where it has flourished. The nuts are a valuable food resource and yield oil suitable for cooking and domestic use. This species is closely related to the Brazil nut, both belonging to the family Lecythidaceae and having coconut-sized fruits. The tree's large woody gourd-like fruits with edible white flesh are used for water vessels and for ornamental purposes. The fruit is called 'monkey pot', a name used for a number of other species, including Lecythis elliptica, Lecythis grandiflora, and Lecythis pisonis. The name is said to derive from baiting an empty fruit with food and fixing it to a low branch; a monkey can easily insert its paw through the opening, but cannot withdraw it once it has grasped the contents. The unusual shape and size of the pendant woody capsule, with its lid or operculum, is shared by other Lecythidaceae genera such as Couroupita, Bertholletia and Grias. The family is ecologically important in the Amazon Rainforest, and a 2006 survey sampling 277,069 trees, found it to be the third most abundant family, while Eschweilera is represented by more trees than any other genus. The nuts and arils are highly nutritious so that on maturing they are soon removed by animals. Bats, particularly Phyllostomus hastatus, play an important role in dispersal of the species as they eat the aril and have to remove the nut from the capsule in order to do so. The genus Lecythis is thought to concentrate the trace element Selenium in its seeds, which, while an essential part of a balanced diet in small quantities, selenoproteins being important antioxidant enzymes, may lead to poisoning if taken excessively. History Jean Baptiste Christophore Fus√©e Aublet (1720‚Äì1778) first described Lecythis zabucajo as a result of his two-year stay in French Guiana between 1762 and 1764, when he held the office of Apothecary Botanist. During this period he gathered material for his book Histoire des Plantes de la Guyane Fran√ßoise which was published in 1775. Aublet's ill-health cut short his stay in Guiana, and after a brief stay in Haiti he returned to Paris in 1765.http://www.eoearth.org/article/Aublet,_Jean_Baptiste_Christophe_Fus%C3%A9e Description 'Lecythis' is derived from the Greek 'lekythos', a narrow- necked oil flask, and the root of lecithin, while 'zabucajo' is a rendition of 'sapucaia', one of the local names for this tree and also used for Lecythis pisonis. Excerpt from Hooker's Journal of Botany Miscellany (1849) This species is common in the Guianas and eastern Venezuela, but less frequently found in central and western Amazonia. It is a large canopy or emergent tree of non-inundated forests, growing to 55 m tall. When young its twigs are glabrous and markedly lenticellate, or puberulous. Mature bark is brown to grayish brown, and deeply fissured vertically. The sapwood is creamish to yellowish white, while the heartwood is usually reddish brown. The leaves are dropped shortly before the flowers have fully opened ‚Äì (anthesis); petioles are 3‚Äì10 mm long, and puberulous or glabrous; the leaf blades are narrowly to widely elliptic, 6‚Äì11.5 √ó 2‚Äì5.5 cm, glabrous, chartaceous, the base obtuse, very narrowly decurrent onto petiole, the margins crenate, the apex acuminate; secondary veins occur in 10‚Äì16 pairs. Flowering is from June to September. One or two racemes grow from the same point or there is a paniculate arrangement of racemes, normally from young twigs below the leaves or sometimes terminal, bearing 5‚Äì30 flowers, the rachis 4‚Äì10.5 cm long, sometimes with conspicuous lenticels; the glabrous or puberulous pedicels are 3‚Äì5 mm long, subtended by a caducous bract, with two ovate caducous bracteoles 2‚Äì2.5 √ó 2 mm arising from near the base. Flowers are 4‚Äì5 cm in diameter; calyx with 6 ovate, green lobes, 5‚Äì10 √ó 5‚Äì9 mm; there are 6 petals, widely obovate, 15‚Äì25 √ó 15‚Äì19 mm, yellow or occasionally white, frequently purple at edges and apex; the staminal ring has 370‚Äì510 stamens, with filaments 1.5‚Äì2 mm long, wider at apex, yellow, with anthers 0.5 mm long; hood flat, 10‚Äì20 √ó 16‚Äì20 mm, yellow, sometimes white, with well-developed appendages, proximal with anthers, distal antherless, the pollen of hood turning black with age; hypanthium usually puberulous, sometimes glabrous; ovary 4-locular, with 12‚Äì26 ovules in each locule, the ovules inserted on lower part of septum, the style 1.5‚Äì2 mm long, with annular expansion towards the tip. Fallen androecia from the Lecythidaceae harbour a rich population of insects. A study found over 1300 insects representing 21 families, including abundant Diptera and Coleoptera, five moth morphospecies and four species of lycaenid butterflies, from a sample of stamen litter. Predators and parasitoids were also found, showing an additional trophic level. Fruits are globose or turbinate, always slightly wider than long, 6‚Äì12(16.5) (excluding operculum) √ó 7.5‚Äì13(17.5) cm, the calycine ring usually more or less prominent, the pericarp 10‚Äì18 (25) mm thick, the operculum convex. Seeds fusiform, 2‚Äì4 √ó 1‚Äì1.5 cm, with 4‚Äì6 grooves or sulci, the seed coat rugulose; aril fleshy and cream-coloured with a sweet licorice or aniseed flavour, and supposedly having psychoactive properties. The 2S proteins from Lecythis zabucajo are rich in sulphur amino acids, especially methionine.

It is the common name given to a group of village subdivisions and residential communities in the subdistrict of Liang.  History  Archaeological evidence found in Lumut suggests that human activity had existed in the area as early as the fourteenth century; Chinese and Siamese potteries dateable to the time corresponding to the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) had been unearthed in the vicinity of the Lumut River. However, the characteristics of the evidence suggests that the site was for burial rather than residential purpose.  Administration  The area which constitutes Lumut officially comprises several village subdivisions, the third- and lowest-level administrative division of Brunei. The villages in Lumut are subdivisions of Liang (), a subdistrict of Belait. Each village may also correspond to a postcode area. These subdivisions in Lumut as designated by the Survey Department include:    However, the Belait District Office, which de facto administers the communities in the district, governs the population in Lumut as two village communities, namely I and II, whereby each has its own village head ().  Education  The School of Science and Engineering campus of Brunei Polytechnic is located in Lumut, which offers post-secondary, vocational courses mainly in engineering field, taking advantage of the proximity to the oil and gas industries in the district. There is one secondary school in Lumut: Pengiran Anak Puteri Hajah Rashidah Sa‚Äôadatul Bolkiah Secondary School provides five years of secondary education leading up to 'O' Level qualification. Primary education is available in Lumut which is provided in two primary schools, namely Lumut Primary School () and Sungai Tali Primary School (). There are also three primary religious schools in Lumut, namely Lumut Religious School, Sungai Tali Religious School and Sungai Taring Religious School. They provide primary religious education, which is compulsory for Muslim children in the country.  Economy  Economy in Lumut is primarily based on the petroleum industry. It is the location of the Brunei LNG plant, a liquified natural gas plant with annual production capacity of 6.7 million tonnes. Lumut also has a small retail economy. There are a few commercial buildings and several shops, mainly grocery stores and restaurants, for the consumption of the residents.  Infrastructure   Road  Lumut is mainly served by Jalan Seria‚ÄìKuala Belait, a two-lane road which traverses the area. Lumut Bypass is a highway which bypasses Lumut at its southern fringe; access between the two roads are possible through a short section of Jalan Tutong‚ÄìBelait in the east and Jalan Malawaring in the middle, which passes through the public housing area. There is also a third access but it is not open to public as it traverses Lumut Camp, a military area.  Public housing  Lumut is one of the locations for the ' (National Housing Plan), a government housing scheme.  Miscellaneous  Zainab Mosque serves the need of the Muslim residents for Islamic congregational prayers and activities, in particular the Jumu'ah or Friday prayers. The mosque was inaugurated on 22 May 1998 by Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, the Sultan of Brunei. It can accommodate 2,000 worshippers at one time. Lumut Post Office is the sole post office in the area.  Places of interest  Lumut is a coastal settlement and Lumut Beach stretches along the coastline where the area meets the South China Sea.

In Wyoming, this snake is found under rocks, logs, or other surface objects in forests within the foothills and montane zones. Usually associated with lush vegetation. Black Hills red-bellied snake The red- bellied snake (Storeria occipitomaculata occipitomaculata) is very small brown or gray snake with faint stripes down its back. The belly is red, pink, or orange. Adult length is 8 to 16 inches. Red-bellied snakes inhabit both fields and woods, but are most often found under boards and other objects at the edges of lumber piles or trash dumps. They feed on worms, slugs, and snails. In Wyoming, the sub-species S. o. pahasapae is found near water under flat rocks, logs, and other surface objects in moist woodland communities. Western hog-nosed snake The western hog-nosed snake (Heterodon nasicus) is a harmless colubrid species found in North America and northern Mexico. The Western Hognose snake is a light sandy brown in color, with darker brown or gray blotching, their coloration is not nearly as variable as the Eastern Hognose, Heterodon platirhinos, but they often have an ink-black and white or yellow checker patterned belly, sometimes accented with orange. They are very stout for their size (a full grown 24-inch female is as bulky as a five-foot corn snake) and can grow from 15 to 33 inches in length, with females generally being larger than males. The characteristic of all hognose snakes is their upturned snout, which aids in digging in the soil. Hognose snakes are considered to be rear-fanged venomous, but are not considered to pose any danger to humans and will only bite as a feeding response, rarely in defense. In Wyoming, the plains hog-nosed snake, H. n. nasicus is found in burrows in soft soil or sand in plains grasslands and sandhills. Snapping turtle The common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina) is a large freshwater turtle of the family Chelydridae. Its natural range extends from southeastern Canada, southwest to the Rocky Mountains (and beyond, where introduced), throughout Mexico, and as far south as Ecuador. This species and the larger alligator snapping turtle are both widely referred to as snapping turtles or snappers (though the common snapping turtle, as its name implies, is much more widespread overall). In Wyoming, this turtle is found in permanent lakes, ponds, and large streams, below . Spiny softshell The spiny softshell turtle (Apalone spinifera, formerly Trionyx spiniferus) is a species of softshelled turtle, one of the largest freshwater turtle species in North America. They get their name from the spiny, cone-like projections on the leading edge of their carapace, which are not scutes (scales). The spiny softshell has a wide range, extending throughout much of the United States, as well as north into the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec, and south into the Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo Le√≥n, Coahuila, Chihuahua, Baja California, Morelos, and Honduras. In Wyoming, the sub-species A. s. hartwegi is found in permanent lakes, ponds, large streams, below . Ornate box turtle The ornate box turtle (Terrapene ornata ornata) is one of only two terrestrial species of turtles native to the Great Plains of the United States. It is one of the two different subspecies of Terrapene ornata. It is the state reptile of Kansas. It is a relatively small turtle, that is currently not endangered or threatened but is of concern and protected in six Midwestern states (Colorado, Iowa, Indiana, Nebraska, Kansas, and Wisconsin).Redder, AJ, CK Dodd, D Keinath, D Mcdonald and T Ise, 2006. \\"Ornate box turtle (Terrapene ornata ornata): A technical conservation assessment\\". USDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Region. Accessed November 29, 2008. Peer review administered by the Society for Conservation Biology In Wyoming, this turtle is found in grasslands and sandhills in Goshen County. Western painted turtle The painted turtle (Chrysemys picta) is the most widespread native turtle of North America. It lives in slow-moving fresh waters, from southern Canada to Louisiana and northern Mexico, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The turtle is the only species of the genus Chrysemys, which is part of the pond turtle family, Emydidae. In Wyoming, the sub-species C. p. bellii is found in permanent ponds, reservoirs, marshes, and slow moving streams, below .

It has resulted in a series of bills and laws that relate to the subject, and at times has been a politically charged subject. In part, this is due to the existence of two distinct types of barbecue that have developed over the last few hundred years: Lexington style and Eastern style. Both are pork-based barbecues but differ in the cuts of pork used and the sauces they are served with. In addition to the two native varieties, other styles of barbecue can be found throughout the state. History A barbecue pit depicted in A Southern Barbecue, 1887, by Horace Bradley North Carolina barbecue benefits from a wide variety of influences, from Native Americans, to white settlers, to enslaved Africans on plantations to more modern ones, such as newer equipment and methods to cook the meat. Social events such as weddings, church events, or other celebrations are often conducted as a pig pickin', where the main course is a barbecued whole pig, spawning a whole subcategory of catering that specializes solely in this craft. The politics of barbecue There is a somewhat light-hearted feud that exists between the proponents of the two types of barbecue: Lexington style and Eastern style. Author Jerry Bledsoe, the self-professed \\"world's leading, foremost barbecue authority\\" claimed that Dennis Rogers, (columnist for The Raleigh News & Observer and self-professed \\"oracle of the holy grub\\") \\"has ruined any chances of this state being distinguished in its barbecue.\\" While a degree of humor is involved, choice of barbecue type is a politically charged topic. In 2006, North Carolina House Bill 21 and North Carolina Senate Bill 47 were introduced (and ultimately defeated), sparking controversy over one of the two different styles being declared \\"official\\", as they would have made the Lexington Barbecue Festival the official barbecue festival of North Carolina.USA Today article Children's civics lesson fires up age-old debate over barbecue In a political compromise in 2007, NC House Bill 433 passed, granting the Lexington Barbecue Festival the title of \\"Official Food Festival of the Piedmont Triad Region of the State of North Carolina\\". This effectively bypassed any controversy regarding Eastern barbecue and the region, and prevented any confusion with the title creating a singular, official barbecue for the entire state. Types of barbecue  Eastern style Eastern-style barbecue is a whole-hog style of barbecue, often said to use \\"every part of the hog except the squeal\\". Eastern-style sauce is vinegar- and pepper-\\"-based, with no tomato whatsoever, and is mostly used as a marinade.Garner, Bob. North Carolina Barbecue: Flavored by Time. John F. Blair, Publisher, 1996. p. 19. The coleslaw served with eastern-style uses mayonnaise (or whipped salad dressing) almost universally.Reed, J.S., Reed, D.V.,& McKinney, W. III. (2008). Holy Smoke. The Big Book of North Carolina Barbecue. Chapel Hill, NC: The University of North Carolina Press. Lexington style Lexington style barbecue (also called Piedmont or Western style) uses a red sauce, or \\"dip\\", made from vinegar, tomatoes, and usually red pepper flakes, along with other spices that vary from recipe to recipe. It is most common in the Piedmont (central) and western areas of the state. This style uses only the pork shoulder section of the pig. As with other styles of barbecue, the recipes vary widely, and can include many different ingredients, and range from slightly sweet to hot and spicy. The sauce also serves as the seasoning base for \\"red slaw\\" (also called \\"barbecue slaw\\"), which is coleslaw made by using Lexington-style barbecue sauce in place of mayonnaise. Hushpuppies are usually consumed with pork shoulder and slaw. Pork ribs Pork ribs are a common alternative to the two most common types of North Carolina barbecue and a variety of festivals and competitions, such as the Twin City RibFest, are held annually. Baby Back Ribs, sometimes called top loin ribs, are short, succulent, well-marbled ribs cut from the center section of the loin. Spareribs come from lower down the rib cage (from the sides and upper belly of the pig). They are not quite as tender as baby backs, but are thicker, longer, and more flavorful.Raichlen, S. (2003). BBQ USA. New York, NY: Workman Publishing Company, Inc. Cooking methods Pit style A wood-fired barbecue pit. A pit barbecue is a method and constructed item for barbecue cooking meat and root vegetables buried below the surface of the earth. Indigenous peoples around the world used earth ovens for tens of thousands of years. In modern times the term and activity is often associated with the Eastern Seaboard, the \\"barbecue belt\\", colonial California in the United States and Mexico. The meats usually barbecued in a pit in these contexts are beef, pork, and goat, with pork being the predominant choice in North Carolina. Pit barbecue can also refer to an enclosed, above-ground \\"pit\\" such as a horno or outdoor pizza oven. The method of cooking the meat is slow, using various hardwoods to flavor the meat. This breaks down the connective tissue in the meats, producing a tender product. The types of meat cooked in this fashion include both beef and pork.\\"A Sociology of Rib Joints\\" by P. D. Holley and D. E. Wright, Jr., Smoke box style Contrast to grilling Oftentimes the two phrases \\"barbecuing\\" and \\"grilling\\" are mistakenly used as interchangeable words, although they imply completely different cooking methods. Grilling is a cooking method that uses dry heat, supplied by burning wood, charcoal or gas flame, and the heat is applied to the surface of the food being cooked. Typically food is cooked quickly using this method. Barbecuing is a slower process that uses lower heat and often the food is cooked by the heat of the smoke itself, rather than directly by the heat of the burning wood. Barbecue related festivals Lexington Barbecue Festival The Lexington Barbecue Festival is a one-day festival held each October and attracts 160,000 or more visitors to Lexington, North Carolina. The festival is held each October in uptown Lexington, a city of approximately 20,000 residents. Several city blocks of Main Street are closed to vehicle traffic for the event. In addition to a barbecue competition there are carnival rides, a number of music and entertainment venues, and over 100 vendors from all over the region participating. It is the Official Food Festival of the Piedmont Triad Region of the State of North Carolina. In 2012, the US News and World Report ranked Lexington as #4 on its list of the best US cities for barbecue. The annual event is listed in the book 1000 Places to See in the USA & Canada Before-You-Die, a part of the series based on the best- selling 1,000 Places to See Before You Die. Other festivals Additionally, a great number of other events of different sizes are held all over the state each year, attracting millions of visitors and adding to local economies.

The first issue was published on 28 January 1808 in Christiania (now Oslo); the founding editor was Niels Wulfsberg. Its predecessor was Efterretninger og Opmuntringer angaaende de n√¶rv√¶rende Krigsbegivenheder, a military periodical which was published in 43 issues in the autumn of 1807. Great Britain's blockade of Norway during the Napoleonic Wars prevented Copenhagen newspapers from being imported to Christiania; Wulfsberg started both newspapers to fill the resulting lack of information.Rune Ottosen, \\"Niels Wulfsberg,\\" in Norsk biografisk leksikon, ed. Knut Helle, 2nd ed., vol. 10 (Oslo: Kunnskapsforlaget, 2005). Tiden was published twice a week between 1808 and 1811. Wulfsberg was an impetuous editor-in-chief, occasionally printing articles critical of the governing authorities.Svennik H√∏yer, Pressen mellom teknologi og samfunn: norske og internasjonale perspektiver p√• pressehistorien fra Gutenberg til v√•r tid (Oslo: Universitetsforlaget, 1995), 136.

Bind I: 1819‚Äì1854 (Oslo: Morgenbladets forlag, 1963), 13‚Äì15. Bemoaning the high costs of paper and the low subscription incomes, Wulfsberg decided to cease Tiden publication in 1811. The newspaper did, however, recommence publication in 1813, chiefly owing to Wulfsberg's subservient support of stattholder Christian Fredrick's governance in Norway.Henrik Grue Bastiansen and Hans Fredrik Dahl, Norsk mediehistorie (Oslo: Universitetsforlaget, 2008), 79. Press historian Svennik H√∏yer writes that Wulfsberg was subsequently \\"paid and persuaded by the political key players.\\"H√∏yer, Pressen mellom teknologi og samfunn, 150. In 1814, Tiden ceased publication again; however, in the next year, Den norske Rigstidende was established as a sequel to the paper. It was edited by Wulfsberg and Christian D√∏derlein. The latter person was the key player in the newspaper, whilst Wulfsberg was primarily occupied with his newly established paper Morgenbladet. Following the cessation of Den norske Rigstidende publication in 1832, Wulfsberg started a new newspaper named Tiden, without any obvious connection to the former newspaper.
