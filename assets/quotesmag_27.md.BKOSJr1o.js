Georgetown University Press. First appearing in the early 10th- century Georgian sources, Q'ueli was one of the principal fortifications of the province of Samtskhe until being conquered by the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century. The name Q'ueli/Q'uelis-tsikhe literally translates from Georgian as \\"a cheese fortress\\", which was a source of the Greek equivalent Tyrokastron (Œ§œÖœÅœåœáŒ±œÉœÑœÅŒøŒΩ)‚Äîthe name by which the fortress is mentioned in Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos's De Administrando Imperio. History The fortress of Q'ueli, now largely in ruins, lies at the village of Kolk√∂y in the present-day district of Posof, northeastern Turkey, close to the border with Georgia. It is first mentioned in the early 10th-century Georgian hagiographic text Passion of Gobron by Stepane Mtbevari as the site of resistance to the invading army of the Azerbaijani emir Yusuf Ibn Abi'l-Saj‚ÄîAbu l'K'asim of the Georgian accounts‚Äîin 914. According to this source, Q'ueli fell after a 28-day siege and the Georgian commanding officer Gobron, a devoted Christian, was put to death for having refused to convert to Islam.Rayfield, Donald (2000), The Literature of Georgia: A History, pp. 48-9. Routledge, . By the 920s, Q'ueli had emerged as a chief fortress of Javakheti, a Georgian duchy which is mentioned in Constantine Porphyrogennetos's De Ceremoniis as Kouel (ŒöŒøœÖŒµŒª), so named after the fortress itself. In this passage, Constantine refers to the \\"archon of Kouel\\", which, according to Professor Cyril Toumanoff, might have been the Georgian Bagratid prince David. Q'ueli is elsewhere referred to by Constantine by its Greek equivalent of Tyrokastron and later appears in possession of David's expansionist cousin, Gurgen II of Tao. Gurgen then gave Q'ueli and Adjara to his father-in-law Ashot Kiskasi in exchange of Klarjeti and, subsequently, deprived him even of these. After Gurgen's death in 941, Q'ueli passed to his cousins and, eventually, was inherited, along with other Bagratid holdings, by Bagrat III, who went on to become the first king of a unified Georgia in 1008.

Due to its strategic location, Q'ueli was a scene of several military conflicts throughout its history. In the 1040s, Q'ueli fell under control of the rebellious Georgian warlord Liparit, who was eventually dispossessed of it by King Bagrat IV of Georgia in 1059. The fortress was then apparently given in possession to Murvan Jaq'eli, who appears as the eristavi (duke) of Q'ueli in the 1060s. In 1065 it was passed by the Seljuqid sultan Alp-Arslan during his Georgian campaigns. In 1080, the Turks led by amir Ahmad, probably of the MamlƒÅn dynasty, surprised and defeated King George II of Georgia at Q'ueli.Thomson, Robert W. (1996), Rewriting Caucasian History, p. 310.

In the 16th century, Q'ueli, along with much of southwest Georgia, fell under the Ottoman sway and lost its past importance. ·Éì. ·Éõ·É£·É°·ÉÆ·Éî·Éö·Éò·É®·Éï·Éò·Éö·Éò, ‚Äû·Éß·Éï·Éî·Éö·Éò·É°·É™·Éò·ÉÆ·Éî‚Äú. ·É•·É°·Éî, ·É¢.

Description Small colonies of Galaxea fascicularis often form low domes but as they grow, the colonies become more irregular, massively hummocky or columnar and may eventually reach across. The corals are the calcareous skeletons of polyps and the variability in shape is at least partly caused by the activities of horse mussels (Lithophaga spp.) which bore into the skeletons.Galaxy coral Animal-World. Retrieved 2011-12-16. The individual polyps are embedded in circular, tube-shaped corallites less than across, made of a limy material extruded by the polyps. Lining the corallites are a large number of ridge-like septa radiating from the centre. The polyps often feed in the daytime, and when their tentacles are extended the basic skeleton of the coral is hidden. The general colour of the coral ranges from green and grey to reddish brown. The tentacles are often a contrasting colour and are usually tipped with white.Galaxea fascicularis Corals of the World online. Retrieved 2011-12-16. A few of the tentacles are modified into sweeper tentacles which can be extended to in length and serve to deter other organisms from settling close by. It has been found that the size and proximity of the corallites varies depending on the amount of light incident on the coral, even over different areas of the same colony. In bright positions, small, closely packed corallites maximise the photosynthetic potential of the zooxanthellae. In less well lit positions, there are larger corallites and polyps with longer tentacles with greater food capturing ability. Distribution and habitat Galaxea fascicularis is found in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden and in large areas of the Indo-Pacific. It occurs on coral reef slopes, particularly where the wave action is weak. Its depth range is between and . Biology Galaxea fascicularis gets its food from two sources. The polyps contain symbiotic photosynthetic microalgae called zooxanthellae which, under good conditions, can obtain almost sufficient energy from sunlight for the coral's needs. It is also heterotrophic; the polyps extend their tentacles and catch and ingest organic particles, sediment, zooplankton, bacteria and even dissolved organic matter.Sorokin YI (1973) On the feeding of some scleractinian corals with bacteria and dissolved organic matter. Limnol Oceanogr 18:380-385 This supplies the rest of the coral's needs. Galaxea fascicularis can reproduce asexually by budding. It also reproduces sexually, with both sperm and eggs being released into the water table in synchronized spawnings for external fertilisation. The planula larvae that develop from the eggs drift as part of the zooplankton. After heavy attrition by predation, the few that survive settle on the seabed, undergo metamorphosis and develop into a polyp. This starts extruding a skeleton, budding and growing into a new colony.Fluorescence grass coral (Galaxea fascicularis) ARKive. Retrieved 2011-12-16. Threats In common with other corals that contain zooxanthella, Galaxea fascicularis is likely to be stressed by climate change and the warmer waters it may cause. Adverse effects of a rise in sea temperature may be more severe storms, a greater incidence of the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation and more frequent outbreaks of coral disease. Higher water temperatures tend to kill the symbiotic microalgae causing bleaching of the coral. Without their symbionts, the coral fails to thrive and the polyps may die. However, compared to some other reef corals, this species is relatively resistant to bleaching Marshall, P.A., Baird, A.H., 2000. Bleaching of corals on the Great Barrier Reef: differential susceptibilities among taxa. Coral Reefs 19, 155‚Äì163. and to being buried by increased sedimentation.Philipp, E., Fabricius, K., 2003. Photophysiological stress in scleractinian corals in response to short-term sedimentation. J. Exp. Mar. Biol. Ecol. 287, 57‚Äì78. Galaxea fascicularis is a common species but takes about 8 years to reach maturity, making it difficult to assess its status except over long time scales. It is popular in the aquarium trade. In 2005, Indonesia exported 17,550 live pieces and Fiji and other countries exported lesser amounts. Other threats include trawling and consequent reef destruction, pollution and tourism. Use in aquaria Galaxy coral is widely available for use in reef aquaria. It has a fragile skeleton and should be handled carefully. The temperature in the tank needs to be maintained between 23¬∞ and 27 ¬∞C (74¬∞ and 81 ¬∞F). The coral needs to be in a well lit area with a low or moderate water flow. It should not be placed within of any other coral or sessile invertebrate because it uses its sweeper tentacles to sting intruders and defend its territory. Cultivated corals can be propagated by sawing the skeleton into lengths and suspending the pieces on threads. Feeding can be conveniently done using the nauplius larvae of the brine shrimp, Artemia salina. These are commercially available for live feeding in the form of cysts which hatch within 24 hours, or as a dead, pasteurized product known as \\"Instant baby brine shrimp\\" (IBBS) with a long shelf life. The nutritional value of the larvae can be enhanced by feeding them with special lipid concentrates or other products which accumulate in the tissues. IBBS can in this way be enriched with probiotics or used as a carrier of specific antibiotics to treat coral diseases.

He is the unofficial leader of the Vanguard of Red Youth (AKM). In 2011 and 2012, he helped lead a series of protests against Vladimir Putin. In 2014 he was sentenced to 4¬π‚ÅÑ‚ÇÇ years in a penal camp for organizing the May 2012 protest which ended in violence between the police and demonstrators. December 2011 arrest On 4 December 2011, the day of the Russian legislative elections, Udaltsov was arrested in Moscow for allegedly \\"resisting officers' recommendations to cross the road in the correct place\\" and detained for five days. As he finished this, Udaltsov was immediately rearrested and given a 15-day sentence for allegedly earlier leaving hospital without permission when he was being treated there during a previous, different period of detention in October. Around twenty officers came to pick him up, together with plainclothes members of the FSB. Udaltsov was in the same prison as another activist, blogger Alexei Navalny. While in prison, Udaltsov went on hunger strike to protest against the conditions. In December Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience and called for his immediate release. One of Udaltsov's lawyers, Violetta Volkova, applied to the European Court of Human Rights for his release, claiming a list of procedural violations. As of 17 December 2011, since November 2010 Udaltsov had spent a total of 86 days in detention for a variety of minor crimes and misdemeanours. According to Nikolai Polozov, one of his lawyers, \\"These cases are fabricated as a deliberate obstacle to prevent Sergei from exercising his constitutional right to free political expression\\". May 2012 demonstrations Addressing supporters after release from jail, 24 May 2012 Udaltsov played a leading role in the Moscow demonstrations protesting Putin's inauguration following the presidential election, taking an aggressive approach as the demonstrators attempted to exceed the limits imposed on them by the police. He was arrested, released, then re-arrested at a later demonstration and sentenced to 15 days. Adoption of a more militant posture was a change of tactics for the protest movement, which heretofore had dutifully sought permits and maintained a peaceful atmosphere. On 8 May, the day after Putin was inaugurated, Udaltsov and fellow opposition leader Alexey Navalny were arrested after an anti-Putin rally at Clean Ponds, and were each given 15-day jail sentences. In response, Amnesty International again designated him (as well as Navalny) a prisoner of conscience.  October 2012 conspiracy charge  In October 2012, the pro- government news channel NTV aired a documentary titled \\"Anatomy Of A Protest 2\\", which accused Udaltsov, Udaltsov's assistant Konstantin Lebedev, and Leonid Razvozzhayev, a parliamentary aide to opposition MP Ilya V. Ponomaryov, of meeting with Georgian politician Givi Targamadze for the purpose of overthrowing Putin. The documentary purported to show a low-quality secret recording of a meeting between Targamadze and Russian activists, which NTV stated had been given to its staff \\"on the street by a stranger of Georgian nationality\\". The Investigative Committee of Russia (SK) stated it had found the footage to be genuine, while bloggers debated its validity, stating that at least one fragment of footage was used twice with different voice-overs. Udaltsov denied the documentary's accusations on Twitter, calling it \\"dirt and lies\\" and a \\"provocation whose ultimate objective is to justify my arrest\\". Following the broadcast, an SK spokesman stated that the government was considering terrorism charges against Udaltsov on the basis of the video, and Razvozzhayev, Udaltsov, and Konstantin Lebedev, an assistant of Udaltsov's, were charged with \\"plotting mass disturbances\\". Udaltsov was arrested by a squad of masked commandos on 17 October. Razvozzhayev fled to Kiev, Ukraine, to apply for asylum, but was allegedly kidnapped by security forces, returned to Moscow, tortured, and made to sign a confession implicating himself, Udaltsov, and anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny. On 26 October, Udaltsov was charged with plotting riots. An SK spokesman also accused him of an attempt \\"to plan and prepare terrorist acts and other actions threatening the life and health of Russians\\", and suggested that he could face life imprisonment. The Associated Press described the charges as continuation of \\"a widespread crackdown on the movement against President Vladimir Putin\\". Udaltsov was arrested again on 27 October along with Navalny and Ilya Yashin while attempting to join a protest against Razvozzhayev's alleged kidnapping and torture. The three were charged with violating public order, for which they could be fined up to 30,000 rubles (US$1,000) or given 50 hours of community service. December 2012 arrest in Lubyanka Square Udaltsov and Navalny were among those arrested at a protest in Lubyanka Square on 15 December 2012. According to press reports, about 2,000 protesters had gathered, despite being threatened with huge fines for participating in an unsanctioned demonstration. Russian lawmaker Dmitri Gudkov was quoted as saying, \\"There is still protest and we want change, and they can't frighten us with detention or pressure or searches or arrests or anything else.\\" Prison sentence On 24 July 2014 a court in Moscow sentenced Udaltsov and his co- defendant Leonid Razvozzhayev to 4 1/2 years in a penal camp for organizing the May 2012 protest which ended in violence between the police and demonstrators. After that Udaltsov has gone on hunger strike to protest the sentence. Udaltsov was released from prison on August 2017. Upon his release, he called on left-leaning parties to unite behind a single candidate at the 2018 presidential elections. However, he ruled out future cooperation with other well-known opposition organizations and politicians such as Alexei Navalny. Who, in his words, were \\"flirting with the West\\". Political views  In a January 2012 interview, Udaltsov called for \\"a direct democracy, where the people would have their say through fair and transparent referendums, where they could interact with authorities using the Internet, where they could have a say in social reforms.\\" According to Udaltsov: \\"We are not nostalgic about the Soviet Union, we do not argue for a return to a centrally planned economy where social initiative was stifled, but we do want to preserve what was good in the Soviet system while adopting new paths to development; we want to see the social-democratic development of Russia.\\" Udaltsov supports the annexation of Crimea and the \\"people's republics\\" in eastern Ukraine. About Crimea's referendum, he declared, \\"I am a Soviet patriot and consider the destruction of the Soviet Union the greatest mistake and a crime. Therefore, I regard the absorption of Crimea to be a small but important step towards the revival of a renewed [Soviet] Union.\\" In 2017, he explained: \\"I supported the decision of the citizens of Crimea, as I am confident ‚Äî I have information from different sources ‚Äî that it was indeed their decision, the will of the people, to be with Russia. And I, as a man of left, democratic views, cannot contradict it, I cannot oppose it. The Crimeans wanted it. Whether it was right or not, it's their decision. Democracy is democracy\\". He served as a campaign manager for Communist Party of the Russian Federation candidate Gennady Zyuganov during the 2012 presidential election. Personal life Sergei is married to Anastasiya Udaltsova. They are known as the \\"revolutionary couple\\" of Russian politics. Together they have two sons, Ivan (born in 2002) and Oleg (born in 2005).

Markham was briefly married to the architect Lloyd Wright, and five years later, married the scenographer David Stoner Gaither. She worked for the Federal Arts Project, creating works of social realism that documented American life in the 1930s. During World War II, her art was focused on the propaganda effort against the Nazis. Biography Markham was born Elaine Hyman in Chicago, Illinois. She studied drawing at the Chicago Art Institute from 1907 to 1909, and subsequently worked as a muralist and printmaker. In addition to her work as an artist, Markham was an accomplished actress. She appeared with the Chicago Little Theater from 1909 to the 1920s, with the Provincetown Players from 1916, and in movies in Los Angeles. She lived with the author and playwright Theodore Dreiser in Greenwich Village from 1914-1916, helping him with his writing, editing, and typing. Through Dreiser she became acquainted with H.L Mencken, Edgar Lee Masters, and other writers. Due to Dreiser‚Äôs womanizing tendencies, Markham left him in 1916 and moved to Provincetown to escape his desperate pleas of reconciliation. While there, Markham continued acting alongside George Cram Cook, Susan Giaspell, and Eugene O‚ÄôNeill, who founded the Provincetown Playhouse. During this early stage, Markham supported herself by making bookjackets and illustrations, and later working as an art director for film companies like Fox and Metro. In 1922 she married the architect Lloyd Wright and briefly had Frank Lloyd Wright as a father-in-law. In 1927, she married David Gaither and collaborated with him on the set design for a children's play, The Forest Ring, staged at the Roerich Museum Theatre in 1930. Gaither encouraged Markham to pursue \\"her first love, painting.\\" Markham returned to the Art Students League in New York City in 1930, where she studied with Alexander Abels. Before the stock market crash, Markham was a successful bathroom muralist. From the 1920s until the Depression she obtained commercial commissions from clubs and restaurants. During the 1930s, Markham's artistic career began to gain momentum, regularly winning prizes for her lithographic work. In 1934, Markham organized her first solo exhibition in Ogunquit, Maine, featuring prints, murals and lithographs. Markham created works of social realism depicting street beggars, musicians, actors and scenes from department stores. In recognition of her work, Markham received the prestigious Mary S. Collins Prize at the Philadelphia Print Club's annual exhibition the following year for her lithograph Elin and Maria (1934). Markham sold work to the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Library of Congress and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. From 1935 to 1937, she worked in the Graphic Arts Division for the Federal Arts Project, a New Deal program designed to provide employment for artists during the Depression. The Hall of Inventions at the 1939 World's Fair in New York included 40 dioramas by Markham. During World War II she created propaganda satirizing the Nazis and promoting patriotism at home. In 1946 Markham and Gaither moved to an old farmhouse in Halifax, Vermont. Markham stopped making prints after moving to her remote Vermont farm, but continued to work in more accessible mediums such as painting, drawing and ceramics. She was a member of the Southern Vermont Artists Association and participated in their annual exhibitions in Manchester. Over the next twenty years she sold her designs to a postcard company, American Arts, Inc., and had her prints published in prestigious publications. Markham also worked as an illustrator for Children‚Äôs books during this time. Markham moved to Port-au-Prince in Haiti as a widow in 1960. She was still enthusiastic for her work, and her later work reflected Markham's new home. While living in Haiti, Markham continued to paint and established a salon for local celebrities, American expatriates, and island visitors. Markham died in Port-au-Prince, Haiti in 1967.  Work   Context and themes  In the time between the two World Wars, American Scene printmakers, like Markham, opposed the Etching Revival style and instead embraced lithography. During the Great Depression, lithography exploded ‚Äì the WPA/FAP alone published roughly 240,000 prints from 11,285 original images. Like Markham, many other artists working in this style, such as Mabel Dwight, Reginald Marsh, Elizabeth Olds, Caroline Durieux, and Russell Limbach, used lithography as a vehicle to employ humor and satire of daily life. Often categorized as social realism, Markham‚Äôs work presents extracted scenes from everyday life in a dramatic manner, turning the ordinary into the extraordinary. Markham‚Äôs work explored the incredible and grim aspects of modern society with a strong interest in labor themes, like much of the socially concerned art of the 1930s. This examination of labor roles was especially vital during Depression-era politics, and Markham often expressed this theme through the environment she knew best: theater. A repeated theme in Markham‚Äôs work, theater is presented in several prints through the unique perspective of the backstage. Although similar in subject matter to Mabel Dwight‚Äôs Houston Street Burlesque (1928) and Elizabeth Old‚Äôs Burlesque (1939), Markham‚Äôs Burlycue (1938) differs by focusing on the dancers identities as workers, rather than as objectified figures. Markham emphasizes the dancers confidence, workplace solidarity, and relaxed interactions ‚Äì allowing viewers to see the Burlesque in a new light and shifting the mood from tantalizing to lighthearted amusement. Although many of her prints depict scenes of entertainment, whether backstage in the dressing room or performing under the spotlight, Markham is also interested in other leisure activities such as attending lively night clubs and social gatherings. A mural she painted for the Community Hall in West Halifax, Vermont depicts a barn-raising. Often evoking a dream-like state, Markham‚Äôs use of light, combined with detailed realism, results in fantastical compositions of daily life (9). Similarly to Paul Cadmus and George Tooker, Markham injected fantasy into the social realist genre.

Early life Born to Midwestern American citizens living in Germany, William Suhr began his career as an apprentice to a stonemason, \\"specializing\\" in stone Madonnas. After three years there, he began studying at the Prussian Academy of Arts, where he met and befriended art historian Max Deri, who introduced him to the art of conservation and restoration. Since there were no formal restoration schools at the time, he was essentially self-taught. Working independently in Berlin, he built up his reputation through collaborations with art dealing firm Thomas Agnew & Sons. Career Suhr's success in Berlin caught the attention of Wilhelm Valentiner, formerly of the Kaiser Friedrich Museum, who became director of the Detroit Institute of Arts in 1924. In 1927, Suhr accepted Valentiner's invitation to join him in Detroit, where he continued his conservation practice.Online Archive of California: Getty Research Institute: Finding aid for the William Suhr papers, 1846-2003, (bulk 1928-1982) He worked there until 1935, at which time Frederick Mortimer Clapp offered him a job as permanent conservator at the Frick Collection in New York City. In this role, he was able to take commissions from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, including an extensive restoration of Robert Campin's M√©rode Altarpiece, now housed at The Cloisters. According to his Frick Collection colleague Edgar Munhall, Suhr's clients included Jules Bache, Alfred Barnes, Mildred Barnes Bliss, Walter Chrysler, Kenneth Clark, Stephen Clark, Chester Dale, Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen, Edsel Ford, Helen Clay Frick, William Randolph Hearst, Edward James, Samuel Henry Kress, Paul Mellon, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and Georges Wildenstein. Though he dealt primarily with artwork by Old Masters, he also helped conserve works by contemporary artists Salvador Dal√≠ and Lyonel Feininger. Throughout his forty years at the Frick Collection, he kept meticulous records of the conservation procedures he performed, including more than 95 cleaning reports complete with treatment plans, thorough descriptions, and before-and-after photographs.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Oldham East, the archdeaconry of Rochdale, and the diocese of Manchester. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. It was a Commissioners' church, having received a grant towards its construction from the Church Building Commission. History The foundation stone was laid by James Lees of Higher Clarksfield on 3 September 1827. The church was built between 1827 and 1829 to a design by Francis Goodwin. A grant of ¬£9,652 () was given towards its construction by the Church Building Commission. The original commission for the design was won by Charles Barry, but he underestimated the cost of the church, and was replaced when the tenders were received. The apse was added in 1883 by John Lowe of Manchester. Architecture Exterior St James is constructed in ashlar stone with Welsh slate roofs. Its plan consists of a nave, north and south aisles, a shallow canted apse at the east end, a west tower, and vestries to the north and south of the tower. The tower has a west door with a two-light window above it, and clasping buttresses topped with gables. Over the second stage is a parapet with an integral surround for a clock face. Above this flying buttresses support an octagonal lantern that contains bell openings. The parapet is embattled. There is another doorway on the south side of the church. The aisles are of six bays, separated by buttresses, each bay containing a two-light window with Decorated cast iron tracery. The chancel also contains two-light windows. Interior Inside the church are galleries on three sides. The chancel screen with a rood loft date from the 1920s, and were built as a memorial to the First World War. There is a central ogee-headed arch, over which is a crucifix. At the sides of this are panels with inscriptions under statues of Saint George and Saint Michael. In the chancel are a canopied reredos and a sedilia. The stained glass includes windows by Shrigley and Hunt. Present day The Parish of St. James with St. Ambrose Oldham is part of the Archdeaconry of Rochdale in the Diocese of Manchester. St James' Church is part of the Anglo-Catholic tradition of the Church of England. As the parish rejects the ordination of women, it is a member of Forward in Faith and receives alternative episcopal oversight for the Bishop of Beverley (currently Glyn Webster).

VMFA Virginia Artist File. Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond, VA.) is an American photographer known for her colorful cibachrome and grayscale pinhole photography. Biography Willie Anne Wright was born Willie Anna Boschen, in Richmond, Virginia. Her father was a musician and sometime-artist. She graduated from the College of William & Mary in 1945 with a BS in Psychology, and from Virginia Commonwealth University in 1964 with an MFA in Painting. She later studied at the Maine Photographic Workshops in Rockport, Maine and the Visual Studies Workshop in Rochester, New York. She married and had three children.  Career  Willie Anne began her artistic career as a painter, teaching art classes at the Jewish Community Center, and was influenced by one of her painting instructors, Theresa Pollak. For a while, she experimented with printmaking. By 1973, she began to focus more and more on photography. Inspired by her surroundings and personal life, her first works incorporated images of her family, friends, and Civil War reenactors. Well known for her use of the old technique of pinhole, she is also an exceptional master in lensless photography, solar printing, and photograms. Some of her more well known works include her ‚ÄúCivil War Redux‚Äù series, which focuses on local Civil War reenactors whom she followed around for several years, her ‚ÄúPregnant Women‚Äù series, which features pregnant friends of hers, and ‚ÄúThe Swimmer‚Äù series, which features women lounging by poolsides or in pools.  Technique  Willie Anne first experimented with pinhole photography in 1985. For a class project she had to create and use a pinhole camera. She utilized Cibachrome paper for use in a sixteen by twenty inch pinhole camera. With color-correcting filters she created wide-angle color prints by placing the pinhole close to the film plane. Her images were whimsical with bright colors and a vignette border.

She is a founding member of the art collective, Asco. Valdez's work represents some of the finest Chicana avant-garde expressionism. Early life and education Valdez was born in 1951 and grew up in East Los Angeles. Valdez recalls that during the time she was growing up in Los Angeles, racism, police brutality and poor schools were a big problem. Valdez attended Garfield High School and graduated in 1970. She received a BFA from Otis Art Institute in 1985. Career and work Valdez was a founding member of the Asco artist collective. Valdez started working with Asco right out of high school. She was very involved with street performance art and \\"cinematic Goth film stills\\" during the 1970s and 1980s. Valdez relates that during her time in Asco, she had \\"grand ideas about being a great painter,\\" but she felt lacked the skills she needed to be a successful painter. Instead of painting, she focused on performance art, installations and photography. During her time with Asco, she collaborated and created work that reflected shared \\"political and social concerns.\\" Many of her performances with Asco took place in areas where there had recently been gang conflict or fatal shootings of individuals by the police. She and the other founders of Asco had seen that a disproportionate number of Mexican-Americans were singled out for the Vietnam draft: this and \\"the sight of their friends returning in body bags and the elite political class's apathy to their plight scarred all the members.\\" Asco commented on Mexican-American identity and rampant stereotyping of Mexican- Americans by the media. Valdez relates how she was \\"always angry\\" as a young person watching movies \\"because she never saw the beautiful Mexicans she knew on screen.\\" Valdez' installations are considered feminist works that defy cultural expectations of a woman's role in society. The temporary nature of her installations also tap into the \\"Mexican cultural practice of the impermanent.\\" Since the 1980s Valdez has focused on her painting. She honed her skills and invited honest critique of her first works which helped boost her confidence in her painting. Valdez's painting are bright, colorful and \\"seem just a little enchanted.\\" \\"I've been trying to get away from the brighter palette for years,\\" she says, \\"but the more I try, it just comes out.\\" Her \\"vibrant\\" work is very emotive and has a sense of magical realism. Valdez's subject matter is often focused on the female figure or domestic scenes and settings. Her work draws on her \\"private experiences, the nature of which [are] distinctly painful and feminist.\\" Valdez is the recipient of J. Paul Getty Trust Fund for the Visual Arts fellowship, National Endowment for the Arts fellowship, and the Brody Arts Fellowship in Visual Arts. She won a 2001 Durfee Artist Fellowship. In 2000, she showed at Patricia Correia Gallery, Santa Monica. In 2006, she showed at the Angels Gate Cultural Center. In 2011, she showed at Fowler Museum at UCLA. Her art work is in the Smithsonian American Art Museum, National Hispanic Cultural Center Collection, National Museum of American Art, the Tucson Museum of Art, the San Jose Museum of Art, and the El Paso Museum of Art.

Herr√≥n was also one of the founding members of ASCO, the East Los Angeles based Chicano artists collective (1972 to 1987). He completed six restorations of the historic 1984 Olympic Freeway Murals, Los Angeles 2012-2017, commissioned by the Mural Conservancy of Los Angeles.

Herr√≥n grew up in East Los Angeles and for years had been sketching the world around him. He studied at Otis Art Institute and Art Center College of Design. In the early 1970s Herr√≥n was among the founding members of the Los Angeles art collective, Asco, which also included Patssi Valdez, Gronk, and Harry Gamboa Jr. Herr√≥n and Valdez had been working on joint art projects since they were in high school together and for a time, Valdez and Herron dated. Herron was involved with Asco for about fifteen years. Herr√≥n's first major exhibition was with Gamboa and Gronk at the Mechicano Art Center in East Los Angeles in 1972. His art was also part of the Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation (CARA) exhibit that toured the United States. Herr√≥n's murals often incorporate the found imagery of existing graffiti into his own work. One of his most recognized murals, The Wall That Cracked Open was painted in about twelve hours and was an outpouring of his feelings about the violent attack his brother suffered from rival gang members. The imagery used in this mural is influenced by Pre-Columbian themes and invokes the concept of Atzl√°n. The fact that Herr√≥n includes graffiti is a way of tying together the art of both the mural and of \\"Chicano graffiti\\" which he saw as both deserving \\"mutual respect.\\" He was a founding member of the punk band, Los Illegals. He co-owns a commercial design studio. Herron lends his assistance to struggling artists and those who struggle with their differences in traditional communities. He has been a \\"representative figure for the underappreciated Chicano and contemporary artist,\\" especially after one of his well-loved murals was whitewashed.

Early life Known to friends and family as \\"Willie,\\" Wilna Hervey was the only child of the marriage of William Russell Hervey and Anna Van Horn Traphagen. She grew up in affluent circumstances at Beach Ninth Street, Far Rockaway. During her youth in late 1910s, Hervey studied at the Art Students League in New York City, Winold Reiss' studio at 4 Christopher Street, New York City, and in Woodstock, New York during the summer of 1918. Her acting career began with a few silent movie roles at the Vitagraph Studios in Brooklyn as early as 1916; for her artistic pursuits Hervey adopted the professional name \\"Wilna Wilde.\\"  Professional career  In 1919, she was cast in the role of \\"The Powerful Katrinka\\" in The Toonerville Trolley silent film series based on Fontaine Fox's Toonerville Folks comic strip, which was produced by Siegmund Lubin's Betzwood Motion Picture Studios in Pennsylvania. Much of the slapstick comedy in the series revolves around Hervey's imposing physical stature‚Äîshe stood 6 feet 3 inches‚Äîin contrast with her diminutive male co-stars. While Hervey was in Pennsylvania working on the production, she met the painter Nan Mason (1896-1982), the daughter of her co-star Dan Mason, who played the Skipper. Nan and Hervey became life partners, remaining together until Hervey's death in 1979. When the Toonerville Trolley films ceased production in 1921, Hervey and Dan Mason reprised a version of their characters for the Plum Center Comedies, an unofficial knockoff comedy series produced by the Paul Gerson Pictures Corporation in California. This time Hervey played the \\"Amazonian baggage smasher\\" Tillie Overton, who was clearly inspired by the Powerful Katrinka. Around 1919-1920, Hervey's father bought her a studio in Bearsville, New York. She and Nan Mason split their time between painting and farming in Woodstock, New York, and pursuing acting opportunities in California, from 1922 to 1929. They became popular members of the Woodstock artists community, and both found some artistic success there during the 1960s. During the harsh New York winters they also spent time in Carmel, California, and Manatee County, Florida. Death After years of declining health in the 1970s, Hervey died at the Manatee Memorial Hospital near her Bradenton, Florida home on March 6, 1979.

He was a starting defensive tackle for the Michigan Wolverines football team in 34 of 35 games from 1974 to 1976. He was honored by the ABC television network as college football's defensive player of the year for 1976. At the end of his collegiate career, Morton ranked third in Michigan's all-time record book in both career tackles and career tackles for loss. Early years Morton was born in Akron, Ohio, in 1953. He attended Akron Central High School which merged with another school in 1971 to former Central-Hower High School. He was the first student from Central-Hower to earn an NCAA Division I football scholarship. Michigan Morton attended the University of Michigan where he played college football under head coach Bo Schembechler. After playing a reserve role in 1973, Morton was a starting defensive tackle for the Wolverines in 34 of 35 games from 1974 to 1976. Despite being only 6 feet, 2 inches, and 225 pounds, Morton became one of the best defensive linemen in the college game. Bo Schembechler called Morton the \\"quickest, most aggressive tackle in America,\\" and added, \\"He's super quick, reacts like a cat and is surprisingly strong.\\" In 1974, he started all 11 games at the defensive tackle position for the 1974 Michigan Wolverines football team that held its opponents to an average of 6.8 points per game. In 1975, Morton started 11 of 12 games at the defensive tackle position for the 1975 Michigan Wolverines football team that played in the 1976 Orange Bowl and finished the season ranked No. 8 in both the AP and UPI polls. Morton compiled 107 tackles and 11 sacks for 58 yards in 1975 and was selected as a first-team All-Big Ten player. In December 1975, the Associated Press published a feature story focusing on Morton's fondness for exotic flora, including a purple passion plant that Morton had named Claudine. The Los Angeles Times dubbed him \\"Michigan's Plant Man.\\" In his final season of collegiate football, Morton started all 12 games at defensive tackle for the 1976 Michigan Wolverines football team that won the Big Ten Conference championship, held opponents to an average of 7.9 points per game, played in the 1977 Rose Bowl and finished the season ranked No. 3 in both the AP and UPI polls.

At the end of his collegiate career, Morton had 268 career tackles.(To retrieve Marsh's statistics, enter \\"Morton\\" in the space for \\"Enter last name\\" and \\"Gregory\\" in the space for \\"Enter first name.\\") He ranked third in Michigan's record book in both career tackles and career tackles for loss. In 1977, Morton received a bachelor of arts degree in history.1977 Michiganensian (University of Michigan yearbook), page 287 (\\"Gregory Morton BA History\\"). Professional football Morton was selected by the Buffalo Bills in the eighth round (197th overall pick) of the 1977 NFL Draft. He appeared in nine games for the Bills during the 1977 NFL season, but he spent much of the season on the bench. In early December 1977, the Bills placed Morton on the inactive list to make room for a third quarterback to be added to the roster. Later years After the 1977 season, Morton opted to return to the University of Michigan to pursue a doctoral degree from the school of education. He subsequently became a probation officer in Fort Worth, Texas. As of 2002, he was also officiating high school football games in the Fort Worth area. In 2001, Morton was inducted into the Summit County Sports Hall of Fame. In 2019, Morton auditioned for the 14th Season of Amerca's Got Talent. He gave an introduction saying that he also did impressions for action figures and was also a PA announcer for a department store. After the intro, he did a few Star Wars impressions. The audience was stunned by a few of them, including when Luke Skywalker's arm got sliced off, R2-D2 & C-3PO, Jabba the Hut, Emperor Palpatine, and finally, Chewbacca, which made the audience stand up on their feet. Judges Howie Mandel, Julianne Hough, Gabrielle Union, and Simon Cowell all voted \\"Yes,\\" sending Greg to the Judge Cuts. Morton's Judge Cuts performance consisted of performing impressions of characters from various movies, like Jurassic Park, E.T., Godfather, Lord of the Rings, Back to the Future, and even Buzz Lightyear from Toy Story. Mandel, Union, Hough, Cowell, and guest judge Ellie Kemper gave him standing ovations. Morton's performance was strong enough to advance to the Quarterfinals along with Marcin Patrzalek on a unanimous verdict. His Quarterfinals performance consisted of performing more impressions of characters from various \\"animated\\" movies, including Lion King, Aladdin, Shrek, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and even Terminator and Heath Ledger's Joker. The judges all gave him yet another standing ovation. He received enough votes to advance to the Semifinals in Episode 1412 along with Messoudi Brothers instead of Bir Khalsa. Finally, Morton's Semifinals performance voices of famous cartoon characters, including Looney Tunes, Flintstones, Shaggy & Scooby-Doo, and Bobby from \\"Bobby's World\\", which surprised Howie Mandel. The four judges and guest judge Sean Hayes gave him a final standing ovation. It was then that Morton did not receive enough votes to advance to the Finals, eliminating him from the competition instead of Kodi Lee.

A 1977 sculpture by Eugenie Gershoy was titled \\"Homage to Audrey McMahon (Goddess of Fertility),\\" in recognition of the over 50,000 works of art produced in New York City during the first few years of the Federal Arts Project.

His work, Stone garden which appears in the Guggenheim currently (2019), draws upon the idea of the Japanese rock garden. His techniques are identified by the Guggenheim: \\"Ohashi was known for paintings that integrated the restrained, purposeful act of collage, adding texture and changing registers of density to large, encompassing abstract forms. He added semitransparent layers of rice paper to the foreground of his paintings and, at times, partly obscured the rice paper with layers of oil paint.

She sat for more of his finished works than any other of his more well-known muses, including Elizabeth Siddall, Jane Morris and Fanny Cornforth. Jiminez, Jill Berk (2001) The Dictionary of Artists' Models (London; Chicago) p. 569. Comparatively little is known about Wilding, while Rossetti's other models, Siddall, Morris and Cornforth, are frequently written about. This is perhaps partly due to the lack of any romantic or sexual connection between the pair, which differentiates Rossetti's relationship with Wilding from those with his other muses. Lee, Jennifer J. (2006) 'Venus Imaginaria: Reflections on Alexa Wilding, Her Life, and Her Role as Muse in the Works of Dante Gabriel Rossetti' (MA thesis, University of Maryland). Biography Early life Alexa Wilding's working-class family originated from Shrewsbury, Shropshire, in England, while Alexa herself (then Alice) was born an only child in Surrey in or about 1847. Her father was a piano-maker, while her father's brothers were butchers. According to the 1861 census, when she was 14, Wilding was living at 23 Warwick Lane near Newgate Market in London with her 59-year-old grandmother, two uncles and a cousin. She was a working girl, but her standard of life is not thought to have been terrible for the time, and she could read and write. By the time of her association with Rossetti, she was living with an aunt and working as a dressmaker with ambitions of becoming an actress. Period with Rossetti Wilding was first seen by Rossetti in 1865, when she was walking one evening along the Strand. He was immediately impressed by her beauty. She agreed to sit for him the following day for a proposed painting of Aspecta Medusa, but failed to arrive as planned; it is possible that she was put off by the morally dubious reputation of models at that time. Weeks went by, and Rossetti had given up the idea of the painting he had in mind, so important did he consider the look of this specific model to it, when he spotted her again in the street. He jumped from the cab he was in and persuaded her to be led straight back to his studio. He paid her a weekly fee to sit for him exclusively, afraid that other artists might also employ her. Dunn, Henry Treffry, ed. Rosalie Glynn Grylls Mander (1984) Recollections of Dante Gabriel Rossetti and his circle (Westerham) p. 46. The two shared a lasting bond; after Rossetti's death in 1882, Wilding, though not particularly financially well off, was said to have travelled to place a wreath on his grave in Birchington-on-Sea. Spencer-Longhurst, Paul (2000) The Blue Bower: Rossetti in the 1860s (London). In the 1881 census, Alice Wilding, aged 34, was living at 33 Redcliffe Road, Kensington, with her two young children, Charles and Nellie Wilding. Charles James Ernest Wilding was born in Hammersmith on 23 June 1876. Eleanor Wilding was born on 3 September 1877, also in Hammersmith. The identity of their father is not known.Rossetti, Dante, ed. Fredeman, William (2006) The Correspondence of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Volume 6 (Brewer). By this time Alexa held a position as a landlady and property-holder, a considerable achievement for a working-class woman. In his letters to Dunn from 1873, Rossetti complains about Wilding's housing situation, since he seems often to have been called upon to lend her money towards it; \\"Surely A.W. will now get rid of this mad house of hers.\\" Lee (2006) pp. 41‚Äì2. Death The death certificate issued for Alexa Wilding records her death on 25 April 1884, aged 37. The cause of death was peritonitis for six days and eventual exhaustion; sixteen months earlier she had been diagnosed with a splenic tumor. This may be the disease that had previously caused Rossetti to think her ill, and prevented her sometimes from keeping her sittings. Lee (2006) p. 43. She is buried in Brompton Cemetery, along with her grandmother, Mary Ann, and niece, Marie. While her death certificate states the date of her death as 25 April, her tombstone lists it as 24 April 1884. Lee, Jennifer (2008) ‚Ä≤The Forgotten Muse: Alexa Wilding‚Ä≤, The Pre-Raphaelite Society Newsletter of the United States, Number 19, Spring 2008. In Rossetti's art In Rossetti's paintings, Wilding's elegant looks and ethereal beauty were in contrast to another of Rossetti's models, the voluptuous Fanny Cornforth. Wilding's more refined features were substituted for Cornforth's in Lady Lilith (1864‚Äì1868), in part when Rossetti's patron and owner of the painting Frederick Leyland considered the original too earthy. Spencer-Longhurst. Similarly, the painting Venus Verticordia (1864‚Äì1868), originally modelled by a near six-foot-tall cook, Surtees, Virginia (1971) The Paintings and Drawings of Dante Gabriel Rossetti: A Catalogue Raisonn√© (Oxford) p. 99. was repainted with Wilding's face in January 1868. Rossetti seems to have considered her features versatile enough for the roles of both virtue, for example Sibylla Palmifera, and vice, as in the paintings mentioned here, in roles previously reserved for Cornforth. Lee (2006) p. 17. Contemporaries seem to have disagreed over Wilding's capacity for expression: Rossetti's assistant, Henry Treffry Dunn said of her that she was \\"... without any variety of expression. She sat like a Sphinx, waiting to be questioned, and with always a vague reply in return... But she had a deep well of affection within her seemingly placid exterior.\\" The artist's brother, William Michael Rossetti, meanwhile saw her as \\"capable of much varying expression.\\" Dunn described Wilding as having \\"a lovely face, beautifully moulded in every feature, full of quiescent, soft, mystical repose that suited some of his conceptions admirably... He was struck with her beautiful face and golden, auburn hair. It was the very type of face he had been seeking so long.\\" Spencer-Longhurst. Wilding's features are easy to spot in Rossetti's art; the red hair, long neck, perfect Cupid's bow lips, and somewhat softer eyes compared to Lizzie Siddall's famed heavy-lidded ones. However, in The Blessed Damozel, Wilding's features are less discernible thanks to Rossetti's portrayal of her with his late wife's eyes. Additionally two of Rossetti's paintings featuring Wilding are similar to those originally modelled for by his late wife Lizzie Siddall, Regina Cordium and Damsel of the Sanct Grael. Lee (2006) pp. 22‚Äì23. According to his close friend, the art critic Frederic George Stephens, \\"nothing he drew of her, diverse as the delineations were, seemed less than an exact likeness.\\" Paintings of Alexa Wilding Those by Rossetti include: * Monna Vanna (1866) * Regina Cordium (1866); a revisit to the subject of his 1860 Regina Cordium, which had been modelled by his wife Elizabeth Siddall. * Sibylla Palmifera (1866‚Äì1870) * Venus Verticordia (repainted 1867-1868; originally 1864‚Äì1866), repainted with Wilding's face when it failed to sell; modelled originally by a cook whom he noticed in the street, \\"a very large young woman, almost a giantess\\".Surtees, p. 99. * Dante's Dream at the Time of the Death of Beatrice (1871), far left. * The Bower Meadow (1871‚Äì1872) * Veronica Veronese (1872) * Lady Lilith (repainted 1872-1873; originally 1864‚Äì1868), modelled originally by Fanny Cornforth (cf. this watercolour copy), but repainted with Wilding's face. * La Ghirlandata (1873) *The Beloved (retouched in 1873; originally 1863), modelled originally by Marie Ford, is also thought to be inspired by Wilding when retouched. * Damsel of the Sanct Grael (1874) * Roman Widow (1874) * La Bella Mano (1875) * A Sea-Spell (1875-1877) * The Blessed Damozel (1875‚Äì1878); shows the influence of his next muse Jane Morris's hooded eyes.

Calapai's work can be found in the Fogg Art Museum and in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts which is where Calapai's parents took him when he was a boy. Biography Letterio Calapai made for himself a fruitful artistic career that spanned well over fifty years, during which he was deemed \\"a printmaker for the twentieth century\\" by the Chicago Sun-Times in 1984. The son of Sicilian immigrants, Calapai was born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts. Although the Calapai family was not monetarily wealthy, their lives were \\"rich in the pleasures of music, poetry, and art.\\" Both the artist's mother and father made every effort to expose their son to the arts; his father recited poetry, his mother played the piano, and together they provided Calapai with violin lessons. During his childhood, Calapai frequented the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge. There, his exposure to the work of the Old Masters would come to have a profound influence on his art; as he later declared, \\"their realism was my goal‚Ä¶\\" John Taylor Arms recognized the artist's unique appreciation for the Old Masters and said of Calapai, \\"He wants to study the great men. Very often the artist just wants to study his own ability.\\" Calapai's interest in art continued to flourish at East Boston High School where he earned impressive grades and exhibited great artistic talent, particularly at drawing. His high school art history teacher, recognizing his notable artistic skill, gave him a paint box and brushes as a graduation present. Calapai recalled that \\"this wonderful gift was a tangible sign that I really did have some talent. It was the inspiration that led to the beginning of my career as an artist.\\" Calapai embarked upon this career at the Massachusetts Normal Art School (today known as the Massachusetts College of Art) where he turned his attention to painting. He received a two-year scholarship to the School of Fine Arts and Crafts in Boston after proving his exceptional artistic ability with several oil paintings. Under the instruction of Charles Hopkinson, Calapai excelled in figure painting and planned to enter a competition to study in Florence, Italy. Sadly, a devastating fire erupted in the summer of 1928 and destroyed all of his work, without which he would not be able to enter the contest. Disillusioned by the loss, Calapai believed, \\"Boston had little to offer in advancing my career.\\" Encouraged by his pianist cousin, Vincent Aita, Calapai relocated to New York City. For seven years he worked at a lithographic office while continuing drawing classes at the Art Students League and sculpture classes at the Beaux Arts Institute of Design. To the great dismay of his former teacher, Charles Hopkinson, Calapai devoted little time to producing his own artwork. Thus, Hopkinson offered to help Calapai financially, so that he could spend more time advancing his artistic career. Subsequently, Calapai immersed himself in his art, and the outcome of this effort was recognized in his first one-man show at the Montross Gallery, New York in 1934. Calapai attributed the success of the exhibition to Hopkinson's \\"interest and financial support.\\" In the years following 1934, Calapai expanded his artistic repertoire to include printmaking, a media that was deemed \\"limited\\" in previous years. He explored wood engraving, developing religious and literary themes. He often used the words of such authors as William Carlos Williams and Thomas Wolfe in his artwork. His religious depictions were described as \\"cataclysmic‚Ä¶scenes, emotional in color, form and design\\" by Stuart Preston, an art critic for The New York Times. \\"Harvest\\", a 1945 print, exemplified Calapai's interest in scenes of society's progress in both rural and urban landscapes. In 1946, Calapai began to explore the abstract realm of printmaking, primarily as a result of his exposure to Stanley William Hayter's workshop, Atelier 17. At this intaglio workshop, Calapai mastered and adopted unique metal engraving techniques. Hayter referred to his admirer as a \\"leader in the new ways.\\" 11:45 P.M. (1947) demonstrated Calapai's newfound influence, utilizing Hayter's theory of \\"space visualized through lines in space of infinite dimensionality.\\" His images continued further into abstraction, as he became interested in Social Realists, German Expressionism, and Post- Expressionism. Such ideas were seen in Jehovah's Eye, Empyrean, and La Valse, which demonstrated his increasingly fantastical and imaginative approach to his subject matter. Calapai, \\"constantly inspired by nature,\\" experimented with organic, circular shapes and color. He successfully evoked the images of an imaginary underwater world through his blue and black intaglio prints, including Arioso Dolente and de Profundis, both from 1952. While Calapai absorbed new ideas from established artists and movements, he simultaneously imparted his knowledge to promising young artists. In addition to working as a printmaker, Calapai dedicated himself to teaching art. He founded and chaired the Graphic Arts Department of the Albright Art School in Buffalo, NY (1949-1955), then taught art at the New School for Social Research (1955-1965). He also established the Intaglio Workshop for Advanced Printmaking in New York (1962‚Äì65) and worked at numerous other colleges and universities. The creative relationship between teacher and student was an important catalyst in Calapai's career; Calapai found a \\"great reward in following the eminent careers of many students who still keep in touch‚Ä¶ and occasionally ask advice about technical matters.\\" Letterio Calapai continued to explore the technical and aesthetic aspects of all artwork in his studio in Glencoe, Illinois while maintaining the tradition of teaching through his workshop. In 1962, Calapai wed Jean Hillard, to whom he attributes his \\"modest success\\". He describes her as a \\"rare and devoted wife.\\" Letterio Calapai died on March 29, 1993, his 91st birthday, after a private concert given to him by Vladimir Leytchkiss. Leytchkiss performed music by Franz Schubert, a man Calapai had previously illustrated in his artwork. His wife, Jean, remembers this time as \\"a celebration of a beautiful life. There was very little pain‚Ä¶\\" No commemorative show was planned, as Jean explained \\"Letterio always said, 'My work is my memorial.'\\"Compiled by Laura Conover and Allie Reilly Legacy Calapai's work can be found in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art; Biblioth√®que nationale de France; Art Institute of Chicago; Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; Baltimore Art Museum; Davis Museum and Cultural Center, Wellesley College; Syracuse University Art Galleries; Palmer Museum at Pennsylvania State University; Flint Institute of Arts, and Brauer Museum, Valparaiso (http://www.valpo.edu/brauer-museum-of-art/).

For instance, shadow banned comments posted to a blog or media website will not be visible to other persons accessing that site from their computers. By partly concealing, or making a user's contributions invisible or less prominent to other members of the service, the hope may be that in the absence of reactions to their comments, the problematic or otherwise out-of-favour user will become bored or frustrated and leave the site, and that spammers and trolls will not create new accounts.  Notable examples  In the mid-1980s, BBS forums including Citadel BBS software had a \\"twit bit\\" for problematic users. When enabled, the user would have limited access, and commonly still be able to read public discussions; however, any messages posted by that \\"twit\\" would not be shown to the other users of that group. Michael Pryor of Fog Creek Software described stealth banning for online forums in 2006, saying how such a system was in place in the project management system FogBugz, \\"to solve the problem of how do you get the person to go away and leave you alone\\". As well as preventing problem users from engaging in flame wars, the system also discouraged spammers, who if they returned to the site would be under the false impression that their spam was still in place. The Verge describes it as \\"one of the oldest moderation tricks in the book\\", noting that early versions of vBulletin had a global ignore list known as \\"Tachy goes to Coventry\\", as in the British expression \\"to send someone to Coventry\\", meaning to ignore them and pretend they do not exist. A 2012 update to Hacker News introduced a system of \\"hellbanning\\" for spamming and abusive behavior. Craigslist has also been known to \\"ghost\\" a user's individual ads, whereby the poster gets a confirmation email and may view the ad in their account, but the ad fails to show up in the appropriate category page. Early on, Reddit implemented a similar feature, initially designed to address spam accounts. In 2015, Reddit added an account suspension feature. WeChat was found in 2016 to ban posts and messages that contain certain keywords without notice. In a study that looked at tweets from 2014 to early 2015, over a quarter million tweets were found during the one-year period in Turkey to have been censored via shadow banning. Twitter was also found, in 2015, to shadowban tweets containing leaked documents in the US. The phenomenon was noticed on Instagram in 2017, when certain posts are prevented from being discovered in hashtag searches of the tags included in the posts. \\"Shadow banning\\" became popularized in 2018 as a conspiracy theory that Twitter had shadow-banned Republicans. In late July 2018, Vice News found that several supporters of the US Republican Party no longer appeared in the auto- populated drop-down search menu on Twitter, thus limiting their visibility when being searched for; Vice News alleged that this was a case of shadow- banning. After the story, some conservatives accused Twitter of enacting a shadowban on Republican accounts, a claim which Twitter denied. However, some accounts that were not overtly political or conservative apparently had the same algorithm applied to them. Numerous news outlets, including The New York Times, The Guardian, Buzzfeed News, Engadget and New York magazine, disputed the Vice News story. In a blog post, Twitter said that the use of the phrase \\"shadow banning\\" was inaccurate, as the tweets were still visible by navigating to the home page of the relevant account. Later, Twitter appeared to have adjusted its platform to no longer limit the visibility of some accounts.

Agnew joined the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago in 1942, and helped build Chicago Pile-1, the world's first nuclear reactor. In 1943, he joined the Los Alamos Laboratory, where he worked with the Cockcroft‚ÄìWalton generator. After the war ended, he returned to the University of Chicago, where he completed his graduate work under Enrico Fermi. Agnew returned to Los Alamos in 1949, and worked on the Castle Bravo nuclear test at Bikini Atoll in 1954. He became head of the Weapon Nuclear Engineering Division in 1964. He also served as a Democratic New Mexico State Senator from 1955 to 1961, and was the Scientific Adviser to the NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) from 1961 to 1964.

After the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor brought the United States into the Pacific War, Agnew and his girlfriend Beverly, a fellow graduate of South Denver High School and the University of Denver, attempted to join the United States Army Air Corps together. They were persuaded not to sign the enlistment papers. Instead, Joyce C. Stearns, the head of the physics department at the University of Denver, persuaded Agnew to come with him to the University of Chicago, where Stearns became the deputy head of the Metallurgical Laboratory. Although Agnew had enough credits to graduate, Beverly did not and had to remain behind. They were married in Denver on May 2, 1942. They then went to Chicago, where Beverly became a secretary to Richard L. Doan, then head of the Metallurgical Laboratory. Agnew and Beverly had two children, a daughter Nancy, and a son, John. Harold Agnew on Tinian in 1945, carrying the plutonium core of the Nagasaki Fat Man bomb At the Metallurgical Laboratory, Agnew worked with Enrico Fermi, Walter Zinn and Herbert L. Anderson. There, he was involved in the construction of Chicago Pile-1. Initially, Agnew worked with the instrumentation. The Geiger counters were calibrated using a radon-beryllium source, and Agnew received too high a dose of radiation. He was then put to work stacking the graphite bricks that were the reactor's neutron moderator. He witnessed the first controlled nuclear chain reaction when the reactor went critical on December 2, 1942. Agnew and Beverly moved to the Los Alamos Laboratory in March 1943. Agnew, Beverly and Bernard Waldman first went to the University of Illinois, where the men disassembled the Cockcroft‚ÄìWalton generator and particle accelerator while Beverly catalogued all the parts. The parts were shipped to New Mexico, where Agnew and Beverly met up with them, and rode the trucks hauling them to the Los Alamos Laboratory. There, Beverly worked as a secretary, initially with Robert Oppenheimer and his secretary Priscilla Green. She then became secretary to Robert Bacher, the head of Physics (P) Division, and later the Gadget (G) Division, for the rest of the war. Agnew's job was to reassemble the accelerator, which was then used for experiments by John Manley's group. { +Los Alamos ID badges align=centerHarold M. Agnew Harold M. Agnew align=centerBeverly J. Agnew Beverly J. Agnew } When experimental work wound down, Agnew was transferred to Project Alberta, working as part of Luis W. Alvarez's group, whose role was to monitor the yield of nuclear explosions. With Alvarez and Lawrence H. Johnston, Agnew had devised a method for measuring the yield of the nuclear blast by dropping pressure gauges on parachutes and telemetering the readings back to the plane. In June 1945, he was issued an Army uniform and dog tags at Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, and was flown to Tinian in the Western Pacific in a C-54 of the 509th Composite Group. Agnew's first task was to install his yield measurement instrumentation in the Boeing B-29 Superfortress aircraft The Great Artiste. During the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, on August 6, 1945, Agnew, along with Alvarez and Johnston, flew as a scientific observer in The Great Artiste, piloted by Charles Sweeney, which tailed the Enola Gay as the instrumentation aircraft. Agnew later recalled, \\"After we dropped our gauges I remember we made a sharp turn to the right so that we would not get caught in the blast ‚Äì but we still got badly shaken up by it.\\" He brought along a movie camera and took the only existing movies of the Hiroshima event as seen from the air. After the war ended, Agnew entered the University of Chicago, where he completed his graduate work under Fermi. Agnew and Beverly stayed with Fermi and his family, due to the post-war housing shortage. He received his Master of Science (MS) degree in 1948 and his Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in 1949, writing his thesis on \\"The beta-spectra of Cs137, Y91, Pm147, Ru106, Sm151, P32, Tm170\\". Fellow postgraduate students at Chicago at the time included Tsung-Dao Lee, Chen Ning Yang, Owen Chamberlain and Jack Steinberger. Los Alamos years Harold Agnew receives his 30 years of service award in 1974 With his doctorate in hand, Agnew returned to Los Alamos as a National Research Foundation Fellow, and worked on weapons development in the Physics Division. In 1950, he was assigned to the thermonuclear weapons project, and was project engineer for the Castle Bravo nuclear test at Bikini Atoll in 1954. He became head of the Weapon Nuclear Engineering Division in 1964. Agnew served as a Democratic New Mexico State Senator from 1955 to 1961. He was the first state senator to be elected from Los Alamos County. Senators served unpaid, receiving only a per diem allowance of five dollars. Since the New Mexico legislature convened for only 30 days in even numbered years and 60 days in odd numbered years, he was able to continue working at Los Alamos, taking leave without pay to attend. He attempted to reform New Mexico's liquor laws, which specified a minimum mark-up. He was unsuccessful in 1957, but the law was reformed in 1963. From 1961 to 1964, he was Scientific Adviser to the NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR). He also held a number of part- time advisory position with the military over the years. He was a member of the United States Air Force Scientific Advisory Board from 1957 to 1968, and was chairman of the Science Advisory Group of the United States Army's Combat Development Command from 1966 to 1970. He was a member of the Defense Science Board from 1966 to 1970, the Army's Scientific Advisory Panel from 1966 to 1974, and the Army Science Board from 1978 to 1984. Agnew became director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1970, when it had 7,000 employees. He took over at a time of great change. His predecessor, Norris Bradbury, had rebuilt the laboratory from scratch after the war, and many of the people he had brought in were approaching retirement. Under his directorship, Los Alamos developed an underground test containment program, completed its Meson Physics Facility, acquired the first Cray supercomputer, and trained the first class of International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors. Agnew managed to get the Los Alamos Laboratory responsibility for the development of the W76, used by the Trident I and Trident II Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles, and the W78 used by the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles. He was proud of the work with insensitive high explosive that made nuclear weapons safer to handle. Support from the Atomic Energy Commission for reactor development dried up, but during the 1970s energy crisis, the laboratory explored other types of alternative fuels. Later life In 1979, Agnew resigned from Los Alamos and became President and Chief Executive Officer of General Atomics, a position he held until 1985. In his letter of resignation to David S. Saxon, the President of the University of California, Agnew wrote that his decision was influenced by \\"dissatisfaction with University administration policies and a lack of advocacy for the total LASL [Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory] program\\" and \\"frustration with what I consider to be a continuing inequitable distribution of defense program funding by the Department of Energy between the LASL and LLL [Lawrence Livermore Laboratory].\\" Harold Agnew at The Los Alamos Laboratory in 2006 Agnew chaired the General Advisory Committee of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency from 1974 to 1978, and served as a White House science councillor from 1982 to 1989. He was a member of NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel from 1968 to 1974, and from 1978 to 1987. He became an adjunct professor at the University of California, San Diego in 1988. He was the recipient of the E.O. Lawrence Award in 1966, and of the Department of Energy's Enrico Fermi Award in 1978. Along with Hans Bethe, Agnew was the first to receive the Los Alamos National Laboratory Medal. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering. A proponent of tactical nuclear weapons, Agnew pointed out in 1970 that the Thanh Hoa Bridge in Vietnam required hundreds of sorties to destroy with conventional weapons when a nuclear weapon could have done the job with just one. In a 1977 article for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Agnew argued that the fusion reactions of neutron bombs could provide \\"tactical\\" advantages over conventional fission weapons, especially in countering the \\"massive armor component possessed by the Eastern bloc.\\" Citing conclusions reached by the Rand Corporation, Agnew argued that without affecting the armor of a tank, the neutrons produced by a fusion blast would penetrate the vehicle and \\"in a matter of a few tens of minutes to hours kill or make the crew completely ineffective.\\" Because the neutron bomb reduced collateral damage, it could be used in a much more selective fashion than a fission weapon, thereby providing a clear \\"advantage for the military defender as well as for the nearby non-combatant.\\" Agnew maintained that no new U.S. nuclear weapon design could be certified without nuclear testing, and that stockpile reliability stewardship without such testing may be problematic. In a 1999 letter to the Wall Street Journal, he commented on the significance of allegations of Chinese nuclear espionage. \\"As long as any nation has a demonstrated nuclear capability and a means of delivering its bombs and warheads, it doesn't really matter whether the warheads are a little smaller or painted a color other than red, white, and blue,\\" he wrote. \\"I suspect information published in the open by the National [sic.] Resources Defense Council has been as useful to other nations as any computer codes they may have received by illegal means.\\" Beverly died on October 11, 2011. Agnew was diagnosed of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and died at his home in Solana Beach, California, on September 29, 2013, while watching football on television. He was survived by his daughter Nancy and son John. He had arranged to be cremated and his ashes interred with Beverly's at the Guaje Pines Cemetery in Los Alamos. In a 2005 BBC interview, Agnew stated, \\"About three-quarters of the U.S. nuclear arsenal was designed under my tutelage at Los Alamos. That is my legacy.\\" Notes References External links *1994 Audio Interview with Harold Agnew by Richard Rhodes Voices of the Manhattan Project *1992 Video Interview with Harold Agnew by Theresa Strottman Voices of the Manhattan Project *Register of the Harold Melvin Agnew motion picture film at the Hoover Institution Archives, Stanford University 1921 births 2013 deaths American physicists Enrico Fermi Award recipients Los Alamos National Laboratory personnel Manhattan Project people People from Denver People associated with the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences Members of the United States National Academy of Engineering University of Denver alumni University of Chicago alumni United States Army Science Board people Fellows of the American Physical Society ","title":"Harold Agnew"},{"id":"34092783","text":"√Ångel Cabrera Izquierdo (born August 5, 1967) is the President of the Georgia Institute of Technology.

This lichen has a large thallus that may exceed one meter in width. It is divided into lobes up to about 10 centimeters long and 6 wide. It is green, becoming pale as it dries. The thallus is dotted with cephalodia, which contains one of the two symbionts, a species of Nostoc. The other is a species of Coccomyxa. These perform photosynthesis, and the Nostoc also fixes nitrogen. The lichen produces large apothecia, a reproductive structure. This widespread lichen grows in a variety of habitat types, including Arctic ecosystems. It grows in alpine climates in the southern parts of its distribution. This lichen was noted to absorb aluminum and silicon from the ash released from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.

She is currently Alumni Distinguished Undergraduate Professor of Psychology at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, North Carolina, and is an editor of the journal Social Development. She developed questionnaires on emotional expression in the family that are used internationally to address a wide variety of social developmental questions. To date she has authored or co-authored more than forty articles and book chapters and two readers for graduate and undergraduate courses in social psychology. Her research has been presented at national and international conferences including the Society for Research in Child Development, the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, the Association for Psychological Science and the International Society for Research on Emotion. She has been awarded several research grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Science Foundation (NSF) and is currently working on a NSF-funded project examining children's understanding of emotion in the family.  Life  Amy Halberstadt was born on December 28, 1954, in Brooklyn, New York. Her father was an engineer and management consultant and her mother a small businessperson. She grew up in New Hyde Park, New York, attended Colgate University for her BS in 1976 (PBK, 1975) and The Johns Hopkins University as a graduate student, where she earned her PhD in 1981 working with Professor Judith Hall. From high school through her early professional life she was also a competitive fencer and fencing coach, placing 6th in women's foil at the 1985 Empire State Games in Buffalo, New York. Halberstadt and her husband Anthony Weston have two children and are active in urban agriculture in Durham, North Carolina.  Expressiveness and social power/dominance  Halberstadt's work on family emotional expressiveness, begun in her doctoral dissertation under the supervision of Professor Judith Hall, is now widely cited and utilized in research on socialization of emotion and nonverbal communication. She has demonstrated contrasting relationships of family expressiveness to nonverbal skills (sending and decoding of emotional expression) and shown, with various colleagues, that family expressiveness styles influence individuals' expressiveness, emotional experience, and understanding of others' emotional experiences. The Family Expressiveness Questionnaire (FEQ) and the Self-Expressiveness in the Family Questionnaire are tools used in the service of this research. With Judy Hall, Halberstadt helped establish social psychology's interest in understanding the relation of hierarchy-related variables, such as personality dominance and actual or perceived social power, to nonverbal communication.  Affective social competence  Halberstadt's key contribution to the field of social development is an integrated conceptualization of emotional communication skills, a concept she labelled Affective Social Competence (ASC).; ; Michelle Shiota and James Kalat, Emotion (Cengage, second edition, 2011), pp. 00. ASC includes three components: sending one's own emotional messages, receiving others' emotional messages, and experiencing emotions. Within each component are four developmental skills: becoming aware of an emotion, identifying what that emotion is, working within the social context, and regulating emotion to meet short-term and long-term goals.. The conceptualization is dynamic, to reflect the moment-to-moment changes inherent in social interactions. Halberstadt and colleagues also consider how individual characteristics, such as temperament and self-concept, and environmental contexts, such as culture and historical change, may alter how ASC components operate. The ASC construct has been used by researchers in clinical psychology,. developmental psychology,.. and family science..  Ongoing and new projects  Recognizing that parental beliefs may influence parents‚Äô emotion socialization behaviors and child outcomes and that these beliefs might vary across cultures, Halberstadt and Professors Julie Dunsmore (Department of Psychology, Virginia Tech) and Al Bryant (School of Education, UNC-Pembroke) received funding to explore the varied beliefs about emotions that parents from African American, European American, and Lumbee American Indian cultural groups hold. One goal was to develop a questionnaire to assess parents‚Äô beliefs about children's emotion (PBACE) by using a multi-ethnic, multi-class questionnaire development process, which involved over 1000 parents. Multiple studies have utilized previous versions of the PBACE in an attempt to further understand the influence of parents‚Äô beliefs about emotions on parenting behaviors and children's outcomes, including parental emotional reactions and discussion of emotion, and children's attachment, emotion understanding, ability to cope with stress, and sense of self...... Halberstadt's recent interests include the intersections of race, culture, class, and gender in the socialization of emotion, while continuing to explore the role of parental beliefs about emotion in children's emotion development... Currently she is collaborating with Dr. Patricia Garrett-Peters of the Frank Porter Graham Child Development Institute at UNC-Chapel Hill on a project funded by NSF investigating the multi-dimensionality of emotion understanding in middle childhood, as well as links between mothers' beliefs about emotions, parenting, maternal emotion socialization practices, children's emotion understanding, and social competence at school. Other current research focuses on particular emotions, such as anger, pride, and jealousy; affective social competence in general; the social construction of gender; and a variety of cultural factors.

Edited by Thomas G. Plante and Allen C. Sherman, the book was published in the United States in 2001. The book includes 16 chapters divided among four major parts that focus on general population outcomes (such as impacts on longevity), outcomes in special populations such as medical patients or adolescents, clinical implications, and overall criticisms and reflections. Faith and Health has been reviewed in several professional journals, including Contemporary Psychology, Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, and others. Topics Covered Faith and Health contains 16 chapters written by various psychological or biomedical researchers, and some of them are notable. Chapter titles and authors are listed in the table (below, at right). After an introductory chapter, the remaining 15 chapters are divided into four major parts. The book's first part focuses on the faith/health relation in the general population. Chapter 2 by Carl E. Thoresen and his colleagues describes the existing empirical evidence, and discusses many methodological issues. The authors view the evidence as indicating that religious/spiritual factors \\"appear to be associated with physical, mental, and overall health, but the lack of adequate controls and designs in many studies has seriously limited our understanding of these relationships.\\"Chapter 2, Thoresen, Harris & Oman The authors also note methodological challenges related to the need for more studies that follow participants over time, rather than observing them only once; the need to recognize that if religion and spirituality operate through other factors, they may be very influential but remain unrecognized, because they do not explain unique variance; and the need for more experimental studies. The authors also present a \\"working model... that tries to capture several factors that may be involved in the pathways connecting [religious/spiritual] factors with health,\\" and highlight four studies that investigated religion/spirituality and health relationships using \\"state-of- the-art epidemiological designs\\" { width=\\"50%\\" style=\\"float: right; border: 1px solid darkgray; margin: .46em; font-size: 80%;\\" border=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" -valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"10\\"  width=\\"200\\" align=\\"center\\" Chapter Title width=\\"150\\" align=\\"center\\" Author(s) -valign=\\"top\\" 1.

Conclusions and future directions for research on faith and health Allen C. Sherman & Thomas G.

McCullough describes results of a meta- analysisMcCullough (pp. 58, 73) cites this meta-analytic research to of 42 independent estimates of the association between religious involvement and length of life, reporting that \\"religious people had, on average, 29% higher odds of survival during any follow-up period than did less religious people\\"Chapter 3, McCullough Other chapters looked at religion and health in late adulthood, and at the role of forgiveness and unforgiveness. A final chapter discussed how religiousness and spirituality is assessed in health research. The second part focuses on faith and health in special populations. These include adolescents who are at risk for abusing tobacco and alcohol, as well as survivors and sufferer from cancer and HIV/AIDS. The section also discusses how religious faith is related to mental health outcomes, such as well-being, depression, anxiety, substance abuse, eating disorders, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorders. It concluded that \\"Most research examining the relationship between religion and spirituality and mental health outcomes shows positive associations.\\"Chapter 10 Plante & Sharma Part three addresses implications of the faith/health relationships for the clinic. Chapters discuss implications for psychotherapy, rehabilitation medicine. A chapter by Tan and Dong offers dangers and guidelines for implementing spiritually-informed interventions that may include components such as meditation, forgiveness, prayer, solitude, the laying on of hands, fellowship, and worship, observing that \\"as health care providers implement religiously or spiritually oriented interventions, it is crucial that they do so with the utmost ethical caution and professional care.\\"Chapter 12, Tan and Dong The fourth part contains commentaries on the previous chapters and on the literature. Timothy Smith wrote that \\"it is clear that matters of religion and spirituality are relevant to each of the foci of health psychology... [and] the emergence of this topic [of faith and health] seems long overdue.\\"Chapter 15, Smith He also cautioned that many results are \\"preliminary.\\" A chapter by Richard Sloan and his colleagues argued that no compelling evidence links religion and health, and that \\"concerns of patients about religion and health are best addressed by clergy, to whom referrals can readily be made.\\"Chapter 14, Sloan, Bagiella & Powell A concluding chapter by the editors argued that > The interface between religion, spirituality, and health is an > extraordinarily rich area for scientific investigation. For many, a concern > with the sacred or transcendent goes to the heart of what it means to be > human.

Reviews and influence Reviews have appeared in Contemporary Psychology, the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, Families, Systems, & Health, and the Journal of Health Psychology. In Contemporary Psychology, Richards and O'Grady wrote that \\"Faith and Health takes us well beyond Freud's, Watson's, Skinner's, and Ellis's oversimplified, negative views of religion and spirituality... [and] sets a high standard of methodological rigor, openness, and balance.\\" In the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, Boehnlein wrote that the editors' \\"primary focus, and stated goal, is to assess what is known about the relationship between health outcomes and faith [and they] are largely successful in achieving this goal. \\" He also wrote that because it reviews so much quantitative research, the book is geared more towards researchers than towards clinicians, although there are a few chapters devoted to psychotherapy and rehabilitation. In Families, Systems, & Health, King wrote that their \\"numerous publications\\" attest to the editors' expertise in faith/health relations, and that the book is a \\"comprehensive look at research.\\" He wrote that he found \\"the book very useful and will use it in both my practice and teaching... I plan to add a section on couples and health to my couples therapy class ‚Äî an omission I recognized upon reading this informative book.\\" In the Journal of Health Psychology, Martin wrote that the book was \\"an unusually cohesive collection of chapters that reviews current research endeavors, recent findings and critical controversies in this rapidly changing field,\\" and would make a \\"very nice text for a graduate-level seminar.\\" Three \\"admirable\\" strengths include representative contributions by top researchers, a section on clinical application, and two solid methodological critiques that \\"lay out a framework for addressing problems that, left dormant, would fatally harm the discipline.\\" Martin stated that one weakness was a lack of clear delineation of how definitions of spirituality and religion in particular chapters \\"overlap (or fail to) with similar definitions\\" of the constructs in other chapters. Another weakness was a lack of large-scale theoretical frameworks, although two chapters (2 and 5) provide \\"insightful discussion and examples of how [theoretical modeling] might be approached.\\" The published book also contained praise for the book by Norman Anderson, Kenneth I.

It is part of the \\"unfinished\\" series of Prigioni intended for the Tomb of Julius II.  History  It seems that from the first version of the tomb of Julius II (1505) a series of \\"Prigioni\\" was planned for the lowest level of the mausoleum ‚Äì a series of more-than-life-size statues of chained figures in various poses, leaning on the pilasters which framed a set of niches, each of which would contain a \\"winged Victory\\". With one on each side of each niche, it must have been initially intended for there to be sixteen or twenty Prigioni. In the course of the reductions of the project which followed, this was reduced to twelve (second project, 1513), eight (third project, 1516) and finally perhaps a mere four (fourth or fifth version, 1526 or 1532), before they were completely eliminated from the project in 1542. According to de Tolnay (1951, 1954) the Young Slave was intended for the space left of the central niche in the project of 1516. The first examples of the series are the two Prigioni of Paris, which are mentioned in Michelangelo's letters and were named the \\"Slaves\\" (Schiavi) in the 19th century: the Dying Slave and the Rebellious Slave. They were sculpted in Rome around 1513. The Florentine Prigioni (The Young Slave, the Bearded Slave, the Atlas Slave, and the Awakening Slave) were probably sculpted in the latter half of the 1520s, when Michelangelo was employed at San Lorenzo in Florence (but historians have suggested dates between 1519 and 1534). They are known to have been in the artist's store on the via Mozza until 1544, when Michelangelo's nephew, Leonardo Buonarroti, asked for permission to sell them (Michelangelo did not set foot in Florence after 1534). This permission was denied and it was only in 1564 that they were sold, along with The Genius of Victory to the Grand Duke Cosimo I, who placed them in the four corners of the Grotto of Buontalenti before 1591. They were removed from there in 1908 to join the Michelangelo collection which had been formed in the Florentine gallery. Regarding the date of their creation, Justi (and others) have proposed 1519 on the basis of a letter of 13 February in which Jacopo Salviati assured the cardinal Aginesis, heir of Pope Julius II that the sculptor would have produced four figures for the tomb before the summer of that year. Wilde proposed 1523, because there is a reference to the cardinal Giulio de' Medici (the future Clement VII) having seen them before he left for Rome on that date. However de Tolnay dated them to 1530‚Äì1534, based on stylistic factors, the frequent mentions of unfinished sculptures for the tomb of Pope Julius in Michelangelo's letters of 1531‚Äì1532 and because Vasari mentions that they were made while Michelangelo prepared the cartoon of The Last Judgment. A wax bozzetto of the work at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London is generally considered to have been made by Michelangelo himself.  Description and style  The Young Slave has slightly bent knees as if bearing an enormous force bearing down his back. His left arm is raised to cover his face and his right arm is behind his back, held by a chain which is not visible. The figure is among the most complete of the group and shows clear definition in his legs, torso (especially on the left hand side) and his arms. His hands and head are less worked, while the back is completely unsculpted. The whole surface gives clear traces of the chisels and scrapers used in the sculpting process. Because of its unfinished state it has an extraordinary energy (already noted by Bocchi in 1591), which connects the figure to some kind of primordial act of liberation from its prison of crude stone ‚Äì an epic battle with chaos. The meaning of the Prigioni was probably linked to the motif of the Captivi in Roman art. In fact, Vasari identifies them as personifications of the provinces controlled by Julius II. For Condivi, however, they symbolised the Arts, turned into \\"prisoners\\" after the Pope's death. Other scholars have made suggested philosophical-symbolic meanings or links to the personal life of the artist and his \\"torments\\".

It influenced various budding artists intent on depicting Harlem and led to the formation of the Harlem Arts Alliance. It became a countrywide exemplar for others, notably the South Side Community Art Center in Chicago.  History  Students at the Harlem Community Art Center (January 1, 1938) Augusta Savage led various art classes in Harlem, and several other art leaders collaborated with the 135th Street Branch of the New York Public Library in establishing community workshops. The Harlem YMCA also held art classes between 1934 and 1935 led by sculptor William Artis. The idea for the Harlem Community Art Center came from African-American artists in the Harlem Artists Guild. They envisioned a community space free to all, making art instruction accessible. The Harlem Community Art Center was based on the ideal that art was central to community, and aspired to be both a space for exposing people to art and an institution for developing African-American artists. The Harlem Community Art Center was a WPA-sponsored center in operation from November 1937 to 1942. The center was first directed by Augusta Savage, and Gwendolyn Bennett assumed the role afterward. It is widely considered a focal arena for the Harlem Renaissance.  Significance  Henry Bannarn, an instructor at the Harlem Community Art Center (1937) In its first 16 months, 70,592 people attended Harlem Community Art Center activities and more than 1,500 took part in day or evening classes in drawing, painting, sculpture, printmaking and design. Artists who taught or studied at the center include Charles Alston, Henry Bannarn, Romare Bearden, Selma Burke, Ernest Crichlow, Aaron Douglas, Elton Fax, Sargent Johnson, William Henry Johnson, Langston Hughes, Ronald Joseph,Robert Blackburn, Jacob Lawrence, Norman Lewis, Claude McKay, James Lesene Wells and Richard Wright. Also the center had the chance to influence more than just adults \\"And who are these people who have been reached by the Center? Exactly 2,467 children and adults have registered in the art classes. More than 23,989 people have participated in the Center's extension activities, lectures, and demonstrations. Thousands of others come to the Center regularly to see the exhibitions and to attend other special events\\". Psychiatric Wards would send mentally ill children to the center and they flourished. The Harlem Community Art Center had a multiethnic faculty and a diverse student population was also diverse. Students ranged from established Harlem artists to children from New York psychiatric hospitals who benefitted from creative activities.

She is the co-director and co-founder of the International Association of Sufism (IAS), founder of the International Sufi Women Organization, the executive editor of the journal Sufism: An Inquiry, the main representative of the IAS to the United Nations (for Non Governmental Organization with the Department of Public Information: NGO/DPI), and the creator of the Building Bridges of Understanding Series.International Association of Sufism She has written over twenty published books and many articles, and has lectured on Sufism, spirituality, human rights and peace at the United Nations; at the Smithsonian Institution; at Science and Spirituality, Italy; at the Council for a Parliament of the World's Religions (CPWR) conferences in Cape Town, and in Barcelona; UNESCO's culture of peace conference in Mexico, among others. She was among the distinguished Sufi leaders and scholars invited to gather for the first annual Shakir World Encounters in Marrakesh, Morocco in 2004. She is the first Muslim woman inducted to the Marin Women's Hall of Fame, honored at Visionary Marin in 2012 by the Marin Interfaith Council, and the Huffington Post named her as one of the 50 Powerful Women Religious Leaders To Celebrate On International Women's Day, 2014. She has been an active advocate for human rights with a focus on women's rights.  Early life and background  Angha is the daughter of the 20th century Persian Sufi master Moulana Shah Maghsoud (d. 1980) of the Uwaiysi lineage. Her mother, Mah Talat Etemad Moghadam (d. 2012), was from one of the prominent Persian families, and a descendant of Etemad Saltaneh whose journals and memoirs remained as one of the important manuscripts on Qajar Dynasty, Iran. Her father appointed her to teach and lead Sufi gatherings when she was in her early twenties. She initially held gatherings at her father's Khaneghah in Sufi Abad, Iran, she continued to teach in the United States. Angha has studied at the University of Teheran, Iran; SW Missouri State University, US; and University of Exeter, UK, and has doctorate degrees in Psychology and in Islamic Studies. Angha has two daughters, Hamaseh and Sahar and she lives in California with her family. She began her humanitarian, interreligious collaboration and peace efforts in the US in the early 1980s and continues those efforts today.  Spiritual, educational, and advocacy initiatives  Angha, together with her husband Ali Kianfar, co-founded the International Association of Sufism(IAS), a California non-profit devoted to the teachings of Sufism and Sufi Masters of the past and present (1983). Historically, Sufis have made great contributions to the development of science, literature, poetic styles, astronomy, architectural designs, and more. The International Association of Sufism has as its mission to make known the interrelations between Sufi principles and scientific principles through lectures, publications, Sufism An Inquiry Journal, and creating a forum for a continuing dialogue among Sufis from around the world. Angha has said that it took her about ten years to gather Sufi schools and Sufi masters from around the globe for the first Annual Sufism Symposium, a weekend conversation in March 1994; she considers organizing that Symposium one of her greatest achievements. Her vision and tireless works brought together Sufis masters and schools from around the globe, an unprecedented effort that made the International Association of Sufism the first organization ever created to initiate a global intra-faith movement within the Sufi community, and she became one of the leading Sufi voices for women's rights. As a response to the need at the time, she expanded the IAS' roles to include humanitarian, interfaith collaboration, and human rights advocacy. Through her efforts IAS received a UN NGO/DPI status, in 1997, and her peace works have also made the IAS a Messenger of UNESCO's Manifesto 2000 for contributing to a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence. She serves as IAS main representative to the NGO/DPI. In 2015 she celebrated the twentieth anniversary of the Sufism Symposium, and published the history and the biography of over 140 Sufis masters and interfaith leaders who have participated and presented during those twenty years in Caravan: Biographies from Sufism Symposia 1994‚Äì2014. In support of and to advocate for expressive art and to honor the roles of sacred lyrics, hymns and songs of faith traditions in our social justice and civil rights movements, she organized the Songs of the Soul Poetry and Sacred Music Festival, 2012, and Building Bridges of Understanding: Expressions in 2014, highlighting the beauty of poetry and sacred music in spirituality and faith traditions.  International Sufi Women Organization  Women have played important roles in the development of art, science, education, entertainment, politics and more, yet the field of religion remains one of the most challenging for women's leadership. It is important to also acknowledge women who, through their endeavors and perseverance, have made contributions towards equality and freedom in the field of religion and spirituality. Angha has been one of those pioneers whose vision of and works towards humanitarian efforts, inter-religious dialogue and intra-religious movement, equality, peace, and freedom have played fundamental roles in creating the International Sufi Women Organization in 1993.  Breaking gender roles  Angha has made a point in her work to redefine the social standard for gender roles in the Sufi religious context. At the 1994 Sufism Symposium, as the first Sufi woman sitting together with male leaders in the center circle of zikr, a position historically reserved for men, she led meditation and paved the way for other Muslim women to participate and lead in Sufi worship. Her efforts continue to create forums for harmonious, global, peaceful dialogue within Sufi communities as well as normalizing the leadership of Sufi women in the traditional Sufi gatherings.  Global dialogue, humanitarian efforts, women's leadership  Through her efforts and the works of many Sufi women from around the globe, the Sufi Women Organization was able to create a global dialogue among women of different cultures and spiritual backgrounds with the goals to promote women's rights, promote the right to education, and to create social awareness as a pathway towards peace. In 1999, it held its first international conference on Women's Wisdom, Women in Action which hosted women leaders from diverse spiritual and cultural backgrounds for a weekend conversation in 1999. The Organization has also created a thirteen-article Code of Ethics to promote human rights, the right to education, equality, support those who are oppressed or abused, and promote equality of genders in both spiritual and secular domains. Angha organized a series of workshops and round table discussions on the prevention of domestic violence in 2004 and 2005 in California, as well as a round table research program series on cross-cultural study of Middle Eastern families recently migrated to the US, which studied and discussed how they were coping with the new culture, language, and environment, and sought how to learn the pressures of the new environment affect spousal relationships, parent/child relationships, parent/teen relationships, and sibling relationships. Angha has organized a team of well-accomplished women to oversee the Sufi Women Organization's women's leadership series, begun in 1993. She has also initiated a youth organization with a multi-religious, multicultural unified voice to advocate for children's rights, Voice for Justice, which has earned ambassadorship status from UNICEF, created programs such as: Summer 2016 free breakfast for school children of low-income families and has partnered with several humanitarian organizations to support the well-being of all including social justice programs; and HIV/AIDs prevention; Aids Walk; Cancer Awareness; Education: Adopt a classroom, and more.  Partnerships: humanitarian and peacemaking efforts  Angha says that globalization leads to partnership, and valuable partnership expands the mission of organizations, and following her own ideology, she has initiated partnerships with other like-minded organizations to establish greater possibilities to contribute towards humanitarian efforts. Through these partnerships, IAS and SWO and its Chapters, both local and international, were able to expand their charitable efforts to include care for children caught in refugee and migrant crises; providing basic medicine and clean water in refugee areas; educational scholarship; ending HIV through training local nurses; orphan care; health education; mobile health clinics in Africa; and in California, SWO was able to contribute towards medical case management, free testing, and free syringes in its work to end HIV by 2030. Her continual advocacy for non-violent solutions for women and children in conflict areas has led her to participate in peace campaigns, including National Interreligious Leadership Initiative For Peace In The Middle East, \\"The Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders,\\" and present talks regarding women's rights and humanitarian intervention, such as: \\"Human rights, responsibilities and spirituality\\" at the 53rd Annual United Nations DPI/NGO Conference at the UN Headquarters; \\"Women in Islam: Sufi Women & Human Rights,\\" Cape Town 1999; \\"Human Dignity and the New Frontier of Science,\\" Italy; she has also written many articles on those topics.  Interfaith (partial list)  Her works in collaboration with inter-religious organizations and faith traditions began in the early 1980s. She has served in many-faith based organizations (1983‚Äì2016), including as a Board member as well as a President of the Board of Directors of the Interfaith Center at the Presidio, San Francisco; the Board of Directors of the Marin Interfaith Council; a Founding member of the United Religions Initiative (URI) Council for Women; the Board of Directors of Marin Museum of American Indian; a Member of the Assembly of the Parliament of the World Religions, Cape Town and Barcelona; a Member of the National Interreligious Leadership Delegation; a Member of the Assembly for UNESCO: Culture of Peace, Mexico; on the Advisory Board of the Mystic Heart Institute; on the Advisory Board of the Institute for World Religions; Scholar Advisor for Interfaith Sacred Space, presented at the CPWR conference in Spain, 2004; and she presented Bay Area faith communities to the Goldin Institute, in Manresa, Spain, and more.  Higher education  First conceived by Angha, and highly supported by Harlan Stelmach, who was the Chair and Professor of Humanities at Dominican University of California in 2000, the Building Bridges series began with an interfaith forum to explore shared spiritual values that could help the community respond to and heal from the crises of September 11, 2001. In 2002, Angha invited leaders of existing religions and traditions in northern California including Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, Sikhism, Islam, Native American, Zoroastrian, Barahma Kumaris, and the Bahai to serve as the decision-making members of the Program Committee for the Building Bridges of Understanding, or to lead presentations for the sake of peace and inter-religious dialogue. She also invited the members of academia and civil society, to join together in this pursuit, including street chaplaincy, community healing centers, abused women's services, youth leadership, and others. Among the highlights of her work was inviting Shirin Ebadi to the Dominican Campus in 2006 to present a lecture on: Human Rights, Islam and the West. \\"Communities ensure the well being of their members through shared information, concerns, resolutions, awareness, active participation, appreciation, and creation of common ground, and beneficial goals and hope for the future of communities, societies and nations,\\" she said in her closing remarks at the first Building Bridges of Understanding conference. For that very reason, she developed an educational series for understanding major religions of the world, and their roles in creating peace, encouraging dialogue, creating higher education and more. The series included: Understanding Native American Spirituality; Understanding Judaism; Understanding Islam; Understanding Hinduism; Understanding Buddhism; and Understanding Zoroastrian. Angha has also extended the Building Bridges series to include the roles that compassion, tolerance, enlightenment, ethics and morality, care for the Earth, experiencing peace through healing arts, etc. have played in our lives, and the lives of cultures and nations. Through her efforts the program created scholarship award for a student of the Humanities, including Religion, whose scholarship or community service reflects the spirit of the Building Bridges of Understanding series. Angha's advocacy for women's leadership led her to initiate The Women's Leadership Series within the Building Bridges of Understanding series. The Women's Leadership Series brought together women in leadership positions to share their experiences and endeavors with the younger generation. The series addressed topics such as women's leadership and global awareness; and navigating the language of power, as well as self-awareness and leadership.

(1799) by John Cary The Russo-Prussian alliance signed by the Kingdom of Prussia and the Russian Empire on 11 April 1764. It was pivotal to the people of Prussia and Russia, and it followed the end of the Seven Years' War. The alliance agreement expanded on the Treaty of Saint Petersburg of 1762, which ended the war between those two countries. It was a defensive alliance, in which each party declared it would protect the territorial stability of the other. It further allowed both countries to intervene in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, which was one of the primary intentions of the treaty. Genesis and intention Nikita Panin, the creator of the treaty establishing the Russo-Prussian alliance The treaty was a creation of the Russian diplomat Nikita Ivanovich Panin. It expanded on the Treaty of Saint Petersburg of 1762, which ended the fighting in the Seven Years' War between Prussia and Russia. Signed on 11 April 1764, it laid the foundation for the \\"northern system\\" in Russian politics in which Russia and Prussia were allied with Great Britain. Although the Anglo-Prussian Alliance had waned around that time, the ties between Great Britain and Russia strengthened, with a trade alliance signed in 1766. The alliance was defensive in nature, each party declaring it would protect the territorial stability of the other. This provided Prussia with important security on the international scene by turning its most dangerous enemy into an ally. The alliance was also aimed at counteracting the power of the Austrian, or Habsburg, Empire. From Russia's perspective, Austria had been less willing to compromise on issues related to the expanding Russian sphere of influence and was thus less attractive as an ally at that time. According to some historians, Russia would become the dominating partner in the alliance, partially fulfilling one of its goals from the Seven Years' War: increased influence over Prussia. Others have taken the view that the treaty was a skillful victory for Prussia despite the tendency of Russia to treat Prussia as a junior partner. Shortly before his death, Frederick the Great of Prussia declared that it was the most advantageous treaty he had made. Not insignificantly, the treaty also allowed Prussia and Russia to exercise better control over the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth; both parties agreed to prevent the election of a third king from the House of Saxony. The two countries thus worked together to ensure the election of their own candidate, Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, later that year. The treaty also included a provision allowing the signatories to intervene in Poland in case of an unapproved regime change. In fact, the two powers, together with Austria, would intervene jointly in Poland following the War of the Bar Confederation, resulting in the First Partition of Poland in 1772. Dissolution and aftermath Detail of an 1847 portrait of Grigory Potemkin, who advocated closer ties between Russia and Austria However, over the next few decades, Russia's attention was increasingly drawn towards the south and the Ottoman Empire. Advocated by Grigory Potemkin, this new direction reduced the strategic value of Prussia as an ally to Russia, and made Austria once again a more appealing candidate. The Russo-Prussian alliance was again extended in 1777, but at the imperial court in Saint Petersburg the influence of Panin's pro-Prussian faction was eclipsed by Potemkin's pro-Austrian one. After the death of Maria Theresa of Austria, Joseph II of Austria favored improving relations with Russia, and secret negotiations began in early 1781, resulting in an Austro-Russian alliance formed around May and June 1781. The Russo-Prussian alliance existed formally until 1788, but it lost most of its significance upon the declaration of the Austro-Russian alliance, which isolated Prussia on the international scene. Prussia would hence seek a new alliance with Great Britain. The end of this alliance also marked the downfall of Panin, who once said that his own political survival was tied to this treaty.

She dreams of marrying Arjun Agnihotri (Sudeep Sahir) but Lakshmi has only see Arjun once, when she was 9 years old. She doesn't know what he looks like today, because he went to London for 10 years to study. During one of the initial meetings between Arjun and Lakshmi, Arjun learns about Lakshmi's dream of marrying him and becoming rich. In the course of time, Arjun falls in love with Lakshmi but keeps his identity secret under the disguise of Ajay Sharma because he knew if Lakshmi learns about his real identity, she will marry him but just for money. So to make Lakshmi fall for him, he started helping her in every problem and as he lied Lakshmi that he works for Arjun. Lakshmi befriends him so that she could meet Arjun and impress him. Soon, Lakshmi falls for Ajay but just because he was a middle class man she never confessed her love. When she learns about his identity she confesses her love but he thinks she is just behind his money and rejects her. With passing time he realize that her love is true and they both decides to get married. But, Arjun's father Rajvardhan Agnihotri (Arbaaz Ali Khan), didn't accept Lakshmi as she was not rich enough and wanted Arjun to marry his childhood friend's daughter, Saumya Diwan (Nisha Rawal Mehra). Rajvardhan and Saumya try their best to stop the marriage but crossing all the hurdles they both get married. Saumya gets obsessed by Arjun and try every single thing to ruin their marriage in the meantime Agnihotri empire gets bankrupt and Agnihotris loose everything. They all have to shift to Lakshmi's house as there is no one to help them. This makes Rajvardhan to regret more about getting Arjun married to a middle class girl. They all try their best but could not do anything. Later, it is revealed that this bankruptcy was created by Saumya but nobody knows about this. Lakshmi attend the auction of Agnihotri Mansion and comes to know that Saumya bought the Mansion. Saumya keeps a deal to Lakshmi that if she agrees to share her husband Arjun then she'll name this Mansion and rest of their property to Arjun. Lakshmi agrees this deal but doesn't inform anyone about this. Everyone thinks that Saumya is doing this just for the sake of their friendship. After shifting to Agnihotri Mansion Saumya asked for her rights on Arjun. Lakshmi informs everyone about their deal. Arjun feels like Lakshmi sold him for money and distance her. But after this, Rajvardhan starts respecting Lakshmi and her sacrifice for the family. Soon, Lakshmi feels neglected and thinks that Arjun loves Saumya and Saumya is right girl for Arjun and Agnihotri family.

Arjun forgives Lakshmi and helps family to get her back. They plans a drama of Arjun getting blind. Doctor says that eye donation is the only option. Lakshmi comes to know about his condition and agrees to donate her eyes but the family acts as they hate her and don't want her eyes and asks Saumya to donate her eyes which she refuse to do so. This make her realise that she doesn't love Arjun and Lakshmi is the one for him. Saumya leaves Arjun and returns to London. Arjun and Lakshmi get remarried. 1 Year Later Arjun and Lakshmi's daughter, Jiyana Agnihotri, is born. Lakshmi dies just after giving birth to her. She knew about her pregnancy complications but never informed Arjun about this. The only one who knew this was Kishori (Pallavi Rao), Lakshmi's aunt. While she was pregnant she made some video diaries for their child. 7 Years Later A young woman named Kaanchi Kashyap (Shraddha Arya) who is Lakshmi's look-alike, is introduced. She helps her family run a restaurant. Arjun emphasizes that he will not remarry. Kaanchi says that until she makes her dreams of being the best Thali restaurant owner in Kanpur and establishes her chain of restaurants, she won't marry. Kaanchi and her family go to the mall to purchase items due to discount on 15 August. Jiyana (Roshni Walia) is now a 8-year-old girl and also comes to the mall. A group of thieves steal her chain in which a picture of Arjun and Lakshmi is kept. Kaanchi sees Jiyana chasing the thieves and helps Jiyana get her chain back. Jiyana is astonished that Kaanchi looks like Lakshmi. Kishori and Jiyana find Kaanchi in her restaurant. Jiyana and Kishori invite Kaanchi to see Arjun under the pretext of bringing a delivery. However, their plan fails when Arjun goes to the washroom when Kaanchi is about to go home. Kaanchi takes her leave from the Agnihotri family. Jiyana sobs at hearing the news. Kaanchi entreats an explanation from Aditya (Aadesh Chaudhary) who fancies her to love somebody else. Arjun sees Kanchi sad and helps her getting Aditya back by giving her a makeover. Arjun pretends to be Kanchi's boyfriend to make Aditya jealous. Meanwhile, Kaanchi sees that she is Lakshmi's look- alike. Due to a marriage hall shortage, Kaanchi and Aditya's family come to Agnihotri Mansion for their wedding. During the event Arjun tries not to show that he started loving Kaanchi; on the other side, Kaanchi realizes that she loves Arjun. When Arjun is leaving for US, Kaanchi gets up from the mandap and runs behind Arjun to stop him and tells him that she loves him.

This number was reduced in successive designs, to twelve (second version, 1513), eight (third version, 1516) and finally maybe only four (fourth version, 1526, or fifth version, 1532), before being eliminated from the project altogether in the final version of 1542. The first members of the series, who are mentioned in Michelangelo's letters are the two Prigioni of Paris, named the \\"Slaves\\" in the nineteenth century: the Dying Slave and the Rebellious Slave. They were carved in Rome around 1513. The Florentine Prigioni (Young Slave, Bearded Slave, Atlas Slave and the Awakening Slave) were probably carved instead in the second half of the 1520s, while Michelangelo was employed at San Lorenzo in Florence (but historians suggest dates between 1519 and 1534). It is known that they were in the artist's warehouse on the via Mozza in 1544, when his nephew Leonardo Buonarroti asked permission to sell them (Michelangelo did not visit Florence after 1534). The permission was denied and only in 1564 were they donated, along with the Genius of Victory, to the Grand Duke Cosimo I who placed them at the four corners of the Grotto of Buontalenti in 1591. They were removed from there in 1908, in order to be reunited with other works of Michelangelo in the Florentine gallery. With respect to the exact date, Justi (and others) propose 1519, on the basis of a letter of 13 February, in which Jacopo Salviati promised the cardinal Aginesis, Julius II's heir, that the sculptor would have the four figures for the tomb ready by the summer of that year; Wilde proposes 1523, pointing to a statement of the cardinal Giulio de' Medici (the future Clement VII) who had seen them before he departed for Rome in that year; finally de Tolnay dates them to 1530‚Äì1534 on the basis on their style, frequent references to incomplete sculptures for the pope's tomb in letters of 1531‚Äì2 and Vasari's statement that they were created while the artist was preparing the cartoon of The Last Judgment.  Description and style  The Bearded Slave is the most finished of the Florentine Prigioni and gets his name from his thick, curly beard. The way his muscular torso twists indicates a deep knowledge of anatomy, typical of the best works of Michelangelo; his legs, slightly bent and separated, are covered by a band of fabric. His right arm is raised to hold his bent head, while his left hand remains unfinished, but seems to hold the band of fabric. The whole surface retains many traces of the various chisels and scrapers used on the sculpture. Along his hips there is a repaired fracture, whose cause is unknown. Its unfinished state creates an extraordinary energy (already noted by Bocchi in 1591), with the figure caught in a sort of primordial act of freeing himself from the cage of the rough stone, an epic battle with the forces of chaos. The iconographic meaning of the figures was probably linked to the motif of the captivi in Roman art, and indeed Vasari identified the Prigioni as personifications of the provinces controlled by Julius II. For Condivi, however, they symbolised the Arts, made \\"prisoners\\" by the death of the pontif. Other scholars have made proposals of a philosophical/symbolic character or connected to the artist's personal life and his \\"torments\\".

A tropical depression developed on September 30, 1972. It then moved west northwest and intensified into a hurricane on October 1. Hurricane Joanne peaked as a Category 2 hurricane, as measured by the modern Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS), October 2. Joanne then slowed and began to re-curve. Joanne made landfall along the northern portion of the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm. The tropical storm moved inland over Sonora on October 6 and was believed to have survived into Arizona as a tropical storm. In Arizona, many roads were closed and some water rescues had to be performed due to a prolonged period of heavy rains. One person was reportedly killed while another was electrocuted. A few weeks after the hurricane, Arizona would sustain additional flooding and eight additional deaths. Meteorological history On September 26, ship reports and satellite imagery indicated an area of squally weather about south of Guatemala. During September 27 and September 28, the disturbance moved westward. On September 29, the disturbance developed a closed low-level atmospheric circulation. The following day, the system was designated as a tropical storm after a ship reported winds of . A Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigated the growing storm on October 1 and estimated maximum sustained winds of , making Joanne a Category 1 hurricane. However, very few ships reported winds greater than at that time. On October 2, the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Database, noted that the hurricane had intensified into a Category 2 system, with winds peaking at while turning towards the northwest. On October 4, Joanne began to recurve, and developed winds of . Later that day, the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC) downgraded Joanne into a tropical storm as the system weakened. Accelerating north and later northeast, Joanne made landfall near Laguna Chapala on Baja California while a tropical storm late on October 5\\\\. Although records from the EPHC suggest that the tropical storm moved inland over Sonora on October 6, it is likely that Joanne moved northeast into western Pima County as a minimal tropical storm. Tropical Storm Joanne weakened to a depression near Ajo, but made it all the way to Flagstaff before finally dissipating. Impact Hurricane Joanne approaching land The initial disturbance to Joanne brought squally weather to Guatemala. Upon making landfall in Mexico, the highest rainfall total was in San Felipe/Mexicali. Puerto Penasco recorded winds of . Further north, Joanne caused heavy surf in California, and brought tropical storm-force winds to the state. Prior to landfall, flash flood watches were issued for the southern portion of the state. Heavy rainfall was reported throughout Arizona. Over was measured at the Mogollon Rim. Many areas of the state received between of rainfall, with isolated locations receiving over . In Phoenix, of rain fell in a four-hour period, compared to the October average of . The Nogales Highway Bridge over the Santa Cruz River was washed away by the flooding. Some secondary roads near Tucson were flooded. Numerous water rescues were conducted in central Tucson since several major streets turned into rivers. Severe flooding was recorded in Clifton, Duncan, and Safford. An official in Maricopa County lost track on the exact number of roads that were closed because of the hurricane. Many neighborhoods in northern Phoenix were evacuated early on October 7 when a canal overflowed its banks due to prolonged rainfall. Downtown, a young man was electrocuted when he tried to remove a downed power line that was on his car. One person was also killed in the city. Following the storm, heavy rain from Joanne set the stage for additional flooding in mid-to late October from a Gulf of Alaska extratropical cyclone that brought more moisture to the area, causing $10 million (1972 USD) in property damage and eight deaths. Further west in New Mexico, the hurricane produced of precipitation. Hurricane Joanne is one of only four known Pacific hurricanes to bring gale-force winds to the Continental United States, and was the first since the 1939 California tropical storm. According to the National Weather Service, it was the first time in recorded history that a tropical cyclone had brought gale-force winds to Arizona.

It is one of the 'Prisoners', the series of unfinished sculptures for the tomb of Pope Julius II. It is now held in the Galleria dell'Accademia in Florence. It seems that from the first project for the tomb of Julius II (1505) in the lower register of the mausoleum were planned a series of \\"Prisons\\", that is, a series of statues larger than the life of figures chained in various poses as prisoners, precisely, to be placed on the pillars that framed niches and topped with Hermes. Paired with each niche (in which a winged victory was planned) they were to initially be sixteen or twenty, being gradually reduced in the projects that followed, to twelve (second project, 1513), eight (third project, 1516) and finally perhaps only four (perhaps from the fourth or fifth project, 1526 and 1532), and then definitively eliminated in the final project of 1542. The first of the series, of which traces can be found in Michelangelo's chart, are the two Prisons of Paris, called from the nineteenth century \\"Slaves\\": the Dying Slave and the Rebel Slave. They were carved in Rome around 1513. The Florentine Prisons (Young Slave, Bearded Slave, Atlas, Slave who is reamed) may have been carved in the second half of the 1520s, while the master was engaged at San Lorenzo in Florence (but historians have proposed dating ranging from 1519 to 1534). It is known that they were in the artist's workshop in Via Mozza again in 1544, when Michelangelo's nephew, Leonardo Buonarroti, asked permission to sell them (Michelangelo did not set foot in Florence again after 1534). The permit was denied and only in 1564 they were donated, with the Genius of Victory, to Grand Duke Cosimo I who then placed them at the four corners of the Cave of Buontalenti, by 1591. From there they were removed in 1908 to gather them at the michelangiolesco corpus that was forming in the Florentine Gallery.

It is now held in the Louvre in Paris.  History  The two \\"slaves\\" of the Louvre date to the second version of the tomb of Pope Julius II which was commissioned by the Pope's heirs, the Della Rovere in May 1513. Although the initial plans for a gigantic mausoleum were set aside, the work was still monumental, with a corridor richly decorated with sculpture and Michelangelo was immediately put in charge of the work. Among the first pieces completed were the two Prigioni (renamed the \\"slaves\\" only in the nineteenth century), destined for the lower part of the funerary monument, next to the pilasters which framed the niches containing the Victories. Their poses were determined by the needs of this architectural setting, so from the front they have great effect, but the side views received less care than usual. The date of the two statues is confirmed by a letter of Michelangelo to Marcello dei Covi, in which he speaks of a viewing by Luca Signorelli in his Roman house, while he worked on \\"a figure of marble, standing four cubits high, which has its hands behind its back\\". All the Prigioni produced in the studio of the artist were eliminated from the monument in its final version, completed in 1542. In 1546 Michelangelo gave the two works in the Louvre to Roberto Strozzi, for his generous hospitality in his Roman house during Michelangelo's periods of sickness in July 1544 and June 1546. When Strozzi was exiled to Lyon in April 1550 for his opposition to Cosimo I de' Medici, he had the two statues sent ahead. In April 1578 they were put on view in two niches in the courtyard of the castle of the constable of Montmorency at √âcouen, near Paris. In 1632 they were sold by Henri II de Montmorency to Cardinal Richelieu, who had them sent to his Ch√¢teau in Poitou, where they were seen by Gianlorenzo Bernini who made an illustration of them, on his travels. In 1749, the Duke of Richelieu had them taken to Paris and placed in the Pavillon de Hanovre. They were hidden in 1793, but when the widow of the last Marshal of Richelieu attempted to put them on sale, they became property of the government and joined the collection which is now in the Louvre.  Description and style  The \\"Rebellious Slave\\" is portrayed trying to free himself from the fetters which hold his hands behind his back, contorting his torso and twisting his head. The impression given, which would have contributed to the spatial appearance of the monument, was that he was moving towards the viewer, with his raised shoulder and knee. The iconographic significance of the two figures is probably linked to the motif of the Captive in Roman art; in fact Giorgio Vasari identified them as personifications of the provinces controlled by Julius II. For Ascanio Condivi, however, they symbolised the Arts taken prisoner after the death of pontif. The Rebellious Slave in particular might, speculatively, represent sculpture or architecture. Other meanings of a symbolic and philosophical nature have been suggested as well as some linked to Michelangelo's personal life and his \\"torments\\". From a stylistic point of view, they are based on ancient models, particularly Hellenistic sculpture, like the statue group of Laoco√∂n and His Sons, discovered in 1506 and at that time in Michelangelo's possession, but also the sculptural friezes on the triumphal arches of Rome and depictions of Saint Sebastian.

Russia was previously allied with Prussia (Russo-Prussian alliance). However, with time, Russia's attention was increasingly drawn towards the south, and the Ottoman Empire. Advocated by Grigory Potemkin, this new direction reduced the strategic value of Prussia as an ally to Russia, and made Austria once again a more appealing candidate. The Russo-Prussian alliance was once again extended in 1777, but at the imperial court in Saint Petersburg, Panin pro-Prussian faction's influence was eclipsed by the Potemkin's pro-Austrian one.A.

The Prusso-Russian alliance existed formally until 1788, but it lost most if its significance upon the declaration of the Austro-Russian alliance, which isolated Prussia on the international scene. The most notable consequence of the Austro-Russian alliance was the Austro-Turkish War (1787‚Äì1791) and the Russo-Turkish War (1787‚Äì1792).

It is written in PHP, supports MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite as database systems and, in addition, has database failover support. It is available in multiple languages and is licensed under the LGPL. History and development MyBB 1.0 and 1.1 Founded as DevBB in 2002 by Chris Boulton from a fork of XMB, the first public release (RC1) of MyBB was published on 10 December 2003. It wasn't until 2 years later, on 9 December 2005, that MyBB 1.0 was released. On 9 March 2006, version 1.1 was released. The last version of this series was 1.1.8, a security update released on 20 August 2006. MyBB 1.2 On 2 September 2006, with a revised and rewritten code base and over 40 new features, MyBB 1.2 was released. Support for the 1.2 series officially ended on 1 June 2009, although security updates were available until 31 December 2009. The final version of the 1.2 series, 1.2.14, was a security and maintenance update published on 17 July 2008. Several security patches were available in consequent security updates for users still using the 1.2 series. MyBB 1.4 After a long beta phase MyBB 1.4 was released on 2 August 2008 complete with over 70 new features, including a completely revised and redesigned Administration Control Panel (ACP). On 12 October 2008, MyBB 1.4.2 was released. This version changed MyBB's license from proprietary to GNU GPL v3. The change in license was driven from a request from KDE who, in a related announcement, launched their first web-based community using MyBB as an alternative to a mailinglist. On 2 May 2009, due to time constraints, founder Chris Boulton left the day-to-day responsibilities to Dennis Tsang (previously the Support Team Manager) who took over as Product Manager of MyBB. Matt Rogowski would later take over Dennis' responsibilities as Support Team Manager. So far, much of MyBB's development happened internally on a closed cycle. After switching to an open source license, on 19 August 2009, the MyBB Group opened development access so that users had access to the official bugtracker and read access to the subversion repository. The final version in the 1.4 series was 1.4.16, released as a security update on 17 April 2011. Support for the series ended on 1 July 2011 for both maintenance and security releases. MyBB 1.6 On 3 August 2010, on the 2 year anniversary of MyBB 1.4's release, MyBB 1.6 was released with over 40 new features and included many tweaks, fixes and performance optimizations. The 1.6 series is distributed under the GNU LGPL v3 and requires at least PHP 5.1. During the 1.6 series, several senior members of the MyBB Group changed positions. On 3 October 2010, Tim Bell was promoted to Product Manager with responsibilities of running the day-to-day operations of MyBB as well as the marketing aspect of the MyBB product. Dennis Tsang took a position as Technical Advisor, helping with software design and development of MyBB. The old MyBB logo On 5 December 2010 Ryan Gordon, the lead developer of MyBB for the past 5 years, resigned to pursue new challenges. As a result, Tom Moore took over Ryan's responsibilities for development and Dylan M took over management of the MyBB Merge System. MyBB 1.6.4, released 26 July 2011, was one of the largest MyBB updates and the first release in MyBB's history that required all core files to be replaced due to errors in previous releases of 1.6. It was also the first release to include feature changes which are normally reserved for major point (feature) releases, but was marred upon discovery that the release had been contaminated during a MyBB server breach with dangerous code that could be used to exploit forum installations running 1.6.4. The step to include new feature updates was taken to extend the life of the 1.6 series while MyBB's next series, MyBB 2.0, was being developed. On 25 November 2011, MyBB 1.6.5 was released. This version included over 10 new feature updates, including reCAPTCHA support and advancements to prevent spam users. On 10 February 2012, MyBB 1.6.6 was released as a security update. It fixed 14 low-risk vulnerabilities and fixed an issue allowing for the import of a non-CSS stylesheet. MyBB also fixed a bug in 1.6.5 where announcements would disappear. On 14 February 2012, the MyBB Group announced that MyBB 1.6.6 was originally released with development code unintentionally included. On March 31, 2012, MyBB 1.6.7 was released, fixing over 70 issues, and introducing 5 feature updates. It fixed 4 SQL Injection vulnerabilities (low risk), an XSS vulnerability, and a path disclosure issue. The feature updates included wider display of Forum Rules, Custom Moderator Tool permissions, an override permission for sending an email to a user who has ignored you, and the ability for a user to log in with their email address. On May 27, 2012, MyBB 1.6.8 was released. It was a general maintenance release and fixes over 40 reported issues.

In this version was fixed a high risk SQL vulnerability when editing a post and another medium vulnerability about CAPTCHA systems. Also was fixed a bug related to the editor that not working in Firefox 16 (and above). On April 22, 2013, MyBB 1.6.10 was released. It was a security & maintenance release. It saw the fixation of seven minor vulnerabilities and over 95 reported bugs causing the incorrect utilization. A considerable amount of effort has been put into MyBB 1.6.10 to fix a myriad of issues with PHP 5.4. On October 8, 2013, MyBB 1.6.11 was released. It was a security & maintenance release.

MyBB 1.8 The new MyBB Logo, used from MyBB 1.8.0 onwards. The MyBB Team said many times that MyBB would be jumping directly from MyBB 1.6 to 2.0. However, on 1 April 2012, the MyBB group announced that there would in fact be a MyBB 1.8. Many considered this to be an April Fool's joke. Then, on 3 April 2012, another blog post was released saying that \\"it was no April Fool\\". MyBB 1.8 will feature a new default theme based on MyBB lead designer Justin S.'s Apart theme series. A brand new feature to do with themes was announced: The post went on to say that MyBB's default JavaScript library would be changed to the more popular jQuery from the current Prototype JavaScript Framework. A new \\"trash can\\" soft delete feature was also announced that allows deleted posts to be recovered in the Moderator Control Panel. It was also mentioned that instead of releasing an official anti-spam plugin as planned called Spam Ninja, the MyBB Team would be added many new anti-spam features directly to the MyBB core. The MyBB Team also announced that the development SVN repository would be moving from their own dev site at dev.mybb.com to GitHub. The GitHub repository was opened to the public on January 23, 2013. All open issues on the development site were moved to GitHub on March 3, 2014. The actual transfer of issues occurred just before midnight the day before. On June 1, 2014, MyBB 1.8 Beta 1 was released for the public to test and report bugs and issues. On July 1, 2014, MyBB 1.8 Beta 2 was released for the public to test and report bugs and issues. It included 5 new features and several enhancements since the first beta. On July 21, 2014, MyBB 1.8 Beta 3 was released for the public to test and report bugs and issues. It was the last beta release before MyBB 1.8 went 'gold'. It included 8 new features and several enhancements since the second beta. On September 1, 2014, MyBB 1.8 was released with over 24 new features and many enhancements. These changes include: a new theme (for both the front-end forum and back-end Admin CP), IPv6 features, soft delete and the much anticipated change of JavaScript library from Prototype to the more popular jQuery. The release also saw an updated website design and the implementation of the new logo and brand.

On May 27, 2015, MyBB 1.8.5 was released. It was a security and maintenance release. This release fixed 6 security vulnerabilities and 58 reported issues. The latest version of MyBB 1.8.x is 1.8.19, released on September 11, 2018. =Branding changes= On April 22, 2011, the MyBB Group announced that they were looking for a \\"creative doodler\\" to create a mascot for MyBB. Mike Creuzer, of Audentio Design, was chosen for the job. The new MyBB mascot and logo were officially announced on January 12, 2012. A forum discussion was created to propose names for the mascot. The top ten names were placed into a poll, and the community voted and decided upon the name \\"Bolt\\", representing MyBB founder Chris Boulton and the speediness and ease of use MyBB has. MyBB 1.9 After a community vote, development of 2.0 was put on hold and development shifted to smaller 1.x updates that can be rolled out in a quicker fashion, starting with 1.9.https://blog.mybb.com/2018/06/28/mybb-2-0-is-being- put-on-hold/ 1.9 will feature a responsive theme written with the Twig template system, replace the current editor with TinyMCE and introducing the Swiftmailer mail handler. Lead Developer Euan says beta version of MyBB 1.9 will land by March 2019. Some customization abilities will be added to the admin control panel. MyBB 2.0 The next major release of MyBB will be 2.0, targeted for a release within MyBB's typical release cycle. Currently in early development, it is being rewritten from scratch in a MVC method, using the Laravel PHP web application framework. The GitHub development repository will be opened to the public for contributions and an alpha download released once the new code-base becomes \\"working software with all the basics\\". Donation drive On 27 April 2010, the MyBB Group started a donation drive in an effort to purchase the mybb.com domain name. The Group needed to raise $5,000 from community donations for the transfer, and with founder Chris Boulton and community member Jesse Labrocca personally providing $1,000, that left $3,000 from the community. Just a month later, on 27 May 2010, MyBB.com was transferred and in use across the site. Features Database support MyBB supports multiple database engines. It currently supports MySQL, PgSQL, and SQLite v2 and v3. MyBB also supports database failover support so that if one database fails, MyBB will load the next database on the list. Master and slave databases are also configurable. Plugins and themes MyBB plugins are written in PHP and use hooking techniques. Unlike other software like WordPress, plugins need to be uploaded via FTP as uploading from the admin panel is not supported without a plugin.http://mods.mybb.com/view/plugin-uploader However, this is a considerable advantage over the old extension method used by phpBB where all modifications are core file edits. MyBB Themes are written inside the Admin Control Panel, and exported to an XML file. The XML file includes all modified MyBB templates and CSS stylesheets, which is redistributed alongside any extra resources (such as images) in a Zip file. There are over 2,400 plugins and themes on the MyBB mods website. Many other MyBB resource sites, such as MyBBCentral or MyBB-Plugins also offer exclusive, and sometimes paid, plugins and themes. Security MyBB has a relatively low-risk security record. In August 2008, MyBB performed a security audit (provided by GulfTech) which led to the release of MyBB 1.4.2 on 17 September 2008. The MyBB Group put security first, giving it the highest priority, to the extent that the MyBB website has a \\"Security Hall of Fame\\" to recognise those who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities in the software. In October 2011, MyBB found 3rd party code had contaminated the 1.6.4 release files. This code could be exploited to open a security vulnerability on a forum running the affected version. It was later found that a security flaw in the custom CMS mybb.com uses to power its website allowed a malicious user to alter the download files to include their own code. As a result of the intrusion, the MyBB Group now hosts downloads via GitHub to ensure the security of a release. A Forum Security section on the MyBB Community Forums opened in 2011 to provide support for users who have been a victim of an exploit. Throughout 2011, automated registrations caused forum spam in many MyBB powered forums. In MyBB 1.6.5, released on 25 November 2011, additional methods were added to help administrators locate spam users and manage them effectively as well as providing standard reCAPTCHA support. In May 2012, hacktivist group UGNazi gained unauthorized control over the MyBB.com domain name using a social engineering technique. The attack appears to have been motivated by the use of the MyBB software by a third-party website, HackForums.Twitter / UG: HF Uses Mybb, We're tired. Twitter.com.

It is 2.61 m high and is now in the Salone dei Cinquecento of the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence.  History  The exact date of execution of the statue is unknown, but it is usually related to the project for the tomb of Julius II. It is thought to have been intended for one of the lower niches of one of the last projects for the tomb, perhaps that of 1532 for which the so-called Captives or \\"Provinces\\" now in the Galleria dell'Accademia of Florence may have also been made. On the other hand, the monument may have been coupled with a similar pair of fighters, a clay model in the Casa Buonarroti ‚Äì the so-called Hercules-Samson. With the famous statue unfinished, Victory forms an interesting footnote in history: left in the artist's studio after his final departure from Florence in 1534, it became the property of his nephew Leonardo Buonarroti, who first tried to sell it in 1544 without obtaining the necessary authorization from his uncle. Then, at the suggestion of Daniele da Volterra, he tried to place it on Michelangelo's tomb in Santa Croce (1564), but Giorgio Vasari, who was redesigning the church's interior, was against it being used there. At Vasari's suggestion, the statue was given to Duke Cosimo I de' Medici that year. Two early \\"Captives\\" originally intended for Julius's tomb ended up in France, while four larger figures, created much later, now in Florence's Accademia, were initially placed in Buontalenti's Grotto in the Boboli Gardens, after the artist's death. The Victory came to decorate the Salone dei Cinquecento of the Palazzo Vecchio. It was placed along the wall, among other victory groups inspired by Michelangelo's, such as the statues of the Labors of Hercules by Vincenzo de' Rossi and others. In 1868, three years after the opening of the National Museum of the Bargello, the statue was included in the collection of Florentine sculpture gathered in the museum. It was returned to the Palazzo Vecchio on 6 November 1921, and placed in a niche in the center of the back wall of the room, where, since the time Florence had been the capital of Italy (1865), the 19th-century statue of Savonarola had stood (now in Piazza Savonarola). Only in recent years has the Victory been restored to its former position along the right wall. Description and style The dating and attribution of the statue to the project of the tomb are based on stylistic elements that link the work to the Captives: the twisting of the body and the vigorous anatomy, as well as comparable proportions. In addition, the head has a crown of oak leaves that allude to the Della Rovere emblem. The sculpture does not represent a moment of fighting, but rather serves as an allegory of victoriousness. It depicts the winner who dominates the submissive loser with great agility, with one leg that blocks the body of the captive, who is folded and chained. The young man who is the victor is beautiful and elegant, while the dominated man is old and bearded, and dressed in the garb of an ancient Roman warrior. The surfaces are treated expressively to enhance the contrast between the two figures: the young polished to perfection, the old rough and incomplete, still retaining the compressed boulder-like solidity of the heavy stone from which it was made. According to some scholars, the inspiration for the titular figure was Tommaso dei Cavalieri, a young Roman nobleman known to Michelangelo in Rome in 1532, to whom he dedicated love poems, and the older figure alludes to Michelangelo himself.Roy Doliner, Benjamin Blech, I segreti della Sistina.

Girl With Blue Hair by Blanche Grambs Life She was born in Beijing, China. She trained at the Art Students League in New York under Harry Sternberg. She worked in the Works Progress Administration's Federal Art Project during the New Deal, beginning in 1936 and producing over 30 prints for the WPA. Grambs was actively political, attending classes in Marxist theory at the New York Workers School and participating in communist rallies. She was arrested in 1936 at an organized sit-in, protesting cuts to the WPA FAP budget. For her art, she traveled to Lanceford, Pennsylvania to create prints and etchings of the coal miners. Grambs' work reflected her political leanings and commitment to social reform. She married Hugh \\"Lefty\\" Miller, and they moved to Paris together. Shortly after their arrival, war broke out, and they moved back to New York, where she continued to work as an artist. Her later work included contributing illustrations to over 30 children's books and in Woman's Day magazine. Grambs' work is held in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Smithsonian American Art Museum.

Club career Nicknamed \\"El Duende\\" (\\"the elf\\") due to his short height (he is 1.64 m tall), P√©rez was a talented forward who played primarily on the left wing. He began his professional career with Comunicaciones in the late 1970s, and would go on to become one of the symbols of that club. He helped Comunicaciones win the 1978 CONCACAF title as he scored a goal against CD Once Municipal in the 3-1 victory in the first leg of the first round of the tournament. He also had stints with Municipal, Galcasa, Suchitep√©quez, Once Lobos of El Salvador, Aurora F.C., and Deportivo Jalapa. In 1988 his services were required by the then Mexican top-flight club Leones Negros de la U. de G., where he played during the 1988-89 season. His team reached the final of the 1988-89 domestic cup tournament, where he scored a goal against Toluca in the second leg, although U. de G. lost 2-3 on aggregate. National team In 1979, P√©rez was a member of the U-23 national squad that won the II Uni√≥n Centroamericana youth tournament. As a member of the senior national team, he participated at the 1983 Pan American Games, winning the bronze medal, and later played during the 1986, 1990, and 1994 World Cup qualifying processes, scoring three goals in nine World Cup qualification matches. A tough moment came during 1986 World Cup qualification when against Canada with the score 2-1 in favor of the Canadians, he missed a penalty kick, which would have equalized the score and given his team a good chance of advancing to the next round. Instead, Canada advanced by finishing first of the group, two points ahead of Guatemala. P√©rez was also a member of the squad that competed at the 1988 Olympic Tournament in Seoul, Korea, where he played all three matches. Coaching career Following his retirement, P√©rez became a coach, managing several clubs, including Xinabajul, whom he led to win the 2007 Primera Divisi√≥n de Ascenso Apertura championship which gave the team the right to fight for a promotion spot into the Liga Nacional the following year. He also managed Deportivo Heredia in the top flight (2008), Juventud Retalteca (2008), San Pedro (2010), and Sacachispas (2011).

He is a left-handed red ball specialist who represents the country in both Tests and ODIs, and plays first-class cricket for the Sinhalese Sports Club. Karunaratne is the opening batsman for Sri Lanka in Test cricket. Since 2015, Karunaratne has become the leading batsman for Sri Lanka in Tests due to his century making in the second innings of Test matches. He was described as second- innings specialist by many commentators. He scored four centuries in the second innings out of the six centuries he made until October 2017. On 7 October 2017, Karunaratne became the second Sri Lankan opener after Tillakaratne Dilshan to score three Test centuries in a calendar year. In February 2019, he was named as the captain of Sri Lanka's Test squad for their series against South Africa. In April 2019, Sri Lanka Cricket named Dimuth Karunaratne as the team's new One Day International captain ahead of the 2019 Cricket World Cup, replacing Lasith Malinga. He is the only batsman after Ridley Jacobs to carry his bat in a Cricket World Cup. Personal life Karunaratne attended the St Joseph's College Colombo, which has produced a number of Sri Lankan test cricketers such as Angelo Mathews and Chaminda Vaas. He was a record-breaking batsman for the school's cricket team. After featuring in Sri Lanka's Under-19 and A squads, he was called into the senior One Day International (ODI) team for the series against England and Scotland in June and July 2011. He played in two matches on the tour, scoring four runs against England in Manchester, and 60 against Scotland in Edinburgh. He was selected in Sri Lanka's Test squad for its tour of South Africa at the end of 2011, although did not play in any of the three Tests. In March 2018, he was named as the captain of Dambulla's squad for the 2017‚Äì18 Super Four Provincial Tournament. The following month, he was also named in Dambulla's squad for the 2018 Super Provincial One Day Tournament. In August 2018, he was named as the vice-captain of Galle's squad the 2018 SLC T20 League. In February 2019, he signed for Hampshire County Cricket Club as their overseas player for the first half of the 2019 season. International career Early days He was recalled into the Test squad for the home Tests against New Zealand during late 2012. He got the opportunity due to Tillakaratne Dilshan being unable to make the XI because of an injury. He debuted in the first Test in that series, in Galle, only to get out for a duck in the first innings. However, he came back strongly in the 2nd innings with an unbeaten half century and hit the winning runs as well. Following the New Zealand series he was called into the test squad which was to tour Australia for a three test match series. During the first two tests in that series he failed to have an impact as he struggled against the Australian pace attack. In the final test of the series in Sydney he managed to get his highest test score of 85 in the second innings. His maiden century came against New Zealand on 28 December 2014 at Hagley Oval, Christchurch. He scored 152 runs from 363 balls in the second match of the series, where Sri Lanka in deep trouble of even draw the match. Eventually, Sri Lanka lost the match. He was picked to the original squad of 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup, but during a practice match, he broke a bone in his right hand and was removed from the team after the match against England. Kusal Perera replaced Dimuth. His second Test hundred came against Pakistan in Kandy; he scored 133 runs in first innings of the third match of the series. As his first Test century became waste, nothing different in this time. Sri Lanka lost the match by 7 wickets. Consistent opener His highest score in Test cricket was recorded during the first Test against West Indies in 2015 at Galle. He scored magnificent 186 runs and unfortunately got out in bowling of Marlon Samuels. He with Dinesh Chandimal, who also scored a century, recorded the highest partnership for the third wickelt at Galle, by scoring 238 runs. Sri Lanka easily defeated West Indies by an innings and 5 runs. Karunaratne showed very poor performance at home against Australia. He was trapped lbw and caught five times to Mitchell Starc in the first over of the each innings. He only scored 41 runs in three matches, including five single- digit scores, at average of 6.83 in six innings against Australia. Despite his poor performance, Sri Lanka whitewashed Australia 3‚Äì0 for the first time. Karunaratne was named captain of the A team for the first two four-day games at home against West Indies A. He scored 131 in first innings and 39* in second innings, guides Sri Lanka A to seven-wicket win. This strong comeback gave him to name for the Test team for Zimbabwe tour in late October 2016. Permanent opener in Tests During the first innings of the first Test against Zimbabwe, Karunaratne scored a fifty and in second innings scored his fourth Test century. Sri Lanka finally won the match by 225 runs. In the second Test, he scored 88 runs in the second innings, guided Sri Lanka to post impossible chasing to Zimbabwe. With impressive bowling by skipper Rangana Herath, Sri Lanka won the match by 257 runs, and whitewashed the series 2‚Äì0. Karunaratne won player of the series for his batting performance, scored 280 runs at an average of 70.00. He took his maiden Test wicket by dismissing Indian batsman Cheteshwar Pujara during the second test at SSC. In the second innings of the same match, he scored his fifth test century on 6 August 2017 against India and had a century partnership with Kusal Mendis. However, his century did not change the results for Sri Lanka, where they lost the match by an innings and 53 runs. This was the first time that India won a test match by an innings against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka lost all three matches against India in that series. Sri Lanka played their first day-night Test on 6 October 2017 at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium against Pakistan. In the match, Karunatane scored mighty innings of 196 and Sri Lanka scored 400+ in their first innings. With that, Karunaratne became the first Sri Lankan to score 50, 100 and 150 in a day-night Test as well. He fell just short 4 runs away by the double century, when Karunaratne poked at a short delivery that came back slightly off the seam and the ball took his inside edge, hit his thigh pad, and clattered into his stumps. However, in the second innings, Sri Lanka were all out for just 96 runs. With the help of bowling department, Sri Lanka won the match by 68 runs after a thrilling finish in the fifth day. For his batting performances throughout the Test series, Karunaratne was adjudged both Man of the match of second match and Player of series awards. During the first innings of second Test against India, Karunaratne completed 1000 Test run in a year 2017 with the average of 42.41. He was the second batsman to get to 1000 Test runs in 2017, after South African opener Dean Elgar. He was the seventh Sri Lankan to score 1000 Test runs in a calendar year as well. In May 2018, he was one of 33 cricketers to be awarded a national contract by Sri Lanka Cricket ahead of the 2018‚Äì19 season. On 12 July 2018 during first test against South Africa, Karunaratne played his 50th test match. He celebrated the match with a magnificent century. He scored unbeaten 158 runs, and became the fourth batsman for Sri Lanka to carry his bat in Tests after Sidath Wettimuny, Marvan Atapattu and Russell Arnold. He also became the third Sri Lankan after Sanath Jayasuriya and Tillakaratne Dilshan to have made a hundred in their 50th Test. Sri Lanka won the match within three day, where South Africa was dismissed to their lowest team total since readmission. Karunaratne scored 60 runs in the second innings, which is also the highest score in the innings for Sri Lanka. During the match, Karunaratne scored 218 runs, while South Africa made a combined total of 199 in the both innings. He was the only man to score more than 50 runs in the match, where all other 21 players did not scored more than 40s. Due to his high class match winning performances, he won the man of the match award. He continued the best form in the second test as well, where he scored fifties in the both innings for Sri Lanka with 53 and 85 respectively. Eventually, Sri Lanka won the second test by 199 runs and sealed the series 2-0. Due to his impressive batting performance throughout the series, he won the man of the match award and player of the series award. For his performances in 2018, he was named in the World Test XI by the ICC and ESPNCricinfo.https://www.icc-cricket.com/media- releases/980936http://www.espncricinfo.com/review2018/content/story/1169902.html Blow to head 2019 During the second Test at Canberra, suffered a blow to the back of the neck when he failed to get out of the way of a 142 km/h Pat Cummins bouncer. He laid almost motionless as medical staff inspected and eventually stretchered him off the field, for medical attention. Both Sri Lankan physio and Australian physio came to the field for the support. He was rushed to the hospital for further tests. Following medical assessments, he was released from the hospital in late evening of Saturday and cleared to bat again. Next day, after Kusal Perera got injured by another bouncer from Jhye Richardson, Karunaratne came to the field to play his innings. He reached his 22nd test fifty and got out for 59 runs. In the second innings, he only scored 8 runs and Sri Lanka lost the match and the series 2-0. Golden captaincy Due to poor performances throughout New Zealand and Australia tours, Chandimal was dropped from the Test squad for South Africa tour. Karunaratne was named as the stand-in captain for the tour, while Chandimal was released to play domestic cricket and regain his form with the bat. On 13 February 2019, Karunaratne became the 17th Test captain for Sri Lanka. Under his captaincy, Sri Lanka won the match by 1 wicket courtesy of Kusal Perera's unbeaten century. In the match, during South Africa's first innings, an apparent DRS timing error cost Sri Lanka a wicket of Hashim Amla. Vishwa Fernando rapped Amla on the pads for a confident appeal for lbw. Umpire Aleem Dar was unmoved, and after a short discussion Sri Lanka captain Karunaratne asked for a review - but Dar turned down the request on the basis that the visitors had taken too long to ask for it. However commentators confirmed that it took only 13 seconds when Karunaratne asked for the review. Sri Lanka won the second match at Port Elizabeth comfortably to seal the series 2-0. This was Sri Lanka's fourth consecutive win over South Africa as well. With this win, Sri Lanka became the first Asian team to win a Test series in South Africa and third overall after England and Australia. In March 2019, Karunaratne was arrested over a drink-drive incident in Colombo, which injured another motorist, and was later released on bail. He was fined, with Sri Lanka Cricket taking no further action on the incident. The following month, he was named as the captain of Sri Lanka's squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. His maiden tour as ODI captain came through Scotland tour in 2019 prior to the World Cup. First ODI was washed out due to rain. However, in the second ODI, he scored his maiden ODI fifty by scoring 77 runs. Sri Lanka posted 321 in 50 overs and finally Scotland bowled out for 199. Sri Lanka won the match by 35 runs in DLS method. On 1 June 2019, in Sri Lanka's first match of the Cricket World Cup, Karunaratne became the second cricketer to carry his bat in a World Cup match. Sri Lanka finished the tournament as sixth in the table with 3 wins, 4 losses and 2 abandoned matches. In the first Test match against New Zealand in August 2019, Karunaratne scored a match winning century in the fourth innings to chase down a target of 267. This is the first time a team has successfully chased down a fourth-innings target of more than 100 in Galle Stadium as well. New Zealand posted 267 runs in their second innings to win the match, where Karunaratne along with Lahiru Thirimanne gave a strong opening partnership of 161 runs. This stand ranks as only the second instance where fourth innings of a Test match in Asia scored more than 150 run opening partnership. He is the third Sri Lankan opener to score a century in fourth innings after Kusal Mendis and Sanath Jayasuriya. Karunaratne won the man of the match award for his match winning performances. However, New Zealand won the second test at P. Sara oval to level the series 1-1.

It consists of a higher salinity branch and a lower salinity branch. It originates in the Weddell Sea and closely follows the sea floor as it flows out into the rest of the world's oceans. It is created mainly due to the high surface winds blowing off the Antarctic continent which helps cool and oxygenate it. It flows at a rate of 2 to 5 Sv and contributes to the overall flow of the AABW. Introduction The Weddell Sea plays an important role in the movement of the world's oceans. An important part of the Weddell Sea is Weddell Sea Bottom Water (WSBW). WSBW is a major contributor to Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). While WSBW is considered part of AABW, the distinction comes in its potential temperature. The potential temperature of WSBW is -0.7 ¬∞C. At this temperature, the potential temperature vs. salinity chart shows a sharp change in slope. The outflow of WSBW is influenced greatly by the Scotia Ridge. The movement of WBSW is listed as 16 Sv which contributes to a total 97 Sv outflow of AABW. 2 to 5 Sv of this production is newly formed bottom water off the Antarctic coast.Carmack, Eddy C. and Foster, Theodore D., On the Flow of Water out of the Weddell Sea, Deep- Sea Research, 1975, Vol. 22, pp. 711 to 724. Pergamon Press. Printed in Great Britain. Formation The Weddell Sea is characterized by a cyclonic gyre bounded on the south by the Antarctic continent, on the west by the Antarctic Peninsula, on the north by the Scotia Ridge, and extending as far east as 20 to 30¬∞E. The precursor to bottom water formation is derived from the broad continental shelf west of 40¬∞W where brine released during sea-ice formation produces a large reservoir of cold (0 to - 1.8 ¬∞C), high salinity (S ‚â• 34.62 psu) shelf water. This water mass then mixes with a modified form of Warm Deep Water near the edge of the continental shelf to form a dense layer of bottom water, which in turn sinks along the continental slope and flows cyclonically around the western and northern perimeter of the Weddell Sea basin. Because large quantities of the high salinity water are observed on the continental shelf even during summer, bottom water may form throughout the year. Weddell Sea Bottom Water exhibits two forms: a low-salinity, better oxygenated component confined to the outer rim of the Weddell Gyre, and a more saline, less oxygenated component observed farther into the gyre. The more saline WSBW is derived from the southwestern Weddell Sea, where high salinity shelf water is abundant. The less saline WSBW, like the more ventilated Weddell Sea Deep Water (WSDW), is derived from lower-salinity shelf water at a point farther north along the Antarctic Peninsula. It is important to distinguish between AABW and a subclass of this water mass, WSBW. WSBW is characterized by lower potential temperatures and larger near-bottom temperature gradients, suggesting recent formation in the southwestern and western Weddell Sea. As this bottom water spreads from its region of sinking, it eventually mixes with the warmer and more saline water above to form AABW. Along the Scotia Ridge- Cape Norvegia section, potential temperature values at depths greater than range from -0.94 to -0.63 ¬∞C, while salinity values range from 34.639 to 34.652 psu. The northern limit of the core of Weddell Sea Bottom Water lies against the southern edge of the Scotia Ridge, suggesting that the circulation and property distributions are strongly influenced by bathymetry. Transport The transport of Weddell Sea Bottom Water out of the Weddell Sea represents the outflow of newly formed bottom water plus entrained bottom water that enters the Weddell Sea from the southeast. Carmack and Foster estimated the production rate of bottom water from the mixing ratio of newly formed bottom water to entrained bottom water. Bottom water formation models based on hydrographic observations suggested that the bottom water formed at the edge of the continental shelf has an initial temperature of -1.4 to -1.2 ¬∞C. This range also represents the coldest bottom water observed at the base of the continental slope in the northwestern corner of the Weddell Sea. The fraction of newly formed bottom water in the outflowing WSBW ranges from about 12 to 31%, so the flow of newly formed bottom water out of the Weddell Sea is about 2 to 5 Sv. On the other hand, the much larger production rates sometimes proposed are probably estimates of the total transport of bottom water out of the Weddell Sea that include a large fraction of Antarctic Bottom Water entering the Weddell Sea from the southeast. The low-salinity, better ventilated forms of WSDW and WSBW flowing along the outer rim of the Weddell Gyre have the position and depth range that would lead to overflow of the topographic confines of the Weddell Basin, whereas the more saline forms may be forced to recirculate within the Weddell Gyre are carried by the western boundary current of the Weddell Sea into the northwest corner of the Weddell Gyre. From there, these water masses flow eastward, either within the northern limb of the Weddell Gyre or reaching northward into the Scotia Sea, eventually cooling the lower 2 km of the world ocean as Antarctic Bottom Water. It is proposed that the more saline, lower-oxygen WSBW is derived from shelf water descending into the deep ocean in the southwest Weddell Sea. The higher salinity of this WSBW is due to injection of high-salinity shelf water characteristic of the region. Fahrbach et al. propose that low-salinity bottom water is formed near the Larsen Ice Shelf. Climate impacts McKee et al., conducted a study of the variability of bottom water temperature relative to El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Southern Annular Mode (SAM), and Antarctic Dipole (ADP). This study was conducted to discover the impact WSBW has on the global climate. An 8-year time study of the potential temperature of the Weddell Gyre outflow was analyzed. Interannual variability was discovered in the winters of 1999 and 2002. The anomalies suggest ENSO influence with a 14-20 month lead time with influences from SAM at 14-20 month lead times as well. Warm ENSO events cause the increase of sea ice advection and more coastal polynyas which allows for more dense shelf water availability. These ENSO and SAM changes impact the WSBW 14‚Äì20 months later. Their research suggests that there needs to be large ENSO and SAM events in order for the anomalies in WSBW temperature can be noticed. These large fluctuations allow for warm and cold pulses in the WSBW. With a strong ENSO event, sea ice is greatly reduced during the summer which exposes more surface water to the wind allowing it sink. This makes the WSBW colder than normal allowing it to inject colder water into much of the world's oceans. If the ENSO even is weak enough, the surface winds off the Antarctic coast can shift direction which creates a reduction in shelf water. This will warm the WSBW as it does not have as much access to the cold, dense surface water.McKee, Darren C., Yuan, Xiaojun, Gordon, Arnold L., Huber, Bruce A., and Dong, Zhaoqian, Climate impact on interannual variability of Weddell Sea Bottom Water, Journal of Geophysical Research, Vol. 116, C05020, , 2011 References Environment of Antarctica Water masses Geology of the Southern Ocean ","title":"Weddell Sea Bottom Water"},{"id":"34094564","text":"Dusk is a marble sculpture by Michelangelo, datable to 1524‚Äì1534.

The 2007 Eastbourne Borough Council election took place on 3 May 2007 to elect members of Eastbourne Borough Council in East Sussex, England. The whole council was up for election and the Liberal Democrats gained overall control of the council from the Conservative party. Background After the 2006 election the Conservatives controlled the council with a majority of 3, with 15 seats, compared to 12 for the Liberal Democrats. For 2007 the council changed from the previous system whereby a third of the council was elected each year, to instead have the whole council elected every 4 years, after a unanimous vote by the council. Earlier in 2007 Norman Marsh left the Liberal Democrats to sit as an independent, while Liberal Democrat Irene Sims resigned from the council. A record 89 candidates stood at the election, up from the previous high of 81 in 2002 when the entire council was last elected. Both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats stood a full 27 candidates, compared to 12 for Labour, 9 Green Party and 5 UK Independence Party. Councillors standing down at the election included Conservatives Patrick Bowker and David Stevens, Liberal Democrat Robert Slater and independent Norman Marsh. Election result The Liberal Democrats made 9 gains to take control of the council from the Conservatives for the first time since 2004, with 8 of the gains being from the Conservatives. The Liberal Democrats gained seats in Old Town, Sovereign and Upperton wards to hold 20 seats and have a majority of 13, while the Conservatives were reduced to 7 seats. The Conservatives losses included the leader of the council, Ian Lucas, in Old Town and the cabinet member for finance, Chris Williams, in Sovereign. Overall turnout at the election was 42.26%, compared to 40.70% in 2006. The Liberal Democrat victory was attributed to the introduction of parking charges in Eastbourne by Conservative controlled East Sussex County Council and to a decision by borough councillors to increase their expenses by 52%. Following the election David Tutt became the new leader of the council, while the national Liberal Democrat Menzies Campbell came to Eastbourne to celebrate the result.

Musical style and writing  The New York Times described the album's sound as \\"a kind of slow, pretty, gauzy metal, with highly managed guitar distortion, cathedral reverb and high, clear voices, except for when Neige sings in a barbed scream.\\" AllMusic's Thom Jurek described the album as combining \\"black metal's buzz, gorgeous shoegaze melodies, ambient soundscapes, and post rock feedback\\", and as a synthesis of the styles of the previous two albums. He also notes that the aggressive elements are employed in a \\"celebratory manner\\", and that with the use of harsh, screamed vocals, \\"the melodic beauty of the guitars seems to open up that expression, ensuring balance.\\" Neige consciously rejected comparisons to black metal, arguing that \\"It is not correct to label me as black metal because I did a few screams. There is nothing in my music about hate or angriness.\\" In a number of interviews he has described it as the most progressive and ethereal Alcest album to date. He has also stated that on this album he was inspired by Yann Tiersen, Dead Can Dance, Summoning, and Burzum. Neige has described the album as a continuation of his effort to describe his experiences of \\"another world\\" in visions as a child, and as \\"an attempt to explore this very strange esoteric experience.\\" Les Voyages is inspired by these even more than any previous album, with Neige saying that \\"The goal of this album was to push the concept of the band to the maximum. All the lyrics are very clear this time because before I was speaking about this but taking other directions to avoid that stuff. But the lyrics of the new album are really speaking about this and nothing else.\\" Though the songwriting process for this album was quicker than on previous albums, it was also the most challenging for Neige. He explained that \\"I really wanted to make something good. I want to push further the limits of this music, and for me, this is the end of an era. This album is the summary of what I've done before. The concept has been pushed to a different level than before, and that's why it sounds so other-worldly and dreamy, I think. It's complex and very progressive in a way. I think it's very melodic, and I spent a lot of time in the melodies to find good riffs.\\" He noted the title track as the most difficult song to compose, particularly structurally, adding that \\"I did six or seven versions of this song to find the right structure. I didn't spent a lot of time on the melodies for this one, but just on the structure, to find a way to gather all the riffs.\\"  Touring and promotion  Les voyages de l'√¢me (music video) Alcest began streaming the album in full online on January 4, 2012, two days in advance of the album's official release date. The band toured across Europe for much of early 2012 in support of the album, and in September 2012 they played in Nagoya, Osaka, and Tokyo in Japan for the first time. A music video directed by Julien Marie for the song 'Autre Temps' was released on December 1, 2011. Neige was very involved in the direction of the video, saying that \\"I gave him the directions. Where to go; what to speak about; what kind of images I wanted to have; casting. Pretty much everything had a direction. It‚Äôs not me who filmed the video; it‚Äôs him.\\" He discussed the concept behind the video, explaining that it's about \\"the contrast between the fact that nature is moving, changing but still is here and will always be here. And the humans are just going here and disappearing very, very quickly. So it‚Äôs very contrasted. But you can see many things. [...] And the ocean is the symbol of immortality in a way because life is the symbol of ‚Äî water is the symbol of life.\\" Following the release of the album, the band released a second video for the albums' title track on May 21, 2012. The video was directed, edited and written by Toshadeva Palani.  Critical reception  Upon its initial release, Les Voyages de l'√Çme was met with very positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic (a review aggregator site which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 from music critics), based on 10 critics, the album has received a score of 82, which indicates \\"universal acclaim\\". Exclaim! critic Natalie Zina Walschots wrote a positive review of the album, concluding that \\"The music contains all of the trembling beauty fans have come to expect from Alcest, combined with a sense of vitality and wanderlust. Les Voyages De L'√Çme explores rather than pleads.\\" They noted that where the previous album was very melancholic, Les Voyages... is characterised \\"by a strong forward movement and breathless, buoying optimism\\". Thom Jurek wrote a positive review of the album for AllMusic, writing that the album \\"is a conscious synthesis of the music from their two previous albums, rather than a move forward. And that's fine: assessment and integration and perfecting previous ideas are important aspects of any serious attempt at making art and creating a forward motion trajectory.\\" He praised the improved production quality, and that \\"its ability to create emotions that approach bliss in now part of its sonic architecture\\". Pitchfork contributor Brandon Stosuy wrote a more lukewarm review, writing that \\"There's no denying the beauty, but it feels weirdly muted-- or perhaps just unsurprising.\\" Stosuy nonetheless praised the album as \\"the most accomplished Alcest offering yet\\", noting the transition between \\"Beings of Light\\" and \\"Faiseurs de Mondes\\" as the standout moment. PopMatters writer Brice Ezell commended the band for continuing to elude efforts to be pigeonholed to a particular genre, stating \\"It‚Äôs clear from the group‚Äôs output thus far that Alcest isn‚Äôt trying to be a black metal band and, yet, for some reason, that genre is a consistent talking point in terms of the band‚Äôs overall output. If that‚Äôs the case, then Alcest could perhaps be called ‚Äúpost-black metal‚Äù. But given that the critical scene is already dense with superfluous and unnecessary genre names, I‚Äôll go ahead and forego the need to label the band in that fashion. Needless to say, the sound of Alcest is one that represents a wholly unique mixture of metal and shoegaze, and Les Voyages De L‚Äô√Çme is a masterful demonstration of that sonic equation.\\" Track listing Personnel Adapted from AllMusiccredits. ; Alcest * Neige ‚Äì lead and backing vocals, guitars, bass, keyboards * Winterhalter ‚Äì drums ; Additional personnel * Martin \\"MK\\" Koller - production * Neb Xort - mixing, mastering * Markus Stock - engineer * Fursy Teyssier ‚Äì cover art * Valnoir - design References External links * 2012 albums Alcest albums ","title":"Les Voyages de l'√Çme"},{"id":"34094755","text":"Stanley York (born August 29, 1931) is an American politician and minister.

It is now in the Bargello museum in Florence. The sculpture gives Brutus an heroic aspect in keeping with political sentiment against tyranny at the time of its creation. It belongs to‚Äîand may have initiated‚Äîa revival of the classical bust in sculpture.  Background  Michelangelo carved Brutus a few years after the defeat of the Republic of Florence (1527‚Äì1531). As a supporter of the Florentine Republic who designed and supervised the remodeling and construction of its fortifications, Michelangelo was a strong opponent of tyranny.Charles de Tolnay, Michelangelo: Sculptor, Painter, Architect (translated from French by Gaynor Woodhouse) (Princeton, NJ; Princeton University Press: 1975) pp. 43‚Äì45, 61‚Äì63, 173. In the Divine Comedy, Dante had placed Brutus among the lowest of the low. Michelangelo was much devoted to the poems of Dante but with the Renaissance, Brutus came to be seen as a strong and defiant opponent of tyranny. ‚ÄúDuring the Renaissance, with the Roman Empire seen as the beginning of the decadence of Rome, a veritable cult of Brutus developed,‚Äù Michelangelo biographer Charles de Tolnay writes. During the years following the capitulation of Florence, Michelangelo remained in contact with some of the former leaders of the Republic, men who championed the liberty of the city-state and opposed Medician tyranny. De Tolnay believes that one of these men, namely Donato Giannotti, inspired the bust of Brutus. \\"The Bust is important for understanding [Michelangelo] Buonarroti‚Äôs political views,\\" De Tolnay states. ‚ÄúMichelangelo‚Äôs conception of Brutus is clearly expressed in this bust: It represents heroic scorn for those who would destroy liberty.‚Äù Contemporaries may have connected the sculpture with the assassination of Alessandro de' Medici, Duke of Florence, by Lorenzino de' Medici in 1537. Johannes Wilde, another lifetime Michelangelo scholar, also sees the Brutus as a ‚Äúglorification of liberty from tyranny.‚Äù Wilde suggests the sculpture remained unfinished.Johannes Wilde, Michelangelo: Six Lectures (Oxford, UK; Oxford University Press, 1978) p. 9.  Date  Brutus viewed from the side, looking into the face. De Tolnay suggests the bust was created around 1539‚Äì1540. The National Museum of Bargello in Florence, where the statue is usually displayed, also dates the work to 1539‚Äì1540National Museum of Bargello, accessed 4 November 2017. Thomas Martin questions this date, which originates with Giorgio Vasari, noting that Brutus did not leave Michelangelo's workshop until about 1555 and suggesting that the sculpture might have been crafted over a long period, perhaps commissioned to commemorate the death of Lorenzino de' Medici in 1548.\\"Michelangelo's 'Brutus' and the Classicizing Portrait Bust in Sixteenth-Century Italy\\", Artibus et Historiae 14(27), 1993; JSTOR. The sculpture is generally considered influential in reviving the classical bust form in sculpture. In Martin's view, however, the later dates of the sculpture make it a later comer to the trend. Brutus is compared with a marble bust of Duke Cosimo I created by Bartolommeo Bandinelli in 1543‚Äì1545 and another bust of Duke Cosimo created by Benvenuto Cellini in 1545‚Äì1547.  The work  The sculpture was commissioned by the republican Donato Giannotti for Cardinal Niccol√≤ Ridolfi. The face of the sculpture is asymmetrical, with the side turned away from the spectator showing more signs of emotion, including a flared nostril.  Fibula as a study for the head  Comparison of fibula on Brutus's shoulder with classical depiction of Brutus on a coin Giorgio Vasari wrote that Michelangelo had modeled Brutus from the image cut into a gem. Later scholars did not find the sculpture to resemble any such extant gem, supposing instead that the sculpture may have been modeled after a bust of Caracalla.Irving Lavin, \\"On Illusion and Allusion in Italian Sixteenth-Century Portrait Busts\\", Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 119(5), October 15, 1975; JSTOR. De Tolnay in 1935 published his observation that the fibula in the sculpture is a study for the sculpture itself, providing a missing link to show the resemblance to classical coinage.Charles Tolnay, \\"Michelangelo's Bust of Brutus\\", The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs 67(338), July 1935; JSTOR. The shape of the head itself is simpler than that of the silhouette on the shoulder. According to de Tolnay: > In the former (the fibula), the silhouette of the head is roundish ; the > forehead in relief shows movement ; the outline of the nose is undulating ; > the line of the lips is soft ; the chin is sharply rounded. In the latter > (the bust), everything is simplified for cutting ; the comparatively small > head rises above an unusually broad bull-neck, and has an almost straight > rectangular silhouette ; the forehead is quite smoothed off ; the nose is > severely straight ; the lips are hard ; the chin is angular and protruding. > The minor details have disappeared and only the form as a whole remains > effective. This evolution from an empirical, individual prototype to a > universal, ideal type is characteristic of Michelangelo's procedure, and may > be seen even in his early work.

It now stands in the Bargello museum in Florence. History Rear view. Photo by Paolo Monti, 1981) The statue had been commissioned for the private palace of Baccio Valori when the fierce governor was imposed on Florence by Clement VII after recovery of the city from a protracted siege. Work on the sculpture stopped shortly after Alessandro de' Medici was made duke and Michelangelo left the city. The sculpture then entered the collection of Duke Cosimo I. It was placed in his private quarters along with a \\"Bacchus\\" of Baccio Bandinelli, a work of Andrea Sansovino, and an old \\"Ganymede\\" that had been restored by Benvenuto Cellini. Hallmarks of his style and methods exist on the unfinished work that support the attribution of the statue to Michelangelo. The subject of the unfinished statue was never noted by Michelangelo, however, and contemporary historical sources disagree about the subject. According to Vasari it is an \\"Apollo\\", perhaps in the act of taking an arrow from a quiver. In the inventory of Cosimo I of 1553, however, it is identified as, \\"David\\", by whoever drew up the historic catalogue. Art critics therefore identify the sculpture as one or the other, or, by showing a hyphenated title, \\"Apollo-David\\" or \\"David- Apollo\\", to note the uncertainty. Factors favoring the identity as Apollo are: the body is stocky and mature, as Apollo often was portrayed, rather than the typical portrayal of a youthful David; no bow is represented in the carving and, no unfinished portion of the statue allows enough area for one. Conjecture exists that the sculptor had started the work as David, perhaps toward 1525, and later finished it as Apollo. There also are those who have attempted to identify the work as the lost Apollo Cupid (Valentinier, 1958), carved in 1537 by Jacopo Galli in Rome. When Cosimo came into possession of the collection containing the most important statues of Michelangelo (the Bacchus or the Genius of Victory), the Apollo-David was placed in the Boboli Gardens, where it decorated a long niche of its amphitheater. In 1824 the statue was transported to the Uffizi, and later placed into the collection at the Bargello. Now it is in the National Gallery of Art Museum, part of the Renaissance wing complete with European paintings and sculptures. Description related to style and subject The work depicts a naked man and, apart from the enigmatic subject, the sculpture is made particularly complex via the use of versus twist, which shows the body's contours in depth, multiplying the points of view. Arms and legs are set to play an effective correlation with some joints bent and the opposite being flat. For example, the left arm is bent and stretched the right, and the right leg is extended and the left is bent over an unfinished structure on the ground. Some declare that the structure was intended to become the head of Goliath. Behind the figure is a tree trunk, which essentially, is static and has a function of support for the whole statue. Another unfinished portion of the marble extends upward along its back from the waist. The strong movement of the head to the left is contrasted by the extreme straightness of the right arm (not shown in the photograph displayed to the right). From another angle (displayed), the left arm isolates the upper body from the lower, generating a characteristically dynamic effect that is taught to art students as creating, mannerism. If considered as a \\"David\\" rather than an \\"Apollo\\", the statue presents a striking difference from the more famous, athletic and youthful figure in the Piazza della Signoria by the same sculptor. Instead of displaying the potential force and inward wrath of the biblical hero, it reads as almost melancholy or remorseful for his bloody action against Goliath if that be his head, perhaps revealing all consequences of the action. Another interpretation is that the pose could express a veiled, but deep animosity by the sculptor against the conquerors of Florence,Heusinger, cit., pg. 303. although work on the statue stopped with the change.

It was built between St Peter's Square and Lloyd Street in Manchester city centre, England. English Heritage designated it a grade II* listed building on 3 October 1974. Its eclectic style was designed to be a link between the ornate Gothic Revival Manchester Town Hall and the Classical architecture of the Central Library. Architecture The refurbished Rates Hall in 2014 The Town Hall Extension, housing municipal departments including rates, rents and street cleaning departments, was built after a competition in 1927 was won by E. Vincent Harris who, in the same year, won a competition to build Manchester Central Library on an adjacent site. The building, built by J. Gerrard & Sons Ltd of Swinton, is essentially Gothic in character, with ornately carved tracery and a steeply pitched roof interpreted in a contemporary style. The building was started after the Central Library was completed and originally had a rates hall, gas and electricity showrooms on the ground floor; a cinema was built at basement level and on the first floor is a council chamber. The building cost ¬£750,000 and was opened by King George VI in 1938, the occasion commemorated by a carved inset stone at the Mount Street end. The building is linked to Manchester Town Hall by two covered bridges at first-floor level over Lloyd Street and has an irregular plan with a concave south side facing the Central Library. Its curved four-storey range with round-headed arches and small windows facing Library Walk is 200 feet in length. The eight-storey building has attics and a basement. It was constructed with a steel frame clad in ashlar sandstone from Darley Dale and a steeply pitched slate roof. The Lloyd Street facade has 29 windows, five of which are set back and its seventh and eighth storeys are set behind a parapet. The 17-window facade to St Peter's Square has small rectangular windows up to the parapet and two-light mullioned windows to the sixth and seventh floors, and its attic dormers have hipped roofs and wooden cross-windows. Along these facades, on the ground floor, is a continuous arcade of plain round-headed openings and a chamfered coping. The upper floors on the Lloyd Street and St Peter's Square facades have a horizontal band over the first floor. The Mount Street facade has five large oriel windows filled with mullion-and-transom windows. The gable ends on Mount Street and St Peter's Square have stair-turrets with round-headed arches containing windows with geometric tracery. Above them are niches with statues. Its stained-glass windows representing Lancastrian coats of arms were designed by George Kruger Gray. Charles Reilly, a contemporary architecture critic, thought the extension was 'dull' and 'drab' while Nikolaus Pevsner considered it was Harris's 'best job'. Refurbishment Manchester City Council restored and refurbished the Town Hall Extension and the Central Library from 2010‚Äì15 to include a public service hub to make its services more accessible. The public entrances on Mount Street and St Peter's Square were restored to their 1930s appearance and staircases to the lower ground floor were reinstated to access the Central Library which was extended into the basement. The rates hall was restored. The project, delivered by Laing O'Rourke, won the Construction News Judges Supreme Award in June 2015. It was described as an almost impossibly complex project completed on schedule and within budget.

She studied art at the Art Students League in New York City and Cooper Union. At Cooper Union, she received a traveling scholarship to Europe for three years where she studied at Fontainebleau and created several frescoes in Paris and Montereau. After returning to the United States, she produced several large public art projects, most notably the fresco mural at the Mount Vernon Library in Mount Vernon, NY based on a Goebelin tapestry, The Lady and the Unicorn. The four panels were commissioned by the Federal Art Project and created between 1937 and 1938. Other works include \\"Vocal Music\\" at the Wood Auditorium in Mount Vernon; a decorative frieze in the Hotel Belvedere in New York City; and a mural at the Nichols Junior High School auditorium. In 1940, she married Wayne Amsden Soverns, a New York architect. They resided in Mount Vernon and Larchmont, New York, until her death in 1982. Her later works were painted under the name Louise Soverns.  The Mount Vernon Fresco  The Mount Vernon Public Library fresco was one of the largest ever undertaken by the Federal Art Project. It circles an entire room that is 30 feet by 34 feet. The fresco covers 1080 square feet of wall. It required 16 months to complete, with the artist completing about one square foot per day. The work was completed in time for a grand opening of a new library addition during October, 1938. The fresco is divided into four main sections, reflecting education, occupation, diversion, and recreation. The artist drew inspiration from the Lady and the Unicorn tapestries in the Cluny Museum in Paris and from other fifteenth century tapestries. In 1966, with financial backing from the New York State Council on the Arts and others, the artist completed a restoration of the project, including replacing some damaged mortar and rejuvenating some of the paint, especially the reds. 800x800px  Other Public Art Projects  1931 Fresco in chapel of Sacre Couer in Montereau, France 1932-33 Frescoes in the American and Belgian Foundations of the Cite Universitaire, Paris 1934 - Four mural panels, each 14'6\\" x 7'8\\", in the auditorium of Nichols Junior High School, Mount Vernon, NY 1940 - \\"Vocal Music\\" mural, 18' high x 4' wide, honoring Theodore Von Yorx in Wood Auditorium, Mount Vernon, NY 1940 - Two murals in the Entrance Hall of Davis High School, Mount Vernon, NY 1942 - Mural painting, on wooden screen 3' high x 6' wide, for display in a United States Navy training station and winner of a competition resulting in being displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. 1948 - \\"Palmer\\" mural, 18' high by 4' wide, honoring Jasper T.

United States 1792 contract rifles are Pennsylvania- Kentucky Rifles with a 42-inch octagon barrel in .49 caliber, with a patch box built into the buttstock. What distinguishes them from civilian rifles is that they were bought by the government under military contract. History Before the United States military used standardized weapons with interchangeable parts, it bought rifles that are difficult to distinguish from their civilian equivalent. The process was similar to today, in which the government requests weaponry of certain specifications and then finds a manufacturer to build them. In 1792 there was a need for rifles, and a contract was drawn-up with Lancaster, Pennsylvania gunsmiths to deliver rifles. In January 1792, Henry Knox, the Secretary of War for the period, authorized former General Edward Hand to contract with manufacturers for the rifles. The rifles were to be delivered in units of 100 as quickly as possible. He told General Hand that the contract was for 500 rifles, but that he was willing to extend it to 1,000. The 1792 contract specified rifles with a 44 1/2 inch barrel in .47 caliber. That was modified to a 42-inch barrel in .49 caliber, with a well- seasoned maple stock and a flintlock with a fly. Eleven different gunsmiths took the contract on, delivering 1,476 rifles between April 1792 and December 1792. A second contract for the same weapon took place in 1794. Seventeen gunsmiths delivered 2,000 rifles by November 1794. These military- or militia- issued rifles were of civilian style, and it has been very difficult for collectors to identify them from this contract. However, the military issued them to regular troops and militias and called them back to the arsenals as needed. Edward Flanagan, who wrote a paper on the 1792 and 1807 contract rifles, stated that he believed that the weapons were marked by the US government, a lesson learned from gun thefts during the Revolutionary War. He pointed to a \\"US\\" stamp on the barrel of a weapon known to have been a contract rifle. A second contract rifle has been identified, the 1807 Contract Rifle, which has different specifications than the weapons of 1792 and 1794. Lewis and Clark Before their exploratory trip, the Lewis and Clark Expedition obtained rifles from the Harper's Ferry Arsenal. The US Army's website mentions the procurement of the rifles, saying that there were 300 of the 1792 or 1794 contract rifles at the arsenal at that time. The Army site also refers to modern speculation that the changes Lewis had made to the contract rifles (adding sling swivels, shortening the barrel further to 33-36 inches and reboring them to a larger caliber), led to the design of the US Model 1803, created six months later.

It sits in Columbus Square park. Dedicated in 1941, it is in bronze on a cast stone base. It depicts Christopher Columbus as a young, energetic explorer at the helm. The base the statue sits on suggests the prow of a ship. History As installed in Columbus Triangle The origins of the statue lie in the 1920s in the Italian-American community in Long Island and Astoria. It began raising money for the statue, but work stalled when the community couldn't afford a base. By 1930, the Board of Aldermen had renamed the park, on the east side of the Astoria Boulevard (BMT Astoria Line) station, Columbus Square. The statue was dedicated in 1941, but that year it provoked an argument between Queens Borough President George U. Harvey and Parks Commissioner Robert Moses. During World War II, the statue was removed and hidden on fears of being taken for war-use scrap metal. After some years in warehouses and the basement of Queens Borough Hall, it was reinstalled on its base.

In 1920, at age 16, he was hired as an artist's apprentice in a New York architectural sculpture studio. In the evenings from 1920 thru 1928 he studied at the Beaux Arts Institute of Design. Chartered in 1916, the Beaux Arts Institute had as its mission promotion of the Beaux-Arts architectural style and fostering of closer relationships between architects, muralists, and sculptors.Howlett, D. Rodger \\"Thirties Sculpture in the Manship Tradition Reborn in the Eighties\\" The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts, Vol. 16, Summer 1990, pgs. 22 - 27. In 1935, after fifteen years creating architectural sculpture, Lo Medico opened his own studio in New York City. The Great Depression made it difficult for young sculptors to cast and sell small works as collectors still financially in a position to purchase artwork tended to support recognized sculptors such as Paul Manship. At the same time, the New Deal created opportunities for lesser known sculptors to pursue commissions for federal contracts via anonymous competitions. Contracts to create art for Federal Buildings were being administered by the Department of Treasury's Section of Painting and Sculpture The section had been established in 1934 under Edward Bruce, Director of the Public Works of Art Project (PWAP) with a mission to discover new talent and provide work for unemployed artists. In 1936, Lo Medico was awarded a PWAP contract to execute plaster reliefs for the new Wilmington, North Carolina Post Office. He wrote \\"I wish to‚Ä¶praise the policy of the Section of Painting and Sculpture in granting freedom and liberal cooperation to the artists in the execution of their work.\\"Davis, Anita Price New Deal Art in North Carolina, The Murals, Sculptures, Reliefs, Paintings, Oils and Frescoes and Their Creators, McFarland & Co., Jefferson, NC, 2009, pgs. 201 ‚Äì 205. His seven 4.5-foot-high panels depicting scenes of North Carolina people, commerce, and history were collectively titled \\"History and Present Day Themes Relating to Wilmington and Its Surroundings\\". The individual panels are titled Stevedores, Fishing, Cotton Pickers, Chemists, The Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence, The Landing of the English on Roanoke Island, and Education. In 1939, Lo Medico executed a PWAP contract of a terracotta Potter to embellish the interior of the Crooksville, Ohio Post Office. In 1938, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company announced an $8000 prize for a sculptural group on the American Family intending to make it the centerpiece of their exhibit at the upcoming 1939 New York World's Fair. The competition attracted 257 entries and the winning entry was Family Group by Lo Medico. From the insurance company's perspective the 12-ft- high statue symbolized an average American family moving forward in life shielded from unforeseen hazards by insurance.\\"Exhibit Planned by Metropolitan\\" Macon Telegraph (Macon GA), December 17, 1938, p. 9.

Lo Medico designed his first medal in 1946 for the National Sculpture Society (NSS). The medal in honor of American sculptor Herbert Adams (1958 ‚Äì 1945) was created as an annual memorial (The Herbert Adams Memorial Award) to recognize individuals and organizations that have significantly encouraged and advanced American sculpture. Lo Medico continued to design new medals almost every year thereafter. He taught at the NY School of Industrial Art, and the National Academy of Design. In 1956, Lo Medico moved to Tappan, NY and constructed an art studio behind his house on Main St. where he continued to create sculpture and medals. He died at home on November 29, 1985 at age 81. He was survived by his wife Lenora Lisciandra Lo Medico. In 1993, his widow donated Lo Medico's papers including correspondence about commemorative medals, sculpture competitions, commissions, and financial records to Smithsonian Archives of American Art. Previous to this, in 1967 & 1971 Lo Medico donated photographs of his work to the Special Collections Research Center at Syracuse University Library.  Artistic controversy  On June 17, 1942 Lo Medico won a $1,000 first prize in a competition to design a public sculpture with the theme \\"Wings for Victory ‚Äì The Spirit of Aviation\\". The competition was sponsored by Artists for Victory, Inc., a consortium of twenty-three artists' organizations. The idea was to create a temporary outdoor sculpture that would promote patriotism and incentivize the purchase of War Bonds. Lo Medico submitted a one-third scale model of a 24-foot-high weather resistant plaster stature depicting a resolute looking WW II aviator in flight suit pulling on gloves. His entry was the unanimous choice of the eleven jurors from among 149 entries and the full size statue was expected to be displayed in a prominent public location.McCausland, Elizabeth \\"Sculptors Contribute to War Effort\\" Springfield Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts), June 28, 1942, p. 6E. The suggested location was in front of the NY Public Library at 42nd St. & 5th Ave. Contest results were announced at the Whitney Museum of American Art and Lo Medico's model along with those of the runners- up were placed on display in the museum entrance hall.\\"Lo Medico, Sculptor, Wins 'Wings for Victory' Prize\\" Springfield Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts), June 21, 1942, p. 6E.

He stated that he would not approve the statue's placement on any city owned property. The mayor was quoted in the press describing the statue as a \\"piece of second or third-rate art looking for a first-class controversy\\". Robert Moses, NYC Parks Commissioner concurred and opposed its display in any city park.\\"Controversy Over The 'Wings for Victory'\\" Springfield Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts), August 27, 1942, p. 11.

In 1980, nearly 40 years later, commenting on this incident, Lo Medico seemed to blame the media for creating the controversy: \\"I became a mildly notorious subject thanks to the newspapers. ‚Ä¶The sculpture was simply a dramatic rendition of a World War II aviator. It was 24-feet-high and, of course, it was going to be placed in one of the most prominent spots in New York City. That was the plan, but Mayor La Guardia, who was then the mayor of New York, for some reason said 'no'. That was it. The newspapers made quite a thing of it. And, of course, artists all over protested the mayor's decision.

He settled in Los Angeles, California in 1939 and proceeded to mainly create marble and bronze busts. He worked for 20th Century Fox until his death in 1958. Early life Alexander Finta was born in T√∫rkeve in Hungary on June 18, 1881. He obtained his diploma in mechanical engineering before moving to Budapest and Florence to study art. Finta then traveled to Paris, where he studied with Auguste Rodin. After serving in World War I, he created a number of war memorials. In 1917, he was appointed the \\"expert in art and archeology\\" by the Hungarian government. After the war, the Hungarian Democratic Republic was formed, and to escape internal conflict, Finta moved to Brazil in 1919. In Rio de Janeiro, Finta created many monuments, including Strength, a 12-foot granite statue for the Fluminenci Club. He also created Christ for the Old Cathedral of Rio de Janeiro. While still in Rio, Finta served as the director- in-chief for sculpture for the 1922‚Äì1923 Rio World's Fair. Life in the United States Alexander Finta in 1939 In 1923 Finta moved to New York City to escape the yellow fever outbreaks in Brazil. Seven years later, Finta would be a naturalized citizen. In New York, Finta would create the sculpture of Stephen I of Hungary which resides in St. Stephen of Hungary Church in New York City. The piece was created to commemorate the church's new location on the Upper East Side, which was completed in 1928. Finta would marry his second wife, Catherine, who was a painter and a professor of design. Her own work was shown at the Brooklyn Museum. In New York, Finta would have commissions from New York's Authors Club, the First Presbyterian Church, the Hungarian Reference Library, Cleveland Public Library, the city's Department of Health, and numerous public artworks within the region. He was also a book illustrator, poet, author and journalist. His most notable book, Herdsboy of Hungary: The True Story of Mocskos, was written with Jeanette Eaton.

Living systems can integrate the inputs from the senses to navigate in their environment and to coordinate posture, locomotion, and eye movements. Gravity has a fundamental role in controlling these functions. In weightlessness during spaceflight, integrating the sensory inputs and coordinating motor responses is harder to do because gravity is no longer sensed during free-fall. For example, the otolith organs of the vestibular system no longer signal head tilt relative to gravity when standing. However, they can still sense head translation during body motion. Ambiguities and changes in how the gravitational input is processed can lead to potential errors in perception, which affects spatial orientation and mental representation. Dysfunctions of the vestibular system are common during and immediately after spaceflight, such as space motion sickness in orbit and balance disorders after return to Earth. Adaptation to weightlessness involves not just the Sensory-motor coupling functions, but some autonomic nervous system functions as well. Sleep disorders and orthostatic intolerance are also common during and after spaceflight. There is no hydrostatic pressure in a weightless environment. As a result, the redistribution of body fluids toward the upper body causes a decrease in leg volume, which may affect muscle viscosity and compliance. An increase in intracranial pressure may also be responsible for a decrease in near visual acuity. In addition, muscle mass and strength both decrease as a result of the reduced loading in weightlessness. Moreover, approximately 70% of astronauts experience space motion sickness to some degree during the first days. The drugs commonly used to combat motion sickness, such as scopolamine and promethazine, have soporific effects. These factors can lead to chronic fatigue. The challenge of integrative space medicine and physiology is to investigate the adaptation of the human body to spaceflight as a whole, and not just as the sum of body parts because all body functions are connected and interact with each other. History of space neuroscience Space neuroscience is the scientific study of central nervous system functions during and after human spaceflight. To date, only three countries, the United States, Russia, and China, have the capability to launch humans into orbit. However, 520 astronauts from more than thirty different countries have flown in space and many of them have participated in space neuroscience research. The launch of the first living animal in orbit on Sputnik on November 3, 1957 marked the beginning of a rich history of unique scientific and technological achievements in space life sciences that have spanned more than fifty years to date. The first documented space neuroscience experiments were performed during the third human mission on board the Russian Vostok spacecraft. These experiments began after the crew from previous missions complained from nausea and spatial disorientation in weightlessness. Space neuroscience experiments typically addressed these operational issues until the Skylab and Salyut space stations were made available for more fundamental research on the effect of gravity on CNS functions. Approximately 400 space neuroscience experiments have been performed from Vostok-3 in August 1962 to the Expedition-15 on board the International Space Station in October 2007. Operational aspects Sensory and sensorimotor disturbances when arriving in low Earth orbit are well documented, the most known of these being space motion sickness (SMS). Individual differences, spacecraft size, and body movements cause SMS symptoms. Typically lasting the first three or four days of weightlessness, symptoms range from headaches and fatigue to nausea and vomiting. The consequences vary from simple discomfort to possible incapacitation, creating potential problems during extra-vehicular activity, re-entry, and emergency egress from the spacecraft. The body receives a variety of conflicting signals from the visual, somato-sensory, and vestibular organs in weightlessness. These conflicting inputs are thought to be the primary cause of SMS, but the precise mechanisms of the conflict are not well understood. Medications currently used to alleviate the symptoms produce undesirable side effects. Astronauts must remain alert and vigilant while operating complicated equipment. Therefore, getting enough sleep is a crucial factor of mission success. Weightlessness, a confined and isolated environment, and busy schedules coupled with the absence of a regular 24-hour day make sleep difficult in space. Astronauts typically average only about six hours of sleep each night. Cumulative sleep loss and sleep disruption could lead to performance errors and accidents that pose significant risk to mission success. Sleep and circadian cycles also temporally modulate a broad range of physiological, hormonal, behavioral, and cognitive functions. Methods to prevent sleep loss, reduce human error, and optimize mental and physical performance during long-duration spaceflight are being investigated. Particular concerns include the effect of the space environment on higher- order cognitive processes like decision-making and the impact of changing gravity on mental functions, which will be important if artificial gravity is considered as a countermeasure for future interplanetary space missions. It is also necessary to develop human-response measurement technologies to assess the crew's ability to perform flight-management tasks effectively. Simple and reliable behavioral and psycho-physiological response measurement systems are needed to assess mental loading, stress, task engagement, and situation awareness during spaceflight. Sensory functions in space All living organisms on Earth have the ability to sense and respond to changes in their internal and external environment. Organisms, including humans, must accurately sense before they can react, thus ensuring survival. The body senses the environment by specialized sensory organs. The CNS utilizes these sensations in order to coordinate and organize muscle activities, shift from uncomfortable positions, and adjust balance properly. In common speech, five different senses are usually recognized: vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. All these senses are somewhat affected by weightlessness. In fact, the human body has seven sensory systems ‚Äì not five. The sixth and seventh systems are the senses of motion located in the inner ear. The former signals the beginning and end of rotation and the latter signals body tilt relative to gravity as well as body translation. The seventh system no longer provides tilt information in weightlessness; however, it does continue to signal translation, so the afferent signals to the CNS are confusing. The experience of living and working in space alters the way the CNS interprets the otolith organ signals during linear acceleration. Although the perception is fairly accurate when subjects are exposed to angular acceleration in yaw in-flight, there are disturbances during angular rotation in pitch and roll, and during linear acceleration along the body transversal and longitudinal axes. Perception of body motion is also altered during the same motion immediately after landing. There is an adaptation to weightlessness in orbit that carries over to post-flight reactions to linear acceleration. Posture, movement, and locomotions Exposure to weightlessness causes changes to the signals from the receptors to touch, pressure, and gravity, i.e., all information necessary for postural stability. Adaptive modifications in the central processing of sensory information take place to produce motor responses that are appropriate for the new gravitational environment. As a result, terrestrial motor strategies are progressively abandoned in weightlessness, as astronauts adapt to the weightless environment. This is particularly true for the major postural muscles found in the lower legs. The modifications in posture, movement, and locomotion acquired in reduced gravity are then inappropriate for Earth's gravity upon return. After landing, postural instability approaching clinical ataxia is manifested as a result of this in-flight neural reorganization. Difficulties with standing, walking, turning corners, climbing stairs, and a slowing of gait are experienced as astronauts re-adapt to Earth's gravity, until terrestrial motor strategies are fully re-acquired. Adaptation to spaceflight also induces a significant increase in the time required to traverse an obstacle course on landing day, and recovery of functional mobility takes an average of two weeks. These difficulties can have adverse consequences for an astronauts‚Äô ability to stand up or escape from the vehicle during emergencies and to function effectively immediately after leaving the spacecraft after flight. Thus it is important to understand the cause of these profound impairments of posture and locomotion stability, and develop countermeasures. The most significant sensorimotor problems astronauts will face during a stay on the Moon and Mars are likely to occur when walking around in their space suits. The suits are big and bulky and change the body's center of gravity. This along with the uneven terrain and limited field of view makes locomotion challenging. Compensatory eye movements The function of the vestibular system during spaceflight is by far the most carefully studied of all. This is especially true of the gravity-sensing otolith organs and their relationship to eye movements. The vestibular semicircular canal function seems unchanged in weightlessness because the horizontal eye movements that compensated for head yaw rotation are not affected by spaceflight. The absence of gravity stimulation of the otoliths reduces the torsional vestibulo-ocular reflex during head roll rotation in microgravity. This deficit is absent when astronauts are exposed to centrifugal forces, suggesting that the adaptive CNS changes are taking place centrally rather than peripherally. During the first days in orbit, the asymmetry of vertical eye movements in response to moving visual scenes is inverted. A return to symmetry of the vestibulo-ocular and optokinetic reflexes is then observed. Some studies have shown increased latencies and decreased peak velocities of saccades, while others have found just the opposite. It is possible that these conflicting results depend on when the measures were obtained during the mission. There is also a serious disruption of smooth pursuit eye movements, especially in the vertical plane. Human missions to Mars will include several transitions between different gravitational environments. These changes will eventually affect the reflex eye movements. A key question is whether astronauts can have different sets of reflexes among which they can rapidly switch based on the gravitational environment. Determination of the dual- adaptive capabilities of reflex eye movements in such circumstances is vitally important so that it can be determined to what extent the Sensory-motor coupling skills acquired in one-g environment will transfer to others. Spatial orientation An astronaut on board the International Space Station is wearing a head-mounted display for performing a space neuroscience experiment aimed at evaluating changes in perceived depth and distance. In weightlessness, astronauts must rely much more on vision to maintain their spatial orientation, because the otolith organs can no longer signal the ‚Äúdown‚Äù direction. During prolonged exposure, however, reliance seems to shift toward an intrinsic, body vertical reference. The erroneous illusions of self- motion during head movements performed during and after return to Earth gravity are presumably due to a re-interpretation of vestibular inputs. Ground-based studies suggest that the CNS resolves the ‚Äútilt-translation‚Äù ambiguity based on the frequency content of the linear acceleration detected by the otolith organs, with low frequency indicating ‚Äútilt‚Äù and high frequency indicating ‚Äútranslation‚Äù. A crossover exists at about 0.3 Hz where the otolith signals are then ambiguous. Exposure to weightlessness presumably results in a shift of this crossover frequency, which could then contribute to spatial disorientation and SMS. Although investigations of higher cognitive processes, such as navigation and mental rotation are limited, the astronauts frequently report that the spacecraft interiors look longer and higher than they actually are, and a reduction in the perceived height of three-dimensional objects is observed in-flight compared with pre-flight, suggesting an alteration in the mental representation of three-dimensional cues in weightlessness. Perception is a model of the brain, a hypothesis about the world that presupposes the Newton's laws of motion. These laws change in weightlessness and, therefore, one could expect changes in the mental representation of objects‚Äô shape and distance during spaceflight. The rare investigations carried out in space so far have not demonstrated drastic changes, probably because the CNS continues to use an internal model of gravity, at least for a short while. It can be speculated that the way of processing three dimensions will be more developed after a long absence of a gravitational reference. Further investigations carried out in space will perhaps reveal that other higher cortical functions are impaired in weightless conditions. The combination of virtual reality with the measurement of evoked potentials and brain mapping on board the International Space Station should provide exciting results on the adaptive mechanisms of cerebral functions in weightlessness. Neuroscience and space exploration From Voskhod to the International Space Station, spacecraft have improved in size and comfort and have allowed more and more people traveling into orbit. However, even with all of the human spaceflight experience gained over the past fifty years, no single completely effective countermeasure, or combination of countermeasures, exists against the negative effects of long- duration exposure to weightlessness. If a crew of astronauts were to embark on a six-month journey to Mars today, the countermeasures currently employed would presumably leave them less operational after landing. Many believe that physiological adaptation to Mars gravity (0.38 G) and re-adaptation to Earth gravity (1 G) would be enhanced by frequent exposure to artificial gravity on board the spacecraft en route to and from Mars. This would require an on-board human-rated centrifuge or spacecraft rotation to produce a centrifugal force similar to gravity. This solution, while potentially effective, raises a number of operational, engineering, and physiological issues that will need to be addressed. The human physiological responses to long-duration exposure to anything other than zero-gravity or Earth's gravity are unknown. Research is needed to identify the minimum level, duration, and frequency of gravity level required to maintain normal CNS functions, as well as the importance of a gravity gradient across the body. The complex functioning of the CNS, even in the 1-G environment of Earth, has not revealed all its secrets. The most basic space neuroscience questions must be answered to minimize risks and optimize crew performance during transit and planetary operations. The results of this research will certainly find other applications in medicine and biotechnology. Our ability to understand how Earth's gravitational environment has shaped the evolution of sensory and motor systems can give us a clearer understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of CNS functions. Knowledge of the effects of gravity on CNS functions in humans, as well as elucidation of the basic mechanisms by which these effects occur, will be of direct benefit to understanding the impact of, and providing countermeasures for, long-term exposure of humans to the weightlessness of spaceflight and the partial gravity of Moon and Mars bases.

Biography Hermann Winkelmann was born in Braunschweig in 1849. His father, Christian Ludewig Theodor Winkelmann, was the founder of , piano manufacturers, and he himself planned to continue his father's trade. He went to Paris to study piano construction, but while there he decided to become a singer. He had his initial training in Paris, and later with Koch in Hanover. Winkelmann made his debut as Manrico in Verdi's Il trovatore in the Court Theatre of Sondershausen in 1875. He then sang in such places as Altenburg, Darmstadt, and Leipzig. He joined the Hamburg State Opera in 1878. The first role he created was that of Anton Rubinstein's N√©ron, in a German translation at the Theater am Dammtor in Hamburg on 1 October 1879 (it did not have its Russian premiere until 1884). Winkelmann became a Heldentenor specialising in the music dramas of Richard Wagner, and was known for the title roles of Tannh√§user and Lohengrin, and as Walther von Stolzing in Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg. Hermann Winkelmann in the inaugural production of Parsifal Most notably, Wagner himself chose Winkelmann to create the title role of Parsifal at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus in 1882, and he sang it there until 1891, usually alongside Amalie Materna, the creator of the role of Kundry. He was seen at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, during the Hamburg Opera's London visit in 1882, under Hans Richter. He created Tristan in London; in fact, he and Richter required so many rehearsals of Tristan und Isolde that this caused the postponement of the premiere of Hubert Parry's latest symphony. He was also the first Walther to be heard in London. He also sang Lohengrin and Tannh√§user there, and participated in a then-rare performance of Beethoven's Choral Symphony, also under Richter.The Straits Times, 2 March 1912, A Great Wagner Singer In 1883 Winkelmann became a member of the Vienna Court Opera, where he was celebrated mainly for his Wagner performances. He was the first Tristan in Vienna (1883), and also the first Otello in that city, where he remained until 1906.Gustav Mahler ‚Äì Vienna: The Years of Challenge (1897‚Äì1904) by Henry-Louis de La Grange In 1884 he appeared in the United States at Wagner festivals in New York, Chicago, Boston and Cincinnati, some under the baton of Theodore Thomas. He toured with Emil Scaria and Amalie Materna, with whom he had performed at the Vienna State Opera. He later sang in concert, oratorio and lieder. He retired from the stage in 1907, and died at Mauer, Vienna, in 1912, aged 62. Recordings exist of his voice in his later career, and he appears in The Record of Singing. His son Hans Winckelmann was also an opera singer.

The complex is located near the beach in Tel Aviv over Eliezer Peri Street and is connected to the promenade, to Sderot Ben-Gurion (Ben-Gurion Boulevard) and Hayarkon Street. West of the square is the Gordon Pool. History Atarim Square Before the construction of the square, the neighborhood consisted of shacks and shanties. It was established as a temporary residence to Jewish refugees, forced to flee from Jaffa during the Jaffa riots of 1921 and for new immigrants. The beach neighborhood was subject to frequent winter flooding and high winds. In the 1950s, evacuation of the neighborhood began. In the 1960s, the Tel Aviv municipality decided to develop the city's northern beaches, and to build modern hotels along the coast. It was decided to develop the square as a tourist center to connect the hotels, beaches and Sderot Ben-Gurion, and planned to include a main road parallel to the shore and parking lot. The center was planned by architect Yaakov Rechter. Construction began in 1971. The multi-purpose structure was built on a number of levels which exploited the difference in elevations between the cliff where the beach was. The lower level includes a parking lot and gas station. The level above includes a covered highway (Eliezer Peri Street). Two levels above sea level consists of indoor shops and the top level (roof structure) forms a square, including a number of restaurants, an amphitheater and a rotunda coated with glass (formerly known as Colosseum Club ). In the northern part of the square lies another building which includes the Marina Hotel and several floors of shops. The square was inaugurated in June 1975. In the early years the square was lively, with two levels of shops and restaurants. The northern structure established duty-free stores for tourists. In the late 1970s, criminal elements took over the shops, and the square began to be neglected. In 1982, the Colosseum nightclub, the largest club in Israel opened there, and operated until the late 1990s. However, the square continued to decline. During the Gulf War in 1991, Mayor Shlomo Lahat quipped that he hoped a Scud missile would destroy it. Although the square had originally been named Namir Square, named after Mordechai Namir, Namir's widow, Ora Namir, requested that her late husband's name be withdrawn from the square and for him to be honored some other way after the square's decline.

It lies about three-quarters of a mile north-east of the village of Marske. Description Applegarth now encompasses West Applegarth, High Applegarth, East Applegarth, Low Applegarth and Applegarth Low Wood, and includes the limestone crag of Applegarth Scar. Applegarth bridleway runs along the valley through the settlement, and is still a bridleway despite an attempt to have it downgraded in 2010. History The name Applegarth has Norse origins. A mansion stood on the site now occupied by West Applegarth farm, and the land to the north of Applegarth Scar was wild forest, with wolves and fallow deer. Applegarth was part of the manor of Ravensworth which belonged for many years to the FitzHughs. Applegarth Forest was described as picturesque and delightful in 1791. In 1250, free warren in Applegarth was granted to Henry, son of Ralph de Ravenswath, and at the time of Kirkby's Inquest of 1284, Robert de Applegarth, a bailiff of Richmond, held a carucate of land at Applegarth under Hugh Fitz Henry. The FitzHughs continued to own Applegarth until the sixteenth century, when it passed to William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton. Parr granted Applegarth to a faithful retainer, Thomas son of Geoffrey Middleton, who lived there with his wife and large family. Thomas died in 1565, and the inventory of his effects includes eleven horses, fifteen cows, silver plate, his best suit of yellow satin and two other suits, his coat of steel and a crimson velvet coat of cloth of gold. When Parr died without heir in 1571, the manor of Ravenswath, including Applegarth, passed to the crown, and King Charles I granted the estate to the citizens of London in 1629, who sold it to two brothers, Jerome and John Robinson of St. Trinians, near Richmond. John resided in Applegarth for some time and died in 1656. His granddaughters sold Applegarth in 1675 to Sir Thomas Wharton, from whom it passed to Elizabeth Byerley in 1764, then to her five cousins. It was subsequently sold to James Hutchinson MD in 1788, then to John Hutton in 1814.

At Purdue, he established a solar energy research program in which two experimental solar houses (one with large double glazed windows) were built on the Purdue campus in the summer of 1945. By analyzing this experiment, Hutchinson concluded that the solar gain through the double glazed house was greater than the excess heat loss.

An ex-Confederate soldier in his youth, he later enlisted in the U.S. Army and served with the 5th U.S. Cavalry during the Indian Wars against the Plains Indians from 1869 to 1873. He acted as a guide for Lieutenant Colonel George Crook in his \\"winter campaign\\" against the Apaches and received the Medal of Honor for his conduct. From 1874 to 1877, Beauford served under indian agent John Clum as chief of scouts and captain of the San Carlos Apache Police. He and Clum are credited for the capture of Geronimo at Ojo Caliente in 1877 and he is largely responsible for turning the San Carlos police into one of the most respected law enforcement agencies in the Southwestern United States during the frontier era. He became a successful rancher and prospector in the years following his retirement. A popular pioneering figure during his lifetime, Beauford was briefly elected to Arizona's territorial legislature in 1885 to represent Graham County.

At age 14, upon the start of the American Civil War, he ran away from home to join the Confederate Army. He enlisted under an alias, Clay Beauford, partly because of his age and to avoid being brought back home by his father. Beauford initially spent the first year of the war as a drummer boy with General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, however, he became a regular infantryman within a year.Barnes, Will Croft. Arizona Place Names. Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 1960. (pg. 177) In 1863, he saw action at Battle of Gettysburg and was among the 4,500 men who took part in Pickett's Charge.

(pg. 673) Beauford remained with the 5th Cavalry throughout his military career and had risen to the rank of first sergeant by the time he was posted to the Arizona Territory three years later. He was praised by Captain Robert H. Montgomery on September 26, 1872, following a battle against the Apache in the Red Rock area. He also served under Lieutenant Colonel George Crook during his \\"winter campaign\\" against renegade Apaches, particularly the Western Apache and Yavapai bands in the Tonto Basin, and helped guide Crook's columns during the expedition.

(pg. 148) Beauford did not receive the award until April 12, 1875, two years after being discharged from service. Beauford later claimed that his last year in the military was physically the hardest of his life being on almost constant patrol in the Arizona frontier. One of his later exploits was the capture of White Mountain Apache chieftain Toga-da-chuz and his family, including his son the future The Apache Kid, which he brought back to the San Carlos reservation.Miller, Joseph, ed. The Arizona Story. New York: Hastings House, 1952. He continued working as a civilian scout for the army until the spring of 1875. San Carlos Police Chief When Indian agent John Philip Clum was appointed head of the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation in 1874, Beauford accepted Clum's offer to become chief of the San Carlos Apache Police. Tasked with keeping the peace among the more than 4,000 Native Americans then living on the reservation, many of whom did not get along with each other, Beauford was considered ideal for the position given his years of experience as a guide and scout,Head, Tom and David Wolcott.

New York: Harrow and Heston, 1998. worked well with Clum to establish the San Carlos police force as an independent agency from the U.S. Army. It initially consisted four Apache scouts, however, this was later expanded to a permanent 25-man police force by the time he took command.French, Laurence, ed. Indians and Criminal Justice. Totowa, New Jersey: Allanheld, Osmun & Co., 1982. (pg. 111) These first recruits were hand-picked from the various tribes and bands on the reservation and armed with needle-guns and fixed ammunition. Beauford provided them with modest uniforms and taught them military drill formations. The small police force quickly became an excellent drill team and became very popular among the younger men on the reservation. Many were eager to join up and within a few months the reservation police had attracted hundreds of new officers. His efforts would eventually transform the San Carlos police department into one of the prominent law enforcement agencies in the American Southwest. In December 1875, Beauford was the subject of a failed assassination attempt by Tonto Apache chief Disalin. Failing to kill John Clum and an agency clerk at the main building, Disalin made a last desperate bid to gun down the police chief. He found Beauford shortly after fleeing Clum's office. His first shot missed and, while moving closer to take a second shot, Disalin was shot and killed by an Indian police officer.Worcester, Donald E. The Apaches: Eagles of the Southwest.

(pg. 229) They brought 21 women and children back to San Carlos. Clum commended the actions of the officers and personally praised Beauford's abilities to Department of the Interior. He had a limited role in the concentration of Apaches from the Chiracahua and Fort Apache reservations at San Carlos. On April 21, 1877, he headed the 102-man Apache police force, accompanied by John Clum, which captured Geronimo at Ojo CalienteHaley, James L. Apaches: A History and Culture Portrait. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1997. (pg. 313-315) and oversaw the subsequent transfer of the Warm Springs (or Mimbres) band to San Carlos, both occurring without violence from either side. He officially retired on September 1, 1877, two weeks after Clum's resignation, although he may have had occasional contact with the force up until at least 1880. Later years Beauford became a cattle rancher after leaving the San Carlos reservation, establishing a homestead in Aravaipa Canyon he called \\"Spring Gardens\\".\\"University of Arizona Bulletin\\" Tucson, Arizona: University of Arizona Press, 1933. (pg. 66) He also did some prospecting developing the \\"Arizona Mine\\" in the Aravaipa Mining District which he later sold at a good profit. In or around 1879, Beauford made the acquaintance of a young woman from Indianapolis, Indiana, Cedonia Alexander, who was visiting relatives in Fort Thomas. Their friendship eventually developed into a courtship and were married the following September. Prior to his engagement, he had his name legally changed back to his birth name, Welford Chapman Bridwell, by the 10th Territorial Legislative Assembly. A very popular and well-known figure in Arizona during his lifetime, it was said that \\"probably no other Arizona pioneer was more widely known or had a larger circle of friends\\". Author and historian Dan L. Thrapp described Beauford in his Encyclopedia of Frontier Biography as being \\"tall, slender, broad-shouldered, companionable, could sing a ballad to his own banjo accompaniment, and fairly well controlled 'a quick and violent temper'.\\" Mount Buford, located 4 miles north of Kentuck Mountain in Maricopa County, is named in his honor. He had a brief political career being elected to the council (or \\"upper house\\") of Arizona's territorial legislature as a delegate for Safford, Graham County in the 13th Assembly in 1885. It was during the session that Beauford was involved in a physical altercation in a Prescott saloon. While drinking in the saloon, he was approached by a French-born lobbyist for the Arizona Copper Company in Clifton, Professor Arnold, who \\"cast aspersions\\" on Beauford for renouncing his presumed French heritage by changing his name. Their argument escalated with Beauford finally striking Arnold to which the Frenchman challenged to a duel. Beauford agreed but the two were unable to agree on the weapons, Beauford choosing Colt revolvers while Arnold preferred French sabers, and with swords not readily available in Arizona the duel was eventually called off. In 1895, Beauford moved his family to Los Angeles, California where they raised their young children. His only son Walter died at an early age, however, his daughter Nina became the wife of eminent physician Dr. Arthur F. Maisch in 1903. Beauford died in Los Angeles on February 1, 1905, at age 58, and interred in Angelus-Rosedale Memorial Park.

Ride experience At the start of the cycle, a movable floor drops to allow clearance for the ride to move. After that, the ride begins to swing back and forth as the circular gondola rotates, gaining more height and speed with each swing. At the peak, riders reach a height of above the ground although the structure of the ride is only tall. The pendulum motion propels riders back and forth at up to an arc of 120 degrees, making it the fastest non-coaster ride at Cedar Point. At the end of the cycle, the pendulum gradually slows to a stop and the gondola stops rotating. Once the pendulum and gondola are parked at the loading position, the floor rises and the restraints release. Before the 2019 season, maXair operated a somewhat longer cycle and the gondola rotated counterclockwise. As of 2019, the gondola now rotates clockwise. maXair is one of several rides at Cedar Point that require glasses to be secured with an athletic strap. Loose articles may be brought into the queue, but must be secured in small cubbies located around the gondola on the loading platform. Riders are secured with a ratcheting shoulder harness and a backup seatbelt between the legs.

The presence of two distinct pharmacophores confers on biphalin a high affinity for both Œº and Œ¥ opioid receptors (with an EC50 of about 1-5 nM for both Œº and Œ¥ receptors), therefore it has analgesic activity. Biphalin presents a considerable antinociceptive profile. In fact, when administered intracerebroventricularly in mice, biphalin displays a potency almost 7-fold greater than that of the ultra-potent alkaloid agonist, etorphine and 7000-fold greater than morphine; biphalin and morphine were found to be equipotent after intraperitoneal administration. The extraordinary in vivo potency shown by this compound is coupled with low side-effects, in particular, to produce no dependency in chronic use. For these reasons, several efforts have been carried out in order to obtain more information about structure-activity relationship (SAR). Results clearly indicate that, at least for Œº receptor binding, the presence of two pharmacophores is not necessary; Tyr1 is indispensable for analgesic activity, while replacing Phe at the position 4 and 4' with non-aromatic, but lipophilic amino acids does not greatly change the binding properties and in general 4,4' positions are found to be important to design biphalin analogues with increased potency and modified Œº/Œ¥ selectivity.

With the help of his son Lucius T. Sheffield, he was also the first to sell the paste in collapsible tubes. He also made important contributions to the fields of dentistry and dental surgery. He was considered one of the most skilled dentists in New England and the United States. In 1896, Colgate & Company began selling its own toothpaste that mimicked Sheffield's ready-made toothpaste and sold it in collapsible tubes like Sheffield. Later in life, he spent most of his time as treasurer and manager of his companies, the Sheffield Dentifrice Company (which later became Sheffield Pharmaceuticals) and the International Tooth Crown Company, in New London, Connecticut.  Early life  Sheffield was born April 23, 1827 in North Stonington, Connecticut, the third of eight children of the Reverend John Sheffield and Eliza (n√©e Lewis) Sheffield who married Feb. 6, 1820. Sheffield grew up in North Stonington, Connecticut, and was educated in its public schools.  Career  Figure 2. W.W. Sheffield's Diploma, Ohio College of Dental Surgery, 1865 As was the custom in the 18th and early 19th century, Sheffield began his career in 1850 training as an apprentice dentist with J. A. G. Comstock of New London, Connecticut. He furthered his dentistry education in New York City by working under Charles Allen and D. H. Porter. In April 1852, Sheffield moved to New London, Connecticut and began a long and successful practice in dentistry and dental surgery. Dr. Sheffield became one of the most successful dentists and dental surgeons in the United States. Sheffield graduated, in 1865, from the Ohio College of Dental Surgery, the second oldest dental school in the United States,A History of Dental and Oral Science in America, edited by James E. Dexter, 1876, p.179-181 as a Doctor of Dental Surgery, see Figure 2. In 1866, Dr. Sheffield received a naval commission from the President of the United States, Andrew Johnson, as a dental surgeon.  Family  Figure 3 - Lucius T. Sheffield Figure 3 - Lucius T. Sheffield's Harvard Diploma Sheffield married Miss Harriet P. Browne, daughter of Richard and Julia Browne of Providence, Rhode Island. This marriage produced one child, a son, Lucius T. Sheffield (May 28, 1854 ‚Äì September 20, 1901). Lucius Sheffield grew up in New London, Connecticut, and attended Norwich Free Academy. Lucius followed his father into dentistry and dental surgery. Lucius attended Harvard Medical School and graduated from Harvard's American Academy of Dental Medicine in 1878, see Figure 3. After graduation, from 1878 to 1879, Lucius traveled to Paris, France, to study and work in dentistry and dental surgery. Lucius was in Paris watching artists prepare their paint palettes when he realized the collapsible tubes they used to squeeze paint onto palettes could be used to squeeze his father's toothpaste onto a toothbrush in a sanitary manner.  Inventions  Human beings recognized long ago the relationship between clean teeth and tooth decay and dental disease. The desire for clean teeth led individuals and later doctors and dentists to create teeth cleaning agents and tools. Tooth picks, toothbrushes and tooth powders were early inventions designed to satisfy the need to clean teeth. Cleaning agents for the teeth were often sold by doctors and early druggists. Figure 4 shows an early example ad for Rogers's Tooth Powder advertised in the Norwich Packet, May 6, 1800. File:Figure-4---Roger's-Tooth-Powder.pngFigure 4 - Roger's Tooth Powder File:Figure-5---Sheffield's-Tooth-Powder.pngFigure 5 - Sheffield's Tooth Powder Tooth powder was popular up to World War II. Sheffield joined many doctors and dentists in formulating his own tooth powder for use on his patients and later as another product for his dentifrice company, see Figure 5. Early in Sheffield's dental practice, he formulated a mouthwash which he used for years on his patients. When he and his son started the Sheffield Dentifrice Co. in 1880, they improved and reformulated that mouthwash and sold it as ‚ÄúSheffield‚Äôs Elixir Balm‚Äù for the gums. Figure 6 shows early Sheffield products. File:Figure-6--Early-Sheffield-Products-Ad.pngFigure 6- A: Early Products of Sheffield Dentifrice Co. File:Figure-6-Jar-Top---Creme- Dentifrics.pngFigure 6- B: Illustration on top of cr√®me dentifrice jar Based on contemporary news reports at the time, Sheffield conceived of a ready-made tooth cr√®me in the mid-1870s and was using it on his patients with great praise from them. To this cr√®me, he added various extracts of mints that left a very pleasing taste in the mouth of his patients which caused them to request samples of the toothpaste. Sheffield shared his toothpaste formula with his son who was a dentistry student at Harvard during this period. The oldest surviving toothpaste record within the Sheffield Pharmaceuticals‚Äô archives, the successor to the Sheffield Dentifrice Co., is a notebook formula of the son, L.T. Sheffield, from 1878. L.T. Sheffield's notebook formula for toothpaste is seen in Figure 7. File:Figure-7-1-LT-Sheffield- Notebook.pngFigure 7A ‚Äì L.T.

Sheffield's 1878 notebook with toothpaste formula page 3 In response to toothpaste demands from patients, Sheffield started a manufacturing company, in early 1880. Initially, Sheffield was making toothpaste batches at his dental office at the corner of State Street and Green Street in New London, Connecticut. Demand grew rapidly and he was forced to build a laboratory and manufacturing facility behind his residence.

Sheffield and his son called this product ‚ÄúDr. Sheffield‚Äôs Cr√®me Angelique Dentifrice‚Äù. This product was the first toothpaste and it was sold in collapsible tubes. An illustration of that first toothpaste is seen in Figure 8. Sheffield's son, now a Doctor of Dentistry, registered the trademark of that first toothpaste in 1881, see Figure 9. The first advertisement ever published for toothpaste appeared on March 12, 1881 in the New London Telegram, see Figure 10. Figure 10 First Toothpaste Ad The largest druggist in New London, at the time, was Nichols & Harris.

Figure 13 ‚Äì Sheffield's Lab, circa 1893 On March 7, 1882, a newspaper reporter for the largest newspaper in New London visited Sheffield at his laboratory on Broad Street in New London, Connecticut. The report of that visit was published on March 8, 1882, in The New London Evening Telegram newspaper, see Figure 14. The reporter describes the innovations L.T. Sheffield employed to get the ‚ÄúCr√®me Angelique‚Äù toothpaste into collapsible tubes. Figure 14 - New London Evening Telegram, March 8, 1882, describes toothpaste being packaged in tubes In 1883, Sheffield revised the original ‚ÄúCr√®me Angelique‚Äù toothpaste formula. He called the revised formula ‚ÄúDr. Sheffield‚Äôs Cr√®me Dentifrice‚Äù toothpaste. This revised formula remained in production years after Dr. Sheffield's death in 1897. After 1900, the Sheffield Dentifrice Co. became a contract toothpaste manufacturer for many individuals and companies and has remained so to the present day. From 1880 to 1892, the Sheffield Dentifrice Co. purchased collapsible tubes to package the toothpaste. Beginning in 1892, the company started manufacturing its own collapsible tubes by purchasing tube manufacturing presses and fabricating its own tube-making machinery. In 1900 the dentifrice company started a new company called the New England Collapsible Tube Co. This was the fourth collapsible tube manufacturer in the United States. During his career, Sheffield worked at the cutting edge of dental prosthetics. He specialized in dental bridges and tooth crowns. On May 26, 1885, Sheffield was granted patent No. 318,581 for a dental bridge to hold multiple crowns together on broken or decayed teeth. During that same period, Sheffield's son, L.T. Sheffield, DDM, received eight patents for various types of artificial dentures. In 1886, Sheffield and his son formed the International Tooth Crown Company. Lucius T. Sheffield, DDM was president and W.W. Sheffield was treasurer. This company purchased the crown patents of two prominent dentists, James E. Low and Cassius M. Richmond. All these crown and bridge patents were combined under one company which the two doctors advertised as Sheffield's Perfect Crowning System, see Figure 15. Sheffield and his son received royalties from dentists around the world when they employed crowns and bridges covered under the Sheffields' patents.

They have traditionally been classified by the way in which the system interacts with fresh air from the surrounding atmosphere, and by whether the patient rebreathes gases that they have previously exhaled. However, there is no international standard for classifying breathing systems, and the terms \\"semi- open\\" and \\"semi-closed\\" may cause confusion in particular between US and British usage. Strictly speaking, the term \\"circuit\\" is only accurate in the case of closed systems where the breathed gas completes a full circuit. *Open systems use unrestricted ambient air as the source of fresh gas, with no boundary between the patient's airway and the atmosphere. Purely open systems - for instance, gauze soaked in ether by the open-drop technique and held near the patient's face - are archaic and are no longer in clinical use. They have no reservoir and no rebreathing takes place. *Semi-open systems such as the Schimmelbusch mask use ambient air as the fresh gas source, but incorporate some sort of apparatus or reservoir that restricts the supply by creating a partial boundary with the atmosphere. No rebreathing occurs. *Semi-closed systems have a full boundary with the surrounding atmosphere, and use a controlled source for fresh gas flow. Intake of ambient air is prevented, but excess fresh gas is vented into the surrounding atmosphere. Partial rebreathing of exhaled gas can occur. They are commonly subdivided using the Mapelson classification (see below). *Closed systems have a totally closed boundary across which no gas enters or is vented, meaning that complete rebreathing takes place. The commonest example is the circle system. Mapelson classification The British physicist and physiologist William Mapelson developed a classification in 1954 which divided semi-closed breathing systems into five groups named A to E, with a sixth group F subsequently being added. They include a reservoir that can hold fresh gas, exhaled gas, or a mix of both depending on the system and the mode of ventilation. They vary in their efficiency, in that some need wastefully higher fresh gas flows in certain situations to ensure that carbon dioxide is removed safely, avoiding rebreathing that can lead to hypercapnia. Those classified as Mapelson A are the most efficient for unassisted continuous spontaneous ventilation, while D, E and F systems are more efficient for assisted ventilation. *Mapelson A systems, also known as Magill systems, are efficient for spontaneous ventilation, but inefficient for controlled ventilation as high gas flows will be needed to avoid the patient rebreathing the air that has just left the lungs. A Lack system is a coaxial modification of the Mapelson A system. *Mapelson B and Mapelson C systems are essentially the same, with the B circuit having longer tubing than the C circuit. They are inefficient for both spontaneous and controlled ventilation, as they require high gas flows to prevent rebreathing. The B circuit is not in clinical use, but the C circuit is commonly used during patient transfer and in resuscitation as it is compact. The Waters bag, developed by Ralph Waters, comprises a C system with an attached soda lime absorption canister to remove exhaled carbon dioxide, meaning that exhaled gases can safely be rebreathed. *Mapelson D systems are inefficient for spontaneous ventilation due to needing high gas flows to prevent rebreathing, but are efficient for controlled ventilation. A Bain system is a coaxial modification of the Mapelson D system. *Mapelson E systems, also known as Ayre's T-piece, are used in anaesthesia for children. The reservoir consists of a length of tubing; if this is short, then the system functions more like an open system. They have no valves or reservoir bag, meaning they have low resistance to spontaneous breathing. They are inefficient as they require high gas flows. *Mapelson F systems are also used for children, and consist of an adapted Mapelson E system to which a reservoir bag has been added to the tubing - this is called the \\"Jackson-Rees modification\\", after Gordon Jackson Rees. This allows both spontaneous and controlled ventilation, as well as the application of continuous positive airway pressure. The Humphrey ADE is a multifunctional breathing system which can be converted into a type A, D or E system depending on the requirements by flipping a lever to change the order of the fresh gas, reservoir and valves. It therefore can be optimised to allow efficient spontaneous or controlled ventilation in both children and adults. Circle systems Circle systems are totally closed breathing systems that incorporate a carbon dioxide scrubber and a series of one-way valves, meaning that gases expired by the patient can be reused without risk of carbon dioxide toxicity. This means that they use fresh gas and inhalational anaesthetic agents very efficiently, and they cause little pollution as waste gas is not expelled to the environment. However, they require a high initial gas flow in order to prime the full length of the system with the desired concentration of gases. The first circle system was introduced by Bryan Sword in 1950.

Background For the most part, the \\"Whites\\" had colour covers with interiors printed in black ink on white paper, although there was a handful of comics with colour interiors. They proliferated in Canada after the War Exchange Conservation Act restricted the importation of non-essential goods from the United States into Canada, including fiction periodicals. Four companies took advantage of the situation by publishing comics in Canada, sometimes using imported scripts. Anglo-American Publishing of Toronto and Maple Leaf Publishing in Vancouver started publishing in March 1941. Later, two other Toronto-based publishers joined in: Hillborough Studios that August, and Bell Features (originally Commercial Signs of Canada) in September. Some of the more notable \\"Whites\\" creators included Ed Furness, Ted McCall, Adrian Dingle, Gerald Lazare, Jon St. Ables, Fred Kelly, and Leo Bachle, all of whom would later be inducted into the Joe Shuster Award's Canadian Comic Book Creator Hall of Fame. This period has been called the Golden Age of Canadian comics, but the age of the \\"Whites\\" did not last long.

Her work was known for its interpretation of natural themes in almost abstract forms. She exhibited in shows and galleries throughout the U.S. Her paintings are included in many public collections. Life Dehn was born in Nevada, Missouri on October 26, 1922. Raised in Hamden, Connecticut, she studied at Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri before moving to New York City. She met the artist Adolf Dehn while working at the Art Students League. They married in November 1947. The two artists worked side by side for many years, part of a group of artists who influenced the history of 20th century American Art. Their Chelsea brownstone was a place where artists, writers, and intellectuals often gathered  Early Career  Virginia Dehn studied art at Stephens College in Missouri before continuing her art education at the Traphagen School of Design, and, later, the Art Students League, both located in New York City. Conners, Ginny L. Unpublished paper. West Hartford, CT. In the mid-1940s while working at the Associated American Artists gallery, Virginia met lithographer and watercolorist Adolf Dehn. Adolf was older than her and he already enjoyed a successful career as an artist. Virginia and Adolf were married in 1947 in a private ceremony at Virginia's parents house in Wallingford, Connecticut. Virginia and Adolf Dehn The Dehns lived in a Chelsea brownstone on West 21st Street where they worked side by side. The Dehns often hosted gatherings of other influential artists and intellectuals of the 20th century. Among their closest friends were sculptor Federico Castellon and his wife Hilda, writer Sidney Alexander and his wife Frances, artists Sally and Milton Avery, Ferol and Bill Smith, also an artist, and Lily and Georges Schreiber, an artist and writer. Bob Steed and his wife Gittel, an anthropologist, were also good friends of the Dehns. According to friend Gretchen Marple Pracht, ‚ÄúVirginia was a glamorous and sophisticated hostess who welcomed visitors to their home and always invited a diverse crowd of guests‚Ä¶‚Äù Despite their active social life the two were disciplined artists working at their easels nearly daily and taking Saturdays to visit galleries and view new work. The Dehns made annual trips to France to work on lithographs at the Atelier Desjobert in Paris. Virginia used a bamboo pen to draw directly on the stone for her lithographs, which often depicted trees or still lifes. The Dehn's other travels included visits to Key West, Colorado, Mexico, and countries such as Greece, Haiti, Afghanistan, and India. Virginia Dehn's style of art differend greatly from that of her husband, though the two sometimes exhibited together. A friend of the couple remarked, ‚ÄúAdolf paints landscapes; Virginia paints inscapes.‚Äù Virginia Dehn generally painted an interior vision based on her feelings for a subject, rather than a literal rendition of it. Many of her paintings consist of several layers, with earlier layers showing through. Virginia found inspiration in the Abstract Expressionism movement that dominated the New York and Paris art scenes in the 1950s.Cox, Richard. Virginia Dehn Essay. Some of her favorite artists included Adolf Gottileb, Rothko, William Baziotes, Pomodoro, and Antonio Tapies. Virginia Dehn most often worked with bold, vibrant colors in large formats. Virginia's subjects were not literal, but intuitive. She learned new techniques of lithography from her husband Adolf Dehn and did her own prints. Texture was very important to Virginia in her work. Her art was influenced by a variety of sources. In the late 1960s Virginia came across a book that included photographs of organic patterns of life as revealed under a microscope, these images inspired her to change the direction of some of her paintings. Other influences of Virginia's art came from ancient and traditional arts of various cultures throughout the world, including Persian miniatures, illuminated manuscripts, Dutch still life painting, Asian art, ancient Egyptian artifacts, and work by Giotto, Monet, Vuillard, Munch, and Bonnard, mixed with the modernism of the New York art scene. Her husband Adolf was a constant inspiration until his death in 1968.  Later Career  In the 1970s Dehn began making large mixed media paintings with overlays of clay and acrylic Dehn moved from New York City to Santa Fe in 1985. She enjoyed the sense of space and calm there that couldn't be found in New York City. After moving to New Mexico, some of her paintings began to take on a sculptural quality, as she began working more with materials such as clay and metallic substances into her paintings. The metallic colors she used in some works showed her interest in the interaction of light and matter. The petroglyphs of the southwest interested her, and along with her study of ancient artifacts from Egypt and Asia. Some of her works began to feature what looked like hieroglyphics. During her artistic career, Virginia received fellowships from Yaddo, MacDowell Colony and Ossabaw Island Project. Her work was exhibited in shows and galleries throughout the country and paintings of hers are part of many public collections. A traveling show sponsored by the Albuquerque Museum of Art and History called ‚ÄúLayerists in Multi-media‚Äù included her paintings. She was given the Salamagundi Club prize for a still life painting in 1968 by the National Academy of Design. In her later years, Virginia Dehn continued to create as she retained a circle of devoted friends and admirers. Despite health struggles Dehn kept painting until her death at her home in Santa Fe, NM on July 26, 2005. Her work is currently represented by Thomas French Fine Art and The Bundy Modern.

Background  The first historical reference in traditional sources to Lei Yanwei was in 901, when his father Lei Man died, while serving as the military governor of Wuzhen. Upon Lei Man's death, Lei Yanwei claimed the title of acting military governor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 262.  As Jiedushi of Wuzhen  By 903, he was referred to as full military governor. In 903, Du Hong, the military governor of nearby Wuchang Circuit (Ê≠¶Êòå, headquartered in modern Wuhan, Hubei) came under the attack of Li Shenfu, a general under Yang Xingmi the military governor of Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu). Du sought aid from his ally Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan). Zhu sent his general Han Qing () to aid Du, but apparently judging that his army was not enough to save Du, also elicited aid from Lei Yanwei, as well as Cheng Rui the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (ËçäÂçó, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei) and Ma Yin the military governor of Wu'an Circuit (Ê≠¶ÂÆâ, headquartered in modern Changsha, Hunan). Cheng, who was allied with Zhu as well, launched a large fleet and headed for Wuchang, intending to save Du. However, after he departed from Jingnan's capital Jiangling Municipality, Lei sent his officer Ouyang Si () to rendezvous with Ma's officer Xu Dexun, and together, they sacked Jiangling, capturing its population and wealth. This destroyed the morale of Cheng's soldiers, and Cheng was subsequently defeated by Li and committed suicide by drowning.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 264. Lei apparently took over Jiangling for some time,New Book of Tang, vol. 186. and continuing the practice of his father Lei Man, often pillaged the nearby circuits, such that it was said that the region between Jiangling and Wuchang's capital E Prefecture () was depleted of people. However, soon thereafter, Lei Yanwei's younger brother Lei Yangong rose against him and, in alliance with Zhao Kuangning the military governor of Zhongyi Circuit (Âø†Áæ©, headquartered in modern Xiangyang, Hubei), expelled him from Jiangling. That was the last historical reference to Lei Yanwei, and it is not clear based on the traditional sources where he went or what occurred to him afterwards. (As Lei Yangong himself was set to have taken control of Jiangling, and then was expelled by Zhao's brother Zhao Kuangming later in 903, Lei Yangong's rebellion against Lei Yanwei must be in 903 as well.)

Enthused about drinking legally, Jeff over imbibes and passes out. Casey and Miller want to take Jeff home but forget where he lives. Thinking that Nicole knows Jeff's address, they sneak into what they believe is her sorority house, only to discover it is a Latina one. Upstairs, they encounter two blindfolded pledges undergoing an initiation ritual. Miller paddles the girls' buttocks and orders them to make out. Upon realizing they were tricked, the entire sorority is furious. Casey and Miller escape, first tossing Jeff from an upstairs balcony onto a covered pool. Bouncing off uninjured, a drunken Jeff wants to continue partying. The boys locate Nicole at a pep rally. She refers them to her boyfriend, Randy, the angry guy from the bar. When he refuses to look up the address in his phone, the guys steal it. Jeff no longer lives at that address but a party is in progress there. While searching for somebody who knows Jeff's address, Casey and Miller leave him alone with two stoners. For fun, they strip Jeff, write \\"Douche Bag\\" on his forehead and glue a teddy bear to his crotch. Jeff wanders into the street, causing a commotion. The police apprehend and transfer him to the campus health center. As Casey and Miller head to the clinic, the vengeful Latina sorority girls abduct them. The guys find themselves in a ritualistic setting, stripped and shackled to the floor. They are forced to endure what they tricked the two pledge girls into doing. Embarrassed, bruised, and sporting bright-red spanked buttocks, they are released and walk across campus wearing only tube socks over their genitals. Casey blames Miller's immaturity for their predicament, unleashing long-simmering mutual resentments that culminates in a brawl. At the health center, Casey and Miller discover Jeff is on a 24-hour hold due to a previous suicide attempt. They encounter Nicole. She is there with Randy, who was injured at the pep rally, though she has just broken up with him. Casey and Miller eventually deduce where Jeff lives and smuggle him out of the clinic. Jeff, groggy and barely sober, steals Randy's truck, fleeing in it with Miller and Casey. Randy and his buddies, and also the police, chase them until the vehicle careens down an embankment, losing the pursuers. The boys arrive at Jeff's apartment with barely enough time to prepare him for the interview. Randy arrives, threatening the boys, but Jeff's father shows up and turns the tables on Randy. Encouraged by Casey and Miller, Jeff confronts his father, saying he does not want to be a doctor. Dr. Chang berates him until Jeff orders him to leave, surprisingly earning him Randy's respect, who resents his own domineering father. Casey, meanwhile, realizes he has fallen for Nicole and goes after her. Three months later, Miller, a college dropout who was an intelligent but academically lazy student, applies to the university. Casey is dating Nicole. Jeff is pursuing music and has a girlfriend.

Filming Principal photography was scheduled to begin on September 22, 2011, at the University of Washington.Filming of movie '21 & Over' continues on UW campus Key scenes were filmed in Lewis Hall, the University of Washington Medical Center, University Way NE, locally known as, \\"The Ave.\\", the Greek fraternities and sororities on 17th Ave NE, the UW's Husky Stadium area, and the UW's Quad and Red Square. The music festival scene was filmed at The Gorge Amphitheatre, which is located in George, Washington. The film was released on March 1, 2013. Chinese version For the version of the film shown in China, the directors included additional scenes in the beginning and at the end of the film. The Chinese-American lead is changed to a Chinese student who briefly transfers to an American college. According to Jon Lucas, the Chinese version will be about \\"a boy who leaves China, gets corrupted by our wayward, Western partying ways and goes back to China a better person.\\"https://latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-21-and- over-release-date-china-theaters-reviews-miles- teller-20130213,0,6665574.story?track=rss For the raunchy '21 & Over,' a very different message in China Reception The film opened on 2,771 screens and grossed $8.7 million during its opening weekend. It took in a $45.5 million worldwide total. Critical reaction On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 26% based on 107 reviews, and an average rating of 4.08/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Though it strives to mimic The Hangover, 21 and Over is too predictable, too unabashedly profane, and too inconsistently funny to carry the torch.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 34 out of 100 based on 21 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale. Relativity Media has been criticized by civil rights advocates for shooting part of the comedy 21 & Over in the city of Linyi, Shandong province in China, and choosing to ignore the area's bleak human rights records, notably the treatment suffered by activist lawyer Chen Guangcheng, who was being held under house arrest in a nearby village.

It is found locally in the Alps on dry limestone slopes. It is very similar to the Styrian ringlet (E. stirius) and has sometimes been included in that species. Description It has a wingspan of 46‚Äì56 mm.Whalley, Paul (1993) The Mitchell Beazley Guide to Butterflies, Mitchell Beazley, London. The upperwings of both sexes are mostly brown with reddish bands near the edge (postdiscal bands). The bands vary in size and may be dusted with brown in the males.Chinery, Michael (1998) Butterflies of Britain and Europe, HarperCollins, London. Within the bands are a variable number of eyespots (ocelli); these are black with white centres. The forewing has a large eyespot near the tip, often with two white centres. The hindwing has three or four spots. The underside of the male's forewing is largely orange with brown dusting in the basal half and a brown border. Unlike in the Styrian ringlet, the brown border does not taper towards the rear of the wing and has a dark \\"tooth\\" projecting into the orangeTolman, Tom & Richard Lewington (2008) Collins Butterfly Guide, HarperCollins, London. The tooth is less conspicuous in the females. The underside of the hindwing is mostly brownish, darker in the basal half. The subspecies E. s. triglites of the Bergamo Alps and Monte Generoso is more strongly marked than the nominate subspecies E. s. styx. It has a larger postdiscal band and larger eyespots on the upper forewing while the underside of the hindwing sometimes lacks eyespots. The subspecies E. s. trentae of the Julian Alps is even more strongly marked. It has large eyespots with bright white centres. Distribution and habitat It occurs in the Alps at altitudes of 600‚Äì2,200 metres. It is found in northern Italy from near Monte Generoso to the Dolomites, in Ticino canton in south-east Switzerland, in the Allg√§u Alps in south-east Germany, in parts of Austria and in the Julian Alps in Slovenia. It inhabits steep limestone slopes with scattered trees and bushes. It favours warm, dry, rocky areas. Life cycle The barrel-shaped eggs are grey-brown with brown spots and prominent ribs. The caterpillars are grey-brown with lighter and darker stripes and can reach 20‚Äì25 mm in length. They feed on grasses, particularly Sesleria varia. They take up to two years to mature, hibernating during the first and penultimate instars. The butterfly pupates among stones and grass in a green and brown chrysalis. The adults fly from early July until early September. A single brood is produced each year.

Its main product was the eponymous mobile app for sharing photos through social networking. It allowed people to take photos in addition to viewing other photos also taken in the vicinity. The application grouped photos based on a user's friends so that he or she is more likely to see those that are more relevant. Following skepticism and rumors from Silicon Valley commentators, Color Labs stopped selling the app at the end of 2012.  Launch  The group started when co-founders Bill Nguyen and Peter Pham received $41 million in funding. Color was named as a tribute to Apple's color logo from the Apple II. Nguyen described the Apple II as having changed his life when he was seven years old. The domain name Color.com was bought in December 2010 for $350,000. In 2010‚Äì2011, Color closed $25 million in funding from Sequoia Capital, $9 million from Bain Capital, and $7 million in venture debt from Silicon Valley Bank. In September 2011, Douglas Leone revealed that Sequoia Capital only invested three days before the scheduled launch of Color. On March 24, 2011, Color launched its eponymous mobile app in iOS App Store. A week after the launch, Color Labs released an update with significant changes to the iOS App interface‚Äîallowing users to see photos from events \\"Nearby\\", a \\"Feed\\" of relevant photos, and a \\"History\\" of groups that users can participate in. Words underneath each icon explaining what they did were also added. In July 2011, it was reported that Google offered to buy Color for $200 million before their first launch, but Color Labs turned down the deal.  Controversy and demise When it launched, the application had around 1 million downloads. By September 2011, the service had a little under 100,000 active users. In June 2011, less than three months after the company officially launched, Pham left Color, followed quickly by Chief Product Officer DJ Patil.https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/11/color-labs-chief-product-officer-dj- patil-resigns/ In the weeks following Color's initial launch, controversy surrounded the startup's $41 million funding and mixed reviews on the product. The initial launch left users confused with the application's user interface and purpose. Its initial rating in the App Store was 2 out of 5 stars. In an interview with Robert Scoble in April 2011, Pham and Nguyen admitted that Color's launch was a wasted opportunity, sharing: \\"We threw out a network you don‚Äôt know how to get good at‚Ä¶We threw a mountain at people.\\" In October 2012, media reports indicated that Color's board of directors had voted to shut down the company. Other sources denied that the company was shutting down, but suggested that it was possibly preparing to be acquired by another company or for some other major transformative event. Reports included that the staff would be sold to Apple for $2 to $7 million. In November Color Labs announced that the app would be shut down at the end of 2012.

Maple Leaf Publishing started publishing comic books in March 1941 and went out of business in late 1946. In contrast to the larger Anglo- American, which published many comics drawn by Canadians but based on imported American scripts, Maple Leaf focused on home-grown scripts. Maple Leaf's first publication, Better Comics #1, is thus considered to be the first true Canadian comic book. Maple Leaf's comics were modeled on the American format, minus the colour interiors.

It is closely related to Populus wilsonii, Wilson's poplar. Description Populus lasiocarpa is known for its large leaves that may reach dimensions of 35 √ó 25 cm. The stalk reaches a length of 20 cm and the bottom sides of the leaves are very hairy. The buds have a length of 3 cm. Shoots are sturdy, angular and fluffy. The petals grow on 25 cm long catkins and produce round, woolly fruit. This species blooms from March to May with the fruits ripening from May to June. Wilson's poplar differs from it in that the former's leaves are not hairy underneath and are generally smaller with a flattened petiole and resinous buds. File:Populus lasiocarpa leaves 01 by Line1.JPGThe leaves of P. lasiocarpa File:Populus lasiocarpa chaton mal by Line1.jpgMale catkins Distribution The native distribution of Populus lasiocarpa comprises the temperate zones of China including the provinces of Guizhou, Hubei, Shaanxi, Sichuan and Yunnan.

Currently, it is one of the biggest international events held in the Baltic States, attracting attention from about around 2000 students from 70 countries, i.e., USA, Germany, UK, Brazil, Canada, Singapore, Sweden, China, Italy, and others. Over 16 years, thousands of students have applied and competed against each other, to win prizes and gain experience. Participants of the competition are tested in their analytic and decision making skills in an online business simulation provided by CESIM, but their ability to provide creative solutions for real life business problems is challenged in case studies prepared by consultancy companies. Teams and individuals which break to the finals in Riga not only compete for main prizes, but also have an opportunity to listen to world famous speakers and attend social and networking events.  History  Peak Time has originated in year 1999, where it was first organized at the Stockholm School of Economics in Riga, exclusively by the students themselves. The initial aim of the competition was ‚Äúto find the most talented and passionate students from the Baltic States, involve top companies that were looking for high-performing employees and establish an annual meeting platform ‚Äì Peak Time‚Äù. As time passed by, it started to become more and more international, and now it gathers around 1.5 thousand participants from around 70 countries around the world. The motto of Peak Time is BE THE ONE WHO SHAPES TOMORROW OF BUSINESS.  Stages of the competition  Structure of Peak Time competition * Online registration Participants register as a team of four people or as an individual, when the registration for the competition is opened. After the participants have registered and sent in their applications, the preliminary online round of the competition starts. * Preliminary CESIM simulation rounds The first stage is playing in a business simulation, provided by the Finnish company CESIM. In the business simulation participants have to operate a production company in a competitive market and play against other teams in the assigned group. The goal of the simulation is to gain the biggest share of the market. After the simulation round, the results are summed up, and top 100 teams and top 100 individuals are invited to the next round of the competition. * Case studies and Team portfolios The next round of the competition is solving a case study. Case study is usually a challenging task - teams and individuals are provided with raw data and other relevant information about a company, market, country etc. and they have to provide both numerical and creative analysis for the given tasks. For example: how to cut on costs, without making the customer suffer from that. After the case study solutions are evaluated, 16 teams (64 people) and 16 individuals (16 people) are invited to come to the final stage which is held in Riga. If a person is invited as an individual, he or she is randomly given a team (to form 4 teams of 4 individual participants in each team) whereas those who come as teams continue to participate together. * Final event The finals in Riga have three stages: the first day is CESIM simulations, where the participants once again have to play a more complex yet faster version of the CESIM simulation. The next day they are given a case study, which they once again have to solve and present this time live to jury members. After the two stages are finished, the results are summed up and the top 5 teams are selected, who will have to prove their worthiness once more - they will receive another case study which they will then have to solve and present during only a couple of hours. Afterwards, the teams are ranked once again by the same jury members, and the winners of Peak Time are finally chosen.  Final event  The final event is not only about a tough competition. It's also a good time to meet new friends and acquaintances. Throughout the three days, the participants have special evening programmes: team building activities in the city, led by our student compadres, Cultural and National evenings, where the participants share something that they brought from their countries, or experience what Latvian culture has to offer. And of course a party. It is held on the day the top 5 is selected - during the party the winners are announced and leave to prepare for the next day, whereas the other finalists party SSE Riga style.

The occupation began on 15 October 2011 outside the Reserve Bank of Australia in Martin Place. The Martin Place occupation was first evicted by NSW Police on 23 October 2011. This eviction and later police action was named Operation Goulding. Another eviction attempt occurred on 2 February 2012. The protest site was removed five times in early July 2013, only to re-establish itself each time within hours. Overview Some of the major themes common to the protests included economic inequality, the alleged assault upon civil liberties at the hands of government and law enforcement, social injustice, corruption in the financial sector, corporate greed, and the influence of companies and lobbyists on government. Other issues that past and current participants have expressed include concerns with free assembly in public spaces, housing affordability and homelessness in Sydney, the treatment of Australia's indigenous people, and policies regarding the acceptance of asylum-seekers and refugees. Some within the Occupy movement (Sydney and abroad) have also espoused conspiratorial viewpoints. Rallies The largest rally took place on 5 November 2011 through Sydney's central business district (CBD). During the Form 1 process some protesters had agreed to cease the rally by 4:30 pm, however this decision did not represent the views of many of the other participants. Due to a number of reasons, including the large numbers of police assembled at Martin Place, the crowd made the decision to move to Hyde Park, where they remained until they were evicted by police. The movement then re-established itself at Martin Place, where it has remained for the last two years. Elections Glenn Wall of Occupy Sydney ran as an independent candidate at the 2012 Sydney by-election. He finished fourth out of five candidates, receiving 2.2 percent of the vote. The seat was won by independent candidate Alex Greenwich. Evictions and Occupy Sydney responses N.S.W. Police-initiated eviction attempts and arrests Occupy Sydney protestor, October 2011 On the morning of Sunday 23 October 2011, more than 100 police led by Assistant Commissioner Mark Murdoch forcibly removed about 80 protesters, with some protesters claiming that excessive force was used. The police and the New South Wales government defended the level of force, while Clover Moore, the Lord Mayor of Sydney, expressed concern about the violence, saying: \\"The city respects the right of people to protest\\". This eviction and later police action was named Operation Goulding.\\"Question by Mr Shoebridge to the Minister for Police and Emergency Services, Minister for the Hunter, and Vice-President of the Executive Council of New South Wales. 2334‚ÄîOPERATION GOULDING. parliament.nsw.gov.au/ The Occupy Sydney response to this eviction was supported by Councillor Irene Doutney's motion put to the City of Sydney Council, to allocate Occupy Sydney a permanent protest space. The Occupy Sydney General Assembly agreed to not attempt a full re-occupation pending the 7 November 2011 Council meeting, where this motion would be heard. An Occupy General Assembly was called to immediately follow the Council meeting. During the interim, some Occupiers maintained a daily physical presence. Police also guarded the Occupation site 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Following the adverse 7 November 2011 Council decision, a small group of Occupiers autonomously re-established the Occupation amidst a heavy police presence. Upon news of a re-occupation occurring, resources flowed back into Occupy Sydney. The General Assembly later endorsed this Occupation. In another eviction attempt on 2 February 2012, seven people were arrested and a significant amount of property was seized.\\"Occupy Sydney is finally over after police move in to Martin Place,\\" The Daily Telegraph, 2012. Retrieved 29 February 2012. Despite media reports at the time that declared the end of the occupation, protesters maintained a continuous presence at the site. On February 15, 2012, seven Occupy activists were arrested following a protest held outside the Greek consulate in Sydney City, over austerity measures. Of the seven, five were released without charge and two were charged with public mischief. Both of these individuals later escaped conviction. Sydney City Council-initiated eviction attempts The first council-initiated eviction attempt on the Occupy Sydney protest in Martin Place was at 7.30 p.m. on 3 July 2013. Occupiers returned on the same evening by 8.30 p.m. The site was also removed on 5 July 2013 (twice) at 9.30 a.m. and 4.00 p.m.; 7 July 2013 at 6.00 p.m.; and 9 July 2013 at 8.30 a.m. On 3 February 2014 an Occupy Sydney participant won a stay of proceedings http://www.jdbarrister.com.au/images/menu/Priestley%20Court%20of%20Appeal.pdf against the NSW Director of Public Prosecutions who on the instructions of NSW Premier Barry O'Farrell had appealed an earlier dismissal of a charge of camping and staying overnight.

Early life  According to author Will Bagley, McCarthy's grandfather immigrated to the United States from Ireland circa 1847 in the midst of the Great Famine. McCarthy's father Charles, born in Ohio in 1850, traveled to Utah, where he became a stage coach driver. He converted to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when he married Mary Mercer in 1876. Mary Wilson failed to conceive, so Charles took her sister as a second wife, later going to prison as a polygamist. Ironically, Mary Wilson then gave birth to two sons in quick succession, the second being Warren Wilson McCarthy. McCarthy was born in American Fork, Utah on July 24, 1884. The family immigrated to Alberta, Canada, where McCarthy grew up as a ranch hand and cowboy. Boots and western wear became the \\"standard attire for the rest of his life.\\" Denver novelist Sandra Dallas notes McCarthy was a colorful character in more ways than just his attire. \\"He accused his predecessor of having 'cracked ice pumping through your veins.' And he apparently was not as strait-laced as his Latter-day Saint upbringing might suggest, because he once invited his son to meet his mistress.\\" Wilson served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to his family's ancestral land of Ireland. Upon returning to the United States, however, he gave up on his cowboy lifestyle, marrying Minerva Woolley in 1910, moving to New York City and entering law school at Columbia University.  Career  After obtaining his law degree, Wilson returned to Utah, where he entered politics in the Democratic Party, worked as a district attorney, and was ultimately appointed to a judgeship on Utah's Third District Court in 1919. He left the bench in barely a year, going on to earn a sizable fortune in private practice. In 1926 he was elected to the state senate. In the wake of the Wall Street Crash of 1929, he was appointed by Republican President Herbert Hoover to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in 1932, even though McCarthy was a Democrat. Again, he served scarcely a year, this time leaving politics for a career in banking in San Francisco, California. In 1934, RFC Chairman Jess H. Jones asked McCarthy to take control of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad, which had just defaulted on a $10 million loan. The Rio Grande was back in court the following year, petitioning for reorganization under the Federal Bankruptcy Act. U.S. District Court Judge John Foster Symes appointed Denver's Henry Swan and McCarthy co-trustees. Thus began a two decade odyssey for McCarthy, the ultimate beneficiary being a rehabilitated Rio Grande. Despite its inability to pay interest on $122 million in debt, McCarthy and Swan worked to repair and rebuild the Rio Grande. In 1937 alone the two pumped $18 million into the property. Under McCarthy's administration, the Rio Grande built over 1,130 bridges and laid over two million ties. At one point during the Great Depression, the Rio Grande spent one million dollars a year for five years running. The road also bought its first new motive power in over ten years. By 1940 the McCarthy receivership spent over $20 million upgrading the Rio Grande. By the end of World War II, the Rio Grande's revenues increased from $17 million to $75 million per year. In 1942 alone, revenues increased by a staggering 905 percent. At the same time, the Rio Grande moved to trim or eliminate its fabled narrow gauge system. In conjunction with the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad it built the Dotsero Cut-Off (completed 1935). The Salt Lake and Denver and its vital Moffat Tunnel line (completed 1927) were absorbed, anchoring the Rio Grande between Salt Lake City, Utah, and Denver, Colorado. This allowed the Rio Grande to cut its freight time between these two points from 54 to under 24 hours. Again working with Ralph Budd of the Burlington, McCarthy, in conjunction with the Western Pacific Railroad, began the streamlined California Zephyr service between Chicago, Illinois, and the Bay Area. During McCarthy's tenure the train's signature vista-dome cars were added. Civically minded, McCarthy worked to help bring Geneva Steel to Utah, promoted stock shows in Colorado, and served on the planning commission celebrating the centennial of the arrival of Mormon pioneers in Salt Lake in 1947. In 1947 the Rio Grande emerged from the co-trusteeship. The Interstate Commerce Commission approved a reorganization plan. Though opposed to the U.S. Supreme Court by both the Missouri Pacific Railroad and the Western Pacific Railroad, the reorganization committee elected a new board of directors, naming John Evans chairman and McCarthy president. (The MP and WP controlled the Rio Grande for a period beginning October 29, 1924, under the planning of George J. Gould and Benjamin Franklin Bush.) Though passenger traffic waned in the wake of World War II, McCarthy's efforts to develop agriculture and industry along the Rio Grande's routes paid off in heavier traffic loads and increased receipts. He died in 1956 and was succeeded by Gale B. Aydelott, president of the Rio Grande through 1977.  Personal life  McCarthy married Minerva Woolley on June 22, 1910. They had five children together. McCarthy suffered a stroke while in Washington, D.C., and he died at Holy Cross Hospital in 1956. His funeral was presided over by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints President David O. McKay. On the day of his funeral, every Rio Grande train stopped at 11 a.m. and their crews observed two minutes of silence. After his death, the Rio Grande renamed their business car No. 100 as the Wilson McCarthy. (The car was renamed Kansas when the Rio Grande absorbed the Southern Pacific circa January, 1986.)

In the episode, Thomas C. Durant (Colm Meaney) and Lily Bell (Dominique McElligott) travel by train to Chicago, for different reasons; the Irishmen from Hell On Wheels intend to kill Elam (Common) to entertain themselves, but Cullen Bohannon (Anson Mount) interferes and helps Elam escape. Plot The episode opens with a flashback. Young Elam Ferguson (Amadou Diallo) reads aloud from the Bible. Elam's \\"owner\\" and father (Trevor Leigh) has made a bet with his friends that slaves can be taught to read. The master's friends voice their concerns over this, but the master proves that Elam does not comprehend anything he just read. Later, with his fellow slaves, Elam recites another biblical passage. This particular one is about God's promising to deliver the Israelites from slavery. In the present, Thomas C. Durant escorts Lily Bell to Chicago. She plans to meet with her deceased husband's family, while Durant plans to meet with Senator Crane (James D. Hopkin) to settle the railroad's financial difficulty. Meanwhile, Eva (Robin McLeavy) begs Cullen to save Elam. The Swede (Christopher Heyerdahl) is allowing the Irish crew to hang Elam as entertainment. At the saloon, Toole (Duncan Ollerenshaw) strings Elam up, while Cullen charges in on horseback, shoots one man holding the rope, and tells Elam to ride off on one of the horses outside. Cullen cautions the Irish against pursuing them, then he and Elam ride out of town. Later, Bolan (Ian Tracey) and Dix (Diego Diablo Del Mar) lead a posse, which includes Toole, after the wanted men. Cullen and Elam stop far away from town. Cullen puts the blame on Elam for having sex with a white woman. By a campfire that night, Elam wonders what would happen if he owned a white woman, had a son by her, and educated the boy just enough that he considered himself different from his fellow white slaves. Reflecting on his own life, Elam concludes that, in truth, the boy wouldn't be different at all. Cullen tells Elam he freed his own slaves before the war to please his wife, realizing only later that she was right to make him do so. Following her murder, his barn was set on fire. The slave woman, who raised Cullen, died inside the barn trying to shield his son from the flames. The next morning, Cullen teaches Elam to shoot a gun. Elam misses all the targets. Cullen explains that the better thing to do is to count the rounds and make sure his opponent has to reload his weapon first. In the train coach, Durant tells Lily that he's figured a way out of his Crane situation. The Union Pacific needs a connecting route back to New York, and the two options are the Mississippi and Missouri Railroad and the R&R; Railroad. Durant believes Crane would do anything for a stock tip about Durant's choice. Durant delivers Lily to Robert's family's home in Chicago for what turns out to be a memorial gathering. Robert's sister Charlotte (Chantal Perron), wearing black, comments that Lily, dressed in red, must have already stopped mourning. Durant leaves Lily to go to Crane's office. The senator demands the stock tip outright and threatens Durant with prison for remaining silent. Durant tells him to invest in the R&R; railroad. Meanwhile, Lily hears Charlotte mention that Robert would still be alive if he hadn't tried to save Lily. When Lily interjects that she, not Robert, killed their attacker, Charlotte calls her a liar. Lily slaps Charlotte and describes ripping the arrow from her own shoulder and thrusting it into the Indian's throat. Bolan's men reach Cullen and Elam's camp, which appears abandoned. Bolan discovers warm horse feces and stands to warn the others about the ambush, but he gets shot in the chest. Before he dies, Bolan asks Cullen if he'll find peace on the other side. Cullen states that he doesn't know if men like them ever find peace, but he sure hopes that they will. Cullen kills two more men, and Elam a third. Toole slips into the woods and Elam gives chase. The two fire at each other until Toole maneuvers himself in front of Elam, gun drawn. Smiling, Elam says Toole's gun is empty and offers him last words, but cuts them off by shooting Toole in the mouth. Durant purchases the M&M; Railroad instead of the R&R.; He visits Crane's office, gloating over the senator's financial ruin. The deal has yielded Durant $5 million, covering the $147,000 missing from the Union Pacific's funds. Durant returns to the Bell house in time to hear Lily's account of the Indian massacre. When she finishes, he escorts her away. On the train back to Hell on Wheels, Lily tells Durant that she refuses to return to London and a life she now despises. Durant admires Lily, then tries to woo her. Meanwhile, standing among the bodies, Cullen finds a Bible and ponders reading a passage over the dead men. Elam suggests the 23rd Psalm. The two men recite it together, Elam from memory. Critical and popular reception Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic said, \\"the episode really captured the core characters in a way that was compelling and entertaining to watch.\\" New York Magazines Adam Raymond commented, \\"Hell on Wheels isn‚Äôt going to be the tension-filled, character-driven drama we all wanted it to be.\\" Phil Nugent of The A.V. Club stated, \\"I was rooting for some real action scenes to break [loose] on this show, and \\"Revelations\\" makes a couple of large-scale attempts to deliver the goods, but it's a case of too-clumsy-too-late.\\" The seventh episode was watched by 2.27 million viewers and had a 0.6 rating with the 18-49 age range ‚Äî gaining more viewers than the previous episode, while maintaining the same age range rating.

It allowed users to submit photographs or video anonymously, mainly nude, erotic and, sexually explicit images. The service was closely associated with the metalcore and post-hardcore music scene, also featuring and depicting numerous nude photos of musicians of these genres. Is Anyone Up? was subject to great controversy because of the prevalence of revenge porn submissions to the service, many of which were submitted by former romantic partners without consent and with malicious intent. Many of the submitted revenge porn images were obtained as a result of multiple email account hacks. The ongoing incidents resulted in numerous lawsuits and even death threats aimed at Hunter Moore, founder and owner of Is Anyone Up? The website was shut down on April 19, 2012. History and background Is Anyone Up? was founded in late 2010. Founder Hunter Moore stated that the idea for the site came from a woman who continually sent him suggestive pictures. He then created a blog hosting nude photographs from anyone and it eventually became isanyoneup.com. As of November 2011, the website was netting as much as $13,000 monthly. Moore said that he spent generally 12 hours, five days a week managing posts, and that the website had over 30 million page views a month. Another partner, Sam Boyd, also spent time moderating and filtering requests. Submissions to the website usually followed the same formula, depicting a person's social networking website profile thumbnail (such as their Facebook or Twitter profile), then showing images of them clothed, before revealing images of their genitalia. In some cases, images showed people engaging in sexual acts such as masturbation. Each submission line then ended with a \\"reaction image\\", usually showing a still or animated gif file of a popular scene or Internet meme as a satirical \\"reaction\\" to the images shown. Moore stated that he took legal precautions before uploading images to the site, initially verifying the age of the people whose photographs were submitted through social networking sites. He sent the IP information of people who submitted photos of underage individuals to a lawyer in Las Vegas, who turned it over to law enforcement. Another category on the site, called \\"Daily Hate\\", featured angry reactions from people who had their pictures posted without their consent. On April 19, 2012, Moore sold the website to James McGibney, who runs Bullyville.com, a site which allows anonymous people to share details about people who have bullied or harassed them. Moore posted an open letter to BullyVille.com and on the isanyoneup.com domain explaining his decision. Controversy Is Anyone Up? was the subject of much controversy. Many individuals sued Moore or those associated with the Is Anyone Up? domain for the display of their nude images on the website. While some images were self-submitted, others were \\"revenge porn\\", which has been described as being \\"pornographic souvenirs from relationships gone sour\\". In November 2011, Moore appeared on Anderson to discuss Is Anyone Up? while being confronted by two women who had been exposed on the website by an anonymous user. When one of the women criticized Moore for \\"helping\\" deceptive people who spread such photographs, he responded: \\"No one put a gun to your head and made you take these pictures. It's 2011, everything's on the Internet.\\" On August 21, 2012, BullyVille founder James McGibney posted an open letter to Hunter Moore on the main page of the isanyoneup domain, announcing a class action lawsuit and encouraging people to join in. Incidents Floridian rock band A Day to Remember refused to play at the 2011 Bamboozle festival, knowing Hunter Moore was in attendance. They demanded that he be removed from the venue because they objected to Moore's site hosting nude images of the band's bassist, Joshua Woodard, weeks beforehand. One morning in August 2011, Moore was attacked and stabbed with a pen by a woman featured on the website. Moore managed to escape with a shoulder wound that required surgery. In December 2011, social networking website Facebook reportedly threatened legal action against the website, blocked any linking to the isanyoneup.com domain through its site, and deleting the official \\"like\\" page from its database. FBI Investigation On May 16, 2012, The Village Voice reported that Moore and Is Anyone Up were the subject of an investigation by the FBI, as a large number of the pictures formerly hosted on the site were believed to have been illegally obtained by a hacker known as 'Gary Jones'. ABC Nightline revealed that the FBI investigation was started by Charlotte Laws after a photo of her daughter appeared on the website. In January 2014, Moore and his alleged aide Charles Evens were arrested by the FBI and indicted in a federal district court in California on charges of conspiracy, unauthorized access to a protected computer, and aggravated identity theft. In February 2015, Moore pled guilty to aggravated identity theft and aiding and abetting in the unauthorized access of a computer. On July 2, 2015, Charles Evens pleaded guilty to charges of computer hacking and identity theft, confessing to stealing hundreds of images from women's email accounts and selling them to Moore. U.S. District Judge Dolly M. Gee sentenced Evans to more than two years in jail and a fine of $2000. The same judge sentenced Moore in December 2015 to 2 1/2 years in a federal prison with three years supervision following his release. He also had to undergo a mental health evaluation and pay a $2000 fine. Popular culture German metalcore group Eskimo Callboy have a single named \\"Is Anyone Up?\\" that describes the site's general idea and attributes.Electronic band Blood on the Dance Floor released the album Evolution in 2012, containing the song \\"Revenge Porn\\" which references the site and Hunter Moore in the lyrics. Electropop group Millionaires released a remix of the Ludacris song \\"My Chick Bad\\" titled \\"My Chick Bad (Remix)\\" that contained lyrics discussing posting images on Is Anyone Up?.

Zirkle was elected to the National Academy of Science in 1959.The New York Times: SCIENCE ACADEMY GIVEN $1,000,000; Equitable Life Donates New Wing for Building -- 30 Members Are Elected Zirkle served on the editorial boards of seven journals.  Life and career  Zirkle was born in Springfield, Illinois. From 1915 to 1919 Ray attended West Plains High School, where he showed an aptitude for mathematics and took several engineering courses. After graduation he joined the Missouri National Guard and served for several years. In 1924 he married Mary Evelyn Ramsey, who spent her early years in a rural area of western Kansas and, similarly to Ray, received her primary education in a one-room country schoolhouse. They had two children, Raymond Jr. in 1927 and Thomas in 1929. Zirkle graduated from the University of Missouri with an A.B and Ph.D. in 1928 and 1932, respectively. In 1932 Zirkle joined the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia as a lecturer in biophysics and remained there until 1938. In 1940 Zirkle accepted a position as professor of biology at the Indiana University. During World War II Zirkle became one of the principals in the biological program of the Manhattan Project. His focus in the Manhattan Project was to study the effects on living systems from fast and slow neutrons, beta rays, and gamma rays. In 1944 Zirkle became a professor at the University of Chicago and in 1945 was appointed director of the Institute of Radiobiology and Biophysics at the university. Zirkle died in Castle Rock, Colorado in 1988.  Research  After receiving his doctorate Zirkle joined the Johnson Foundation for Medical Physics at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Initially he had a fellowship from the National Research Council, which had also supported his graduate studies. He remained at Penn as a Johnson Foundation fellow and a lecturer in biophysics until 1938. During this time he investigated the quantitative relationship between ionization per unit path of alpha particles and their biological effectiveness, which was not clear-cut from the data obtained up to that time. By placing fern spore (Aspergillus terreus) nuclei either near the beginning of the path (where the ionization density was low) or near the end of the path (where it was high) or in intermediate positions, he was able to calculate the number of alpha particles per nucleus that was necessary to produce a given effect, such as the inhibition of cell division. He found that the biological effectiveness is not only a function of the total number of ions formed in the nucleus but is also dependent on the variable concentration of ions formed in different portions of the path of the alpha particle. His data suggested the relationship B=kI^2.5, where B is the biological effectiveness per alpha particle, k a proportionality constant, and I the ionization per unit path. The quantitative aspect of this work was unusual for such studies at that time and established Ray Zirkle as a leader in the field of radiation biology. A generalization of these results to other types of radiation by Zirkle and others led to his later formulation of the concept of linear energy transfer. In 1940 Zirkle was appointed professor of biology at the Indiana University; however his academic career was interrupted during World War II when he became one of the principal investigators in the biological program of the Manhattan District. His research in this project was chiefly concerned with the comparative effects on living systems of fast and slow neutrons, beta rays, and gamma rays. A substantial part of the wartime research carried out under his direction was reported in several volumes of the National Nuclear Energy Series, of which he was the health editor. Much of the biological research in the Manhattan Project was carried out at sites where particular radiation sources were located, such as the Clinton Laboratories near Oak Ridge, Tennessee; the Radiation Laboratory at the University of California; the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland; and the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago, which later became the Argonne National Laboratory. Research at the latter site brought Zirkle into contact with many faculty members from the University of Chicago who shared common interests with him. Thus, it is perhaps not surprising that in 1944 he was offered and accepted a professorship there and that in 1945 he became director of the newly founded Institute of Radiobiology and Biophysics. This institute, like the Johnson Foundation, became a focal point for scientists and students with a penchant for physics and an interest in biological problems. The Zirkles purchased a home in Olympia Fields, south of Chicago, which had space for a large flower garden. In the late 1940s and early 1950s Zirkle continued his theoretical and experimental studies of the effects of radiation on living cells. As knowledge of the chemical composition of biological material began to accumulate, he attempted to relate the chemical effects caused by the absorption of radiant energy to the ultimate biological effects. He fully appreciated that an understanding of the multitude of diverse radiobiological effects‚Äîsuch as gene mutations, chromosome breaks, increased membrane permeability, inhibition of cell division, induction of neoplasms, and lethality of cells and organisms‚Äîwould require a detailed knowledge of the intervening chemical modifications. Yet, the level of knowledge of the molecular composition and dynamics of cellular constituents was still very primitive. The relationship of DNA and proteins to genes was still uncertain. Nothing was known about the existence of DNA repair mechanisms or the molecular basis of mitosis or the mechanisms responsible for cell proliferation and cell death. At this time one had to be content with discriminating direct from indirect effects of the radiation and for establishing criteria that could sort out the relevant chemical consequences of the ionization or excitation of molecules. Zirkle‚Äôs analyses provided a rational conceptual framework for dealing with this complex problem. Until now, the link between radiation physics and biological damage is still to established.

Distraction-conflict is an alternative to the first tenet in Zajonc's theory of social facilitation. This first tenet currently seems to be more widely supported than the distraction-conflict model. Zajonc formulates that the presence of an individual generates arousal, and this arousal facilitates well-learned tasks and inhibits complex tasks. The distraction- conflict model states, \\"in the presence of others there is a conflict between attending to the person and attending to the task\\". The distraction-conflict model calls this attentional conflict, and says that it is responsible for the arousal of the subject. An attentional conflict occurs between multiple stimuli when the subject is interested in paying attention to each stimulus. The task that is unrelated to the subject's primary goal is referred to as the distraction. This conflict only occurs when the pressure to attend to each input is equal and the individual's cognitive capacities to do so are inadequate. It has been argued that the distraction-attention theory suggests that \\"distraction during a simple task will improve performance if it triggers attentional conflict\\". As with Zajonc's theory of social facilitation, the distraction-conflict theory observes that an individual's performance on simple tasks is facilitated by arousal, whereas an individual's performance on complex tasks is hindered by this same arousal. For this to occur, the level of distraction must be related to performance so that benefits of increased drive outweigh the costs of disruption. Distraction-conflict, as well as social uncertainty and self-attention, may \\"provoke resource overload because they absorb attentional capacity\\". This model more broadly predicts that any attentional conflict will produce drive. Distraction-conflict has been supported by several studies which have produced results showing that \\"distractions, such as noise or flashing lights, have the same drivelike effects on task performance that audiences do\\". This is because \\"our attention is divided between the task at hand and observing the reactions of the people in the audience\\" in much the same way how one is distracted from the task at hand by sounds or flashing lights. The effects of distraction-conflict are also shown to be the strongest when there is a sense of urgency.  Major empirical findings  In their initial research in 1978, Sanders, Baron, and Moore hypothesized that subjects would be more distracted when performing a task with a coactor or an audience than when working alone. The researchers hoped to demonstrate this through a paired-word task. In this study, subjects first had anticipation trials on a practice list, where the lead word in a pair was presented and subject attempted to guess the attached response word. Subjects were assigned a competitional list (a complex list where the lead words were associated) or a noncompetitional list (a simple list where the pairs of words were related). An audience was introduced between the practice and subsequent test trials. The measure of performance was the total errors divided by the word pairs on the list. The distraction experienced by the subject was measured by a self-report of task attention and the recall errors. The researchers found that the presence of audiences impaired performance on the complex list and assisted performance on the simpler task. Sanders, Baron, and Moore asserted that this data indicated increased distraction in the presence of an audience. The researchers concluded that the subject's arousal and the accompanying effects were due in part to distraction.  Others as distractors  One question surrounding this theory was what the actual source of distraction was when in the presence of another person. In 1978, Sanders, Baron, and Moore argued that distraction could occur if \\"subjects wanted to get social comparison information from the other person. In an experiment, they set up a copying task in three different conditions: alone, with someone else doing the same task, and with someone else doing a different task, and hypothesized that only in the case where the other person present was doing the same task would social comparison, and therefore distraction, be occurring. The researchers hypothesized people are distracting because of the pressure to engage in social comparison, and this pressure enhances social facilitation effects. Participants performed a copying task in two conditions. Some participants were told the study was about their impressions of the task, so that the subject experienced little comparison pressure. The other participants were told the study was about the ability to defer gratification, thus making it likely students would compare their performances with a coactor. Sanders, Baron, and Moore found that subjects were motivated to compare their performances with coactors, causing distraction. They observed that social facilitation effects were connected to this distraction.  Recent findings  Huguet et al. (1999) examined the effects of social presence in the Stroop test. The researchers had participants complete this task alone or with a coactor. This coactor worked on the task more slowly, worked at the same speed, or worked faster than the participant. The researchers found that Stroop interference decreased for participants who worked with a similarly paced or more quickly paced coactor. The results indicate that participants engaged in social comparison with the coactor, and that this comparison created distraction. A 2004 study performed by Muller, Atzeni, and Butera found support for the attentional conflict hypothesis of the distraction- conflict model. Subjects were randomly assigned a condition: alone, upward social comparison (the coactor was better at task) or downward social comparison (the coactor was worse at task) and were asked to complete a task indicating the presence of \\"$\\" in various pictures. The researchers found that coaction decreased the errors committed by the subjects when in the condition of upward social comparison. The authors concluded that it is possible for coactors to be objects of social comparison, and thus, distracting.  Shortcomings of the distraction-conflict model  The major shortcomings of distraction-conflict theory result from limitations in data and possible alternative interpretations. The 1978 study performed by Sanders, Baron, and Moore recognizes that the outcomes do not establish distraction as the only feature increasing arousal. Furthermore, the authors note: > The measures [of distraction] did not correlate significantly with each > other or with performance; they often did not produce significant > differences between conditions; they occasionally failed to parallel and > even reversed the trends from relevant performance data. Current research has not yet definitely identified distraction as the primary cause of increased drive.

That was a pilot for a series that never eventuated; Bruning calls this film \\"the first of the true-all film tele features\\". It was the first of an initial order of four films for Channel Seven made through Bruning's Gemini Productions. \\"There is no way it will develop into a series,\\" said Bruning of the movie. \\"It was written and produced as a complete feature.\\" The film was shot in Sydney. Reception Critical A writer from the Sydney Morning Herald praised the \\"superb cast\\" and said the story had them \\"on the edge of my seat, horrifically hypnotised.\\" Ratings The film rated very well on Channel 7 and was picked up by Paramount to distribute internationally. The success of the film enabled Bruning to make a series of TV movies for Australian TV. In particular, Channel 7 bought three more movies off Bruning, Mama's Gone A-Hunting (1977), The Alternative (1977) and Gone to Ground (1977). Bruning later sold Gemini to Grundy Productions and the film would be the first in a series of eleven telemovies from Grundys that were syndicated.

LaMacchia 871 F.Supp. 535 (D.Mass. 1994) was a case decided by the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts which ruled that, under the copyright and cybercrime laws effective at the time, committing copyright infringement for non-commercial motives could not be prosecuted under criminal copyright law. The ruling gave rise to what became known as the LaMacchia Loophole which is that criminal charges of fraud or copyright infringement would be dismissed under current legal standards, so long as there was no profit motive involved. The court's ruling explicitly drew attention to a perceived shortcoming of the law that there was no criminal liability under the Copyright Act for even large-scale non-commercial copyright infringement. The NET Act, passed in 1997, was a direct response to the \\"LaMacchia Loophole.\\" The law provides for criminal prosecution of individuals who engage in copyright infringement even when there is no commercial benefit from the infringement. Facts The defendant in the case was David LaMacchia, a 21-year-old student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at that time. Under pseudonyms and using an encrypted address, LaMacchia set up an electronic bulletin board which he dubbed Cynosure. He then encouraged people to upload copyrighted software applications and computer games to the board, which he subsequently transferred to another encrypted address called Cynosure II, where the software could be accessed and downloaded freely by anyone with access to the Cynosure password. LaMacchia encouraged his correspondents to exercise caution when accessing the site, but despite his best efforts to avoid detection, the heavy traffic to his site drew the attention of university and government authorities. Indictment and motion to dismiss On April 7, 1994, LaMacchia was indicted by a federal grand jury for \\"conspiring with unknown people\\" to violate 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343, the wire fraud statute. The indictment held that LaMacchia had devised a scheme to defraud the software manufacturers and copyright owners whose software had been distributed on Cynosure without paying proper licensing fees and royalties, thereby causing losses totaling over one million USD. There was no allegation that LaMacchia had derived any personal profit from the scheme, which is why the indictment was not made on grounds of copyright infringement. In response to the indictment, LaMacchia brought a motion to dismiss on September 30, 1994, under the argument that the government was misapplying the wire fraud statute and attempting to use it as a copyright enforcement tool. LaMacchia made reference to Dowling v. United States, 473 U.S. 207 (1985) in his motion, arguing that the case held that \\"copyright prosecutions for alleged copyright infringement must be brought, if at all, under the Copyright Act, and cannot be brought under statutes enacted by Congress to prohibit interstate theft and fraud\\". The reasoning in Dowling v. United States was that the transfer of a copyright is different from the transfer of physical property in that unlike the owner of ordinary chattel, the holder of a copyright does not \\"acquire exclusive dominion over the thing owned\\". Therefore, LaMacchia argued, the prosecution must be brought under copyright law, and not under claims of wire fraud. Court decision In its ruling, the court upheld the Dowling decision that copyright prosecutions should only be brought under Section 506 of the Copyright Act, which did not at the time apply to cases not involving commercial profit from infringement. Therefore, LaMacchia was not held liable for criminal copyright infringement under the wire fraud statute, and the case was concluded. This ruling does not preclude LaMacchia from being prosecuted under a civil suit as it specifically applies to criminal prosecution under the Copyright Act. The court considered the wire fraud statute in analyzing the case. The wire fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1343, has jurisdiction over \\"any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises\\". The word \\"or\\" in this specification implies two separate offenses possible under the statute, the first of which is simply the devising of a scheme to defraud, and not necessarily an attempt to obtain money or property by false pretenses. Therefore, unlike 17 U.S.C. Sec. 506(a), which outlines the criminal copyright statute, wire fraud does not require a defendant to have sought personal profit in the scheme to defraud. Remembering the Dowling precedent, the court considered that a nondisclosure or concealment of activities from copyright holders with the objective of depriving them of due royalties or licensing fees may serve as a basis for a fraudulent scheme. A stipulation was made that a \\"non-disclosure can only serve as a basis for a fraudulent scheme when there exists an independent duty that has been breached by the person so charged\\", which can include either a fiduciary duty or an explicit statutory duty. The court then found a fundamental difference between the cases of Dowling and LaMacchia. Neither party held any fiduciary duty to the copyright owners, but Dowling had a statutory duty as specified by the Copyright Act requiring that vendors notify copyright owners of any intention to manufacture and distribute song records (which were the physical goods in question). In the case of LaMacchia, however, no such independent statutory duty of disclosure exists because there was no analogous compulsory software licensing scheme. LaMacchia was therefore not guilty of defrauding the copyright holders, which addresses the claims of wire fraud. NET Act Although the court ruled that the Supreme Court decision in Dowling v. United States precluded LaMacchia's prosecution for criminal copyright infringement, Justice Richard Stearns, while writing the memorandum, stated that \\"If the indictment is to be believed, one might at best describe [LaMacchia's] action's as heedlessly irresponsible, and at worst as nihilistic, self-indulgent, and lacking in any fundamental sense of values.\\" He asserted that this ruling was a result of a shortcoming of copyright law and that it was the power of the legislature rather than the Court to modify the law to prevent such a crime to go unpunished. Stearns also said that it was impossible to prosecute LaMacchia under the then-present felony wire-fraud statutes unless the government made criminal \\"the myriad of home computer users who succumb to the temptation to copy even a single software program for private use.\\" This loophole became known as the LaMacchia Loophole, and the No Electronic Theft Act was passed in 1997 to close the loophole. The NET Act modifies 17 U.S.C., Chapter 5, to include some forms of non-commercial infringement in its definition of criminal infringement. For example, if the infringer has made ten or more copies of one or more copyrighted works with a total retail value over $2,500 within a period of 180 days, even without any private gain, this would constitute a felony punishable by up to five years of imprisonment and/or a fine of up to $250,000.

The cat is displaying defensive posture typical of interactions between a cat and dog that have not been socialized. A kitten and a dog that have been socialized and interact with each other without aggression. Cats and a dog sitting together. Cats and dogs have a range of interactions. The natural instincts of each species lead towards antagonistic interactions, though individual animals can have non-aggressive relationships with each other, particularly under conditions where humans have socialized non-aggressive behaviors. The generally aggressive interactions between the species have been noted in cultural expressions. In domestic homes where dog and cat are reared and trained properly they tend to relate well with each other, especially when their owner is taking good care of them. Range of relationships A kitten is taking rest on the back of a street dog The signals and behaviors that cats and dogs use to communicate are different and can lead to signals of aggression, fear, dominance, friendship or territoriality being misinterpreted by the other species. Dogs have a natural instinct to chase smaller animals that flee, an instinct common among cats. Most cats flee from a dog, while others take actions such as hissing, arching their backs and swiping at the dog. After being scratched by a cat, some dogs can become fearful of cats. If appropriately socialized, cats and dogs may have relationships that are not antagonistic, and dogs raised with cats may prefer the presence of cats to other dogs. Even cats and dogs in the same household that have historically had positive interactions may revert to aggressive reactions due to external stimuli, illness, or play that escalates. Cultural impact The phrase \\"fight like cats and dogs\\" reflects a natural tendency for the relationship between the two species to be antagonistic. Other phrases and proverbs include \\"The cat is mighty dignified until the dog comes by\\" and \\"The cat and dog may kiss, but are none the better friends.\\" A Russian legend explains the antipathy between dogs and cats by stating that the devil has tricked the dog and cat each into thinking the other has its rightful fur. Eugene Field's children's poem, \\"The Duel,\\" projects and amplifies the real-life antipathy between cats and dogs onto a stuffed gingham dog and a stuffed calico cat who had an all-night fight during which they \\"ate each other up.\\" In Fam Ekman's children's book Kattens Skrekk (The Cat's Terror), a cat visits a museum to find that all of the artworks, like Mona Lisa and Venus de Milo, have been replaced by parodies featuring dogs. The only piece not converted is The Scream which \\"symbolizes the cat's terror in the face of so many dogs.\\" The American animated television series CatDog features the adventures of the protagonist, CatDog, a genetically altered creature with the head of a dog on one side of its body and the head of a cat on the other. The episodes frequently play on \\"cats and dogs being what they are\\" to incorporate \\"a lot of running and chasing.\\" The comedy films Cats & Dogs, released in 2001, and its sequel Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore, released in 2010, both project and amplify the above-mentioned antipathy between dogs and cats into an all-out war between the two species wherein cats are shown as being out-and-out enemies of humans, whereas dogs are shown as being more sympathetic to humans. Adlai Stevenson invoked the dog-cat conflict in his explanation of a veto he delivered as governor of Illinois: \\"If we attempt to resolve [this problem] by legislation, who knows but what we may be called upon to take sides as well in the age-old problems of dog versus cat, bird versus bird, even bird versus worm.\\" (Bartleby's, 1989) See also *Interspecies friendship *Human‚Äìcanine bond *Dog *Cat References Dogs as pets Cats as pets Dog training and behavior Animal communication ","title":"Cat‚Äìdog relationship"},{"id":"34100980","text":"Natalia Saratovtseva is a retired Russian football defender, also represented Azerbaijan.

The player controls an explorer who has obtained an ancient relic and is running from demonic monkeys who are chasing him. The game was initially released for iOS devices on August 4, 2011, and later ported to Android systems and Windows Phone 8. The game was a commercial success with positive reviews from critics. The success of the game led to a sequel Temple Run 2. Collaborations with Disney to create Temple Run: Brave and Temple Run: Oz, and a third spin-off in development by Scopely titled, Temple Run: Treasure Hunters as a match-three video game. Temple Run also received activity books and a board game, with Warner Bros. Studios talking with Imangi Studios of a possible film adaptation. The success of the game also inspired many similar games that take their own twist but also copycat games that copy the Temple Run gameplay and iconic brand of the original. Gameplay Gameplay of Temple Run In Temple Run, the player controls either Guy Dangerous, an explorer, Scarlett Fox, an escape artist, Barry Bones, a city cop, Karma Lee, the fastest runner in the Far East, Montana Smith, the \\"second greatest explorer ever\\" (referring to Indiana Jones being the greatest explorer), Francisco Montoya, a Spanish conquistador, or Zack Wonder, a football star. The character chosen will embark on an adventure to seek an ancient and valuable golden idol from an Aztec temple. They will not realize that the temple is inhabited by a family of demonic monkeys who want to devour them. As the game is an endless running game, there is no end to the temple; the player plays until the character collides into a large obstacle, falls into the water or is overtaken by the demon monkeys. While the character is running, the player can swipe left or right to move the character to either side of the screen to collect coins and/or avoid obstacles. There are three types of coins to be found while the character is running: gold, red, and blue. A gold coin will only add one coin to the player's total number of coins. Red coins are worth two coins, while blue coins are worth three. The coins can be used to buy and then upgrade power-ups and/or other characters. Coins can also be bought by the player through in-app purchases with payments of actual money. When the player needs to turn left or right, the touchscreen can be swiped in the corresponding direction. If the player wishes to jump over an object, the screen can be swiped upwards; if the player wishes to slide under an object, the screen can be swiped downwards. Development Temple Run was designed, programmed and produced by husband-and-wife team Keith Shepherd and Natalia Luckyanova with art by Kiril Tchangov. The game took a total of four months to develop. Development began after the financial failure of Imangi Studio's previous game, Max Adventure and used that game to prototype Temple Run's controls. Imangi Studios wanted to make a quick game with simpler controls in contrast from Max Adventure's dual analog controls. Keith started the first prototype with making a game where the character is always running and can be controlled by rotating the environment from a top- down perspective. This idea was scrapped due to causing extreme dizziness during testing. To fix the problem, constraints were added so that players can only make 90¬∞ turns and perspective be fixed behind the character. When it came to the game's aesthetics, multiple ideas were conceptualized but ultimately settled for the character to running on a pathway resembling the Great Wall of China or Aztec temple. After the temple design was solidified, Imangi Studios questioned the player character's motivation for constantly running without any breaks and came up with the idea of having something chasing him. Imangi Studios originally had the aliens from Max Adventure as placeholders. Kiril created the design of evil demon monkeys and gave them skull masks due to his desire of adding skulls in games he's involved in. Natalia initially did not like having evil demon monkeys chasing the player character and found them terrifying. Keith and Kiril, however, liked the evil demon monkeys and convinced Natalia to remain in the final product. Natalia later admitted that they were right and that it added immediacy and adrenaline. The coin and gem mechanic was originally different colored gems where player would receive different bonus depending on what combination of gems were obtained, similar to Poker hand rankings but was proven too difficult to achieve and was scrapped. Natalia mentioned coins and Gems were particularly frustrating to add into the game that at one point were removed during development, but were added back due to the team missing them. Release The game was released on the App Store on August 4, 2011. The game was originally for 99 cents to download, but was switched to freemium prior to December 2011. After the release of its sequel Temple Run 2, the game renamed to Temple Run: Classic. On January 12, 2012, Imangi Studios announced on the Temple Run Facebook page that the game would be released for the Android platform in February. The game was released on Google Play on March 27, 2012, a month later than expected. As Temple Run was originally released with a custom, flexible engine on iOS, there were some difficulties when it was ported to Android, primarily related to the use of the Unity game engine. The game frequently crashed, occasionally caused devices to overheat, and drained battery life extremely quickly. This led to generally unfavourable reviews. On March 27, 2013, the game was released for Windows Phone 8. An Arcade version was developed by Coastal Amusements and released on 2012. The arcade version was discontinued some time after. Related media In November 2013, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Warner Bros. Pictures and producer David Heyman were in talks with Imangi Studios to make a movie version of Temple Run. In July 2014 a Temple Run fiction series and an activity book was published by Egmont Publishing. The series is called Run For Your Life, with the first four titles called Jungle Trek, Doom Lagoon, Arctic Rescue and Pyramid Peril. The series is a \\"choose-your-own-ending\\" series aimed at fans of the game and books like Beast Quest. The activity book, Temple Run Downloaded is shaped like a tablet and includes Temple Run info, character profiles, mazes and brain teasers.  Reception Popularity and accolades Since its initial release on the App Store, the popularity of the game has soared, to the point that Imangi Studios became more popular than Zynga. In the iTunes Store, the game was included in the top 50 most- downloaded apps in December 2011, and eventually became the number one free iOS app in the Store. It also reached the position of the top grossing iOS app. The Android version was downloaded one million times within three days of its release. As of June 2014, Temple Run and its sequel have been downloaded over 1 billion times. The Arcade version won the 2013 BOSA Awards bronze medal for Videmption Arcade Games. Critical response Temple Run has been generally well received. The iOS version holds an aggregate score of 80 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 10 reviews. Phillip Levin of 148Apps praised the gameplay but criticizing the backgrounds; \\"my big qualm with Temple Run lies in the fact that the majority of the game's scenery looks the same. Yeah, the scenery does change here and there, but most of the time, gamers are running through ruined, temple pathways that look consistently the same. It all starts to blur together after a while.\\" AppSpy Andrew Nesvadba was more impressed, writing \\"Temple Run tightens up and polishes the endless-runner for the 3rd dimension, giving players a unique and fun challenge that controls like a dream.\\" TouchArcade Nissa Campbell praising its move away from the \\"one button jumping control system\\" of most endless runners, as well as the game's milieu; \\"Any endless runner worth the name will give you high-tension situations and that \\"one more time\\" compulsion. But Temple Run is probably the only one that also makes you feel like a daring archaeologist with a penchant for deadly situations.\\" Gamezebo's Art Green called it \\"an instant iPhone classic,\\" and writing \\"addictive doesn't even accurately describe the game. Enthralling gameplay as the game speeds up. Objectives add goals that keep you playing.\\" Slide to Play Andrew Webster praised the upgrade system, 3D graphics, and controls, concluding \\"Even if you think you're sick of automatic runners, Temple Run proves there's still much life left in the genre. It matches the sheer thrill and intensity of Canabalt, but with a completely new theme and perspective. We've all wanted to be Indiana Jones at some point, and now's your chance.\\" IGN's Justin Davis praised the game's depth and upgrade system, which he felt distinguished it from other endless runners, such as Canabalt and Robot Unicorn Attack. He concluded that \\"Temple Run is a fast and frenzied iPhone experience. The combination of swiping and tilt controls give each session a frantic feeling [...] Gamers craving a new iOS time waster should give Temple Run a long look.\\" PC Magazine Laarni Almendrala Ragaza called the initial Android version \\"crisp\\", with \\"snappy\\" navigation. They also included it in their \\"Mobile Apps to keep Kids Happy\\" list. Legacy Copycats In the wake of Temple Run success, other developers created games of a similar style, such as Temple Guns, Temple Jump, Piggy Run, Zombie Run and Pyramid Run. Imangi Studios co-founder Keith Shepherd found it flattering that developers were inspired by the game to create interesting games that make them unique. However also found it frustrating when developers took exact gameplay, iconic branding, and use assets from their original game. This led to many of the copycat games from indie developer Anton Sinelnikov being removed from the App store. Sequels and spin-offs Temple Run was followed by several sequels and Spin-offs, becoming the first game in the Temple Run series. The second entry in the series is Temple Run: Brave and is a spin-off based on the film, Brave. It was released on Android and iOS on June 14, 2012. The third entry in the series is Temple Run 2 and serves as the direct sequel to Temple Run. Temple Run 2 was released on iOS on January 16, 2013 The fourth entry is Temple Run: Oz and is the second spin-off in the series, now based on the film, Oz the Great and Powerful.

He would be the one who formally bestowed Yang Xingmi's sons and successors Yang Wo and Yang Longyan with their formal titles on behalf of the Tang emperor during the initial years of the Yang family-ruled state of Wu (also known as Hongnong). In 918, after the general Zhu Jin assassinated Xu Zhixun the son of Wu's regent Xu Wen, Xu Wen believed that Li was complicit in Zhu's plot and put him to death.  Background  It is not known when Li Yan was born. He was originally named Zhang Xiu, and later also became known as Zhang Bo, and was a younger, if not youngest, son of the chancellor Zhang Jun. Because of his heritage, he came to serve in the imperial government during the reign of Emperor Zhaozong, initially serving as a copyeditor (Ê†°Êõ∏ÈÉé, Xiaoshulang) at the Palace Library, eventually becoming a general of the imperial guards.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms (ÂçÅÂúãÊò•Áßã), vol. 8.  As Emperor Zhaozong's emissary   During Tang Dynasty  As of 902, Emperor Zhaozong was at Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), having been forcibly taken there by the powerful eunuchs, led by Han Quanhui, as the eunuchs feared a general slaughter by Emperor Zhaozong and the chancellor Cui Yin. (Fengxiang was then under the rule of the eunuch's ally Li Maozhen.) Cui summoned his ally, the major warlord Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) to put Fengxiang's capital Fengxiang Municipality under siege.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 262. In 902, Emperor Zhaozong, perhaps at the eunuchs' behest, gave Zhang Bo the imperial clan surname of Li and the new name of Yan, sending Li Yan as his personal representative to Huainan Circuit to commission its military governor Yang Xingmi as the supreme commander of the southeastern circuits, honorary chancellor title of Zhongshu Ling (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰ª§), and the Prince of Wu and ordering him to organize a major attack on Zhu's territory. The bestowment also granted Yang permission to exercise imperial powers in the emperor's absence. Part of Li Yan's mission was also to bestow various honors on Yang's subordinates Zhu Jin and Zhu Yanshou, as well as on the independent warlords Feng Hongduo (then ruling the Shangyuan (‰∏äÂÖÉ, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu) region) and Ma Yin (then the military governor of Wu'an Circuit (Ê≠¶ÂÆâ, headquartered in modern Changsha, Hunan), apparently hoping that Feng and Ma would join Yang's attack on Zhu. (Feng and Ma, however, did not, although Feng would soon be defeated, and his territory absorbed into that of, Yang's subordinate Tian Jun the military governor of Ningguo Circuit (ÂØßÂúã, headquartered in modern Xuancheng, Anhui).) Yang did launch an attack on Zhu later in 902, but, running into food supply issues, withdrew shortly after. It was said that, after Li Yan bestowed on him the imperial authorities, Yang, while establishing an office to issue edicts on the emperor's behalf, would nevertheless inform Li Yan and present the proposed edicts to a statute of Emperor Zhaozong's ancestor Emperor Xuanzong before issuing them.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 263. In 903, Zhu, who at that point had prevailed over Li Maozhen, forced Li Maozhen to surrender the emperor to him to sue for peace, and slaughtered the eunuchs, was planning on seizing the throne eventually. He feared that Li Yan's father Zhang Jun, who had by that point retired to his estate in Changshui (Èï∑Ê∞¥, in modern Luoyang, Henan), would incite the regional governors to rise against him, and therefore had the entire family killed. Only Li Yan's older brother Zhang Ge escaped to Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 264. In 905, Yang Xingmi died. His subordinates met with Li Yan and requested Li Yan to bestow on his son and designated successor Yang Wo the titles of military governor of Huainan, supreme commander of the southeastern circuits, honorary chancellor title of Shizhong (‰æç‰∏≠), and Prince of Hongnong ‚Äî a lesser title to Yang Xingmi's Prince of Wu title. Li Yan did so.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 265.  During Hongnong/Wu  In 907, Zhu Quanzhong had Emperor Zhaozong's son and successor Emperor Ai yield the throne to him, ending Tang and starting a new Later Liang with him as its Emperor Taizu. Several regional governors, including Yang Wo, Li Maozhen, Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), and Wang Jian the military governor of Xichuan, refused to recognize the Later Liang emperor. Wang Jian founded his own state of Former Shu, while Yang, Li Maozhen, and Li Keyong theoretically remained vassals of the defunct Tang state, but were in effect sovereigns of their own separate states (Hongnong, Qi, and Jin respectively).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. In 908, Yang Wo was assassinated by his guard commanders Zhang Hao and Xu Wen, who declared his younger brother Yang Longyan the new Prince of Hongnong. Xu soon killed Zhang and took over as regent of the Hongnong state. Under the requests of the Hongnong officials, Li Yan, still serving as Emperor Zhaozong's representative, bestowed on Yang Longyan the titles of military governor of Huainan, the supreme commander of the eastern circuits, honorary chancellor title of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), and Prince of Hongnong. In 910, Wan Quangan (Ëê¨ÂÖ®ÊÑü), the emissary that Yang Longyan sent to Qi to deliver the news of Yang Wo's death, returned to Hongnong, and declared that Li Maozhen had, in the name of the Tang emperor, bestowed on Yang Longyan the title of Zhongshu Ling and ordered that he inherit Yang Xingmi's greater title of Prince of Wu. Yang Longyan accepted and declared a general pardon within Wu territory.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 267. Still, apparently believing that this was insufficiently formal, in 912, Xu, along with the senior Wu generals Liu Wei (ÂäâÂ®Å) and Tao Ya (Èô∂ÈõÖ), went to see Li Yan and requested that he, as Emperor Zhaozong's representative, bestow the Prince of Wu title on Yang Longyan and also give him the title of Taishi (Â§™Â∏´, one of the Three Excellencies). Li Yan did so.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 268. By 918, Xu had left the Wu capital Guangling (Âª£Èôµ) and was taking up defensive position at Sheng Prefecture (ÊòáÂ∑û, i.e., Shangyuan), leaving his son Xu Zhixun as the junior regent at Guangling, overseeing the policy decisions of the Wu government. Xu Zhixun, however, was arrogant and violent, alienating the other Wu officials and generals, including Zhu Jin, who, as titularly the deputy supreme commander of the circuits, carried a higher position than Xu Zhixun, formally. Xu Zhixun tried to send Zhu out of the capital by making him the military governor of a new Jinghuai Circuit (ÈùúÊ∑Æ, headquartered at modern Huai'an, Jiangsu). Zhu, angered, assassinated him but then committed suicide after being cornered by Xu Wen's subordinate Zhai Qian (ÁøüËôî). By that point, Li Yan had been residing at Hailing (Êµ∑Èôµ, in modern Taizhou, Jiangsu) and was said to be in poverty.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 270. As he was friendly with Zhu, Xu Wen believed that he was complicit in Zhu's assassination of Xu Zhixun, and so had Li executed, along with the general Mi Zhicheng (Á±≥ÂøóË™†), whom he also suspected of collaborating with Zhu. It was said that the people, knowing that Li was not involved, lamented his death.

The fifteenth named storm and twelfth hurricane of the active season, it developed from a tropical disturbance about 185 miles (300 km) south of Acapulco on September 17\\\\. Curving towards the northwest, Odile became a Category 1 hurricane on September 19\\\\. The tropical cyclone reached its peak intensity with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) two days later; however, Hurricane Odile began to weaken as moved erratically it encountered less favorable conditions and was downgraded to a tropical storm shortly before making landfall northwest of Zihuatanejo. Over land, the storm rapidly weakened, and dissipated on September 23\\\\. The storm caused significant rainfall accumulations of 24.73 inches (628.1 mm) in Southern Mexico, resulting in severe damage to tourism resorts. Flooding from Odile resulted in the evacuation of 7,000 people, 21 deaths, and the damage of about 900 homes. Meteorological history A tropical disturbance was first noted about south of Acapulco on September 16\\\\. After tracking over waters, the disturbance began to strengthen, and became a depression at 1800 UTC on September 17\\\\. The depression began to curve more towards the northwest beneath a narrow ridge located over southern Mexico and south of an upper- level low over northern Mexico. About 24 hours after developing into a tropical cyclone, the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC) upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Odile. By 0000 UTC September 20, the EPHC reported that Odile had attained hurricane status while turning towards the east between the ridge and an upper-level low. Late on September 21, Hurricane Odile reached its peak intensity of 105 mph (165 km/h) (a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale) as it approached Acapulco. Due to a combination of an upper level trough that moved southward over the Baja California Peninsula and the weakening of the ridge, the hurricane began to turn more northwestward. After maintaining peak intensity for 12 hours, Odile started to weaken, as the storm began to encounter cooler sea surface temperatures. The hurricane rapidly weakened to tropical storm status while approaching the coast of Mexico; within a six-hour period, the winds diminished from to . By late on September 22, Odile made landfall about northwest of Zihuatanejo, with winds of . Less than six hours later, at 0000 UTC on September 23, Odile ceased to exist as a tropical cyclone. While its surface circulation rapidly weakened over the mountains of western Mexico, the remnants of Odile moved northwest, passing east of Manzanillo before weakening as it re-curved towards Texas. Preparations and impact Rainfall totals in Mexico Heavy rainfall was recorded across Southern Mexico, with the maximum rainfall totals in Costa Azul and Acapulco, where it caused of rainfall. In all, Odile and a few other systems brought the heaviest rains to the region since 1978. Acapulco Mayor Alfonso Arugdin Alcaraz reported that flooding damaged roughly 900 homes, inundated of highways, triggered an evacuation of 7,000 people, and left 20,000 families without water service. However, these reports were not confirmed because telephone circuits between Acapulco and Mexico City were down. Commercial flights in Acapulco were suspended on September 21, only to be resumed on September 23, though the airline terminal remained flooded by more than of water. Cites such as Zihuatanejo along the coast were left without electricity since the hurricane had knocked down two high-tension towers. A total of 44 riverbanks and 30,000 residents were isolated due to flooding. Eighteen passengers and three crewman drowned on the Atoyac River. In addition, tourism resorts in Acapulco and Ixtapa-Zihuatenejo suffered severe damage. Officials estimated that hotels were only 5% full.

The acronym may stand for Verbindung nach Kaulsdorf (connection to Kaulsdorf); Verbindung nach K√ºstrin (connection to K√ºstrin) or von und nach (from and to) Kaulsdorf or K√ºstrin are common interpretations. The western part of the line is still in operation. This single-track electrified line links the Stadtbahn with the Berlin outer ring (, BAR). History  Following the closure of the old Berlin Ostbahnhof in 1882 a connection from the Eastern Railway to the Stadtbahn was needed. A grade separated junction at today‚Äôs Ostkreuz, where the two lines separated was not possible because there was insufficient space. Therefore, a flying junction was built two and a half km further east on the Lower Silesian-M√§rkische Railway near Rummelsburg marshalling yard. An eight kilometre line was built that by-passed Lichtenberg station. It was opened for passenger services on 29 January 1901, primarily for long-distance services. After the Second World War, the new border with Poland ended long-distance traffic. Passenger trains to the east began in Strausberg or in Lichtenberg and no longer used the VnK line. The opening of the first section of the Outer freight ring (GAR) on 31 December 1940 included a 1.2 kilometre connecting curve to the VnK, the so-called Grabensprung curve. It achieved importance after the war when the northbound track leading to the GAR was dismantled in 1947-1948 for reparations. In 1948, a short-term trial was established of a passenger service operated with railcars from Berlin-Gr√ºnau station over the GAR, the Grabensprung curve and the eastern part of the VnK line to Kaulsdorf. A temporary halt was established at the junction of the Grabensprung curve and the VnK line. The service was stopped after a few months. In the autumn of 1966, the section between the two branches to and from the Outer ring was shut down. The eastern section of the line was converted in 1969 into a connecting line from the Outer ring from the south to Kaulsdorf. During the redesign of the Outer ring starting in the early 1970s a connection was built to the Eastern Railway at Biesdorf cross. As a result, the eastern section of the VnK line was no longer necessary. On 1 April 1978 the last train ran over the Grabensprung curve and the VnK line to Kaulsdorf. From 1985 to 1988, the U-Bahn line now called U 5 was partly built on the path of the former VnK line to H√∂now. The western section of the line from Rummelsburg to the Outer ring, however, remained in operation and served traffic from Berlin Ostbahnhof to the outer ring running north. After the re-opening of the Berlin Stadtbahn in 1998, Regional-Express and long-distance services of the Stadtbahn ran over this route especially towards Stralsund. After the opening of the new North‚ÄìSouth line through Berlin in May 2006, the importance of the VnK line was reduced. In 2009, it was only used by a pair of City Night Line services on the Munich‚ÄìBerlin-Lichtenberg route and a pair of trains between Potsdam and Szczecin for stock transfer.

The same members also played in the 90's in the cover band Double Trouble. Former members of Swedish Erotica have played with Yngwie Malmsteen, TNT, Vinnie Vincent, Treat, Black Ingvars, Shotgun Messiah, John Norum, Talisman and King Diamond.  History   Prehistory  The band was started in 1985 under the name \\"Swedish Beauty\\" by the members Magnus Axx (Axelsson, guitar), Ken \\"Ulf\\" Sandin (bass), Dag Ingebrigtsen, a former vocalist of the Norwegian band TNT, Dan Stomberg, a former guitarist in Madison, and drummer Magnus Nybratt. Stomberg was quickly replaced by Anders Allhage on guitar, best known as Andy La Rocque, guitarist of King Diamond since 1985 and who also played briefly with Death and Megadeth. This line-up played on a Norwegian album of Christmas themed rock songs with various vocalists: \\"The Gr√∏nne Glitrende 3 Og Dag\\"https://www.discogs.com/The-Gr%C3%B8nne- Glitrende-3-Og-Dag-The-Gr%C3%B8nne-Glitrende-3-Og-Dag/release/7765145. Nybratt then left the band and was replaced by Jamie Borger from Treat on drums. This line-up was not able to secure a record deal but Magnus Axx did not give up, changed the band name and hired new musicians.  Formation and early career  Swedish Erotica formed in 1987 with members Magnus Axx and Morgan Le Fay (Morgan Jensen) on guitar together with bassist Johnny D'Fox (Jonas T√•ngstr√∂m) and drummer Pete Sanders (Petter Sv√§rd) who was soon replaced by BC Strike (Bjarne Johansson). First singer was G√∂ran Edman, a former member of Madison who sang on two of their albums, and for a brief period in 1985 Edman fronted Vinnie Vincent Invasion between Robert Fleischmann and Mark Slaughter. Edman soon left the band to sing in former Europe guitarist John Norum's solo project, where he sang on the album Total Control (1987). Later, Edman sang for Yngwie Malmsteen and on the early demos with former Malmsteen bassist Marcel Jacob's band Talisman. Edman was replaced by an old friend of BC Strike, Tony Niva from the bands Vanessa and Traci Goes Crazy.  Record deal and debut album  After living in Los Angeles in 1988, where they hung out with among others Kee Marcello and Stevie Nicks and met with several record companies, eventually Swedish Erotica were signed to Virgin Records thanks to A&R; representative Donna Simmons, based on the strength of the band's demos with Edman singing. Towards the end of the year the band recorded demos in Tuff Studios with several different singers, including Mats Lev√©n. In early 1989 the band recorded a demo in Norway with producer Ole Evenrude. Lev√©n contributed background vocals, and was asked by Evenrude about why he was not the lead singer of the band. Lev√©n told me that he had declined the offer last year but was now actually interested in fronting the band. Swedish Erotica released their first single Downtown with Niva on vocals the same year. Cooperation with Niva did not work out, and soon he was replaced by Lev√©n. The debut album \\"Swedish Erotica\\" came out in 1989 with Lev√©n singing and former frontman Tony Niva featured on background vocals. Videos for the album's first two singles \\"R'n'R City\\" and \\"Young Wild & Free\\" were filmed and the videos played on MTV. Thanks to this the band got more attention than many other artists signed by Virgin Scandinavia. Second single, \\"Wild Young & Free,\\" reached high on the charts but the album was delayed when the distribution company, Elektra went bankrupt, so that all copies of the debut album stayed in a warehouse for a month. The album was not distributed to the stores when demand existed, which led to reduced sales and lack of success for the band. After numerous gigs in and around their hometown, among other the clubs Alexis and White Corner and Fr√∂lunda Culture House a UK tour followed, which included a gig at the Astoria in London for 700-800 people, even before the album was released in the UK. After touring for their debut album, the band returned to the studio in the spring of 1990 to record some demos for a second studio album. Virgin evaluated the material but found it lacking material similar to the first two singles, which were written by the album¬¥s producer Ole Evenrude. The third single from the album, Hollywood Dreams, was also written by an outside writer, British songwriter Jimmy Scott.  Member replacement and cover bands  About the same time Jamie Borger, who had played in the band's first version Swedish Beauty, and now was a member of the far more successful Treat, informed Lev√©n that his band was looking for a new singer. Lev√©n felt that Virgin did not anticipate a successful career for Swedish Erotica, and he also wanted to move to Treat's hometown of Stockholm, so he began to consider leaving the band. He discussed with a manager at the Virgin that he wanted to leave the band and was told that the label was more interested in him than the band and he was offered a solo project. But the singer decided to leave the label and join the established Swedish band Treat, where he sang on their self-titled album in 1992, while Swedish Eroticas second album remained unreleased. Bjarne was replaced by Jonas Olsson on drums while Lev√©n was replaced by former Slobobans Underg√•ng singer Anders Moller, who previously had replaced Goran Edman on vocals in Madison and also sang in a cover band Crazy Train. Later Jonas T√•ngstr√∂m was replaced on bass, first by Terry Barajas who later became the drummer in Abysmal Dawn and then by Ken Sandin, a former member of bands Alien and Da Vinci, and also the precursor to the band, Swedish Beauty. During this period, the same members played around Gothenburg in the cover band Double Trouble, covering songs by, among others Guns N' Roses, Poison, Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Magnus Uggla. 1993 Bjarne Johansson played as a guest musician in a new version of Shotgun Messiah with the stage name \\"BJ\\", and abandoned thus Swedish Erotica, and was replaced by Jamie Borger, recently Treat but also the very first drummer in Swedish Beauty, the same person who earlier had persuaded Lev√©n to leave the band in favor of Treat.  Second album and split  1995, with a new contract with a small company Empire Records, Swedish Erotica finally released a second album called Blindman's Justice, recorded in Bauhaus Studios in Gothenburg and mixed by Michael Ilbert. After the album was released frontman M√∂ller had great success with his other band, pop-rockers Black Ingvars, topping the Swedish album charts and touring successfully. This and the general musical climate dominated by grunge and alternative rock led to the Swedish Erotica finally disbanding in 1996.  Recent events - the third album  The former frontman Mats Lev√©n has participated in several projects and is one of the most established singers in the Swedish metal scene. Following his time in Treat, he was involved in AB/CD, a parody of AC/DC and released the album Cut the Crap! 1995. Later bands include Abstract Algebra, At Vance, Fatal Force, Therion and many others. 2012 Leven briefly fronted Candlemass after they got rid of former front man Robert Lowe. 2005, the German company MTM Music released a compilation by Swedish Erotica - Too Daze Gone. Morgan Jensen moved on to a successful career as a writer in film and television, Axx operated until early 2019 one of the most popular rock clubs in Sweden, Sticky Fingers in Gothenburg, while M√∂ller and Sandin remained musicians in various constellations over the years. Axx is also credited on one Mot√∂rhead album as one of the few outside writers ever to receive a songwriting credit together with the band on one song, \\"Civil War\\" on the \\"Overnight Sensation\\" album. This disc contains several recordings with Lev√©n that were meant for the second album. The recordings were made before Lev√©n left the band in favor of Treat. There are also old demos recorded at the beginning of the band's career, different sessions from before they were signed. Three of the songs are from the demo that gave them the recording contract with Virgin.

He is best known for helping to develop Miami Beach's nightlife and his humanitarian work with his foundation, Global Empowerment Mission. Early life Capponi was born in Belgium; he moved to Miami with his parents when he was six, and grew up on Key Biscayne. His parents divorced. He began working as a promoter for nightclubs when he was 15, organizing events and posting flyers, and while still in high school made $10,000 per month. Career alt=Ten Museum Park in Miami In the 1980s, he promoted roving parties that attracted the attendance of the rich locals and celebrities. The events were held at a different location in South Beach every weekend to escape the scrutiny of police and regulatory authorities. Capponi also worked as a developer alongside Gregg Covin. Together, they used the parties to promote real estate projects in the area to celebrities and wealthy investors. Capponi's contributions to South Beach's development continued into the 1990s. With Covin, Armin Mattli, and Chad Oppenheim, Capponi in 2004 became one of the co-developers of Ten Museum Park, a 50-story, 200-unit building in downtown. In 2010, he formed Capponi Construction Group. His firm was responsible for the renovation of Terra Veritatis, a 16-bedroom estate spanning 2.5 acres (1.0 ha) of Miami Beach completed in 2013. The Wall Street Journal called the $40 million project \\"the most expensive renovation in the Miami area.\\" Capponi and Gary Shear formed another company in 2013, Capponi Shear Construction, a general contracting firm. In 2014, Capponi joined the development team with Moses Bensusan of Costa Hollywood, an urban beachfront development, by architect Hamed Rodriguez. The 500,000-square-foot resort consists of 307 fully furnished apartments. Capponi with software engineer Gideon Kimbrell, co-founded InList, an app for nightlife and special event reservations. Humanitarian work alt=Capponi at his tent city in Belvil, P√©tion-Ville, Haiti, in March 2010 When Hurricane Charley hit Florida in August 2004, Capponi teamed up with the American Red Cross and organized relief efforts for the victims. He worked with local nightlife venues to raise money and provide support. The partnership continued in December 2004, with a fundraiser for the Thailand tsunami victims. In 2006, Capponi teamed up with Miami Rescue Mission to fortify and expand its annual Great Thanksgiving Day Banquet, which feeds over 2,500 homeless people in Miami. In 2012, Capponi announced the construction of a 78-bed men's shelter for Miami Rescue Mission. After the January 12, 2010 Haiti earthquake, Capponi organized a plane with a relief team consisting of Miami Beach firefighters and doctors. In December 2010, Capponi started a project to revitalize Jacmel, a historical town in Haiti. This initiative was to help stimulate a self-sustained tourism economy for Haiti. In 2011, he founded the non-profit organization Haiti Empowerment Mission. In 2016, the foundation changed its name to Global Empowerment Mission. Capponi has held events for various charities. In 2012, Donna Karan hosted Capponi's 40th birthday benefit at Capitale for the Haitian city of Jacmel. On October 5, 2016, the day after Hurricane Matthew hit Haiti, Capponi and the Global Empowerment Mission team were on the ground delivering aid and supplies. In response to Hurricane Maria in 2017, Capponi partnered with Bethenny Frankel, Will Smith and other celebrities to provide logistical aid in Puerto Rico to people affected by the hurricane. Global Empowerment Mission organized warehouse storage space, chartered flights, and transportation for food and material aid donated from elsewhere in the United States.  Personal life  By the 1990s, Capponi had developed an $800-per-day heroin habit. By 1995, he was homeless in New York City. At his father's suggestion, Capponi entered a methadone program in Belgium; he fell into a coma soon after starting, and had to undergo surgery to remove a benign brain tumour. He then went through a detox program in Canada, before returning to Miami Beach. In the 1990s, he was close friends with Chris Paciello, a former Cosa Nostra associate and South Beach nightclub owner, with whom he owned music production company C&P; Music. He credits Paciello with getting him off heroin by sending him to a detox center. On March 20, 2015, he was at the helm of his 25-foot Chris-Craft Corsair motorboat when he fainted, he reported; The boat slammed head-on into a seawall. The accident seriously injured Capponi and a female passenger. Capponi suffered a broken nose, broken ribs, and a broken collarbone; his passenger suffered serious head injuries, was in a coma for three weeks, and lost much of her short-term memory. The final report of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission on the accident stated that \\"neither victim was cited and that no alcohol or drugs were found in the couple's systems, aside from the medication given to them at the hospital. Capponi's insurer claimed that he had failed to advise them of being convicted on a DUI charge in 2003 and hence had benefited from a lower premium. The insurer's case that they were not liable for damages was dismissed.

During her time at Longchamp d'Harcourt was appointed abbess, and she remained at the abbey as a nun until her death. While serving as abbess, d'Harcourt wrote Life of Isabella, the biography of her friend, colleague, and eventual saint, Isabelle. The book is considered one of the \\"most valuable works of the early French writer.\\"  Life and family  Agnes d'Harcourt was the daughter of Jean I, baron of Harcourt and vicomte of St. Sauveur, and his wife Alix of Beaumont. d‚ÄôHarcourt‚Äôs family had strong connections to the French royal family: her father fought alongside Louis IX and Phillip III on crusades, and her brothers were all in royal service; her oldest brother, Jean II, was field marshal and admiral of France, and three other brothers served as advisers to Philip III and Philip IV. d'Harcourt was among the first group of women to enter Longchamp after it was established in June 1260. She served as Longchamp‚Äôs abbess for two terms, the first from 1266 to 1270 and the second from September 1281 to August 1287. It is possible that her first term was longer in duration, with scholar Sean Field theorizing that d'Harcourt‚Äôs first post lasted from 1264 to 1275. d'Harcourt‚Äôs date of death is disputable. A likely date falls in November 1291.  Career  d'Harcourt was the first Longchamp abbess to be re-elected to the position after an interim period of other leadership, indicating that the sisters in residence felt confident in her abilities. Through her role as abbess, d'Harcourt was responsible for buying land, negotiating for rents, and securing royal confirmation of the abbey‚Äôs purchases; records also indicate her involvement in filing a legal claim regarding the enforcement of a will. Analysis of the surviving records reveals a female leader who was ‚Äúmore literate, more adept at dealing with written documents, and more forceful in legal matters than her contemporaries.‚Äù  Writing  Two examples of d'Harcourt‚Äôs writing survive: Letter on Louis IX and Longchamp and The Life of Our Holy and Blessed Lady and Mother Madame Isabelle of France, known later as The Life of Isabelle of France (the production of which may make Agnes d'Harcourt ‚Äúthe first woman to have written an extant work of French prose‚Äù). The Life of Isabelle of France was produced at the request of Isabelle‚Äôs brother Charles of Anjou, king of Sicily, probably between 1280 and 1285, ten to fifteen years after Isabelle‚Äôs death. Field theorizes that Charles‚Äôs request was spurred by a desire to see his sister canonized; the request was made during the same period in which Louis IX (Charles and Isabelle‚Äôs brother) was being considered for sainthood. The Life of Isabelle of France is one of only three 13th century biographies written by women about women; as such, it provides insight into how holy women viewed their own work and the work of their sisters, without the use of a male intermediate or scribe. Unlike many works produced about 13th century holy women by male clergymen, d'Harcourt‚Äôs biography does not stress Isabelle‚Äôs physical experiences of a union with Christ, nor does it imply that Isabelle experienced ‚Äúmystical contact with the divine.‚Äù Instead, d'Harcourt highlighted Isabelle‚Äôs public work: ‚Äúcharity and care for the poor and unfortunate, her humility toward others, her renunciation of fine clothes [and] her role as founder of the abbey and author of its rule.‚Äù The biography produces an image of Isabelle as a legitimate leader who interacted and cooperated with powerful men, including the leaders of other religious houses, university professionals, the king, and the Pope. In addition to being a biography and a work of prose, The Life of Isabelle of France also showcases d'Harcourt‚Äôs work as an early historian. As scholar Anne-Helene Allirot notes, d'Harcourt reported events that she either witnessed firsthand or for which she could obtain information directly from eyewitnesses; she was careful to cite her sources, and endeavored to record the observations of as many witnesses as possible. Her methods, according to Allirot, indicate ‚Äúa strong awareness of the historical importance of written evidence.‚Äù Legacy d'Harcourt is a featured figure on Judy Chicago's installation piece The Dinner Party, being represented as one of the 999 names on the Heritage Floor.

Promotional singles  Both of the promotional singles in which were released before the album's release, \\"Hey Jasmin\\" was released on June 6, 2012 with an accompanying music video and \\"Let it Roll\\" was released digitally on June 19, 2012. Reception  Commercial performance  The album debuted at number 14 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 31,000 copies in its first week. To date, the album has sold 311,000 copies in the United States.  Critical response  Upon its release, Wild Ones received mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns an average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 54, based on ten reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Although he perceived the album's creative scope to be limited, David Jeffries of Allmusic called Wild Ones \\"gimmicky, lightweight, and best taken in small chunks, but get a glitter-friendly crowd together and it gets the party started, succeeding at its one and only goal\\". He also observed the album's material to be largely \\"hot, infectious fluff\\", but felt that the album \\"would be dragged down by any tacked-on sense of purpose, and thinking of Flo Rida as equal parts thrill seeker and hitmaker is easy\\". However, Rolling Stones Jody Rosen felt the album's production to be too inconsistent, observing that the album's \\"inhumanly supersized... dance beats\\" were either \\"genius\\" or \\"insipid\\", also writing that Flo Rida \\"[is] content to surrender center-stage on his producers\\". Complex called the album cover art the sixth worst cover of 2012.6\\\\.

Background  Gunaratne, a journalist turned mass communication scholar, was born in the village of Pathegama [1] in Weligama, Sri Lanka [2]. After completing his high school education at Carey College and Ananda College, he gained admission to the University of Ceylon in 1958. His teachers included H. A. De S Gunasekara, A. D. V. de S. Indraratne, F. R. Jayasuriya, and A. J. Wilson. Soon after leaving the university in 1962, he joined the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd. (Lake House), where he served as a journalist for five years. He left Ceylon in 1966 on a one-year fellowship offered by the World Press Institute of Saint Paul, Minn. Gunaratne attended the University of Oregon, where he got his M.A. in journalism in 1968. The University of Minnesota awarded him a PhD in journalism and mass communication in 1972. Gunaratne taught journalism in four countries: Australia, China, Malaysia, and the United States, where he settled and became a U.S. citizen. Being an inveterate traveler, Gunaratne has devoted an entire volume of his autobiographical trilogy to his travels [3].  Scholarship  Gunaratne has blended Eastern philosophy [9, 10], modern physics, and systems approaches [5, 16, 17], including Immanuel Wallerstein's world-systems analysis [18, 22, 28, 29, 31], James Miller's living systems theory [5], Fritjof Capra's theory of living systems [5, 9], and Ilya Prigogine's dissipative structures theory [18] to introduce new theoretical frameworks that can enrich (mass) communication research [13, 15, 22, 24, 31]. Late in his academic life, around the turn of this century, Gunaratne turned away from reliance on West-centric communication studies and turned his attention on Eastern philosophies to derive communication concepts and theory [9, 10].  Re-emphasis on Eastern philosophies  Gunaratne's principal contribution to de-Westernizing communication studies was his path-breaking book, The Dao of the Press: A Humanocentric Theory (Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press, 2005) [9]. In this book, he attempted to merge Eastern and Western philosophical tenets to derive a humanocentric theory of the press to demonstrate the potential of an inclusive framework of diversity (the yin-yang bifurcations) within unity (the ineluctable Dao). He has argued that the classical Four Theories of the Press has fallen into shambles because it failed to follow the path of \\"horizontally integrative macro-historical analysis\\" [30]. Clifford Christians (2011) wrote that while physicist Capra (in his book The Tao of Physics) established parallels between quantum science and Eastern philosophies, Gunaratne (in The Dao of the Press) has opened up the way for a \\"humanocentric theory of journalism\\". Christians (2011: p. 732) said: Christians implicitly endorsed Gunaratne's choice of Daoism as a radically human philosophy that could meet the challenge of preventing \\"the totalizing closure of our humanity into technique\\". In a Q&A; interview that Eric Loo (2004) conducted, Gunaratne explained how the adoption of the Daoist wu wei (action through inaction) model could result in a healthier form of journalism that reflects a multiplicity of views: Gunaratne's contemporary writings, particularly the essay titled \\"Go East, young 'man' ...\\" [10], advocate the conceptualization of communication theory by placing the building blocks of Buddhist phenomenology on the Daoist yin-yang ontology. Responses to this essay by Rakow (2013)Rakow, L. F. (2013). Worldviews and mediatization: in search of a metatheory. Journal of Multicultural Discourses, 8 (3): 190‚Äì194. and by Waisboard (2013);Waisboard, W. (2013). A metatheory of mediatization and globalization? Journal of Multicultural Discourses, 8 (3): 182‚Äì189. clearly indicate that a substantial interest remains in the continuing debate over de-Westernizing communication studies. Gunaratne argues that Daoism and Buddhism converge remarkably well on agreeing that human suffering or discontent is primarily a consequence of desire (for wealth), attachment, feelings and doggedly held opinions.

Interrogating Habermas  Another of Gunaratne's key publications aimed at de-Westernizing communication studies was his 2005 \\"Public Sphere and Communicative Rationality: Interrogating Habermas's Eurocentrism\\" [7]. In it, Gunaratne makes the case for a revision of J√ºrgen Habermas's theory to remove its lingering traces of \\"universalism\\" that promote domination through globalization‚Äîa euphemism for Eurocentric hegemony as the world moved from theory to practice. From Gunaratne's point of view, Eastern philosophy had much to offer to enrich Habermas's notion of communicative rationality. For example, both Buddhist and Chinese philosophy recognized the validity claim of rightness (conventional truth) derived through social consensus. If Habermas were to concede this point, his theory would become more acceptable to non-Europe. This monograph has been cited by more than 20 scholars, including Dolber (2011);Dolber, B. (2011).

Wiesbaden: VS-Verlag f√ºr Sozialwissenschaften.  Other pitfalls of West-centrism  Gunaratne has advocated de-Westernizing science [4, 9, 11, 15, 31] because its primary emblem, the Cartesian‚ÄìNewtonian paradigm [25, 26], is based upon questionable Western epistemology, which (a) condones Newtonian reductionism‚Äîthe tendency to study parts without the context of the whole; (b) fails to capture the nonlinear interactions of relevant factors that engender particular outcomes; and (c) erroneously associates science with objectivity based on the Cartesian belief that the mind and body are independent. He agrees with Wallerstein that science is the smartest Trojan horse used by the West to perpetuate European universalism, when its attempt to do so through Orientalism [12] in the humanities failed. Gunaratne exhorts the Asian communication scholars to assume a leading role in transforming European universalism to universal universalism in the social sciences by delving into their axial Eastern philosophies [4,10], which the West downgraded as regressive to justify Western colonialism and imperialism. In a 2008 article he wrote for the inaugural issue of Communication, Culture & Critique [15], he pointed out the potential of two paradigms extracted from Eastern philosophy: the Buddhist paticca-samuppada (dependent co-arising) paradigm, and the Chinese Yijing (Book of Changes) paradigm. Theory and research based on these two paradigms entail greater complexity and realism because they enable the understanding of dynamic processes the outcomes of which cannot be predicted through covering laws as claimed by Newtonian science [25. 26]. The understanding of these processes, however, enables the actors involved to alter their actions on the expectation of counter-actions by their alter egos. In a 2007 article published in China Media Research [20], Gunaratne demonstrated how the Chinese yin-yang model [22] could be deployed to explicate global freedom of the press. This model presumes that everything has its complement/opposite (just as quantum physics asserts that every particle has an anti-particle). Therefore, libertarianism (in governance or in media freedom) must co-exist with authoritarianism in a continuum. The push and pull of these two forces determine global media freedom, as well as that of each nation-state. Gunaratne asserts that this continuum takes a spiral form because it recognizes the possibility of quantum jumps from libertarianism to authoritarianism or vice versa following coups or revolutions. It also recognizes governance and freedom as dynamic processes without the bias of Western ideology.  Path breaking and leading works  Gunaratne's critique on West-centrism has paved the way for many Indian scholars to look afresh at the Indian media curriculum currently followed in Indian universities. Gunaratne thought that the Indian media education had just been content with the teaching and aping the Western models of communication and media theories. The paper of Murthy (2012) published in Asia Pacific Media Educator has extensively quoted the works of Gunaratne, many of which have been cited below under . The way Gunaratne related Buddhist philosophy to the possible practices in print journalism was path breaking. Though some scholars from India had found similar convergence between Indian ethos and Gandhian journalism earlier, those works did not go beyond superficial theorization but Gunaratne has first demonstrated how to scientifically correlate the Buddhist philosophical principles with the media principles of practice such as objective reporting. The comparison of Buddhist philosophical principles with Daoist philosophy, as done by Gunaratne, offered new insights to authors (like Murthy who engaged in comparing them with other tales in trying to hammer out a new model of communication akin to Vladimir Proppian model) to look at several other works of Buddhism such as the Tripitaka in which a number of tales offer excellent vistas in comparison with Western communication models. Murthy stated that Gunaratne's work will go a long way in so far discovering the richest wealth of communication principles, practices, theories and models that lie in store in the Asian philosophical repertoire, especially Indian.

Best known for his 1893 poster of the chanteuse Eug√©nie Buffet, he was also a popular cover artist for the Parisian humor magazine Le Rire and a frequent contributor of cartoons and illustrations to it and other magazines. He illustrated books by a number of prominent authors of the time and wrote at least two books of his own. M√©tivet was \\"a master in caricature, humorous illustration and lithographic techniques\\" who became \\"one of the most prominent illustrators of the 19th century.\\"lambiek.net Biography M√©tivet was born in Paris in 1863. He studied classical art before turning to popular art forms. While still in his twenties, M√©tivet illustrated, with Carlos Schwabe, an 1890 edition of √âmile Zola‚Äôs novel Le R√™ve (which had first appeared two years earlier).Emery, Elizabeth Nicole, Romancing the Cathedral: Gothic Architecture in Fin-de-Si√®cle French Culture (SUNY Press, 2001) M√©tivet's 1893 poster portraying Eug√©nie Buffet and promoting her appearances at Charles Verneau's nightclub Les Ambassadeurs was the first of two he would do for her. It was immediately recognized as extraordinary, and a contemporary critic noted that \\"M√©tivet‚Äôs talent is seen at its best in the Eug√©nie Buffet advertisements\\" which he deemed \\"worthy [of] a place amongst the best posters which have come from the hands of contemporary French artists.‚ÄùHiatt, Charles, Picture Posters: A Short History of the Illustrated Placard, with Many Reproductions of the Most Artistic Examples in All Countries (1895) Poster for performances by Eug√©nie Buffet M√©tivet‚Äôs first cover for the humor weekly Le Rire appeared on the magazine‚Äôs fifth issue, December 8, 1894. Entitled ‚ÄúSalon du Cycle,‚Äù the image humorously celebrated the popularity of the bicycle, which was at the time a new force in daily life. M√©tivet became a frequent contributor, and his many appearances in the magazine allowed his satirical side to emerge. For example, a February 1896 cartoon sequence entitled Rayons indiscrets (\\"Indiscreet Rays\\") consisted of comic silhouettes that played on the concept of the x-ray (a new technology) to audacious effect. As one art historian has noted, \\"M√©tivet here harnessed an absolutely new way of seeing ‚Äì notably one linked to the medical understanding of the body ‚Äì to the predilection for fantasy and voyeurism that seems to have been current in the contemporary visual imagination.‚ÄùThomson, Richard, The Troubled Republic: Visual Culture and Social Debate in France, 1889-1900 (Yale University Press, 2004), pages 45-46. In July 1896 the Century Co. ran a contest in Paris for a poster design depicting Napoleon. Of twenty-two submissions from leading poster artists, M√©tivet's design was unanimously selected as the first-place winner.The Publisher‚Äôs Weekly, January 11, 1896 Famously, one of the other contestants, whose work M√©tivet won out over, was Toulouse-Lautrec. M√©tivet's Napoleon poster, however, has had its share of detractors, including one reviewer who disliked its reliance on symbols and declared: ‚ÄúThe general public may approve of the design, but there is hardly a doubt that the artistic verdict will be ‚Äòtoo much detail and mystery.‚Äô Moreover, a poster which needs to be explained fails of its chief purpose.\\"American Bookmaker, January 1896 \\"At the Sculpture Exhibition\\" Share of the Soc.

Tanzanian coffee production averages between 30-40,000 metric tons annually of which approximately 70% is Arabica and 30% is Robusta. The nine main growing regions of Arabica are in: #Iringa #Kigoma #Matengo Highlands #Mbeya #Mbinga #Morogoro #Ngara #North Kilimanjaro #Usambara Mountains The main growing region of Robusta is the Bukoba area of the Kagera Region. Two new species were found recently in Tanzania's Eastern Arc Mountains, Coffea bridsoniae and C. kihansiensis. Harvest time is traditionally October to February. Ninety percent of the nation's coffee farms are smallholder, with the remainder being plantations. The industry estimates are approximately 270,000 personnel involved in the coffee industry. Before 1990, the State coffee board and the cooperative unions were responsible for marketing coffee. Reforms in 1990 and in 1994/95 affected export pricing. Coffee wilt disease appeared in Tanzania in 1997, spreading rapidly and causing serious losses.  History  300px 300px  Early history  Coffee was introduced into the Tanzanian region from modern day Ethiopia in the 16th century. Coffee was not really brewed in the region but was used as a stimulant. Through oral sources in the region the Haya tribe located in northwest Tanzania in modern-day Kagera region was the only recorded tribe that used the beans. The tribe boiled the Robusta beans and steamed them with various herbs and chewed on the mixture as a stimulant. The tribe also used the coffee beans as a form of currency and the growing and cultivating of the beans were highly controlled by tribal leaders.  Coffee During Colonization  The German colonization of the region in the late 19th century changed the value of the crop in the region. The Germans introduced various laws that reduced the control of tribal leaders over the cultivation of the crop and the coffee seeds were made widely available. The Haya tribe was forced to grow different food crops such as bananas and pineapples and were pressured to grow the new Arabica variant introduced by the Germans. In other regions of the country the Germans introduced the bean in the North of the region near Kilimanjaro and Tanga. Due to the abolishing of slavery tribal chiefs that relied on the trade for income such as the Chagga tribe, entirely switched to cultivating the Coffee beans. After World War I when the British took over Tanganyika they further accelerated the campaign to grow coffee in the region and introduced various land reform laws. The British also continued to receive resistance from the Haya people and coffee production in the north-west region remained stagnant. However, the Chagga tribe who had no history of cultivating the crop continued to produce the crop and in 1925 exported 6000 tonnes worth $1.2 million. With the expansion of the railway into the country the British expanded their network of coffee farmers. In 1925 the Kilimanjaro Native Planters‚Äô Association (KNPA) was formed and it was the first of many coffee cooperatives formed in the country, formed to help farmers obtain a better price.  Post-Independence Production  After independence the socialist government of Tanzania saw a lot of promise in the crop and aspired to double the crop production. Various schemes and loans were given to coffee farms to increase production. Furthermore, large governmental estates were created in the southern part of the country namely in Mbozi and Mbinga regions. The government expanded the idea of farmers cooperatives into areas that had no prior cooperative experience or need. Most of the cooperatives failed and the mass movement of the population due to Ujamaa in the early 1970s hampered production. Before, 1976 all coffee trades were handled by two cooperative owned coffee processing factories one in Moshi (arabica) and the other in Bukoba (robusta) and then it was sold at the Moshi auction. in 1977 all coffee cooperative unions were dissolved and the government mandated the Coffee Authority of Tanzania. The coffee production in the country suffered drastically due to major governmental interventions and high cost of growing. Reform in the early 1990s which privatized the industry drastically increased the efficiency of the system. The Tanzanian Coffee Board was reinstated to issue permits and licenses and coffee growing and selling was made entirely independent. Moreover, they are responsible for grading beans and running the Moshi Coffee Auction. Grading and Sale  Grading  250px Due to the country's colonial past, Tanzania opted for British nomenclature of grading Coffee, which is done according to shape, size and density of the beans. These eleven grades include; # AA # A # B # PB # C # E # F # AF # TT # UG # TEX  Market  There are three ways a farmer can sell his product. The Internal market where the produce is sold at a price decided by the farmer directly to private coffee buyers, village groups or coffee cooperatives. This practice is the most common between small farmers due to the low yields per farmer. Once the private coffee buyers and cooperatives have received a significant amount of produce they can either sell their goods at the Moshi Coffee Auction or export the product directly. Most top grade coffee growers are allowed to bypass the auction and are able to sell their coffee directly to the foreign roasters. This policy was created by the Coffee Board of Tanzania to allow farmers and local companies to build a long term relationship with international buyers. = Moshi Coffee Exchange = The Moshi Coffee Exchange is in Moshi, Kilimanjaro Region and holds a weekly auction for a 9-month season. Auctions are conducted weekly on Thursdays and all local exporters that do not have a license to bypass the exchange have to export through the auction. The auction is attended by licensed exporters and there are no limits placed on how much a single exporter can purchase. Below is a sample of average prices of coffee (per 50 kg bag) at the auction held on 15 January 2015 Mild Coffee #AA - $192.01 #A - $185.19 #AB - $194.45 #B - $183.67 #PB - $186.99 #C - $186.00 Hard Coffee #Robusta Organic - $98.00 #Robusta Screen 18 - $104.20 #Robusta Superior - $95.00 #Robusta FAQ - $83.60 Unwashed Arabica #Arabica FAQ - $172.94 Production Arabica coffee output by region in Tanzania Total coffee output by bean type in Tanzania The Tanzanian economy is heavily based on agriculture and it provides 24% of the national gross domestic product. In 2014 3.3% of Tanzania's export worth $186 million was coffee. More than 90% of the country's output originates from small farmers rather than estates and provides employment to 400,00 families and affect more than 2.4 million citizens directly. Coffee being the second highest valued agriculture export after tobacco. Major purchasers of Tanzanian coffee is Japan (22%), Italy (19%) and the United States (12%). Germany used to be the largest purchaser of Tanzanian coffee however with increased marketing and better quality control, Japan and the United States have begun to buy the lion share of the exports. The Tanzanian coffee board has met many challenges over the years and works continuously on making a better brand name for the Tanzanian coffee. Most of the country's export is used to blend in with other brands causing it to lose value on the international market. However, in Japan, Tanzanian coffee has managed to maintain a brand called \\"Kilimanjaro coffee\\". In 1991 the All Japan Fair Trade Council decided that all Tanzanian coffee can retain the label \\"Kilimanjaro coffee\\" regardless of what region in Tanzania it was produced. Furthermore, any coffee blend that contains 30% or more Tanzanian beans can also use the label. This major step forward in the Japanese market has caused for an appreciation in value for Tanzanian coffee in the country and today Japan is the highest importer of the bean. Local consumption of coffee is nearly not as large as the export volume. Due to high amounts of poverty in the country coffee is more expensive than tea and the populace consumes more tea. However, in the recent year local coffee consumption is increasing and has gone from 2% of production in 2003 to 7% in 2014.  Tanzania Coffee Research Institute  The Tanzania Coffee Research Institute was founded in 2000 as a non-profit government company and began operations in September 2001. The institute is primarily government owned and other members of the coffee community have a stake in the company. The company is a non profit and is entirely reliant on government funding, donors and the sale of farming materials and tools. Due to the declining output of coffee in Tanzania since the 1990s the institute is tasked to rejuvenate the coffee industry in the country and help increase revenue from coffee exports. The institute provides a service to the thousands of farmers in the industry with relevant technological advances and educating farmers on better farming practices in keeping with continuous profession development and current coffee farming industry best practises.

It is variously known as the slender-armed starfish, the gray sea star, or the lined sea star. It is found in the western Atlantic Ocean. Description Luidia clathrata is a large, flattish starfish, sometimes growing to a diameter of . It has a relatively small disc and five slender arms, which are two or three times the diameter of the disc. The upper surface of the disc and arms is clad in longitudinal rows of calcified plates called ossicles, and in paxillae, pillar-like spines with flattened summits covered with minute spinules. No plates are found along the margins of the arms, these being replaced by paxillae, but on the underside, the marginal plates are large and themselves covered with paxillae. The tube feet, found in longitudinal rows on the underside, do not have suckers, but have two swollen regions. A mouth is in the centre of the underside, with an oesophagus and cardiac stomach which can be everted. The gonads are underneath the sides of each arm.Family Luidiidae Marine Species Identification Portal. Retrieved 2011-08-29. Its colour is usually grey or light brown, but can be tinged with pink. The central row of plates on the upper side of the arms is usually dark grey or black. The underside of the starfish is a paler colour.Luidia clathrata Gray sea star Smithsonian Marine Station at Fort Pierce. Retrieved 2012-01-30. Distribution and habitat L. clathrata is found around the coastlines of the western Atlantic Ocean, from Virginia south to Brazil, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. It is usually on sandy or muddy sea beds down to a depth around , although it is occasionally found in deeper waters down to . Biology and ecology When L. clathrata loses part or all of an arm through predation, it can regenerate the limb. The damaged area is sealed off, and a new small arm-tip appears within a week. Subsequent development is at the rate of about a month, although this slows down when regeneration is nearly complete. A study on the regenerative capacity of L. clathrata found that increased ocean acidification, as is likely to happen under global warming, had no significant effect on the starfish's ability to regenerate its limbs. L. clathrata is both a predator and a forager. It selectively feeds on the \\"coot clam\\", Mulinia lateralis, when it is abundant, using chemoreceptors to help it find its prey. The coot clam is the preferred food of L. clathrata in Tampa Bay in Florida. At other times, it feeds by ingesting sediment and straining the material through spines around its mouth, extracting food particles in the process. Its diet includes both gastropod and bivalve molluscs, foraminiferans, nematodes, ostracods, small crustaceans, and detritus. It is photosensitive and mostly spends the daylight hours buried in the sediment. While buried, it sometimes everts its stomach to ingest detritus. L. clathrata spawns annually. The larvae pass through a planktonic bipinnaria stage, which lasts about a month before settling on the seabed, undergoing metamorphosis, and becoming juvenile starfish.

It originally aired on Showtime on October 2, 2011. The episode focuses on the return home of Marine Sergeant Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis), rescued after eight years as a prisoner-of-war in Afghanistan. While Brody is celebrated as a hero, CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) believes Brody to actually be acting as a sleeper agent for al-Qaeda. The pilot was universally acclaimed by critics and was the highest-rated drama premiere on Showtime since 2003.  Plot  In flashback, Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) is shown in Iraq, where she is working as a CIA case officer. She bribes her way into a prison, where one of her informants is being held - a bomb maker who is soon to be executed. As Carrie is spotted and dragged away by guards, the informant whispers something into her ear. Back in present day, Carrie arrives late to a meeting at the CIA Counterterrorism Center, where she was reassigned following the Iraqi prison incident. Director of Counterterrorism David Estes (David Harewood) announces that Marine Sergeant Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis), missing and presumed dead for eight years, has been rescued during a raid on an al-Qaeda compound. Carrie later confides in her co-worker and mentor, Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin), that what she was told by her informant in Iraq was that \\"An American prisoner of war has been turned.\\" She concludes that the POW in question must be Brody. Saul flatly rejects the possibility of the CIA conducting any investigation into Brody, who is now a beloved war hero. Jessica Brody (Morena Baccarin), Nicholas' wife, is shown having sex with Mike Faber (Diego Klattenhoff). Mike is later revealed to be Nick's best friend when he was captured, and a fellow Marine. Jessica is shocked to receive a phone call from Brody himself announcing his return, and she heads to the airport with their children, 16-year-old Dana (Morgan Saylor) and 12-year-old Chris (Jackson Pace), to greet him. While Brody is on his way home, Carrie is preparing to conduct her own unauthorized (and illegal) surveillance operation. She enlists her friend Virgil, an independent contractor, to install hidden cameras and microphones throughout Brody's house, which Carrie can monitor from home. They successfully complete the installation before Brody gets home. Carrie begins watching Brody's every move. The next day, Brody is the subject of a CIA debriefing, where Carrie, David, and various other CIA personnel are present. Brody is questioned by everyone regarding his experiences as an al-Qaeda prisoner. Carrie asks Brody if he ever had any contact with Abu Nazir, the leader of al-Qaeda. He says no, but he is lying, as a memory of Brody's is shown of himself with Abu Nazir. Carrie is skeptical and asks again repeatedly before David puts a stop to it. Later on, Brody goes to meet someone in the park. Believing that he may be meeting an al-Qaeda contact, Carrie, Virgil, and Max (Virgil's brother) follow him. But instead he meets up with Helen Walker (Afton Williamson), the wife of Tom Walker, a Marine who was captured together with Brody. Walker has also been missing for eight years, and Brody tells Helen that her husband was beaten to death while in captivity. Helen asks Brody if he was present while Tom was killed, and he says no, but again he is shown to be lying as Brody's memory of the beating is shown while he is clearly in the room. Carrie goes back home, where she meets a furious Saul already in her house. He has discovered her illegal surveillance setup and tells Carrie she will be reporting to the Inspector General and to \\"get a lawyer, you're going to need one\\". Carrie, in desperation, makes a pass at Saul, who leaves in disgust. Carrie is despondent and seemingly on the verge of a breakdown, but she eventually gets herself together enough to go to a bar, looking for a one-night stand. While chatting up a man at the bar, she studies musicians playing live at the bar, along with news footage on the TV of Brody's return, and suddenly has a revelation. She rushes over to Saul's house and shows him various news clips of Brody that day. She notes that every time Brody was on camera, he was tapping out a distinct sequence with his fingers. Carrie suggests that it looks like a coded message, possibly intended for a handler or sleeper cell. Saul agrees that it is something that needs to be investigated further. In the final scene, Brody is jogging through Washington, D.C. As he jogs, we see more of his memories of the Tom Walker beating. This time it is clear that, under command from Abu Nazir, it was actually Brody himself who beat Walker to death. Brody pauses from his jog to gaze at the Capitol building.  Production  The episode was co-written by executive producers Alex Gansa, Gideon Raff, and Howard Gordon, while executive producer Michael Cuesta directed.  Reception   Ratings  The original broadcast of the pilot episode on October 2, 2011 at 10:00 pm received 1.08 million viewers, becoming Showtime's highest-rated drama premiere in eight years (since Dead Like Me which also starred Patinkin, with 1.11 million in 2003). The episode received a total of 2.78 million viewers with additional broadcasts, on demand, and online viewings.  Reviews  The pilot episode received universal acclaim, scoring a Metacritic rating of 91/100 from 28 reviews, with all 28 critics giving positive reviews. Hank Stuever of The Washington Post gave the pilot episode an A-, saying \\"What makes Homeland rise above other post-9/11 dramas is Danes' stellar performance as Carrie‚Äîeasily this season's strongest female character\\" and that \\"The latter half of the first episode is exhilarating. I'm hooked.\\" Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe said it was his favorite drama pilot of the season, giving it an A. Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker gave it an A-, stating \\"It's the fall season's most intriguing, tense puzzler.\\" IGN TV gave it a positive review, saying that it was an \\"ace thriller\\" that also managed to have something to say about the War on Terror.  Awards and nominations  Michael Cuesta received a nomination for the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing ‚Äì Drama Series, losing to Patty Jenkins for the pilot of The Killing. The episode received Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series and Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series nominations at the 2012 Primetime Emmy Awards; Alex Gansa, Howard Gordon, and Gideon Raff won for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series.\\"Primetime Emmy Awards nominations for 2012 ‚Äì Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series\\".

With a maximum perceived intensity of X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale, at least 400 deaths were caused in Mexico and neighboring Guatemala. It was the first of a series of seismic events that affected parts of western Mexico during the month of June 1932, all reaching magnitude 7 or greater. The Mexican subduction zone, the Middle America Trench, is seismically active and has generated both destructive and non-destructive tsunamis. Each earthquake in the series caused significant damage, injuries, and deaths, and in each case tsunamis of various heights were generated, with the June 22 catastrophic tsunami in Cuyutl√°n and San Blas being described as one of the most destructive events in the region based on all available historical records. Tectonic setting This part of Mexico lies on a complex convergent boundary where the Rivera Plate and the Cocos Plate are being subducted beneath the North American Plate. The transform boundary between the Rivera and Cocos Plates is poorly defined. This earthquake is thought to have ruptured the south-easternmost segment of the interface involving the Rivera Plate, although it may also have affected the north-westernmost part of the Cocos- North American Plate interface. The complex subduction zone off the coast of Colima and Jalisco experiences large recurring earthquakes. Prior events occurred in 1806, 1818, and 1900, and a recurrence period of 77 years was proposed for the region, but because of difficulty in positively identifying the rupture zones, this time frame was not precisely established. In 2003, near the same location, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 claimed 29 lives. Earthquake The mainshock was preceded by a series of small foreshocks. The rupture is thought to have initiated near Manzanillo, propagating to the northwest, although early reports from seismologists placed the epicenter farther southeast near the border of Oaxaca and Guerrero. The length of the rupture is estimated to be about 220 km. Seismometers located in New York, London, and Pasadena, California all measured the earthquake. Plate boundaries in the Pacific, offshore western Mexico Carlos Valdez, director of the National Seismology Center at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, called the earthquake the most powerful quake in modern Mexican history. Sequence The initial earthquake of June 3 off of the coast of Colima and Jalisco caused extensive damage along western Mexico, with much of the deaths and injuries concentrated in the area of Guadalajara. Early reporting from the Los Angeles Times noted that there were 300 deaths or injuries in that area alone. Fifteen days after the first shock, June 18 at 4:15 am, there was a magnitude 7.7 event with an estimated rupture length of and a duration of 22 seconds. Similar patterns of damage occurred as in the first quake. This time the human loss was centered around the city of Colima with 3 deaths and twelve injured, with heavy damage reported in Manzanillo. The low number of casualties may have been a result of many residents still sleeping outdoors since the previous quake. The Governor of Colima's home partially collapsed, though he escaped injury. The tsunami created from this event, reported to be in height, was the smallest generated from the three June earthquakes. The final and smallest event occurred on June 22 with a magnitude 7 earthquake. A few minutes after the quake, there was a tsunami which resulted in the almost total destruction of the hotels and village homes in the city of Cuyutl√°n. The wave(s) were reported to be up to in height. Up to 100 people were reported killed as the wave swept into the center of that small coastal village. The port city of Manzanillo also saw heavy damage again, but early reports via messenger did not indicate any deaths in that area. Both wired telegraph and radio communications were interrupted there. As Governor Saucedo gathered reports of inadequate care for those affected in Cuyutl√°n following the destructive wave, he appealed to the Red Cross to fill gaps where federal and state aid were proving ineffective. In the capital of Colima, where the residents were already recovering in their own neighborhoods, 2000 refugees were taken in from the wave swept coast. Tsunami The earthquake triggered a tsunami that had a maximum run-up height of 3 m at Bahia San Pedrito in Manzanillo. The tsunami was also recorded at Apia, San Diego, Hilo and Honolulu. Little damage was recorded from the tsunami other than the washing out of part of the railway line between Cuyutl√°n and Manzanillo and partial flooding of the port town of San Blas, Nayarit, but no deaths occurred there. Damage The earthquake caused significant damage and deaths in Colima, Ayotl√°n, Manzanillo, Cihuatl√°n, Zamora and Acatl√°n de Ju√°rez. In Colima almost 3,000 houses were damaged. The sixteenth century Guadalajara Cathedral also sustained damage in the quake. Farther south in Mexico city several buildings toppled over and numerous cracks formed on the streets. Following the quake there were no communications coming in from the city of Oaxaca. That city had suffered heavy damage the prior year in a magnitude 7.8 event, and there was initial concern that there had been a repeat event with a high death toll centered in that area.

It posits \\"three distinct but often related components of wellbeing: frequent positive affect, infrequent negative affect, and cognitive evaluations such as life satisfaction.\\"Tov & Diener (2013), Subjective Well-Being. Research Collection School of Social Sciences. Paper 1395. http://ink.library.sju.edu.sg/soss_research/1395https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49658154_A_Review_of_the_Tripartite_Structure_of_Subjective_Well- Being_Implications_for_Conceptualization_Operationalization_Analysis_and_Synthesis SWB therefore encompasses moods and emotions as well as evaluations of one's satisfaction with general and specific areas of one's life. Concepts encompassed by SWB include happiness. Although SWB tends to be stable over time and is strongly related to personality traits, the emotional component of SWB can be impacted by situations; for example, the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, lowered emotional well-being by 74%. There is evidence that health and SWB may mutually influence each other, as good health tends to be associated with greater happiness, and a number of studies have found that positive emotions and optimism can have a beneficial influence on health. Construction of SWB Diener argued that the various components of SWB represent distinct constructs that need to be understood separately, even though they are closely related. Hence, SWB may be considered \\"a general area of scientific interest rather than a single specific construct\\". Due to the specific focus on the subjective aspects of well-being, definitions of SWB typically exclude objective conditions such as material conditions or health, although these can influence ratings of SWB. Definitions of SWB therefore focus on how a person evaluates his/her own life, including emotional experiences of pleasure versus pain in response to specific events and cognitive evaluations of what a person considers a good life. Components of SWB relating to affect include positive affect (experiencing pleasant emotions and moods) and low negative affect (experiencing unpleasant, distressing emotions and moods), as well as \\"overall affect\\" or \\"hedonic balance\\", defined as the overall equilibrium between positive and negative affect, and usually measured as the difference between the two. High positive affect and low negative affect are often highly correlated, but not always. Components of SWB There are two components of SWB. One is Affective Balance and the other is Life Satisfaction. An individual's scores on the two measures are summed to produce a total SWB score. In some cases, these scores are kept separate. * Affective balance Affective balance refers to the emotions, moods, and feelings a person has. These can be all positive, all negative, or a combination of both positive and negative. Some research shows also that feelings of reward are separate from positive and negative affect. *Life satisfaction Life satisfaction (global judgments of one's life Daniel Kahneman has said that ‚ÄúLife satisfaction is connected to a large degree to social yardsticks‚Äìachieving goals, meeting expectations.‚Äù https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium.MAGAZINE-why-nobel-prize-winner- daniel-kahneman-gave-up-on-happiness-1.6528513 https://qz.com/1503207/a-nobel- prize-winning-psychologist-defines-happiness-versus-satisfaction/) and satisfaction with specific life domains (e.g. work satisfaction) are considered cognitive components of SWB. The term \\"happiness\\" is also commonly used in regards to SWB and has been defined variously as \\"satisfaction of desires and goals\\" (therefore related to life satisfaction), as a \\"preponderance of positive over negative affect\\" (therefore related to emotional components of SWB), as \\"contentment\\", and as a \\"consistent, optimistic mood state\\" and may imply an affective evaluation of one's life as a whole. Life satisfaction can also be known as the \\"stable\\" component in one's life. Affective concepts of SWB can be considered in terms of momentary emotional states as well as in terms of longer-term moods and tendencies (i.e. how much positive and/or negative affect a person generally experiences over any given period of time). Life satisfaction and in some research happiness are typically considered over long durations, up to one's lifetime. \\"Quality of life\\" has also been studied as a conceptualization of SWB. Although its exact definition varies, it is usually measured as an aggregation of well- being across several life domains and may include both subjective and objective components. Measurement of SWB components Life satisfaction and Affect balance are generally measured separately and independently. * Life satisfaction is generally measured using a self-report method. A common measurement for life satisfaction is questionnaires. * Affective balance is also generally measured using a self-report method. An example of a measurement of affective balance is the PANAS (Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule). Sometimes a single SWB question attempts to capture an overall picture.See e.g. \\"The most basic way of measuring it involves asking individuals how they feel about their lives - known as subjective well being. A typical question is, \\"Taking all things together, how happy are you?\\" - with possible answers from 0 (extremely unhappy) to 10 (extremely happy).\\" Can Happiness be Measured?, http://www.actionforhappiness.org/why-happiness For example the World Happiness Report uses a Cantril ladder survey, in which respondents are asked to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10, and the worst possible life being a 0, and are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale. The issue with the such measurements of life satisfaction and affective balance is that they are self- reports. The problem with self-reports is that the participants may be lying or at least not telling the whole truth on the questionnaires. Participants may be lying or holding back from revealing certain things because they are either embarrassed or they may be filling in what they believe the researcher wants to see in the results. To gain more accurate results, other methods of measurement have been used to determine one‚Äôs SWB. Another way to corroborate or confirm that the self-report results are accurate is through informant reports. Informant reports are given to the participant‚Äôs closest friends and family and they are asked to fill out either a survey or a form asking about the participants mood, emotions, and overall lifestyle. The participant may write in the self-report that they are very happy, however that participant‚Äôs friends and family record that he/she is always depressed. This would obviously be a contradiction in results which would ultimately lead to inaccurate results. Another method of gaining a better understanding of the true results is through ESM, or the Experience Sampling Method. In this measure, participants are given a beeper/pager that will randomly ring throughout the day. Whenever the beeper/pager sounds, the participant will stop what he/she is doing and record the activity they are currently engaged in and their current mood and feelings. Tracking this over a period of a week or a month will give researchers a better understanding of the true emotions, moods, and feelings the participant is experiencing, and how these factors interact with other thoughts and behaviors. A third measurement to ensure validity is the Day Reconstruction Method. In this measure, participants fill out a diary of the previous days‚Äô activities. The participant is then asked to describe each activity and provide a report of how they were feeling, what mood they were experiencing, and any emotions that surfaced. Thus to ensure valid results, a researcher may tend to use self-reports along with another form of measurement mentioned above. Someone with a high level of life satisfaction and a positive affective balance is said to have a high level of SWB. Theories Theories of the causes of SWB tend to emphasise either top- down or bottom-up influences. Top-down perspective In the top-down view, global features of personality influence the way a person perceives events. Individuals may therefore have a global tendency to perceive life in a consistently positive or negative manner, depending on their stable personality traits. Top-down theories of SWB suggest that people have a genetic predisposition to be happy or unhappy and this predisposition determines their SWB \\"setpoint\\". Set Point theory implies that a person's baseline or equilibrium level of SWB is a consequence of hereditary characteristics and therefore, almost entirely predetermined at birth. Evidence for this genetic predisposition derives from behavior-genetic studies that have found that positive and negative affectivity each have high heritability (40% and 55% respectively in one study). Numerous twin studies confirm the notion of set point theory, however, they do not rule out the possibility that is it possible for individuals to experience long term changes in SWB. Diener et al. note that heritability studies are limited in that they describe long-term SWB in a sample of people in a modern western society but may not be applicable to more extreme environments that might influence SWB and do not provide absolute indicators of genetic effects. Additionally, heritability estimates are inconsistent across studies. Further evidence for a genetically influenced predisposition to SWB comes from findings that personality has a large influence on long-term SWB. This has led to the dynamic equilibrium model of SWB. This model proposes that personality provides a baseline for emotional responses. External events may move people away from the baseline, sometimes dramatically, but these movements tend to be of limited duration, with most people returning to their baseline eventually. Bottom-up perspective From a bottom-up perspective, happiness represents an accumulation of happy experiences. Bottom-up influences include external events, and broad situational and demographic factors, including health and marital status. Bottom-up approaches are based on the idea that there are universal basic human needs and that happiness results from their fulfilment. In support of this view, there is evidence that daily pleasurable events are associated with increased positive affect, and daily unpleasant events or hassles are associated with increased negative affect. However, research suggests that external events account for a much smaller proportion of the variance in self-reports of SWB than top-down factors, such as personality. A theory proposed to explain the limited impact of external events on SWB is hedonic adaptation. Based originally on the concept of a \\"hedonic treadmill\\", this theory proposes that positive or negative external events temporarily increase or decrease feelings of SWB, but as time passes people tend to become habituated to their circumstances and have a tendency to return to a personal SWB \\"setpoint\\" or baseline level. The hedonic treadmill theory originally proposed that most people return to a neutral level of SWB (i.e. neither happy nor unhappy) as they habituate to events. However, subsequent research has shown that for most people, the baseline level of SWB is at least mildly positive, as most people tend to report being at least somewhat happy in general and tend to experience positive mood when no adverse events are occurring. Additional refinements to this theory have shown that people do not adapt to all life events equally, as people tend to adapt rapidly to some events (e.g. imprisonment), slowly to others (e.g. the death of a loved one), and not at all to others (e.g. noise and sex). Factors affecting SWB Personality and genetics A number of studies have found that SWB constructs are strongly associated with a range of personality traits, including those in the five factor model. Findings from numerous personality studies show that genetics account for 20-48% of the variance in Five-Factor Model and the variance in subjective well-being is also heritable. Specifically, neuroticism predicts poorer subjective well-being whilst extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness to experience tend to predict higher subjective well-being. A meta-analysis found that neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness were significantly related to all facets of SWB examined (positive, negative, and overall affect; happiness; life satisfaction; and quality of life). Neuroticism was the strongest predictor of overall SWB and is the strongest predictor of negative affect. A large number of personality traits are related to SWB constructs, although intelligence has negligible relationships. Positive affect is most strongly predicted by extraversion, to a lesser extent agreeableness, and more weakly by openness to experience. Happiness was most strongly predicted by extraversion, and also strongly predicted by neuroticism, and to a lesser extent by the other three factors. Life satisfaction was significantly predicted by neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Quality of life was very strongly predicted by neuroticism, and also strongly predicted by extraversion and conscientiousness, and to a modest extent by agreeableness and openness to experience. One study found that subjective well-being was genetically indistinct from personality traits, especially those that reflected emotional stability (low Neuroticism), and social and physical activity (high Extraversion), and constraint (high Conscientiousness). DeNeve (1999) argued that there are three trends in the relationship between personality and SWB. Firstly, SWB is closely tied to traits associated with emotional tendencies (emotional stability, positive affectivity, and tension). Secondly, relationship enhancing traits (e.g. trust, affiliation) are important for subjective well-being. Happy people tend to have strong relationships and be good at fostering them. Thirdly, the way people think about and explain events is important for subjective well-being. Appraising events in an optimistic fashion, having a sense of control, and making active coping efforts facilitates subjective well-being. Trust, a trait substantially related to SWB, as opposed to cynicism involves making positive rather than negative attributions about others. Making positive, optimistic attributions rather than negative pessimistic ones facilitates subjective well-being. The related trait of eudaimonia or psychological well-being, is also heritable. Evidence from one study supports 5 independent genetic mechanisms underlying the Ryff facets of psychological well-being, leading to a genetic construct of eudaimonia in terms of general self-control, and four subsidiary biological mechanisms enabling the psychological capabilities of purpose, agency, growth, and positive social relations.D. Archontaki, G. J. Lewis and T. C. Bates. (2012). Genetic influences on psychological well-being: A nationally representative twin study. Journal of Personality10.1111/j.1467-6494.2012.00787.x Social influences A person's level of subjective well-being is determined by many different factors and social influences prove to be a strong one. Results from the famous Framingham Heart Study indicate that friends three degrees of separation away (that is, friends of friends of friends) can affect a person's happiness. From abstract: \\"A friend who lives within a mile (about 1.6 km) and who becomes happy increases the probability that a person is happy by 25%.\\" Family Research has not demonstrated that there are significant differences in subjective well-being between childless couples and couples with children. A research study by Pollmann-Schult (2014) found that when holding finances and time costs are held constant, parents are happier and show increased life satisfication than non-parents . Wealth Research indicates that wealth is related to many positive outcomes in life. Such outcomes include: improved health and mental health, greater longevity, lower rates of infant mortality, experience fewer stressful life events, and less frequently the victims of violent crimesMayer, J. D. & Salovey, P. (1997). What is emotional intelligence? In P. Salovey & D. Sluyter (Eds). Emotional Development and Emotional Intelligence: Implications for Educators (pp. 3-31). New York: Basic Books. However, research suggests that wealth has a smaller impact on SWB than people generally think, even though higher incomes do correlate substantially with life satisfaction reports. The relative influence of wealth together with other material components on overall subjective well-being of a person is being studied through new researches. The Well-being Project at Human Science Lab investigates how material well-being and perceptual well-being works as relative determinants in conditioning our mind for positive emotions. In a study done by Aknin, Norton, & Dunn (2009), researchers asked participants from across the income spectrum to report their own happiness and to predict the happiness of others and themselves at different income levels. In study 1, predicted happiness ranged between 2.4-7.9 and actual happiness ranged between 5.2-7.7. In study 2, predicted happiness ranged between 15-80 and actual happiness ranged between 50-80. These findings show that people believe that money does more for happiness than it really does.Norton, M.I., Dunn, E.W., & *Aknin, L.B. (2009). From wealth to well-being: Spending money on others promotes happiness. Invited talk at the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Tampa, FL However, some research indicates that while socioeconomic measures of status do not correspond to greater happiness, measures of sociometric status (status compared to people encountered face-to- face on a daily basis) do correlate to increased subjective well-being, above and beyond the effects of extroversion and other factors. The Easterlin Paradox also suggests that there is no connection between a society's economic development and its average level of happiness. Through time, the Easterlin has looked at the relationship between happiness and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) across countries and within countries. There are three different phenomena to look at when examining the connection between money and Subjective well-being; rising GDP within a country, relative income within a country, and differences in GDP between countries.Easterlin, Richard A., 1973, Does Money Buy Happiness? The Public Interest, 30 (Winter), 3-10 More specifically, when making comparisons between countries, a principle called the Diminishing Marginal Utility of Income (DMUI) stands strong. Veenhoven (1991) said, \\"[W]e not only see a clear positive relationship [between happiness and GNP per capita], but also a curvilinear pattern; which suggest that wealth is subject to a law of diminishing happiness returns.\\" Meaning a $1,000 increase in real income, becomes progressively smaller the higher the initial level of income, having less of an impact on subjective well-being. Easterlin (1995) proved that the DMUI is true when comparing countries, but not when looking at rising gross domestic product within countries. Health There are substantial positive associations between health and SWB so that people who rate their general health as \\"good\\" or \\"excellent\\" tend to experience better SWB compared to those who rate their health as \\"fair\\" or \\"poor\\". A meta-analysis found that self-ratings of general health were more strongly related to SWB than physician ratings of health. The relationship between health and SWB may be bidirectional. There is evidence that good subjective well-being contributes to better health. A review of longitudinal studies found that measures of baseline subjective well-being constructs such as optimism and positive affect predicted longer-term health status and mortality. Conversely, a number of studies found that baseline depression predicted poorer longer-term health status and mortality. Baseline health may well have a causal influence on subjective well-being so causality is difficult to establish. A number of studies found that positive emotions and optimism had a beneficial impact on cardiovascular health and on immune functioning. Changes in mood are also known to be associated with changes in immune and cardiovascular response. There is evidence that interventions that are successful in improving subjective well-being can have beneficial effects on aspects of health. For example, meditation and relaxation training have been found to increase positive affect and to reduce blood pressure. The effect of specific types of subjective well-being is not entirely clear. For example, how durable the effects of mood and emotions on health are remains unclear. Whether some types of subjective well-being predict health independently of others is also unclear. Meditation has the power to increase happiness because it can improve self-confidence and reduces anxiety, which increases your well-being. Cultivating personal strengths and resources, like humour, social/animal company, and daily occupations, also appears to help people preserve acceptable levels of SWB despite the presence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Research suggests that probing a patient's happiness is one of the most important things a doctor can do to predict that patient's health and longevity. In health-conscious modern societies, most people overlook the emotions as a vital component of one's health, while over focusing on diet and exercise. According to Diener & Biswas-Diener, people who are happy become less sick than people who are unhappy. There are three types of health: morbidity, survival, and longevity. Evidence suggests that all three can be improved through happiness: # Morbidity, simply put, is whether or not someone develops a serious illness, such as the flu or cancer. In a 30-year longitudinal study, participants who were high in positive emotions were found to have lower rates of many health problems. Some of these illnesses/problems include lower death rates from heart disease, suicide, accidents, homicides, mental illnesses, drug dependency, and liver disease related to alcoholism. Additionally, results showed that depressed participants were more likely to have heart attacks and recurrences of heart attacks when compared to happy people. # Survival is the term used for what happens to a person after he/she has already developed or contracted a serious illness. Although happiness has been shown to increase health, with survival, this may not be the case. Survival may be the only area of health that evidence suggests happiness may actually be sometimes detrimental. It is unclear why exactly research results suggest this is the case, however Diener & Biswas-Diener offer an explanation. It is possible that happy people fail to report symptoms of the illness, which can ultimately lead to no treatment or inadequate treatment. Another possible reason may be that happy people tend to be optimistic, leading them to take their symptoms too lightly, seek treatment too late, and/or follow the doctor‚Äôs instructions half-heartedly. And lastly, Diener & Biswas-Diener suggest that people with serious illnesses may be more likely to choose to live out the rest of their days without painful or invasive treatments. # Longevity, the third area of health, is measured by an individual's age of death. Head researcher Deborah Danner of the University of Kentucky researched links between an individual's happiness and that individual's longevity. Danner recruited 180 Catholic nuns from a nearby convent as the participants of her study. She chose nuns because they live very similar lives. This eliminates many confounding variables that might be present in other samples, which can lead to inaccurate results. Such confounding variables could include drug use, alcohol abuse, diet, and sexual risk-taking. Since there are few differences among the nuns as far as the confounding variables, this sample offered the best option to match a controlled laboratory setting. Results showed that nuns who were considered happy or positive in their manner and language on average lived 10 years longer than the nuns who were considered unhappy or negative in their manner and language. A follow-up study by health researcher Sarah Pressman examined 96 famous psychologists to determine if similar results from the nun research would be seen as well. Pressman's results showed that the positive or happy psychologists lived, on average, 6 years longer. The psychologists who were considered negative or unhappy lived, on average, 5 years less. Physical characteristics A positive relationship has been found between the volume of gray matter in the right precuneus area of the brain, and the subject's subjective happiness score. A 6 week mindfulness based intervention was found to correlate with a significant gray matter increase within the precuneus. Leisure There are a number of domains that are thought to contribute to subjective well-being. In a study by Hribernik and Mussap (2010), leisure satisfaction was found to predict unique variance in life satisfaction, supporting its inclusion as a distinct life domain contributing to subjective well-being. Additionally, relationship status interacted with age group and gender on differences in leisure satisfaction. The relationship between leisure satisfaction and life satisfaction, however, was reduced when considering the impact of core affect (underlying mood state). This suggests that leisure satisfaction may primarily be influenced by an individual's subjective well-being level as represented by core affect. This has implications for possible limitations in the extent to which leisure satisfaction may be improved beyond pre-existing levels of well-being and mood in individuals. Cultural variations Although all cultures seem to value happiness, cultures vary in how they define happiness. There is also evidence that people in more individualistic cultures tend to rate themselves as higher in subjective well-being compared to people in more collectivistic cultures. In Western cultures, predictors of happiness include elements that support personal independence, a sense of personal agency, and self-expression. In Eastern cultures, predictors of happiness focus on an interdependent self that is inseparable from significant others. Compared to people in individualistic cultures, people in collectivistic cultures are more likely to base their judgments of life satisfaction on how significant others appraise their life than on the balance of inner emotions experienced as pleasant versus unpleasant. Pleasant emotional experiences have a stronger social component in East Asian cultures compared to Western ones. For example, people in Japan are more likely to associate happiness with interpersonally engaging emotions (such as friendly feelings), whereas people in the United States are more likely to associate happiness with interpersonally disengaging emotions (pride, for example). There are also cultural differences in motives and goals associated with happiness. For example, Asian Americans tend to experience greater happiness after achieving goals that are pleasing to or approved of by significant others compared to European Americans. There is also evidence that high self-esteem, a sense of personal control and a consistent sense of identity relate more strongly to SWB in Western cultures than they do in Eastern ones. However, this is not to say that these things are unimportant to SWB in Eastern cultures. Research has found that even within Eastern cultures, people with high self-esteem and a more consistent sense of identity are somewhat happier than those who are low in these characteristics. There is no evidence that low self-esteem and so on are actually beneficial to SWB in any known culture. A large body of research evidence has confirmed that people in individualistic societies report higher levels of happiness than people in collectivistic ones and that socioeconomic factors alone are insufficient to explain this difference. In addition to political and economic differences, individualistic versus collectivistic nations reliably differ in a variety of psychological characteristics that are related to SWB, such as emotion norms and attitudes to the expression of individual needs. Collectivistic cultures are based around the belief that the individual exists for the benefit of the larger social unit, whereas more individualistic cultures assume the opposite. Collectivistic cultures emphasise maintaining social order and harmony and therefore expect members to suppress their personal desires when necessary in order to promote collective interests. Such cultures therefore consider self- regulation more important than self-expression or than individual rights. Individualistic cultures by contrast emphasise the inalienable value of each person and expect individuals to become self-directive and self-sufficient. Although people in collectivistic cultures may gain happiness from the social approval they receive from suppressing self-interest, research seems to suggest that self-expression produces a greater happiness \\"payoff\\" compared to seeking approval outside oneself. Positive psychology Positive psychology is particularly concerned with the study of SWB. Positive psychology was founded by Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi (2000) who identified that psychology is not just the study of pathology, weakness, and damage; but it is also the study of strength and virtue. Researchers in positive psychology have pointed out that in almost every culture studied the pursuit of happiness is regarded as one of the most valued goals in life. Understanding individual differences in SWB is of key interest in positive psychology, particularly the issue of why some people are happier than others. Some people continue to be happy in the face of adversity whereas others are chronically unhappy at the best of times. Positive psychology has investigated how people might improve their level of SWB and maintain these improvements over the longer term, rather than returning to baseline. Lyubomirsky (2001) argued that SWB is influenced by a combination of personality/genetics (studies have found that genetic influences usually account for 35-50% of the variance in happiness measures), external circumstances, and activities that affect SWB. She argued that changing one's external circumstances tends to have only a temporary effect on SWB, whereas engaging in activities (mental and/or physical) that enhance SWB can lead to more lasting improvements in SWB. According to Sonja Lyubomirsky the determinants of happiness are a combination of a person's genetic set-point, intentional activities and life circumstances Use in happiness economics SWB is often used in appraising the wellbeing of populations.

The cause It is called the Girls' War because it began with insults and curses being exchanged between young, high-ranking MƒÅori women, rivals for the affection of Captain William Darby Brind. Te Urumihia, the wife of Kiwikiwi of the Ngati Manu hap≈´ and the chief of KororƒÅreka, whose daughter was involved in the incident, cursed Brind's women (Pehi the daughter of Hongi Hika and Moewaka, the daughter of Rewa, a chief of the Ngai Tawake hap≈´, of Kerikeri). The exchange of insults and curses escalated into fighting between warriors, as the MƒÅori believed, as described by Carlton, ‚Äúthat every individual of a tribe must be supported, right or wrong, against offence‚Äù. The fighting In response to the curses, Ururoa (also known as Rewharewha), a chief of Whangaroa and brother-in-law of the late Hongi Hika, led warriors to raid the k≈´mara gardens of the Ngati Manu on 5 March 1830. Ururoa was supported by other chiefs from the various northern hap≈´ within the NgƒÅpuhi, including Tƒ´tore and Hone Heke. The warriors of Kiwikiwi, Te Morenga and P≈çmare II (originally called Whiria, also called Whetoi, nephew of P≈çmare I) defended KororƒÅreka. The Reverends Henry Williams, William Williams and other missionaries came over the bay from Paihia to attempt to mediate an end to the fighting. The mediation efforts appeared promising with the missionaries believing that the chiefs would accept that the plunder of the k≈´mara gardens at Korarareka would suffice as satisfaction of the earlier insults. However, during the morning of 6 March, a musket was fired by accident, wounding a woman in Ururoa's party. A battle commenced which Hengi, a chief of Whangaroa, attempted to stop; however he was shot and killed, his death having consequences in the months and years ahead. About 1,400 warriors were involved in the battle, with about 100 being killed. The consequences Eventually Henry Williams persuaded the warriors to stop the fighting. Reverend Samuel Marsden had arrived on a visit and over the following weeks he and Henry Williams attempted to negotiate a settlement in which KororƒÅreka would be ceded by P≈çmare II as compensation for Hengi's death, which was accepted by those engaged in the fighting. However, the duty of seeking revenge had passed to Mango and Kakaha, the sons of Hengi; they took the view that the death of their father should be acknowledged through a muru, or war expedition, against tribes to the south.\\"Traditional Maori Concepts, Muru\\" Ministry of Justice website It was within MƒÅori traditions to conduct a muru against tribes who had no involvement in the events that caused the death of an important chief. Mango and Kakaha did not commence the muru until January 1832. Tƒ´tore led the expedition. The Revd. Henry Willams accompanied the warriors, without necessarily believing that he could end the fighting, but with the intention of continuing to persuade the combatants as to Christian teaching of peace and goodwill. The journal of Henry Williams provides an extensive account of this expedition,Rogers, Lawrence M. (editor)(1961) - The Early Journals of Henry Williams 1826 to 1840. Christchurch : Pegasus Press. online available at New Zealand Electronic Text Centre (NZETC) which can be described as an incident in the so-called Musket Wars. The NgƒÅpuhi warriors were successful in fights on the Mercury Islands and Tauranga, with the muru continuing until late July 1832. The war did not end, as in February 1833 Tƒ´tore led a party of Te Rarawa, allies of the NgƒÅpuhi, from the North Cape back to Tauranga. Again Henry Williams accompanied the expedition in an attempt to bring it to a peaceful conclusion. While the Girls' War describes the fighting at KororƒÅreka in March 1830, its consequences played out over the following years with the expeditions conducted by NgƒÅpuhi against the Te Arawa at Tauranga. In 1837 P≈çmare II fought a three-month war with Tƒ´tore in the Bay of Islands. H≈çne Heke fought with Tƒ´tore against P≈çmare II. An underlying cause of the fighting was a dispute as to the boundary line of the KororƒÅreka block that had been surrendered as a consequence of the death of Hengi some seven years previously in the Girls‚Äô War.

Pilots Union, 296 F.3d 380 (5th Cir. 2002), is a court case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that although third officer aboard an oceangoing cargo vessel was a supervisor, the six- month period of limitations of ¬ß 10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act. still applies to Smith's suit against the union whether or not he was a supervisor. Facts On October 3, 1992, Appellant Stuart H. Smith, Jr., was serving as third officer aboard an oceangoing cargo vessel berthed in the Port of New Orleans. Smith was employed by Waterman Steamship Corporation (\\"Waterman\\"), the owner and operator of the vessel. On that day, the vessel was undocking when it collided with the dock. The collision caused damage to both the vessel and the dock. Holding Smith responsible, Waterman fired him the following day. At the time, Smith was a union member belonging to the International Organization of Masters, Mates & Pilots, a division of the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA). The union and Waterman were parties to a collective bargaining agreement (CBA), along with other employers. The agreement contained a grievance mechanism for solving labor- management disputes. Under the agreement, the union had the right to bring a grievance either on its own behalf or on behalf of a member. The agreement further authorized the union to pursue arbitration should the grievance procedure provide an unsatisfactory resolution. On October 7, 1992, Smith contacted the union and asked it to initiate grievance procedures with respect to his October 4 discharge. He claimed that the discharge was without cause. Smith and the union, each through counsel, exchanged correspondence regarding the grievance for over a year. During that time, the Coast Guard began an investigation of the October 3 collision. The union would not pursue Smith's grievance until it had received a complete report of the Coast Guard's investigation, which was not available until the Coast Guard completed its investigation in July 1999. Opinion of the Fifth Circuit The Fifth Circuit, in a decision by Senior Circuit Judge Reynaldo Guerra Garza, affirmed the district court's ruling. The conclusion of the Fifth Circuit was that the District court had found that as a statute of limitations, ¬ß 10(b) applies only to particular causes of action, not to particular types of people.Smith, 296 F.3d at 383. By its express terms, it applies to ¬ß 8 causes of action. It applies to ¬ß 301 and duty of fair representation claims by analogy.See . Section 10(b)'s six-month period of limitations applies to Smith's suit against the Union whether or not he was a supervisor. The Fifth Circuit therefore affirmed the district court's application of the six-month statute of limitations and its grant of summary judgment in favor of the Union. Importance of the case While it is entirely a victory for the Union, this was the first time United States District Court has decided the six-month statute of limitation of National Labor Relations Board Act is extended to the supervisory officer instead of Labor Management Act which has no statute of limitation or the customary ten-year statute of limitation under the civil law of the state (Louisiana) where the incident occurred.

Greenough (September 20, 1905 ‚Äì September 22, 1974) was the 14th and last President of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Private life and education He was born on September 20, 1905, in San Francisco, California, to Ernest Allen Greenough and Nellie Jackson. He married Jean Lytel on April 8, 1933. They had two children, Allen Lytel Jackson and Norman Jackson. He was educated at Princeton Prep School in Princeton, New Jersey until 1923. He attended Union College in Schenectady, New York, and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering in 1928. Career In 1928, he began work as assistant on Engineering Corps, Pennsylvania Railroad; subsequently, all with Pennsylvania; 1929 to 1933, assistant supervisor, track; 1933 to 1939, supervisor, track, Cincinnati, Philadelphia and New York divisions; 1939 to 1945, division engineer, Columbus and Pittsburgh divisions; 1945 to 1946, superintendent, Wilkes-Barre Division, Sunbury, Pennsylvania; 1946 to 1947, superintendent, freight transportation, Chicago; 1947 to 1948, superintendent, Maryland Division, Baltimore, Maryland; 1948 to 1950, general superintendent, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; 1950 to 1951, assistant general manager, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; 1953 to 1953, general manager, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; 1953 to 1955, vice-president, Eastern Region, Philadelphia; 1955 to 1959, vice-president, transportation and maintenance, system, headquarters, Philadelphia; 1959 to 1968, president and director, Pennsylvania Railroad.

Time magazine reported Greenough's promotion to president of the self-styled \\"Standard Railroad of the World\\" early in November 1959: \\"After the Pennsylvania Railroad's board of directors finished its regular meeting last week in Philadelphia, a telephone call went through to summon Allen J. Greenough, 54, vice president in charge of transportation and maintenance. Walking into the president's office, Greenough was hit with the biggest surprise of his career: he had just been named president of the Pennsy, jumping over the heads of other officers who had hoped to get the job. The new post put Greenough in line as heir to James M. Symes, who moved up from president to chairman.\\" New York Central merger Within a decade the vaunted Pennsylvania was gone in an ill-starred merger with arch-rival New York Central. Conflicted management teams, failure to produce an integrated computer system, internal strife, deindustrialization, Federal regulation, taxation, declining passenger and express traffic and fierce competition from trucks via the Federally subsidized interstate highway system and shipping on the Saint Lawrence Seaway. Though both the Pennsylvania and the Central struggled through the 1950s on the dividends from their large investments in border state coal haulers‚Äîthe Chesapeake and Ohio and the Norfolk and Western‚Äîthe Penn Central merger created a massive system from two weakened giants. Exacerbating the situation, the Interstate Commerce Commission foisted the nearly bankrupt New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad onto the new company. The New Haven, running between Boston and New York, was heavily involved in money-losing commuter traffic. Transportation historian George W. Hilton recounted the New Haven's infamous request to the ICC for permission to immediately discontinue more than one hundred and fifty money losing passenger trains circa 1958! John F. Stover wrote, in his second edition of American Railroads: \\"The giant new Penn Central system faced a variety of problems. One of [Penn Central President Stuart] Saunders' aids, Allen J. Greenough, said of the enlarged line: \\"This is a big dog with a lot of fleas.... We'll be scratching for a long time.\\" The Penn Central was official one railroad, but [New York] Central workers tried to follow their old rules, and Pennsylvania workers did likewise. The two old lines had very different signal and computer systems. The result in 1968 and 1969 was lost waybills lost freight shipments, even one lost train. By early 1970 a major problem was having to borrow capital at eight to ten percent for a railroad earning one or two percent. Penn Central was now losing one million dollars a day. On Sunday, June 21, 1970, Penn Central filed for bankruptcy, one of the biggest business failures in United States history.\\" Death He died September 22, 1974, at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan, New York City.

Included among the roads were the Ann Arbor, Central of New Jersey, Erie Lackawanna, Lehigh and Hudson River, Lehigh Valley, and the Reading. Conrail was privatized in 1986 and sold to CSX and Norfolk Southern between 1998 and 1999, CSX taking most of the former Central routes, and NS taking most of the former Pennsylvania components. Ironically, CSX and NS are the corporate descendants of the Appalachian coal haulers that once subsidized the Central and the Pennsylvania.

Starware Publishing Corp. 900 F.Supp. 433 was a case heard before the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida in May 1995. The case revolved around the subject of copyright infringement and exclusive rights in copyrighted works. Plaintiff Playboy Enterprises filed a motion for partial summary judgment of liability of copyright infringement against defendant Starware Publishing Corporation. Specifically, Playboy Enterprises (\\"PEI\\") argued that Starware's distribution of 53 of Playboy's images, taken from an online bulletin board, and then sold on a CD-ROM, infringed upon PEI's copyrights.Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Starware Publishing Corp., 900 F.Supp. 433 (1995). The case affirmed that it was copyright infringement, granting Playboy Enterprises the partial summary judgment. Most importantly, the case established that \\"The copyright owner need not prove knowledge or intent on the part of the defendant to establish liability for direct copyright infringement.\\"  Background  The plaintiff, Playboy Enterprises, is a privately held global media and lifestyle company founded by Hugh Marston Hefner to manage the Playboy Magazine empire. Its content and programming is available, worldwide, on television networks, websites, mobile platforms, and the radio. The defendants, Starware Publishing Corp., is profit corporation based in South Florida, which sells multimedia. PEI's motion was filed on November 2, 1994, and defendant Starware filed its opposition on November 18, 1994.Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Starware Publishing Corp., Find a Case, retrieved December 10, 2011.  Facts  Starware distributed and sold approximately 9,611 copies of a CD-ROM entitled \\"Private Pictures I\\" in the United States. It downloaded these pictures from an online bulletin board and then burned them onto the CDs. Playboy Enterprises submitted a Concise Statement of Undisputed Facts in support of its motion and shared the original photographs in question. PEI also provided registration certificates issued by the United States Copyright Office for each of the 53 photographs. Starware relied only on its assertions that PEI might not be the owner of photographs/copyright work at issue, and that the works were not copyrightable. The photos submitted by Playboy Enterprises were strikingly similar to the ones found in \\"Private Pictures I.\\" This allowed the Court to conclude that all infringing images on the CD-ROM were in fact copies of the Playboy photographs at issue. Starware did not dispute that the accused images were strikingly similar. Nor did it suggest that the ultimate source for its accused images was anything other than the PEI photographs. Nor did it obtain permission from PEI to use the photos in question. The plaintiffs moved for a partial summary judgment and argued that they had a valid copyright to the material which the defendants had distributed through CD-ROMs. The defendant, Starware alleged that a \\"substantial number\\" of copyright registrations asserted by Playboy Enterprises are for \\"collective works\\" and that it was not liable for infringement of these works because PEI might not own the underlying photographs at question.  Court Decision  The decision, authored by Judge Kenneth Ryskamp, granted Playboy Enterprises partial summary judgment on its claim against Starware for infringement of the 53 copyrighted photographs, in addition to an award of $1.1 million. This was based on two key aspects of the case. First, the court sought to determine if the case was one of copyright infringement, where the claimant must prove its ownership of the asserted copyrights and the defendant's \\"copying\\" of the original, or a \\"copy\\" of the copyrighted work.Southern Bell Tel. & Tel. v. Assoc. Telephone Directory Publishers,756 F.2d 801, 810 (11th Cir.1985). Because proving that the defendant had any knowledge or intent was not necessary for the copyright owner to establish liability for copyright infringement, the copyright registrations provided by Playboy Enterprises were prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyrights and the facts stated in the certificates, including ownership.Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Frena, 839 F.Supp. 1552, 1559 (M.D.Fla.1993). Thus, this presumption by the Court shifted the burden to Starware Corp. to disprove the validity of the registration certificates. Next, Starware Corp.'s allegation that a \\"substantial number\\" of copyright registrations asserted by Playboy Enterprises were for \\"collective works\\" and that the Corp. was therefore not liable for the infringement of these works because PEI might not own the underlying photographs. However, if a \\"collective work\\" is infringed if any copyrightable portion of the work, which is original to the copyright owner, is improperly copied by another. Furthermore, because Playboy Enterprise's Rights and Permissions director verified that each individual photograph (with one exception) was also copyrighted by PEI, Starware's claim was found to be without merit. Secondly, the court examined whether the works were copied by Starware. Copying is normally shown by proving 1) access to the copyrighted work and 2) Substantial similarity between the copyrighted work and the accused work.Original Appalachian Artworks, Inc. v. Toy Loft, Inc., 684 F.2d 821, 829 (11th Cir.1982). It can also be shown by proving a \\"striking similarity\\" between the copyrighted work and the accused work, where proof of access is absent.Ferguson v. National Broadcasting Co.,584 F.2d 111, 113 (5th Cir.1978) In this case, the defendant already admitted that the CD-ROM's with the photographs were widely distributed throughout the United States. In terms of proving whether the defendant had access to the copyrighted work, the distribution of Playboy Magazines throughout the country and technically accessible to any adult would also allow for access to photographs published therein. Additionally, it was also determined that the accused images were more than \\"strikingly similar\\"--they were \\"virtually exact copies.\\" Finally, the second part of the two part test for \\"copying\\" involved determining whether the defendant, Starware Corp. used the photographs in any of the ways described in Section 106 of the Copyright Statute.  U.S.C. Section 106: Exclusive rights in copyrighted works  This section the US Copyright Statute states that the owner of copyright under this title has the exclusive rights to do and authorize the following: # to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords # to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work # to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending; # in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works, to perform the copyrighted work publicly; # in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, to display the copyrighted work publicly; and # in the case of sound recordings, to perform the copyrighted work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission. The first and third rights particularly applied here because if a copyrighted work was used by the defendant in any of those ways, without permission of the copyright owner, it would constitute actionable copyright infringement. Specifically in terms of this case, Starware Corp. distributing nearly 10,000 copies of the CD-ROM disks containing the unauthorized photographs, violated Playboy Enterprise's exclusive right of production, under 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 106(1). Moreover, 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 106(3), the exclusive right to distribute the works was also violated here as the CD's were widely sold and distributed.

Two major kinds of such donations deserve specific consideration, charitable as well as political donations. According to a 2020 study, \\"6.3 percent of corporate charitable giving may be politically motivated, an amount 2.5 times larger than annual PAC contributions and 35 percent of federal lobbying. Absent of disclosure requirements, charitable giving may be a form of corporate political influence undetected by voters and subsidized by taxpayers.\\" Charitable donations Corporations give to charitable causes, either because of the personal convictions of influential leaders within the corporation, or more commonly to help establish the public perception that the corporation is a good corporate citizen. Types Corporate charitable giving can be divided into direct cash and non-cash contributions. Direct cash giving comes from corporate headquarters, regional offices, or company sponsored foundations. Examples of direct cash contributions include: * Community grants to support local community efforts or nonprofits - 100% of Fortune 500 companies provide some form of community grant or sponsor at least one fundraising event. * Matching gifts - Corporate donations to nonprofits as a match to employee giving. Approximately 65% of Fortune 500 companies offer these programs. * Volunteer grants - Giving to nonprofits in recognition of employee-volunteer service to that organization. Approximately 40% of Fortune 500 companies offer these programs. Non-cash contributions are contributions of equipment, supplies or time, and do not include cash contributions. Examples of non-cash contributions include: * Donation of new or used equipment or supplies, such as computers and other electronic equipment, office supplies, and targeted supplies such as clothing, canned goods, or paper products. * Use of organizational services/facilities, such as financial and administrative support, computer services, printing, mailing or copying, or targeted professional services and support. * Application of professional services, such as tax and financial advice, strategic planning and organizational development, graphic arts and copy writing, and legal assistance. Non-cash contributions can also be interpreted through an organization's policy to allow employees paid time off when performing volunteer work. Annual charitable giving figures Total corporate cash donations in 2010 are estimated to be $15.29 billion in the United States. Of that, ~80%-85% came from corporate grants and sponsorship of fundraising events while ~15%-20% or $2‚Äì$3 billion came from corporate matching gifts and volunteer grants.  Political donations  There is a wide range of models of political finance in democracies; political donations by individuals and organizations are one of many sources of funding.  United States  In the US, corporations are prohibited from making expenditures to influence federal elections. Similar restrictions exist in many state elections and have been upheld by the US Supreme Court. Corporations may make donations to Political Action Committees (PACs); PACs generally have strict limits on their ability to advocate on behalf of specific parties or candidates, or even to coordinate their activities with political campaigns. PACs are subject to disclosure requirements at the federal and state levels. The ability of corporations to engage in such independent expenditures has been subject to intense debate after the US Supreme Court struck down, on free-speech grounds, limits in Citizens United v. FEC, a case involving the creation of a film critical of Hillary Clinton by a nonprofit corporation. Donations are closely tracked by a number of organizations, including the Center for Responsive Politics (opensecrets.org). Such organizations often group donations under specific corporations, but such donations refer to contributions from individuals and PACs associated with the corporation, not \\"corporate donations\\". Corporate donations to PACs and Super PACs are a First Amendment issue and subject to intense political debate in the US. Proponents of tighter regulations of political donations by corporations argueWarwick Smith, Political donations corrupt democracy that corporate donations corrupt democracy. Other research suggests that post-election lobbying and access to politicians, rather than campaign contributions, shapes and reinforces policy decision by politiciansJohn R. Wright: Contributions, Lobbying, and Committee Voting in the U.S. House of Representatives, American Political Science Review 84(2), 1990.  Germany  In Germany, both individuals and corporations may make unlimited contributions to political parties. These contributions are partially tax exempt and partially matched by government funds; contributions of more than 10000 Euros are reportable. During the 2013 election cycle in Germany, corporations and other organizations made direct contributions to German political parties in the amount of at least 24.2 million Euros. Due to public subsidies of political parties and membership dues, such donations in Germany generally represent about 15% of the total revenue of major political parties; see Party finance in Germany.  Other countries  Australia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Turkey have no limits on either contributions for parliamentary elections or on spending on such elections. Belgium, Canada, Chile, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Poland, and Slovenia, there are limits on both contributions and spending Austria, Hungary, Italy, New Zealand, Slovakia, the United Kingdom have no limits on contributions but do have limits on spending. Finland and the United States have limits on contributions but not on spending.

The series has spawned animated film and anime adaptations. The third film was planned to be released in Japan in the summer of 2020 before being delayed due to COVID-19. Plot (based on the movie) In the Late Cretaceous Period, a female Maiasaura finds an egg and decides that the baby in the egg needs to be taken care of, so she adopts it as her own. She takes it to her nest near Egg Mountain, a volcano with a giant egg shaped rock. One fateful day, a marauding pack of Troodon attacks the nesting grounds, snatching and eating the Maiasaura eggs. The outcome of the attack resulted in the mother losing all but two of her eggs (one of which is the egg she saved). As the eggs hatched, one was born a male Maiasaura, whom the mother named Light, and from the egg she found, the baby is revealed to be a Tyrannosaurus, named Heart. The herd leader was about to kill Heart in order to prevent him from eating anyone when he gets older, but the mother Maiasaura stops him, arguing that he is a newborn and harmless. The leader then gives her the chance of leaving him in the wild where he belongs, and she was about to do so. However, she changes her mind out of guilt of abandoning Heart and leaving him alone, so she decides to move from the herd and raise her children by herself. Years later, Light and Heart now live in the forest with their mother, where they would be safe from predators and free from the herd. But Heart is unaware of his carnivorous nature and can only eat berries. While they were playing, Heart and Light fell from a cliff and a swamp, where they meet a sloth mother singing a song about tyrannosaurs and describing their appearances. The sloth sees Heart and retreats in fear, while Light jokes about the appearance of Heart, saying that he looks like the description in the song. His words makes Heart sad and he starts crying. When their mother finds them, she grounds Light about what he says and he apologizes. However, despite the fact that Heart asks their mother to not blame Light, some questions start to mess up his mind. As Heart is unable to live by eating plants and can't sustain himself of berries, he travels outside the forest and into the plains to look for some food that he could eat; unfortunately he watches a Triceratops fighting a pack of Tyrannosaurus, one of which is impaled by one of its horns and killed. Suddenly from the mist enters Baku, a particularly large Tyrannosaurus with a scar over his right eye, who slams the Triceratops to the ground, killing it. After watching the pack eat the corpse, Heart panics and tries to retreat quietly to avoid being eaten as well, not knowing he was one of them. However, one of the Tyrannosaurus named Gonza notices his presence and the fact that he smells like a herbivore. Baku asks him about his family, and Heart fearfully answered that he had a brother and a mother, not telling that they are Maiasaura. Then Baku explains the lifestyle of a predator, which makes Heart flee in panic, without noticing that Gonza was following him. After rejoining with Light, Heart tells in disdain his experience with the Tyrannosaurus, but Gonza arrives and threatens to eat Light. In panic Light yells to Heart to save himself, causing Gonza to wonder why a Maiasaura would take care of a Tyrannosaurus. Light explains that Heart is his brother, but then Gonza reveals Heart's real species, which Heart denies and attacks Gonza. He bites and rips off his tail, leaving Gonza to flee in pain, feeling betrayed. Unfortunately, upon eating the tail, Heart realizes that Gonza was telling the truth, and, upon tackling Light, that he couldn't control his predatory instincts, he decides to run away to avoid killing and eating his family. Years later, Heart is now a fully grown dinosaur with enhanced hunting and martial arts skills, what he demonstrates by beating a whole herd of Titanosaurus, and having a step forward from Gonza's pack. Meanwhile, Light is allowed to return to the herd as Heart doesn't live with them anymore. One day Heart discovers an egg which houses an Ankylosaurus. When the baby hatches, Heart tells him that he is \\"Umasou\\" (the Japanese word for delicious), and he prepares to devour him, until the baby jumps and cuddles Heart, believing that Heart was his father and that Umasou was his name, much to Heart's surprise and confusion. He decides to raise him; initially to wait until he fattens enough for him to eat, but he begins to give up this scheme after a bad dream about his old family. Umasou acts very loving toward Heart, but Heart remains emotionally distant to Umasou as he doesn't know exactly how to deal with him. Later Heart goes to hunt a Parasaurolophus, leaving Umasou waiting for him in the grass. A nearby Chilantaisaurus notices him and is about to eat him, but Heart arrives and quickly sends it flying away with a kick. Umasou cheers Heart for saving him, and Heart angrily tells him that the Chilantaisaurus could have eaten him and to stay alert for predators. The next day, Umasou wants to gather berries to eat with his father, while Heart frantically searches for Umasou. He gives up the search and loses hope, but then Umasou returns with the berries like nothing happened. Enraged, Heart yells at Umasou to go away, which makes Umasou cry and tell why he left. Heart notices the berries and apologizes for yelling at him before starting to eat to make him fell better, even starting to be moved. Umasou mentions that he got the berries from an elderly Tyrannosaurus who has grown too old to eat solid food and eats the berries, who will introduce himself as Bekon. The two go to meet him and he explains a part of Baku's story: One day, a massive pack of Giganotosaurus arrived from the south and goes on a rampage, killing everything in their path, forcing Baku to fight them by himself. The battle resulted in him losing an eye and receiving his scar, but he succeeded in defeating the Giganotosaurus and is now the king of the plains. After Bekon ask Heart how he will deal with the fact that Umasou will one day be separated from him due to their respective condition, Heart decides to train Umasou to protect himself from predators. Even after all the good time he spent with Umasou, Heart still didn't really accept him as his son as he was worried he might find out the truth, so he tricks him in having a race where, if Umasou wins, Heart would stay with him forever, and lets him run away from Heart. But Umasou enters the outlands where encounters Gonza's pack, who nearly kills him. Realizing Umasou was in danger, Heart went to the rescue and saw Gonza about to eat Umasou. Driven to a rage, Heart attacks Gonza and kept Umasou safe in his mouth, before defeating the gang with his bare martial arts skills. Then Baku appears, witnessing what Heart did, and decides to banish Heart as a punishment for beating others of his kind. Once Heart got away from the plains, he is relieved and glad to see that Umasou, even though he's weakened, is still alive and safe. But Umasou also noticed that he didn't catch him in time, so Heart finally accepts him as his son and promises to live together, and they leave the plains to find their new home. While this time, Baku went to the meeting with Bekon and the old dinosaur starts to discuss about the fact that Heart looks like Baku at his age. As Bekon begins to talk about Baku's lost egg, Baku cuts him off and says that belongs to the past. Some months later, Heart and Umasou (who had grown slightly bigger) have moved to a beach. But Heart falls from a cliff and into the ocean, where he is saved by a female Elasmosaurus called Pero Pero. Pero Pero didn't know at first that Heart was a carnivore, until the two met and got attacked by a Tylosaurus, which Heart kills by ripping off one of its flippers. Yet, Heart promised to never hurt Pero Pero, and she won't be afraid of him. After Pero Pero realizes that Egg Mountain is having high volcanic activity and tells it to Heart, he and Umasou go to save their family. On the way, as they cross Baku's territory again, their first obstacle is Gonza, who wants to get revenge for everything that Heart did to him, and he wouldn't let them pass until he's dead. The two have a very short fight, in which Heart wins by ripping a chunk off of Gonza's neck. As he lays dying, Gonza ridicules the fact that Umasou is Heart's son, telling Umasou that Heart is not his father. Umasou says that he knew this, but still considers Heart his dad, who is suddenly choked and moved to hear that. Knowing this, Gonza apologizes (and maybe forgives Heart). When Heart reaches Light's herd, his brother informs him that their mom doesn't live with the herd all the time and that she is probably in their former home in the forest. He didn't look for her because of his job in the herd as guardian. However, the herd is too afraid of the volcano to move. Out of his deception, Heart starts to scare away all the Maiasaura to move to safety. After clearing the second obstacle, Heart rushes to encounter his mother, whom at last feels relieved and warm hearted upon finding her lost son. After crying and apologizing to her for leaving so suddenly when he was young, Heart introduces Umasou, and meets his new siblings, a girl and two male twins. After the warm reunion, all the family, including Light who decided to join them, head away from the mountain, whose eruption was strong enough to blast the egg rock from the volcano. They almost escape from the eruption, but Baku appears from the volcanic dust and threatens to kill Heart since he disobeyed his order of exile. In order to protect his family, Heart accepts a duel with Baku, in which Baku uses normal Tyrannosaur attacks and movements and Heart displays quick martial arts kicks. In the midst of the battle, Heart bites Baku's neck, which proves to be a great mistake when Baku grabs Heart, leaps, and smashes him with all his weight to crush him, almost killing him. Heart's mother pleads to spare him, revealing that she is his adoptive mother. This makes Baku wonder what would she do if Heart was starving for not eating meat, to which she responds that she would let him eat her, which Baku considers nonsense. He explains that a carnivore has to eat meat every day in order to survive. At the same time, he accepts that Heart wouldn't have survived without her help, so he agrees to spare Heart and the others. As Baku lies down to recover from his wounds from the battle, he tells Heart to be strong and good with a certain emotion (implying that Baku is probably Heart's father). In the aftermath, Heart's Mom asked him if he would live with them when they reached their new home, but he refuses, telling that it would be better for everyone to stay with their own species. She agrees, guessing Heart would have wanted that, but he also denies, saying that he enjoyed being her son. The family cuddles and wave goodbye for the last time before Heart and Umasou go on their way again. During the end credits, the Maiasaura herd move on to a new home. Baku returns to the plains and Bekon welcomes him back. The movie ends with Heart and Umasou watching the egg rock of Egg Mountain fly away to outer space.

His brother was a signer of the Declaration of Independence and his nephew William Henry Harrison later became president. At the beginning of the American Revolutionary War he became lieutenant in a company of artillery from Virginia. When the state expanded its small artillery battalion into a regiment in November 1776, Harrison was appointed commander with the rank of colonel. Initially named Harrison's Continental Artillery Regiment, the unit was renamed the 1st Continental Artillery Regiment in August 1779. He joined George Washington's main army in time to fight at Monmouth. In 1780 he led his gunners at Camden and the following year he commanded Nathanael Greene's artillery at Hobkirk's Hill. Harrison's regiment Charles Harrison was born about 1740NJ Historical Society, Continental Artillery. This source gave a lifespan from 1740 to 1796. in Charles City, Virginia of parents Benjamin Harrison IV and Anne Carter.JHBL Family Genealogy, Charles Harrison. This source stated that he was born \\"about 1742\\". On 1 December 1775, the Virginia Convention authorized a state artillery company, including a captain, three lieutenants, one sergeant, four corporals, four bombardiers, eight gunners, and 48 matrosses. A committee appointed James Innis captain while Harrison, Edward Carrington, and Samuel Denney became lieutenants on 13 February 1776. The company was accepted by the Second Continental Congress on 19 March. A second company was formed and the French volunteer Dohickey Arundel appointed to lead it. The Frenchman was killed while test-firing a mortar and Innis transferred to the infantry.Wright, 70-71. The author omits mention of the 4 corporals on page 70 but includes them on page 103. The Virginia Continental Artillery Company coexisted with the second unit, the Virginia State Artillery Company, which was authorized on 11 January 1776.Wright, 336 This photo shows the home of Benjamin Harrison IV where Harrison grew up. On 26 November 1776, Congress authorized Harrison's Continental Artillery Regiment to be made up of 10 companies, including the two existing units. Assigned to the Southern Department, the regiment assembled at Williamsburg, Virginia in the spring and summer of 1777.Wright, 335-336 Harrison was named the regiment's colonel and Edward Carrington was appointed lieutenant colonel.Wright, 103 On 13 March 1778 the regiment was ordered to join the main army which was at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. At the Battle of Monmouth on 28 June 1778, Harrison and his regiment were part of Henry Knox's artillery brigade in the American order of battle.Morrissey, 88. The author did not list how many companies were present. After British commander Sir Henry Clinton threw back Charles Lee's 5,000-man advance guard, he was finally stopped in front of Washington's main line of battle.Boatner, 719-721 Clinton tried to break Lord Stirling's left flank, but the effort failed in the face of heavy musketry and effective fire delivered by a battalion of artillery under the tactical direction of Carrington.Boatner, 723 In fall 1778, Captain James Pendleton kept the regiment's orderly book. He recorded only 27 men remaining on the unit roster.Society of the Cincinnati, 22 On 10 August 1779, Harrison's regiment was renamed the 1st Continental Artillery Regiment. After two boards of generals reviewed the seniority of the officers, it was decided that the regiments of John Lamb and John Crane could not claim lineage to Knox's original Continental Artillery Regiment. Therefore, Harrison's regiment became the 1st, Lamb's the 2nd Continental Artillery Regiment, Crane's the 3rd Continental Artillery Regiment, and Thomas Proctor's the 4th Continental Artillery Regiment. Meanwhile, three Maryland artillery companies joined Harrison's regiment in 1778 on a provisional basis. They officially merged with the 1st Artillery on 9 May 1780.Wright, 149-150 The 1st Maryland Company became the 11th Company while the 2nd and 3rd Maryland consolidated as the 12th Company. Southern campaign Harrison commanded the artillery at the disastrous Battle of Camden on 16 August 1780. Carrington took three batteries of the 1st Regiment south with Johann de Kalb in 1780, but Harrison arrived \\"unexpectedly\\" to claim seniority. The two men clashed and the new commander Horatio Gates sent Carrington to reconnoiter crossings of the Dan River.Boatner, 184. Boatner's encyclopedia has an entry for Carrington but not for Harrison. At the Battle of Camden on 16 August 1780, Harrison commanded 100 artillerists and six cannons.Boatner, 163 Otho Holland Williams recalled that Harrison's guns were massed in the center near the main north-south road. One of Harrison's officers, Captain Anthony Singleton pointed out to Williams that the British troops were about away and received permission to open fire. The guns of both sides blazed away and produced a fog-like bank of smoke. When the British right wing advanced, the American militiamen on the left panicked and ran away, most without even firing a shot. The Maryland Continentals of the American right and reserve defended themselves stoutly but were enveloped and crushed with heavy losses. De Kalb was mortally wounded in the disastrous defeat.Boatner, 166-168. Though the author did not list artillery losses, it seems reasonable to assume that all six cannons were lost. Singleton survived to lead a battery at the Battle of Guilford Court House (Boatner, page 461). Harrison commanded Nathanael Greene's artillery at the Battle of Hobkirk's Hill. On this occasion he led 40 Virginia gunners and three 6-pound cannons. During the pre-battle maneuvers, Greene sent the guns back to the Lynches River to avoid capture. The British commander Lord Rawdon found out about this and advanced to the attack on 25 April 1781. Harrison's guns rejoined Greene in time for the action and were placed in a hidden position.Boatner, 504-505 As Rawdon's attack approached, Harrison's masked battery cut loose with case shot, halting the British. However, Rawdon was able to parry Greene's subsequent counterattack. Three American regiments broke and retreated, but the 5th Virginia Regiment held together and covered the retreat. With the British about to overrun the artillery, Greene sent Captain James Smith and 45 Marylanders to haul away the cannons. They drove off a troop of 60 loyalist dragoons under John Coffin, but Smith was hit and soon only 14 men remained of the group. Greene rallied some matrosses and returned to help drag the three pieces away. At length, William Washington turned up with about 80 American dragoons and saved the guns. The British tactical victory was hollow because Rawdon was soon compelled to retreat to Charleston, South Carolina.Boatner, 506-508 The 1st Regiment was reorganized into 10 companies on 1 January 1780. It was furloughed during the summer of 1783 at Winchester, Virginia and Baltimore, Maryland. On 15 November, the regiment was officially dissolved. Meanwhile, Harrison resigned his command on 1 January 1783. Congress rewarded him with the brevet rank of brigadier general on 30 September 1783.JHBL Family Genealogy, Charles Harrison Family Harrison married Mary Claiborne (19 January 1744 - 25 July 1775) and the couple had six known children.

The eruption and the fire that followed it put an end to the hope of Poland becoming a \\"second Kuwait\\". It took more than a month for Polish, Soviet and Hungarian firefighters to completely extinguish the fire.History of Gmina Karlino \\"The fire was finally brought under control on the night of 13 January\\". The eruption was the result of an extensive search for underground oil deposits that took place in the area in 1980.  Background  In 1980, the town of Karlino became a symbol of Polish hopes for a \\"new Kuwait\\"Karlino - sen o potƒôdze, Radio RMF FM because of the discovery of oil deposits surrounding the town. At that time Poland was in a severe economic crisis, foreign debt was mounting, and both the Communist authorities and the nation hoped to be able to sell oil from Karlino to the West and pay off the debt with the proceeds. The oil deposits took on a symbolic role as a further sign of a better future, after the election of John Paul II and the creation of Solidarity.KARLINO - MARZENIA O WIELKIEJ ROPIE, Monday, January 24 2011 Among disappointed officials who visited the site after the fire were First Secretary of the Communist Party Stanis≈Çaw Kania and Solidarity chairman Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa.  The eruption  At 5:30 p.m. on December 9, 1980, in a 2800-m deep drill hole designated Daszewo - 1, located in the village of Krzywoploty (4.5 kilometers from Karlino), a giant eruption of oil and natural gas took place. Soon afterwards, a fire broke out, with flames reaching up to 130 m. The temperature of the burning mix of gas and oil reached 900 ¬∞C, and in spite of sub-zero temperatures, leaves appeared on frozen trees nearby. During the night of December 9/10, four workers were burned and had to be taken to hospital in Bia≈Çogard. Eighteen teams of firefighters arrived at the site, and nearby households were evacuated. The Szczecin-bound lanes of the main East - West National Route Number 6 (Droga Krajowa nr 6) adjacent to the fire were closed. Workers' equipment and shacks were destroyed. Oil pressure reached 560 atmospheres, and the fire was visible from several km away. At that time, it was one of the biggest oil eruptions in the history of Europe.30 lat temu pali≈Ça siƒô ropa pod Karlinem, dziennik pl, 2010-12-12  Extinguishing operation  On December 11, specialized units of the Polish Army, firefighters, police, a mining search and rescue unit from Krak√≥w, and specialists from Krak√≥w's AGH University of Science and Technology began working on protecting the local area from the flames. News of the fire was front-page news throughout Poland, with headlines such as \\"Days hot like oil\\", \\"Karlino without a Christmas break\\", \\"Karlino's torch\\", and \\"Artillery and sappers in Karlino\\". Five days later, on December 16, firefighters from Hungary and the Soviet Union joined the Poles, and command of the operation was taken by engineer Adam Kilar and Soviet expert Leon Kalyna from Poltava, who himself was of Polish ancestry.30 lat temu pali≈Ça siƒô ropa pod Karlinem, onet.pl, 12.10.2010 By December 18, the area adjacent to the drill hole was cleared of burned and destroyed steel parts of the oil well and a road had been constructed to the locations of two new wells. The operation to extinguish the fire was very elaborate and preparation lasted almost a month, until January 2, 1981. A special pipeline was constructed, and the population of Poland was vividly interested in these events. Every day, hundreds of letters came to Karlino with suggestions on how to put the fire out. After long consideration, the specialists came up with the following solution. First, remnants of the destroyed oil well and blowout preventer were removed. The well was removed by a specially constructed tractor, equipped with a 30-m hook arm. The preventer, however, was destroyed by a cannon from a distance of 25 m. The task was to aim at a small crack between the flanges. First an 85 mm cannon was used, then a 122 mm howitzer, and finally on December 28, a 152 mm cannon-howitzer managed to destroy the preventer. After all the preparations, the fire was extinguished on January 8, 1981, almost a month after the eruption. The local Karlino Chronicle wrote: \\"At 10:42 a.m. a stream of water from 23 cannons was aimed at the burning geyser of oil. After 16 minutes, the fire went out, and specialists removed the damaged flanges\\". On January 10, 1981, at 3:38 p.m., a new preventer was installed, and the stream of oil was stopped. That was the end of the operation, after 32 days. Altogether, some 1000 people were involved in the mission. The new preventer was constructed at May 1 Works in Ploie»ôti, Romania. It weighed 11 tons, and was lifted by a 100-ton crane with a 60-meter arm. The entire operation cost about 300 million zlotys, and during the fire, some 20,000‚Äì30,000 tons of oil and some 30-50 million cubic meters of natural gas burned. There was one injury in the extinguishing operation: a soldier was slightly burned.  Aftermath  The investigation established that the primary cause of the eruption was looseness in the blowout preventer. Most likely, gaskets were damaged and the preventer was not locked in time. The fire was caused by gasoline engines driving the pumps. Another reason of the eruption was an inaccurate geologic assessment: specialists had expected to encounter oil at a depth of 2,952 m underground, but it turned out to be at 2,792 meters, 160 m higher than expected. On January 16, 1981, at 3:55 p.m., a cargo train with seventeen tank cars filled with oil left Karlino rail station, heading towards a refinery in Trzebinia. Hopes were high, but it turned out that the oil deposits were sparse, and after a few years, the well ran dry.

Antona was a mentor to several other successful Birmingham chefs early in their careers, including Glynn Purnell, Luke Tipping and Andy Waters, and has been described in The Times as \\"the godfather of modern Birmingham food\\". Antona was born in Cuckfield, West Sussex to a Greek-Cypriot family, and was brought up in Chiswick, London.

From 1987 he spent three years as Head Chef at Birmingham's Plough and Harrow Hotel, at a time when its restaurant was among the finest in the Midlands. Antona originally opened Simpsons in Kenilworth, Warwickshire in September 1993, the restaurant's name being taken from that of the chemists shop owned by his father-in-law that used to occupy the property. Simpsons was awarded a Michelin Star in 1999 and moved to a grade II-listed Georgian villa in Edgbaston, Birmingham in 2004, by which time it had built a European-wide reputation. Since then, Antona has opened a second restaurant in Kenilworth, The Cross, which was awarded a Michelin Star in 2014 just shortly after opening.

They were conservative land owning aristocrats and many of them were very wealthy. The Philaidae produced two of the most famous generals in Athenian history: Miltiades the Younger and Cimon. The Philaids claimed descent from the mythological Philaeus, son of Ajax. The family originally came from Brauron in Attica. Later a prominent branch of the clan were based at Lakiadae west of Athens. In the late 7th century BC a Philaid called Agamestor married the daughter of Cypselus, the powerful tyrant of Corinth. In 597 BC a man named Cypselus was archon of Athens. This Cypselus was probably grandson of the Corinthian tyrant of the same name and son of Agamestor. Some years before 566 BC, a member of the Philaid clan, Hippocleides, was a suitor for the hand of Agariste, the daughter of the influential tyrant of Sicyon, Cleisthenes. However Hippocleides lost out to Megacles from the rival Alcmaeonid clan when Cleisthenes was unimpressed with a drunken Hippocleides who stood on his head and kicked his heels in the air at a banquet.Herodotus 6.129-130 Tyrants of the Thracian Chersonese In c.560-556 BC a Thracian tribe, the Dolonci, offered the rule of the Thracian Chersonese (a peninsula in a strategic location dominating the grain route through the Hellespont) to the Philaid Miltiades the Elder, the son of Cypselus the archon. Miltiades accepted the offer and became tyrant of the Chersonese. He built a wall across the Bulair Isthmus to protect the peninsula from raiders from Thrace. Pisistratus, the tyrant of Athens, did not object to Miltiades leaving Athens to set himself up as a semi-independent ruler on the far side of the Aegean Sea as it removed a potential rival from the city and gave him a useful role as an ally of Athens in a strategically important location. Meanwhile a Philaid called Cimon Coalemos, ('coalemos' meaning simpleton), won the prestigious Olympic chariot race three times in succession during the rule of Pisistratid tyrants. He earned a recall from exile by dedicating his second victory to Pisistratus but when he unwisely continued his winning streak by notching up a famous third consecutive Olympic victory he fell foul of Pisistratus' sons Hippias and Hipparchus who had him assassinated.Herodotus 6.103 Around 534 BC Miltiades the Elder died and the tyranny of the Thracian Chersonese passed to his step- brother's son Stesagoras. Then in c.520 BC Stesagoras was succeeded by his brother Miltiades the Younger, son of Cimon Coalemus. This younger Miltiades cemented good relations with neighbouring Thracian tribes by marrying Hegesipyle daughter of the Thracian king Olorus. Miltiades the Younger also served with King Darius I of Persia during his campaign against the Scythians in c.513 BC and when the Greek contingents were left guarding a bridge over the Danube River Miltiades tried to convince his fellow Greeks to demolish the bridge so as to leave the Persian king stranded in Scythia (or so he later claimed). Miltiades returns to Athens Temple of Zeus at Olympia. Archaeological Museum of Olympia After Miltiades took part in the failed Ionian Revolt against the Persian Empire he fled the Chersonese and returned to Athens in c.493 BC. He survived a prosecution for tyranny and when the Persians landed at Marathon in 490 BC Miltiades, as one of ten generals (strategoi) played the major part in winning the battle for Athens. Miltiades now enjoyed great prestige at Athens as the victor of Marathon. The following year he was given command of forces which besieged the pro-Persian island of Paros. However the expedition was ill-fated as Miltiades failed to capture the city of Paros and fell off a wall during the siege operations and arrived back in Athens with gangrene in his leg. The debacle of the Parian expedition led Miltiades' enemies to renew their attacks on him in court and just one year after the victory at Marathon Miltiades the Younger died from his infected leg. Cimon leads the war against Persia Pieces of broken pottery (Ostracon) as voting tokens for ostracism. The second ostracon from the top nominates Cimon son of Miltiades for ostracism. After the Greek victories over Persia at Salamis, Plataea and Mycale in 480-479 BC the Athenians soon took the lead in launching an offensive against Persian forces in the Aegean region. The Philaid Cimon, son of Miltiades the Younger and grandson of Cimon the Olympic victor, became the leading general of this offensive phase of the Persian Wars. Cimon drove the Persians out of the city of Eion in Thrace in 477-476 BC. After clearing pirates from the island of Scyros and putting down a rebellion on Naxos Cimon in 466 BC launched a bold attack on large Persian land and naval forces gathering at the Eurymedon River in Pamphylia. In the greatest victory of his career Cimon led the Athenian and Delian League forces to a crushing double victory over the Persians destroying the Persian fleet while heavily defeating their army. Later Cimon expelled the Persians from the Thracian Chersonese and put down a revolt on Thasos. He was acquitted on a charge of bribery largely through the efforts of his half-sister Elpinice. In c.462 BC Cimon encouraged the Athenians to send military aid to the Spartans who were trying to put down a major revolt by the Helots in the wake of an earthquake which had heavily damaged Sparta. But the conservative Spartans became worried by the revolutionary democratic spirit of the Athenian troops and sent Cimon and his army back home to Athens. War between Athens and Sparta soon followed this rebuff and Cimon as a prominent pro-Spartan advocate was ostracised from Athens for ten years. He was recalled in 451 BC to lead an Athenian attack against the Persians in Cyprus but he died at the Siege of Citium. Thucydides Thucydides, son of Melesias, the leader of the anti- Periclean conservative party during the 440s BC, was a relative of Cimon and a member of the Philaid clan. Thucydides, son of Olorus, the great historian of the Peloponnesian War was also a Philaid according to the biographer Plutarch who notes that his remains were returned to Athens and placed in Cimon's family vault and that his father's name, Olorus, was the same as Cimon's grandfather.Plutarch, Cimon 4.1. Later Philaids Lacedaimonius the son of Cimon was named after Lacedaimon, another name for Sparta. This was an indication of the admiration his father Cimon felt for the Spartans and their way of life. Lacedaimonius was one of the three Athenian commanders at the Battle of Sybota in 433 BC. Epicurus the philosopher (341 BC‚Äì270 BC) was descended from Athenian settlers on the island of Samos and was of the Philaid clan.Alexander to Actium: the historical evolution of the Hellenistic age - Peter Green - University of California Press 1990 - pg 58 Eurydice of Athens, a descendant of Miltiades the Younger, married Ophellas the Macedonian who was ruler of Cyrene.

Case 2:10-CV-01356 Document 1 On September 27, 2010, Democratic Underground filed a counterclaim, arguing that Democratic Underground was not responsible for the posting, and that the excerpt posted to the site was a fair use.Righthaven LLC. v. Democratic Underground LLC. Case 2:10-CV-01356-RLH-RJJ Democratic Underground sought favorable judgment and attorney's fees, and demanded a jury trial for all triable issues of fact. On November 15, 2010, Righthaven moved to voluntarily dismiss the case with prejudice. This would avoid having a ruling on the case that could set a precedent for its other cases.Opsahl, Kurt, Democratic Underground Responds to Righthaven Copyright Troll Lawsuit. Dec 8, 2010. On December 7, Democratic Underground requested that the court deny the motion for dismissal and grant summary judgment in DU's favor. Court decision On June 14, 2011, Judge Roger L. Hunt found that Stephens Media had not transferred any copyrights to Righthaven, but merely a \\"right to sue,\\" which is not a transferable right under copyright law.Masnick, Mike, Judge Rules That Righthaven Lawsuit Was A Sham; Threatens Sanctions. June 14, 2011. Since Righthaven did not own the copyright for which it was filing the lawsuit, Hunt dismissed the case for lack of standing. In addition, since Righthaven had failed to identify Stephens Media as a financially interested party, Hunt ordered Righthaven to show cause why it should not be sanctioned for \\"flagrant misrepresentation to the Court.\\" On July 15, 2011, Hunt ruled that Righthaven misrepresented its relationship with Stephens Media and Stephens Media's financial interest in the lawsuit, and sanctioned it $5,000. Righthaven was further ordered to file the transcript of the ruling in all the hundreds of other copyright cases it had brought forth against other parties in Nevada. After requesting and receiving a stay of the monetary sanction, Righthaven sought another extension which the court did not grant.Anderson, Nate, Righthaven, still angering judges, finally pays cash for its mistakes. Aug 3, 2011. Public response This ruling was widely reported on by various blogs, where it was generally well received. The case has been widely regarded as a legal victory against copyright trolls.Green, Steve, Ruling that Righthaven misled court likely to be felt in other cases.

Jul 15, 2011. The suit was the first of several major losses for Righthaven on grounds that it lacked standing to sue, and was ordered to pay the attorneys' fees of several of its defendants. Unable to pay those fees and sanctions, Righthaven was forced into receivership later in 2011.

Since the 1990s it is the major NGO operating in Tigray.  Emergence  During the war, working in the areas under the control of the TPLF, REST operated over 60 schools and 53 clinics. The organization had a literacy programme, which claimed to have educated 405,834 persons in the period of 1981 to 1983.

In 1981 the Emergency Relief Desk was set up in Khartoum, as a consortium of Scandinavian ecumenical NGOs cooperating with REST and the Eritrean Relief Association (the humanitarian wing of the EPLF). The ERD provided food supplies to the Sudanese border, where it was picked up by REST and ERA to be distributed in Tigray and Eritrea.Duffield, Mark.

New York: Zed Books, 2002. pp. 251-252 However, at the onset of the 1984-1985 famine REST suffered from logistical constraints. The organization had only 35 trucks, out of which many were in bad shape. Unable to cope with the humanitarian disaster, REST and TPLF decided to encourage Tigrayans to seek food at distribution centres operated by the Addis Ababa government.Inquai, Solomon.

The organization lobbied, through its office in Khartoum, that the ICRC would send two helicopters to spray against locusts (an operation that eventually got the necessary go-ahead permission from the government in Addis Ababa). The locust problem again returned in 1988. REST also organized, along with TPLF, a volunteer force that would spray crops on the ground.

Subsequent editions of the book have been published in the US and India, and foreign (non-English) editions have also been published in several languages.Non-US editions of Nilgiri Press Books (accessed 17 December 2011)}. The book's original subtitle was Strategies for uncovering your hidden spiritual resources. In its second edition in 1996, as part of a 3-book series entitled Classics of Christian InspirationThe 3-volume Classics of Christian Inspiration includes Love never faileth, Original goodness, and Seeing with the eyes of love(, , , respectively). the book was subtitled Eknath Easwaran on the beatitudes of the Sermon on the Mount. Across its various editions, Original Goodness has been reviewed in newspapers, magazines, and professional journals. Topics covered All editions of Original Goodness contain 9 chapters. After the first introductory chapter, each of the remaining 8 chapters offers a practical commentary on one of the Beatitudes, as shown in the table (below, at right). The first chapter opens with a quotation from the 13th century Christian mystic Meister Eckhart: > I have spoken at times of a light in the soul, a light that is uncreated and > uncreatable... to the extent that we can deny ourselves and turn away from > created things, we shall find our unity and blessing in that little spark in > the soul, which neither space nor time touches.in Original Goodness, p. 7 > (1996 edition), where elipses also appear between \\"uncreatable\\" and \\"to.\\" Easwaran states that these words, \\"addressed to ordinary people... testify to a discovery about the nature of the human spirit as revolutionary as Einstein's theories about the nature of the universe.

If truly understood, that discovery would transform the world we live in at least as radically as Einstein's theories changed the world of science..... If we could grasp the mystery of Eckhart's 'uncreated light in the soul'... the transformation in our thinking would set our world right side up\\" (Original Goodness, 1996 edition, pp. 7-8). Easwaran claims that \\"if we could grasp the mystery of Eckhart's 'uncreated light in the soul' - surely no more abstruse than nuclear physics - the transformation in our thinking would set our world right side up.\\" He explains that behind \\"Eckhart's passionate sermons, straining to convey the Absolute in the words of the street and marketplace,\\" were \\"essentially, four principles that Leibnitz would later call the Perennial Philosophy, because they have been taught from age to age in culture after culture.\\" These principles are that 1) there is a \\"divine core of personality which cannot be separated from God,\\" 2) \\"this divine essence can be realized,\\" 3) \\"this discovery is life's real and highest goal,\\" and 4) \\"when we realize this goal, we discover simultaneously that the divine within ourselves is one and the same in all - all individuals, all creatures, all of life.\\" The chapter explains that \\"in this book, a mystic is one who not only espouses these principles... but lives them,\\" resulting in \\"unfailing compassion, fearlessness, equanimity... these are demanding criteria.\\" Only the \\"great mystics\\"  from whom he quotes throughout the book - can be said to fully meet these criteria. After further elaborating on shifts in perspective that accompany this realization, the chapter goes on to argue that \\"there comes a time in the growth of civilizations, as with individuals, when the life-and-death questions of material existence have been answered, yet the soul still thirsts and physical challenges cease to satisfy.\\" > Then we stand at a crossroads: for without meaningful aspiration, the human > being turns destructive. Spiritual fulfillment is an evolutionary > imperative. Like a snake that must shed its skin to grow, our industrial > civilization must shed its material outlook or strangle in outgrown ideals > whose constructive potential has been spent. Easwaran then argues that whatever one's religious beliefs - \\"or even if formalized religion is anathema\\"  it is possible to uncover one's core of goodness through meditation, by which he means \\"a specific interior discipline which is found in every major religion, though called by different names.\\" Easwaran gives a brief summarysee pp. 31-33 of the 1996 edition. of a method of meditating on inspired textual passages, such as the Prayer of Saint Francis, the Beatitudes themselves, or other texts he has collected and recommends.\\"You will find it helpful to keep adding to your repertoire so that the passages you meditate on do not grow stale. My book God Makes the Rivers to Flow contains other passages that I recommend, drawn from many traditions. But whatever your background, I suggest you begin by giving Saint Francis a try\\" (Original Goodness, p. 32, 1996 edition). (he states that full instructions are available in his book Passage Meditation). He explains that by meditation, he means the systematic training of one's attention \\"to turn inward and dwell continuously on a single focus within consciousness, until, after many years, we become so absorbed in the object of our contemplation that... we forget ourselves completely.\\" Then, > In that moment, when we may be said to be empty of ourselves, we are utterly > full of what we are dwelling on. This is the central principle of > meditation: we become what we meditate on. The task of making space for the realization of God is challenging, however, and Easwaran quotes Eckhart as stating that \\"There is no greater valor nor no sterner fight\\" because \\"he who would be what he ought to be must stop being what he is.\\" The remainder of the book then \\"take[s] up the Beatitudes one by one as strategies for winning the war within.\\" In doing so, it quotes the perspectives and testimony of numerous mystics, primarily Western, but also Eastern. The book also at several places compares mystical perspectives with modern literary, scientific, and cultural perspectives, mentioning or quoting figures ranging from William James, Werner Heisenberg and Carl Sagan to Edmund Hillary, Ogden Nash, and George Bernard Shaw. The most recurring focus is the perspectives of mystics, including William Law, Baruch Spinoza, Bernard of Clairveaux, Catherine of Genoa, Hans Denck, Brother Lawrence, Teresa of Avila, Margery Kemp, the Cloud of Unknowing, Patanjali, and Mahatma Gandhi. Reception The National Catholic Reporter, suggested that Original Goodness could be helpful for those who are \\"looking for a positive, upbeat book to help you pray.\\" In the Toronto Journal of Theology, Mark Steed stated that the book \\"presents a methodology for meditation, and does it in a gentle creative manner.... The process and presentation are uniquely in step with life and living.\\" Furthermore, > Each chapter takes the reader further into a personal relationship with self > through a fresh and readily available understanding of the Beatitudes, thus > preparing the way for personal communion with God. An instruction... is > developed for each beatitude and each chapter stands alone and can be > revisited as often as needed. Steed also stated that Easwaran \\"gives no admonition as to the correct way of meditating, but suggests general strategies for ease in accomplishing this holy work.\\" He cautioned that the book at times \\"seems to over-emphasize the routine as if it alone will guarantee a relationship with God. Still, Original Goodness is a modern-day gift for all seeking a method of meditation to fit in comfortably with daily routine... it is practical, simple and a delight to read.\\" Prairie Messenger, a Roman Catholic publication, stated that each of the book's chapters \\"contains a wealth of wise observations on life today with special emphasis on the mystics and how daily practice of meditation transforms life.\\" It also stated that \\"the author's reaping of human wisdom and divine inspiration is shared with obvious concern for humanity's welfare,\\" and that \\"people who have read the books and listened to the voice\\" of the author are aware of \\"that same quality of authority\\" that impressed the \\"crowds gathered round Jesus... because he spoke with authority.\\" In the Bulletin of Monastic Interreligious Dialogue, James Conner wrote that > Original Goodness is the phrase Easwaran uses to signify the spark of > divinity hidden in everyone of us. It means that the spiritual resources > everyone needs‚Äîlove, compassion, meaning, hope, freedom from fear‚Äîare > already ours. We simply have to uncover what we already have and are. He stated that the book \\"traces our current environmental problems to a single source: our mistaken understanding of who we are and what the universe is like,\\" and that it draws heavily on the Christian mystics and on the Gospel. In The Hindu, C. S. Ramakrishnan wrote that \\"Life is a grand challenge and the rightful place of every one of us is at the summit of living.

Early life  James Newman was born in London in 1903 the son of Charles Arnold and Kate Newman, n√©e Beck. He was one of three sons of whom two, James and Charles, became doctors. He attended Shrewsbury School followed by Magdalene College at Cambridge University where he gained a natural sciences tripos. He qualified with his MRCS, LRCP in 1927, having completed his clinical years at Kings College Hospital in London. In 1929 he gained his MB, BChir, Cambridge.  Career  Newman's first positions were in London at the Royal Chest Hospital, Drury Lane Dispensary and the Fountain Hospital. He gained a Diploma in Public Health (DPH) in 1931 and a MD Cantab in 1933; his thesis, later published as an article, was on the thyroid and intellectual disability. He practised in public health, first as assistant medical officer of health in Southampton and from 1933 in the same position to the London County Council with responsibility for the East End. He became deputy medical officer of health in West Sussex in 1936 the same year he gained the MRCP. During World War II he was medical officer in charge of mobile first aid posts in Warwickshire and for ambulance services in Coventry. He wrote on various aspects of his public health work, including a study of the incidence of impetigo in Southampton and an outbreak of infectious hepatitis in the Lavant Valley. In 1947 he emigrated to New Zealand where he became the medical officer of health for Northland, based in Whangarei. During the 1948 polio epidemic he did not close schools or restrict attendance at public functions in areas where there were no polio cases, an approach which was supported by other doctors. This brought him into conflict with Dr George McCall Smith, the medical superintendent of the Rawene Hospital in the Hokianga, who demanded widespread closure of schools and shops. Newman resigned as medical officer of health in 1949 citing difficulties with the bureaucracy of government which hampered the work of the district health offices, the Official Secrets Act which prevented relevant information being used for the education of the public, and the lack of recognition in the public service of professional qualifications and experience. He returned to clinical medicine in 1950 as a registrar and then specialist at Green Lane Hospital in Auckland. In 1952 he was appointed medical superintendent of Cornwall Hospital which catered for obstetrics and gynaecology and geriatrics. It was here that he became dedicated to improving standards of care for the elderly, in hospitals, rest homes and in the community. He wrote an unpublished history of the hospital.Newman, James. 1982. History of the Cornwall Hospital: the development of geriatrics in New Zealand; a history of the hospital over a 30 year period. OCLC 973579261. In 1953 he became MRACP and was elected FRACP in 1959. In 1959 he became medical superintendent of Green Lane Hospital. Summing up the state of geriatric care in New Zealand he advocated for geriatrics to care for the whole person rather than just treating disease, and for better services and facilities, such as geriatric annexes to general hospitals. He called for better prevention and management of incontinence in patients in hospitals and rest homes by modifying institutional routines to suit the patient. In 1961 he undertook an overseas tour to look at care of the elderly and to attend an international conference on geriatrics in San Francisco. Calling on the examples he had seen in Britain, Europe and the United States he firmly advocated for better housing and the importance of social contact for the elderly. In Z√ºrich, Oslo, London and San Francisco he visited a number of clubs for older people which reduced social isolation. Newman believed that while New Zealand governments had addressed the needs of families with its state housing programme the needs of the elderly had been ignored by central and local government. He was not a whole-hearted advocate for retirement villages as they risked segregating the elderly. He wrote \\"It is time for a positive drive at the heart of the problem which is simply to help our older citizens to live where they belong, as sharers of the community they have helped to build.\\" He considered that one housing option for the elderly might be achieved by redeveloping central city areas to provide high-rise buildings of several storeys where older people could live close to ordinary life. He visited Sturminster Newton in England where in the 1960s the local council had provided a high proportion of retirement dwellings in relation to the whole population. Based on what he saw at Sturminster Newton, he concluded that small groups of six to twelve dwellings arranged around three or four sides of a court would be an ideal model for housing; this would enable easy delivery of services or supervision or support, where needed, by a housing manager. He believed that the best care of the elderly could be achieved by their living in the community in suitable housing, which would enable them to care for themselves. Newman retired in 1968 as required by the Auckland Hospital Board's compulsory retirement rule. He was critical of a compulsory retirement age arguing that older people were still useful and could contribute to the workforce and economy. After his retirement he continued in various roles as medical officer to the Blood Transfusion Service and the Disabled Servicemen's Re-establishment League (known from 1974 as the Rehabilitation League). As well as writing for medical journals he wrote more broadly for the general public. From 1957 to 1969 he edited and wrote for the New Zealand Family Doctor magazine, published by Wilson and Horton publishers of the New Zealand Herald. He wrote the Family Doctor column in the New Zealand Herald for 25 years. His last column was published on the day of his funeral in 1983. In it he wrote that solving housing problems such as lowering the cost of mortgages, providing low-cost rental housing and promoting inner city areas for residential purposes would contribute more for the health of the community than building hospitals. Newman had a particular interest in medical history and published on the English physician William Harvey, scientific hoaxes, early medical practice in New Zealand and apothecary jars. His collection of apothecary jars is held by the Ernest and Marion Davis Library in Auckland. He was a founding member of the Auckland Medical Historical Society. Apart from his contribution to the field of geriatrics he was also known for his qualities of sympathy and compassion for patients and as a clinical teacher. He died in Auckland on 17 October 1983.  Personal life  He married Margaret Cannon in London in 1932 and they had one son and two daughters.  Honours and awards  In the 1975 Queen's Birthday Honours, Newman was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for public services, for services to the care of geriatrics.

History  A \\"luxurious landmark\\" for its period, the Ebner brothers built the 36-room hotel themselves on the site of previous hotels at 116 1/2 K Street, close to the Sacramento River‚Äîa major source of transportation throughout the area at that time. The cupola that rose high enough to mark the skyline was an indicator to incoming travelers who could see it that they had nearly reached Sacramento. Charles Ebner, in addition to managing the hotel, also ran a liquor business from the hotel's basement. One source of pride for the hotel was the fact that John Sutter had been known to have lodged there as he was a friend of the Ebner brothers and frequented their saloon. By 1863 the Ebner brothers leased out the management of the hotel so that they could focus on their liquor-selling prospects. The hotel reportedly had a good reputation until the 1870s when the railroad moved into the area, changing the feel for the neighborhood, and other, bigger hotels were located closer to modern day Downtown Sacramento. The section of Sacramento that Ebner's Hotel was located in was now referred to as \\"West End.\\" In time the region was to be known as a slum and Ebner's Hotel to be classified as a flophouse. In the 1930s the area began to fall into disrepair as transportation moved from the rivers to roads, leaving the area, in essence, and the hotel itself began to draw the homeless. In their 1980 report of the building, the Historic American Buildings Survey noted that the facade had been stripped of its ornamentation and a city historian noted that the once famed cupola likely had been removed when bits and pieces had chipped off due to neglect. Original Ebner's Hotel, July 1965 21st century As the building entered the 21st century, it was one of two buildings still in existence in Old Sacramento that had not been rehabilitated and one of the few original buildings of Sacramento left. The City of Sacramento responded to requests for demolition by hiring an engineering firm to assess it. It was ultimately deemed that the structure was too unsound to repair. The city then deliberated on whether to stabilize the current building (sans repairs) or whether to raze it, with many local vendors calling for demolition of the building as its condition required that alley access near it be cut off‚Äîthus reducing foot traffic to stores. The city eventually decided to demolish the building and replace it with a \\"rebuilt replica.\\" References Buildings and structures in Sacramento County, California California Historical Landmarks Hotel buildings completed in 1856 Hotels established in 1856 ","title":"Ebner's Hotel"},{"id":"34107951","text":"Wharetutu Anne Newton (1827?-1870) was a New Zealand NgƒÅi Tahu founding mother.

These collective societies are responsible for granting permission to use the works they manage and setting out what conditions users of their works must follow. Examples of collective societies in Canada include: Christian Video Licensing International (licensing audiovisual programs to religious institutions) and the Canadian Broadcasters Rights Agency (licensing of programming owned by Canadian television stations and networks.) Reasons justifying the practice of collective administration of copyrights often pertain to debates over the economic efficiency of such policies. Collective administration of copyrights in Canada differs from collective administration policies in other common law jurisdictions such as the United States and United Kingdom. Consequently, the justifications for Canadian collective administration will not necessarily be identical to that of other systems. Legal Regime The expression \\"collective society\\" was defined in Canada by the Bill C-32 amendment of the Copyright Act of Canada in 1997. Although Parliament was dissolved before Bill C-32 made it through its second reading, Bill C-11, which contains identical language, has since been reintroduced by Parliament: This definition divides collective societies into four legal regimes: music and performing rights, general collective administration, particular cases (retransmissions and certain educational uses), and private copying levies. Music Performing Rights The performance or telecommunication of musical works and sound recordings of musical works is regulated in s.67 of the Copyright Act. Although authors may theoretically protect their copyrighted works without participating in a collective, in practice the Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada (SOCAN) holds virtually all musical works performed in Canada within its repertoire.Daniel J. Gervais. \\"A Uniquely Canadian Institution: The Copyright Board of Canada\\" An Emerging Intellectual Property Paradigm. Ed. Ysolde Gendreau. Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar, 2008. 197-223. pg 200 General Regime Voluntary licensing schemes that do not fall under s.67 fall instead within s.70.1 barring the existence of another applicable regulatory scheme. Nonetheless, collective management organizations under s.67 collect and distribute more funds than those under s.70.1. In practice, the following types of copyrights are covered by the general regime: *reprography is regulated by Access Copyright or COPIBEC *mechanical rights *visual arts *sound recordings and music videos *audiovisual and multimedia rights *off-air program taping *other areas Retransmissions and Use by Educational Institutions Sections 71-76 of the Copyright Act create a regime regulating involuntary licences for the retransmission of distant radio and televisions signals and the reproduction and public performance by education institutions of radio and television programs for educational or training purposes. Eight retransmission copyright management organizations are covered at least in part by this regime: *Border Broadcasters' Inc. *Canadian Broadcasters Rights Agency *Canadian Retransmission Collective *Canadian Retransmission Right Association *Copyright Collective of Canada *FWS Join Sports Claimants *Major League Baseball Collective of Canada *Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada Private Copying Private copying of sound recordings is dealt with by a regime established in 1998 specifically for that purpose. This regime makes an exception to copyright infringement for copies of music for private use. The regime does not involve licensing. Instead it remunerates copyright holders by collecting funds through the Canadian Private Copying Collective and sets out a share of these funds which all eligible authors, performers, and makers or record producers are entitled.Daniel J. Gervais. \\"A Uniquely Canadian Institution: The Copyright Board of Canada\\" An Emerging Intellectual Property Paradigm. Ed. Ysolde Gendreau. Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar, 2008. 197-223. pg 206 The Copyright Board The Copyright Board of Canada is an independent administrative tribunal consisting of at most five members appointed to five year terms by the government. A small permanent staff is provided to the Board which includes a Secretary General, General Counsel and Director of Research and Analysis. Unique among Canadian regulatory agencies, the Chairman of the Board tends to be drawn from sitting or retired judges of a superior court. The reasons for this are entirely historical.Daniel J. Gervais. \\"A Uniquely Canadian Institution: The Copyright Board of Canada\\" An Emerging Intellectual Property Paradigm. Ed. Ysolde Gendreau. Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar, 2008. 197-223. pg 210 Procedures Proposed tariffs must be filed before March 31 of the year before the year in which the tariff will come into effect. Proposed tariffs are published by the Board in the Canada Gazette. Objections by users to this proposal must be filed within 60 days following the Gazette's publication. These objections may then be decided before a panel with the procedures and timetable issued by the Board. Although the rules of evidence are not binding for the Board, the Board does provide written reasons for its decision.Daniel J.

Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar, 2008. 197-223. pg 211 Criticisms of Collective Administration Delays and Inefficiencies The Copyright Board's ability to handle the volume of complaints that arise from collective administration of copyright has often been characterized as slow and expensive. Legal scholars have argued that a number of structural elements of the Canadian system contribute to these inefficiencies including mandatory filing of tariffs by collective management organizations and the Board's inability to award costs.Daniel J. Gervais. \\"A Uniquely Canadian Institution: The Copyright Board of Canada\\" An Emerging Intellectual Property Paradigm. Ed. Ysolde Gendreau. Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar, 2008. 197-223. pg 218 Formation of Unnecessary Monopolies It can be argued that collective administration of copyright creates monopolies that lead to economic inefficiencies. Collective management organizations, for example, are only capable of categorizing different copyrighted works into broad categories due to the limitations of regulatory specificity. Consequently, some copyrighted works will be licensed according to the average value of the works in the same category and not the value of the specific work. The failure to provide a license based on the value of the specific work in question means that payments to copy copyrighted works do not reflect the actual value of the copying. Legal scholars such as Ariel Katz have argued that these inefficiencies may be unnecessary as there exist reasonable alternatives to collective administration of copyright, especially with the immergence of new technology that might facilitate alternative systems of managing copyright licensing. The idea that effective administration of copyright licenses necessitates single entity monopolies may be argued against, for example, by considering copyright regimes in which licensing is regulated by multiple collective management organizations without any apparent ill-effect. In addition Katz cites the \\"superstar phenomenon\\" which recognizes that the vast majority of copyright royalties are payments for works belonging to a disproportionately small number of individuals. Given that license sales are actually not widely dispersed among copyright owners, Katz argues that there is no reason to suppose that direct transactions between licensees and copyright holders would be impractical.

Until its 2019 abolition, the department provided services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, children and young people, families, people who are homeless, people with a disability, their families and carers, women, and older people. It was formed as a cluster agency from the former Department of Housing, Department of Community Services, and the Department of Ageing, Disability and Home Care. The functions of the department, along with broader responsibilities, were transferred to the newly formed Department of Communities and Justice with effect from 1 July 2019.

It marks the return of the show's theme song, \\"Little Boxes\\". Creator Jenji Kohan revealed that cover versions of the song would be used during the opening credits (as during past seasons) and confirmed that Ben Folds and the Mountain Goats would be featured artists. Kohan also confirmed that the song would be covered in a duet by Steve Martin and series regular Kevin Nealon, who each sang and played the banjo. Series co-star Hunter Parrish also provided a cover version for the season's tenth episode. The final two episodes of the season aired back to back as a one-hour series finale, which was the series' first and only one- hour show in its eight-year run.  Plot  Season eight picks up where season seven ended ‚Äî the family is eating dinner when a concealed sniper targets Nancy through a rifle scope and fires a shot. Nancy, shot in the head, is rushed to the hospital. While she is still unconscious, the shooter, Tim Scottson, son of her late second husband, DEA agent Peter Scottson, visits her. Shane, first a member of the police academy and later an officer, arrests him with his police squad. Nancy's estranged sister Jill sleeps with both Nancy's brother-in-law Andy and Doug. Subsequently, Jill claims to be pregnant but lies and is really going through menopause. Nancy begins working as a representative at a pharmaceutical company which legally produces medical marijuana for people diagnosed with cancer undergoing radiation therapy. Silas also gets a job growing marijuana at the same company as Nancy. After Silas starts working at the pharmaceutical company, he finds himself not too pleased with the process his plants have to go through after they are selected. This leads him to contemplate what marijuana really means to him. After much debate and deliberation, Nancy and Silas realize the industry in which they belong. This realization has them back in Regrestic (formerly Agrestic and Majestic, where the story began). Teaming up with past friends (and enemies) Nancy develops a scheme. The series finale jumps several years into the future and shows how the lives of the characters have progressed. Marijuana was legalized at an unspecified time during the time jump and as a result the Botwins are running several successful marijuana businesses. Per usual, the series gives a slightly dark twist on the present lives of the characters. Nancy regrets her past, but knows there is nothing she can do to change it. Doug on the other hand, wants to reconcile his past mistakes. In the end, the main characters are huddled together, pondering and reflecting, while enjoying the product that has often caused them so much turmoil and yet made them closer and more appreciative of the unique bond they share.

Creator and showrunner Jenji Kohan alongside the other series producers convened for story meetings and were informed early on in the writing process that Showtime Entertainment President David Nevins would not be renewing the show for a ninth season. \\"It did change how we talked about the season so far. We're building toward something different than we might have built toward had we been in the dark,\\" commented Kohan. For the first time since the fourth season, the show featured the Malvina Reynolds song Little Boxes as its theme music, along with a new opening title sequence. The original title sequence was briefly revived in episode 11 with the notable difference of signs reading Regrestic rather than Agrestic and Majestic. Like seasons two and three, different bands and artists were used to cover the song for each episode. Moreover, Julie Anne Robinson, who had not directed an episode since season four, directed two episodes this season. In addition, Perry Lang, who had not directed an episode since season three, directed an episode this season. The season's first episode, \\"Messy\\", was made available online through Showtime's \\"Freeview\\" Facebook page a week before the broadcast premiere. Reception This season earned 60 out of 100 on Metacritic, indicating mixed reviews.

She was a significant figure in New Zealand poetry and theatre between 1910 and 1930, and became a well-known personality in Wellington, with interests in theatre, writing and the arts.  Early life and education  Nicholls was born in Wellington in 1890. She was the youngest daughter of Harry Edgar Nicholls, a Harbour Board Secretary and a prominent actor in the Wellington theatre scene. She was educated first at Clyde Quay School and Terrace School and after at Wellington Girls' College and Victoria University College. She entered Victoria in 1909, where she studied Greek, Latin and French and became involved with the Edwardian Spike group of writers (1902‚Äì15), that included Siegfried Eichelbaum, Seaforth Mackenzie, A. F. T. Chorlton, Hubert Church, Philip Grey, Mary E. Heath (later Mrs Ballantyne), Erica R. Fell (later Mrs Erica R. Wilson), A. E. Caddick and F. A. de la Mare. At Victoria, her interests included The Play Readers' Society in Kelburn and the Women's Debating Society and she edited the student review, The Spike, in 1912. She was Vice-President of the Students' Association in 1912 and 1913. Her father instructed the play readers' group. She also produced two plays for the University Dramatic Society when first it began. An accomplished orator, in 1913, she became the first woman to compete for and win the Plunket Medal for Oratory at Victoria College.  Career  Nicholls left Victoria and travelled abroad to London in 1914, making contacts with the English and European stage. She moved back and forth between her activities at Victoria and further travel overseas visiting a number of countries, including Australia, South Africa, France and India, before returning to Wellington around 1919. In India and Ceylon, she met her future husband. In February 1920, Nicholls married John Hannah, a merchant of Colombo. She moved from Wellington to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) for the wedding. On the death of her husband from enteric fever soon after the wedding, Nicholls returned to Wellington, where her family lived and where she became a well-known personality in the arts scene. She became involved with acting and producing in the repertory theatre, continued to write poetry and did painting. She had earlier studied painting with Miss D. K. Richmond. She also made trips to England, France, North America and India. In England, in 1925, she became a member of the British Drama League and attended summer schools at Oxford and Sussex where drama and poetry were the subject of study. She also studied theatre at the Pasadena Theatre in California and the Greenleaf Theatre in New York. Nicholls produced plays by A. A. Milne, Sir A. P. Herbert, Lady Gregory and other modern playwrights for the National Repertory Society in Wellington and the Victoria University College Dramatic Society. In addition, she worked as a university extension lecturer in drama for the Workers' Educational Association, taught at Wellington Girls' College and Chilton St James School and in teaching elocution. In 1928, Nicholls also gave a lecture on 'The Literature of New Zealand' in the Dominion Farmers' Institute building for the WEA. Her other interests included the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and she was a member of the League of Nations local branch, and also of the International Council of Women. Nicholls was instrumental in reforming the council in New Zealand, and attended meetings of the executive of the council in London in 1929.  Death  Nicholls died in a bus stop accident on 1 October 1930 returning from a concert. An obituary appeared a day after in the Evening Post. It was reported that she was knocked over by a bus turning around in the darkened street that reversed, ran over and crushed her.The Evening Post, 2 October 1930, p. 10. She was 40 years old at the time of her death. The Post obituary wrote: ‚ÄòHer death removes a cultured and charming personality who could ill be spared.‚Äô A large attendance at her funeral on 4 October 1930 indicated the esteem and high regard with which Wellingtonians held her.The Evening Post, 4 October 1930, .p. 11. Further obituaries appeared in Art in New Zealand (March 1931) and in The Spike 1931 by Eileen Duggan. In her will, Nicholls made a bequest of moneys to buy artworks for display in the woman's common room at Victoria College. Her executors commissioned a portrait painting by Mollie Tripe of Marjory. Beryl Hughes notes that the painting hung in the Women's Studies Department at Victoria University of Wellington\\"Archives: A Portrait of Marjory Nicholls\\" by Beryl Hughes and J. Vial in Women's Studies Journal 5.1 (September 1989), 74‚Äì80. but is now in storage. A Marjory Nicholls Speech Contest was also established after her death at Wellington Girls‚Äô College.  Literary output  Nicholls wrote verse from a young school age and published three collections of poetry in her lifetime: A Venture in Verse (1917), Gathered Leaves (1922) and prior to her death, Thirdly (1930). Her poetry is mostly collected in the Victoria University College anthology The Old Clay Patch (1920 and 1949 editions) and The Spike, the Victoria College student review. She also published poems in C. C. Review [Canterbury College Review] and The Reporter and was included in Quentin Pope's 1930 anthology of contemporary New Zealand verse, Kowhai Gold. There is a posthumously published poem in the literary magazine The New Zealand Mercury (Vol. 1, No. 1, 1933) contributed by her father, H. E. Nicholls, and another poem, 'She Clothed Herself in Dreams', appears in The Evening Post (14 March 1936) reproduced by C. A. Marris on popular request for his \\"Postscripts\\" column edited under the pseudonym of Percy Flage. The editor's note in The New Zealand Mercury states that Nicholls' ‚Äòliterary achievement is held in high honour in this Dominion.‚Äô Two poems by Nicholls appear in the 1937 anthology, Here are Verses, edited by Helen Longford. Some of her verse was also published under her married name of Mrs Marjory L. Hannah or the initials 'M.L.N.'. Nicholls' poem 'Over the Kelburn Hill' was republished in Pat Lawlor's Wellington in Verse and Picture (c.1939, 2nd edition 1955). In 1940, G. H. Scholefield wrote an article on Nicholls for the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography. In 2009, Original Books published Complete Poems in two volumes.  Renewal of interest  In the past two decades, there has been renewed interest in Nicholls' verse and life. Beryl Hughes wrote on Nicholls for the Book of New Zealand Women (1991) and the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography, Vol. III (1996). In 2009, New Zealand scholar, poet and publisher Niel Wright edited her Complete Poems (under the authorial name of M. L. Nicholls) in two volumes, with notes published separately that same year. This can be seen as a reappraisal of her place in New Zealand poetry during the Georgian and post-war period (1915‚Äì1930) and a sign of her status as an early feminist writer. Wright also states in her Complete Poems that 'Nicholls was a leading New Zealand poet of the decade 1910‚Äì1920'. She was encouraged by a young J. H. E. Schr√∂der in C. C. Review who later influenced among others Robin Hyde, Ruth Gilbert and Wright himself. Wright later produced a book discussing Schr√∂der and Nicholls' friendship, 'J.H.E. Schroder and the Poetry of E.S. and Marjory Nicholls' in C.C. Review (2010) as well as Further Notes on the Aotearoa Poet Marjory Lydia Nicholls (2011). In 2011, New Zealand poet, critic and editor Mark Pirie wrote on Nicholls' verse on the Tuesday Poem blog and included her poetry in Poetry Notes, the Poetry Archive of New Zealand Aotearoa newsletter, Summer 2011. That same year, a selection of her poems was made by Cameron La Follette for the University of Toronto Libraries' RPO [Representative Poetry Online] website. Michael John O'Leary's PhD thesis, 'Social and Literary Constraints on Women Writers in New Zealand 1945‚Äì70', awarded in 2011 by the Gender and Women's Studies Department at Victoria University of Wellington also discusses the work of Nicholls.

She was one of ten children of Margaret (born Cairns Smith) and David Nicol. Her father was a gardener who prospered in New Zealand. She was a teetotaller and committed Presbyterian. She taught in a Sunday School and her work with the poor exposed her to the ills of alcohol and she became a committed prohibitionist and member of the temperance movement. It was through her association with the New Zealand branch of the Women's Christian Temperance Union that she became involved in the struggle for women's suffrage in New Zealand. She became one of the pioneering leaders of the suffrage movement in Dunedin, which was New Zealand's largest city at the time. Along with Marion Hatton and Harriet Morison, she established the Women's Franchise League; the alcohol lobby in Dunedin was particularly strong, and the three decided that a pro-suffrage organisation outside the temperance movement would be more effective. Through their efforts, Dunedin contributed more signatures to the three pro-suffrage parliamentary petitions than any other part of the country.

Both can be supplied complete or in kit form. The two models differ chiefly in undercarriage type. Design and development Apart from their undercarriage configurations, the XL (tricycle) and Trail (tailwheel) are essentially the same aircraft, with common layout, aerodynamics, dimensions and engine choices. The high wings have constant chord and blunt tips. They are braced to the lower fuselage with a single lift strut on each side. The ailerons are piano hinged, with plain flaps inboard. Fin and rudder are straight edged and swept but the cantilever horizontal surfaces are rectangular; the port elevator carries a trim tab. Both wing and tailplane can be folded back for transport, the wings rotating by 90¬∞ about their axis to lie alongside the fuselage. The wings are made from aluminium. The flat sided fuselage is built around a welded chrome-molybdenum steel frame which is skinned with riveted metal. A composite cowling covers the flat-four engine which may be a Rotax 912UL, Sauer S 2400 UL, Sauer S 2200 UL a Jabiru 2200, Westlake A80 or other engine of similar power, driving a GT two-blade propeller. The cockpit seats two in tandem under the wing, with a transparency built into the leading edge for a better upward view from the front seat. There is a wide, upward hinged, starboard side glazed door for access into both seats. There is a rear-view transparency in the fairing behind the accommodation, over the tapered fuselage.Tacke, Willi; Marino Boric; et al: World Directory of Light Aviation 2015-16, page 58. Flying Pages Europe SARL, 2015. The Trail has a fixed tailwheel undercarriage, with the mainwheels mounted onto the lower fuselage on cantilever aluminium spring legs. Ground steering is by differential hydraulic brakes. Larger wheels are an option for rough ground operation. The XL has similarly sprung mainwheels, though mounted further aft and in fairings. Its nosewheel is also faired. The Trail is derived from the XL and made its first appearance at AERO Friedrichshafen in April 2009, though it is not known if it had then already flown. Operational history 50 Trails had been built by the end of 2010. UK marketing began that year and one aircraft was UK registered in December 2010.
