The bronze seagulls atop the monument. The Seagull Monument is a small monument situated immediately in front of the Salt Lake Assembly Hall on Temple Square, in Salt Lake City, Utah. The Monument commemorates what some members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) call the Miracle of the Gulls. History In 1848 the Mormon pioneers planted crops for their first spring season in Utah. As the crops ripened, Mormon crickets descended upon the farms from the foothills east of the valley. The insects consumed entire fields. According to traditional account, the harvest was saved when the pioneer farmers knelt in prayer, which prayers were answered by flocks of native seagulls which devoured the crickets. This event, popularly called the \\"Miracle of the Gulls\\", is remembered by Latter-day Saints as a miracle. The incident is somewhat controversial in nature with some historians questioning the credibility of the account. To celebrate the role seagulls played in the pioneer's first year in Utah, the LDS Church erected Seagull Monument on their Temple Square in Salt Lake City, Utah. The top of the monument is a bronze statue of two insect-devouring seagulls cast by sculptor Mahonri M. Young, who designed the monument. Young studied in France, and was grandson of LDS leader Brigham Young. The monument was dedicated October 1, 1913, by LDS Church president Joseph F. Smith. The Seagull Monument is believed to be the first monument dedicated to birds. The California gull is now the Utah State bird. In popular culture * The monument is featured in the 1940 film, Brigham Young.

A lawyer by profession, he was first elected as an Ontario New Democratic Party (ONDP) Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the Welland constituency in a 1988 provincial by-election. He replaced veteran NDP legislator Mel Swart. Kormos was re-elected in every subsequent Ontario general election until his retirement from provincial politics in 2011. In 2012, he was elected to Niagara Regional Council in a by-election.\\"Peter Kormos wins Welland byelection \\". Hamilton Spectator, March 27, 2012. Early life and education Peter Eric Kormos had Slovak and Hungarian origins from his father, Michael, and Belgian origins from mother, Simone. Peter was the third of six children: Michael, Elaine, Peter, Nadine, Mark, and Sam. Kormos first attained notoriety in the Welland area while still in high school, while president of his student council. Kormos led a sit-in student strike against local administration practices and students' rights. The week-long strike attracted a small minority of students while classes continued and resulted in Kormos's temporary expulsion. He was later educated at Niagara College, York University and Osgoode Hall in Toronto. Called to the bar in 1980, Kormos then worked as a barrister in the Niagara Region. Provincial politics Kormos was a practicing criminal lawyer, and a local Welland city councillor in 1988, when long-time Welland Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) Mel Swart decided to retire due to health reasons. Swart was a populist ONDP MPP, in a heavily unionized constituency. The constituency had a long history of electing \\"populist\\" politicians, going back to 1951 to Swart's predecessor, Ellis Morningstar. The by-election occurred in the middle of two other major elections at the time: the Canadian General election known as the \\"Free Trade\\" election, and the Welland city council election. Kormos continued the \\"populist\\" approach pioneered by Morningstar and Swart, and won a heated ‚Äì and what the Toronto Star called, \\"[a] vote as dirty as mudwrestling\\" ‚Äì election on November 3, 1988. In government 1990‚Äì1995 The NDP won government under Bob Rae in the general election of 1990, and Kormos was appointed to cabinet as Minister of Consumer and Commercial Relations and Minister of Financial Institutions on October 1, 1990. Notably, he was expected to implement a public auto insurance system, one of the promises of the recent election campaign. Rae had mixed feelings about appointing Kormos to his cabinet. He said in his book, Protest to Power, \\"It was better to have him inside the tent pissing out than outside the tent pissing in. The problem was that he ended up inside the tent pissing in.\\" Once in cabinet Rae described him as \\"an impossible colleague and even more difficult minister. He missed meetings, threw tantrums, and belittled his colleagues in cabinet committee.\\" At the same time Kormos launched a campaign against beer company advertising which he called sexist and exploitative. Somewhat inconsistently, he elicited controversy by appearing, fully clothed, as a \\"Sunshine Boy\\" model in the Toronto Sun tabloid. This was anathema to some in the party, because of the Sun's politically conservative position and because of the Sunshine Boy's place as a parallel to the \\"Sunshine Girl\\" franchise, pictures of scantily- clothed women given considerably more prominence than the Sunshine Boy. Due to the situation, Rae fired Kormos from cabinet on March 18, 1991, after he refused to resign. Rae handed the auto insurance file to Brian Charlton but after considerable discussion, the party backed away from this goal, against considerable opposition from the outspoken Kormos and other party members, including Swart and Kormos' supporter and fellow MPP Mark Morrow. For the remainder of Rae's term in office, Kormos acted as an unofficial \\"left opposition\\" within the NDP caucus, together with Morrow and, until his resignation, Anglican priest Dennis Drainville. In 1993, this group and former cabinet minister Karen Haslam were the only NDP MPPs to vote against the Rae government's Social Contract legislation. The NDP were defeated in the 1995 provincial election, though Kormos's personal popularity was such that he was re-elected without difficulty. In opposition 1995‚Äì2011 After Rae's retirement, Kormos sought the leadership of the Ontario NDP at the convention held on June 22, 1996. He placed third, behind Frances Lankin and Howard Hampton. He played a 'dark horse' role by attacking Lankin over her support of the Social Contract. Even though he released his delegates after he lost on the third ballot, his behaviour during the convention was a significant factor in Hampton's victory. In 1996, Kormos was charged with assaulting a security guard at the Family Support Services office in North York, Ontario. Kormos challenged the charges on the basis that the prosecution amounted to an abuse of the court‚Äôs process by the Attorney General, but his challenge was dismissed by the court. However, when the case came to trial, the judge dismissed the charges writing that there was only \\"some incidental contact by Mr. Kormos in order to divert Mr. Subedar's attention away from [a] cameraman's efforts to film the offices.\\" He was widely expected to contest the leadership in 2009, following Hampton's retirement, but instead supported the successful candidacy of Andrea Horwath. Kormos served as House Leader for the Ontario NDP Caucus from 2001 until his retirement in 2011 and also held numerous critic portfolios in Opposition, including Justice, Community Safety and Correctional Services, Consumer and Business Services, Labour, and Democratic Renewal. On June 3, 2011, Kormos announced that he was retiring after 23 years in the legislature. In 2005, the Big Brothers Big Sisters of Canada honoured several Ontario MPPs whose support of mentoring programs in their ridings have made a great difference in the organization's ability to provide one-on-one mentoring to children and youth. Peter Kormos was one of them. Niagara Regional Council Kormos was elected to Niagara Regional Council in a municipal by-election on March 26, 2012, filling the seat vacated by Cindy Forster when she won election to succeed Kormos in the Legislative Assembly. He remained a member of the law firm Kormos and Evans. Kormos was an active member of the council until his death, taking part in arrangements for a public meeting, to be held in March 2013 to discuss whether Niagara's municipal governments should be amalgamated into a regional government. Death Peter Kormos had some health problems in the years approaching his death. In 2011, he was absent from the legislature for several months just before the provincial election and he chose not to run again for MPP. He collapsed in Toronto on Wednesday, March 27, 2013, and was taken to hospital. However, he checked himself out and returned to Welland. Kormos died on the morning of March 30, 2013 at his Welland, Ontario home.

Kormos' memorial, held in several rooms of a funeral home, attracted hundreds of attendees, including Ontario Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne and Conservative senator Bob Runciman. He was lauded by NDP leader Andrea Horwath for being a heretic in his own party. Views Kormos represented socialist economic values with a populist, working-class presentation and genuine passion. He was notable for showing up in the provincial legislature in open- neck shirt and cowboy boots, which he stated were made locally under fair working conditions. He opposed the Third Way movement made famous by British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Biographical book In July 2014, Brock University Professor Larry Savage published a biography of Kormos entitled Socialist Cowboy: The Politics of Peter Kormos.

It was formed in 1993 by the merger of The Queen's College, Glasgow (founded in 1875) and Glasgow Polytechnic (founded in 1971). In June 2017, the university's New York partner institution, which was founded in 2013, was granted permission to award degrees in the state, the first higher education institution founded by a foreign university to achieve this status. History The University traces its origin from The Queen's College, Glasgow (founded 1875) and the Glasgow College of Technology (founded 1971). The Queen's College, which specialised in providing training in domestic science, received the Royal accolade of being named after Queen Elizabeth in its centenary celebrations in 1975. Queen Elizabeth was, herself, Patron of the College since 1944. Glasgow Polytechnic, which was one of the largest central institutions in Scotland, offered externally validated degrees and diplomas in engineering, science, and the humanities: the first of which was a BA in Optics, followed by degrees in Social Sciences (1973) and Nursing (1977). On 1 April 1993, the two institutions amalgamated to form Glasgow Caledonian University. The new university took its name from Caledonia, the poetic Latin name for present-day Scotland. The main campus of the university is built on the site of the former Buchanan Street Station, built by the Caledonian Railway. Independent research carried out in 2015 revealed that the University contributes over ¬£480m to Scotland's economy each year with the quantifiable lifetime premium of a one- year class of graduates estimated at around ¬£400m, bringing the University's total annual economic impact to around ¬£880m in Scotland alone. Annie Lennox was installed as GCU's first female chancellor, taking over the role from Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, at a ceremony in July 2018. Pamela Gillies is the Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the University, appointed in 2006. Coat of arms and motto The University's coat of arms is the work of university academic and artist Malcolm Lochhead and draws on four elements from the coat of arms of the University's predecessor institutions. The Caledonian Oak Tree (of St. Mungo's infamous legend) and the Book of Knowledge were borrowed from the arms of Glasgow Polytechnic while the Saltire Ermine and the Crossed Keys (intended to represent the \\"unlocking\\" of the Book of Knowledge) were taken from the arms of The Queen's College. A visual feature was added to the new arms with the illuminated capital letters in the Book's paragraphs reading: G C U (the three-letter abbreviation of the University's name). The Coat of Arms was matriculated by the Lord Lyon King of Arms and is inscribed into university degree parchments. The University's motto: \\"for the common weal\\", which has been adopted since 1975, features in the full design of the arms. Campuses The University's Glasgow campus at dusk GCU's main campus is in Glasgow city-centre. A second campus in London is home to the British School of Fashion. In September 2013 the university founded Glasgow Caledonian New York College, which is an independent partner institution whose Wooster Street campus is based in the city's SoHo district.

Established as a social business in 2010, GCCN is raising healthcare education provision to an international standard and transforming the lives of young women across Bangladesh and the health and wellbeing of the population they serve. South Africa The University has a history of interaction with South Africa and a number of its leading figures. It was the first university to award Nelson Mandela an honorary doctorate upon his release from prison in 1990 in recognition of his leadership during the anti-apartheid movement. In accepting the honour, Mandela asked the University to offer support for reconstruction and development in South Africa and the University developed in this regard several projects to assist in research and training at a number of South African universities. Mandela officially received the honorary degree in June 1996 at a special ceremony in Buckingham Palace, and suggested the renaming of the University's Health Building after his close associate, Govan Mbeki, who was imprisoned in the cell next to him on Robben Island. The Govan Mbeki Building was officially inaugurated by Mbeki's son, President Thabo Mbeki, in June 2001 and a specially-commissioned portrait of Nelson Mandela was unveiled that year at the Building's foyer by Mandela's wife, Gra√ßa Machel. The University is also home to two significant scholarly collections on South Africa: the Anti-Apartheid Movement in Scotland Archive and the George Johannes Collection. In 2012, GCU began designing and developing work- based programmes in railway operations management for Transnet Freight Rail, South Africa's largest freight rail organisation. Cultural Fellows The Caledonian Cultural Fellows Initiative was set up in 2009 with the aim of enhancing university cultural life and promoting cultural engagement with wider community. Liz Lochhead, the Scots Makar, is the current Honorary President of the Fellowship, whose membership includes writer Anne Donovan, poet and novellist Jackie Kay, and artist Toby Paterson. Caledonian Club The Caledonian Club is a social and community engagement initiative involving staff and students coaching young people and their families in advancing their learning and life skills, while university-based researchers carry out long- term analysis into the process as part of a wider university research agenda into life-long learning. In 2011, the Club developed a project named 'The Tale of Two Sporting Cities', with the aim of engaging cultural exchanges between primary schools in Glasgow and London and assessing the sporting and cultural legacy of the 2012 London Summer Olympics and the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games. Student life Students' Association Glasgow Caledonian University Students' Association (GCUSA) is the students' association of Glasgow Caledonian University. It represents and enables Glasgow Caledonian University students to enhance all aspects of their student experience. It is located in the Students' Association Building on the Glasgow Campus and has an office at GCU London. All Glasgow Caledonian University students are automatically admitted to its membership upon matriculation. In 2011, the Association was awarded the coveted title of Students' Union of the Year by NUS Scotland. The Students' Association runs sports clubs, societies, student magazine (The EDIT), radio station (Radio Caley), active lifestyles programme and an events programme. At a national level the Students' Association is affiliated to the National Union of Students (NUS) which lobbies and campaigns for students at a Scottish and UK level. Graduation Bedellus carrying the University's Ceremonial Mace GCU holds its annual graduation ceremonies during the summer and autumn and its academic attire is made by robe-maker Ede & Ravenscroft. Under the University's academic dress code, the wearing of the customary mortar boards is disallowed, as it is not part of the official academic attire that consists of gowns and hoods only, individual to each award conferred. Graduants traditionally receive their degrees at graduation ceremonies by being \\"capped\\" on the head with the Chancellor's hat, in a gesture that signifies the Chancellor's authority and status within the University.

He was a proponent of the mapping of the human genome due to its use for studying congenital diseases. He is well known for his studies of the Amish. He was the original author and, until his death, remained chief editor of Mendelian Inheritance in Man (MIM) and its online counterpart Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM). He is widely known as the \\"father of medical genetics\\".  Personal life  Victor and his identical twin Vincent L. McKusick were born on October 21, 1921. Victor was one of five children. His father was a graduate of Bates College. Before deciding to work as a dairy farmer, Victor's father served as a high school principal in Chester, Vermont. Victor's mother had been an elementary school teacher before marrying. Victor and his siblings were raised on a dairy farm in Parkman, Maine. During the summer of 1937, Victor suffered a severe microaerophilic Streptococcus infection in his axilla. As a result, Victor spent time in two hospitals, one of which was Massachusetts General Hospital. He finally saw a successful diagnosis and course of treatment, using sulfanilamide during his ten weeks at Massachusetts General. Since none of his close family were doctors, the events of 1937 represented McKusick's first substantial experience with the medical community. He stated, \\"Perhaps I would have ended up a lawyer if it weren't for the microaerophilic streptococcus.\\" Victor married Anne Bishop McKusick in 1949. Anne served Johns Hopkins Hospital as Associate Professor of Medicine in the Division of Rheumatology. The couple had two sons, Victor and Kenneth, and a daughter, Carol.  Medical career   Education  After high school, Victor chose to study at Tufts University, and studied there for six semesters from the fall of 1940 to the summer of 1942. Although Tufts had an associated medical school, Victor was fascinated by Johns Hopkins and by its dedication to medical research, and chose to attend Hopkins Medical School instead. The history and research environment of Hopkins excited McKusick, and during World War II The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine could not fill its classes. Therefore, the school temporarily discontinued requiring a baccalaureate degree as for admission for the first time since the school's founding in 1893. Victor applied during his sixth semester at Tufts, and began in the fall of 1942, as one of the first, of very few, who ever entered the school without a bachelor's degree. Victor never earned a baccalaureate degree, although he has been awarded over 20 honorary degrees.Luminaries, M ‚Äì Z. Tufts Alumni. Retrieved on May 9, 2016. He earned his Doctor of Medicine through an accelerated program in only three years. He was offered the prestigious William Osler Internship in Internal Medicine at Johns Hopkins Hospital, and chose to remain at Hopkins for his residency.The Victor A. McKusick Papers: Biographical Information. Profiles.nlm.nih.gov. Retrieved on May 9, 2016. He completed his residency training as a cardiologist, since the department of genetics did not exist at the time. McKusick specialized in heart murmurs, and utilized spectroscopy to analyze heart sounds.  Work at Hopkins  In 1956 McKusick traveled to Copenhagen to speak about the heritable disorders of connective tissue at the first international congress of human genetics. The meeting looms as the birthplace of the medical genetics field. In the following decades, McKusick went on to head the Chronic Disease Clinic and created and chaired a new Division of Medical Genetics at Hopkins beginning in 1957. In 1973, he served as Physician-in-Chief, William Osler Professor of Medicine, and Chairman of the Department of Medicine at Johns Hopkins Hospital and School of Medicine. McKusick resigned the appointments in 1985, but continued to teach, conduct research, and practice medicine in the Departments of Medicine and Medical Genetics. He held concurrent appointments as University Professor of Medical Genetics at the McKusick‚ÄìNathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, Professor of Medicine at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Professor of Epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and Professor of Biology at Johns Hopkins University. McKusick played a role in the development of the HeLa cell line that has been instrumental in biomedical research, but he also treated the Lacks family poorly and misled them about subsequent blood draws for research purposes. He held numerous faculty appointments while remaining at Johns Hopkins until his death in 2008.  Organizations  In 1960, McKusick founded and co-directed the Annual Short Course in Medical and Experimental Mammalian Genetics at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine. He published Mendelian Inheritance in Man (MIM), which was the first published catalog of all known genes and genetic disorders, in 1966. The complete text of MIM was made available online free of charge beginning in 1987, and titled Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM). The 12th and final print edition was published in 1998. The online database is continually updated, and linked with the National Center for Biotechnology Information. OMIM is distributed through the National Library of Medicine, and has been a part of the Entrez database network system since 1995. At the time of McKusick's death, OMIM contained 18,847 entries. He also led the Annual Course in Medical Genetics at the University of Bologna Residential Center in Bertinoro di Romagna, Italy in 1987. McKusick was founding president of the Human Genome Organization in 1989.  Publications and research  McKusick wrote extensively on the history of medicine, genetics, medical genetics, and about Parkman, Maine. He co-founded Genomics in 1987 with Dr. Frank Ruddle, and served as an editor. He led a Congressionally-chartered committee examining the ethics of testing Abraham Lincoln's tissue for the presence of Marfan syndrome genes. His well-known published articles include: * Probable Assignment of the Duffy Blood Group Locus to Chromosome 1 in Man (1968) *The Anatomy of the Human Genome: a Neo- Vesalian Basis for Medicine in the 21st Century (2001) * \\"On lumpers and splitters, or the nosology of genetic disease.\\" In a 2005 paper presented by M.I. Poling, McKusick said: > I have always told my students, residents, and fellows, if you want to > really get on top of some topic, you need to know how it got from where it > was to how it is now.

Victor McKusick taking a picture of an Amish child's hands during his study of the Amish.  Study of genes among the Amish  McKusick's study of genetics among the Amish is perhaps his most famous research. On his first trip to Amish homes, he was accompanied by Dr. David Krusen who had an extensive medical practice among the Amish in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. McKusick spoke about his introduction to Krusen's work, stating, \\"He [Krusen] indicated to the author of the article‚Äîin a slick-paper, pharma-ceutical company 'throw- away'‚Äîthat achondroplasia is frequent among the Amish. Initial study led to the identification of two recessive conditions named Ellis-van Creveldsyndrome syndrome and cartilage-hair hypoplasia (later named metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, McKusick type). McKusick listed fifteen advantages to studying genetics among the Amish. Today, these fifteen reasons are argued to be true as well. McKusick's findings led many other researchers to study hereditary related diseases in the 1960s and 1970s. Other researchers and McKusick cite the Amish as working cooperatively with researchers to determine the reason for inherited diseases. McKusick published his official findings from working with the Amish in 1978, titled Medical Genetic Studies of the Amish.  Awards and honors  McKusick received more than 20 honorary degrees throughout and after his career.

According to the particular discipline, the term \\"power\\" may refer to electrical or mechanical power. A power rating can also involve average and maximum power, which may vary depending on the kind of equipment and its application. Power rating limits are usually set as a guideline by the manufacturers, protecting the equipment and simplifying the design of larger systems, by providing a level of operation under which the equipment will not be damaged while allowing for a certain safety margin.  Equipment types   Dissipative equipment  In equipment which primarily dissipate electric power or convert it into mechanical power, such as resistors, and speakers, the power rating given is usually the maximum power that can be safely dissipated by the equipment. The usual reason for this limit is heat, although in certain electromechanical devices, particularly speakers, it is to prevent mechanical damage. When heat is the limiting factor, the power rating is easily calculated. First, the amount of heat that can be safely dissipated by the device, P_{D,max}, must be calculated. This is related to the maximum safe operating temperature, the ambient temperature or temperature range in which the device will be operated, and the method of cooling. If T_{D,max} is the maximum safe operating temperature of the device, T_{A} is the ambient temperature, and \\\\theta_{DA} is the total thermal resistance between the device and ambient, then the maximum heat dissipation is given by :P_{D,max} = \\\\frac{T_{D,max} - T_{A}}{\\\\theta_{DA}} If all power in a device is dissipated as heat, then this is also the power rating.  Mechanical equipment  Equipment is generally rated by the power they will deliver, for example, at the shaft of an electric or hydraulic motor. The power input to the equipment will be greater owing to the less than 100% efficiency of the device. Efficiency of a device is often defined as the ratio of output power to the sum of output power and losses. In some types of equipment it is possible to measure or calculate losses directly. This allows efficiency to be calculated with greater precision than the quotient of input power over output power, where relatively small measurement uncertainty will greatly affect the resulting calculated efficiency.  Power converting equipment In devices that primarily convert between different forms of electric power, such as transformers, or transport it from one location to another, such as transmission lines, the power rating almost always refers to the maximum power flow through the device, not dissipation within it. The usual reason for the limit is heat, and the maximum heat dissipation is calculated as above. Power ratings are usually given in watts for real power and volt-amperes for apparent power, although for devices intended for use in large power systems, both may be given in a per-unit system. Cables are usually rated by giving their maximum voltage and their ampacity. As the power rating depends on the method of cooling, different ratings may be specified for air cooling, water cooling, etc.  Average vs. maximum  For AC-operated devices (e.g. coaxial cable, loudspeakers), there may even be two power ratings, a maximum (peak) power rating and an average power rating. For such devices, the peak power rating usually specifies the low frequency or pulse energy, while the average power rating limits high-frequency operation. Average power calculation rating depends on some assumptions how the device is going to be used. For example, the EIA rating method for loudspeakers uses a shaped noise signal that simulates music and allows peak excursion of 6 dB, so an EIA rating of 50 Watts corresponds to 200 Watts peak rating.  Maximum continuous rating  Maximum continuous rating (MCR) is defined as the maximum output (MW) that an electric power generating station is capable of producing continuously under normal conditions over a year. Under ideal conditions, the actual output could be higher than the MCR. Within shipping, ships usually operates at the nominal continuous rating (NCR) which is 85% of the 90% of MCR. The 90% MCR is usually the contractual output for which the propeller is designed. Thus, the usual output at which ships are operated is around 75% to 77% of MCR.Danish proposal to a design CO2 index for new ships to the UN‚Äôs International Maritime Organization (IMO) from the Danish Maritime Authority  Other definitions  In some fields of engineering, even a more complex set of power ratings is used. For example, helicopter engines are rated for continuous power (which does not have a time constraint), takeoff and hover power rating (defined as half to one hour operation), maximum contingency power (which can be sustained for two-three minutes), and emergency (half a minute) power rating. For electrical motors, a similar kind of information is conveyed by the service factor, which is a multiplier that, when applied to the rated output power, gives the power level a motor can sustain for shorter periods of time. The service factor is typically in the 1.15-1.4 range, with the figure being lower for higher-power motors. For every hour of operation at the service-factor- adjusted power rating, a motor loses two to three hours of life at nominal power, i.e. its service life is reduced to less than half for continued operation at this level. The service factor is defined in the ANSI/NEMA MG 1 standard, and is generally used in the United States. There is no IEC standard for the service factor. Exceeding the power rating of a device by more than the margin of safety set by the manufacturer usually does damage to the device by causing its operating temperature to exceed safe levels. In semiconductors, irreparable damage can occur very quickly. Exceeding the power rating of most devices for a very short period of time is not harmful, although doing so regularly can sometimes cause cumulative damage. Power ratings for electrical apparatus and transmission lines are a function of the duration of the proposed load and the ambient temperature; a transmission line or transformer, for example, can carry significantly more load in cold weather than in hot weather. Momentary overloads, causing high temperatures and deterioration of insulation, may be considered an acceptable trade-off in emergency situations. The power rating of switching devices varies depending on the circuit voltage as well as the current. In certain aerospace or military applications, a device may carry a much higher rating than would be accepted in devices intended to operate for long service life.  Examples   Audio amplifiers  Audio amplifier power ratings are typically established by driving the device under test to the onset of clipping, to a predetermined distortion level, variable per manufacturer or per product line. Driving an amplifier to 1% distortion levels will yield a higher rating than driving it to 0.01% distortion levels.Quilter, Patrick (2004). \\"How to Compare Amplifier Power Ratings.\\" Sound and Song. Retrieveded on March 18, 2010. Similarly, testing an amplifier at a single mid-range frequency, or testing just one channel of a two-channel amplifier, will yield a higher rating than if it is tested throughout its intended frequency range with both channels working. Manufacturers can use these methods to market amplifiers whose published maximum power output includes some amount of clipping in order to show higher numbers. For instance, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) established an amplifier rating system in which the device is tested with both channels driven throughout its advertised frequency range, at no more than its published distortion level. The Electronic Industries Association (EIA) rating system, however, determines amplifier power by measuring a single channel at 1,000 Hz, with a 1% distortion level‚Äî1% clipping. Using the EIA method rates an amplifier 10 to 20% higher than the FTC method.  Photovoltaic modules  The nominal power of a photovoltaic module is determined by measuring current and voltage while varying resistance under defined illumination. The conditions are specified in standards such as IEC 61215, IEC 61646 and UL 1703; specifically, the light intensity is 1000 W/m2, with a spectrum similar to sunlight hitting the earth's surface at latitude 35¬∞ N in the summer (airmass 1.5) and temperature of the cells at 25 ¬∞C. The power is measured while varying the resistive load on the module between open and closed circuit. The maximum power measured is the nominal power of the module in Watts. Colloquially, this is also written as \\"Wp\\"; this format is colloquial as it is outside the standard by adding suffixes to standardized units. The nominal power divided by the light power that falls on the module (area x 1000 W/m2) is the efficiency.

Scree is a collection of broken rock fragments at the base of crags, mountain cliffs, volcanoes or valley shoulders that has accumulated through periodic rockfall from adjacent cliff faces. Landforms associated with these materials are often called talus deposits. Talus deposits typically have a concave upwards form, while the maximum inclination corresponds to the angle of repose of the mean debris size. The term scree comes from the Old Norse term for landslide, skri√∞a, while the term talus is a French word meaning a slope or embankment.  Formation  Isfjord, Svalbard, Norway. Formation of scree or talus deposits is the result of physical and chemical weathering and erosion acting on a rock face. The predominant processes that degrade a rock slope depend largely on the regional climate (temperature, amount of rainfall, etc.). Examples are: * Biotic processes * Chemical weathering by mineral hydration, dissolution, and salt deposition * Physical weathering by ice * Thermal stresses * Topographic stresses Scree formation is commonly attributed to the formation of ice within mountain rock slopes. During the day, water can flow into joints and discontinuities in the rock wall. If the temperature drops enough, for example in the evening, this water may freeze. Since water expands by 9% when it freezes, it can generate large forces that either create new cracks or wedge blocks into an unstable position. Special boundary conditions (rapid freezing and water confinement) may be required for this to happen. Freeze-thaw scree production is thought to be most common during the spring and fall, when the daily temperatures fluctuate around the freezing point of water, and snow melt produces ample free water. The efficiency of freeze/thaw processes in scree production is debated by scientists. Many researchers believe that ice formation in large open crack systems cannot generate high pressures, and instead suggest that the water and ice simply flow out of the cracks as pressure builds. Many argue that frost heaving, like that known to act in soil in permafrost areas, may play an important role in cliff degradation in cold places. Scree-covered glacier, Lech dl Dragon, Italy Scree can conceal a glacier. For example, Lech dl Dragon, in the Sella group of the Dolomites, derives from the melting waters of a glacier, hidden under a thick layer of scree. The melting process of the underlying glacier is slowed by the protective layer of scree. Eventually, a rock slope may be completely covered by its own scree, so that production of new material ceases. The slope is then said to be \\"mantled\\" with debris.

Napier Technical College, the predecessor of the university, was founded in 1964, taking its name from 16th-century Scottish mathematician and philosopher John Napier. The technical college was inaugurated as a University in 1992 by Lord Douglas-Hamilton, becoming Napier University. In 2009 the University was renamed Edinburgh Napier University. The university is based around its three main Edinburgh campuses: Merchiston, Craiglockhart and Sighthill. It has over 19,500 students, including those on-campus in Scotland and others studying on transnational programmes abroad and online. In 2018 this included nearly 9,500 international and EU students, from more than 140 nations worldwide. History Napier Technical College was founded in 1964, taking its name from John Napier, who was born in 1550 in the medieval tower house of Merchiston Castle (the site of the University's Merchiston campus). His statue stands in the tower of Merchiston Castle today. An opening ceremony was held on 23 February 1965. In 1966, it was renamed Napier College of Science and Technology. In 1974, it merged with the Sighthill-based Edinburgh College of Commerce to form Napier College of Commerce and Technology, which became a Central Institution in 1985. The college was renamed Napier Polytechnic in 1986 and in the same year acquired the former Hydropathic hospital buildings at Craiglockhart. In June 1992 the institution officially became Napier University. At a ceremony witnessed by over 700 staff and students, Lord James Douglas Hamilton and the then Principal, William Turmeau, unveiled the new University sign at Merchiston. In 1994, Napier University acquired its Craighouse Campus. In 1996, the university gained a new Faculty of Health Studies through a merger between the Scottish Borders College of Nursing and Lothian College of Health Studies. In February 2009 it became Edinburgh Napier University Edinburgh Napier has been awarded the Queen's Anniversary Prize twice. Its most recent win came in 2015, when it was recognised for its work in timber engineering, sustainable construction and wood science. Edinburgh Napier was previously awarded the Queen's Anniversary Prize in 2009 when the award was made for 'Innovative housing construction for environmental benefit and quality of life'. This recognised the contribution made by the University's Building Performance Centre towards improving sound insulation between attached dwellings. The motto of the University, Nisi sapientia frustra (meaning \\"Without knowledge, [all is] in vain\\"), echoes the motto of the City of Edinburgh, Nisi Dominus frustra (meaning \\"Without [the] Lord, [all is] in vain\\"). Edinburgh Napier's Tartan was launched at the same time as the name change in February 2009. Previously the university used the Clan Napier Tartan; the Chief of Clan Napier welcomed the new University tartan. Campuses The university is based around its three main campuses at Merchiston, Craiglockhart and Sighthill. Sighthill Campus  Exterior of Edinburgh Napier University's Sighthill Campus The Sighthill Campus opened to students in the School of Health & Social Care and School of Applied Sciences in January 2011.

Located to the north of the larger Viti Levu, the island has an area of and a population of 135,961 .  Geology  Fiji lies in a tectonically complex area between the Australian Plate and the Pacific Plate. The Fiji Platform lies in a zone bordered with active extension fault lines around which most of the shallow earthquakes were centered. These fault lines are the Fiji Fracture Zone (FFZ) to the north, the 176¬∞ Extension Zone (176¬∞E EZ) to the west, and the Hunter Fracture Zone (HFZ) and Lau Ridge to the east. Mio-Pliocene sandstones and marl grade into epiclastics and andesitic volcanics of the Suva Group. The Group forms the Korotini Tableland in the middle of the island, it includes the peaks of Seseleka (), Ndelanathau (), Nararo (), Valili (), Mariko (), Mount Nasorolevu (), Ndikeva (), and Uluingala (). The Pliocene Undu Group in the northeastern portion of the island, consists of breccia, tuff, and flows of rhyolite and dacite overlain by pumiceous strata. The Plio-Pleistocene Mba Grouop is found on the southwestern portion of the island and consists of porphyritic basalt flows and volcanoclastics grading into greywacke. The Group includes the peak of Navotuvotu () and the Mt. Kasi Mine.  Geography  Island of Vanua Levu The main part of the island is roughly shaped like a tall, thin triangle in width and in length, rotated so that the point is to the northeast. This point, the northernmost in the Fiji chain, is Udu Point. From the southeastern side of this triangle, a long peninsula stretches out into the Koro Sea. The island is rough and hilly, and is surrounded by coral reefs, including Cakaulevu Reef, a long barrier reef off the northern shore. The antimeridian passes through this island. A rugged mountain range divides the island horizontally, forming much of the boundary between the Provinces of Cakaudrove and Macuata. The highest peaks are Mount Batini, also known as Nasorolevu, with an altitude of , and, further north-east, Dikeva, also known as Mount Thurston, with an altitude of . Vanua Levu's main mountain ranges lie near the windward, southern coasts, making them much wetter. Northern Vanua Levu, by contrast, has a dry climate eight months of the year, enabling sugar cane, the island's major crop, to thrive there. Vanua Levu has a number of rivers, including the Labasa, the Wailevu, and the Qawa. These three form a delta on which the town of Labasa stands. None of the island's rivers are navigable by large vessels. There are also many well known rivers on Vanua levu. The first is the most dangerous river, the Wainikoro river, known for its shark attacks. The second is the Dreketi river, the deepest river in Fiji.  Flora and fauna  A area covering much of the interior of the Natewa/Tunuloa peninsula is the Natewa/Tunuloa Peninsula Important Bird Area. The Important Bird Area covers the largest tracts of remaining old growth forest on the peninsula, which is on the south of Vanua Levu, and it supports a population of vulnerable Shy Ground-dove.  Demographics and economic activities  Ferry and bus at the port of Nabouwalu The island's main population centres are the towns of Labasa, in the north, and Savusavu, located at the foot of the peninsula. Labasa, with a population of almost 25,000 at the 1996 census, has a large Indian community, and is a major centre of Fiji's sugar industry. Savusavu is smaller, with a population of just under 5000, but is a popular centre for tourists owing to its diving and yachting facilities. The main industry on the island is sugar cane production, especially in the north. Copra is also an important crop. Tourism is now becoming a major industry on Vanua Levu also.  Politics  For administrative purposes, Vanua Levu is divided into three Provinces: Bua (in the west), Macuata (in the north-east), and Cakaudrove (in the south-east). These three provinces also comprise the Northern Division of Fiji. Together with the remote Lau Islands, Vanua Levu and its outliers form the Tovata Confederacy, one of three traditional alliances of Fiji's chiefs. The Paramount Chief, who is based on the nearby island of Taveuni, holds the title of Tui Cakau. Only two population centres - Labasa and Savusavu - have been incorporated as Towns. Each is governed by a Mayor and a Town Council, whose members are elected for a three-year term and choose the Mayor from among themselves.

Mountains of Vanua-Levu in the distance (June 1853, X, p.67) Vanua Levu was settled about 3,100 years ago, with the settlers living in houses raised above the reefs on the shores. Between 1250 and 1350 the Pacific sea level fell , exposing the tops of the reefs. This killed the abundant sea food, it also dropped the ground water table below the depth of the roots of the crops. The scarcity of food caused conflict and war. In response, the people moved from seaside villages, for mountaintop fortified villages. This forts were occupied until about 1870, with the last clear indication of warfare about 1860. The Dutch navigator Abel Tasman was the first known European to sight Vanua Levu, in 1643. He was followed by Captain William Bligh in 1789, en route to Timor while escaping from the Mutiny on the Bounty, in which his crew had forced him and those loyal to him off deck and cast them adrift in a lifeboat. Captain James Wilson subsequently explored the area in 1797 in his ship Duff. Traders began exploiting sandalwood thickets in the Bua Bay area around 1805, which had been discovered by shipwrecked sailors of the schooner Argo. By 1815, however, the supply had been depleted and apart from the occasional visit from whalers and b√™che-de-mer traders, the island received little further attention until 1840, when a young sailor known as Jackson deserted his crew at Somosomo on the nearby island of Taveuni, was adopted by a local Chief, and explored much of eastern and northern Vanua Levu. Settlers from Australia and New Zealand established coconut plantations in the Savusavu area in the 1860s. Intermarriage with Fijian people produced a mixed-race elite, which also prospered from the sale of copra, of which Savusavu was a major centre, until the Great Depression of the 1930s led to a collapse in the price of copra. In the same period, Indians founded the town of Labasa, now a major sugar-producing centre. In 2012, the nation of Kiribati began negotiating to buy of the island to house its population, which is expected to need to move as their islands are inundated by rising sea levels.

Manufactured by Intamin, it was the sixteenth roller coaster to be built at the park since Blue Streak in 1964. It opened in 2003 as the tallest roller coaster in the world and the first full-circuit roller coaster to exceed in height. Its height record was later surpassed by Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure in 2005. Top Thrill Dragster, along with Kingda Ka, are the only strata coasters in existence. It was the second hydraulically launched roller coaster built by Intamin, following Xcelerator at Knott's Berry Farm. The tagline for Top Thrill Dragster is \\"Race for the Sky\\". History Planning for Top Thrill Dragster began around the time Millennium Force opened in 2000. Concrete footers were poured during the 2001‚Äì2002 offseason and were covered prior to the 2002 operating season to keep them hidden. To construct the roller coaster, the park had to use a crane, one of only four in the United States. Vertical construction by Martin & Vleminckx began in the fall of 2002, months before the announcement. By October 2002, the roller coaster had reached . The ride was announced on January 9, 2003 and the structure, built by Intamin's subcontractor Stakotra,Stakotra was finished shortly after. It is tied with Millennium Force for being the two largest investments in Cedar Point history. The announcement revealed the park's goal to build \\"the tallest and fastest roller coaster on earth\\", reaching and accelerating up to in 4 seconds. On March 10, 2003, Cedar Fair Entertainment Company filed a trademark for the name \\"Top Thrill Dragster\\". Top Thrill Dragster's media day was held on May 1, 2003, and it officially opened to the public several days later on May 4. It became the tallest and fastest roller coaster in the world, overtaking the height record from Steel Dragon 2000 at Nagashima Spa Land, built three years earlier, and the speed record from Dodonpa at Fuji-Q Highland, which opened in late 2001. It lost both records to Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure in May 2005. Intamin designed both Kingda Ka and Top Thrill Dragster, and the two share a similar design and layout that differs primarily by theme and an additional hill featured on Kingda Ka. Shortly after it opened, a faulty valve on the hydraulic system made it nonoperational during the 2003 annual enthusiasts' event, CoasterMania. The ride experienced frequent downtime during the first couple of seasons. Several problems such as continued issues with the hydraulic system and launch cable caused the ride to repeatedly close. For opening weekend 2017, Cedar Point temporarily renamed the ride \\"Top Thrill Cubster\\" after losing a World Series wager to Six Flags Great America.https://www.cleveland.com/tribe/2017/05/cedar_point_makes_good_on_its.html In the 2020 season, following the COVID-19 pandemic, timed boarding passes are in effect named \\"Access Passes\\" to comply with social distancing guidelines. Ride experience Layout After leaving the station, the train enters the launch area. To the left of the launch area is a \\"Christmas tree\\" light, similar to those employed at the starting line of a drag strip. A brief message is played to the riders to: \\"keep arms down, head back, and hold on.\\" Once the train is prepared to launch, a motor revving sound effect is played and its magnetic braking fins are lowered from the launch track. It then launches, accelerating to a speed of in 3.8 seconds. Shortly after reaching its maximum velocity, the catch car disengages, and the train begins its ascent up a 90-degree incline, twisting 90 degrees clockwise before climbing over the top hat. Upon descending, the track twists 270 degrees before leveling out, allowing the train to be stopped by the magnetic brakes. Station, theme, and trains The roller coaster is themed to Top Fuel drag racing, a category of motor racing that involves the world's fastest accelerating cars. An actual Top Fuel dragster weighs approximately one ton, while each train on the coaster weighs 15 tons. Originally, the design called for five cars on each train, but when the ride first opened, there were only four. A fifth car was added to each by midseason. Each dragster-themed train was also decorated with a spoiler, a set of tires, and an engine at the rear of each train, but these were removed after the fifth car was added to allow an extra row of seats to take their place. Rollbacks Occasionally, a train is launched without sufficient speed to reach the top of the tower and rolls back onto the launch track, hence the term \\"rollback\\". This typically happens in cool, wet, or breezy weather, or when the wind is working against it. The launch track is equipped with retractable magnetic braking fins which are raised after each launch in order to slow the train down in case it does not reach the top of the tower. On very rare occasions, a combination of the weight distribution of the train, the force of the launch, and the wind can stall a train on the top of the tower. When this happens, a mechanic takes the elevator to the top and pushes the train down the hill. World records Side view of Top Thrill Dragster When Top Thrill Dragster debuted, it set four new records: * World's tallest complete circuit roller coaster * World's tallest roller coaster * World's tallest roller coaster drop * World's fastest roller coaster It became the fastest roller coaster in the world with a maximum speed of . It was the fourth roller coaster to exceed , preceded by Tower of Terror II at Dreamworld, Superman: Escape from Krypton at Six Flags Magic Mountain and Dodonpa at Fuji-Q Highland. Dodonpa held the record previously with a top speed of . Top Thrill Dragster also broke the height record, standing at , which was previously held by Superman: Escape from Krypton at . Kingda Ka opened two years later at Six Flags Great Adventure and broke both of Top Thrill Dragster's records, boasting a height of and a top speed of . The speed record was again broken in 2010 by Formula Rossa at Ferrari World, which reaches a maximum speed of . , Top Thrill Dragster has the second tallest height, the third fastest speed, and the second-highest drop among steel roller coasters in the world. Incidents On July 14, 2004, four people were struck by flying debris while riding the coaster. Reports indicated that a metal cable frayed during launch, shearing off shards of metal that struck the riders. The injuries were mainly arm abrasions, with one passenger experiencing cuts to the face. They were treated at the park's first aid station, and two later sought further medical attention. On August 7, 2016, two people were treated for minor injuries when the launch cable detached from the ride. The ride was closed for the following day while the park and Ohio state officials investigated the incident. In September 2017, a report with photos surfaced that the braking system on the launch side of the track may have been damaged, causing the ride to close indefinitely. Cedar Point did not acknowledge the incident and stated the closure was for maintenance reasons. In August 2019, the ride was closed for almost 3 weeks due to problems with the launch motor. It opened back to the public on Saturday, August 24.

The X-Files is an American science fiction‚Äìsupernatural television series that originally aired on the Fox network for 9 seasons from September 10, 1993, to May 19, 2002. The series centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder, an FBI profiler, is a believer in the paranormal, and the skeptical Scully, a medical doctor, is assigned to make scientific analyses of Mulder's discoveries which could ultimately be used to discredit his work. Throughout the series the two develop a close friendship. During the eighth and ninth seasons of the series, Duchovny's role was reduced from lead actor to an intermittent lead role. The show's premise originated with Chris Carter, who served as an executive producer along with R. W. Goodwin, Frank Spotnitz, Howard Gordon, Vince Gilligan, John Shiban, Kim Manners, Glen Morgan, James Wong, and many others. Filming for seasons one to five took place primarily in Vancouver, British Columbia, and for the remaining seasons in Los Angeles. Episodes were broadcast on Fridays at 9:00 pm Eastern Time for the series' first three seasons; the remaining six seasons aired on Sundays at 9:00 pm Eastern Time. Episodes are approximately 45 minutes in length (not including commercials) and were broadcast in standard definition. Two feature films based on the television series have been released as part of The X-Files franchise: the first premiered in summer 1998, between seasons five and six of the series, and a post-series film, The X-Files: I Want to Believe, was released in 2008. On March 24, 2015, Fox officially announced the series would return for a six-episode tenth season, which aired in 2016. On April 20, 2017, Fox officially announced The X-Files would be returning for an eleventh season of ten episodes, which premiered on January 3, 2018. Many mythology collections of The X-Files episodes have been released on DVD. Since 2000, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment has distributed all seasons on DVD, and episodes are also available for download at the iTunes Store and Amazon Video, and are available for streaming on Hulu. The show's episodes have won a number of awards, including three Golden Globe Awards for Best Drama Series and a Satellite Award for Best Drama Series.

The operators may be presented abstractly by their characteristics, such as bounded linear operators or closed operators, and consideration may be given to nonlinear operators. The study, which depends heavily on the topology of function spaces, is a branch of functional analysis. If a collection of operators forms an algebra over a field, then it is an operator algebra. The description of operator algebras is part of operator theory. Single operator theory Single operator theory deals with the properties and classification of operators, considered one at a time. For example, the classification of normal operators in terms of their spectra falls into this category. Spectrum of operators The spectral theorem is any of a number of results about linear operators or about matrices.Sunder, V.S. Functional Analysis: Spectral Theory (1997) Birkh√§user Verlag In broad terms the spectral theorem provides conditions under which an operator or a matrix can be diagonalized (that is, represented as a diagonal matrix in some basis). This concept of diagonalization is relatively straightforward for operators on finite- dimensional spaces, but requires some modification for operators on infinite- dimensional spaces. In general, the spectral theorem identifies a class of linear operators that can be modelled by multiplication operators, which are as simple as one can hope to find. In more abstract language, the spectral theorem is a statement about commutative C*-algebras. See also spectral theory for a historical perspective. Examples of operators to which the spectral theorem applies are self-adjoint operators or more generally normal operators on Hilbert spaces. The spectral theorem also provides a canonical decomposition, called the spectral decomposition, eigenvalue decomposition, or eigendecomposition, of the underlying vector space on which the operator acts. =Normal operators= A normal operator on a complex Hilbert space H is a continuous linear operator N : H ‚Üí H that commutes with its hermitian adjoint N*, that is: NN* = N*N. Normal operators are important because the spectral theorem holds for them. Today, the class of normal operators is well understood. Examples of normal operators are * unitary operators: N* = N‚àí1 * Hermitian operators (i.e., selfadjoint operators): N* = N; (also, anti- selfadjoint operators: N* = ‚àíN) * positive operators: N = MMnormal matrices can be seen as normal operators if one takes the Hilbert space to be Cn. The spectral theorem extends to a more general class of matrices. Let A be an operator on a finite-dimensional inner product space. A is said to be normal if A* A = A A*. One can show that A is normal if and only if it is unitarily diagonalizable: By the Schur decomposition, we have A = U T U*, where U is unitary and T upper-triangular. Since A is normal, T T* = T* T. Therefore, T must be diagonal since normal upper triangular matrices are diagonal. The converse is obvious. In other words, A is normal if and only if there exists a unitary matrix U such that :A=U D U^* \\\\; where D is a diagonal matrix. Then, the entries of the diagonal of D are the eigenvalues of A. The column vectors of U are the eigenvectors of A and they are orthonormal. Unlike the Hermitian case, the entries of D need not be real. Polar decomposition The polar decomposition of any bounded linear operator A between complex Hilbert spaces is a canonical factorization as the product of a partial isometry and a non-negative operator. The polar decomposition for matrices generalizes as follows: if A is a bounded linear operator then there is a unique factorization of A as a product A = UP where U is a partial isometry, P is a non-negative self-adjoint operator and the initial space of U is the closure of the range of P. The operator U must be weakened to a partial isometry, rather than unitary, because of the following issues. If A is the one-sided shift on l2(N), then A = {A*A}¬Ω = I. So if A = U A, U must be A, which is not unitary. The existence of a polar decomposition is a consequence of Douglas' lemma: :Lemma If A, B are bounded operators on a Hilbert space H, and A*A ‚â§ B*B, then there exists a contraction C such that A = CB. Furthermore, C is unique if Ker(B*) ‚äÇ Ker(C). The operator C can be defined by C(Bh) = Ah, extended by continuity to the closure of Ran(B), and by zero on the orthogonal complement of Ran(B). The operator C is well-defined since A*A ‚â§ B*B implies Ker(B) ‚äÇ Ker(A). The lemma then follows. In particular, if A*A = B*B, then C is a partial isometry, which is unique if Ker(B*) ‚äÇ Ker(C). In general, for any bounded operator A, :A^*A = (A^*A)^{\\\\frac{1}{2}} (A^*A)^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}, where (A*A)¬Ω is the unique positive square root of A*A given by the usual functional calculus. So by the lemma, we have :A = U (A^*A)^{\\\\frac{1}{2}} for some partial isometry U, which is unique if Ker(A) ‚äÇ Ker(U). (Note Ker(A)=Ker(A*A)=Ker(B)=Ker(B*), where B=B*=(A*A)¬Ω.) Take P to be (A*A)¬Ω and one obtains the polar decomposition A = UP. Notice that an analogous argument can be used to show A = P'U' , where P' is positive and U' a partial isometry. When H is finite dimensional, U can be extended to a unitary operator; this is not true in general (see example above). Alternatively, the polar decomposition can be shown using the operator version of singular value decomposition. By property of the continuous functional calculus, A is in the C*-algebra generated by A. A similar but weaker statement holds for the partial isometry: the polar part U is in the von Neumann algebra generated by A. If A is invertible, U will be in the C*-algebra generated by A as well. Connection with Complex Analysis Many operators that are studied are operators on Hilbert spaces of holomorphic functions, and the study of the operator is intimately linked to questions in function theory. For example, Beurling's theorem describes the invariant subspaces of the unilateral shift in terms of inner functions, which are bounded holomorphic functions on the unit disk with unimodular boundary values almost everywhere on the circle. Beurling interpreted the unilateral shift as multiplication by the independent variable on the Hardy space. . A sophisticated treatment of the connections between Operator theory and Function theory in the Hardy space. The success in studying multiplication operators, and more generally Toeplitz operators (which are multiplication, followed by projection onto the Hardy space) has inspired the study of similar questions on other spaces, such as the Bergman space. Operator algebras The theory of operator algebras brings algebras of operators such as C*-algebras to the fore. C*-algebras A C*-algebra, A, is a Banach algebra over the field of complex numbers, together with a map * : A ‚Üí A. One writes x* for the image of an element x of A. The map * has the following properties:. An excellent introduction to the subject, accessible for those with a knowledge of basic functional analysis. * It is an involution, for every x in A :: x^{**} = (x^*)^* = x * For all x, y in A: :: (x + y)^* = x^* + y^* :: (x y)^* = y^* x^For every Œª in C and every x in A: :: (\\\\lambda x)^* = \\\\overline{\\\\lambda} x^* . * For all x in A: :: \\\\x^* x \\\\ = \\\\x\\\\\\\\x^*\\\\. Remark. The first three identities say that A is a *-algebra. The last identity is called the C* identity and is equivalent to: \\\\xx^*\\\\ = \\\\x\\\\^2, The C*-identity is a very strong requirement. For instance, together with the spectral radius formula, it implies that the C*-norm is uniquely determined by the algebraic structure: :: \\\\x\\\\^2 = \\\\x^* x\\\\ = \\\\sup\\\\\\\\{\\\\lambda : x^* x - \\\\lambda \\\\,1 \\\\text{ is not invertible} \\\\\\\\}.

It runs from the Ohio state border, where it connects to State Route 15 (SR 15), north to Lansing, where it terminates at a junction with Interstate 496 (I-496) and the Capitol Loop. The highway mainly serves local communities along the route as it passes through farm lands in the southern part of the state. One short segment, in Jonesville, is routed concurrently with US Highway 12 (US 12). The segment within Lansing follows Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. The current highway is the third to carry the M-99 designation. The others were located near Lake Michigan near Muskegon in the Lower Peninsula and Gulliver in the Upper Peninsula in the 1920s and 1930s. The current highway was first designated as parts of M-34 and M-64 in 1919. These numbers were later dropped in favor of an M-9 designation in 1929. For part of 1934, a loop route was designated M-158 in Hillsdale County that was used for a rerouted M-9 in the area. The M-99 designation was applied to the highway in 1940. Since then, the state has completed paving twice; one segment was returned to gravel surface for two years in the 1950s. The southern section in Hillsdale County was rerouted in the 1960s, and sections were converted into divided highways in the late 1970s. Route description SR 15 ends at the Michigan state line just north of Pioneer, Ohio, where it becomes M-99. The roadway travels northward from the state line on Pioneer Road, through mostly agricultural areas of Hillsdale County before reaching a junction with M-34 just west of Osseo. The trunkline turns westward on Hudson Road, which curves to the north around Baw Beese Lake just southeast of Hillsdale. M-99 passes through Hillsdale on a northwest course on Broad Street and Carlton Road, passing just a few blocks to the west of Hillsdale College. After leaving town, the road bends to the north as Olds Street as it runs parallel to the St. Joseph River to Jonesville. In that community, M-99 intersects US 12\\\\. The two highways run concurrently through Jonesville for less than half a mile (0.8 km) before M-99 returns to its northwesterly course. It leaves the town toward Litchfield continuing parallel to the river. Welcome sign at the Ohio state line where SR 15 becomes M-99 northbound In Litchfield, M-99 enters the town from the southeast, passing near downtown where it meets the northern terminus of M-49. The highway leaves Litchfield heading northwest on Homer Road for a few miles before bending to the north as it crosses into Calhoun County. The trunkline passes through more farmland as it runs toward Homer on Hillsdale Street. In Homer, after passing through a roundabout, M-99 meets M-60, and the two highways run concurrently through the town to the northeast. The road briefly splits into a divided highway near the end of the concurrency; M-99 heads north, while M-60 continues eastward. From here, M-99 continues northward on 28 Mile Road toward the city of Albion. After crossing the Kalamazoo River in downtown, M-99 merges with Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94). M-99 continues east concurrently with the business loop on Michigan Avenue passing near Albion College before heading back north to an interchange with I-94 at exit 124; this interchange marks the end of BL I-94 and M-99 continues northward on Eaton Rapids Road. M-99 heads north through farmland to the village of Springport where it turns eastward along Main Street as it passes through the town. The highway continues easterly on Eaton Rapids Road before turning northward to cross into Eaton County. Shortly after crossing the county line, M-50 comes in from the southwest to meet up with M-99. The two highways travel together into Eaton Rapids. Together they form Main Street in the city before they separate on the north side of town. M-50 leaves to the northwest as Dexter Road, and M-99 continues to the northeast as Canal and Michigan streets. For the next few miles, the trunkline splits into a divided highway and runs parallel to the general course of the Grand River. M-99 crosses the river southeast of Dimondale after the opposing directions merge back together as an undivided highway. North of the river crossing, M-99 meets I-96 at the latter's exit 101 on the southern border of Lansing. From I-96, the M-99 continues north through residential neighborhoods into Lansing as Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. The highway travels northeasterly through the southern side of the capital city, as far as Jolly Road. There it turns northward through the Old Everett Neighborhood. The street is bordered by commercial properties in this area. M-99 widens into a boulevard as it passes the T-intersection with Victor Avenue, passing through the Moores Park neighborhood before crossing the Grand River. North of the river, the highway is bordered by the site of the former Lansing Car Assembly plant, which for a century produced Oldsmobiles and other GM cars. M-99 ends at a junction with I-496 just north of the assembly plant area at exit 5; Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard continues north from this interchange as the Capitol Loop. M-99 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-99 were the 32,262 vehicles daily north of Mount Hope Avenue in Lansing, on average; the lowest count was 2,300 vehicles per day between the state line and the M-34 junction. No section of M-99 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. History Previous designations When the state highway system was originally signed in 1919, M-99 was designated on a road between the Lake Michigan shoreline and M-11 (now US 31) between Muskegon and Hart. This highway was decommissioned in 1929. In 1931, M-99 was designated on a gravel road in the Upper Peninsula from US 2 just east of Gulliver) to Port Inland on Lake Michigan. This highway was decommissioned as well in 1939. Current designation In 1919, the highway that is now M-99 was first signed as M-64 from the Ohio state line to Hillsdale and as M-34 from Hillsdale to the Litchfield area. In 1924, the western terminus of M-34 was extended to Homer where it terminated at M-60. Just a few years later, in 1926, the western terminus was truncated, to end at Hillsdale; the remainder to Jonesville became an extension of the M-64. In 1929, this version of M-64 was renumbered M-9. In 1934, M-9 traveled on Pioneer Road in Hillsdale County, from the Ohio border before turning west on Burt Road, north on Clark Road, west on Montgomery Road then north onto Hillsdale Road. During this time a loop was planned to continue north from the corner of Pioneer and Burt Roads to Montgomery Road where it turned west and met with M-9 at Clark Road. This short loop was designated M-158, however later in the year the routing of M-9 was shifted onto the M-158 alignment, eliminating that route. By the middle of 1936, the highway was extended northward to end in Lansing. The M-9 designation was replaced with M-99 in 1940. By 1947, M-99 was completely paved. One segment between Litchfield and Homer was converted back to gravel surface in 1952; a change that was reverted two years later. By 1960, the former US 12/M-99 concurrency through Albion was redesignated Business US 12 through the city when the I-94/US 12 freeway was completed. Within a year, that business loop was redesignated BL I-94 when the US 12 designation was removed from the freeway and applied to the former US 112; at the same time, the US 112/M-99 concurrency in Jonesville became US 12/M-99 as well. A new alignment of M-99 highway was opened from the Ransom area north to Osseo in 1966; the western terminus of M-34 was scaled back to end at the new highway near Osseo and M-99 supplanted M-34 from Osseo to Hillsdale. The divided highway section of M-99 was opened north of Eaton Rapids in 1979. The Michigan Department of State Highways first announced plans in 1970 to expand M-99 within the Lansing city limits. The plan called for conversion of M-99 to a boulevard between Victor and Pulaski streets, on the south side of the Grand River; after crossing the Grand River, the roadway would be split into a one- way pairing northerly to Kalamazoo Avenue, with northbound traffic along the existing routing on Logan Street and southbound traffic following Birch Street. Construction of such a routing was slated to displace of residential district and some businesses along Logan Street. Construction on this realignment began in 1973, and the boulevard routing from Victor to Pulaski opened in late 1977. In 1989, Logan Street through Lansing was given an additional name, Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. This dual-naming scheme lasted until 1994 when the Logan Street name was removed, leaving only Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.

Historically a part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, from the Norman conquest to 1868, Kiveton was a hamlet of the parish of Harthill-with-Woodall. It subsequently transferred to the civil parish of Wales which takes its name from the neighbouring village. Geography Kiveton Park is located at approximately , at an elevation of around above sea level, and is located west of Worksop, and south-east of both Sheffield, and Rotherham respectively. It lies on the B6059 road (Station Road) and is served by two railway stations: Kiveton Bridge and Kiveton Park. The Chesterfield Canal lies to the south, while the villages of Todwick and South Anston are to the north and east. Kiveton Park lays claim to being in Rotherham Borough Council, has a Sheffield postcode, a Worksop telephone code, and has the Chesterfield Canal running through it. The village has two railway stations: Kiveton Bridge railway station in the centre of the village; and Kiveton Park railway station. History Kiveton gets its name from the Anglo-Saxon for the settlement in the hollow. In the Domesday Book it is written \\"Ciuetone\\", and was under the ownership of William de Warenne. It subsequently transferred to the de Keuton family, who sold the estate to the heirs of the former Lord Mayor of London Sir William Hewett (of the neighbouring hamlet of Wales, died 1567) in 1580. One of his descendants was Thomas Osborne who became the first Duke of Leeds. He arranged the building of a stately home in the village, Kiveton Hall (also spelled Keveton, Keeton or Keton Hall), in 1698. The building was demolished by George William Frederick Osborne, 6th Duke of Leeds in 1812, with local legend stating that the demolition was the result of a bet with the then Prince of Wales (subsequently George IV of the United Kingdom). After Kiveton Hall was demolished, Hornby Castle became the main seat of the Dukes of Leeds. The traditional burial place of the Dukes of Leeds was All Hallows Church, Harthill. A Community History Project has been set up to record and encourage an understanding of the history of Kiveton Park and neighbouring Wales, particularly mining heritage. This was based in the Old Colliery Offices. Economy The old colliery offices, Kiveton Coal mining has traditionally been the principal industry of Kiveton, and dates back to the Middle Ages. Much of the coal is near to the surface, and as early as 1598, the area was extracting 2,000 tons a year. By the middle of the 19th century, the coal-fields were being served both by canal and by rail, and in 1866, the Kiveton Park Colliery was sunk, making it one of the earliest deep mines in the world. As a result of the new colliery, the population of Kiveton increased from 300 to 1,400 over a period of ten years. The pit closed in 1994, resulting in the loss of 1,000 jobs. As a consequence, Kiveton is now essentially a commuter base for adjacent towns. Kiveton contains a steelworks at the bottom of Redhill, which was damaged by fire on 27 August 2009. All of the colliery buildings have since been demolished, including the originally protected pit-head baths (built in 1938), with the exception of the 1870s office building with its gothic clock tower, which still remains. The Kiveton Park and Wales Community Development Trust uses the office building as a base. The trust's aims are to provide services and increase development within the community sector. Sport Kiveton's sporting history extends back to 1879, when Kiveton Park Colliery Cricket Club was formed. The club has been a member of the Bassetlaw and District Cricket League since its inception in 1904. The first team did compete in an ECB Premier League competition (the Nottinghamshire Premier League) for the 2011 season after winning the Bassetlaw League a year earlier, but were relegated back after one year. In 1881, Kiveton Park Football Club was formed. The club has played in the FA Cup and FA Vase on numerous occasions. They currently play in the Sheffield County Senior League, having previously been members of the Yorkshire League, Northern Counties East League and the Central Midlands League. The village is the birthplace of football manager Herbert Chapman, and his brother Harry, a Sheffield Wednesday player. At one time the village football club was reputed to have produced more professional footballers than any place its size in England, with the Chapman brothers, Derek Ashton (Aston Villa), Bert Morley (Notts County and England), Sidney Cartwright (Arsenal), Leslie Hoften (Manchester United), Eric Oakton (Chelsea) and Walter Wigmore (Birmingham City) all coming from the village. Patrick Barclay, in his book about Herbert Chapman, wrote: \\"Kiveton Park could claim to have been a cradle of two revolutions, one industrial and the other sporting, and beyond question it is the birthplace of at least one great man, widely considered the father of football as we have come to know it. \\" Radio Following broadcasts since 2000, on Saturday 27 March 2010 Kiveton gained its own community radio station on a 5-year licence under Redroad FM on 102.4FM.

Efforts to start a Seattle library had commenced as early as 1868, with the system eventually being established by the city in 1890. The system currently comprises 27 branches, most of which are named after the neighborhoods in which they are located. The Seattle Public Library also includes Mobile Services and the Central Library, which was designed by Rem Koolhaas and opened in 2004. The Seattle Public Library also founded the Washington Talking Book & Braille Library (WTBBL), which it administered until July 2008. All but one of Seattle's early purpose-built libraries were Carnegie libraries. Although the central Carnegie library has since been replaced twice, all the purpose-built branches from the early 20th century survive; however, some have undergone significant alterations. Ballard's former Carnegie library has since housed a number of restaurants and antique stores among other enterprises, while others such as the Fremont and Green Lake branches have been modernized and remain in use as libraries.

The 26 branches have roughly one million cataloged physical items including Books, CDs, DVDs. In addition all locations have uncatalogued collections of books that can be borrowed without a library card. History The public library in Henry Yesler's former home downtown at Third and James, burned on the night of January 1‚ÄìJanuary 2, 1901 The downtown Carnegie Library as it appeared in 1919 Late 19th century: founding Seattle's first attempt to start a library association occurred at a meeting of 50 residents on July 30, 1868, but produced only minimal success over the next two decades.Seattle Public Library: History , Seattle Public Library. Accessed online 28 August 2008. The Ladies' Library Association began a more focused attempt to put together a public library in 1888. They had raised some funds and had even obtained a pledge of land from Henry Yesler, but their efforts were cut short by the Great Seattle Fire of 1889. Nonetheless, encouraged by their ideas, the revised October 1890 city charter formally established the Public Library as a branch of the city government. The ladies' influence can be seen in that the charter required that at least two of the five library commissioners be women. The library was funded by a 10% share of city fines, penalties, and licenses.Seattle Public Library Annual Report 1915, p. 6‚Äì7. The first library opened April 8, 1891 as a reading room on the third floor of the Occidental Block‚Äîlater the Seattle Hotel‚Äîsupervised by librarian A. J. Snoke. By December 1891 when books were first allowed to be borrowed, it had 6,541 volumes. Snoke was succeeded in 1893 by John D. Atkinson, who was succeeded in 1895 by Charles Wesley Smith, who remained in the position until 1907. Smith took over a library that, like all of Seattle, had been seriously impacted by the Panic of 1893: by 1895 its annual budget was only half of what it had been that first year.Seattle Public Library Annual Report 1915, p. 7. In its first decade or so, the growing library \\"developed the traveling habit\\". In June 1894, it moved across Second Avenue to the Collins Block. By 1895, the budget situation was so dire that Smith initially experimented with charging borrowers ten cents to borrow a book; the experiment was a failure and in 1896 the library moved to the Rialto, a building farther north on Second Avenue, far enough north that at that time it stood outside of Seattle's core. As the city grew out, that building was later occupied by the Frederick and Nelson department store. At the Rialto, the library for the first time moved to an open-stacks policy, where users could browse through the shelves for themselves instead of presenting a request to a librarian. In 1898 the library moved again to the former Yesler Mansion, a forty-room building on the site that would later become the King County Courthouse.Seattle Public Library Annual Report 1915, p. 8. Meanwhile, in 1896, the library established a bindery, and a new city charter drastically decreased the power of the library commission and removed the requirement of its having female members. This greatly increased Smith's power, a change which he himself opposed; in 1902 a new Library Board would be established, again gaining supervisory rather than merely advisory power. Early 20th century: the first great era of growth On the night of January 1, 1901, the Yesler Mansion burned taking most of the library collection with it.According to , the library had about 25,000 volumes at the time of the fire. The library records were salvaged, along with the 2,000 volumes of the children's collection. Other than those, though, practically the only books salvaged were the 5,000 that were out on circulation at the time. The library operated for a time out of Yesler's barn, which had survived, then moved to a building that had been left behind when the University of Washington had moved from downtown to its present campus.Seattle Public Library Annual Report 1915, p. 9. By January 6, Andrew Carnegie had promised $200,000 to build a new Seattle library; he later added another $20,000 when this budget proved inadequate. The new Carnegie library was built not far from the former university campus, occupying the entire block between 4th and 5th Avenues and between Madison and Spring Streets. The land was purchased for $100,000. In August 1903, the city selected a design submitted by P. J. Weber of Chicago for a building to be constructed largely of sandstone. Ground was broken in spring 1905 and the library was dedicated December 19, 1906. Shortly after moving to these new permanent quarters, Smith was succeeded in 1907 by Judson T. Jennings. Meanwhile, the library began to grow in other respects. A reference department had been established in 1899. In 1903 a position was established for a children's librarian. In 1904 a plan was established to grow eventually to 12 departments. The periodical division was established in 1906, the art division in 1907, and the technology division in 1912. Branch libraries had opened in rented quarters in Fremont (1903), Green Lake (1905), and the University District (1908). In 1908, Carnegie donated $105,000 to build permanent branches in the University District, Green Lake, and West Seattle (all of which opened in summer 1910). The annexation by Seattle of the city of Ballard brought with it another already established Carnegie library, and a further Carnegie donation of $70,000 in 1911 built the Queen Anne branch (opened 1914) and the Columbia Branch (opened December 31, 1915 in Columbia City). The land in the Central District donated by Henry Yesler to the Ladies' Library Association was traded to the parks department and the money was city funds were used to buy land and erect a library about east of downtown and named after Yesler. It would later be renamed as the Douglass-Truth branch. The 1921 opening of the permanent Fremont branch‚Äîalso funded with Carnegie money‚Äîbrought this era of great expansion to an end. It would be over three decades before The Seattle Public Library opened another proper branch. Even as early as 1915, the library was collecting books not only in English but in many other languages spoken in Seattle (though all of the languages collected at that time were European: there were as yet no Asian language collections). In 1915, the library had collections in Croatian, \\"Dano-Norwegian\\" (Bokm√•l), Finnish, French, German, Italian, Lithuanian, Modern Greek, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, and Yiddish. Ten other languages were also lightly represented.Seattle Public Library Annual Report 1915, p. 37. Seattle also had established one of only three collections for the blind in the country west of the Mississippi River, the other two being in San Francisco and Portland, Oregon. In 1915 this collection had 698 volumes.Seattle Public Library Annual Report 1915, p. 38. In 1916, 67,097 people borrowed books from the library. That was 19 per cent of the population of the city. At that time the system appears to have had more total points of contact with the public than today, though few of these were proper branches. A civics textbook from the era indicates the library's points of contact with the public as \\"the central library, 9 branch libraries, 8 drug store deposit stations, 32 fire-engine houses, 420 school rooms in 77 schools, 3 play grounds and 8 special deposit stations.\\" Mid 20th century stagnation Paul Thiry-designed North East branch (opened 1954) stood in sharp architectural contrast to the older branch libraries. Seattle suffered heavily in the Great Depression. The Library's official website describes the Library as having been \\"pummeled\\" in this period of \\"soaring demands and evaporating resources\\". In 1930, a 10-year-plan announced an \\"urgent\\" need for a $1.2 million bond issue to expand the Central Library. In the event, nothing of the sort happened. During the Depression, the Central Library became a refuge for the jobless. Library circulation hit record heights, passing 4 million in 1932. Meanwhile, budgets were cut, employees were laid off, and programs were terminated. The Library's 1939 budget was $40,000 less than its 1931 budget. The Library's 50th anniversary in 1941 occasioned the foundation of Friends of The Seattle Public Library. The economic revival brought about by World War II, and the post-war prosperity, began to bring the library out of its institutional stagnation. Seattle spent $400,000 on a book stack addition to the Central Library in 1949, and three modern new branch libraries were built in 1954. Nonetheless, the library was simply not used nearly as much in this era as in the Depression years. While the city's population had grown from 368,000 to 463,000 since 1932, only 2.4 million books were being borrowed annually, as against over 4 million. Bond issue votes to build a more modern central library failed in 1950 and 1952. At mid-century, The Seattle Public Library had numerous \\"book stations\\" for areas with no branch as such, in locations such as a \\"rented shop space, clubhouse, or hospital,\\" each with a small, frequently changing collection of books. These book stations were open half-time, and serves one-sixth as many readers as the branch libraries. A bookmobile with 2,500 books serviced two dozen other locations. Also, at this time The Seattle Public Library was a mainstay of the King County Library System (then known as the King County Rural Library District), with 70,000 book loans in 1948 to King County patrons outside the city. By mid-century, The Seattle Public Library circulated a lot more than books. Even in its early years, the library collection had included items such as sheet music. By 1948, the circulating collection included 3,500 phonograph records, which were borrowed a total of 53,000 times that year, as well as 6,000 pieces of sheet music, 6,000 song books and piano albums, 200 reproductions of famous paintings, and 27,000 other pictures. In 1950, the library subscribed to 200 newspapers (mostly from Washington State) and 1,700 periodicals. The 1960s The Bindon and Wright downtown library (just below center), photographed here in 1969 Stairs lead up through a garden to the Magnolia library The city finally passed its first-ever library bond issue in 1956. This funded, among other things, a new $4.5 million, central library, designed in the International style by the Seattle firm of Bindon & Wright, and built on the same site as its Carnegie predecessor. Dedicated March 26, 1960, it featured the first-ever escalator in an American library, a drive-up window for book pick-ups and was Seattle's first public building to incorporate significant new works of art. Among the artists represented were James FitzGerald, Glen Alps, and Ray Jensen. It also incorporated a fountain by sculptor George Tsutakawa, the first of many fountains Tsutakawa would construct over the remainder of his career. The new library energized the public library system. The library's official web site writes that \\"the atmosphere in the opening weeks was likened to a department store during the holiday shopping season. The new Central Library loaned out almost 1 million volumes in its first nine months, a 31 percent increase over the previous year's circulation.\\" A library that had been \\"struggling with disinterest in a shabby headquarters\\" now found itself \\"loved to tatters,\\" with greater demand than it could readily satisfy. The 1956 bond issue also provided $500,000 for branch libraries. This paid for the construction of the Southwest Branch (1961), a new Ballard Branch (1963; later Abraxus BooksRebekah Schilperoort, Condo delayed; bookstore stays, Ballard News-Tribune, May 15, 2007. Accessed online 29 August 2008.), and the Magnolia Branch (1964). The Magnolia Branch was designed by Paul Hayden Kirk and incorporates the Japanese influences found in much Northwest architecture of the era. The bond issue also bought the land for the Broadview Branch, but did not provide the funds to build it; that branch finally opened in 1976. Late 20th century: Recession and recovery In the 1970s and into the 1980s, The Seattle Public Library experienced another period of tight budgets and constricted services, but the picture was never as bleak as in the Great Depression. In 1975 the Yesler Branch‚Äîearlier in danger of closing‚Äîwas renamed as the Douglass-Truth Branch, honoring Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth. That branch features an extensive African American collection. A $2.3 million federal grant refurbished and expanded public areas of the Central Library in 1979. Another federal grant gave $1.2 million for the Rainier Beach Branch (1981). In the late 1980s, a $4.6 million project restored the Library's six Carnegie branches; this project was recognized with an honor from the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Meanwhile, capping the career of Library Board president Virginia Burnside, The Seattle Public Library Foundation was established in 1980 to increase outside financial support of the Library. By the mid-1990s, during the dot-com boom years, annual donations exceeded $1 million, while library circulation passed 5 million items annually. 1998-present: \\"Libraries for All\\" In 1998, Seattle voters, with an unprecedented 69 percent approval rate, approved the largest library bond issue then ever submitted in the United States. The $196 million \\"Libraries for All\\" bond measure, along with private funds raised by The Seattle Public Library Foundation, nearly doubled the square footage in Seattle's libraries, including the building of new branches and a new Central Library. As of 2006, The Seattle Public Library system had 699 staff members (538 full-time equivalents). It circulated 3,151,840 adult books, 1,613,979 children's books, 570,316 WTBBL materials, and 3,895,444 other media (CDs, DVDs, videotapes, etc.) Staff members answered more than 1 million reference questions.History factsheets - SPL website The system also provides 1,134 public computers.2006 Annual Report Anyone with a library card can get up to one and a half hour a day of free computer use; the system accepts reservations for a computer at a particular time at a particular branch. The library has moved to an RFID system for materials, which allows people to check out their materials without assistance, freeing librarians to focus on matters other than circulation. From 1993 to 2004, the library was home to Nancy Pearl, one of the few celebrity librarians in the English-speaking world. Pearl's Book Lust book series and her much-imitated \\"If All Seattle Read the Same Book\\" project (now called \\"Seattle Reads\\") resulted in her being perhaps the only librarian who has ever been honored with an action figure. After the Great Recession resulted in eight separate operating budget cuts between 2009 and 2012,Jonna Ward, \\"From the Executive Director\\", The Next Chapter (The Seattle Public Library Foundation), Winter 2012, p.2. in November 2012 Seattle voters passed a 7-year levy to restore services. The levy enabled all branches to provide Sunday service (15 previously did not), increased the number of branches with 7-day-a-week service from 12 to 14, added to the maintenance and repair fund, and provided new funds to purchase physical materials, electronic content, and additional computer equipment.\\"Library Levy Brings Big Changes in 2013\\", The Next Chapter (The Seattle Public Library Foundation), Winter 2012, p.1. The library unveiled its proposed rebranding strategy in September 2015, including a new name and new logo, that attracted widespread controversy over its cost; the first phase of the project cost $365,000 and the total cost would have been $1.3 million out of private donations. The board of trustees ultimately rejected the proposal on October 28, 2015, citing negative public feedback and other pressing uses for the funds. A $219 million property tax levy was approved by Seattle voters in August 2019 to fund library services, including extended hours at branches, seismic renovations, social services. The levy also included funding to eliminate overdue fines for patrons, which came into effect on January 2, 2020. Architecture Many of The Seattle Public Library's facilities are notable works of architecture. They reflect the aesthetics of several very different periods. The various former Carnegie libraries and the Douglass-Truth library all date from a single period of two decades in the early 20th century. No further branch libraries were built between 1921 and 1954, and when branch construction resumed, the International style had swept away the earlier revivalism. Today's Greenwood and North East branches are both expanded versions of 1954 libraries, the latter originally designed by Paul Thiry; a third library from 1954, the Susan J. Henry branch on Capitol Hill, has been entirely replaced, as has Bindon & Wright's 1960 Central Library.

By raising and lowering the body using the arms, push-ups exercise the pectoral muscles, triceps, and anterior deltoids, with ancillary benefits to the rest of the deltoids, serratus anterior, coracobrachialis and the midsection as a whole. Push-ups are a basic exercise used in civilian athletic training or physical education and commonly in military physical training. They are also a common form of punishment used in the military, school sport, and some martial arts disciplines. Etymology The American English term push-up was first used between 1905 and 1910, while the British press-up was first recorded between 1945 and 1950. Body mass supported during push-ups According to the study published in Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, the test subjects supported with their hands, on average, 69.16% of their body mass in the up position, and 75.04% in the down position during the traditional push-ups. In modified push-ups, where knees are used as the pivot point, subjects supported 53.56% and 61.80% of their body mass in up and down positions, respectively. Muscles worked While the push-up primarily targets the muscles of the chest, arms, and shoulders, support required from other muscles results in a wider range of muscles integrated into the exercise. Military recruits will often perform push-ups as part of their physical training. Here, U.S. Marine recruits at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego perform push-ups in May 2005, as a part of their basic recruit training.  Abdominals  The rectus abdominis and transversus abdominis contract continually while performing push-ups to hold the body off the floor and keep the legs and torso aligned. The rectus abdominis spans the front of the abdomen and is the most prominent of the abdominal muscles. The transversus abdominis lies deep within the abdomen, wrapping around the entire abdominal area. Both muscles compress the abdomen, and the rectus abdominis also flexes the spine forward, although it does not execute this function when performing push-ups.  Deltoid  The anterior portion of the deltoid muscle is one of the major shoulder-joint horizontal adductors, moving the upper arms toward the chest during the upward phase of a push-up. It also helps control the speed of movement during the downward phase. The deltoid attaches to parts of the clavicle and scapula, just above the shoulder joint on one end, and to the outside of the humerus bone on the other. Along with horizontal adduction, the anterior deltoid assists with flexion and internal rotation of the humerus within the shoulder socket.  Chest muscles  The push up requires the work of many muscle groups, with one of the primary muscle groups being the chest muscles, the pectoralis major and the minor. These are the two large chest muscles and the main pushing muscle group of the upper body. When pushing and lowering the body during a push-up, the pectoralis major is doing most of the work. As a result, these muscles become very strong and can become defined as lean muscle after doing push-ups regularly.  Stabilisers: back body  The push-up depends on stabiliser muscles as the body is pushed and lowered. The erector spinae is the main stabiliser muscle in the back. Made up of three muscles including the spinal, longissimus, and iliocostalis. The spinal runs adjacent to the spine, the longissimus runs adjacent to the spinal and the iliocostalis runs adjacent to the longissimus and over the ribs. Two muscles called the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus stabilises the upper leg. The medius and minimus sit under the largest butt muscle, the gluteus maximus.  Triceps brachii  While the anterior deltoids and pectoralis major muscles work to horizontally adduct the upper arms during the upward phase of a push-up, the triceps brachii muscles, or triceps for short, are also hard at work extending the elbow joints so the arms can be fully extended. The triceps also control the speed of elbow-joint flexion during the downward phase of the exercise. The closer together the hands are placed during a push-up, the harder the triceps work. The muscle is divided into three heads ‚Äî the lateral head, long head, and medial head. The lateral and medial heads attach to the back of the humerus bone, and the long head attaches just behind the shoulder socket on one end; all three heads combine and attach to the back of the elbow on the other. There is a special sub-set of the diamond push-up (so named for the diamond-shaped space between the hands when the thumb and forefinger of the left hand are placed on the floor up against the thumb and forefinger of the right hand.) The special version of this push-up is when the diamond is placed directly below the nose instead of the solar plexus. The nose must almost touch the floor in the center of the diamond. This special diamond push-up is done by the United States Marine Corps. The lips must come within 1 inch of the floor while keeping the neck in line with the straight spine to qualify as a valid push-up. This can be verified by placing a 1-inch foam disposable earplug on the floor in the center of the diamond and picking it up with the lips.  Forearms  Stabilizers include wrist and forearm muscles, the knee extensors, and the hip/spine flexors, which all work isometrically to maintain a proper plank position in the standard prone push-up.  Biceps  During the push-up exercise, the short head of the biceps brachii muscle acts as a dynamic stabilizer. This means the muscle activates at both ends‚Äîthe elbow and the shoulder‚Äîto help stabilize the joints.  Joints and tendons  Inner muscles that support the operation of the fingers, wrists, forearms, and elbows are also worked isometrically. Some push-up modifications that require to have the arms at different heights effectively engage the rotator cuff. Variations In the \\"full push-up\\", the back and legs are straight and off the floor. There are several variations besides the common push-up. These include bringing the thumbs and index fingers of both hands together (a \\"diamond push-up\\") as well as having the elbows pointed towards the knees. These variations are intended to put greater emphasis on the triceps or shoulders, rather than the chest muscles. When both hands are unbalanced or on uneven surfaces, this exercise works the body core. Raising the feet or hands onto elevated surfaces during the exercise emphasizes the upper (minor) or lower (major) pectorals, respectively. Raising the hands with the aid of push- up bars or a dumbbell allows for a greater range of motion, providing further stress for the muscles. Weighted push-ups Progressively overloading classic push-ups using barbell plates, resistance bands or any form of weight. The load is usually positioned on the upper back. This very effective exercise is not commonly performed because of the difficulty of loading the human body in that position. Knee push-ups \\"Modified\\" or \\"knee\\" push-ups are performed by supporting the lower body on the knees instead of the toes, which reduces the difficulty. These are sometimes used in fitness tests for women, corresponding to regular push-ups for men. This is useful for warm-ups/downs, pyramids/drop sets, endurance training, and rehab. It can also be used to train in a more explosive plyometric manner (like clapping push-ups) when one can't perform them with the feet. It can also be used with the 1-arm variations as a transition. However, the intense pressure on the knees can be harmful. Planche push-ups Planche position An extremely difficult variation is to perform a push-up using only hands, without resting the feet on the floor, i.e., starting from and returning to the planche position. These are known as \\"planche push-ups\\". To do this variation, the body's center of gravity must be kept over the hands while performing the push-up by leaning forward while the legs are elevated in the air, which requires great strength and a high level of balance. The entire body weight is lifted in this variation. Knuckle push-ups Another variation is to perform push-ups on the knuckles of the fist, rather than with palms of the hands on the floor. This method is also commonly used in martial arts, such as Karate and Tae Kwon Do, and may be used in boxing training while wearing boxing gloves. The intent, in addition to building strength and conditioning, is to toughen the knuckles, wrist, and forearm in the punching position. This variation also reduces the amount of strain in the wrist, compared to the typical \\"palms on floor\\" approach, and so it is sometimes used by those with wrist injuries. Such practitioners will usually perform their knuckle push-ups on a padded floor or a rolled-up towel, unlike martial artists, who may do bare-knuckle push-ups on hard floors. Maltese push-up The Maltese push-up is a gymnastic variation of the push-up, in which the hands are positioned further down towards the hips (as opposed to roughly alongside the pectorals), but with a wide distance between them. Hindu push-up The Hindu push-up, also known as a dand. This is the most basic version, similar to that used by Bruce Lee who referred to it as a cat stretch. The most basic form of Hindu push-up starts from the downward dog yoga position (hands and feet on the floor with the posterior raised) and transitions to a cobra pose position (hands and feet on the floor with the torso arched forwards and the legs close to the floor). It is also known as a dand. It is common in Indian physical culture and Indian martial arts, particularly Pehlwani.Mujumdar D.C., The Encyclopedia of Indian Physical Culture, 1950, p.460, plate 131 Bruce Lee also used it in his training regime and referred to it as a 'cat stretch'.Lee, Bruce, 'Preliminaries' in The Tao of Jeet Kune Do, California: Ohara Publications, 1975, p.29 It is an effective core strength exercise because it dynamically involves both the anterior and posterior chains in a harmonious fashion. There are numerous variations of the Hindu push-up although most incorporate the two postures used in the most basic version. It may also be known as a Hanuman, judo, or dive-bomber push-up. Guillotine push-up The guillotine push-up is a form of push-up done from an elevated position (either hands-on elevated platforms or traditionally medicine balls) wherein the practitioner lowers the chest, head, and neck (thus the name) past the plane of the hands. The goal is to stretch the shoulders and put extra emphasis on the muscles there. Backhanded push-up The backhanded push-up is a form of push-ups performed using the back of the hands, rather than the palms. Currently, the record holder of the backhanded push-ups is Bill Kathan who broke the world record in 2010, by performing 2,396 on Valentine's Day. One arm versions A U.S. Army employee demonstrates a one-arm push-up in an extended position. Many of the push-up variations can be done using one arm instead of two. This will further increase the resistance put upon the trainee. Single-leg push- up Lift one leg off the ground and do a set. Switch legs on the next set. Narrow-grip push-up Do a normal push-up with your hands just a few inches apart from each other underneath the chest. Wide-grip push-up Similar to a normal push-up but with wider spacing of the hands. This works the chest and shoulders more. Clap push-up At the peak of the push-up, push yourself up off the ground and quickly clap in midair. The fast jolting force of clap push-ups will help develop explosive power while also bulking up the pectoral muscles for a more defined chest. Spiderman push-up Do a normal push-up but raise one knee toward the elbow of the same side as you rise. Switch knees with each rep. Also, add more stress to your abs with a 2-second hold. Other versions There are some less difficult versions, which reduce the effort by supporting some of the bodyweights in some way. One can move on to the standard push-up after progress is made. \\"Wall\\" push-ups are performed by standing close to a wall and pushing away from the wall with the arms; one can increase the difficulty by moving one's feet farther from the wall. \\"Table\\" or \\"chair\\" push-ups are performed by pushing away from a table, chair, or other object. The lower the object, the more difficult the push-up. One should be sure that the object is securely stationary before attempting to push up from it. \\"Three-phase\\" push-ups involve simply breaking a standard push up into three components and doing each one slowly and deliberately. Participants usually start face down on the floor with hands outstretched either perpendicular or parallel to the body. The first phase involves the arms being brought palms down on a 90-degree angle at the elbows. The second phase involves the body being pushed into the up position. The third phase is returning to the starting position. This technique is commonly used after a large block of regular push-ups, as it poses less stress and requires less effort. \\"Diamond\\" or \\"Triceps\\" push-ups are done by placing both palms on the ground and touching together both thumbs and pointer fingers. This technique requires stronger triceps muscles than regular push-ups because, at the bottom of the stroke, the forearm is nearly parallel to the ground and the elbow is almost completely flexed, resulting in a much higher mechanical load on the triceps. \\"Hollow-Body\\" push-ups are performed in the position gymnasts call the \\"hollow body\\". In the plank version of the hollow body, the shoulders are protracted into a pronounced curve in the upper back while the abdominal muscles are tightened and the legs are locked and squeezed together. This variation requires full-body tension to execute and results in greater integration of the hips, shoulders, and core. Plyometrics Two platforms are placed beside the trainee, one on either side. The exercise begins with the hands-on either platform supporting the body, then the subject drops to the ground and explosively rebounds with a push-up, extending the torso and arms completely off the ground and returning the hands to the platforms. Another is simply an explosive push-up where a person attempts to push quickly and with enough force to raise his or her hands' several centimeters off the ground, with the body completely suspended on the feet for a moment, a variation of the drop push. This is necessary for performing 'clap push-ups' - i.e. clapping the hands while in the air. Aztec push-ups The Aztec push-up is one of the most difficult plyometric push-ups. A person performs an Aztec push-up by beginning in the normal push-up starting position and exploding upward with both the hands and feet, driving the entire body into the air. While in the air, the body is bent at the waist and the hands quickly touch the toes. The body is then quickly straightened and the hands and feet break the fall, returning the body to the normal push-up position for another repetition. 360 push ups The 360 push-up is a variation of the superman push- up where one rotates 360 degrees while in the air. Falling and explosive rebound push ups Here one falls to the ground from standing position and then using an explosive push-up gets back to standing position. With push-ups, many possibilities for customization and increased intensity are possible. Some examples are: One hand can be set on a higher platform than the other or be farther away from the other to give more weight to the opposite arm/side of the body and also exercise many diverse muscles. One can perform push-ups by using only the tips of the fingers and thumb. For increased difficulty, push- ups can be performed on one arm or using weights. Push-ups between chairs form an integral part of the \\"Dynamic Tension\\" Course devised by Charles Atlas, and similar systems.

Its permanent collection includes over 24,000 works from Canadian, and indigenous Canadians, and international artists. The museum also holds the world's largest collection of Inuit art. In addition to exhibits for its collection, the museum has organized and hosted a number of travelling arts exhibitions. Its building complex consists of a main building that includes of indoor space and the adjacent Inuit Art Centre. The present institution was formally incorporated in 1963, although it traces its origins to the Winnipeg Museum of Fine Arts, an art museum opened to the public in 1912 by the Winnipeg Development and Industrial Bureau. The bureau opened the Winnipeg School of Arts in the following year, and operated the art museum, and art school until 1923, when the two entities were incorporated as the Winnipeg Gallery and School of Arts. In 1926, the Winnipeg Art Gallery Association was formed to assist the institution in operating its museum component. The Winnipeg Gallery and School of Art was dissolved in 1950, although its collection was loaned indefinitely to the Winnipeg Art Gallery Association, who continued to exhibit it. In 1963, the Winnipeg Art Gallery Association was formally incorporated as the Winnipeg Art Gallery by the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba. The museum moved to its present location in September 1971, with the opening of a purpose-built building designed by Gustavo da Roza. In 2018, the museum began construction of the Michael Maltzan designed Inuit Art Centre, in order to house the museum's Inuit art collection.  History  Background During the 1890s, the Manitoba Hotel housed the city's first art gallery The city's first serious art gallery was first opened in the former Manitoba Hotel (built by the Northern Pacific Railway), located at Main and Water Ave. An area of the hotel was set aside for an art studio. The art gallery was organized by Cora Moore, who upon return from a trip to Toronto, organized a Winnipeg branch of the Women's Art Association of Canada and subsequently an artists group for men. The first art exhibit took place in February 1895. The art gallery featured art from artists from Manitoba, as well as Toronto, Montreal, New York, London, and Paris. The art gallery was shut down after the Manitoba Hotel burned down in 1899. Efforts to create another art museum began in 1902, after the Manitoba Society of Artists was formed, and its members began to lobby for the creation of a provincial civic and arts institution. In addition to the Manitoba Society of Artists, the Winnipeg-branch of the Western Art Association adopted a mandate that promoted the creation of an art museum to art from Manitoba, and the rest of Canada in 1908. =Gallery and school of art= After the first phase of the Board of Trade building was completed in April 1912, the Winnipeg Development and Industrial Bureau unveiled plans for its second phase expansion of the building, which featured a space designated for an art museum. The art museum, named the Winnipeg Museum of Fine Arts, was formally opened by the Mayor of Winnipeg Richard Deans Waugh, the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba Douglas Cameron, and the president of the Winnipeg Development and Industrial Bureau on 16 December 1912. The first exhibition held at the museum featured 275 works from the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. Building upon the success of the art museum, the bureau opened the Winnipeg School of Arts in the same building on 21 June 1913. The art school, and art museum operated as separate departments of the same institution, initially under the controlled by the bureau. The institution became independent of the bureau in April 1923, when it was formally incorporated as the Winnipeg Gallery and School of Art by the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba. The western wing of the Civic Auditorium building exhibited the collection of the Winnipeg Gallery from 1932 to 1971 However, by the mid 1920s, the institution faced financial difficulties, and was forced to suspend most museum operations in 1926, with its remaining expenses for the museum being paid towards insurance, campaigns to increase membership, and sundry repairs. The museum's permanent collection was held by the School of Art in trust while the museum was closed. In August 1926, the Winnipeg Art Gallery Association was formed to assist the museum in its operations. The gallery resumed normal operations on 22 April 1932, when it was reopened at the Civic Auditorium's (the present Manitoba Archives Building) western wing. The School of Art remained in the Board of Trade building until its demolition in 1935, and was relocated twice, in 1936, and 1938. In June 1950, the Winnipeg Gallery and the School of Art was formally dissolved, with the School of Art being incorporated into the University of Manitoba. Works collected for the former institution's permanent collection were loaned to the Winnipeg Art Gallery Association for an \\"indefinite\\" period, who continued to exhibit the collection at the Civic Auditorium. Winnipeg Art Gallery (1963‚Äìpresent) On 6 May 1963, the Winnipeg Art Gallery Association was formally incorporated as the Winnipeg Art Gallery by the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba. In 1965, discussions were raised to move the art gallery from the Civic Auditorium, although the institution opposed a proposed move to the Manitoba Centennial Centre, along with the Centennial Concert Hall, and the Manitoba Museum. The Winnipeg Art Gallery criticized the proposal stating that, \\"the politicians of the city have set various arts groups on each other, and the result has been many objections. We of the Arts Gallery are sitting tight ‚Äî but we are not sitting still.\\" In 1967, the museum acquired a triangular plot of land across from the Civic Auditorium, and launched a competition for architects to submit designs for a new building. The proposed design required the demolition of several buildings on the proposed site, including an unused service station, and the Cinema Centre building. Work on a new museum building began in 1969. View of the new building for the art museum in 1971 The gallery moved to its present location in 1971, into a building designed by Canadian architect Gustavo Da Roza. Along with expanding the exhibition spaces, the new building also allowed for the museum's storage conservation unit to be housed in the same building, as opposed to an off-site location. Construction for the building cost approximately C$4.5 million, with the funding coming from the federal and provincial governments, private donations, as well as a public campaign to raise funds. The building was officially opened to the public on 25 September 1971 by Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon. In October 1995, the museum expanded its property by acquiring the former Medical Mall building adjacent to its own building, and used it to house the museum's art studio programs. In 2012, the museum, and the National Gallery of Canada entered into a three-year agreement to exhibit works from the National Gallery's collection at the Winnipeg Art Gallery. In November 2015, the Government of Nunavut reached a five-year loan agreement with the Government of Manitoba, to exhibit the Government of Nunavut's collection of 8,000 works at the Winnipeg Art Gallery. The Government of Nunavut collection formed in 1999, and was originally housed in the Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre in Yellowknife. The Government of Nunavut originally planned to house the collection in a climate controlled facility in Iqaluit, although those plans were later abandoned. WAG@ThePark at the Assiniboine Park pavilion. In 2016, the museum and the park's conservancy entered a partnership that saw the museum curate exhibitions at the pavilion. In June 2016, the museum opened a retail space, known as WAG@The Forks, in an effort to promote and sell Inuit art at The Forks. The retail space was the result of a partnership formed between the Government of Nunavut, and the Winnipeg Art Gallery. In September 2016, the museum, and the Assiniboine Park Conservancy opened WAG@ThePark at the Assiniboine Park pavilion. WAG@ThePark was opened as a partnership between the Winnipeg Art Gallery and the Assiniboine Park Conservancy, which saw the museum curate exhibitions in the building. Most of the works from the exhibitions at WAG@ThePark is from the Conservancy's collection, although some Inuit works from the museum's permanent collection were also exhibited at the pavilion. In 2018, a lost painting by Alfred Munnings was located in the permanent collections of the Winnipeg Art Gallery. The painting depicts Brigadier General R.W. Paterson's horse, Peggy, during the First World War, and was lost shortly after a Royal Academy of Arts exhibition in 1919, which featured that piece, and 43 other works from Munnings. The lost painting was identified in the Winnipeg Art Gallery's permanent collection after a public appeal to locate the work was issued by the British National Army Museum; in their efforts to recreate the 1919 exhibition. According to the Winnipeg Art Gallery, the painting entered its collection in 1984, donated to them by Paterson's children. The former Medical Mall building was demolished in 2017 in order to accommodate the construction of a new building to house the museum's collection of Inuit art, known as the Inuit Art Centre, which broke ground in May 2018. The groundbreaking ceremony for the Inuit Art Centre was held in May 2018, and featured the lighting of a qulliq, an Inuit drum dance, and throat singing. Cost for the construction of the Inuit Art Centre is estimated to be C$65 million, with C$35 million obtained from the federal, provincial, and municipal government, and the remaining funds covered by public and private donors. The centre would be the first museum building in the world dedicated to Inuit art upon its opening. Architecture The main property the Winnipeg Art Gallery presently occupies was acquired in 1967. The museum's main building was opened on the property on 25 September 1971. In 1995, the property was expanded after the museum acquired the former Medical Mall south of the main building. In 2017, the former Medical Mall was demolished to make way for the museum's Inuit Art Centre. The main building and Inuit Art Centre will be connected by a skyway between the two buildings. Main building The main building of the museum complex features a rooftop garden The main building for the Winnipeg Art Gallery was opened in September 1971, and was designed by Gustavo da Roza in a late-modernist style. During the design and construction process, da Roza partnered with Number Ten Architects, who provided architectural drafting and project management. The building's exterior was designed as an iceberg-shaped \\"triangular mass,\\" with an austere low silhouette, and almost no windows throughout its exterior. The building's exterior walls are sloped to reflect sunlight, and uses \\"aggressive\\" geometric angles. A wedge that protrudes from the \\"main mass\\" forms the entrance to the main building. Most of the building was built from poured-in-place, reinforced concrete and clad in Tyndall stone. According to da Roza, the use of Tyndall stone for the load bearing wall was selected to help affirm the \\"character of [the] northern prairie environment.\\" Tyndall stone is also used extensively for the walls and floor of the interior, and the lounges in the building's second floor. The interior of the gallery was designed to help maintain and preserve works exhibited in the building, and includes mechanical systems that maintain the atmosphere of the building at an appropriate temperature and humidity for the works. As a result of the building's angular shape, nearly every room in the building has a different shape from the other rooms in the building. The interior of the building features of exhibition space. Most of the building's viewing galleries are located on the third floor, which also features a skylight set from the building's rooftop garden; whereas the mezzanine level is dedicated to smaller exhibition spaces, the museum's library, and offices. The ground level, known as Ferdinand Eckhardt Hall, is a large space sheathed in saw-cut Tyndall stone, and houses the museum's gift shop and art rental store, conservation lab, the main lobby, and a 320-seat auditorium complete this level. The museum's restaurant facilities and access to the rooftop garden are located on the building's fourth floor, while its storage for its collections are located in the building's basement. The total indoor area of the building is .  Inuit Art Centre  Inuit Art Centre under construction in April 2020 The museum property is also home to the Inuit Art Centre, a four-storey building, situated to the south of the main building at Memorial Boulevard and St. Mary Avenue. Michael Maltzan, the principal architect for Michael Maltzan Architecture, was contracted to design the building in 2012. PCL Construction was contracted to construct the building. Construction for the building began in late May 2018, after the former building that occupied the site, the Medical Mall, was demolished in 2017. The building is expected to open in 2020. The design of the Inuit Art Centre was intended to both complement the existing main building, as well as reflect where most of the works intended to be housed in the building originated from. The building's exterior is clad in glass and off-white stone, although concrete and steel were also used as building materials. The building will features 22 recessed skylights approximately above the floor. The skylights are designed to emit light on its exterior side, glowing \\"like a lantern\\". A curved designed is used throughout the interior, as a reflection of Northern Canada's \\"openness\\". The Inuit Art Centre's atrium features a serpentine steel frame of the building's three-storey visible storage for works for items in the Inuit collection not on exhibit. The visible storage is adjacent to the building's entrance on the corner of St. Mary's Avenue and Memorial Boulevard, with a lecture room, caf√©, and reading room adjacent to the building's atrium. The building's second level includes a 90-seat theatre, a library, and a learning commons on the second floor. Most of the museum's exhibition space is located on the building's third floor, which has approximately of exhibition space. Five indoor, and two outdoor art studios are situated on the buildings uppermost level. The upper roof level of the building is also designed to provide space for exhibitions, public performances.  Permanent collection  As of March 2015, the Winnipeg Art Gallery's permanent collection includes over 24,000 works from Canadian, and international artists. Approximately 70 percent of the permanent collection was gifted to the museum by private donors. Summer Afternoon, the Prairie by Lionel LeMoine FitzGerald was the first work purchased by the museum for its permanent collection. The collection is organized into several collection areas, Canadian art, decorative arts, Inuit art, international art, photography, and works on paper. The photography collection was made a specialized area of its permanent collection during the 1980s. Its photography collection includes 1,400 works, most of which originated from Canadian artists in the latter half of the 20th century. The museum's works on paper collection contains approximately 6,000 items in its collection, encompassing historical to contemporary works by international artists, and Canadian artists, whose works make up the majority of the works on prints collection. Canadian art Maurice Cullen, 1901. The painting is held in the museum's collection of Canadian art. The museum's Canadian collection includes works from Canadian artists dating back to the 1820s to the present day. The museum's permanent collection includes 200 works by Canadian artists from 1820 to 1910. Work by Canadian artists prior to the 20th century in the museum's collection include those created by Maurice Cullen, Mary Riter Hamilton, John A. Hammond, Robert Harris, Otto Reinhold Jacobi, Paul Kane, Cornelius Krieghoff, James Wilson Morrice, Lucius Richard O'Brien, William Raphael, George Agnew Reid, Peter Rindisbacher, Frederick Arthur Verner, and Homer Watson. The collection also features a sizable collection of Canadian modern art (works produced from 1910 to 1979) including works by artists of the Winnipeg Gallery and School of Art, Painters Eleven, and the Regina Five. The museum's Canadian modern art collection also includes a number of works from the Group of Seven, including over 1,000 works from Group of Seven member Lionel LeMoine FitzGerald. Other works in the collection by modern Canadian artists include Bertram Brooker, Emily Carr, Charles Comfort, Ivan Eyre, Prudence Heward, William Kurelek, David Milne, Walter J. Phillips, and Tony Tascona. The museum's also has a collection contemporary art from Canadian artists, most of which is made up equally of prints and paintings, although it also includes collages, drawings, installations, sculptures, and videos. The museum's collection of contemporary Canadian art includes works by Eleanor Bond, Aganetha Dyck, Cliff Eyland, Wanda Koop, Janet Werner, and the Royal Art Lodge. Decorative art As of March 2015, the museum's decorative art collection includes more than 4,000 works of ceramic, glass, metal, and textiles from the 17th century to the present. The decorative arts collection began in the 1950s, when the museum was bequeathed a collection of decorative works from Melanie Bolton-Hill. The collection includes 1,500 ceramics from British artisans in the 18th and 19th centuries; nearly 1,000 Art Nouveau and Art Deco-styled glass objects from the late 19th century to the early 20th century; and 500 works of silver from British and Canadian silversmiths. International art The museum's international art collection is made up of paintings from American and European artists from the 19th and 20th centuries. The museum's international collection includes the Gort Collection, which features 19 panel paintings, and 5 tapestries from Northern Renaissance artists in the 15th and 16th centuries. The Gort Collection was bequeathed to the museum in 1973, although prior to that, it was already on long-term loan to the institution since 1954. The museum's international art collection also includes works by Alexander Archipenko, Eug√®ne Boudin, Marc Chagall, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Raoul Dufy, Henri Fantin-Latour, Dan Flavin, Sol LeWitt, and Henry Moore. Inuit art Inuit sculptures on exhibit in the museum's main building The Winnipeg Art Gallery's permanent collection also includes the world's largest collection of Inuit art, numbering over 13,000 works in March 2019. Inuit carvings make up nearly two-thirds of the museum's Inuit collection, which includes 7,500 antler, bone, ivory, and stone carvings, dozens of hand-sewn wall hangings. Other works in the collection includes 3,000 prints and drawings from Inuit artists. The first works for the museum's Inuit collection was acquired in thet 1950s, although the museum's first substantial acquisition of Inuit works came in 1960, when George Swinton donated 130 sculptures to the museum. The collection was further bolstered in 1971, when the Jerry Twomey Collection, featuring 4,000 Inuit works, was donated to the museum. In 1989, Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (later renamed Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada) donated 1,400 prints and drawings from Inuit artists to the museum. Since 1972, the museum has appointed a full-time curator to oversee its collection of Inuit art. Most of the works from the museum's Inuit collection are stored in the basement storage space of its main building, although the museum plans to move these pieces to the Inuit Art Centre; either in its visible storage vault, or on exhibit. Library and archives The museum also operates a library and archives, maintained by its curatorial department. Known as the Clara Lander Library, its holdings include books, and records that assists in the museum's educational mandate; whereas its archives contains administrative, curatorial, and educational documents relating to the museum. Access to the Clara Lander Library is free of charge, although a written request must be submitted to the museum in order to access its materials.

The accumulated substances interfere with the normal gas exchange and expansion of the lungs, ultimately leading to difficulty breathing and a predisposition to developing lung infections. The causes of PAP may be grouped into primary and secondary causes, although the most common cause is a primary autoimmune condition. Signs and symptoms The signs and symptoms of PAP include shortness of breath, a cough, low grade fever, and weight loss.The clinical course of PAP is unpredictable. Spontaneous remission is recognized, and some patients have stable symptoms. Death may occur due to the progression of PAP or of any underlying associated disease. Individuals with PAP are more vulnerable to lung infections such as bacterial pneumonia, mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infection, or a fungal infection. Causes The abnormal accumulation of lipoproteinaceous compounds in PAP is due to impaired surfactant regulation and clearance. This is usually related to impaired alveolar macrophage function.In adults, the most common cause of PAP is an autoimmunity to granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a critical factor in development of alveolar macrophages. Decreased bioavailability of GM-CSF results in poor alveolar macrophages development and function, which results in accumulation of surfactant and related products. Secondary causes of PAP are those in which the accumulation of lipoproteinaceous compounds is secondary to another disease process. This has been recognized in the settings of certain cancers (such as myeloid leukemia), lung infections, or environmental exposure to dusts or chemicals. Although the cause of PAP was not originally understood, a major breakthrough in the understanding of the cause of the disease came by the chance observation that mice bred for experimental study to lack a hematologic growth factor known as granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) developed a pulmonary syndrome of abnormal surfactant accumulation resembling human PAP. The implications of this finding are still being explored, but significant progress was reported in February 2007. Researchers in that report discussed the presence of anti-GM-CSF autoantibodies in patients with PAP, and duplicated that syndrome with the infusion of these autoantibodies into mice. Familial or sporadic inactivating mutations in one of the two parental GATA2 genes produces an autosomal dominant disorder termed GATA2 deficiency. The GATA2 gene produces the GATA2 transcription factor which is critical for the embryonic development, maintenance, and functionality of blood-forming, lympathic-forming, and other tissue-forming cells. Individuals with a single GATA2 inactivating mutation present with a wide range of disorders including pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. GATA2 mutation-based pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is associated with normal levels of GM-CSF and commonly improves or is avoided in afflicted individuals who successfully receive a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Genetics Abnormalities in CSF2 receptor alpha have been shown to cause hereditary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. This gene is located on chromosome 5 in the 5q31 region. This gene product is also known as granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor. Diagnosis Intermediate magnification micrograph of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. H&E; stain. The diagnosis of PAP is made using a combination of a person's symptoms, chest imaging, and microscopic evaluation of lung washing/tissue. Additional testing for serum anti-GM-CSF antibodies are helpful for confirmation. Although both the symptoms and imaging findings are stereotypical and well-described, they are non-specific and indistinguishable from many other conditions. For example, chest x-ray may show alveolar opacities, and a CT may show a crazy paving lung pattern, both of which are seen more commonly in numerous other conditions. Thus, the diagnosis primarily depends on the pathology findings. Lung washings or tissue for histopathologic analysis are most commonly obtained using bronchoalveolar lavage and/or lung biopsy. Characteristic biopsy findings show filling of the alveoli (and sometimes terminal bronchioles) with an amorphous eosinophilic material, which stains strongly positive on PAS stain and the PAS diastase stain. The surrounding alveoli and pulmonary interstitium remain relatively normal. Electron microscopy of the sample, although not typically performed due to impracticality, shows lamellated bodies representing surfactant. An alternative diagnosis with similar histomorphologic findings is Pneumocystis jirovicii pneumonia. Lung washings characteristically yield a fluid which is \\"milky\\"composition. Under the microscope, samples show 20-50 micrometer PAS- positive globules on a background of finely granular or amorphous PAS-positive material. There is typically a low numbers of macrophages and inflammatory cells (although this is variable). Treatment The standard treatment for PAP is whole-lung lavage, in which the lung is filled with sterile fluid with subsequent removal of the fluid along with the abnormal surfactant material. This is generally effective at improving PAP symptoms, often for a prolonged period of time.Since the mouse discovery noted above, the use of GM-CSF injections has also been attempted, with variable success.Lung transplantation may be performed in refractory cases. Epidemiology The disease is more common in males and in tobacco smokers. In a recent epidemiologic study from Japan, Autoimmune PAP has an incidence and prevalence higher than previously reported and is not strongly linked to smoking, occupational exposure, or other illnesses. Endogenous lipoid pneumonia and non-specific interstitial pneumonitis has been seen prior to the development of PAP in a child. History PAP was first described in 1958 by the physicians Samuel Rosen, Benjamin Castleman, and Averill Liebow. In their case series published in the New England Journal of Medicine on June 7 of that year, they described 27 patients with pathologic evidence of periodic acid Schiff positive material filling the alveoli. This lipid rich material was subsequently recognized to be surfactant. The reported treatment of PAP using therapeutic bronchoalveolar lavage was in 1960 by Dr. Jose Ramirez-Rivera at the Veterans' Administration Hospital in Baltimore, who described repeated \\"segmental flooding\\" as a means of physically removing the accumulated alveolar material. Research PAP is one of the rare lung diseases currently being studied by The Rare Lung Diseases Consortium (RLDC). The RLDC is part of the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN), an initiative of the Office of Rare Diseases Research (ORDR), of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS). The RLDC is dedicated to developing new diagnostics and therapeutics for patients with rare lung diseases, through collaboration between the National Institutes of Health, patient organizations and clinical investigators.

It is on the west coast of the island of Viti Levu,in the Ba Province of the Western Division. Lying in the heart of Fiji's sugar cane-growing region, the city has come to be known as the Sugar City. Covering an area of 32 square kilometres, it had a population of 71,573 at the 2017 census, the most recent to date. Economic activities Lautoka is known as the Sugar City because of its sugar cane belt areas. The main Lautoka Sugar Mill was founded in 1903, and is the city's biggest employer by far. Built for the Colonial Sugar Refining Company (Fiji) (CSR) by workers from India and the Solomon Islands between 1899 and 1903, it hires some 1,300 employees today. Other industries include timber milling, garment manufacturing, distillery, brewery, jewellery, blending, steelworks, fishing, hatchery, domestic items, paints, and construction. In 2012 Lautoka was announced as the administration capital of the western division... History The name of the city is derived from two Fijian words meaning \\"spear hit.\\" According to an oral tradition, the name arose following a duel between two chiefs. As one speared the other, he was reported to have cried \\"Lau-toka!\\" (\\"Bull's eye!\\"). The first known European sighting of the Lautoka area took place on 7 May 1789. Captain William Bligh spotted and roughly charted the coasts of Lautoka while making his epic voyage to Timor, in the wake of the mutiny on the Bounty. Politics Incorporated as a town in 1929, Lautoka was proclaimed a city on 25 February 1977. It is governed by a 16-member city council, who elect from among themselves a mayor. Lautoka currently does not have a mayor but has a government-appointed administrator like all urban centres in Fiji since the military coup of 2006. The former administrator was Parveen Bala, who was also mayor of Ba. A well-known past Mayor is Ratilal Patel, who was elected mayor in 1967. Lautoka is the only city in Fiji's Western Division, and is the industrial hub of Fiji which contains more than 50 percent of the nation's population. It is also the headquarters of the Fiji Electricity Authority, the Fiji Pine Ltd, and the National Marketing Authority. Mass media The headquarters and studios of Mix FM Fiji are located in Lautoka. With National coverage, MixFM is the only English station in Fiji to be based outside of Suva. Demography Grocery store in Lautoka. Since 1970, the population of Lautoka has grown rapidly, and in the last twenty years it has also changed dramatically in structure. In the early 1970s the population was estimated to be about 12,000, the vast majority of inhabitants being Indian, as would be expected considering the early growth of the city was entirely associated with the sugar industry. Almost all of the present Indian inhabitants are descendants of the early girmityas. In 1986 the population was 39,000 and in 1996 almost 43,000, but it is not clear exactly how the boundaries of the urban area were defined at either of these censuses. In 2005 the population including the suburban zones was probably about 50,000, occupying a total area of about 16 km2. The population of Lautoka including the rural districts is around 80,000. But much of the recent growth of the city itself has been due to indigenous Fijians moving into the urban area. The city is the birthplace of PGA Tour Hall of Famer Vijay Singh and Ghazal and Tabla star Cassius Khan. Health and medical services During the COVID-19 pandemic, the city recorded the first cases of the virus in the country, causing the immediate lockdown of the city. The lockdown lasted 18 days, with only essential services allowed to operate and no one allowed to enter or exit the confined area.  Transport  Port of Lautoka is the main maritime gateway for western Viti Levu and is the second largest port in Fiji. The port is mainly used for bulk sugar, molasses, woodchips, petroleum and gas. The port is also used for cruises, Blue Lagoon Cruises and Nai's Cruises are based here. Lautoka is served by Pacific Transport and Sunbeam buses. Pacific Transport connects Lautoka directly to Nadi Intl Airport and Ba. Sunbeam runs 8 times daily Queen's Highway Service, linking Lautoka to Suva with stops at Nadi International Airport, Nadi Town, Fijian (Shangri ‚Äì La) Resort, Sigatoka Town, Abua Sands, Hideaway Resort, Naviti Resort, Korolevu, Warwick Resorts, Beach House, Crusoes Retreat Junction, Deuba Inn and Tradewinds Lami.

The episode premiered on NBC on September 22, 1994. It was written by the show's creators David Crane and Marta Kauffman, and directed by James Burrows. The pilot introduces six twenty-something friends who live and work in New York City: Monica Geller: a single sous chef in her early 20s who is illegally subletting her grandmother's apartment; Ross Geller, Monica's older brother, a paleontologist whose marriage recently ended because his wife, Carol, is a lesbian; Rachel Green, Monica's spoiled, self centered high school best friend who has just left her fiancee at the altar and is financially cut off by her father; Chandler Bing, Ross' college roommate and best friend who lives across the hall from Monica; Joey Tribbiani a struggling Italian-American actor and Chandler's roommate; and Phoebe Buffay, a laid back, hippie-ish masseuse, singer and guitar player. Crane and Kauffman pitched their original idea to network NBC in December 1993. NBC liked it and commissioned a complete script, which was submitted in March 1994. Before the script was finished, casting for the six main roles began; 75 actors were seen for each part. The pilot was taped on May 4, 1994, at Warner Bros.' studios in Burbank, California. After making final edits to the episode, executive producer Kevin Bright submitted it on May 11, two days before NBC was due to announce the schedule. Satisfied with the completed pilot, NBC ordered 12 more episodes for the first season. The episode was watched by approximately 22 million viewers, making it the fifteenth-most-watched television show of the week. Critics compared the show unfavorably to Seinfeld and Ellen, noting the similarities all three series had in depicting friends conversing about their lives. The cast, particularly Schwimmer, were complimented, though there was some concern that the character roles were undeveloped and that the plot for the pilot would not go over well with audiences.  Plot  At the Central Perk coffee shop, Monica Geller is teased by her friends, Phoebe Buffay, Chandler Bing and Joey Tribbiani, about going out with someone and claiming it is not a date. Ross Geller, Monica's older brother, arrives at the coffee shop, upset that his lesbian ex-wife has moved out of their apartment to begin a new relationship with her partner. A young woman suddenly arrives wearing a wet wedding dress, whom Monica recognizes as her high-school best friend, Rachel Green. Monica introduces her to the others as Rachel reveals she left her fianc√© at the altar, realizing that she does not love him. After Rachel's father cuts her off financially over the phone, Monica reluctantly takes Rachel in as a new roommate. Meanwhile, Joey and Chandler console Ross while helping him assemble new furniture. Ross begins to wonder if any woman would be \\"the right one\\" for him. Monica goes on her first date with Paul the \\"wine guy\\", who confides in her that he has not been able to perform sexually since his wife left him. Monica is touched by his admission, and they sleep together. The next day, however, she learns from a coworker that Paul's story about his ex-wife is just a ruse to pick up women. After her attempts to get a job are unsuccessful, Rachel ends up buying a new pair of boots with one of her credit cards, which she admits her father pays for. Egged on by the group, Rachel reluctantly cuts up her credit cards to announce her independence. That night, Ross and Rachel talk and he confesses that he once had a crush on her during high school; she admits that she knew. He asks if he can ask her out sometime, and she says yes. Ross leaves the apartment feeling newfound hope. In the final scene, the entire group are in Central Perk having coffee with Rachel, who begins a new career as a coffee shop waitress.  Production   Conception  Creators and writers David Crane and Marta Kauffman were known in the television industry for writing the cable television series Dream On. A second series by the duo, Family Album, had premiered on CBS in the Fall 1993 season but was cancelled after airing six episodes. In November 1993, they began developing three new television pilots from their offices at Warner Bros. Television that could premiere in the Fall 1994 season.Wild, p. 206. As Dream On had won them clout in Hollywood, they aimed to pitch one of their ideas to NBC; Insomnia Cafe, about six friends who live and work in New York City, was pitched as a seven-page treatment to the network in December 1993. > \\"It's about sex, love, relationships, careers, a time in your life when > everything's possible. And it's about friendship because when you're single > and in the city, your friends are your family.\\" :‚Äî Part of Crane and > Kauffman's original pitch for Insomnia Cafe NBC bought the pitch as a put pilot, meaning they risked financial penalties if the pilot was not filmed. To get an idea of how their characters would behave, Kauffman interviewed several of her children's twenty-something babysitters. She and Crane wrote the script in three days.Wild, p. 215. James Burrows, known for directing Cheers, was hired to direct it. He liked the script, though asked for Joey, who was originally written similarly to Chandler, to be \\"dumbed up a bit\\".Stallings, pp. 102‚Äì103. The script was completed in early March 1994, though before then eight-line character breakdowns had been sent to acting agencies in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago.  Casting  1,000 actors replied to the callouts for each role, but only 75 were called in to read for the casting director. Those who received a callback read again in front of Crane, Kauffman and their production partner Kevin S. Bright. At the end of March, the potential actors had been reduced to three or four for each part; they read for Les Moonves, president of Warner Bros. Television. David Schwimmer was first to be cast.Wild, p. 209. He was in Chicago doing a stage adaptation of The Master and Margarita when his agent offered him the audition. He was not interested in doing television after a bad experience appearing in Monty, but changed his mind when he learned that it was an ensemble script.Wild, p. 177. Unknown to him, Crane and Kauffman had remembered him from when he auditioned for an earlier pilot of theirs; they had written the part of Ross with Schwimmer in mind to play him. Eric McCormack also auditioned for the role several times. He later became famous for his lead role as Will Truman in the sitcom Will & Grace. Courteney Cox was the best-known cast member Courteney Cox was the most well-known of the six main actors. She was being considered for Rachel, but Cox read the script and thought she was a better fit for Monica. After reading for Monica instead, she won the role.Cox Arquette, Courteney, Friends: Final Thoughts Nancy McKeon also read for the part.Wild, p. 53. Jennifer Aniston read for the part of Rachel after initially being considered for Monica. Her contract with the CBS TV series Muddling Through meant that any role with Friends would be in second position to the series. The CBS show was not scheduled to be broadcast until mid-1994, after NBC's announcement of whether Friends would be greenlit; if Muddling Through became a ratings success and CBS enforced Aniston's contract, Friends would have had to recast her. Within three days of first auditioning for Friends Aniston nonetheless got the role,Aniston, Jennifer, Larry King Live because NBC Entertainment president Warren Littlefield correctly expected that Muddling Through would immediately fail. Crane and Kauffman wanted Joey to be \\"a guy's guy\\" who loves \\"women, sports, women, New York, women\\". The actors auditioned using the \\"grab a spoon\\" scene, and many arrived in character with \\"lots of chest showing\\". As the Joey character was not developed much in the script, Matt LeBlanc just used his experience playing \\"this Italian, kind of dim character\\" from Vinnie & Bobby.Wild, p. 115. He had at least eight auditions for the part, and in his final one read with Aniston and Cox.LeBlanc, Matt, Friends: Final Thoughts Chandler and Phoebe had originally been written as more secondary characters who were just there to provide humor around the other four; Matthew Perry described Chandler in the pilot script as \\"an observer of other people's lives\\". They had become part of the core group by the time casting concluded.Wild, p. 146.Kauffman, Marta, Friends: Final Thoughts Crane believed that the part of Chandler, described in the character breakdown as \\"a droll, dry guy\\", would be the easiest to cast, though it proved more difficult than he initially hoped.Crane, David, Friends: Final Thoughts Perry had previously worked with Kauffman and Crane on an episode of Dream On, and requested an audition when he identified with the character. He was turned down due to his involvement as a cast member in LAX 2194, a television pilot about airport baggage handlers in the future. After the producers of Friends saw LAX 2194, it became clear to them that it would not be picked up for a series, and Perry was granted an audition. He read for the role near the end of the casting period and got it in under a week.Perry, Matthew, Larry King Live Before Perry was cast, Craig Bierko was first choice for the role. Bierko was a friend of Perry's, and Perry coached him for his audition to help him get to know what the Chandler character was like. Jon Cryer had also auditioned for the part. He was doing a play in London and read for a British casting director, though his audition tape did not arrive at Warner Bros. in time for him to be considered. Many actresses who read for Phoebe arrived at the audition in character, wearing \\"bell bottoms and clunky shoes and nose rings\\". Kathy Griffin and Jane Lynch auditioned for the role. Lisa Kudrow won the role because the producers liked her as Ursula, the waitress in Mad About You.Bright, Kevin S., Friends: Final Thoughts She was second to be cast, though there was about a month between her and Schwimmer being signed on. Many of the actors seen by Moonves were \\"too theatrical\\" in performing comedy; Crane described the six successful actors as being the only ones who \\"nailed\\" their parts. The six actors met for the first time altogether at the read- through on April 28, 1994.Kudrow, Lisa, Friends: Final Thoughts John Allen Nelson and Clea Lewis guest-star as Paul and Franny, Monica's date and co- worker, respectively. Cynthia Mann appears as a Central Perk waitress.  Filming  The set of Central Perk, where many scenes in the episode were filmed. A dress rehearsal was held on May 2, two days before taping. Several NBC executives watched the rehearsal and were concerned that Monica did not care enough about Paul to sleep with him on their first date. NBC West Coast president Don Ohlmeyer believed that the audience would perceive her as \\"a slut\\".Wild, p. 16. Crane, Kauffman and Warner Bros. executives disagreed, and surveyed the other people watching the rehearsal to support their position. Despite the audience agreeing with them, they had to take NBC's considerations into account in case they lost the commission; they rewrote Monica's lines to show that she cared about Paul. NBC also wanted a scene removed that implied the supposedly-impotent Paul was getting an erection, as it would violate network standards. Crane and Kauffman rewrote the scene and found they preferred the new version, as it made the scene \\"smart and subtler\\". They sought to protect other parts of the script, some major and some minor; NBC wanted two of the pilot's three storylines downplayed to subplots, but the writers were adamant that all three should carry equal weight. They also favored not cutting the \\"Mr. Potato Head\\" line. Their final script draft was completed on May 3. The episode was taped on May 4 at Warner Bros.' studios in Burbank, California. A total of eight hours of material was filmed (two hours from each of the four cameras), which was edited down to 22 minutes under Bright's supervision. Bright submitted it to NBC on May 10, 72 hours before the fall schedule was announced. NBC ordered Bright to make further edits, which he completed at 1 a.m. on May 11. On May 12, NBC screened the finished pilot to focus groups, who gave positive but mixed reactions. The network announced the fall schedule on May 13 and ordered an additional 12 episodes of Friends for its first season. Crane and Kauffman immediately received telephone calls from writers' agents who wanted to get their clients jobs on the series.  Reception  The episode was first broadcast on NBC on September 22, 1994 in the 8:30‚Äì9 p.m. (EST) timeslot. It ranked as the fifteenth-most-watched television show of the week, scoring a 14.7/23 Nielsen rating (each point represented 954,000 households) and nearly 22 million viewers. David Schwimmer received considerable praise Critics likened the episode to Seinfeld and Ellen; Tom Feran in The Plain Dealer wrote that it traded \\"vaguely and less successfully on the hanging-out style of Seinfeld\\", and Ann Hodges of the Houston Chronicle called it \\"the new Seinfeld wannabe, but it will never be as funny as Seinfeld. Even as Seinfeld is now, which isn't as funny as it used to be\\". Hodges criticized the \\"stiflingly dull social circle\\" as \\"short to the point of painful in brainpower\\". Robert Bianco in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that the \\"constant comic bantering grows a little tired, just as it would if it ever actually happened in real life\\", and questioned why the six characters had so much free time to talk about dates. In the Los Angeles Daily News, Ray Richmond, who had also seen the following two episodes, called the cast a \\"likeable, youth ensemble\\" with \\"good chemistry\\". He added that while Friends was \\"one of the brighter comedies of the new season\\", the pilot was \\"very weak\\". Diane Holloway for the Austin American-Statesman questioned Friends billing as a \\"sophisticated comedy\\", writing, \\"What's sophisticated about a guy who dreams his penis is a telephone?\\" She called the scene where Monica discovers Paul's impotence was a lie the least funny part of the episode, though conceded that the episode as a whole did have some funny moments. Robert P. Laurence wrote in The San Diego Union-Tribune that \\"A lot happens, but you'll still get the feeling you've seen Friends before\\", calling it \\"Seinfeld Plus Two. Or Ellen Plus Five.\\" In the Chicago Sun-Times, Ginny Holbert rated the episode three stars, and wrote \\"The clever series [...] stars an appealing group of actors who are just a bit funnier and better-looking than your average friend\\" but that Joey and Rachel's characteristics were under-developed. The Los Angeles Times called it \\"flat-out the best comedy series of the new season\\". Varietys Tony Scott had optimistic hopes for the series; he enjoyed the premise but was concerned that dialogue from the writers of Dream On should be \\"snappier\\". Scott was also concerned that the Monica storyline set a bad example for younger viewers; \\"Friends touts promiscuity and offers liberal samples of an openness that borders on empty-headedness\\". He singled out Cox and Schwimmer as the best actors of the ensemble. Robert Bianco was complimentary of Schwimmer, calling him \\"terrific\\". He also praised the female leads, but wrote that Perry's role as Chandler was \\"undefined\\" and that LeBlanc was \\"relying too much on the same brain-dead stud routine that was already tired the last two times he tried it\\". Entertainment Weekly rates the episode B+ and states that \\"After 22 minutes, these six people are believably set up as lifelong buddies\\". Ross' line, \\"Do the words 'Billy, Don't Be a Hero' mean anything to you?\\" is singled out as the best line of the episode. The authors of Friends Like Us: The Unofficial Guide to Friends call it a \\"good, solid start to the series\\" but \\"the regular cast (particularly Perry and Schwimmer) might be trying just a little too hard\\".Sangster & Bailey, p. 14. Schwimmer recalls enjoying the physical humor involving Ross, particularly the scene where Ross greets Rachel and opens an umbrella on her.Schwimmer, David, Friends: Final Thoughts The episode was syndicated for the first time on September 21, 1998. Several deleted scenes were restored to the episode, bringing its total running time to 37 minutes, for a one-hour timeslot. It gained a rating of 5.8/10, averaged across 40 stations. This made Friends the third-highest-rated off-network syndicated sitcom to air at that time, behind Home Improvement and Seinfeld.  Notes   References  Video *Hacopian, Christina (producer) (2004).

It allows most of the blood from the right ventricle to bypass the fetus's fluid-filled non-functioning lungs. Upon closure at birth, it becomes the ligamentum arteriosum. Development and structure The ductus arteriosus is formed from the left 6th aortic arch during embryonic development and attaches to the final part of the aortic arch (the isthmus of aorta) and the first part of the pulmonary artery. Disorder: Patent ductus arteriosus human adult heart, showing a patent ductus arteriosus connecting the pulmonary trunk to the arch of aorta Consequences Failure of the ductus arteriosus to close after birth results in a condition called patent ductus arteriosus, which results in the abnormal flow of blood from the aorta to the pulmonary artery: a left-to-right shunt. If left uncorrected, this usually leads to pulmonary hypertension followed by right ventricular heart failure, as well as possible cardiac arrhythmias. Role of prostaglandins The \\"E\\" series of prostaglandins are responsible for maintaining the openness of the ductus arteriosus (by dilation of vascular smooth muscle) throughout the fetal period. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), produced by both the placenta and the DA itself, is the most potent of the E prostaglandins, but prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) also has a role in keeping the DA open. PGE1 and PGE2 keep the ductus arteriosus open via involvement of specific PGE-sensitive receptors (such as EP4 and EP2). EP4 is the major receptor associated with PGE2-induced dilation of the DA and can be found across the DA in smooth muscle cells. Immediately after birth, the levels of both PGE2 and the EP4 receptors reduce significantly, allowing for closure of the DA and establishment of normal postnatal circulation. Role of non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs Ductus arteriosus closure may be induced by administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which inhibit prostaglandin production. The most common NSAID used is Indomethacin, which is usually administered in the first week after birth. However, in the presence of a congenital defect with impaired lung perfusion (e.g. Pulmonary stenosis and left-to-right shunt through the ductus), it may be advisable to improve oxygenation by maintaining the ductus open with prostaglandin treatment. However, such treatments are ineffective in an abnormal ductus. Persistence of the ductus may be associated with other abnormalities, and is much more common in females. By inhibiting PGE2 formation, EP4 receptor activation will decrease and normal circulation can begin. NSAIDs taken late in pregnancy can cross the placenta and lead to premature closure of the DA in the fetus. In this case, exogenous PDE2 can be administered to reverse the effects of the NSAIDs and maintain the patency of the DA for the remainder of the pregnancy. Incidence A patent ductus arteriosus affects approximately 4% of infants with Down syndrome (DS). A failure to thrive is a very common sign of this condition.Pritchard & Korf. \\"Medical Genetics at a Glance\\". Blackwell Publishing. 2010. p63. Maintaining patency In some types of congenital heart defect (e.g., transposition of the great arteries), prostaglandins may be administered to maintain the ductus arteriosus open, allowing for the continual circulation and oxygenation of blood, until surgery can be performed.

The flashes are produced by momentarily pivoting the mirror, or by interrupting the beam with a shutter. The heliograph was a simple but effective instrument for instantaneous optical communication over long distances during the late 19th and early 20th century. Its main uses were military, survey and forest protection work. Heliographs were standard issue in the British and Australian armies until the 1960s, and were used by the Pakistani army as late as 1975. Description Fig. 2: German heliograph made by R. Fuess in Berlin (on display at the Museum of Communication in Frankfurt) There were many heliograph types. Most heliographs were variants of the British Army Mance Mark V version (Fig.1). It used a mirror with a small unsilvered spot in the centre. The sender aligned the heliograph to the target by looking at the reflected target in the mirror and moving their head until the target was hidden by the unsilvered spot. Keeping their head still, they then adjusted the aiming rod so its cross wires bisected the target. They then turned up the sighting vane, which covered the cross wires with a diagram of a cross, and aligned the mirror with the tangent and elevation screws so the small shadow that was the reflection of the unsilvered spot hole was on the cross target. This indicated that the sunbeam was pointing at the target. The flashes were produced by a keying mechanism that tilted the mirror up a few degrees at the push of a lever at the back of the instrument. If the sun was in front of the sender, its rays were reflected directly from this mirror to the receiving station. If the sun was behind the sender, the sighting rod was replaced by a second mirror, to capture the sunlight from the main mirror and reflect it to the receiving station.Manual Of Instruction In Army Signaling 1886 Section III- Apparatus And Method Of Using It.

This type produced flashes by a shutter mounted on a second tripod (Fig 4).W. N. Millar (1920), Canadian Forestry Service. Methods of Communication Adapted to Forest Protection Google Books. Retrieved on 1 June 2008. pp. 160-181 are devoted to the heliograph, with diagrams of the British, American, and Godwin type. The heliograph had certain advantages. It allowed long distance communication without a fixed infrastructure, though it could also be linked to make a fixed network extending for hundreds of miles, as in the fort-to- fort network used for the Geronimo campaign. It was very portable, did not require any power source, and was relatively secure since it was invisible to those not near the axis of operation, and the beam was very narrow, spreading only 50 feet per mile of range. However, anyone in the beam with the correct knowledge could intercept signals without being detected.Kipling, Rudyard A Code of Morals. The Kipling Society website. Retrieved on 1 June 2008. In the Boer War, where both sides used heliographs, tubes were sometimes used to decrease the dispersion of the beam.Major J. D. Harris WIRE AT WAR - Signals communication in the South African War 1899‚Äì1902. Retrieved on 1 June 2008. Discussion of heliograph use in the Boer War. In some other circumstances, though, a narrow beam made it difficult to stay aligned with a moving target, as when communicating from shore to a moving ship, so the British issued a dispersing lens to broaden the heliograph beam from its natural diameter of 0.5 degrees to 15 degrees. The range of a heliograph depends on the opacity of the air and the effective collecting area of the mirrors. Heliograph mirrors ranged from 1.5 inches to 12 inches or more. Stations at higher altitudes benefit from thinner, clearer air, and are required in any event for great ranges, to clear the curvature of the earth. A good approximation for ranges of 20‚Äì50 miles is that the flash of a circular mirror is visible to the naked eye for 10 miles for each inch of mirror diameter, and farther with a telescope. The world record distance was established by a detachment of U.S. signal sergeants by the inter-operation of stations on Mount Ellen, Utah, and Mount Uncompahgre, Colorado, 183 miles (295 km) apart on September 17, 1894, with Signal Corps heliographs carrying mirrors only 8 inches square.Coe, Lewis The Telegraph: A History of Morse's Invention and Its Predecessors in the United States.

History Ottoman heliograph crew at Huj during World War I, 1917 Ruins of German Schutztruppe on top of Dikwillem, where the Germans used to have a Heliographic Station (Bird's eye view 2017) The German professor Carl Friedrich Gauss of the University of G√∂ttingen developed and used a predecessor of the heliograph (the heliotrope) in 1821. His device directed a controlled beam of sunlight to a distant station to be used as a marker for geodetic survey work, and was suggested as a means of telegraphic communications. This is the first reliably documented heliographic device, despite much speculation about possible ancient incidents of sun-flash signalling, and the documented existence of other forms of ancient optical telegraphy. For example, one author in 1919 chose to \\"hazard the theory\\" that the mainland signals Roman emperor Tiberius watched for from Capri were mirror flashes, but admitted \\"there are no references in ancient writings to the use of signaling by mirrors\\", and that the documented means of ancient long-range visual telecommunications was by beacon fires and beacon smoke, not mirrors. Similarly, the story that a shield was used as a heliograph at the Battle of Marathon is a modern myth, originating in the 1800s. Herodotus never mentioned any flash. What Herodotus did write was that someone was accused of having arranged to \\"hold up a shield as a signal\\". Suspicion grew in the 1900s that the flash theory was implausible. The conclusion after testing the theory was \\"Nobody flashed a shield at the Battle of Marathon\\". In a letter dated 3 June 1778, John Norris, High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire, England, notes: \\"Did this day heliograph intelligence from Dr [Benjamin] Franklin in Paris to Wycombe\\".Deacon, Richard (1978). The Silent War: a History of Western Naval Intelligence. David & Charles. p. 21. . However, there is little evidence that \\"heliograph\\" here is other than a misspelling of \\"holograph\\". The term \\"heliograph\\" for solar telegraphy did not enter the English language until the 1870s‚Äîeven the word \\"telegraphy\\" was not coined until the 1790s. Henry Christopher Mance (1840‚Äì1926), of the British Government Persian Gulf Telegraph Department, developed the first widely accepted heliograph about 1869 while stationed at Karachi, in the Bombay Presidency in British India. Mance was familiar with heliotropes by their use for the Great India Survey. The Mance Heliograph was operated easily by one man, and since it weighed about seven pounds, the operator could readily carry the device and its tripod. The British Army tested the heliograph in India at a range of 35 miles with favorable results. During the Jowaki Afridi expedition sent by the British-Indian government in 1877, the heliograph was first tested in war.R. W. Burns (2004) Communications: An International History of the Formative Years. Google Books. Retrieved on 2 June 2008. pp. 192-196 discuss the heliograph. US Signal Service heliograph, 1898 The simple and effective instrument that Mance invented was to be an important part of military communications for more than 60 years. The usefulness of heliographs was limited to daytimes with strong sunlight, but they were the most powerful type of visual signalling device known. In pre-radio times heliography was often the only means of communication that could span ranges of as much as 100 miles with a lightweight portable instrument. In the United States military, by mid-1878, Colonel Nelson A. Miles had established a line of heliographs connecting Fort Keogh and Fort Custer, Montana, a distance of 140 miles. In 1886, General Nelson A. Miles set up a network of 27 heliograph stations in Arizona and New Mexico during the hunt for Geronimo. In 1890, Major W. J. Volkmar of the US Army demonstrated in Arizona and New Mexico the possibility of performing communication by heliograph over a heliograph network aggregating 2,000 miles in length. The network of communication begun by General Miles in 1886, and continued by Lieutenant W. A. Glassford, was perfected in 1889 at ranges of 85, 88, 95, and 125 miles over a rugged and broken country, which was the stronghold of the Apache and other hostile Indian tribes. By 1887, heliographs in use included not only the British Mance and Begbie heliographs, but also the American Grugan, Garner and Pursell heliographs. The Grugan and Pursell heliographs used shutters, and the others used movable mirrors operated by a finger key. The Mance, Grugan and Pursell heliographs used two tripods, and the others one. The signals could either be momentary flashes, or momentary obscurations.. In 1888, the US Signal Service reviewed all of these devices, as well as the Finley Helio-Telegraph, and finding none completely suitable, developed the US Signal Service heliograph, a two-tripod, shutter-based machine of 13 7/8 lb. total weight, and ordered 100 for a total cost of $4,205.. In 1893, the number of heliographs manufactured for the US Signal Service was 133. The heyday of the heliograph was probably the Second Boer War in South Africa, where it was much used by both the British and the Boers. The terrain and climate, as well as the nature of the campaign, made heliography a logical choice. For night communications, the British used some large Aldis lamps, brought inland on railroad cars, and equipped with leaf-type shutters for keying a beam of light into dots and dashes. During the early stages of the war, the British garrisons were besieged in Kimberley, Ladysmith, and Mafeking. With land telegraph lines cut, the only contact with the outside world was via light-beam communication, helio by day, and Aldis lamps at night. In 1909, the use of heliography for forestry protection was introduced in the United States. By 1920 such use was widespread in the US and beginning in Canada, and the heliograph was regarded as \\"next to the telephone, the most useful communication device that is at present available for forest-protection services\\". D.P. Godwin of the US Forestry Service invented a very portable (4.5 lb) heliograph of the single-tripod, shutter plus mirror type for forestry use. Immediately prior to the outbreak of World War I, the cavalry regiments of the Russian Imperial Army were still being trained in heliograph communications to augment the efficiency of their scouting and reporting roles. The Red Army during the Russian Civil War made use of a series of heliograph stations to disseminate intelligence efficiently about basmachi rebel movements in Turkestan in 1926.. During World War II, South African and Australian forces used the heliograph against German forces in Libya and Egypt in 1941 and 1942. The heliograph remained standard equipment for military signallers in the Australian and British armies until the 1940s, where it was considered a \\"low probability of intercept\\" type of communication. The Canadian Army was the last major army to have the heliograph as an issue item. By the time the mirror instruments were retired, they were seldom used for signalling. However, as recently as the 1980s, heliographs were used by Afghan forces during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Signal mirrors are still included in survival kits for emergency signaling to search and rescue aircraft. Automated heliographs Most heliographs of the 19th and 20th century were completely manual. The steps of aligning the heliograph on the target, co-aligning the reflected sunbeam with the heliograph, maintaining the sunbeam alignment as the sun moved, transcribing the message into flashes, modulating the sunbeam into those flashes, detecting the flashes at the receiving end, and transcribing the flashes into the message, were all manual steps. One notable exception ‚Äì many French heliographs used clockwork heliostats to automatically steer out the sun's motion. By 1884, all active units of the \\"Mangin apparatus\\" (a dual-mode French military field optical telegraph that could use either lantern or sunlight) were equipped with clockwork heliostats. The Mangin apparatus with heliostat was still in service in 1917. Proposals to automate both the modulation of the sunbeam (by clockwork) and the detection (by electrical selenium photodetectors, or photographic means) date back to at least 1882. In 1961, the US Air Force was working on a space heliograph to signal between satellites In May 2012, \\"Solar Beacon\\" robotic mirrors designed at UC Berkeley were mounted on the towers of the Golden Gate bridge, and a web site set up where the public could schedule times for the mirrors to signal with sun-flashes, entering the time and their latitude, longitude and altitude. The solar beacons were later moved to Sather Tower at UC Berkeley. By June 2012, the public could specify a \\"custom show\\" of up to 32 \\"on\\" or \\"off\\" periods of 4 seconds each, permitting the transmission of a few characters of Morse Code. The designer described the Solar Beacon as a \\"heliostat\\", not a \\"heliograph\\". The first digitally controlled heliograph was designed and built in 2015. It was a semi-finalist in the Broadcom MASTERS competition.

It is the home ground of the Norway national football team, and the site of the Norwegian Cup Final. From its opening in 1926 to 2009 it was the home ground of FK Lyn and from 1999 to 2017 was a home ground of V√•lerenga IF. With a capacity of approximately 28,000, it is the largest football stadium in Norway. The national stadium is fully owned by the Football Association of Norway (NFF). The stadium opened on 26 September 1926 as the home ground for Lyn and several other local teams. The first international match was played in 1927, and NFF started gradually purchasing part of the stadium company. The peak attendance dates from 1935, when 35,495 people saw Norway play Sweden. Since 1948, Ullevaal has hosted the finals of the Norwegian Football Cup, and in 1967 the Japp Stand was completed. A new renovation started with the completion of the single-tier West Stand in 1985, and continued with the two- tier North and East Stands in 1990 and the South Stand in 1998. Ullevaal hosted the finals of the UEFA Women's Euro in 1987 and 1997. In conjunction with the stadium is the head office of many sports federations, a bandy field, and commercial property including a conference center, hotel and shopping mall. The stadium is located adjacent to Ullev√•l Stadion Station of the Oslo Metro and the Ring 3 motorway. Plans call to replace the West Stand to increase capacity to 30,000 and perhaps add a retractable roof and artificial turf.  History  The stadium in 1935 Construction and early years The first suggestions for a stadium at Ullevaal were launched by members of Lyn in 1917, but not until 1924 was a committee appointed to look into the matter. Lyn had also considered building their stadium at Holmenkoll√•sen, Hoff, T√•sen, Frogner, Berg and Marienlyst. The club made an agreement with the tram operator Akersbanerne to purchase land they had acquired as part of the construction of the Sognsvann Line. It was decided that a limited company was to be established, with a share capital of NOK 100,000. Aker Municipality agreed to purchase 30% and partially pay via access roads and utilities. All sports clubs in Aker were given the right to purchase up to 10% of the shares, while the rest was to be bought by Lyn. Any costs exceeding the capital was to be paid for through loans and donations. At the same time, Lyn acquired land to build a training field which they would own themselves and was estimated to cost NOK 20,000. Both plans were passed by the club annual meeting on 23 May 1924. Spectators at a match in 1935 A/S Ullevaal Stadion was founded on 27 January 1925. The company was owned 73.5% by Lyn, 24% Aker Municipality and 5.1% by the clubs Ullevaal, T√•sen, Nydalen and Heming. The stadium was built with a running track, allowing the stadium to also be used for track and field, and had a capacity of about 35,000 spectators. The stadium cost NOK 416,000. The grand opening was held on 26 September 1926 by Crown Prince Olav. It was followed by a friendly match between a reinforced Lyn and √ñrgryte IS of Sweden, where Lyn won 5‚Äì1. In the opening game, tickets cost NOK 3 for seats, NOK 2 for standing places and NOK 1 on the end stands. The stadium became both the home ground for Lyn and hosted track and field events. The first international match was held on 29 May 1927 and featured Norway losing 0‚Äì1 against Denmark. The match against Sweden from the Nordic Football Championship 1933/36 on 22 September 1935 was held in front of a crowd of 35,495, which still stands as the spectator record. The stadium was served by the Oslo Metro with the opening of the Sognsvann Line in 1934. In 1938, a new East Stand (Klokkesvingen) was opened. Ullevaal in 1965 The Football Association bought Aker's share of the stadium during the 1930s, and in 1945 also part of Lyn's share. From 1948, the Cup Final was held at Ullevaal, and has been held there since. Other activities held during the first decades included boxing, and a revival meeting hosted by Billy Graham in front of 40,000 people in 1955. In 1960, NFF bought more shares from Lyn and became the majority shareholder with 50.7%, while Lyn retained 44.2%. The reason was the planned expansion could not receive public grants with such a strong tie to a single club, but the state was willing to give grants to the stadium if it was controlled by the federation. In 1967, a new South Stand was opened, and the following year NFF moved into offices at the stadium. Two-tier upgrades In the early 1980s, the owner company presented plans for an upgraded stadium, which would have capacity for 40,000 spectators, of which 25,000 would be seated and 15,000 would stand. In 1984, a new pitch was installed. The first renovation was an all-new West Stand, which would be single-tier and have capacity for 8,800 spectators, of which 3,800 could be seated under a roof. Costs were estimated at NOK 56 million. The costs were covered by Sogn N√¶ringsbygg, who built the stands and then received free ground to build of commercial real estate. Because of the height, the new stand was met with protests from locals who felt the six-story structure would wreck the idyllic neighborhood. The stand was completed in 1985. On 14 June 1987, Ullevaal was the host of the final of the 1987 European Competition for Women's Football, where Norway beat Sweden 2‚Äì0 in front of 8,408 spectators. Plans for a new two-tier stand to the north and east were presented next. The plans had called for 24,500 sitting places in the new and south stands, and 5,500 standing places in the west stand. However, in 1989, the plans were modified, as the FIFA made new rules, requiring that only seating places could be used for international qualification matches from 1992. It was thereby decided that Ullevaal would become an all-seater. The renovations included a new turf with under-soil heating, luxury boxes, VIP-seating, a section for the Royal Family, new change rooms and of restaurant and meeting area. The upgrade involved the removal of the running track, making Ullevaal a pure football stadium. Construction of the two stands started after the cup final in November 1989, and started with the demolishing of the north stand from 1926 and the east stand from 1938. After construction was completed, Lyn played its first home game on Ullevaal for the season on 13 September 1990, after having played most of the season in the Second Division at Voldsl√∏kka Stadion. The construction included of commercial properties built beneath the stands. Total investment costs for the new stands and commercial area was NOK 350 million, of which NOK 100 million was for the stands. Plans for a NOK 40-million underground squash court were discarded. NFF and Lyn dispute In 1993, Lyn was in deep financial difficulties after having been promoted to the Elite League after the 1991 season. To create additional liquidity, the club sold its 44% share in Ullevaal to the Football Association for NOK 4.4 million in January 1993. At the same time, NFF bought the 5.1% stake owned by the other clubs, making NFF the sole owner of the stadium. In October, the limited company Lyn Fotball AS was founded to take over the elite football teams in Lyn. At the same time, the club announced that it planned to purchase back their shares in Ullevaal Stadion, by letting the club take up a loan. V√•lerenga supporters on the North Stand, which opened in 1990 In November, Lyn stated that they wanted to purchases the shares in Ullevaal from NFF, who stated that they were now worth NOK 10 million. NFF also raised questions if it was actually Lyn or the newly created limited company who were actually going to buy the shares. NFF stated that they were opposed to anyone but the federation and clubs owning the national stadium and that they were opposed to private investors. The federation hoped to use the high incomes generated from the recent success of the national team, including from participation in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, to allow the stadium company to charge high rent for the international matches and Cup Finals, thus quickly eliminating the stadium's debt. NFF felt it was unfair that they were in practice subsidizing Lyn by not having similar rent increases for the club, and that this should be reflected in the share value. In March 1994, Lyn sued NFF for the right to purchase the shares for NOK 4.4 million plus interest. In May, it was stated that the matter would not be handled in the courts, but instead by the Football Association's Tribunal, with the possibility to appeal to the Norwegian Confederation of Sports' Tribunal. This was because FIFA's regulations forbade a club form suing their own federation. In January 1995, the tribunal decided that Lyn had the right to purchase the shares for NOK 4.4 million plus interest. By February, it became clear that Lyn did not have sufficient liquidity to purchase the shares. In December 1995, three months before the purchase option became invalid, the club bought back the shares. In 2001, it became clear that Lyn had given false information about the deal, and that the club had signed an agreement with Lyn Fotball AS which was later criticized by club members as a \\"raid\\" by the investors to secure the main asset in Lyn. The loan had a high interest rate and had clauses that made a refinancing expensive, it gave the investors a right of pre-emption for the shares, the right for the investors to terminate the load on short notice, and the right for the investors to take over the shares should the club not be able to manage the debt. In February 1996, Lyn and NFF stated that they had agreed that Lyn would sell their shares in Ullevaal to NFF for about NOK 5 to 6 million, plus support for Lyn's new training facility at Kringsj√•. The parties stated that with the plans for expanding and making new investments in Ullevaal, Lyn's lack of financial backing would become a hindrance for financing the projects and that the sale would allow Lyn to concentrate on playing football. On 25 March, NFF and Lyn stated the sale was terminated by NFF, because it was considered too lucrative for Lyn by other clubs in Norway. In 1996, the stadium featured a cross- country skiing event with 5,500 spectators. On 12 July 1997, Ullevaal was the host of the final of the UEFA Women's Euro 1997, where Germany beat Italy 2‚Äì0 in front of 2,221 spectators. The South Stand (right) was built to meld seamlessly with the older East (VG) Stand. In 1997, NFF and Lyn agreed to renovate and expand the stadium. The plans called for new stands which would increase the capacity to 30,000 spectators. The size of the field would be reduced by , from to to make the stadium more intimate. The new grass would be lowered , allowing two more rows of chairs to be added. The South Stand (Japp) would be demolished and a new two-tier stand would be built, in the same style as the northern and eastern stands. This would give three sides two-tier height, although the western stand would remain single-tier. The South Stand received 30 luxury boxes and press quarters for 192 people. The project involved the demolishing of the four light masts and instead installing the lights along the roof. The cost of the whole project was estimated at NOK 300 million. The project also included of commercial real estate, to be located behind the south stands. Because public grants of about NOK 90 million could only be given to non-profit entities, the ownership of the stadium was split in two. The stands and other core areas of the stadium remained owned by the stadium company, while a separate company was created to own the commercial areas. NFF wanted the profits from the commercial company to go to the stadium company to pay for operating expenses, while Lyn wanted the profits to be paid as dividend to the owners so Lyn could pay interests on their debt. Construction started in January 1998, after Lyn had lost a court case regarding the dividend structure. The Norwegian Olympic Committee and Confederation of Sports, including the federations for many smaller sports, chose to move to Ullevaal and establish their offices in conjunction with the stadium, in Dr√•pen located at the south side. The Norwegian Football Museum was established and received in the southern stand building. South Stand During construction in 1998, Lyn and the national team played their games at Bislett Stadion‚Äîthe home venue for V√•lerenga‚Äîwhile Ullevaal was being rebuilt. Prior to the 1999 season, where Lyn would have to play in the First Division, Lyn applied to play all their matches at Bislett to cut rental costs at Ullevaal. However, this was rejected by the municipality, who owned Bislett, because there was not vacant capacity at Bislett. V√•lerenga enters In late 1998, V√•lerenga considered moving their matches to Ullevaal from 1999. Although they stated that they had a better economic proposal from Ullevaal, the team stayed at Bislett to have more influence on the design of the new stadium that would replace the existing structure. Oslo's other Premier League team, Skeid Fotball, stated that they had also considered playing at Ullevaal, but wanted to keep the more \\"intimate feeling\\" at Voldsl√∏kka Stadion. However, V√•lerenga were forced to move some of their 1999 matches to Ullevaal because the dilapidated standards at Bislett. Prior to the 2000 season, V√•lerenga signed a three-year contract with Ullevaal, making the national stadium their home. In 2000, Ullevaal Stadion AS bought the West Stand, including the commercial areas. In March 2001, NFF gave Lyn a loan for NOK 12.5 million, on the condition that if it was not paid back within two years, NFF would take over Lyn's ownership in the stadium. This made it possible for Lyn to pay their investment company back the debt for the loan, which had increased to this amount in five years, and to purchase the stadium and secure NFF the right of pre-emption. On 4 July 2002, Lyn and NFF announced that NFF would make a private placement of NOK 27 million in Ullevaal Stadion AS and at the same time terminate Lyn's debt. In exchange, Lyn's ownership was reduced to 15%. Concert with Green Day in 2010 In 1998, Vital Forsikring bought the real estate located between the east of the stadium, Ring 3 and the Sognsvann Line. The lot covered , including the commercial properties under the stands. A new zoning plan was rejected by the municipality in 2000, but in 2005 the plans were passed. In 2008, Vital started constructing a hotel and more commercial spaces at the site. The hotel had 144 rooms and would be operated by Thon Hotel; other investments included a congress hall for 800 people and a reconstruction of the sports facility Bergbanen. Total area was , including for the congress center, for the four-story hotel, and a expansion of the shopping center by. The shopping center area thus became . The investments cost NOK 550 million and were scheduled for completion in 2009. The project also included the bandy field Bergbanen and a new club building for Ullev√•l IL. Ownership of the bandy venue was transferred to the municipality. Norway playing England in 2012 On 23 October 2005, V√•lerenga set its attendance record of 24,894 in a league match against Rosenborg BK. On 23 March 2007, NFF bought Lyn's remaining 13.07% share of Ullevaal, securing the federation full control of the national stadium. Lyn was paid NOK 32.5 million for the transaction. Following Lyn's relegation from the Norwegian Premier League after the 2009 season, the club decided to move its home games from Ullevaal to Bislett. This was to avoid the high costs that the club had renting Ullevaal, which cost the club NOK 150,000 per game, compared to a similar fee per season at Bislett. Lyn played its last home game at Ullevaal on 3 November, when it lost 0‚Äì5 against Fredrikstad FK. In the 2009 season of the Premier League, V√•lerenga had the fourth-highest average attendance at 10,788, while Lyn had the lowest at 4,187. Lyn's least-seen game attracted 2,092 people. After it was decided that the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 was to be held at Stab√¶k's home venue Telenor Arena, Stab√¶k was forced to rent Ullevaal to play three of its home games during April and May 2010. In a 2012 survey carried out by the Norwegian Players' Association among away-team captains, Ullevaal was found to be the league's best stadium, with a score of 4,47 on a scale from one to five. Facilities Changing room The stadium is owned by AS Ullevaal Stadion, a limited company wholly owned by the Norwegian Football Association. Operations of the stadium is performed by the subsidiary Ullevaal Stadion Idrett AS, while the NFF-owned Ullevaal Business Class AS (UBC) is responsible for operating the luxury boxes, the conference center and VIP- services. The commercial area in the North and East Stands, plus that located north and east of the stadium, is owned by Vital Forsikring. The stadium has a capacity of 25,572 spectators, of which 1,470 are VIP seats and 28 are for wheelchair users. There are four stands: to the north the Postbanken Stand, to the west the VG Stand, to the south the Hafslund Stand and to the west the Bendit Stand. The stadium has 16 entrances with 40 counters, five VIP entrances, one ticket office with twelve booths, 40 toilets, 20 kiosks and three emergency rooms. The stadium building is long and the height of the roof is . The sound system provides 66,000 watts, and the flood lighting has 160 lamps that give 1,400 lux. Ullevaal Business Class offers 29 boxes and 1,418 VIP seats directly accessible from the boxes. In addition, in part in conjunction with the hotel, UBC has a number of conference rooms, of which the largest can hold 800 people. The pitch is , and the area within the stands is , of which grass covers . The grass is a combination of Lolium perenne, Poa pratensis and Poa annua, with 3% artificial grass sown inn. The pitch features a sprinkler system and under-soil heating with an effect of 750 kW located under the surface. The pitch has a plastic cover which can cover the full size and which, powered by a fan, hoovers above the ground. The stadium seen from afar, with the West Stand to the left The stadium contains of press room, a television studio, 16 commentator boxes and of working space for journalists. There is a photography room, a separate section for photographers on the stand, and a press conference room with place for 96 people. All the press facilities are in the South Stand. There are similar facilities in the North Stand, allowing a television team from the opposing nation to make a double production. They can film and send with advertisements from the other side of the stadium and thus increase advertisement income. Both NFF, the Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports and many sports federations have their head offices at Ullevaal. At Ullevaal is the Norwegian Football Museum, which offers tours of the stadium. Just east of the stadium is Bergbanen, a municipal bandy field used by Ullev√•l IL. The field is located on top of a parking house. NFF owns and Vital owns of commercial property at Ullevaal, including a shopping center and office space. Transport Ullev√•l stadion of the Oslo Metro The stadium is located next to the Ullev√•l stadion station of the Oslo Metro, and is served by lines 3, 4 and 5 (the Sognsvann Line and the Ring Line). The stadium is also within a ten-minute walk from Rikshospitalet station of the Oslo Tramway, located on the Ullev√•l Hageby Line and served by trams 17 and 18. In addition, the motorway Ring 3 runs nearby. Parking is available at Rikshospitalet, Domus Atletica and Sogn Upper Secondary School; these are within a five minutes walk. Future In 2005, NFF launched plans for a redevelopment of Ullevaal, including artificial turf, a retractable roof and redevelopment of the West Stand to increase total capacity to 30,500 spectators. The combination of the three would allow Ullevaal to become a multi-purpose venue and allow more matches to be played, grant the teams more practice time on their home pitch, make room for sponsor events, allow more concerts and potentially allow non-football sports, such as sprint skiing, to be held. V√•lerenga playing Liverpool in 2011 To make it easier to attract good international teams, the management of Ullevaal considered coordinating the laying of artificial turf with Parken Stadium in Copenhagen and R√•sunda Fotbollstadion in Stockholm, the home of the Danish and Swedish national teams, respectively. Plans for artificial turf were rejected by both Lyn and V√•lerenga, who both threatened to move elsewhere should the stadium install artificial turf. Commentators have stated that among older footballers there is opposition against artificial turf, but that long Norwegian winters cause pitches to be extremely bad during the early parts of the season. It has been argued that younger Norwegian players are used to artificial turf and that in the future they will need better pitches to play \\"finer\\" football. In 2010, seven of sixteen premiership stadiums used artificial turf; commentators have stated that if Ullevaal converted, it could be a pivoting point for other clubs to do the same. V√•lerenga has stated that they want to relocate and have conducted plans to build a new stadium at Valle Hovin, where the club currently have their administration and training facilities. Plans exist for stadiums for 22,000 spectators, which would be expandable to 32,000. Part of the rationale for their own stadium is that V√•lerenga traditionally is the east side team, while Ullevaal is located in the heart of the west side. As an alternative, V√•lerenga has considered moving back to Bislett, at least as a temporary solution. NFF has launched plans for a new national football stadium. Inspired by the new Friends Arena to be built in Stockholm, a new venue would have a capacity for 52,000 spectators and was part of the joint Norwegian‚ÄìSwedish bid for UEFA Euro 2016. To finance a new stadium, NFF would have to sell Ullevaal. NFF stated that expanding Ullevaal beyond 31,000 spectators would be excessively expensive and that the location poses limitations in transport infrastructure to handle so large crowds. In 2008, Ullevaal, including the of commercial area owned by NFF, was valued to about NOK 1 billion, of which the commercial area was valuated at NOK 750 million. In 2006, Ullevaal Stadion AS had NOK 522 million in debt.

He was born on a farm near Stanstead, Quebec. After a group of Nez Perce and Bitterroot Salish men journeyed to St. Louis requesting the Book of Heaven in 1831 (their people had heard of it years before), Lee and his nephew Daniel Lee volunteered to serve as missionaries for them. Both were appointed as missionaries by the church, given orders to open and maintain a mission among the Salish. At the time, the Pacific Northwest was \\"jointly occupied\\" by the United Kingdom and the United States as agreed to in the Treaty of 1818. The missionaries went overland in 1834 with Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth, an American merchant who previously visited the Columbia River basin to enter the regional fur trade market. The party of priests and fur trappers arrived at Fort Vancouver later that year and were greeted by Chief Factor John McLoughlin. While there, McLoughlin influenced Jason Lee to open the station among the Kalapuya in the Willamette Valley rather than the Salish. Jason Lee was the first of the Oregon missionaries and instrumental in the American settlement in the Oregon Country. Early life Jason Lee was the youngest of fourteen siblings. At the age of 13 Lee was self-supporting, converted to Methodism at 23 and later attended the Wilbraham Wesleyan Academy. While studying there, he became friends with Osman Baker and graduated in 1830. Between 1830 and 1832 he was minister in the Stanstead area and taught school. Lee had applied to the London-based Weslyan Missionary Society to proselytize to the First Nations of Canada but his application wasn't processed as Richard Watson, the secretary had died. Missionary Jason Lee's mission in 1834 In 1832, four men of the Nez Perce and Bitterroot Salish or Flathead tribe journeyed to St. Louis and requested from resident William Clark for someone to bring the \\"Book of Heaven\\", prophesied in a vision, to the Salish people. An account was editorialized by the Christian Advocate and Journal the subsequent year, calling upon its readers to send preachers to the Rocky Mountains and beyond. The article quickly was given the attention of Wilbur Fisk, President of the Wesleyan University, who tabled a proposal for the Methodist Church to establish a presence among the Salish. Jason Lee, a former student of Fisk, and his nephew Daniel volunteered for service in the planned mission among the Flathead Indians. Arrangements were made with Nathaniel Wyeth for the small missionary group to travel with his party. In early 1834 the combined group departed from Independence, Missouri. Lee didn't refrain from judging and comparing the various native cultures along the Columbia River basin while en route west. He found the Walla Walla in particular \\"far more filthy and indolent than the Kioos Cayuse.\\" The close to two thousand mile trek ended at the Hudson's Bay Company's (HBC) fur trading station of Fort Vancouver, where the missionaries wintered. During their stay there Chief Factor John McLoughlin advised against creating a mission in interior Flathead land and instead recommended the nearby Willamette Valley. Lee eventually settled on a location northwest of the present site of Salem, Oregon. There he found about a dozen French-Canadian settlers who previously had been employed by the HBC, in addition to their native wives and children. Conversion efforts Over time the superintendent began to request additional missionaries and laymen be sent to relieve him of temporal duties. This view was shared by Daniel Lee and later missionaries, all of whom complained of having to spend too much time away from conversion efforts. Additionally Lee downplayed the accounts from fellow priests by proclaiming that hundreds of natives had become Methodists. It wasn't until the arrival of George Abernethy in 1840 that Lee was finally allowed to focus solely on proselyting to indigenous peoples. Lee also highlighted that the indigenous populations were on the decline from disease in 1836: \\"unless the God of heaven undertake their cause, they must perish from off the face of the Earth, and their name blotted out from under heaven.\\" This became a typical view of Lee despite his continued conversion efforts. According to his biographer Brosnan, Lee saw \\"Oregon as the home of a future white civilization\\" as early as 1837 while back in New York. In a letter addressed to the Methodist Missionary Board he beseeched for agriculturalists. Lee felt that because \\"this country will settle ere long,\\" if the board were to send \\"a few good, pious settlers\\" then \\"an incalculable benefit\\" would benefit \\"generations yet unborn.\\" Political activities Oregon Country Temperance efforts Lee formed the Oregon Temperance Society in 1836, composed of lay members of the Mission and former HBC employees. Blocked out of the local fur trade by the HBC, pioneer Ewing Young began plans to create an alcohol distillery for sale to natives. Once this became known to the Society its members were mobilized into action. In a letter signed by residents of the valley, Young was requested to refrain from opening the distillery and offered to cover the costs of forfeiting the venture. Young blamed the HBC for \\"tyranizing oppression\\" and the situation he was in but nonetheless agreed to forfeit production of alcohol without compensation. Willamette Cattle Company The first representative from the United States to visit the Methodist station was Navy Lieutenant William A. Slacum on board the Loriot. John McLoughlin welcomed the naval official and informed Jason Lee of his arrival, who met Slacum at Champoeg in January. A common topic Slacum had with French-Canadian and American settlers residing in the Willamette Valley was about livestock. All the cattle residing in Oregon at the time was then owned by the HBC. Despite this, McLoughlin authorized the loaning out of livestock as needed to missionaries and settlers. To resolve this pressing issue, Slacum suggested that cattle from Alta California be purchased. The Willamette Cattle Company was formed and the Loriot gave passage to Young and other men to California. Returning overland with a herd of 600 livestock, the portion for Lee and the Mission bestowed a sound means of nutritional self-sufficiently. Promoting a settler authority Ewing Young became the center of attention of the Willamette Valley farmsteads once again with his death and his extensive estate, which had no heirs to claim it in 1841 Several meetings were held and Lee chaired the first one where he put forth a proposal for a singular jurisdiction for all inhabitants south of the Columbia river. This was the culmination of feuds with Vicar General Blanchet who had till then dispensed justice on the Catholic population of the Willamette Valley. Blanchet was accused by Lee of splitting the settler community by refusing to submit to the attempted civic authority. This attempt was aimed at cutting the financially supportive relationship and patronage the HBC gave the Catholic Missionaries. By removing the political control over Catholics, the Company would lose influence among the settlers. An additional motive was that the Oregon Mission was in debt to the Company. These were the roots of Lee's support for a government in 1841, rather than finding a local regime necessary in and of itself. At the time of the Champoeg Meetings Lee was no longer an active participant of the political activities in the valley. By this point noted a biographer, \\"Jason's Lee acumen made him realize that a local provisional government was not the direction that lay Oregon's true interest.\\" Abernethy joined Lee in criticizing the Champoeg Meetings and their developments as unnecessary. 1838 trip East The delays in communication with the Board of Managers back in the United States eventually necessitated Lee to return there to give a more thorough description of the activities of the Mission. Prior to leaving he was influential in the propagation of a memorial by many residents of the Willamette Valley addressing the United States Congress. The document requested that the American government establish rule over the regions of the Oregon Country south of the Columbia River and highlighted the potentials of trade with Asia and the Pacific. Besides gathering funds for missionary work, Lee apparently left for the east as he had a \\"desire to promote\\" Oregon as a worthwhile place for colonization. Lee spent three weeks at the interior ABCFM missions run by Marcus Whitman and Henry H. Spalding while waiting for an escort from the HBC. Viewing the growing farms maintained by the Cayuse and Nez Perce, Jason considered them both \\"superior to those upon the Willamette [River] ...\\" despite the occasional whipping by the two missionaries. After giving birth to their child, both his wife, Anna Maria Pittman Lee, and their infant died in June. News of this reached Lee as he entered Missouri, who soon remarried to Lucy Thompson Grubbs. While traveling through Illinois, Lee convinced John P. Richmond to join him in Oregon, later being appointed as the head of the Nisqually Mission in modern Washington. While in Peoria he held a speech on Oregon that enthralled some locals who formed the Peoria Party to attempt to colonizing Oregon. At a meeting with the Missionary Board in November the Board approved his plan for the creation of recruiting laymen such as blacksmiths and mechanics, the creation of grist mill, and expansion of agricultural production. After the memorial arrived in Washington D.C. it was presented to Congress by Senator Lewis F. Linn in January 1839\\\\. In correspondence with Representative Caleb Cushing Lee noted that if America were to control the area many of the laymen of the Mission would in time become permanent settlers, which did eventually occur as predicted. During his time in the United States Lee went on several speaking tours throughout the nation along with a visit to his hometown in Canada to raise funds for the mission. Despite his position that only two additional preachers were needed, the Board recruited five. Lee and the \\"great reinforcement\\" sailed aboard the Lausanne and arrived in Oregon on 1 June 1840. Dismissal Letters were sent to the Board of Managers from Elijah White, John P. Richmond, Gustavus Hines attacking the leadership of Lee for several years. Conflict with White had been a source of discontent for years, who previously managed the mission financial records. White was accused by Lee for having spent money at Fort Vancouver on the account of the mission and rather than show his records, he left for the United States in 1841. While David Leslie gave the superintendent a positive appraisal, it wasn't enough to counter the years of criticisms. Reports held Lee accountable for a general neglect and disinterest in converting Indigenous peoples. Additionally, Lee's inability to provide a complete financial history of the Willamette Mission and its subsidiary stations proved to be too much for the Board. They appointed Rev. George Gray as the new superintendent and instructed him to dispose of the temporal properties of the Mission, including the grist mill and missions not actively used. After hearing the news that he was ejected as the superintendent from Marcus Whitman, who recently returned from the United States, Lee went to meet the Board in person to defend himself. Crossing Mexico and sailing up the Mississippi River, Lee reached New York City on 27 May 1844. He found the leadership debating over slavery, which soon led to a schism and the formation of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. In the meantime, Lee went to Washington D.C. and had conferences with both President John Tyler and Senator Thomas H. Benton to present the land claims of the Oregon Mission. When finally meeting with the Board leadership Lee was able to rectify his position but he wasn't reappointed as superintendent. He opted to raise money for the Oregon Institute, (now Willamette University), a school he helped organize. However while visiting his sister in Stanstead, his health failed, and he died on 12 March 1845. His remains were reinterred at the Lee Mission Cemetery in Salem, Oregon in 1906 alongside the remains of his two wives and infant daughter. Legacy NSHC statue The house Lee occupied in 1841 is preserved as part of the Willamette Heritage Center, formerly known as the Mission Mill Museum. In 1953, the State of Oregon donated a bronze statue of Lee to the U.S. Capitol's National Statuary Hall Collection. Another copy was installed on the grounds of the Oregon State Capitol in 1953, having been finished by Gifford MacGregor Proctor after the death of his father, sculptor Alexander Phimister Proctor. Elementary schools in Richland, Washington, and Portland, Oregon and middle schools in Vancouver, Washington, and Tacoma, Washington are named after him.

The Placozoa is a basal group of multicellular animals (metazoa). Trichoplax are very flat organisms around a millimetre in diameter, lacking any organs or internal structures. They have two cellular layers: the top epitheloid layer is made of ciliated \\"cover cells\\" flattened toward the outside of the organism, and the bottom layer is made up of cylinder cells that possess cilia used in locomotion, and gland cells that lack cilia. Between these layers is the fibre syncytium, a liquid-filled cavity strutted open by star-like fibres. Trichoplax feed by absorbing food particles‚Äîmainly microbes‚Äîwith their underside. They generally reproduce asexually, by dividing or budding, but can also reproduce sexually. Though Trichoplax has a small genome in comparison to other animals, nearly 87% of its 11,514 predicted protein-coding genes are identifiably similar to known genes in other animals. Discovery Trichoplax was discovered in 1883 by the German zoologist Franz Eilhard Schulze, in a seawater aquarium at the Zoological Institute in Graz, Austria. The generic name is derived from the classical Greek ('), \\"hair\\", and ('), \\"plate\\". The specific epithet adhaerens comes from Latin \\"adherent\\", reflecting its propensity to stick to the glass slides and pipettes used in its examination. Although from the very beginning most researchers who studied Trichoplax in any detail realized that it had no close relationship to other animal phyla, the zoologist Thilo Krumbach published a hypothesis that Trichoplax is a form of the planula larva of the anemone-like hydrozoan Eleutheria krohni in 1907. Although this was refuted in print by Schulze and others, Krumbach's analysis became the standard textbook explanation, and nothing was printed in zoological journals about Trichoplax until the 1960s. In the 1960s and 1970s a new interest among researchers led to acceptance of Placozoa as a new animal phylum. Among the new discoveries was study of the early phases of the animals' embryonic development and evidence that the animals that people had been studying are adults, not larvae. This newfound interest also included study of the organism in nature (as opposed to aquariums). Morphology Trichoplax generally has a thinly flattened, plate-like body in cross-section around half a millimetre, occasionally up to two or three millimetres. The body is usually only about 25 ¬µm thick. These colorlessly gray organisms are so thin they are transparent when illuminated from behind, and in most cases are barely visible to the naked eye. Like the single-celled amoebae, which they superficially resemble, they continually change their external shape. In addition, spherical phases occasionally form. These may facilitate movement to new habitats. Trichoplax lacks tissues and organs; there is also no manifest body symmetry, so it is not possible to distinguish anterior from posterior or left from right. It is made up of a few thousand cells of six types in three distinct layers: dorsal epithelia cells and ventral epithelia cells, each with a single cilium (\\"monociliate\\"), ventral gland cells, syncytial fiber cells, lipophils, and crystal cells (each containing a birefringent crystal, arrayed around the rim). Lacking sensory and muscle cells, it moves using cilia on its external surface. Signal processing There are no neurons present, but in the absence of a nervous system the animal use short chains of amino acids known as peptides for cell communication, in a way that resembles how animals with neurons use neuropeptides for the same purpose. Individual cells contain and secrete a variety of small peptides, made up of between four and 20 amino acids, which are detected by neighbouring cells. Each peptide can be used individually to send a signal to other cells, but also sequentially or together in different combinations, creating a huge number a different types of signals. This allows for a relatively complex behavior such as crinkling, turning, flattening, and internal churning.Before nerves, there were peptides - Cosmos Magazine Epitheloid Both structurally and functionally, it is possible to distinguish a back or dorsal side from a belly or ventral side in Trichoplax adhaerens. Both consist of a single layer of cells coated on the outside with slime and are reminiscent of epithelial tissue, primarily due to the junctions‚Äîbelt desmosomes‚Äîbetween the cells. In contrast to true epithelium, however, the cell layers of the Placozoa possess no basal lamina, which refers to a thin layer of extracellular material underlying epithelium that stiffens it and separates it from the body's interior. The absence of this structure, which is otherwise to be found in all animals except the sponges, can be explained in terms of function: a rigid separating layer would make the amoeboid changes in the shape of Trichoplax adhaerens impossible. Instead of an epithelium, therefore, we speak of an epitheloid in the Placozoa. A mature individual consists of up to a thousand cells that can be divided into four different cell types. The monociliated cells of the dorsal epitheloid are flattened and contain lipid bodies. The cells on the ventral side likewise beat just a single cilium, but their elongated columnar form of small cross section at the surface packs them very close together, causing the cilia to be very closely spaced on the ventral side and to form a ciliated \\"crawling sole\\". Between them are found unciliated gland cells thought to be capable of synthesizing digestive enzymes. Fibre syncytium Between the two layers of cells is a liquid-filled interior space, which, except for the immediate zones of contact with the ventral and dorsal sides, is pervaded by a star-shaped fibre syncytium: a fibrous network that consists essentially of a single cell but contains numerous nuclei that, while separated by internal crosswalls (septa), do not have true cell membranes between them. Similar structures are also found in the sponges (Porifera) and many fungi. On both sides of the septa are liquid-filled capsules that cause the mentioned separating structures to resemble synapses, i.e. nerve-cell junctions that occur in fully expressed form only in animals with tissues (Eumetazoa). Striking accumulations of calcium ions, which may have a function related to the propagation of stimuli, likewise suggest a possible role as protosynapses. This view is supported by the fact that fluorescent antibodies against cnidarian neurotransmitters, i.e. precisely those signal carriers that are transferred in synapses, bind in high concentrations in certain cells of Trichoplax adhaerens and thus indicate the existence of comparable substances in the Placozoa. In addition, the fibre syncytium contains molecules of actin and probably also of myosin, which occur in the muscle cells of eumetazoans . In the placozoans, they ensure that the individual fibres can relax or contract and thus help determine the animals' shape. In this way, the fibre syncytium assumes the functions of nerve and muscle tissues. Moreover, at least a portion of digestion occurs here. On the other hand, no gelatinous extracellular matrix exists of the kind observed, as mesoglea, in cnidarians and ctenophores. Pluripotent cells, which can differentiate into other cell types, have not yet been demonstrated unambiguously in T. adhaerens, in contrast to the case of the Eumetazoa. The conventional view is that dorsal and ventral epithelium cells arise only from their own kind. Genetics The Trichoplax genome contains about 98 million base pairs and 11,514 predicted protein-coding genes. All nuclei of placozoan cells contain six pairs of chromosomes that are only about two to three micrometres in size. Three pairs are metacentric, meaning that the centromere, the attachment point for the spindle fibers in cell division, is located at the center, or acrocentric, with the centromere at an extreme end of each chromosome. The cells of the fiber syncytium can be tetraploid, i.e. contain a quadruple complement of chromosomes. A single complement of chromosomes in Trichoplax adhaerens contains a total of fewer than fifty million base pairs and thus forms the smallest animal genome; the number of base pairs in the intestinal bacterium Escherichia coli is smaller by a factor of only ten. The genetic complement of Trichoplax adhaerens has not yet been very well researched; it has, however, already been possible to identify several genes, such as Brachyury and TBX2/TBX3, which are homologous to corresponding base-pair sequences in eumetazoans. Of particular significance is Trox-2, a placozoan gene known under the name Cnox-2 in cnidarians and as Gsx in the bilaterally symmetrical Bilateria. As a homeobox or Hox gene it plays a role in organization and differentiation along the axis of symmetry in the embryonic development of eumetazoans; in cnidarians, it appears to determine the position of mouth- facing (oral) and opposite-facing (aboral) sides of the organism. Since placozoans possess no axes of symmetry, exactly where the gene is transcribed in the body of Trichoplax is of special interest. Antibody studies have been able to show that the gene's product occurs only in the transition zones of the dorsal and ventral sides, perhaps in a fifth cell type that has not yet been characterized. It is not yet clear whether these cells, contrary to traditional views, are stem cells, which play a role in cell differentiation. In any case, Trox-2 can be considered a possible candidate for a proto-Hox gene, from which the other genes in this important family could have arisen through gene duplication and variation. Initially, molecular-biology methods were applied unsuccessfully to test the various theories regarding Placozoa's position in the Metazoa system. No clarification was achieved with standard markers such as 18S rDNA/RNA: the marker sequence was apparently \\"garbled\\", i.e. rendered uninformative as the result of many mutations. Nevertheless, this negative result supported the suspicion that Trichoplax might represent an extremely primitive lineage of metazoans, since a very long period of time had to be assumed for the accumulation of so many mutations. Of the 11,514 genes identified in the six chromosomes of Trichoplax, 87% are identifiably similar to genes in cnidarians and bilaterians. In those Trichoplax genes for which equivalent genes can be identified in the human genome, over 80% of the introns (the regions within genes that are removed from RNA molecules before their sequences are translated in protein synthesis) are found in the same location as in the corresponding human genes. The arrangement of genes in groups on chromosomes is also conserved between the Trichoplax and human genomes. This contrasts to other model systems such as fruit flies and soil nematodes that have experienced a paring down of non-coding regions and a loss of the ancestral genome organizations.Primitive Pancake at Phyorg.com, Based on a DOE/Joint Genome Institute news release. Aug 30, 2008 Relationship with animals The phylogenetic relationship between Trichoplax and other animals has been debated for some time. A variety of hypotheses have been advanced based on the few morphological characteristics of this simple organism that could be identified. More recently, a comparison of the Trichoplax mitochondrial genome suggested that Trichoplax is a basal metazoan‚Äîless closely related to all other animals including sponges than they are to each other. This implies that the Placozoa would have arisen relatively soon after the evolutionary transition from unicellular to multicellular forms. But an even more recent analysis of the much larger Trichoplax nuclear genome instead supports the hypothesis that Trichoplax is a basal eumetazoan, that is, more closely related to Cnidaria and other animals than any of those animals are to sponges. This is consistent with the presence in Trichoplax of cell layers reminiscent of epithelial tissue (see above). Distribution and habitat Trichoplax was first discovered on the walls of a marine aquarium, and is rarely observed in its natural habitat. Trichoplax has been collected, among other places, in the Red Sea, the Mediterranean, and the Caribbean, off Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, Japan, Vietnam, Brazil, and Papua New Guinea, and on the Great Barrier Reef off the east coast of Australia. Field specimens tend to be found in the coastal tidal zones of tropical and subtropical seas, on such substrates as the trunks and roots of mangroves, shells of molluscs, fragments of stony corals or simply on pieces of rock. One study was able to detect seasonal population fluctuations, the causes of which have not yet been deduced. Feeding and symbionts Extracorporeal food uptake by Trichoplax adhaerens Trichoplax adhaerens feeds on small algae, particularly on green algae (Chlorophyta) of the genus Chlorella, cryptomonads (Cryptophyta) of the genera Cryptomonas and Rhodomonas, and blue-green bacteria (Cyanobacteria) such as Phormidium inundatum, but also on detritus from other organisms. In feeding, one or several small pockets form around particles of nutrients on the ventral side, into which digestive enzymes are released by the gland cells; the organisms thus develop a temporary \\"external stomach\\", so to speak. The enclosed nutrients are then taken up by pinocytosis (\\"cell-drinking\\") by the ciliated cells located on the ventral surface. Entire single-celled organisms can also be ingested through the upper epitheloid (that is, the \\"dorsal surface\\" of the animal). This mode of feeding could be unique in the animal kingdom: the particles, collected in a slime layer, are drawn through the intercellular gaps (cellular interstices) of the epitheloid by the fibre cells and then digested by phagocytosis (\\"cell-eating\\"). Such \\"collecting\\" of nutrient particles through an intact tegument is only possible because some \\"insulating\\" elements (specifically, a basal lamina under the epitheloid and certain types of cell-cell junctions) are not present in the Placozoa. Not all bacteria in the interior of Placozoa are digested as food: in the endoplasmic reticulum, an organelle of the fibre syncytium, bacteria are frequently found that appear to live in symbiosis with Trichoplax adhaerens. In particular it has been proposed that there is a rickettsial endosymbiont.Driscoll T, Gillespie JJ, Nordberg EK, Azad AF, Sobral BW (2013) Bacterial DNA sifted from the Trichoplax adhaerens (Animalia:Placozoa) genome project reveals a putative rickettsial endosymbiont. Genome Biol Evol Locomotion Trichoplax movement Placozoa can move in two different ways on solid surfaces: first, their ciliated crawling sole lets them glide slowly across the substrate; second, they can change location by modifying their body shape, as an amoeba does. These movements are not centrally coordinated, since no muscle or nerve tissues exist. It can happen that an individual moves simultaneously in two different directions and consequently divides into two parts. It has been possible to demonstrate a close connection between body shape and the speed of locomotion, which is also a function of available food: * At low nutrient density, the spread-out area fluctuates slightly but irregularly; speed remains relatively constant at about 15 micrometres per second. * If nutrient density is high, however, the area covered oscillates with a stable period of about 8 minutes, in which the greatest extent reached by the organism can be as much as twice the smallest. Its speed, which remains consistently below 5 micrometres per second, varies with the same period. In this case, a high speed always corresponds to a reduced area, and vice versa. Since the transition is not smooth but happens abruptly, the two modes of extension can be very clearly separated from one another. The following is a qualitative explanation of the animal's behavior: * At low nutrient density, Trichoplax maintains a constant speed in order to uncover food sources without wasting time. * Once such a source is identified by high nutrient density, the organism increases its area in regular increments and thereby enlarges the surface in contact with substrate. This enlarges the surface through which nutrients can be ingested. The animal reduces its speed at the same time in order to actually consume all of the available food. * Once this is nearly completed, Trichoplax reduces its area again to move on. Because food sources such as algal mats are often relatively extensive, it is reasonable for such an animal to stop moving after a brief period in order to flatten out again and absorb nutrients. Thus Trichoplax progresses relatively slowly in this phase. The actual direction in which Trichoplax moves each time is random: if we measure how fast an individual animal moves away from an arbitrary starting point, we find a linear relationship between elapsed time and mean square distance between starting point and present location. Such a relationship is also characteristic of random Brownian motion of molecules, which thus can serve as a model for locomotion in the Placozoa. Small animals are also capable of swimming actively with the aid of their cilia. As soon as they come into contact with a possible substrate, a dorsoventral response occurs: the dorsal cilia continue to beat, whereas the cilia of ventral cells stop their rhythmic beating. At the same time, the ventral surface tries to make contact with the substrate; small protrusions and invaginations, the microvilli found on the surface of the columnar cells, help in attaching to the substrate via their adhesive action. Regeneration A notable characteristic of the Placozoa is that they can regenerate themselves from extremely small groups of cells. Even when large portions of the organism are removed in the laboratory, a complete animal develops again from the remainder. It is also possible to rub Trichoplax adhaerens through a strainer in such a manner that individual cells are not destroyed but are separated from one another to a large extent. In the test tube they then find their way back together again to form complete organisms. If this procedure is performed on several previously strained individuals simultaneously, the same thing occurs. In this case, however, cells that previously belonged to a particular individual can suddenly show up as part of another. Reproduction The Placozoa normally propagate asexually, dividing in the middle to produce two (or sometimes, three) roughly equal-sized daughters. These remain loosely connected for a while after fission. More rarely, budding processes are observed: spherules of cells separate from the dorsal surface; each of these combines all known cell types and subsequently grows into an individual of its own. Sexual reproduction is thought to be triggered by excessive population density. As a result, the animals absorb liquid, begin to swell, and separate from the substrate so that they float freely in the water. In the protected interior space, the ventral cells form an ovum surrounded by a special envelope, the fertilisation membrane; the ovum is supplied with nutrients by the surrounding syncytium, allowing energy-rich yolk to accumulate in its interior. Once maturation of the ovum is complete, the rest of the animal degenerates, liberating the ovum itself. Small unciliated cells that form at the same time are interpreted to be spermatozoa. It has not yet been possible to observe fertilisation itself; the existence of the fertilisation membrane is currently taken to be evidence, however, that it has taken place. Putative eggs have been observed, but they degrade typically at the 32‚Äì64 cell stage. Neither embryonic development nor sperm have been observed. Despite lack of observation of sexual reproduction in lab, the genetic structure of the populations in wild is compatible with the sexual reproduction mode, at least for species of the analysed genotype H5. Usually even before its liberation, the ovum initiates cleavage processes in which it becomes completely pinched through at the middle. A ball of cells characteristic of animals, the blastula, is ultimately produced in this manner, with a maximum of 256 cells. Development beyond this 256-cell stage has not yet been observed. Trichoplax lack a homologue of the Boule protein that appears to be ubiquitous and conserved in males of all species of other animals tested. If its absence implies the species has no males, then perhaps its \\"sexual\\" reproduction may be a case of the above-described process of regeneration combining cells separated from two separate organisms into one. Due to the possibility of its cloning itself by asexual propagation without limit, the life span of Placozoa is infinite; in the laboratory, several lines descended from a single organism have been maintained in culture for an average of 20 years without the occurrence of sexual processes. Role as a model organism Long ignored as an exotic, marginal phenomenon, Trichoplax adhaerens is today viewed as a potential biological model organism. In particular, research is needed to determine how a group of cells that cannot be considered full-fledged epithelial tissue organizes itself, how locomotion and coordination occur in the absence of true muscle and nerve tissue, and how the absence of a concrete body axis affects the animal's biology. At the genetic level, the way in which Trichoplax adhaerens protects against damage to its genome needs to be studied, particularly with regard to the existence of special DNA-repair processes. Complete decoding of the genome should also clarify the placozoans' place in evolution, which continues to be controversial. In addition to basic research, this animal could also be suitable for studying wound-healing and regeneration processes; as yet unidentified metabolic products should be researched. Finally, Trichoplax adhaerens is also being considered as an animal model for testing compounds and antibacterial drugs. Systematics Currently, only one species, Trichoplax adhaerens, is acknowledged to belong to the Placozoa. The Italian Francesco Saverio Monticelli described another species in 1893, which he found in the waters around Naples, naming it Treptoplax reptans. However, this has not been observed since 1896, and most zoologists today doubt its existence. Significant genetic differences have been observed between collected specimens matching the morphological description of T. adhaerens, suggesting that it may be a cryptic species complex. At least 8 distinct genotypes (marked from H1 to H8) were observed. Because great genetic differences often occur between representatives of Trichoplax adhaerens, differences that in other taxa would result in their being spread among different genera, it is currently unclear whether the single species based on morphological criteria does not actually correspond to a group of cryptospecies, i.e. species that are not outwardly distinguishable from one another. Distribution of the genetic variants is not a function of geography: some variants are found in multiple regions (e.g. Pacific, Caribbean and Red Sea). At the same time, very different genetic variants can be isolated from the same habitat. References Further reading * Edward E. Ruppert, R. S. Fox, R. D.

The paper is printed at The Harvard Crimson press. As of September, 2017, it also publishes content online. Early history The Register Forum was created by a merger of Cambridge's two high schools in 1977, though its lineage traces back to 1891, when the C.M.T.S. Register was founded. That newspaper was renamed the Rindge Register when the Cambridge Manual Training School became the Rindge School. It was a bi-monthly journal in tabloid format of happenings at that school. Before Cambridge High & Latin (CHLS) merged with Rindge Technical, CHLS also published a student-staffed, well-illustrated, regularly-issued, bound, periodic journal containing essays, relevant news, interviews, coverage of theatrical events, a gossip column, CHLS sports activity results, and other news of interest to the student body. Organization The Register Forum consists of an editorial board as well as contributing writers, photographers, illustrators, copyeditors, and layout designers. Masthead The Register Forum editorial board includes managing editors and the editor-in-chief.

Both he and his wife Lillian Moller Gilbreth were industrial engineers and efficiency experts who contributed to the study of industrial engineering in fields such as motion study and human factors.  Biography   Early life and education  Gilbreth was born in Fairfield, Maine, on July 7, 1868. He was the third child and only son of John Hiram Gilbreth and Martha Bunker Gilbreth. His mother had been a schoolteacher. His father owned a hardware store and was a stockbreeder. When Gilbreth was three and a half years old his father died suddenly from pneumonia. After his father's death his mother moved the family to Andover, Massachusetts, to find better schools for her children. The substantial estate left by her husband was managed by her husband's family. By the fall of 1878 the money had been lost or stolen and Martha Gilbreth had to find a way to make a living. She moved the family to Boston where there were good public schools. She opened a boarding house since the salary of a schoolteacher would not support the family. Gilbreth was not a good student. He attended Rice Grammar School, but his mother was concerned enough to teach him at home for a year. He attended Boston's English High School, and his grades improved when he became interested in his science and math classes. He took the entrance examinations for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but wanted his mother to be able to give up the boarding house. He decided to go to work rather than to college. Whidden Construction Company Renton Whidden, Gilbreth's old Sunday School teacher, hired him for his building company. He was to start as a laborer, learn the various building trades, and work his way up in the firm. In July 1885 at age 17 he started as a bricklayer's helper. As he learned bricklaying he noticed the many variations in the bricklayers' methods and efficiency. This began his interest in finding \\"the one best way\\" of executing any task. He quickly learned every part of building work and contracting, and advanced rapidly. He took night school classes to learn mechanical drawing. After five years he was a superintendent, which allowed his mother to give up her boarding house. Using his observations of workmen laying brick, Gilbreth developed a multilevel scaffold that kept the bricks within easy reach of the bricklayer. He began patenting his innovations with this \\"Vertical Scaffold\\", then developed and patented the \\"Gilbreth Waterproof Cellar\\". He made innovations in concrete construction, and joined the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) as well. After ten years, at age 27, he was the chief superintendent. When Widden was unwilling to make him a partner, he resigned to start his own company. Further career Gilbreth then became a building contractor, then an inventor with several patents, and finally a management engineer. He eventually became an occasional lecturer at Purdue University, which houses his papers. Gilbreth discovered his vocation as a young building contractor when he sought ways to make bricklaying faster and easier. This grew into a collaboration with his wife, Lillian Moller Gilbreth, who studied the work habits of manufacturing and clerical employees in all sorts of industries to find ways to increase output and make their jobs easier. He and Lillian founded a management consulting firm, Gilbreth, Inc., focusing on such endeavors. They were involved in the development of the design for the Simmons Hardware Company's Sioux City Warehouse. The architects had specified that hundreds of hardened concrete piles were to be driven in to allow the soft ground to take the weight of two million bricks required to construct the building. The \\"Time and Motion\\" approach could be applied to the bricklaying and the transportation. The building was also required to support efficient input and output of deliveries via its own railroad switching facilities. Gilbreth, one of the founders of industrial engineering, used \\"cost-plus-a- fixed sum\\" contracts in his building contracting business. He described this method in an article in Industrial Magazine in 1907, comparing it to fixed price and guaranteed maximum price methods.  Family  Gilbreth married Lillian Evelyn Moller on October 19, 1904, in Oakland, California; they had 12 children. Their names were Anne Moller Gilbreth Barney (1905-1987), Mary Elizabeth Gilbreth (1906‚Äì1912), Ernestine Moller Gilbreth Carey (1908-2006), Martha Bunker Gilbreth Tallman (1909-1968), Frank Bunker Gilbreth Jr. (1911-2001), William Moller Gilbreth (1912-1990), Lillian Gilbreth Johnson (1914-2001), Frederick Moller Gilbreth (1916-2015), Daniel Bunker Gilbreth (1917-2006), John Moller Gilbreth (1919-2002), Robert Moller Gilbreth (1920-2007), and Jane Moller Gilbreth Heppes (1922-2006); there was also a stillborn daughter (1915) who was not named.  Death  Gilbreth died of a heart attack on June 14, 1924, at age 55. He was at the Lackawanna Terminal in Montclair, New Jersey, talking with his wife by telephone. Lillian outlived him by 48 years.  Work   Motion studies  Gilbreth in about 1916 Original Films Of Frank B. Gilbreth (Part I) Gilbreth served in the U.S. Army during World War I. His assignment was to find quicker and more efficient means of assembling and disassembling small arms. According to Claude George (1968), Gilbreth reduced all motions of the hand into some combination of 17 basic motions. These included grasp, transport loaded, and hold. Gilbreth named the motions therbligs ‚Äî \\"Gilbreth\\" spelled backwards with letters th transposed to their original order. He used a motion picture camera that was calibrated in fractions of minutes to time the smallest of motions in workers. Their emphasis on the \\"one best way\\" and therbligs predates the development of continuous quality improvement (CQI), and the late 20th century understanding that repeated motions can lead to workers experiencing repetitive motion injuries. Gilbreth was the first to propose the position of \\"caddy\\" (Gilbreth's term) to a surgeon, who handed surgical instruments to the surgeon as needed. Gilbreth also devised the standard techniques used by armies around the world to teach recruits how to rapidly disassemble and reassemble their weapons even when blindfolded or in total darkness.  Scientific management  The work of the Gilbreths is often associated with that of Frederick Winslow Taylor, yet there was a substantial philosophical difference between the Gilbreths and Taylor. The symbol of Taylorism was the stopwatch; Taylor was concerned primarily with reducing process times. The Gilbreths, in contrast, sought to make processes more efficient by reducing the motions involved. They saw their approach as more concerned with workers' welfare than Taylorism, which workers themselves often perceived as concerned mainly with profit. This difference led to a personal rift between Taylor and the Gilbreths which, after Taylor's death, turned into a feud between the Gilbreths and Taylor's followers. After Frank's death, Lillian Gilbreth took steps to heal the rift; however, some friction remains over questions of history and intellectual property.The Gilbreth Network at gilbrethnetwork.tripod.com  Fatigue study  In conducting their Motion Study method to work, they found that the key to improving work efficiency was in reducing unnecessary motions. Not only were some motions unnecessary, but they caused employee fatigue. Their efforts to reduce fatigue included reduced motions, tool redesign, parts placement, and bench and seating height, for which they began to develop workplace standards. The Gilbreths' work broke ground for contemporary understanding of ergonomics.The Gilbreth Network at gilbrethnetwork.tripod.com  Legacy  Frank and Lillian Gilbreth often used their large family (and Frank himself) as guinea pigs in experiments. Their family exploits are lovingly detailed in the 1948 book Cheaper by the Dozen, written by son Frank Jr. and daughter Ernestine (Ernestine Gilbreth Carey). The book inspired two films of the same name. The first, in 1950, starred Clifton Webb and Myrna Loy. The second, in 2003, starred comedians Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt, and bears no resemblance to the book, except that it features a family with twelve children, and the wife's maiden name is Gilbreth. A 1952 sequel titled Belles on Their Toes chronicled the adventures of the Gilbreth family after Frank's 1924 death. A later biography of his parents, Time Out For Happiness, was written by Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Jr. alone in 1962. The award for lifetime achievement by the Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers (IISE) is named in Frank and Lillian Gilbreth's honor.  Selected publications  Frank and Lillian Gilbreth wrote in collaboration, but Lillian's name was not included on the title page until after she earned her PhD.  *  References  Further reading  *  External links  , comprehensive family and professional history. , books by and about the Gilbreths and Scientific Management * \\"The Gilbreth 'Bug-lights', by Frank B.

This was eventually collected as a Trade Paper Back (TPB), titled Squee's Wonderful Big Giant Book of Unspeakable Horrors. Squee Todd Casil, better known as Squee after the noise he makes when frightened, is a young boy who first appeared in issue #1, living next door to the title character, Johnny C. His parents neglect him (especially his father, who works long hours) and his only shown friend other than Johnny is a small teddy bear that he carries around named Shmee. Shmee tells Squee in a dream that all his fears and nightmares are inside him. Squee is also friends with Satan's son, with whom he attends school. He later had his own series called Squee!, which was collected in Squee's Wonderful Big Giant Book Of Unspeakable Horrors. He also had another friend named Andy, but he was attacked and killed by a dog. A quiet, introverted child who is frequently targeted by bullies, Squee has been forced to mature a bit more quickly than his peers. He is fond of writing, but only receives criticism from his teacher and taunting from his classmates. Any attempts he makes to deflect these hostilities only results in being shoved into the dirt or otherwise humiliated. Squee's mother is addicted to some form of pill and spends a lot of time lying around in a nearly incoherent state. She often forgets who Squee is, or that she even has a child. Squee's father loathes him and never misses a chance to blame Squee for 'ruining' his life, claiming that he \\"hasn't smiled once since [Squee] was born.\\" Having little patience for anything Squee says or does, he eventually becomes convinced that Squee is mentally unstable, and by the end of the series, has him committed to the \\"Defective Head Meat Institute.\\" Squee's grandfather claims to keep healthy and young by consuming his children's first-borns, and subsequently attempts to devour Squee, only to reveal in horrifying fashion that he is in fact a cyborg and quite possibly insane. Squee's next door neighbor is Johnny C, aka \\"Nny\\" (pronounced knee), the main character of the series. \\"Nny\\" regularly visits Squee late at night by breaking into his room. The series focused more on the 'mentoring' or 'big brother' aspect of \\"Nny\\" and Squee's relationship, but little interaction occurs in Squee!, aside from the occasional drawing or note left in Squee's room, or short references to 'the crazy neighbor man' (he does appear as an out-patient of \\"Defective Head Meat Institute\\", who Squee is oddly pleased to see). Squee has only one friend, albeit a possibly imaginary one, the dilapidated teddy bear affectionately referred to as Shmee. Only one real person makes any attempt to befriend Squee, a boy named Pepito who happens to be the Antichrist. During the course of the series, Squee encounters a killer chihuahua (that fatally mauls the only classmate who was friendly to him), zombified classmates, sporting mishaps, alien abductions, near recruitment into Satan's army, an encounter with his future self, a ghostly visitor, a giant murderous dust mite, and eventual committal to a mental institution despite being one of the most sane characters in the comic. These experiences lead him to remark to a 'lamb-baby-dog-thing' in one strip that some bitter cartoonist must be drawing his life and therefore he doesn't want to get too attached to anyone or anything in it. Shmee Squee carries around with him a dilapidated teddy bear he has named Shmee. Often, Squee talks to Shmee like a real person, confiding in the stuffed toy, who apparently responds though non-readable dialogue is ever exchanged between the two, save one strip in which Squee has a conversation with Shmee in his dreams. Shmee claims to be a 'trauma sponge,' soaking up all the negative feelings and experiences and storing them inside himself for Squee. He says this will prevent Squee from becoming like Johnny C. During the silent exchanges they share on various occasions, Shmee often suggests that Squee do something violent, such as arson, in retaliation for some wrong committed against him. Squee laughs these suggestions off, assuming that Shmee is joking, though to the reader it is fairly obvious that he is not.

It was established in 1962 and is registered as an educational charity which hosts plays, concerts and films shows, and holds art exhibitions, music classes, and workshops for all ages. The centre re-opened in May 2010 after a ¬£15m facelift. It has four performance auditoria, rehearsal and media studios, a cinema and art gallery. With 1,028,371 visits in 2015, mac is the 14th most- visited free attractions in England. History Signage from the defunct HP Sauce factory in Aston, exhibited at the new mac in June 2010. The idea for an arts centre in Cannon Hill Park was the result of a meeting between local residents: theatre writer and director John English, his wife, Mollie Randle, and local politician Frank Price in the late 1950s. Eventually of land in Cannon Hill Park was made available by Birmingham City Council in 1962 for this purpose. It also housed the Cannon Hill Puppet Theatre under John M. Blundall. In 1965 director Mike Leigh went to work at the theatre and started experimenting with the idea that writing and rehearsing could potentially be part of the same process. Between 1972 and 1987 it was the home of the former Birmingham Youth Theatre, a company aimed at encouraging and nurturing talent amongst people aged 15 to 23 who were not involved with drama or theatre. This company was founded by local teacher Derek Nicholls, who later became Director of the mac. Adrian Lester and Andrew Tiernan began their careers there. Other artists who performed here include Yoko Ono, Kate Malone, and Ewen Henderson; and renowned musicians and bands such as Ruby Turner, Ocean Colour Scene, UB40, and ELO played at MAC in the early stages of their career. Indian classical dancer Nahid Siddiqui taught Kathak classes here, and famous Bharatanatyam exponent Chitra Bolar started teaching at MAC in 1978. Their contributions established MAC as a centre for South Asian dance and performing arts. The centre closed from April 2008 to 1 May 2010 for a ¬£14.8 million refurbishment.

Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Bob McLeod, Cannonball first appeared in The New Mutants (September 1982). Cannonball is a mutant who uses the ability to fly at jet speeds while encased in an impenetrable force field. Cannonball was a founding member of the X-Men's junior team, the New Mutants, and served as X-Force's second-in-command and field leader. He eventually joined the X-Men, becoming the first member of a secondary team to \\"graduate\\". The eldest of a large Kentucky coal mining family, several of his siblings, such as Husk, Aero, Icarus and Jeb, are also mutants and have joined X-Men-related teams. Charlie Heaton portrayed Sam Guthrie in the 2020 film The New Mutants (2020). Publication history Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Bob McLeod, Cannonball first appeared in The New Mutants graphic novel (September 1982) as a member of the titular super-group. McLeod later commented, \\"I always liked Cannonball the best [of the New Mutants]. I tried to give all the mutants distinct body types and characteristics, and with his big ears and lanky frame, he was just the most fun to draw.\\" After a guest appearance in Uncanny X-Men # 167, the character appeared regularly in the title The New Mutants (vol. 1) from its first issue to its hundredth issue (1983-1991), and continued to appear in its replacement title X-Force (volume 1) (1991). In X-Force # 44 (1995), Cannonball leaves X-Force to join the X-Men, appearing regularly in X-Men (vol. 2) # 48-89 and Uncanny X-Men (volume 1) # 323-355 (1995-1998). He rejoins his friends in X-Force while on an extended road trip in X-Force # 86 (1998), and stays with the team through issue # 117 (2001), after which the title changes drastically, taken over by the team later to be known as X-Statix. Cannonball next appears as a member of the X-Corporation in New X-Men # 128, 130, 131 and 140 (2002-2003), and then rejoins the X-Men in a splinter team led by Storm in X-Treme X-Men (vol. 1) # 24-46 (2003-2004). After the cancellation of X-Treme X-Men, Cannonball appears regularly with the X-Men in the mid to late 2000s, including Uncanny X-Men (vol. 1) # 444-447 (2004) and # 466-474 (2006), X-Men (vol. 2) # 188-204 (2006-2007), Young X-Men # 1-6 (2008) and Secret Invasion: X-Men # 1-4 (2009).

During his time with the X-Men, he also infiltrates the presidential campaign of anti-mutant candidate Graydon Creed, using the alias \\"Samson Guthry\\". Despite the rather transparent alias, Sam is able to remain undetected until Creed is assassinated on the eve of the election. Cannonball rejoins X-Force, now operating in San Francisco, and becomes team leader after Siryn is injured. Cable has left, but the team find a new mentor in Pete Wisdom, who introduces the team to the world of espionage. Sam and Tabitha get back together. After Wisdom's alleged death, Sam leads the team again and attempts to continue Wisdom's crusade. Eventually, Sam and the other members of X-Force have to fake their deaths. Back to basics Storm asks Cannonball to join her X-Treme X-Men, a group of X-Men operating outside of Professor X's leadership. The team later rejoins the central X-Men. Sam is injured on a mission and once again decided to break for some peace. He uses the time to work on his own farm, which he had bought with his X-Corporation paychecks. While on the farm, Sam found himself teaming up again with Cable and reformed X-Force against the threat of the Skornn. Sam has once more joined the active roster of the X-Men, whose team is co-led by Nightcrawler and Bishop. For a while, he watches over the younger, more carefree students at the X-Mansion. He also functions as a member of the X-Treme Sanctions Executive (XSE). He has already participated in helping the 198 and fighting the Shi'ar Death Commandos. He soon suffers the death of his brother Jay, who is killed by William Stryker. In the first part of The First Foursaken story arc, Cannonball went with the X-Men to Central Park, where they fight the Foursaken, who then capture the X-Men and sent them elsewhere.

Aboard the Blackbird, the two are engaged in midair by Sunfire, who cripples the jet. Cannonball manages to escape and battle Shiro, who reveals that he killed Cable. Cannonball shakes it off, explaining that it \\"wouldn't matter who told me that, ah'd still be sayin' 'show me the body.'\\" Cannonball and Iceman attempt to recover the Destiny Diaries, which are hidden in a dilapidated brewery.X-Men vol. 2 #203 The Marauders attack them, and Sam is seriously injured. Dr. Henry McCoy attends to his injuries and evaluates his condition. He notes that Sam's brain scan indicates sluggish and non-continuous activity, but the young mutant quickly recovers and is capable of taking part in the final fight against the Marauders.X-Men vol. 2 #207 Divided We Stand After Cyclops disbands the X-Men, Cannonball goes home. His sister Paige picks him up at the airport, extremely happy to have him back, but Sam is moody and withdrawn, and after she confronts him about his mood he angrily blasts off into the sky saying he should have never come home.X-Men: Divided We Stand #1 (2008) Manifest Destiny Sam is soon called by Cyclops, informing him that the X-Men are reforming in San Francisco, and he agrees to join the new team. He arrives in San Francisco as Magneto is attacking the city with a group of antique Sentinels. Sam manages to plow into Magneto, disarming his artificial magnetism suit, and giving the X-Men the upper hand in the battle. However, Magneto still manages to escape.Uncanny X-Men #500 He is later seen at a bar with Karma and Dani Moonstar, where he reveals himself to be disillusioned by the idea of changing the world and instead is content with making sure no one else dies the way his brother Jay did. He is called upon to help deal with Empath.Uncanny X-Men #503 Reforming the New Mutants After receiving an anonymous tip in Colorado about a young mutant endangering a small town, Dani and Shan are sent to investigate and calm the locals. During their mission, Magik reappears back at the X-Men's base in San Francisco after teleporting off into the future after the events of \\"X-Infernus\\".

They eventually find an unconscious Shan and are tricked into freeing Legion.New Mutants vol. 3 #1 The personalities in Legion's mind want to kill Dani because she can help Legion get them under control. Legion locates Dani in a jail cell and is about to kill her when Sam stops him. Dani tells Sam to let her out but Sam refuses, saying she'll be safer in the cell since she doesn't have her powers anymore. Sam and Roberto go off to fight Legion leaving Dani behind. Unbeknownst to them, one of Legion's personalities has the ability to project himself and is stalling them while he prepares to kill Dani only to be stopped by Magik and Magma. They free Dani as Legion retreats, Sam apologizes but gets punched in the face by an angry Dani. When asked where she's going Dani replies \\"to make myself useful\\"; she returns brandishing numerous firearms and tells the others that they're going after Legion.New Mutants vol. 3 #3 However Sam tells Dani to go, she isn't a mutant anymore and to stop pretending she is because one of the most powerful mutants on earth wants her dead. Dani, upset gets into a van and drives away only to turn back minutes later after Sam and the rest of the New Mutants are badly beaten. After Legion is caught, Sam tries to apologize but Dani limps away, ignoring him. Sam confesses to Cyclops he feels as if he has messed up but Cyclops congratulates him on keeping everyone alive and that's all that matters.New Mutants vol. 3 #4 In the aftermath of Utopia, Scott reveals to Dani that Sam didn't pick her for his team, making her very upset and angry. The two fight and come to an understanding and Sam allows Dani on the team.New Mutants vol. 3 #5 Later, over a conversation about Sam's past romantic affiliations (particularly Lila Cheney) Sam and Danielle share a kiss (for comparative purposes) that is interrupted by the team.

During the fight, Smasher and the U.S.Avengers arrive to help. After Ritchie and his army are sent to prison, the heroes head back home.U.S.Avengers #12 Powers and abilities Cannonball is a mutant who possesses the ability to bodily generate thermo- chemical energy and release it from his skin. This energy is used as thrust to cause his body to be propelled through the air like a rocket, at great heights and speeds with considerable maneuverability. He can control his speed and direction through sheer act of will. At first, he could only release this energy from his feet and legs, but now he can fire it from almost any part of his body, to a wide variety of effects. This energy also manifests itself as an impenetrable and virtually indestructible \\"blast field\\" that protects him from bodily harm. He can use this blast-field for the following effects: to function as a personal shield or extending it to encompass others, to shape the field around another person to imprison them, or to absorb outside kinetic impact into his own energy supply, enabling him to increase the bludgeoning power of his blows or to create explosive shock waves upon impact.

Born at Denmark in Ashtabula County, Ohio, he dropped out of Miami University in 1861 to join the Union Army. After a short stint in the Army, he returned to Miami University and earned his undergraduate degree from there in 1863. After the Civil War, Brice studied law at the University of Michigan and then started a business career where he amassed a fortune, largely in railroads. In 1879, he became president of the Lake Erie and Western Railroad and built the Nickel Plate Road in 1882. A Democrat, Brice was the chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 1889 until 1892 and won election to the Senate in 1890, serving a single term in office. Early life Senator Calvin Brice, John Singer Sargent, 1898 Calvin Brice was born on September 17, 1845, in Denmark Township, Ashtabula County, Ohio, to Elizabeth Stewart and William Kirkpatrick Brice, a Presbyterian minister of no great wealth. Originally home-schooled, he later entered the Columbus Grove public school system in Putnam County. Showing some promise as a student, Brice began preparations for higher education and in 1859 gained admission to Miami University. After graduating in 1863 with high honors,Mach, American National Biography Online he would become a devoted alumnus later in life. His efforts in 1885 and 1888 to provide funding for the University were largely responsible for its survival, and a science building, Brice Hall (now demolished) was named in his honor. Military and early legal career Brice's first attempt to join the army in 1861 met with little success, after being turned down because of his young age. In the summer of 1862, however, Brice enlisted and served three months in the 86th Regiment of the Ohio Volunteer Infantry, seeing action in West Virginia. In 1863 he returned to and graduated from Miami University and worked as a schoolmaster, before he joined the army again in 1864, this time serving as captain to a company of volunteers he recruited for the 180th Ohio Infantry. Brice rose rapidly through the ranks of the Union Army and, by the end of the war, attained the position of Lieutenant-Colonel. With \\"no desire for an army career,\\" according to historian Thomas Mach, Brice ended his military career soon after to pursue a career in law. He earned his law degree from the University of Michigan Law School in 1865 and passed the Ohio bar in 1866. Business career Brice found his break into both the business and political worlds under unusual circumstances. Around 1880, when his law practice was proving unsuccessful and his mother's home was at risk of foreclosure, Brice wrote to the holder of the mortgage, the then-Governor Charles Foster, and offered to attend to any legal interests he needed help with. Foster declined the legal help, but offered instead to pay Brice five hundred dollars to negotiate a business deal with Wall Street on his behalf. Brice accepted, and proved a shrewd businessman; Foster would later name Brice \\"the most remarkable man [he] ever met [‚Ä¶] the most successful borrower [he] ever saw.\\" Ignoring Foster's explicit instructions for his work on the business proceedings in New York and instead following his instincts, Brice returned with a shocking profit of $40,000 and earned the trust and friendship of the Governor. After working as a private lawyer, Brice joined the Lake Erie and Louisville Railroad law department, where he gained his initial experience with the railroad industry, learning how to operate, fund, and expand its lines. Foster became impressed with Brice's plan to save a foundering rail project running from Toledo to Ohio's coal fields after traveling to Europe to secure funding in 1871.\\"A Biographical History of Darke County, Ohio: Compendium of National Biography\\", Lewis Publishing Company, 1900. p. 181. Retrieved 4 Mar 2017 With Foster's support, Brice managed to guide the railroad through the Panic of 1873 and expand it into Lima and other areas. Brice eventually rose to President of the company in 1887, which by then had become known as the Lake Erie and Western Railroad. Over time, Brice netted a great fortune, laying claim to ten different railroads while spreading into numerous other businesses, including the National Telegraph Company and the Chase National Bank of New York. Perhaps his most marked achievement came with his role in the construction of the Nickel Plate Road in 1882, which ran from New York to St. Louis. He later sold this road for a generous profit to William Henry Vanderbilt, who recognized it as a dangerous competitor. Later in life, Brice became involved with railroad projects in China. He was a founding member of the American Asiatic Association, an organization responsible for pursuing American trade interests in China under the Open Door Policy. In the late 1890s, he began an attempt to build a railroad between Canton and Hankou on Mainland China. However, he died before the project was completed. Throughout his business career, two overlying themes appeared dominant - Brice's ability to take a failing or fledgling business and restructure it to make profit, and his involvement with Charles Foster, whose support was crucial to Brice's success. The mining town of Briceville, Tennessee, which he proved instrumental in helping to connect to railroad service, is named for him. At the same time, however, Brice remained selfless in his aims and frugal in his desires, unlike most of the so-called robber barons of his day. According to historian James White, Brice did not accept much compensation for his services during a business transaction and often held himself accountable to the public by \\"stripping a proposition of every incumbrance and laying it bare for inspection.\\" Political career In addition to his business career, Brice played an ongoing role in state and national politics. A Bourbon Democrat, he was an electoral candidate for Samuel J. Tilden in 1876 and later worked for the 1884 presidential campaign of Grover Cleveland. As time passed, Brice became more active in the Democratic Party and was elected as a delegate-at- large to the 1888 Democratic National Convention in St. Louis. In 1889, Brice was chosen to replace the late William H. Barnum as Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, until he was replaced in that position by William Harrity of Pennsylvania in 1892, after expressing doubts about renominating Grover Cleveland at that year's convention. Yet, his wealth and connections made him an influential party chairman, earning him the nickname \\"Calvin $ellars Brice\\". In 1890 Brice won the nomination over John A. McMahon as his party's candidate to succeed George H. Payne, the outgoing U.S. Senator from Ohio. It was a notable campaign in which media critics commenced a war with him, including over residency issues whereas he had been a citizen of New York in the previous years.\\"The Democratic party of the state of Ohio\\", Thomas Edward Powell. Ohio publishing company, 1913. p. 375-377. Retrieved 4 mar 2017 Heavy campaign spending secured the election of a Democratic majority to the Ohio General Assembly, enabling Brice's selection. Because of suspicious circumstances deriving from Payne's initial selection, though, Brice was scrutinized by the Senate before assuming office. Although Brice enacted few memorable measures as Senator, he gained a reputation as one of the most hard- working and intelligent members of Congress, serving on the Democratic Steering Committee, Committee on Appropriations, and as Chairman of the Committee on Pacific Railroads. Brice's reversal on the critical issue of tariff reform, however, cost him the support of many in his Democratic base. Also, Brice's strong ties to New York businesses led some in Ohio to call him \\"New York's Third Senator\\". p. 144 Though Brice fended off a censure motion at the 1894 Democratic party state convention, he lost his bid for reelection to Republican Joseph B. Foraker three years later. After his defeat, Brice dropped out of Ohio politics. He died suddenly and unexpectedly in New York City of an acute attack of pneumonia on December 15, 1898.

He is noted as the inventor of a number of classic illusions, including the Zig Zag Girl. He also became an authority on origami. Career The young Edward first got interested in magic after an unknown ex-serviceman appeared at his school with a magic show later described as \\"rather poor\\". Williams came to London at the age of 20 and began by working in the magic department of Gamages toy shop.The Times, \\"Obituaries\\", 13 January 1978, p.16, col.F He began performing in music halls under the title \\"Ned Williams, the Boy Magician from South Africa\\". By 1932 he was appearing in the Maskelyne's Mysteries magic show in various London theatres.The Times, \\"Varieties, &c.;\\", 9 March 1932, p.10, col. E He was the first British illusionist to move from stage performing to television, appearing in the BBC TV show Variety in 1937The Times, \\"Broadcasting\\", 9 February 1937, p.9, col. A and numerous times after the war when the BBC resumed broadcasting. He developed a number of new tricks, including the Neon Light and the now ubiquitous Zig Zag Girl. His lesser known inventions include the Aztec Lady, The Blades of Opah, and Aunt Matilda's Wardrobe. Much of his inventive genius was put into written form and he is known as one of the most prodigious authors on the subject of magical effects. However, although Harbin was brilliantly creative in the field of magic he was not a particularly good writer and his friend and associate Eric C Lewis has stated that many of Harbin's titles were ghost written for him. In about 1952 Harbin appeared in a minor part as a magician in the film The Limping Man, produced by Cy Endfield. In 1953, Harbin and a friend of Endfield, Gershon Legman (1917‚Äì1999), discovered a common interest in the Japanese art of paper-folding. Harbin wrote many books on the subject, beginning with Paper Magic (illustrated by the young art student, the Australian Rolf Harris who in the middle of the project, caught the origami idea and contributed several intricate models himself) in 1956, and was the first President of the British Origami Society. He was the first Westerner to use the word origami for this art-form. He also presented a series of origami programmes for ITV in its \\"Look-In\\" magazines for children in the 1970s. His grave is at Golders Green Crematorium in London.

The freeway runs to the south and west of Elkhart and South Bend and Niles and consists of segments of U.S. Route 31 (US 31) and US 20; those two highway designations run concurrently at the southwestern rim of the South Bend metropolitan area. It continues north to run along the St. Joseph River valley. The freeway was first built in Indiana in the 1960s, although plans in Michigan date back to the 1950s. Indiana completed its portion of the freeway in 1998, while Michigan has opened its last segment in early 2003. Further plans, if completed, would extend the freeway from the current end to the north. The ultimate end will either be at the interchange between Interstate 196 (I-196) and I-94 as originally planned, or another interchange immediately to the southwest. Environmental concerns and other issues have forced a re-evaluation of the original 1981 plans for the northern end of the freeway. Route description The Parkway begins where US 20 expands to a divided highway southeast of Elkhart. To the east in Indiana the freeway feeds into an undivided segment of US 20 at County Road 17 (CR 17). From there it runs westward along the south sides of Elkhart and Mishawaka. South of South Bend, US 31 joins the Parkway, and then the Parkway turns northward along the west side of South Bend. Along this segment, US 20 turns back west and leaves the Parkway. The Parkway meets the Indiana Toll Road which carries I-80/I-90 before crossing the state line into Michigan. West of Niles, the Parkway meets US 12 and continues northwesterly running west of Berrien Springs. From there it runs northward to end at Napier Avenue east of St. Joseph. The St. Joseph Valley Parkway ends at Napier Avenue, but US 31 continues as a five-lane highway west along Napier to connect with I-94 and the rest of the US 31 routing north of there on I-196. The Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) and the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) both maintain the sections of the St. Joseph Valley Parkway in their respective states. Additionally, both departments have listed their freeway segments as part of the National Highway System, a system of roads important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. The two departments conduct surveys to measure the traffic levels along their roadways. This measurement is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT) which is a calculation of the traffic volume on a stretch of roadway for any average day of the year. INDOT's figures for 2007 showed that 30,753 vehicles used the freeway near its western end. The traffic volume drops to 19,914 vehicles near the Indiana Toll Road. In Michigan, the levels drop as low as 7,402 vehicles near the Napier Road interchange. History Name The \\"St. Joseph Valley Parkway\\" name was chosen by local chambers of commerce in the fall of 1992 as the result of a local contest held by a group of local businesses. The name was officially adopted by Michigan in 1993 (dedicated late 1995) and Indiana in 1995 (dedicated in mid-1995). Indiana section There had been a southern bypass of the South Bend and Elkhart areas planned since the 1930s. The first section of the highway, started in 1958 as Bypass US 20 (BYP US 20), was completed between US 20 and Mayflower Road (at the time State Road 123) on September 19, 1963. The freeway was extended to just past the SR 23 interchange in late Summer 1965, then further east to US 31, that section opening on December 15, 1967. The BYP US 20 designation was replaced by the US 31 designation in 1978. The exit with the Indiana East‚ÄìWest Toll Road/I-80/I-90 was built beginning in 1979 in conjunction with the northern extension to Michigan. Construction in the early 1990s extended the freeway in sections from US 31/Business US 31 (Bus. US 31) to its current end with US 20 at CR 17, with the portion from US 31/Bus. US 31 to SR 19 opening on December 11, 1991, and the portion from there to CR 17 opening on October 9, 1992. Ramps from Nimtz Parkway were opened November 3, 1997, and the portion in Elkhart was also named the \\"Dean R. Mock Expressway\\" in March 2002. Michigan section A plan to relocate US 31 in Berrien County, Michigan, existed as early as 1952. Planning to extend the South Bend Bypass northward into Michigan to I-96 (later I-196) began in 1962. A report issued in 1970 detailed four routing corridors, spawning a lawsuit over how Berrien Springs would be bypassed. Construction was to begin in 1975, but the Michigan State Highways Department delayed construction plans in 1972, pushing the start to 1977. The first section, running from the state line north to US 12, was completed and dedicated August 10, 1979, and opened to traffic by September 6 of that year. From there, US 31 was routed east along US 12 to Bus. US 12 and north along Bus. US 12 to the former routing of US 31/US 33. Final plans for the routing north to I-94 were approved in 1981. The Niles bypass section was opened August 16, 1987, bringing the freeway north to Walton Road northwest of Niles. Bus. US 31 was created along the former routing in Niles and Walton Road was rebuilt as a state trunkline connection between the northern end of the freeway and the former two-lane routing of US 31. The Berrien Springs bypass section was opened in late 1992, the southbound lanes opening on October 23 and the northbound on November 20. As a cost- saving measure, this section was initially an expressway with crossroads, and was converted to a freeway in stages through 1999. Since then, MDOT built a freeway segment north to Napier Avenue that was opened on August 27, 2003 at a cost of $97 million (equivalent to $ in ). A proposed spur westward to I-94 in the Stevensville area was never built. Construction of the northernmost portion of the parkway, between Napier Avenue and BL I-94/I-94 interchange, began in August 2020. The project is tentatively scheduled to be finished in late 2022. Future Mitchell's satyr East of Benton Harbor, Michigan, the St. Joseph Valley Parkway extension was under study due to environmental, economical and historical site issues. One of the environmental concerns relates to the habitat of an endangered species, the Mitchell's satyr butterfly that has its habitat in the area of the freeway extension. The habitat is home to the second-largest population of the rare butterfly. This freeway connection was originally approved in 1981 as part of a final environmental impact study that included the freeway built from Niles northward to Napier Avenue. Since that approval, the butterfly was discovered in the Blue Creek Fen in the late 1980s, and it was listed an endangered species in 1992. The listing stalled construction of the freeway north of Berrien Springs. The US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) issued an opinion two years later that the freeway project would jeopardize the species. MDOT was given permission to modify the previously approved freeway to cross the Blue Creek on longer bridges; the USFWS also required that any construction be done from elevated platforms, among other restrictions. In the interim, MDOT proceeded with construction of the southern portion of the last freeway segment, completing the freeway northward from Berrien Springs to the Napier Avenue interchange in August 2003. A revised environmental impact study to account for the butterfly's habitat was approved in 2004. The study compared the original proposal for this extension that involved connecting directly to I-196 at I-94 with a pair of alternate routines that involved connecting US 31 directly to BL I-94 at I-94 near Benton Harbor with auxiliary lanes to I-196. The recommendation was to use the PA-2 version of the alternative connection to avoid the Blue Creek Fen. At the time the last freeway segment was opened in 2003, MDOT expected the remaining segment would not take much longer to complete, but funding was not available for many years. Construction of the extension was not included for this reason in subsequent MDOT five-year highway projects plans, although most of the design work and land acquisition was identified in 2013 as having been finished. Funding for the project was listed in the 2017‚Äì21 plan draft released in July 2016, which split the remaining work into three phases. MDOT received a federal grant for the project in December 2018, citing at that time a completion date of 2022 or 2023 for the project. Until the freeway is complete, US 31 follows a stretch of Napier Avenue, which was upgraded in conjunction with the St. Joseph Valley Parkway opening to that point, westward to I-94. The US 31/I-94/BL I-94 interchange will be converted to a cloverleaf interchange or partial cloverleaf interchange if a connection is completed in the future. The St. Joseph Valley Parkway name has already been applied to this unbuilt section.

Conceived by writer/illustrator Rob Liefeld, the team first appeared in New Mutants #100 (April 1991) and soon afterwards was featured in its own series called X-Force. The group was originally a revamped version of the 1980s team, the New Mutants. X-Force's first leader was the mutant Cable. An offshoot of the X-Men, X-Force takes a more militant and aggressive approach towards its enemies compared to the X-Men. An alternate incarnation of X-Force appears in the 2018 film Deadpool 2 as part of the X-Men film series. A planned X-Force film adaption by 20th Century Fox was in production, but it was stopped after Disney bought 20th Century Fox. Publication history Publication The X-Force series was successful in the early 1990s, but its popularity waned after Liefeld left, which caused Marvel to implement several reforms to the title from 1995 until 2001 with varying degrees of success. Low sales on the X-Force series eventually prompted Marvel to revamp the title in 2001 with a new cast in the form of a group of self-interested young mutants who were gathered together by a corporation to become media stars and used the name X-Force. X-Force was canceled with #129 and relaunched as X-Statix, which coincided with a similar rebranding of the team in the story. After X-Statix was canceled with #26, Marvel reunited the original X-Force team for a six- issue 2004 limited series plotted and drawn by Liefeld. In 2007‚Äì2008, during the Messiah Complex crossover, a new version of the X-Force team was formed with Wolverine leading a more militaristic black ops branch of the X-Men. This squad would form the basis for a new X-Force series starting February 2008 by writers Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost, plus Clayton Crain as the artist. The series came to a conclusion in September 2010 as part of the Second Coming storyline that ran through various X-titles. The title was then relaunched in October 2010 as Uncanny X-Force with Rick Remender and Jerome Ope√±a as the creative team and Wolverine, Psylocke, Deadpool, Archangel, Fantomex, and E.V.A. as the initial roster. The Uncanny X-Force series ended at issue #35 in 2012 and was once again relaunched as Uncanny X-Force vol. 2 as part of Marvel NOW!, with a new team led by Storm and Psylocke, written by Sam Humphries. A concurrent X-Force book written by Dennis Hopeless, Cable and X-Force, was released at the same time, bringing Cable back into the X-Force fold. The two series ended in 2014 after a crossover between the two titled \\"Vendetta\\". A new X-Force (vol. 4), was launched featuring a black ops squad composed of Cable, Psylocke, Fantomex and Marrow, written by X-Men: Legacy writer Simon Spurrier. Uncanny X-Force X-Force was replaced in October 2010 with Uncanny X-Force by Rick Remender and Jerome Ope√±a. This new series introduces team members Psylocke, Fantomex, and Deadpool. According to Remender, \\"This is a group of characters that have had their souls stained by evil forces in the past, a common thread connecting them. They've already made the hard compromises in the past; they've all taken life.\\" The title had a three-issue \\"Fear Itself\\" tie-in miniseries, written by Rob Williams, with art by Simone Bianchi. As of issue #34, thirty-one characters were killed and 14 of them were from the \\"Age of Apocalypse\\" timeline. Uncanny X-Force Volume 2: 2013‚Äì2014 As part of Marvel NOW!, two new X-Force series would replace Remender's Uncanny X-Force. Prior to their announcement, the two titles were teased by a single word and the book's creative team: \\"Wanted\\" with Dennis Hopeless and Salvador Larroca and \\"Killers\\" with Sam Humphries and Ron Garney. \\"Wanted\\" was first revealed to be the brand new \\"Cable and X-Force\\" with \\"Killers\\" later revealed to be a relaunched \\"Uncanny X-Force.\\" Cable and X-Force, written by Dennis Hopeless and penciled by Salvador Larroca, featured Cable on the run after awakening from a coma in the post-AvX world. Harkening back to the early days of the original X-Force, Cable would lead an outlaw X-Force team consisting of Domino, Colossus, Forge, Doctor Nemesis and Boom- Boom, whose missions of stopping huge tragedies before they happen puts them at odds with the newly formed Uncanny Avengers, led by Cable's uncle, Havok. The relaunched Uncanny X-Force was written by Sam Humphries and penciled by Ron Garney, and featured a Psylocke-led team with an initial roster of Storm, Puck, and Cluster. They would be joined by Spiral and Bishop as they sought to locate a psychic mutant girl who had been kidnapped. Plot summary Volume 3 =Angels and Demons= Artist Clayton Crain signing copies of the series' third volume during an appearance at Midtown Comics in Manhattan The team's first mission has them investigating the theft of Bastion's head from a S.H.I.E.L.D. base. The trail leads back to the Purifiers, led by Matthew Risman and the mysterious Eli Bard. They attach Bastion's head to the body of a Nimrod unit, to use the revived Bastion in their \\"holy war\\" against mutantkind. Bastion retrieves an offspring of the technarch Magus from the ocean floor and revives several deceased X-Men villains, including Cameron Hodge, Bolivar Trask and Graydon Creed, by infecting their corpses with the Technarch Transmode Virus. The virus allows Bastion a degree of mental control over the revived corpses. He also infects two living subjects with the virus: Donald Pierce and the Leper Queen. During X-Force's raid on a Purifer base, Risman holds Wolfsbane hostage. While Wolverine calls for the team to stand down, X-23 decides Risman is bluffing and activates a concealed detonator that sets off a series of powerful explosives. The explosion brings most of the base down around them, but Risman is able to escape with Wolfsbane during the chaos. Wolverine later admonishes Laura for being so reckless with the lives of her teammates and for allowing Rahne to be kidnapped. After interrogating and killing numerous Purifiers, X-Force finds Rahne held in a warehouse, barely alive. Angel retrieves Elixir to heal Rahne, who wakes up soon after. Laura then catches the scent of Elixir's and Angel's blood, and runs off to help them. She reaches the room just in time to see Wolfsbane standing above Angel with his severed wings in her jaws. While in the Purifiers' custody, Rahne had been brainwashed by her deranged father, Reverend Craig, causing her to go berserk at the sight of an angelic figure. Wolfsbane savagely attacks Laura before handing over Angel's wings to the Purifiers. Elixir heals both his and Angel's wounds, then discovers that Angel's wings aren't organic and can't be regrown. Angel transforms into Archangel, complete with metallic wings. Archangel wounds Wolverine and X-23 before taking off toward the Purifiers' base, sensing his old wings. Meanwhile, the Purifiers use samples of Angel's stolen wings to develop techno-organic wings for their soldiers, giving them similar abilities to Archangel. The group of Purifiers given wings is dubbed \\"The Choir\\". X-Force pursues Archangel to the Purifiers' base and slaughters most of The Choir, while Risman discovers Eli Bard absorbing the Technarch offspring into his hand. X-23 kills Risman with a headshot, and briefly fights Eli. Eli overpowers her, but is prevented from killing her when Warpath stabs him, causing him to flee. Wolverine takes on Bastion, who deems the threat posed by Wolverine \\"unacceptable\\" and retreats. Afterwards, X-Force finds Archangel unconscious and in human form, complete with feathered wings. Wolverine informs Cyclops of the turn of events, and Cyclops asks which of X-Force's targets should be next.X-Force #1‚Äì6 =Old Ghosts= Once X-Force regroups at Angel's Aerie, they test the reactions of Rahne and Angel to one another. Rahne reverts to full feral form upon seeing Angel, who responds by transforming into Archangel. Wolverine and Elixir restrain Wolfsbane while Cyclops talks down Archangel, who has trouble controlling his Apocalypse-like mentality while in his transformed state. Laura calls in the Stepford Cuckoos to erase Elixir's memories of X-Force, to help them remain covert. Before they do so, Angel informs them of a live telecast featuring Graydon Creed, who claims an L.M.D. was assassinated in his place and publicly denounces mutants once more. Cyclops assembles X-Force, including Elixir, and unexpectedly declares the Vanisher as their next target. It is revealed that Scalphunter, a former Marauder, contacted Cyclops about a break-in at an old lab of Mister Sinister's that held an altered version of the Legacy Virus. While in pursuit of the Vanisher, the team runs into Domino, who joins forces with them to recover the Legacy Virus. After cornering Vanisher and inducing an inoperable brain tumor (courtesy of Elixir) to ensure his cooperation, Vanisher reveals he lost the virus while escaping from a horde of Marauder clones that were awakened after the death of Sinister. X-Force returns to the lab and kill the cloned Marauders inside. Domino retrieves the virus, only to be confronted by The Right's shocktroopers, who have come to take the virus for themselves. X-23 is injected with the virus while doing battle, and runs toward a nearby molten vat to destroy herself (thus destroying the virus). Elixir catches Laura as she jumps, and uses his healing powers to purge her of the virus, declaring that his purpose in X-Force is to ensure no more of his friends will die. With Vanisher in tow, X-Force returns home.X-Force #7‚Äì10 Meanwhile, Warpath returns to his tribe's reservation at Camp Verde to visit his brother's grave, but discovers the empty graves of his entire tribe before being violently attacked by the Demon Bear. Just as he's about to be killed, Warpath is saved by Ghost Rider, who offers to teach him how to kill a demon. After engaging the Demon Bear in battle once more, Ghost Rider realizes the demon is reacting to pain caused by a dagger embedded in its body. Once Warpath removes the dagger, the demon is revealed to be the spirit guides of Warpath's tribe, corrupted by the black magic of the dagger. These spirits grant Warpath a vision that reveals the history of the man responsible for digging up the graves of his tribe: Eli Bard. Warpath returns home and tells X-Force what the spirits showed him, which ends with the revelation that Eli is using the Technarch Transmode Virus to revive dead mutants as an offering to his queen, Selene.X-Force #11 Soon after, Beautiful Dreamer mysteriously dies after losing control of her powers and killing hundreds of civilians. Cyclops realizes this was likely caused by the mutated Legacy Virus, and assembles X-Force to deal with the situation. Cyclops also reveals he's in the process of tracking down Cable, and gives each of them a time-travel device that will be remotely activated when Beast determines Cable's exact location in the timestream. Fever Pitch loses control of his powers soon after, resulting in a similar massacre. While escaping the explosion, Archangel spots the Leper Queen and informs Cyclops. Once Boom-Boom, Hellion and Surge are kidnapped, the Stepford Cuckoos use Cerebra to track them down. Hellion and Surge are injected with the altered Legacy Virus and teleported out just as X-Force storm the Leper Queen's base. As Wolverine questions the Leper Queen, Cyclops informs him that Cable has been found and X-Force is being sent after him. Despite Wolverine's protests, Cyclops activates the time-travel devices, sending X-Force forward in time before they can kill the Leper Queen.X-Force #12‚Äì13 =Messiah War= X-Force is involuntarily sent to the future to retrieve Cable and Hope. The landscape is a barren, ravaged area, and the team quickly encounters danger. Apocalypse has been defeated, and Stryfe controls this future. X-Force and Cable struggle to save Hope from Bishop and Stryfe. =Not Forgotten= Not Forgotten takes place directly after X-Force's return to the present. X-23 emerges from the timestream just in time to save Boom-Boom from being killed by the Leper Queen. Seconds after she kills the Leper Queen, both she and Boom-Boom are taken into custody by agents of H.A.M.M.E.R. At the United Nations, Hellion and Surge are rescued from the Sapien League by Wolverine, Archangel and Elixir. Boom-Boom is freed from H.A.M.M.E.R. custody by Warpath, while X-23 is returned to The Facility. She wakes up to find her left arm severed by Kimura, wielding a chain saw. Before she can cut off the right arm, Kimura is shot by Agent Morales. Agent Young is revealed to be a member of The Facility that infiltrated H.A.M.M.E.R. to acquire the intel that Morales had on X-23. When Young tries to recruit Morales into The Facility, she rejects his offer by beating him unconscious. In the present, X-23 and Morales make their way to a Facility lab that holds mass amounts of the chemical trigger that forces X-23 to kill. While inside the room, X-23 cuts the claws out of her severed arm and gives them to Morales for safekeeping. She lights a Molotov cocktail of sorts which sets the sprinkler system off. The Facility soldiers finish cutting through to Laura just as Kimura realizes the sprinklers are spraying the Trigger Scent everywhere. X-23 goes feral and kills all the soldiers in her way. She gets to the Facility head's office just as the sprinklers start spraying water, washing away the scent. Kimura manages to club Laura from behind and then kills the Facility head, planning on framing Laura for it. Agent Morales arrives and sets Kimura on fire to distract her while she and Laura make her escape. Morales reveals she rigged the place to explode and they get out in time. The rest of X-Force arrives and takes Laura and her severed claws home, leading into the events of Necrosha. =Necrosha= X-Force is involved in the battle against Selene's resurrected mutant forces on Utopia, until Cyclops sends them to Genosha to kill Selene. They arrive at Necrosha and manage to rescue Warpath, who then leads them in battle against a god-like Selene, and manage to kill her using an old ritual of Warpath's tribe. Wolverine tells Cyclops that Warpath, X-23, Wolfsbane and Elixir are out of the team, but Cyclops insists that X-Force will be needed more than ever in the time ahead. =X-Men: Second Coming= X-Force is joined by Cable and Cypher on a time- traveling mission to stop an invasion of Nimrods sent from a possible dystopian future. As Cable only has one use remaining on his time-traveling device, it is believed to be a one-way suicide mission. After they complete their mission and Cable sacrifices himself to return X-Force to the present, Hope's mutant powers emerge and she destroys Bastion. After the battle, Logan is confronted by Storm about X-Force. She tells Logan that he never should have involved James, Rahne and Laura, and Logan tells her that he never wanted them involved, but doesn't regret what they did. Logan tells Laura that she's out and to figure out what she wants from life. Afterward, Logan discusses the future of X-Force with Cyclops, who decides to disband the team. Logan meets with his new team a short time later, consisting of himself, Archangel, Fantomex, Psylocke and Deadpool, deciding to run a new X-Force team without the knowledge of Cyclops or the other X-Men. Volume 4 =Dirty/Tricks= The new X-force consists of Cable, Marrow (who despite losing her powers during M-Day is repowered using a psychic headband), Psylocke, Fantomex, and Dr. Nemesis. They are investigating an explosion in Alexandria that put Hope Summers into a coma and find a new mutant nicknamed Meme, since she can only communicate through computers, as her body is comatose. They discover Russian billionaire Yevgeny-Malevitch Volga is behind Alexandria explosion and the kidnapping. He has been kidnapping mutants and supercharging them with kinetic energy and making them into human bombs. While in Paris, they pretend to kill a mutant that can read the minds of cats, so the French secret mutant forces, Le Bureaus Discret, will come to investigate, then they kidnap Le Necrogateur, a mutant that can read the minds of the deceased. Using his powers they find Volga's headquarters and that Volga found a mutant that can teleport between dimensions. Threatening the death of his family, they force the teleporting mutant to bring back a powerful weapon from Earth 1287, that creates super soldiers but greatly decreases their lifespan. During the attack on Volga's base Marrow discovers that she was pregnant during M-Day and volunteered to get her powers back, but at the cost of her pregnancy. She has a mental breakdown and X-Force is captured. It seems all is lost when Cable is super-charged and blown up by Volga. It turns out that Cable was present at Alexandria and it was him and Hope that caused the explosion when he was supercharged by Volga's henchman. Hope mimicked his powers and the chemicals caused her to fall into a coma. Cable survived the explosions since he wasn't really there‚ÄîDr. Nemesis keeps Cable locked in stasis and creates a clone of him everyday and uploads his memories. The Cable and Dr. Nemesis attack Volga's base again and teleports his supercharged henchmen into outer space and then Volga seems to commit suicide by super- charging himself and killing the Cable clone again, but Marrow creates a bone shield to protect the team. Volga's spirit survives the explosion and another Cable clone emerges from the X-Force base to mourn over Hope, who was able to manifest herself in a digital avatar by copying the powers of a brain-dead mutant, Meme. Psylocke is able to discover the switch with her psychic powers, but promises Hope that she won't tell Cable. =Hide/Fear= Cable and the X-Force who have barely survived their ordeal with Volga, track a team of British special forces into the desert. The team is tracking terrorists known as the Quaddees. It turns out Volga sold his tech to both the British and the Quaddees. X-Force begins abducting the team, but are attacked by Pete Wisdom, Meggan, and Excalibur from MI-13.X-Force Vol 4 # 8 Soon the Quaddees kidnap one member of the team, so the three groups decide to work together. Psylocke is able to find out that the super-powered British Special forces team will all die soon from Volga's tech, so the team sacrifices themselves so MI-13 and X-Force can escape. They also learn that there's a secret organization called the Yellow Eye spying on all mutants,X-Force Vol 4 # 9 who also kidnapped Domino.X-Force Vol 4 # 7 This series also retcons multiple X-Men backstories with the introduction of ForgetMeNot. His power is to immediately be forgotten by anybody who speaks with him and to be completely unnoticed by people around him unless he acknowledges them. Only Xavier knows of his existence‚Äîeven setting a psychic alarm clock to check in with ForgetMeNot every hour to remind him somebody remembers him. He hangs around the X-Mansion repelling attackers and saving the X-Men multiple times, without them realizing it and blaming it on dumb luck or deus ex machina.X-Men Legacy Issue #300 Dr. Nemesis, using an algorithm based on blurs in camera footage and missing toilet paper at the X-Mansion creates a teleporter to bring ForgetMeNot to the X-Force base on an abandoned S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. The team has great difficulty catching ForgetMeNot, since whenever he hides they forgot about him then take a coffee break, where a prerecorded video by Dr. Nemesis plays reminding them to find ForgetMeNot. This turns into a viscous cycle, almost like a time loop, until ForgetMeNot realizes that he was brought here to trick the Yellow Eye spybots (which look like tiny gnats) into allowing himself to be tracked, place a reverse tracking beacon on one and then the drone will forget him immediately and not self-destruct. This plan works; however, Fantomex then kills ForgetMeNot. Stating that he knew about him all the time since he has three brains and nanobots in his brain. Fantomex says he does it because he is evil and bored. The ships cleaning bots sweep away ForgetMeNot's body and Dr. Nemesis forgets speaking with him and assumes he figured out how to track the spybots on his own.X-Force Vol 4 # 10 =Ends/Means= The team attacks the Yellow Eye base, but during the battle Meme/Hope Summers hacks into Fantomex's consciousness, thanks to his nanobot brain, in order to learn why he broke up with her. He then reveals that he knew Hope Summers was posing as Meme. He then betrays the team and plans to use the Yellow Eye tracking technology to find his missing clones (Cluster and Weapon XIII).X-Force Vol 4 Issue #11 Luckily, it turns out Domino was brainwashed by the Yellow Eye, but Meme was able to hack into her and free her. She then shoots Fantomex in the head. It turns out Yellow Eye is actually Mojo, who reveals that Meme is actually Hope Summers to the rest of the team. Cable debates using the Yellow Eye Technology, but Psylocke wants the facility destroyed. They don't have time to debate since the second clone of Cable was already at the facility with Dr. Nemesis tracking Volga during the prior fight. The team doesn't have time to debate the morality since Fantomex was able to recode Volga's super virus code when he died and E.V.A. reloaded the virus to give her unlimited superpowers.X-Force Vol 4 Issue #12 However, since his mind is still mechanical Meme hacked into him making him think he killed the team, while they actually escaped.X-Force Vol 4 Issue #13 Back at the base Cable tricks Fantomex into fighting him, but is actually getting Fantomex to destroy various spy agencies and evil organizations. ForgetMeNot also reveals himself to Hope Summers and explains that the original Meme is still alive and saved him by transferring his consciousness and then repaired his body with the ships clean up bots. He reveals that Meme is actually dying, and once she dies Hope will not be able to copy Meme's powers and communicate with the team using her hacking powers. After Meme dies, ForgetMeNot reveals himself to the team and asks Marrow to touch Hope's body, then Hopes copies Marrow's healing factor and is able to temporarily heal herself enough to play a video showing how Cable has been manipulating the team. ForgetMeNot then pushes Psylocke into Hope, who then copies her psychic powers and reveals to the team her troubles childhood and how despite Cable saving her life by traveling between dimensions, she has outgrown him morally and doesn't look up to him. Marrow then kills the Cable clone. Hope also revealed their location to Fantomex, who is on his way to kill them.X-Force Vol 4 Issue #14 The team doesn't think they have a chance at stopping him, but Hope has a plan that will only work if they act as a team. Domino and Psylocke distract Fantomex while ForgetMeNot sneaks up to him and teleports him to Hope, who copies his super-powers, as well as the entire teams. She releases all the Cable clones against Fantomex. Hope, using Dr. Nemesis's super intellect, then figures out that Fantomex doesn't believe he is imperfect, but reveals to him that perfect requires cracks and inadequacies and perfection is really being a team. Fantomex cannot comprehend this and has a mental breakdown. Psylocke then uses her psi-blade to scramble his mind. The team later reveals they \\"fired\\" Cable from the team.X-Force Vol 4 Issue #15 Awards Issues #57‚Äì58 of the first series were part of the Onslaught storyline which was a top vote-getter for the Comics Buyer's Guide Fan Award for Favorite Comic-Book Story for 1997. The original X-Force Before the team best known as X-Force debuted, Marvel introduced an unrelated, little-known group also called X-Force. It was a short-lived group that was designed to replace Freedom Force. The members were not mutants, but received their powers artificially and were named after the X-Men. This group was organized by a government agency known as M Branch and only appeared in the pages of Cloak and Dagger #9‚Äì10 (1990). Other versions In the alternate reality of the \\"Days of Future Now\\" storyline, the X-Force consists of Banshee, Black Tom Cassidy, Cannonball, Domino, Meltdown and Omega Red. In X-Men '92, X-Force members are: Cable, Domino, Deadpool, Psylocke, Archangel and Bishop. In other media Animation X-Force is mentioned for the first time outside of the comics in the anime series Marvel Anime: X-Men. In the second episode, Professor X briefly mentions that X-Force has encountered the U-Men. No other information is given about the team, other than that they gave the X-Men all their intel about the villains. In an early episode of Beavis and Butt-Head the duo vandalize their neighbor's house by painting \\"X-FORCE RULES\\" on it. Film 20th Century Fox were developing a film version of X-Force. On July 11, 2013, it was reported that Jeff Wadlow has been hired to write and direct the adaptation. Lauren Shuler Donner and Matthew Vaughn would produce. On December 3, 2013, Rob Liefeld confirmed that Cable and Deadpool would be appearing in the film. The film was planned to be released sometime in the year 2017. A piece of concept art shows Cable, Domino, Warpath, Cannonball, and Feral as members of the team. After the release of Deadpool, Reynolds felt that Deadpool would soon be in an X-Force film, and Kinberg stated that there was potential for X-Force to be R-rated like Deadpool in contrast to the PG-13 \\"mainline X-Men movies\\". Bryan Singer stated in an interview with Fandango that he would like to see X-23 to appear in the film as the new Wolverine. In addition, Psylocke was rumored to appear in the film as she is a very prominent member of the team in the comic books; however, actress Olivia Munn (who plays Psylocke in the film X-Men: Apocalypse) has not addressed these rumors. On November 9, 2016, Kinberg announced to The Hollywood Reporter that the film was still on their schedule. In February 2017, it was reported that Ryan Reynolds would co-write the script with Joe Carnahan. On September 7, 2017, Drew Goddard was brought on to write and direct X-Force. On February 21, 2018, Hollywood North Buzz reported that the film would start shooting that October before the Disney/Fox deal was finalised. X-Force appears in Deadpool 2, when Deadpool declares that his new team will be known as X-Force to combat Cable. Besides Deadpool, the group consists of Domino, Bedlam, Shatterstar, Zeitgeist, Vanisher, and a non-mutant man named Peter. All team members except Deadpool and Domino are killed off one by one, in humorously grisly fashion, briefly after the start of their very first mission, when they parachute into such obstacles as a bus (Bedlam), helicopter blades (Shatterstar), a wood-chipper (Zeitgeist), electric cables (the Vanisher) and being vomited on by Zeitgeist's mutant acid vomit (Peter). In the post-credits scene, however, Deadpool uses Cable's time-travel device to travel back in time and successfully prevents Peter, who he has come to like, from meeting his gruesome end. Following the release of Deadpool 2 in May 2018, co-writer Rhett Reese confirmed the X-Force movie would be an R-rated take on X-Men and would have \\"all the sex, violence, and silliness one would expect from the Deadpool-skewed militarized mutant force\\". Reese said \\"they can get their hands dirty a little bit. There's more gray area. It'll be raunchier, it'll be rated R, I'm sure. We'll get to see an ensemble movie that's pushed, hopefully, as far as the Deadpool individual movie was pushed.\\" On February 5, 2019, Lauren Shuler Donner revealed that X-Force, as well as the rest of the Fox Marvel films, were \\"on hold\\" until the Disney-Fox deal went through. Video games The team (consisting of Domino, Fantomex and Archangel) appear in Deadpool's ending in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. They are shown celebrating Deadpool's victory over Galactus alongside Cable, Bob, Agent of HYDRA and several Capcom characters. A group of them also appear in a Fortnite event. Miscellaneous In April 2010, the popular Web comic Homestar Runner featured a parody titled Xeriouxly Forxe, in which all of the site's main characters except Homsar were re-designed to look like X-Men.

Matford Alsace V8 (1936) In the early 1930s, the Ford Motor Company was quickly expanding its European production, while Mathis had financial problems, but also a large factory at Strasbourg (which, following frontier changes formalized in 1919, was now in France). Ford were keen to increase production and the Mathis plant in Strasbourg seemed more suitable than their existing workshop in Asni√®res-sur-Seine. A joint venture between Ford and Mathis was created under the name of Matford S.A., formally created on 1 October 1934, and owned by Ford and Matthis in the proportion 60:40. The initial cars were locally assembled versions of contemporary American and British Ford models. The intention had been expressed to produce the Matford models alongside those from Mathis but the last Mathis was actually made in October 1934, which was also the month in which Matford was formally founded. During 1935, under the energetic direction of Maurice Dollfus who had joined Ford in 1930, Ford poured massive amounts of capital into modernising the Strasbourg plant. There were high hopes for the Matford collaboration which, in 1934, was expected to last for fifty years. In 1935 a range of V-8 engined Matfords was put on the market which were very similar to the American Ford Model 48s with their V-8 3622cc engines. A French version appeared in 1936 as the model that has come to be known as the Matford Alsace, with a choice of a 2,225 or 3,621 cc V-8 engine: a cabriolet was also listed. The 1937 models were generally known at the time simply as the Matford 13CV and the Matford 21CV which followed the convention of the time by using the cars' fiscal horse power ratings as model names. Both featured a V-shaped windscreen and in 1938 a US style timber bodied estate car joined the range. The steel car bodies were purchased from the coachbuilders Chausson rather than being built inhouse. Volume passenger car production ended in 1940 with the buildup of truck orders for the French army, though an unknown number were made during the German occupation, at least till 1942. Under the occupation, because of its proximity to the German border, the contents of the Matford Stasbourg factory were moved to Ford's Cologne plant, while a new Ford plant opened at Poissy near Paris in 1940. Ford links with Mathis were severed. Ford's French business was restructured in 1940, now taking the name Ford Soci√©t√© Anonyme Fran√ßaise and this company used the Ford trademark. √âmile Mathis, fearing persecution under German occupation, escaped to the United States where he spent the war, while Matford ceased to exist. Matford cars achieved success at the Coupe de Dames (1936) and at Monte Carlo (1938).

Background   Family  Israel Finkelstein was born in Tel Aviv, Israel, on March 29, 1949. His parents were Zvi (Grisha) Finkelstein (born 1908) and Miriam Finkelstein (maiden name Ellenhorn, born 1910). His great grandfather on his mother's side, Shlomo Ellenhorn, came to Palestine from Grodno (today in Belarus) in the 1850s and settled in Hebron. He was one of the first physicians in the Bikur Cholim Hospital in Jerusalem, and is listed among the group of people who purchased the land in 1878 in order to establish Petah Tikva ‚Äì the first modern Jewish settlement in Palestine outside the four holy cities. Finkelstein's grandfather, Israel Jacob Ellenhorn, was the first pharmacist in Petah Tikva. Finkelstein‚Äôs father was born in Melitopol (Ukraine). He came to Palestine with his family in 1920. He was in the orange-growing business and was active in the sports organisations of Israel. He served as vice chairman of the Israel Football Association, chairman of Maccabi Israel and was a member of the Israel Olympic Committee. Finkelstein is married to Joelle (maiden name Cohen). They are the parents of two daughters ‚Äì Adar (born 1992) and Sarai (born 1996). Education Israel Finkelstein attended the PICA elementary school (1956‚Äì1963) and Ahad Ha'am High School (1963‚Äì1967), both in Petah Tikva. He then served in the Israel Defense Forces (1967‚Äì1970). He studied archaeology and Near Eastern civilizations, and geography at Tel Aviv University, receiving his BA in 1974. While there, Finkelstein was a student of Prof. Yohanan Aharoni. He continued as a research student under the supervision of Prof. Moshe Kochavi, receiving his MA in 1978 (thesis on Rural Settlement in the Yarkon Basin in the Iron Age and Persian-Hellenistic Periods). He graduated as a PhD in 1983 with a thesis titled \\"The Izbet Sartah Excavations and the Israelite Settlement in the Hill Country\\".  Academic career  From 1976 to 1990, Finkelstein taught at the Department of Land of Israel Studies, Bar-Ilan University, beginning as a teaching assistant. He spent the academic year of 1983‚Äì84 in a research group led by Prof. Yigael Yadin in the Institute of Advanced Studies in the Hebrew University, Jerusalem. In 1986 and 1987, Finkelstein taught at the Department for Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, University of Chicago. In 1987 he was appointed an associate professor with tenure at Bar-Ilan University and in 1990 moved to the Department of Archaeology and Ancient Near Eastern Civilizations at Tel Aviv University. In 1992/93 Finkelstein spent a sabbatical year as a visiting scholar at the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, Harvard University. Since 1992, he has been a Full Professor at Tel Aviv University. He served as the chairperson of the Department of Archaeology and Near Eastern Studies (1994‚Äì98) and as Director of The Sonia and Marco Nadler Institute of Archaeology (1996‚Äì2003). In 1998‚Äì99 Finkelstein was a visiting scholar in the Centre de Recherche d‚ÄôArch√©ologie Orientale and the √âcole Pratique des Hautes √âtudes in the Sorbonne, Paris.

Scholarly contributions  Finkelstein has written on a variety of topics, including the archaeology of the Bronze Age and the exact and life sciences contribution to archaeology. Much of his work has been devoted to the Iron Age and, more specifically, to questions related to the history of Ancient Israel.  The Emergence of Ancient Israel  The classical theories on the emergence of Israel viewed the process as a unique event in the history of the region. Finkelstein suggested that we are dealing with a long-term process of a cyclical nature. He demonstrated that the wave of settlement in the highlands in the Iron Age I (ca. 1150-950 BCE) was the last in a series of such demographic developments ‚Äì the first had taken place in the Early Bronze and the second in the Middle Bronze. The periods between these peaks were characterized by low settlement activity. Finkelstein explained these oscillations as representing changes along the sedentary/ pastoral-nomadic continuum, which were caused by socioeconomic and political dynamics. Hence, a big portion of the people who settled in the highlands in the early Iron Age were locals of a pastoral-nomadic background. Others, who originated from local sedentary background, moved to the highlands as a result of the Bronze Age collapse ‚Äì which in turn was related to a long period of dry climate in ca. 1250-1100 BCE. Since eventually these groups formed the Northern Kingdom of Israel, they can be labeled \\"Israelites\\" as early as their initial settlement process. The same holds true for the contemporary settlement process in Transjordan and western Syria, which brought about the rise of Moab, Ammon and the Aramean kingdoms of the later phases of the Iron Age.For the rise of Ancient Israel: I. Finkelstein, The Archaeology of the Israelite Settlement, Jerusalem 1988; idem, The Great Transformation: The 'Conquest' of the Highlands Frontiers and the Rise of the Territorial States, in T.E. Levy (ed.), The Archaeology of Society in the Holy Land, Leicester 1995, pp. 349-365. Finkelstein regards the biblical account on the Conquest of Canaan in the Book of Joshua as an ideological manifesto of the Deuteronomistic author/s of the late 7th century BCE, describing a \\"conquest to be\\" under King Josiah of Judah rather than a historical event at the end of the Bronze Age. He proposed that the original Conquest Account may have originated in the Northern Kingdom of Israel in the early 8th century BCE; it could have been influenced by memories of the turmoil that had taken place in the lowlands in the late Iron I (10th century BCE), rather than the end of the Late Bronze Age (late 12th century BCE).For the biblical account on the Conquest of Canaan: I. Finkelstein and N.A. Silberman, The Bible Unearthed, Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of its Sacred Texts, New York 2001, pp. 72-96; I. Finkelstein, A Corpus of North Israelite Texts in the Days of Jeroboam II? Forthcoming in Hebrew Bible and Ancient Israel.  The Low Chronology  Until the 1990s, the chronology of the Iron Age in the Levant had been anchored in the biblical account of the great United Monarchy of David and Solomon. Accordingly, the Iron I ended ca. 1000 BCE and the Iron IIA was dated from 1000 BCE until the campaign of Pharaoh Sheshonq I (biblical Shishak) ca. 925 BCE. The two Iron IIA palaces at Megiddo were conceived as the material manifestation for the Solomonic Empire.For instance, Y. Yadin, Megiddo of the Kings of Israel, Biblical Archaeologist 33 (1970), pp. 65-96. While preparing for the excavations at Megiddo in the early 1990s, Finkelstein noticed difficulties in this scheme. Noteworthy among them is the appearance of similar traits of material culture at Megiddo in a layer that was dated to the time of King Solomon in the middle of the 10th century, and at Samaria and Jezreel in contexts dated to the time of the Omride Dynasty (of the Northern Kingdom of Israel) in the early 9th century BCE. To resolve these difficulties, Finkelstein proposed to \\"lower\\" the dates of the Iron Age strata in the Levant by several decades.I. Finkelstein, The Archaeology of the United Monarchy: An Alternative View, Levant 28 (1996), pp. 177-187. According to Finkelstein's Low Chronology, the Iron Age I lasted until the middle of the 10th century BCE, while the Iron IIA is dated between the middle of the 10th century and ca. 800 BCE, if not slightly later. This means that the Megiddo palaces and other features which had traditionally been attributed to the time of King Solomon ‚Äì features which date to the late Iron IIA ‚Äì should indeed be associated with the endeavors of the Omride Dynasty in the first half of the 9th century BCE. A big debate ensued.For instance, A. Mazar, Iron Age Chronology: A Reply to I. Finkelstein, Levant 29 (1997), pp. 157-167. Starting in the late 1990s, the focus of the discussion shifted to the interpretation of radiocarbon determinations for organic samples from key sites, such as Tel Rehov and Megiddo. All in all, the radiocarbon results put the Iron I/IIA transition ca. the middle of the 10th century (rather than 1000 BCE as had traditionally been proposed), and the Iron IIA/B transition in the early days of the 8th century (rather than ca. 925 BCE).For instance, I. Finkelstein and E. Piasetzky, Radiocarbon Dating the Iron Age in the Levant: A Bayesian Model for Six Ceramic Phases and Six Transitions, Antiquity 84 (2010), pp. 374‚Äì385. Iron Age Chronology Debate: Is the Gap Narrowing? Another Viewpoint, Near Eastern Archaeology 74 (2011), pp. 105-111. In parallel, and not directly connected, Finkelstein dealt with the chronology of Philistine pottery of the Iron Age I. The traditional theory fixed the appearance of Philistine pottery ‚Äì and hence the settlement of the Philistines in the southern coastal plain of the Levant ‚Äì in accordance with the confrontation between Ramses III and the Sea Peoples in the early 12th century BCE. In other words, Philistine pottery appears during the last phase of Egyptian rule in Canaan.A. Mazar, The Emergence of the Philistine Culture. Israel Exploration Journal 35 (1985), pp. 95‚Äì107; L.E. Stager, The Impact of the Sea Peoples in Canaan (1185-1050 BCE), in T.E. Levy (ed.), Archaeology of Society in the Holy Land. London 1995, pp. 332‚Äì348. Finkelstein proposed that the locally-made Monochrome pottery known from several sites in Philistia, which is widely understood as representing the earliest phase of Philistine settlement, should be dated after the withdrawal of Egypt from Canaan in the 1130s.I. Finkelstein, The Date of the Philistine Settlement in Canaan, Tel Aviv 22 (1995), pp. 213-239; for radiocarbon results see I. Finkelstein and E. Piasetzky, Radiocarbon Dating Khirbet Qeiyafa and the Iron I-IIA Phases in the Shephelah: Methodological Comments and a Bayesian Model, Radiocarbon 57 (2015), pp. 891‚Äì907. Finkelstein sees the biblical description of the time of David and Solomon as multilayered. He acknowledges the historicity of the founders of the Davidic Dynasty, places them in the 10th century BCE, and considers the possibility that the description of the rise of David to power conceals old memories of his activity as a leader of an Apiru-band that was active in the southern fringe of Judah. Yet, he sees the description of a great United Monarchy as an ideological construct that represents the ideology of late-monarchic author/s in the late 7th century BCE, first and foremost the pan-Israelite ideology of the days of King Josiah of Judah. According to him, the historical David and Solomon ruled over a small territory in the southern highlands ‚Äì a territory not very different from that of Jerusalem of the Late Bronze Age. Finkelstein sees much of the description of King Solomon as representing realities from late monarchic times: First, from the later days of the Northern Kingdom (for instance, the reference to Megiddo, Hazor and Gezer in 1 Kings 9:15 and to the stables, horses and chariots of Solomon). Second, from the time of King Manasseh of Judah in the early 7th century BCE, under Assyrian domination (for instance, the visit of the Queen of Sheba in Jerusalem).I. Finkelstein and N.A. Silberman, David and Solomon: In Search of the Bible's Sacred Kings and the Roots of the Western Tradition, New York 2006, pp. 151-178. He understands the description of the Philistines in the Bible as portraying realities in Philistia in late-monarchic times.I. Finkelstein, The Philistines in the Bible: A Late-Monarchic Perspective, Journal for the Study of the Old Testament 27 (2002), pp. 131-167.  \\"New Canaan\\"  Following the results of the excavations at Megiddo, Finkelstein argued that the material culture of the Iron I in the northern valleys continues that of the Late Bronze Age. In other words, the collapse of the Late Bronze city-states under Egyptian domination in the late 12th century BCE was followed by revival of some of the same centers and rise of others in the Iron I. He termed this phenomenon \\"New Canaan\\".I. Finkelstein, City States and States: Polity Dynamics in the 10th-9th Centuries B.C.E, in W.G. Dever and S. Gitin (eds.), Symbiosis, Symbolism and the Power of the Past: Canaan, Ancient Israel, and their Neighbors, Winona Lake 2003, pp. 75-83. Accordingly, the major break in the material culture of Canaan took place at the end of the Iron I in the 10th century BCE rather than the end of the Late Bronze Age. Finkelstein associated the violent destruction of the revived city-states with the expansion of the highlanders (early Israelites). He suggested that memories of the turmoil in the lowlands in the late Iron I can be found in northern traditions regarding skirmishes with Canaanite cities which appear in the heroic stories in the Book of Judges.For instance, I. Finkelstein, Historical-Geographical Observations on the Ehud-Eglon Tale in Judges, in I. Finkelstein, T. R√∂mer and C. Robin (eds.), Alphabets, Texts and Artefacts in the Ancient Near East, Studies Presented to Benjamin Sass, Paris 2016, pp. 100-108.  The Northern Kingdom  Finkelstein dealt with a variety of themes related to the archeology and history of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. He proposed that the first North Israelite territorial polity emerged in the Gibeon-Bethel plateau in the late Iron I and early Iron IIA. He found archaeological evidence for this in the system of fortified sites, such as Tell en-Nasbeh, Khirbet ed- Dawwara, et-Tell (\\"Ai\\") and Gibeon. Historical evidence for the existence of this polity can be found in the campaign of Pharaoh Sheshonq I in this region in the middle-to-second half of the 10th century BCE. According to Finkelstein, positive memories in the Bible of the House of Saul, which originated from the North, represent this early Israelite entity. He suggested that this north Israelite polity ruled over much of the territory of the highlands, that it presented a threat to the interests of Egypt of the 22nd Dynasty in Canaan, and that it was taken over during the campaign of Sheshonq I.I. Finkelstein, The Forgotten Kingdom: The Archaeology and History of Northern Israel, Atlanta 2013, pp. 37-61. Finkelstein proposed that in its early days, the Northern Kingdom (Jeroboam I and his successors) ruled over the Samaria Highlands, the western slopes of the Gilead and the area of the Jezreel Valley. The expansion of Israel further to the north came during the days of the Omride Dynasty in the first half of the 9th century BCE, and even more so in the time of Jeroboam II in the first half of the 8th century BCE. Finkelstein described the special features of Omride architecture and, with his Megiddo team, dealt with different subjects related to the material culture of the Northern Kingdom, such as metallurgy and cult practices. Finkelstein also reflected on biblical traditions related to the Northern Kingdom, such as the Jacob cycle in Genesis (a study carried out with Thomas R√∂mer), the Exodus tradition, the heroic stories in the Book of Judges and remnants of royal traditions in the Books of Samuel and Kings.I. Finkelstein, Jeroboam, above n. 2. He suggested that these North Israelite traditions were first committed to writing in the days of Jeroboam II (first half of the 8th century BCE), that they were brought to Judah with Israelite refugees after the takeover of Israel by Assyria, and that they were later incorporated into the Judahite-dominated Bible. Finkelstein sees the biblical genre of deploying \\"history\\" in the service of royal ideology as emerging from Israel (the North) of the 8th century BCE.  Archaeology and history of Jerusalem  Finkelstein has recently dealt with the location of the ancient mound of Jerusalem (with Ido Koch and Oded Lipschits). The conventional wisdom sees that \\"City of David\\" ridge as the location of the original settlement of Jerusalem. Finkelstein and his colleagues argued that the \\"City of David\\" ridge does not have the silhouette of a mound; that it is located in topographical inferiority relative to the surrounding area; and that the archaeological record of the ridge does not include periods of habitation attested in reliable textual records. According to them, the most suitable location for the core of ancient Jerusalem is the Temple Mount. The large area of the Herodian platform (today's Harem esh-Sharif) may conceal a mound of five hectares and more, which ‚Äì similar to other capital cities in the Levant ‚Äì included both the royal compound and habitation quarters. Locating the mound of Ancient Jerusalem on the Temple Mound resolves many of the difficulties pertaining to the \\"City of David\\" ridge.I. Finkelstein, I. Koch and O. Lipschits, The Mound on the Mount: A Solution to the ‚ÄúProblem with Jerusalem‚Äù? Journal of Hebrew Scriptures 11 (2011, Article 12). According to Finkelstein, the history of Jerusalem in biblical times should be viewed in terms of three main phases: Firstly, until the 9th century BCE, Jerusalem was restricted to the mound on the Temple Mount and ruled over a modest area in the southern highlands. Accordingly, Jerusalem of the time of David and Solomon can be compared to Jerusalem of the Amarna period in the 14th century BCE: it had the size of a typical highlands mound (for instance, Shechem), ruled over a restricted area, but still had impact beyond the highlands. Secondly, the first expansion of Jerusalem came in the 9th century BCE, perhaps in its second half, when the town grew significantly in a southerly direction. Remains of the Iron IIA were unearthed south of al-Aqsa Mosque, above the Gihon Spring and to the south of the Dung Gate of the Old City. In parallel to this development, Judah expanded to the Shephelah in the west and Beer-sheba Valley in the south, and for the first time became a territorial kingdom rather than a city-state restricted to the highlands. Thirdly, the most impressive phase in the settlement history of Jerusalem commenced in the late 8th century BCE and lasted until its destruction by the Babylonians in 586 BCE. At that time Jerusalem expanded dramatically, to include the entire \\"City of David\\" ridge, as well as the \\"Western Hill\\" (the Armenian and Jewish Quarter of today's Old City). This expansion was the result of the arrival of Israelite refugees after the demise of the Northern Kingdom in 722-720 BCE. These groups brought with them traits of Northern material culture, and more important ‚Äì their foundation myths, royal traditions and heroic stories. These Northern traditions were later incorporated into the Judahite Bible.  Jerusalem and Yehud/Judea of the Persian and Hellenistic periods  Finkelstein noted that in the Persian Period, Jerusalem was limited to the mound on the Temple Mount ‚Äì and even there was sparsely settled ‚Äì and that Yehud of that time was also thinly settled. As the description of the construction of the wall of Jerusalem in Nehemiah 3 must relate to the big city (extending beyond the old mound on the Temple Mount), it probably portrays the construction of the fortifications by the Hasmoneans. Finkelstein further noted that many of the sites mentioned in the lists of returnees in Ezra and Nehemiah were not inhabited in the Persian Period and hence sees these lists as reflecting the demographic situation in days of the Hasmoneans. The same holds true, in his opinion, for the genealogies in 1 Chronicles.I. Finkelstein, Jerusalem in the Persian (and Early Hellenistic) Period and the Wall of Nehemiah, Journal for the Study of the Old Testament 32 (2008), pp. 501-520; idem, The Archaeology of the List of Returnees in Ezra and Nehemiah, Palestine Exploration Quarterly 140 (2008), pp. 7-16. Finkelstein then looked into the accounts of Judahite monarchs in 2 Chronicles, which do not appear in Kings. He called attention to similarities between these texts and 1 Maccabees, and proposed to understand Chronicles as representing legitimacy needs of the Hasmoneans. This means that at least 2 Chronicles dates to the late 2nd century BCE, probably to the days of John Hyrcanus.I.

The select committee noted that he is \\"widely regarded as a leading scholar in the archaeology of the Levant and as a foremost applicant of archaeological knowledge to reconstructing biblical Israelite history. He excels at creatively forging links between archaeology and the exact sciences and he has revolutionized many of these fields. ‚Ä¶ Finkelstein has had an impact on radically revising the history of Israel in the 10th and 9th centuries BCE. He has transformed the study of history and archaeology in Israeli universities, moving from a ‚Äòmonumental‚Äô to a ‚Äòsystemic‚Äô study of the archaeological evidence. He has taken what was becoming a rather staid and conservative discipline, with everyone in general agreement as to interpretation of excavation results, and has turned things upside down. ‚Ä¶ The study of these periods is never again going to be what it once was. ‚Ä¶ Israel Finkelstein has proven to be creative, generating scholarship no less than discussion, launching ideas and stimulating debates, fearlessly but with imagination and grace.\\" In 2014, Finkelstein was awarded the Prix Delalande Gu√©rineau: Institut de France, l'Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, for his book Le Royaume biblique oubli√© (The Forgotten Kingdom).https://english.tau.ac.il/news/Prix_Delalande-Guerineau His other awards include the French decoration of Chevalier de l‚Äôordre des Arts et des Lettres, (2009) and the Doctorat honoris causa of the University of Lausanne (2010).

Matthews was the Court's 46th justice, appointed by President James A. Garfield. Early life and education Matthews was born July 21, 1824, in Cincinnati, Ohio. He was the oldest of 11 children born to Thomas J. Matthews and Isabella Brown Matthews (his second wife). He graduated from Kenyon College in 1840. While there he met future president of the United States Rutherford B. Hayes and close friend John Celivergos Zachos. Matthews moved to his hometown Cincinnati with Zachos. Zachos and Matthews were roommates. In Cincinnati Matthews studied law under Salmon P. Chase but he moved to Columbia, Tennessee, where he practiced law and edited the local newspaper. Matthews returned to Cincinnati in 1844, and was admitted to the bar the following year.. In Cincinnati Matthews edited the antislavery newspaper Cincinnati Morning Herald and practiced law. \\"Topping, Eva Catafygiotu\\" John Zachos Cincinnatian from Constantinople The Cincinnati Historical Society Bulletin Volumes 33-34 Cincinnati Historical Society 1975: p. 51 In 1849, Stanley Matthews, John Celivergos Zachos, Ainsworth Rand Spofford and 9 others founded the Literary Club of Cincinnati. One year later President Rutherford B. Hayes became a member. Other prominent members included President William Howard Taft and notable club guests Ralph Waldo Emerson, Booker T. Washington, Mark Twain, Charles Dickens, Oscar Wilde and Robert Frost. Topping, 1975, p. 54 Early legal career Matthews was selected to serve as the clerk of the Ohio House of Representatives in 1848, and afterward served as a county judge in Hamilton County, Ohio. He was then elected to the Ohio State Senate for the 1st district, where he served from 1856 to 1858. He was then appointed as United States Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, serving from 1858 to 1861. Union officer Matthews resigned as U.S. Attorney as the Civil War began, accepting a commission as lieutenant colonel with the 23rd Ohio Infantry regiment of the Union Army. His superior officer was Rutherford B. Hayes; future President William McKinley also served in the regiment. With the 23rd Ohio Regiment, Matthews fought at the battle of Carnifex Ferry. On October 26, 1861 he was appointed colonel of the 51st Ohio Infantry Regiment. and on April 11, 1862 he was nominated as brigadier general of U.S. Volunteers. However, the nomination was tabled and never confirmed. Nevertheless, Colonel Matthews commanded a brigade in the Army of the Ohio and later the Army of the Cumberland. State judge, lawyer and politician In 1863, after being elected a judge of Superior Court of Cincinnati, Matthews resigned from the Union Army. Two years later, he returned to private practice. During the post-war reconstruction era, Matthews represented the railroad industry. His clients included Jay Gould. He ran for the United States House of Representatives in 1876, but was defeated. Then, in early 1877, he represented Rutherford B. Hayes before the electoral commission that Congress created to resolve the disputed 1876 presidential election. That same year Matthews won a special election to the Senate to fill a vacancy created by the resignation of John Sherman. He did not seek reelection. Associate justice President Hayes first nominated Matthews as an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court on January 26, 1881, in the last weeks of Hayes's presidency. The nomination ran into opposition in the U.S. Senate because of Matthews's close ties to railroad interests and due to his close long-term friendship with Hayes. Consequently, the Judiciary Committee took no action on the nomination during the remainder of the 46th Congress. Upon succeeding Hayes, President James A. Garfield swiftly re-nominated Matthews to the CourtMarch 14, 1881, just 10 days after taking office. Though a new nomination from a new president, earlier concerns about Matthews's suitability for the Court persisted, and Garfield was widely criticized for re-submitting Matthews's name. In spite of the opposition, and, although the Judiciary Committee made a recommendation to the Senate that it reject the nomination, on May 12, the Senate voted 24‚Äì23 to confirm Matthews. The vote was the closest for any successful Supreme Court nominee in U.S. Senate history; no other justice has been confirmed by a single vote. Matthews's tenure as a member of the Supreme Court began on May 17, 1881, when he took the judicial oath, and ended March 22, 1889, upon his death. He was regarded as one of the more progressive justices on the Court at the time. Yick Wo v. Hopkins In 1880, the elected officials of city of San Francisco, California thought they had a clever way to deal with the Chinese in the city. They passed an ordinance that persons could not operate a laundry in a wooden building without a permit from the Board of Supervisors. The ordinance conferred upon the Board of Supervisors the discretion to grant or withhold the permits. At the time, about 95% of the city's 320 laundries were operated in wooden buildings. Approximately two-thirds of those laundries were owned by Chinese persons. Although most of the city's wooden building laundry owners applied for a permit, none were granted to any Chinese owner, while virtually all non-Chinese applicants were granted a permit. Yick Wo (ÁõäÂíå, Pinyin: Y√¨ H√©, Americanization: Lee Yick), who had lived in California and had operated a laundry in the same wooden building for many years and held a valid license to operate his laundry issued by the Board of Fire-Wardens, continued to operate his laundry and was convicted and fined $10.00 for violating the ordinance. He sued for a writ of habeas corpus after he was imprisoned in default for having refused to pay the fine. The Court, in a unanimous opinion written by Justice Matthews, found that the administration of the statute in question was discriminatory and that there was therefore no need to even consider whether the ordinance itself was lawful. Even though the Chinese laundry owners were usually not American citizens, the court ruled they were still entitled to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Matthews also noted that the court had previously ruled that it was acceptable to hold administrators of the law liable when they abused their authority. He denounced the law as a blatant attempt to exclude Chinese from the laundry trade in San Francisco, and the court struck down the law, ordering dismissal of all charges against other laundry owners who had been jailed. Personal life In 1843, Matthews married Mary Ann \\"Minnie\\" Black. They had 10 children, four of whom died during an outbreak of scarlet fever in 1859. Over a three-week period, the outbreak claimed the lives of their three eldest sons (9-year-old Morrison, 6-year-old Stanley, and 4-year-old Thomas) as well as younger daughter Mary (age two-and-a-half). Oldest daughter Isabella (7 at the time) and baby William Mortimer survived the devastating outbreak, although Isabella would die in 1868 at the age of sixteen. Their four younger children (Grace, Eva, Jane, and another son named Stanley, later called Paul) were born after the scarlet fever outbreak. Matthews' wife, Mary Ann \\"Minnie\\", died in Washington D.C. on January 22, 1885 at age 63. Matthews married Mrs. Mary K. Theaker, widow of Thomas Clarke Theaker, on June 23, 1886 in New York. Death and legacy Matthews' health declined precipitously during 1888; he died in Washington D.C. on March 22, 1889. He was survived by second wife Mary, as well as five of his children with Minnie: Mortimer, Grace, Eva, Jane, and Paul. He is interred at Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati, Ohio.

It first aired on the NBC network in the United States on October 6, 1994. This episode sees Chandler (Matthew Perry) pick up his old smoking addiction, a habit that the rest of the group finds hard to get him to break. Only Alan (Geoffrey Lower), the new boyfriend of Monica (Courteney Cox), can convince Chandler to drop the habit. The gang falls in love with Alan, but Monica doesn't see a future with him and the two break up, much to the disappointment of the friends. Meanwhile, Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) struggles to get rid of all the free money she's receiving, including $7,000 from a soda company when she finds a severed thumb in her drink. She uses the money to pay Chandler to stop smoking. Plot At the beginning of the episode, Chandler helps Joey rehearse for an audition. The rehearsal calls for Joey to smoke a cigarette, and as Joey is not a smoker and coughs after taking a drag, Chandler, who used to smoke, demonstrates the \\"proper\\" smoking technique to Joey. But as he begins to take a few drags, he becomes addicted and picks up his old habit again. Throughout the episode, the gang try to persuade him to quit, which irritates him greatly. He defends himself by saying it is just a flaw of his, and claims that they are being hypocritical, as they all have their own irritating habits (e.g. Monica's snorting, Joey's knuckle-cracking, Phoebe chewing her hair). Phoebe discovers her bank has accidentally credited her with an extra $500. The gang persuades her to keep the money, but she decides to return it. However, instead of taking back the money, the bank gives her another $500 and a football phone. Not wanting to keep either the money or the phone, she gives both to Lizzy, a homeless woman. Lizzy buys a soda for Phoebe, who, upon opening the can, discovers a severed thumb floating in the soda. The soda company gives Phoebe $7,000. Monica is afraid to introduce her new boyfriend Alan to the gang for fear of them ridiculing him and driving him away, as they have apparently done in the past with her other dates. Much to her surprise, the gang can find no fault with Alan, and enjoy his company very much. Alan even convinces Chandler to stop smoking in a very brief telephone conversation after repeated failed attempts by the gang. However, Monica does not quite share the gang's enthusiasm for Alan, and decides to break up with him. Ironically, he tells her that he cannot stand the gang. Monica does not tell them about this in order to spare their feelings. Chandler tries using patches to quit smoking, but gives up at the end of the episode, and announces he is getting cigarettes. Phoebe then offers him the $7,000 in return for not smoking again; Chandler gladly obliges. Production Although Chandler is the only smoker in the series, everyone of the main cast (except David Schwimmer) are smokers in real life. Reception In the original broadcast, the episode was viewed by 19.5 million viewers. Sam Ashurst from Digital Spy ranked it #124 on their ranking of the 236 Friends episodes, and called it a \\"strong, early episode\\". Telegraph & Argus also ranked \\"The One with the Thumb\\" #124 on their ranking of the 236 Friends episodes. They wrote that the show stealer was Chandler's line \\"Oh, Satan‚Äôs minions at work again‚Ä¶\\". The A.V. Club wrote, \\"the Alan storyline is pretty great, particularly because it extends that sense from the first episode that Monica's friends are all very invested in her love life\\".

The 4,554-acre (1,843 ha) park, including the marble cave, is 20 miles (32 km) east of Cave Junction, on Oregon Route 46. The protected area, managed by the National Park Service (NPS), is in southwestern Josephine County, near the Oregon‚ÄìCalifornia border. Elijah Davidson, a resident of nearby Williams, discovered the cave in 1874. Over the next two decades, private investors failed in efforts to run successful tourist ventures at the publicly owned site. After passage of the Antiquities Act by the United States Congress, in 1909 President William Howard Taft established Oregon Caves National Monument, to be managed by the United States Forest Service (USFS). The growing popularity of the automobile, construction of paved highways, and promotion of tourism by boosters from Grants Pass led to large increases in cave visitation during the late 1920s and thereafter. Among the attractions at the remote monument is the Oregon Caves Chateau, a six-story hotel built in a rustic style in 1934. It is a National Historic Landmark and is part of the Oregon Caves Historic District within the monument. The NPS, which assumed control of the monument in 1933, offers tours of the cave from mid-April through early November. In 2014, the protected area was expanded by about and re-designated a National Monument and Preserve. At the same time, the segment of the creek that flows through the cave was renamed for the mythological Styx and added to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Oregon Caves is a solutional cave, with passages totaling about , formed in marble. The parent rock was originally limestone that metamorphosed to marble during the geologic processes that created the Klamath Mountains, including the Siskiyous. Although the limestone formed about 190 million years ago, the cave itself is no older than a few million years. Valued as a tourist cave, the cavern also has scientific value; sections of the cave that are not on tour routes contain fossils of national importance. Activities at the park include cave touring, hiking, photography, and wildlife viewing. One of the park trails leads through the forest to Big Tree, which at is the widest Douglas fir known in Oregon. Lodging and food are available at The Chateau and in Cave Junction. Camping is available in the preserve at the Cave Creek Campground, at a local USFS campground, and private sites in the area. Geography Map of the cave Oregon Caves National Monument and Preserve is in the Siskiyou Mountains, a coastal range that is part of the Klamath Mountains of northwestern California and southwestern Oregon. The monument consists of in the Rogue River ‚Äì Siskiyou National Forest, about north of the Oregon‚ÄìCalifornia border in Josephine County. Elevations within the monument range from . Mount Elijah in the preserve rises to . In December 2014, the U.S. Congress enlarged the protected area that includes the cave and changed its name from Oregon Caves National Monument to Oregon Caves National Monument and Preserve. The preserve covers , and both it and the monument, which abuts the preserve, are administered by the same staff. By highway, Oregon Caves is southwest of Grants Pass, south of Portland and north of San Francisco. The caves are east of the small city of Cave Junction via Oregon Route 46 off U.S. Route 199. The main cave has known passages totaling about in length. Eight separate smaller caves have also been discovered in the monument. Runoff from the heavily wooded monument forms small headwater streams of the Illinois River, a major tributary of the Rogue River. One of five small springs in the monument becomes Upper Cave Creek, which flows on the surface before disappearing into its bed and entering the cave. Supplemented by water entering the cave from above, the stream emerges from the main entrance as Cave Creek. Within the cave, Cave Creek is known as the River Styx, named for the river Styx of Greek mythology connecting Earth to the Underworld. In late 2014, Congress added the River Styx to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, which added a level of protection aimed at keeping the stream free-flowing in perpetuity. It is the only subterranean river in the Wild Rivers system. History Archeologists believe the first humans to inhabit the Rogue River region were nomadic hunters and gatherers. Radiocarbon dating suggests that they arrived in southwestern Oregon at least 8,500 years ago. At least 1,500 years before the first contact with whites, the natives established permanent villages along streams. Even so, no evidence has been found to suggest that any of the native peoples, such as the Takelma who lived along the Rogue and Applegate rivers in the 19th century, used the cave. Largely bypassed by the early non- native explorers, fur traders, and settlers because of its remote location, the region attracted newcomers in quantity when prospectors found gold near Jacksonville in the Rogue River valley in 1851. This led to the creation of Jackson County in 1852 and, after gold discoveries near Waldo in the Illinois River valley, the creation of Josephine County, named for the daughter of a gold miner. Even with an influx of miners and of settlers who farmed donation land claims, Josephine County's population was only 1,204 in 1870. Thomas Condon, a University of Oregon geology professor who visited the cave with his students in 1884 Elijah Jones Davidson, who discovered the cave in 1874, had emigrated from Illinois to Oregon with his parents, who eventually settled along Williams Creek in Josephine County. Williams, as the community came to be called, is about northeast of the cave. Only a few people visited the cave during the next decade. Among them was Thomas Condon, professor of geology at the University of Oregon. Guided by Davidson's brother, in 1884 he and a group of students hiked from Williams to the cavern, which they inspected by candlelight. Shortly thereafter, Walter Burch, an acquaintance of the Davidson family, tried to develop the cave as a business. Burch and his partners opened what they called Limestone Caves and charged visitors $1 each for a guided cave trip, a camping spot, pasture for horses, and cave water they described as medicinal. Although Burch and others hacked crude trails to the cave from Cave Junction and Williams, the trip was too difficult for most tourists, and Limestone Caves ceased operations in 1888. In the early 1890s, the Oregon Caves Improvement Company, headed by Alfonso B. Smith of San Diego and two men from Kerby, Oregon, tried to raise capital for a larger tourist business at Oregon Caves. Smith made outlandish claims about the cave and its business potential, saying that it was long, that an ordinary horse and buggy could be driven through of it, that it had 600 separate chambers, and that the company planned to build something like a streetcar line from Williams to the cave. Smith succeeded in wooing The San Francisco Examiner, which twice sent reporters to the site. On the second visit, there was \\"an orgy of destruction\\" in which passages were widened, formations broken or deliberately removed, and directional arrows added to the cave walls. After Smith had spent all of the company's money and borrowed more in its name, he disappeared in 1894, and the business collapsed. Neither Burch nor Smith had owned the cave or the land around it, which belonged to the public. Beginning in the 1890s, the Federal government began regulating the use of public lands like these. In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt designated millions of acres of forest lands for protection, including what became Siskiyou National Forest, which surrounds the cave. The USFS was created in 1905 to manage these reserves. Three years later, Congress passed the Antiquities Act, which allowed the President to designate protected areas called National Monuments on public lands. In 1909, President William Howard Taft established Oregon Caves National Monument, to be managed by the USFS.Documents, Oregon Historical Quarterly, Vol. 20 (1919). A year later the USFS employed men to guard the cave and to serve as tour guides. Isolated and difficult to reach, the monument initially attracted few visitors, by 1920 only 1,800 for the year. The situation changed markedly when large numbers of Americans began to travel by automobile on roads paid for largely with government funds. One highway connected Grants Pass with the California coast at Crescent City. Another new road, the Oregon Caves Highway, led from the Grants Pass ‚Äì Crescent City highway to the cave. Campaigns to attract car-driving tourists included those of the Cavemen, a booster group from Grants Pass that dressed in animal skins, posed along tour routes, and staged annual events to promote the monument. By 1928, the number of visitors to the cave had risen to about 24,000 a year. alt=A rustic multi-story hotel sheathed in tree bark rests in a forest behind a reflecting pool. The visitors' need for overnight lodging led to creation of public and private campsites and rustic cabins along highways near Cave Junction and the monument. In 1923, the USFS signed a contract with the Oregon Caves Company, based in Grants Pass, to run the cave tours and improve the park accommodations. Public-private partnerships between the USFS or NPS and concessionaires continued in various forms at Oregon Caves into the 21st century. The Chalet, a building with a kitchen, dining room, gift shop, ticket sales area, and a dormitory for women on the Oregon Caves Company staff, was completed later that year. Three years later, the company added seven two- bedroom cabins for tourists and a dormitory for male employees. In 1928, an Oregon Caves bill written by the USFS and introduced by Senator Charles McNary of Oregon won Congressional approval. It provided funds for electric lights, a power plant, a system of pipes and hoses to wash mud from the cave, and an artificial exit tunnel to eliminate the crowding that occurred when two groups on round-trip tours had to pass one another. The tunnel was completed in 1931. Management of the monument was transferred from the Forest Service to the NPS in 1933, and a six-story hotel, the Oregon Caves Chateau, was completed at the site in 1934. Gust Lium, a builder from Grants Pass, oversaw construction of the Chateau and some of the park's other buildings, which he designed in a rustic style. Mason Manufacturing of Los Angeles produced the Chateau's furniture in a style called Monterey, valued in the 21st century at up to $5,000 for a single chair. During the 1930s and early 1940s, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) installed water and telephone lines, improved trails, and worked on landscaping at the park. The Chalet was rebuilt in 1942 to include a third story and a larger dormitory for women. Although the Chateau suffered $100,000 in damage from a 1964 flood, it was repaired. By 1968, a total of one million people had visited the cave. In 1987, the Chateau was declared a National Historic Landmark, and in 1992, of the monument, including the Chateau and other rustic structures, were listed as the Oregon Caves Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2001, the NPS began running the cave tours formerly offered by private contractors, and two years later all the structures at the monument became public property managed by the NPS. The Illinois Valley Community Development Organization (IVCDO), a non-profit organization based in Cave Junction, runs the monument's gift shop. In 2014, the protected area was expanded by that was transferred from the Rogue River ‚Äì Siskiyou National Forest to create the National Monument and Preserve. The preserve consists of forest, subalpine meadows, mountains, and creeks formerly managed by the USFS and now by the NPS. Named features within the addition include Mount Elijah (), Bigelow Lake, and a network of existing trails linked to the monument trails. Although hunting is allowed in the preserve but not in the monument, the new arrangement seeks to end cattle grazing in the Cave Creek ‚Äì River Styx watershed. Geology and paleontology alt=Stalactites, stalagmites, and a column of dripstone in a large cave chamber called Miller's Chapel Most caves created from dissolved rocks are formed in limestone or dolomite, but Oregon Caves was formed in marble. Of the more than 3,900 cave systems managed by the NPS, only those in Oregon Caves National Monument and Preserve, Kings Canyon National Park, and Great Basin National Park have marble caves. The parent rock in which the cave developed was formed about 190 million years ago as limestone that was part of a tectonic plate beneath the Pacific Ocean. Granitic plutons intruded this part of the ocean crust, the Applegate terrane, about 160 million years ago. As the oceanic crust carrying the terrane subducted under the North American plate, the terrane accreted onto the North American Plate and the limestone was subjected to heat and pressure that metamorphosed it to marble. Further tectonic movements eventually lifted the marble to about above sea level. The marble block containing the cave is at least long, wide, and about high. The cave's creation took place long after the marble formed. As groundwater seeped into cracks in the marble, it eventually dissolved enough rock to expand some of the cracks to the size of tunnels. Generally, the age of a cave cannot be determined directly because the cave itself is an empty space, but scientists can sometimes determine the age of speleothems or sediments in a cave. An early 21st-century study of speleothem development in Oregon Caves focused on the past 380,000 years. Based on the available evidence, the cave is thought to be at least a million years old and \\"probably not much older than a few million\\" years. alt=A cluster of needle-shaped rock crystals on a cave wall Marble has a more coarse-grained texture than limestone, but both are made of calcite (). Caves often develop when slightly acidic groundwater dissolves calcite along natural fractures in the rock. A reversal of the dissolving process can create flowstone and dripstone such as stalactites, which hang from cave ceilings like icicles, and stalagmites, cone-shaped masses that form on cave floors, usually directly below stalactites. These structures form when acidic groundwater with a high concentration of dissolved calcite drips slowly from the ceiling of an air-filled cave, becomes less acidic, and leaves some of its calcite behind as a solid precipitate. Oregon Caves includes a variety of cave formations created through precipitation of calcite. Although many of the speleothems in the public sections of the cave have been broken, discolored by human skin oils, or otherwise damaged, the narrow twisting passages of the \\"show cave\\" have been largely preserved. The cave is not pure marble. Streams have deposited silts and gravels from the surface. Dikes of diorite, an igneous rock that was part of a pluton, and shales and sandstones, sedimentary rocks interbedded with the marble, are part of the cave. The monument has more than 50 paleontological sites ranging in age from Late Pleistocene to Holocene. A fossil of a grizzly bear more than 50,000 years old and a jaguar fossil between 40,000 and 20,000 years old have been found in the cave. Other fossils include amphibians, and rare finds of the mountain beaver and the blue grouse. The monument's mammalian fossils, found in non-public sections of the cave, are of national significance. Climate The monument is in the mountains at elevations varying from above sea level. The park's nearness to the ocean contributes to its relatively mild climate. Temperatures generally range between in winter and in summer. Inside the cave the temperature is always about . Annual precipitation, arriving mostly as wet snow, averages . Moderate winds are common. Flora and fauna Cave cricket in Oregon Cavesalt=A dark brown humpbacked \\"bug\\" with large hind legs, long forelegs, and long antennae Located within the Klamath‚ÄìSiskiyou region, known for its high biodiversity, the monument supports 391 vascular plant species as well as many species of bryophyte, lichen, and macrofungi. Trees in the monument include Douglas fir, oak, white fir, and alder. Among the oldest trees is Big Tree, thought to be the widest Douglas fir in the state. It is in circumference near the base. Its age is estimated at 600 to 800 years, and it was described in the 1930s as in diameter. The monument contains no plants with special conservation status. Species lists for the park include about 50 mammals, 86 birds, 11 reptiles and amphibians, 8 bats, more than 200 arthropods, 8 snails and slugs, 75 butterflies, more than 55 moths, and 8 aquatic macroinvertebrates. Of these species, 160 are found inside the cave. Outside the cave, the black-tailed deer, Steller's jay, the common raven, and Townsend's chipmunk are among animals often seen in the park. Less commonly sighted are the black bear, cougar, northern flying squirrel, and Pacific giant salamander. Springs and other wet places support flatworms, frogs, and snails. Animal species in the park with special conservation status are the northern spotted owl, California mountain kingsnake, tailed frog, Del Norte salamander, northern goshawk, olive-sided flycatcher, little willow flycatcher, Siskiyou gazelle beetle, and Pacific fisher. Five at-risk bat species are found in the cave: Townsend's big-eared bat, and the long-eared, fringed, long-legged, and Yuma myotis. Recreation and lodging alt=A lighted walkway with a two-tiered handrail passes through a cave passage shaped like a tunnel. Oregon Caves National Monument and Preserve is open year-round, although snow sometimes blocks the road to the park, and the visitor center is open when the cave is open for tours. Cave tours are usually offered from mid-April to early November, but the schedule depends in spring and fall on weather conditions. The Illinois Valley Visitor Center in Cave Junction, managed by the IVCDO under an NPS contract, also has information about the cave. Cave-tour tickets are available online through the Recreation.gov website, and a limited number of tour tickets may sometimes be had first-come, first-served. Tours vary in length and duration. The basic ranger-guided \\"discovery cave tour\\", 90 minutes long, requires negotiating more than 500 steep and uneven stairs and passageways with as little as between floor and ceiling. Not recommended by the NPS for anyone with heart, lung, or mobility problems, the tour involves a total climb of . Children under tall or who are unable to climb a set of test stairs on their own are not allowed on the full cave tour. The NPS offers a limited number of off- trail \\"introduction to caving\\" tours by reservation only. Since the cave is only inside regardless of the outdoor temperature, the NPS recommends warm clothing for its tours. Good walking shoes are needed to negotiate slippery and uneven surfaces. Not allowed on the tours are flashlights, backpacks, large purses, tripods, or pets. To protect bats from white nose syndrome, visitors must not take any clothing or equipment into Oregon Caves that have previously entered any other cave or mine. alt=Map of trails in and near the monument. Symbols show the locations of the parking lot, the hotel, the visitor center, and Big Tree. Lodging is available in the monument at the Chateau, which has 23 rooms to rent. Several hiking trails wind through the monument and adjacent forest lands. Big Tree Trail, long, gains in elevation between the visitor center and Big Tree. No Name Trail, long, begins behind the visitor center, follows Cave Creek, crosses it, and then climbs steeply to the west side of the monument. Two short side trails lead from the main trail to waterfalls along No Name Creek. Cliff Nature Trail, passing over marble outcrops and through fir forests, winds for about from near the cave entrance past the cave exit to Big Tree Trail. Old Growth Trail, long, links the Chateau and visitor center to the main parking lot. Other named trails entering the park include Cave Creek, Mt. Elijah, and Limestone. In 2012, the Oregon Caves Historic District was expanded to include several segments of the trail system. Hotels, bed and breakfasts, motels, and resorts in the vicinity offer a variety of accommodations. Although no camping is allowed in the monument, the NPS maintains the Cave Creek Campground within the preserve. Additionally, the USFS maintains a campground nearby, and there are private campgrounds and recreational vehicle parks in the vicinity. The Chateau, generally open from early May to late October, has a restaurant, coffee shop, and delicatessen, and Cave Junction has several restaurants. The monument grounds include several picnic tables.

Located at the base of the Coromandel Peninsula, it is close to the junction of the Waihou and Ohinemuri Rivers, it is 20 kilometres (12.4 miles) from the Firth of Thames coast. New Zealanders know Paeroa for its mineral springs, which used to provide the water used in a local soft drink, \\"Lemon & Paeroa\\". The town stands at the intersection of State Highways 2 and 26, and is the central service location for the Hauraki District with the town being a midway stop between Auckland, Tauranga and Rotorua. It is about half way between Auckland and Tauranga, and acts as the southern gateway to the Coromandel Peninsula, and as the western gateway to the Bay of Plenty and the Karangahake Gorge.  Etymology  One can gloss the MƒÅori-language name Paeroa as composed of pae (ridge) and roa (long). Demographics Paeroa had a population of 4,269 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 471 people (12.4%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 378 people (9.7%) since the 2006 census.

The proportion of people born overseas was 12.3%, compared with 27.1% nationally. Although some people objected to giving their religion, 49.4% had no religion, 36.3% were Christian, 0.4% were Hindu, 0.1% were Muslim, 0.6% were Buddhist and 4.6% had other religions. Of those at least 15 years old, 300 (8.5%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 1,125 (31.7%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $22,200. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 1,251 (35.3%) people were employed full-time, 450 (12.7%) were part-time, and 186 (5.2%) were unemployed. Rural surrounds The statistical area of Paeroa Rural covers 273 square kilometres and includes the localities of Netherton, Tirohia and Karangahake.

History Early settlement Captain James Cook explored the Waihou River in 1779, taking a long-boat up as far as Netherton, just a couple of miles from where the town of Paeroa was built 100 years on. The area was briefly explored in October 1826 by Captain James Herd, in command of the Lambton and the Isabella (or Rosanna). Herd was sent on an exploratory mission by the first organisation to be known as the New Zealand Company and claimed to have bought of land from local MƒÅori in Hokianga and Manukau. By 1869, anticipating the rush to the Ohinemuri Goldfields, considerable numbers of miners camped at Cashell‚Äôs Landing \\"Puke\\". Development of Paeroa township In 1870, Asher Cassrels, a Lithuanian, leased the block of land known as Paeroa from MƒÅori. This included Primrose Hill and most of what is now the town centre. When James Mackay (surveyor) and Sir David McLean (Minister of Mines) completed negotiations six years later with the MƒÅori Chiefs, Tukukino and Taraia, the fields were declared open. Six hundred miners rushed to Karangahake, considered to be the El Dorado, on 3 March 1875. A canvas town of 1,600 people with about 20 stores and grog shops set the area going. The big gold reefs like Talisman and Crown were discovered but proved hard to work. Heavy machinery required for hard quartz mining had to be brought via the Waihou River and up to Paeroa. The river was the only highway and with two shipping companies in operation, Paeroa became a thriving transport and distribution centre. When the Northern Steamship Company combined with its opposition, the wharves from near the Bank of New Zealand (Wharf Street) had to be shifted downstream in 1892, and eventually to just below Puke Bridge due to the silting from mining operations. A busy freight business developed with four ships regularly running from Auckland to Thames to Paeroa. The Thames Branch railway line reached the town in 1881 at the Paeroa Railway Station, and gradually ships gave way to steam, which in turn gave way to road transport. Work on the Paeroa‚ÄìPokeno Line commenced in the 1930s, but little was done and the proposal was abandoned. A historic Paeroa building, in the town centre, is the former National Bank of New Zealand's gold refinery, built in 1914 in Willoughby Street. The building is now a private home and business, hidden from street level view by a ponga fence. In 1911 the National Bank formed joint venture with the New Zealand Mining Trust and the bank purchased a section with a frontage by deep in Arthur Street (now Willoughby Street) for 200 pounds. By February, 1914, a Ferro-cement building , with an iron roof and a smokestack was completed. Inside was the main refining chamber, two assay offices, weighing room, accounting room, engine and dynamo rooms, two officers' bedrooms, sitting room and bathroom. Detached from the main building was a store room and coal bin. Modern history As late as 1928, the Waihou River was still navigable for larger ships all the way up to the town, and the Kopu Bridge was therefore constructed as a swing bridge. When Brenan and Company, the largest horse and wagon operator, moved to trucking, they bought out the steamship company and named their trucks after the ships that plied the Ohinemuri River. Waimarie and Taniwha were always painted on the new International or Ford trucks that came into their fleet. When transport operator Sarjant‚Äôs amalgamated with Brenan, a large truck centre evolved in Paeroa. As the passenger rail service dwindled, Paeroa eventually lost its railway, so much of the town had its beginnings in supply and transport to the Hauraki and District. The swings of time have enabled the town to boom and revert a number of times. Culture  Lemon & Paeroa  The Giant L&P; bottle in Paeroa Paeroa is best known for the soft drink Lemon & Paeroa (L&P;) that used to be produced in the town. The soft drink was made with lemon and carbonated mineral water from Paeroa. Today L&P; is owned by Coca-Cola and produced on the same production line as other Coca-Cola products sold in New Zealand. A large L&P; bottle stands on the main road as a landmark in the town of Paeroa. In 1994 L&P; ran a series of advertisements based around Paeroa, the advert had locals standing in front of various parts of the town pointing out what the town isn't famous for. In one advertisement, a local stands in front a 1930s bungalow making the comment, \\"It's not famous for its Hollywood mansions\\". Landmarks and features in the town included the towns Harbour Bridge (a small single lane bridge), bright lights (a flashing chemist sign), luxury hotels (a local motel), trendy shops (an Op Shop) and Opera House (the back of the local town hall). At the end of each advert a group of people would end by saying \\"But it is famous\\" pointing to the landmark L&P; bottle in the background. The advert would end with the tag line L&P; World Famous in New Zealand. There were 3 separate advertisements all using the song Counting the Beat by The Swingers. Events Paeroa is known as the Events Capital of the Coromandel, as well as having a national reputation for horse racing. February is a busy event month in Paeroa and the motorcycle race ‚ÄòBattle of the Streets‚Äô and ‚ÄòPipe Band Tattoo‚Äô events both attract participants and crowds from all over New Zealand and overseas. The horse track was closed in 2014 due to financial issues with the managers of the track..

Originally and most recently portrayed by Shemar Moore, Darius McCrary took over between December 29, 2009, and October 17, 2011. Moore reprised the role for a guest appearance in September 2014 and April 2019. Malcolm is the half-brother of longtime character, Neil Winters (Kristoff St. John). His history includes getting Neil's wife, Drucilla Winters, pregnant, his history as a photographer, and marriages to Olivia Winters and Sofia Dupre. In March 2019, it was announced that Moore would reprise the role of Malcolm Winters for a two-episode stint, following St. John's passing the month before. Casting The role was originated by Shemar Moore on May 5, 1994, who received a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his portrayal in 2000, with nominations for Outstanding Younger Actor in 1996 and 1997. After much speculation that Moore would exit the soap opera in 2000, he confirmed that he would depart at the end of his contract in the spring of 2001. However, in February 2001, Moore announced that he had extended his contract through the end of that year. In December, he announced he was leaving The Young and the Restless, and last aired on February 14, 2002. In September 2004, after a two-year absence, Moore was announced to reprise the role. Of Moore's return, former co-head writer John F. Smith stated: \\"We are thrilled to have Shemar back with us. His story will be something very unexpected, off the page, and exciting. The man is going to have impact.\\" Moore made his return on November 1, 2004. However, within weeks, Moore's publicist revealed that his return would be short-lived, as he had only signed a six-month contract. The publicist stated: \\"He's auditioning now [for other projects] and he has two or three films coming out next year. You know how this industry is. At least [The Young and the Restless will] have him for six months.\\" Moore made his final appearance as the character on September 1, 2005. In September 2009, it was announced that the soap opera had put out a casting call for the role of Malcolm. In November, Darius McCrary was announced to be joining the cast, in his first daytime television role, with his first appearance on December 29, 2009. In September 2011, it was announced that McCrary had been let go from The Young and the Restless. He made his final appearance on October 17, 2011. On July 23, 2014, CBS Daytime announced that Moore would reprise the role of Malcolm for a two- episode guest stint starting on September 10, 2014. In March 2019, it was announced that Moore would return for another two-episode guest stint, following the death of Kristoff St. John. Storylines 1994‚Äì2002, 2004‚Äì05 Malcolm first arrives in Genoa City in 1994, determined to rebuild his relationship with his estranged half-brother, Neil Winters. Neil, at first, wants nothing to do with his rebellious younger half-brother, but eventually decides to give him a second chance. With the help of Blade Bladeson, Malcolm became Genoa City's most prominent photographer. He develops a friendship with Neil's wife Drucilla Barber, and is instantly smitten with her, but nothing becomes of it. However, Malcolm later discovers Drucilla after she has taken a good dose of cold medication, and thus mistakes Malcolm for Neil. After Drucilla calls out for Neil, making Malcolm realize her advances were not intended for him, Malcolm chooses to rape her. The following morning, Malcolm realizes what a mistake he has made and confides his crime to Dru's sister, Olivia. Nine months later, Drucilla gives birth to a daughter, Lily Winters. Having convinced herself that Neil is Lily's father, Dru forgives Malcolm and Olivia soon fixes him up with her hospital colleague, Keesha Monroe. They fall in love and marry, just before Keesha dies of AIDS. Malcolm then develops a relationship with recently widowed Olivia and grows very attached to her son Nathan Hastings, Jr. Malcolm and Olivia marry in 1997. One year later, Malcolm's ex-girlfriend Callie Rogers arrives in town and Olivia becomes jealous that Malcolm is spending so much time with her. Olivia's insecurity ultimately destroys her marriage to Malcolm and he rebounds back to Callie. The two become engaged but Callie soon breaks it off and leaves town. In the meantime, Malcolm continues his close relationship with his former stepson Nate, who views Malcolm as his father. Malcolm and Neil soon find themselves fighting over a woman, attorney Alex Perez. Malcolm and Alex fall in love and become engaged, though she is also developing feelings for Neil. While the three of them are on business in Kenya, Malcolm catches them together and leaves. While driving over a bridge, on the way to a photo shoot, the bridge collapses and Malcolm is presumed dead. Malcolm returns to town two years later resenting Neil, believing he did not do enough to rescue him in Kenya. Eventually the two bury the hatchet. While in town, Malcolm briefly has a fling with Adrienne Markham, Damon Porter's ex-wife. Malcolm then demands that Dru take a paternity test to determine once and for all if he is Lily's biological father. When Malcolm is proven to be Lily's father, he and Dru decide to keep it a secret and he leaves town. While Malcolm is gone, Lily and Neil discover the truth about her paternity, but are unable to contact him. 2009‚Äì11 Four years later, Malcolm returned to Genoa City while secretly working undercover as a corporate spy for Tucker McCall. He learns that Lily had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer and attempted to support her while clashing with Neil. However, the two eventually put aside their differences and reconnected as brothers. Malcolm took a job as a photographer at Restless Style magazine and hired his adopted nephew, Devon Hamilton, as his assistant. Months after Malcolm mentioned he was engaged, his fianc√©e, Sofia Dupre, arrived in town. She worked for Tucker and had a business clash with Neil, and they ended up having an affair and not telling Malcolm to act like it never happened. Malcolm and Sofia were married soon after. Sofia is later found out to be pregnant, though the paternity of the baby was left undetermined. While pregnant, Sofia was forced to tell Malcolm the truth about her affair with Neil, and that she wasn't sure of the paternity of the baby. Sofia gave birth to a boy named Moses Winters, after her father. Afterward, a paternity test showed that Neil is Moses's father. Devastated, Malcolm had to make a decision about his future with Moses, and visited Sofia in the hospital and asked her to sign divorce papers and tells her that he will be moving away, even though Sofia wanted to work out their marriage. Malcolm said goodbye to Genoa City and headed for the airport. 2014 In September 2014, Malcolm returned to Genoa City, planning to overcome his differences with Neil, and help him cope with his sudden blindness. The two re-establish their relationship as brothers and Malcolm heads off to his next photo shoot. 2019 After Neil's sudden death, Malcolm returns to Genoa City to be with the family. At Neil's funeral, Malcolm gives a tearful and emotional eulogy stating that while his relationship with his brother wasn't always perfect, he always had an unconditional love and admiration for him. He thanks Neil for all he's done for him and given him. After comforting everyone at the house, Malcolm heads back on the road, promising to stay in touch.

The fourth episode of the show overall, it was first broadcast on October 13, 1994. The episode was directed by James Burrows and written by Alexa Junge. This episode is the first of many that splits the gang into two separate stories based on gender. The guys go to a hockey game, where Ross (David Schwimmer) gets hit in the face with a hockey puck. The rest of the evening is spent in the ER, where a surly receptionist gets her nose broken when the puck goes flying. Meanwhile, the girls, sparked by celebrations over Rachel's first paycheck, spy on George Stephanopoulos, then President Clinton's top aide, which culminates in them seeing Stephanopoulos nude.  Plot  When Phoebe cannot get any sleep because her grandmother is having loud sex with her boyfriend, Monica invites her to sleep over at her apartment with her and Rachel. Chandler and Joey go to the coffee house to invite Ross to a hockey game as a \\"late birthday present\\" . Ross is reluctant after becoming depressed about the day being the anniversary of him and ex-wife Carol sleeping together for the first time. He eventually accepts after Joey is able to convince him after promising him a foam finger. At the hockey game, Ross continues to reminisce on Carol, which makes him depressed once again, and annoys Chandler and Joey. He becomes happy again when the game starts but is soon hit in the face with the hockey puck and are forced to head to the hospital where they deal with a snippy receptionist, Nurse Sizemore (Mary Pat Gleason). While waiting around, Ross admits to Chandler and Joey that the memory is important to him as it was the day he lost his virginity. After Ross is fit in a nose cast, he encounters a bratty boy (Benjamin Caya) who \\"found\\" the hockey puck that hit Ross and claims it as his own. Ross asks for it back and the kid refuses. After a short brawl over the puck, it flies out of the boy's grasp and it hits the receptionist in the face, which Ross admits was fun. Meanwhile, Rachel receives her first paycheck. She is very excited at first only to discover she will not have much after taxes. She also gets reunited with her old friends, Leslie (Leesa Bryte), Kiki (Michele Maika), and Joanne (Marianne Hagan). While they boast about their career and family achievements, she feels increasingly depressed because of her low income. Back at the apartment, while the girls are getting ready for their slumber party, Rachel gets a call from her credit card company and complains about her low income. Monica and Phoebe try to cheer her up with no effect as it actually makes them depressed too. A pizza delivery guy (Sean Whalen) arrives, although he brings them the wrong pizza; the one he brought was meant for \\"G. Stephanopoulos\\". The girls pay for the pizza and head to the balcony with binoculars to spy on George. As they spy on him, they get drunk and start telling each other secrets. This ends up in a brawl between Monica and Rachel, with Phoebe stopping them once she spots George. They beg him to take his towel off, which he does. During the credits, Joey and the girls are playing twister. Rachel gets another call from her credit card company; Chandler takes her place in the game. When asked why she has not been using her card, she says she is doing fine, confident in her independence. Reception Joe Reid and Sonia Saraiya of The A.V. Club both commented on the episode, Saraiya said; \\"\\"The One With George Stephanopoulos\\" uses a tried-and-true sitcom convention‚Äîit splits the cast on gender lines and sends them off to different adventures, allowing them to \\"bro out\\" or have \\"girl talk\\" as need be. Chandler, Joey, and Ross have a hockey adventure, which is punctuated by Ross' reminisces of his \\"first time\\" with Carol and ends up, obviously, in the emergency room; meanwhile, the girls, led by Rachel, worry about their life plans and also get drunk and also spy on George Stephanopoulos, who is soooo dreamy. Of the two stories, the latter has real staying power‚Äîthe conversation feels like it could have been written today, or to be more exact, it feels like it was transcribed verbatim from the conversation that occurred on my couch last night.\\" Reid said; \\"In \\"The One With George Stephanopoulos,\\" Rachel is very much questioning her decision, and after spending an afternoon with her squealing Fifth Avenue friends, she's really having second thoughts. Of course, there isn't an existential crisis on Earth that couldn't have been solved by the chance to gawk at George Stephanopoulos from across an alleyway. At least in 1994. I was genuinely shocked to remember that there was a time that Stephanopoulos was a sex symbol. What desperate, pre-Clooney times those were!\\".

Located 36 kilometres to the south of Auckland CBD, under authority of the Auckland Council. Drury lies at the southern border of the Auckland metropolitan area, 12 kilometres to the northeast of Pukekohe, close to the Papakura Channel, an arm of the Manukau Harbour. Name Drury is named after Commander Byron Drury, captain of HMS Pandora, who surveyed the Manukau Harbour in 1853.Drury from nzhistory.govt.nz History Drury Pottery & Fireclay Works in 1906 Coal mining was a significant early industry established in Drury during the 1850s, and saw the formation of the Waihoihoi Mining and Coal Company in 1859. Continued success with coal mining led to the opening of one of New Zealand's earliest tramways by the company in 1862, consisting of 4ft 8in gauge track with a length of 5.2km, whereby coal was transported to Slippery Creek for shipment to Onehunga. Another early industry seen in Drury was that of an extensive brick and pottery works, linked to a nearby quarry by a tram line at the foot of the Drury Hills. The brick and pottery industry in Drury appears to have operated until at least 1928. Drury was a significant staging area for British soldiers during the New Zealand Wars, who established a camp in the village under the command of General Duncan Cameron. These soldiers also helped to construct an extension to the Great South Road south to the Mangatawhiri Stream. During the major reform of local government in 1989, Drury was included in the Auckland Region and made up the southern edge of the Papakura District, along with a certain extent of the eastern surrounding rural areas, previously known as Franklin County. Drury was until recently a relatively small semi-rural area nestling at the foot of the low-lying Bombay Hills. Urban spread of Auckland has rendered it an extreme southern suburb, close to the junction between State Highways 1 and 22, both of which head south towards the Waikato region. After a review of the Royal Commission on Auckland Governance, the entire Auckland Region was amalgamated into a single city authority, the Auckland Council, in 2010. The Papakura District and Franklin District, and all other territorial authorities in the region were abolished and incorporated into the new council. The town of Drury was included in the Franklin ward, one of the thirteen wards of the council.

She was previously played by actress Marcy Walker from 1981‚Äì1984, and then again from 1995‚Äì2005, although the role was also briefly portrayed by Alice Haining from September 1984 to 1985. Liza is a resident of the fictional town of Pine Valley, Pennsylvania. Character history Liza made her first appearance in 1981 as a snobbish upper-class teenager from one of Pine Valley's wealthiest families, with a crush on upper-class classmate Greg Nelson. However, Greg's heart belonged to Jenny Gardner, a warm-hearted working-class girl. Liza engaged in numerous schemes to steal Greg from Jenny. Her two most heinous acts as a teenager occurred at about the same time. Liza blackmailed Jenny, threatening to reveal to Greg that Jenny's father, Ray Gardner was a convict who had raped Ruth Martin years earlier. After Jenny's best friend Jesse Hubbard confronted her, Liza falsely accused him of attempted rape, subtly using old stereotypes about black men and White women as a means of making her story seem credible. With Jenny humiliated and Jesse eager to avoid arrest, the two fled to the Hell's Kitchen section of New York City, where they remained for weeks until Liza's accusations against Jesse were discredited. After Liza failed in her schemes to win Greg and she realized that he would never love her (He was already turned off by her narcissistic and snobby personality from the get go.), she started a relationship with Ruth's adopted son Tad Martin (Jenny's biological brother). However, Liza was crushed when she discovered Tad was also having an affair with her mother, Marian Chandler. Later, partly as a result of her \\"easy\\" reputation, Liza was raped. Initially, no one believed her due to her past history as a lying blackmailer except Dr. Cliff Warner. However, she mistook his compassion for romantic interest and attempted to steal him from his wife Nina. Liza left town a few months later to give herself a fresh start in a new city. Liza made a triumphant return to Pine Valley in September 1995. Now a strong career woman, Liza got revenge on Tad by seducing him into bed, breaking up his marriage to Dixie Cooney. Liza then moved on to Jake Martin, Tad's adopted brother. Liza then found herself in a strange predicament when she got pregnant with what she thought was Jake's baby. It turned out to be Adam Chandler's child, for he had switched Jake's sperm at the sperm bank with his. In May 1999, Liza gave birth to her daughter, Colby Marian Chandler, and eventually fell for Adam and married him. However, Adam's controlling nature and penchant for lying led to their divorce, remarrying and divorce. Liza got the shock of her life in 2001, when Mia Saunders revealed herself to be her half-sister. Eventually, Liza and Mia formed a sisterly bond and Liza even financed the money to upstart Fusion, the new cosmetics company that Mia co- founded in late 2002 with Greenlee Smythe, Kendall Hart, and Simone Torres. In late 2004, Liza, with Tad's help, went on the run with Colby in tow. Her last appearance was in early 2005. However, Colby eventually returned (rapidly aged to her teenaged years) to Pine Valley to live with Adam. Initially, she has exhibited all of Liza's worst character traits from the '80s, including consistent spoiled behavior, and a false statutory rape allegation against Erica Kane's son Josh Madden. However, Colby has put most of such behavior behind her, and has recently emerged as a more sympathetic character. Liza, now being played by Jamie Luner, returned to Pine Valley in April 2009. She has \\"reinvented herself\\" as an attorney and comes back to reclaim daughter Colby. She has made a deal with Jake Martin to adopt Amanda Dillon's son as her own, naming him Stuart after her late step-father. Strangely enough, Liza's history as the financial founder of Fusion or any of her other ties to the company have not been mentioned since Jamie Luner assumed the role. During the week of Stuart's murder mystery (May 2009), it is revealed that Liza is six months pregnant. Liza admits to Zach Slater that she is not pregnant, but that she is expecting a child through a surrogate. She does not want anyone to know that she is not really pregnant, and asks Zach to keep her secret. While talking to Amanda and she seems she plans on adopting Amanda's baby boy and not tell anyone about it with the help of Jake Martin. Jake plans to help Liza, because she wants to adopt Amanda's baby boy and not tell anyone about it. In the week of June 29, Jake helped Liza \\"pretend\\" to give birth to a healthy baby boy with the help of Tad Martin. The viewers think that Liza has the baby. Then they find out that Jake didn't really give Liza Amanda's baby. Liza names her son after her step-father. He gives her a baby which is put for adoption. Placing Amanda's baby to be given to a family in the country. Until Taylor takes care of him, under the alias Tracy. Her daughter Colby found out from eavesdropping that Jake Martin was supposed to be her father, but Adam switched the sperm with his. After Trevor went missing, Jake and Amanda can not go to the police because faking the baby's death. Tad followed David and reveal to Liza that she is not raising Amanda's son. Tad and Liza hitched a plan to follow David, and Liza forms a relationship with him. David thinks that Liza's son is his. David learns the truth about the baby being alive. He became extremely furious that this secret was kept from him. He held Liza to gunpoint because he wanted to know where his baby was. While Liza bonds her \\"son\\", the birth mother comes to Pine Valley in search of her baby. Liza initially lies to Bailey and tells her that the baby is better off in his new home. She then is persuaded by Tad to tell the truth about her child being Bailey's son. Rather than Bailey and Liza going to court in a paternity case, Liza invites Bailey to move in with her while she decides if she wants to keep her baby. Stuart's biological father tracks down Bailey in Pine Valley and offers Liza a bribe to keep her baby in exchange for money. She refuses and tells him to leave. Bailey and Damon decide to keep Stuart as their own and move out of Liza's apartment. In January 2010, Bailey contacts Liza in order to bail Damon out of jail. On July 6, Damon hugs Liza then ends up kissing her. Right after that Tad Martin, Damon's father walks in with three cans of soda. Later, on the week of November 29, 2010, David Hayward is shot and critically wounded by Erica; though he survives, he is left comatose. Liza charges Erica with attempted murder, disregarding the fact that Erica only did it to save Ryan's life. Erica subsequently confronts Liza and assures her that, unlike Greenlee, she will not go down without a fight, later becoming convinced that Liza is merely pushing the charges out of jealousy and spite. On December 17, 2010, Liza became the advocate for David Hayward (who is still in a coma). Slowly realizing that her taking Erica to court is unjustified, Liza finally drops the charges after a discussion with Tad.

The seventh episode of the show overall, it was first broadcast on November 3, 1994. In the episode, there's a blackout in the city, and Chandler gets stuck in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre and Ross attempts to tell Rachel his feelings for her. This episode coined the term \\"friend zone\\". Plot The episode begins with a blackout. Monica, Rachel, Ross, and Joey are watching Phoebe begin an acoustic set at Central Perk. Chandler gets trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre, a Victoria's Secret model. He tries to impress her in various ways that fail. He smiles so much it creeps her out. When she offers him some chewing gum, he pronounces oddly that \\"gum would be perfection.\\" He tries to blow a bubble with the gum only to spit it out accidentally. He then tries to chew the gum again, only to realize it is someone else's gum and then proceeds to choke on it from the shock. Jill gives him the Heimlich maneuver and saves his life. Back at Monica's apartment, the rest of the friends have a discussion on the \\"weirdest place they've ever done it\\" and Rachel confesses that hers was \\"the foot of the bed\\". This leads to a conversation between her and Ross about how she wishes she had more excitement in her love life. Ross transposes his infatuation for her by predicting that her wish will come true in the future. Joey convinces Ross that he needs to tell Rachel how he feels about her before Ross enters the \\"friend zone\\". Ross works up the courage to speak to Rachel but before he can confess his feelings, a stray cat attacks him. Rachel and Phoebe search for the owner in the building. The owner turns out to be new Italian neighbor Paolo, whose sudden appearance is disconcerting to Ross. The last candle in the apartment goes out and everyone tries to make the scariest noise possible. During Ross's turn, the lights come back on and everyone sees Rachel and Paolo kissing. Chandler and Jill finally end up bonding, playing a game Jill invented that involves whipping pens around their heads. When the lights come back on, she kisses him on the cheek. A desperate Chandler then turns to the security camera in the corner and asks for a copy of the tape. Reception Purple Clover called the episode one of the 20 funniest episodes of Friends. The A.V.

It is the tenth episode of the show's first season and was broadcast on December 15, 1994. This episode marks the first appearance of Marcel, a monkey that Ross (David Schwimmer) adopts to keep him company. Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) meets scientist David, though their relationship is short-lived, when David gets a grant to work in Minsk. The gang all make a no-date pact for their New Year's Eve party, though they all end up breaking it, with undesired consequences. Plot In order to curb his loneliness after his divorce, Ross adopts a capuchin monkey named Marcel. Things start off on rocky footing ‚Äì Marcel seems rebellious and unwilling to listen to Ross. However, Chandler bonds with him almost immediately. With New Year's fast approaching, Chandler proposes that the gang make a no-date pact and have dinner together on New Year's Eve, which everyone agrees to. Phoebe sings 13 new songs she has written ‚Äì all of them about her mother's suicide. During her set, she is interrupted by two scientists arguing over her performance. She goes to confront them, and finds out that one of them ‚Äì David ‚Äì thinks that she is the most beautiful woman he has ever seen even though his partner, Max, begs to differ. Phoebe and David begin dating and she asks Chandler for permission to break the no-date pact for New Year's. He agrees as he has already asked Janice, having snapped at the thought of being alone despite how annoying she is. As the days pass, Monica plans on bringing her ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby, Rachel learns that Paolo will catch an earlier flight back to the US from Italy for New Year's, and Joey invites Sandy, a single mom he meets while working as one of Santa's elves at the mall. When Ross objects to all his friends breaking their no-date pact, Rachel suggests turning their New Year's dinner into a New Year's party to compensate so no one knows who is with whom. Max arrives and tells Phoebe that he and David have gotten a grant to study in Minsk for three years, and will be leaving on New Year's Day. When she goes to congratulate David, he and Max inform her that he has rejected the opportunity to go, wishing to stay in New York with her. The six friends end up keeping their no-date pact after all: Ross arrives at the party with only Marcel. Paolo has missed his flight, and Rachel gets attacked outside of the airport by a woman who thinks Rachel has stolen her cab. Max informs David that he is leaving for Minsk alone, and Phoebe convinces him to go with him, telling him he cannot stay just for her. Fun Bobby is depressed because his grandfather has just died, and makes the party even more depressing. Sandy not only brings her kids to the party, but she hooks up with Max. Chandler tries to tell Janice that he only invited her for New Year's, but she gets upset at him and storms off. At midnight, Phoebe is too sad to kiss anyone, Rachel's lip was cut in the attack so she cannot kiss anyone, and Monica does not feel like kissing anybody. Chandler demands someone kiss him anyway ‚Äì so Joey obliges.  Reception  Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B, saying the episode introduces the monkey that was \\"perhaps Friends biggest blunder ‚Äì forcing Schwimmer to do comedy opposite a simian is beneath him.\\" The episode \\"illustrates the writer' tendency to overplot\\" (such as having Rachel get into a catfight at the airport), \\"and the multiple story lines never quite jell. Still, any ep that gives Phoebe center stage gets bumped up a grade.\\" Sam Ashurst from Digital Spy ranked it #120 on their ranking of the 236 Friends episodes, and called it a \\"strong, early episode\\".

The speech launched Reagan into national prominence. Background Many versions of the speech exist, since it was altered over many weeks. Contrary to popular belief, however, the speech was not given at the 1964 Republican National Convention in San Francisco, California as a nomination speech for presidential candidate Senator Barry Goldwater; Everett Dirksen gave that nomination speech, while Richard Nixon introduced Goldwater prior to his acceptance speech. Reagan, though he campaigned for Goldwater, did not use \\"A Time for Choosing\\" until October 27, 1964, when it was part of a pre-recorded television program, Rendezvous with Destiny. (The title of the program was used by Franklin D. Roosevelt in his June 27, 1936 speech to the 1936 Democratic National Convention.) In his autobiography, An American Life, Reagan recalled going to bed that night \\"hoping I hadn't let Barry down.\\" Speaking for Goldwater, Reagan stressed his belief in the importance of smaller government. In the speech, he revealed his ideological motivation: \\"The Founding Fathers knew a government can't control the economy without controlling people. And they knew when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose. So we have come to a time for choosing.\\" He also said, \\"You and I are told we must choose between a left or right, but I suggest there is no such thing as a left or right. There is only an up or down. Up to man's age-old dream ‚Äì the maximum of individual freedom consistent with law and order ‚Äì or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism.\\"Richard A. Harris, Daniel J. Tichenor. A History of the U.S. Political System: Ideas, Interests, and Institutions, Volume 1. Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 2009. p. 384 The speech raised $1 million for Goldwater's campaign, and is considered the event that launched Reagan's political career.Cannon (2001), p. 36 Aftermath To this day, \\"The Speech\\" is considered one of the most effective ever made on behalf of a candidate. Nevertheless, Barry Goldwater lost the election by one of the largest margins in history. Soon afterwards, Reagan was asked to run for Governor of California; he ran for office and won election in 1966.

Life and work  Thom was born in Carradale in 1894 to Archibald Thom,https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-38056?rskey=UGurqo&result;=3 a tenant farmer at Mains farm for Carradale House, and his wife Lily Stevenson Strang from the family of Robert Louis Stevenson. Her mother (Thom's grandmother) belonged to a large family from Symington, upon whom had been bestowed the land by Robert the Bruce. His father trained the Church choir while his mother was pianist. Thom spent his early years at Mains farm until moving to The Hill farm at Dunlop, Ayrshire. Instilled with a good work ethic by his father, Thom taught himself industrial engineering and entered college in Glasgow in 1911 where he studied alongside John Logie Baird. In 1912 he attended summer school at Loch Eck where he was trained in surveying and field astronomy by Dr David Clark and Professor Moncur. In 1913, aged just 19, he assisted in surveying the Canadian Pacific Rail Network. Thom graduated from the Royal College of Science and Technology and the University of Glasgow in 1914, earning a BSc with special distinction in Engineering. He suffered from a heart murmur and was not drafted during the First World War. Instead he went to work in civil engineering of the Forth Bridge and later designed flying boats for the Gosport Aircraft Company. In 1917 he married Jeanie Kirkwood with whom he shared a long and lively marriage. He returned to the University of Glasgow and worked as a lecturer from 1922 to 1939, quickly earning his PhD and DSc degrees. He built his own home called Thalassa in 1922, along with a windmill to power it with electricity. His father died in 1924 and he took over running the farm where he fathered three children, Archibald, Beryl and Alan. Thom helped to develop the Department of Aeronautics at the University of Glasgow and lectured on statistics, practical field surveying, theodolite design and astronomy. From 1930 to 1935 he was a Carnegie Teaching Fellow. During the Second World War, Thom moved to Fleet in Hampshire where he was appointed Principal Scientific Officer heading the Royal Aircraft Establishment team that developed the first high speed wind tunnel. Later, he was professor and chair of engineering science at Brasenose College, University of Oxford where he became interested in the methods that prehistoric peoples used to build megalithic monuments. Thom became especially interested in the stone circles of the British Isles and FranceHutton, Ronald The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles Blackwell Publishing 1993 p. 111 and their astronomical associations. In 1955, Alexander Thom published A statistical examination of megalithic sites in Britain in which he first suggested the megalithic yard as a standardised prehistoric measurement. He retired from academia in 1961 to spend the rest of his life devoted to this area of research. The Thom Building, housing the Department of Engineering Science at Oxford, built in the 1960s, is named after Alexander Thom. From around 1933 to 1977 Thom spent most of his weekends and holiday periods hefting theodolites and survey equipment around the countryside with his family member or friends, most notably with his son Archie. From studies measuring and analysing the data created at over five hundred megalithic sites, he attempted to classify stone circles into different morphological types, Type A, Type B, Type B modified and Type D flattened circles, Type 1 and Type 2 eggs, ovals and true circles. He suggested several were built as astronomical complexes to predict eclipses via nineteen-year cycles. Thom went on to identify numerous solar and stellar alignments at stone circles, providing the foundations for the scientific discipline of archaeoastronomy. He further suggested the prehistoric peoples of Britain must have used a solar method of keeping calendar. Based on statistical histograms of observed declinations at horizon marks with no convenient star at ‚àí22¬∞, +8¬∞, +9¬∞ and +22¬∞ (except possibly Spica at +9¬∞) between 2100 and 1600 BC, he suggested a year based on sixteen months; four with twenty two days, eleven with twenty three days and one with twenty four. Thom's suggested megalithic solar year was divided by midsummer, midwinter and the two equinoxes into four and then subdivided into eight by early versions of the modern Christian festivals of Whitsun, Lammas, Martinmas and Candlemas (see Scottish Quarter Days). He found little evidence for further subdivision into thirty two, but noted \\"We do not know how sophisticated prehistoric man's calendar was, but the interesting thing is that he obtained declinations very close to those we have obtained as ideal\\". Thom explored these topics further in his later books, Megalithic sites in Britain (Oxford, 1967), Megalithic lunar observatories (Oxford, 1971) and Megalithic Remains in Britain and Brittany (Oxford, 1978), the last written with his son Archie after they carried out a detailed survey of the Carnac stones from 1970 to 1974. Thom's ideas met with resistance from the archaeological community but were welcomed amongst elements of 1960s counter- culture. Along with Gerald Hawkins' new interpretation of Stonehenge as an astronomical 'computer' (see Archaeoastronomy and Stonehenge), Thom's theories were adopted by numerous believers in the lost wisdom of the ancients and became commonly associated with pseudoscience,. In 1975, his wife, Jeanie died. In 1981 he underwent an eye operation and in 1982 he broke a femur falling on ice. He continued to write papers and undertook interviews and correspondence using a dictaphone with the assistance of audio typist, Hilda Gustin. He moved in with his daughter Beryl in 1983 in Banavie. Registered as blind, he concluded a final book Stone Rows and Standing Stones, a 557-page tome published posthumously with the assistance of Aubrey Burl in 1990. Alexander Thom died on 7 November 1985 at Fort William hospital, aged 91. His body was buried near Ayr. His son Alan died in a plane crash in 1945 and Archie died in 1995 from a brain tumour. He is survived by his daughter Beryl Austin and grandchildren. BBC Chronicle ‚Äì Cracking the Stone Age code The Broken Menhir of Er Grah suggested by Thom to have been once used for major lunar alignments in BBC Chronicle ‚Äì Cracking the Stone Age code In 1970, Thom appeared on a television documentary produced by the BBC Chronicle series, presented by Magnus Magnusson and featuring well known archaeologists, Dr Euan Mackie, Professor Richard J. C. Atkinson, Dr A. H. A. Hogg, Professor Stuart Piggott, Dr Jacquetta Hawkes, Dr Humphrey Case and Dr Glyn Daniel. The programme discussed the difference between orthodox archaeology and the radical ideas of Thom. A pinnacle of his career, Thom finally got to publicly deliver his message on national television. Despite the heavy criticism, he never vented his frustration on the archaeological profession as he said in the Chronicle program \\"I just keep reporting what I find\\".  Later use of his work  Thom's proposed length for the Megalithic yard has been reused as such in several controversial books that claim this unit of measurement is a subdivision of the Earth's circumference in an alleged 366-degree geometry. One such book is 'Civilization One: The World is Not as You Thought It Was', by Christopher Knight and Alan Butler who propose the 366 geometry theory. Clive Ruggles has said that both classical and Bayesian statistical reassessments of Thom's data \\"reached the conclusion that the evidence in favour of the MY was at best marginal, and that even if it does exist the uncertainty in our knowledge of its value is of the order of centimetres, far greater than the 1mm precision claimed by Thom. In other words, the evidence presented by Thom could be adequately explained by, say, monuments being set out by pacing, with the 'unit' reflecting an average length of pace.\\" David George Kendall had previously argued that pacing would have created a greater difference in measurements between sites, he concluded after investigation for the Royal Academy, that \\"The hypothesis of a smooth, non-quantal distribution of circle diameters (for Scottish, English and Welsh true circles) is thus rejected at the 1% level.\\" Douglas Heggie casts doubt on Thom's suggestion as well, stating that his careful analysis uncovered \\"little evidence for a highly accurate unit\\" and \\"little justification for the claim that a highly accurate unit was in use\\". Euan MacKie, recognising that Thom's theories needed to be tested, excavated at the Kintraw standing stone site in Argyllshire in 1970 and 1971 to check whether the latter's prediction of an observation platform on the hill slope above the stone was correct. There was an artificial platform there and this apparent verification of Thom's long alignment hypothesis (Kintraw was diagnosed as an accurate winter solstice site) led him to check Thom's geometrical theories at the Cultoon stone circle in Islay, also with a positive result. MacKie therefore broadly accepted Thom's conclusions and published new prehistories of Britain.[22] In contrast a re-evaluation of Thom's fieldwork by Clive Ruggles argued that Thom's claims of high accuracy astronomy were not fully supported by the evidence.[23] Nevertheless, Thom's legacy remains strong, Krupp wrote in 1979, \\"Almost singlehandedly he has established the standards for archaeoastronomical fieldwork and interpretation, and his amazing results have stirred controversy during the last three decades.\\" His influence endures and practice of statistical testing of data remains one of the methods of archaeoastronomy.MacKie 1977, Gingerich 2000, Krupp 1979:18, Hicks 1993 In his book Genes, Giants, Monsters and Men, Joseph P. Farrell states, \\"If Thom was right, the development of human civilization may have to be rewritten!\\" This Farrell surmises is why Thom encounters such opposition from certain groups. In his book Rings of Stone: The Prehistoric Stone Circles of Britain and Ireland.

They traditionally consisted of teenage and young adult heroes, and were often seen to serve as a junior counterpart to The Avengers in much the same way that the New Mutants/X-Force did with the X-Men. They first appeared in The Mighty Thor #411 (December 1989) as a cameo appearance but made their full debut in The Mighty Thor #412. Over the years the New Warriors, in their various incarnations, have been featured in five different volumes. The original New Warriors was created by editor Tom DeFalco who brought together existing Marvel comic book characters Firestar, Marvel Boy, Namorita, Nova and Speedball and added in the newly created Night Thrasher to form a team of young super heroes known as \\"The New Warriors\\". Through the 75 issue comic series the team fought a number of adversaries, including the second Sphinx, the Folding Circle and even the Fantastic Four. Over time the team was joined by Silhouette, Rage, Hindsight Lad, Bandit, Timeslip, Dagger, Darkhawk, Powerpax, Turbo and the Scarlet Spider. The second volume of New Warriors was published in 1999‚Äì2000 and ran for 11 issues before being cancelled. This team consisted of Namorita, Nova, Speedball and Turbo, joined by new members Bolt and Aegis. The third volume of the New Warriors was a six-issue mini series that sees the super hero team cast as the stars of their own reality TV show, Night Thrasher, Nova and Speedball were joined by Microbe and Debrii. The New Warriors are at the center of a televised fight against a number of super villains in Stamford, Connecticut where Nitro explodes, killing 612 people including several members of the New Warriors. The incident was one of the sparks that led to Marvel's Civil War crossover in 2006 and 2007. The fourth New Warriors series saw Night Thrasher gather a group of former mutants and replacing their lost super powers with technology. The comic book was published from 2007 to 2009 and lasted for 20 issues in total. During the story it is revealed that Night Thrasher is the original Night Thrasher's brother, formerly known as Bandit, who wants to travel back in time and change the events at Stamford that killed his brother. When they try to travel back in time the team ends up in a dystopic future where the original Night Thrasher is a ruthless dictator. When the New Warriors returned to their own time they disbanded. The fifth New Warriors series was launched as part of the All-New Marvel NOW! initiative in 2014. The book lasted for 12 issues before being cancelled. The story saw original New Warriors members Justice (formerly Marvel Boy), Speedball, and Silhouette return to team up with the new Nova, Scarlet Spider, Hummingbird, Sun Girl, Haechi and Water Snake. General publication history The New Warriors first appeared in issues 411 and 412 of the Marvel Comics title The Mighty Thor. The team was compiled by writer/editor Tom DeFalco, consisting of the young superheroes Firestar, Marvel Boy, Namorita, Nova and Speedball, all of whom were once featured in solo series or were supporting characters in more established series. To this mix DeFalco added Night Thrasher, an original character to serve as the team's founder and leader. The New Warriors were not sidekicks, as some prior teen superhero teams had been. The New Warriors were featured in an eponymous series from 1990 until 1996, written by Fabian Nicieza with art by Mark Bagley. Nicieza wrote the series for the first 53 issues. The series lasted for 75 issues and four annuals, spinning off a number of titles, including mini-series featuring Night Thrasher and Marvel Boy (by then renamed Justice) and ongoing series with Nova and Night Thrasher. A short-lived revival was launched in 1999, lasting for ten issues, and a mini-series followed in 2005. In the mini-series, the New Warriors agreed to star in a reality television show to fund their team. A fourth series was launched in June 2007, spinning off of events in the Civil War crossover. A new ongoing series started in February 2014, where a new team of New Warriors was brought together by the threat of the High Evolutionary who intended to eliminate the super-powered population of Earth. The New Warriors (vol. 1) Fictional team history Dwayne Taylor, the vigilante known as Night Thrasher meticulously researches a group of young heroes to help him wage a war on crime. They are Vance Astrovik aka Marvel Boy, Angelica Jones aka Firestar and Richard Rider, who at that time believed he had been depowered after quitting the Nova Corps. During their first battle with Terrax, a former herald of Galactus, they are joined by Robbie Baldwin aka Speedball and Namorita. They defeat Terrax, but the Avengers unintentionally end up taking the credit. The team decides to stay together and Speedball dubs them the New Warriors after a news report he had seen on the battle.New Warriors #1 The newly created team gets involved in a fight between Thor and Juggernaut,Thor #411‚Äì412 helping Thor to send the Juggernaut to another dimension.

This competition brings the Upstarts into conflict with the Warriors (Firestar is a former Hellion) and X-Force. The Upstarts capture most of their targets, but Paige Guthrie convinces the Gamesmaster to play another game: instead of killing mutants, the Upstarts should try to find and train young mutants like her.

Garthan Saal sacrifices himself against Volx, transferring his powers to Nova. Eventually, the reunited New Warriors defeat Volx, at the cost of Timeslip's powers.

Turbo decides to use the suit to continue on in Mike's honor, and offers Hindsight the chance to share it with her as Mike did.

While the conversation deviates to Justice's and Speedball's intention of reforming the New Warriors and the difficulties that that will probably bring due the team's persisting bad reputation for their involvement in the Civil War events, they notice the teleportation arrival into the town of a trio of enigmatic figures clad in advanced armor. One of these beings declares that \\"the blood here is tainted\\" and all must be burned down. In the ensuing fight, these three strange individuals tell Justice of how they once tried to help mutantkind but were instead betrayed by the X-Men. Eventually, Speedball and the rest of the Salem's Seven are drawn into the combat, but that is still not enough to halt the mysterious assailants who declare that Robbie is also \\"corrupted\\" ‚Äì \\"altered by an other-dimensional energy\\". The strangers knock out Brutacus, one of the town protectors, to later take a gene sample of him \\"as requested by their lord\\". Taking advantage of their enemies' distraction, Justice manages to land a telekinetic blow on the face of the trio's leader and crack his armor, revealing him to be a hairy humanoid. As Vance tries to parley with them, the enigmatic attackers simply continue their proclamations against the town's inhabitants and mutants, arguing there is no point trying to talk as \\"judgement is coming\\", to later teleport out of town.New Warriors vol. 5 #2 Armed with the scant facts they learned of their aggressors, Justice uses his telekinetic powers to propel himself and Speedball to Avengers Tower at a vertiginous velocity. They are met by an empty place with the exception of Edwin Jarvis, the tower's resident butler, who informs them that the Avengers are busy elsewhere and conducts them to the Avengers's database. There they discover a video file made by Cyclops that reveals the identity of the town attackers: the Evolutionaries, a group of pre-homo sapiens that had been transformed in the ancient past by Phastos of the Eternals, who gave them advanced intelligence, armor and power, and assigned them the mission to protect the most advanced human subspecies from the others; at that time, homo sapiens. But left to their own devices, the Evolutionaries had decided that the most advanced subspecies in the present were the mutants and that the best way to protect them was to annihilate the rest of humanity, a situation that the X-Men stopped. While pondering why the Evolutionaries had changed objectives once again, Justice and Speedball hear an alarm and the computer informs them of an emergency taking place on New York's subway system. With none else to attend to it, Justice asks Robbie if he can act as an Avenger for a day, to which Speedball responds that he won't: he will act as a [New] Warrior. They head out and arrive just in time to rescue Mark Sim and Sun Girl, two inexperienced heroes who had tried to stop a second group of Evolutionaries from killing the mutant Morlocks that live in New York's sewer near the subway. As the enemy flees with the arrival of Speedball and Justice, a new problem arises when police arrives to the scene and the officers start to panic at Mark Sim because his appearance coincides with ill-reported accounts of witnesses (and due the general public distress at the new Inhumans popping up from the general population in the aftermath of Thanos's recent invasion of Earth). As a shooting starts, the four heroes escape from there through the air with Justice shielding them from the bullets.New Warriors vol. 5 #3 As the four recover on the roof of a nearby building, Mark succumbs to his emotions, the incident with the police being the last's straw on a series of awful days since he gained his powers (and the horn on his head). The other three try to reassure him and calm his uncertainty at what the future holds for him. But an argument is bred between Justice and Sun Girl on differing opinions about it, which Robbie tries to broker or stop. To prove her point and to demonstrate Mark's energy absorption abilities, Sun Girl shoots the distressed young man, to the shock of Justice and Speedball. After the situation defuses, they discuss what to do with the Evolutionaries: Justice wants to leave this matter on the hands of the Avengers when they return, but Sun Girl convinces them to take care of it themselves. However, Justice wants to first find Nova, their New Warriors reservist member. Meanwhile, in the sunny beaches of Mazatlan, Mexico, Aracely and Kaine make a stop to look for food supplies after she depleted them with her constant snacking. Seeing that Nova doesn't answer his phone, they head back to the Salem's Seven and through their help and that of New Salem's magical inhabitants, they locate the boy. As it turns out, he along with Hummingbird, Scarlet Spider and Faira Sar Namora of Atlantis, were kidnapped separately by the Evolutionaries and the High Evolutionary, and were held as prisoners in Mount Wundagore. Rushing, they arrive as the Evolutionaries are about to execute Nova, following his and the other prisoners' attempt to break out. Justice tries to reason with the High Evolutionary, but as this one gives a cryptic refusal and Nova reveals his plan of eliminating \\"mostly everyone\\", they opt to skip the diplomacy. A chaotic fight ensues, with the prisoners, Sun Girl, Mark and the New Warriors forming an impromptu team that manages to defeat the small army of Evolutionaries through their diverse and very different powers and abilities.New Warriors vol. 5 #4 However, with his allies defeated, the High Evolutionary accelerates his plan and decides to activate the machine he was working on. Nova tries to stop him, but he is knocked unconscious by an energy blast. The others pursue the High Evolutionary and try to reanimate Nova, who manages to mumble to the team the machine's purpose ‚Äì killing \\"people with powers\\". The machine begins its process, bathing the entire mountain in a pinkish light: everyone on the team is then brought down to the ground as an excruciating sensation of pain torments their bodies and minds. Everyone but Sun Girl, who is a normal non-altered human without special genes, alien ancestry or magic. Noticing this, the High Evolutionary approaches her politely and explains that he didn't intended for the situation to occur in that manner; before the outbreak and the fight, he was trying to use Nova's helmet to allow his machine to work more efficiently and quickly, saving its victims of any lengthy pain as they die. Also, that he took no pleasure on any of these events and, as he had stated before, he would have wanted to act differently but had no time to do so; he had been informed that the Celestials ‚Äì a group of insanely powerful, impossibly technologically advanced, almost unstoppable aliens who had manipulated life across the universe since billions of years ago for their own mysterious purposes ‚Äì would come to \\"judge\\" Earth very soon. Should the Celestials find the inhabitants of a planet wanting, they would annihilate them and, allegedly, this time they expected Earth to contain only one dominant species: humanity, with no offshoots or deviations of any kind. Thus the reason the High Evolutionary created the machine to kill any mutant, inhuman, hybrid or person of any kind that could displease the Celestials.

On the evening of September 8, 1923, seven destroyers, while traveling at 20 knots (37 km/h), ran aground at Honda Point, a few miles from the northern side of the Santa Barbara Channel off Point Arguello on the coast in Santa Barbara County, California. Two other ships grounded, but were able to maneuver free off the rocks. Twenty-three sailors died in the disaster. Geography of Honda Point The area of Honda Point (also known as Point Pedernales) is extremely treacherous for central California mariners, as it features a series of rocky outcroppings, collectively known as Woodbury Rocks (one of which is today named Destroyer Rock on navigational charts). Called the Devil's Jaw, the area has been a navigational hazard since the Spanish explorers first came in the 16th century. It is just north of the entrance to the Santa Barbara Channel, which was the intended route of the destroyers involved in the disaster. Captain Edward Howe Watson Captain Edward H. Watson, an 1895 graduate of the United States Naval Academy, commanded Destroyer Squadron Eleven (DesRon 11). He had served during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the Philippine Insurrection, and World War I. Watson was promoted to captain in 1917. Assigned as commodore of DesRon 11 in July 1922, it was his first time as a unit commander.McKee, Irving. (1960). Captain Edward Howe Watson and the Honda Disaster. Pacific Historical Review, 29 (3), 287‚Äì305. Incident The fourteen ships of DesRon 11 were steaming south in column from San Francisco Bay to San Diego Bay on September 8, 1923. Captain Watson flew his flag on . All were s, less than five years old. The ships turned east to course 095, supposedly heading into the Santa Barbara Channel, at 21:00. The ships were navigating by dead reckoning, estimating positions from their course and speed, as measured by propeller revolutions per minute. At that time radio navigation aids were new and not completely trusted. USS Delphy was equipped with a radio navigation receiver, but her captain, Lieutenant Commander Donald T. Hunter, who was also acting as the squadron's navigator, ignored its indicated bearings, believing them to be erroneous. No effort was made to take soundings of water depths using a fathometer as this would require the ships to slow down to take the measurements. The ships were performing an exercise that simulated wartime conditions, and Captain Watson also wanted the squadron to make a fast passage to San Diego, so the decision was made not to slow down. Despite the heavy fog, Commodore Watson ordered all ships to travel in close formation and, turning too soon, went aground. Six others followed and sank. Two ships whose captains disobeyed the close- formation order survived, although they also hit the rocks.Baker, Gayle, Santa Barbara, HarborTown Histories, Santa Barbara, CA, 2003, p. 76 (print) 9780987903815 (on-line) Earlier the same day, the mail steamship ran aground nearby. Some attributed these incidents in the Santa Barbara Channel to unusual currents caused by the great Tokyo earthquake of the previous week. Navigational errors The fourteen Clemson-class destroyers of Destroyer Squadron Eleven were to follow the flagship USS Delphy in column formation from San Francisco Bay, through the Santa Barbara Channel, and finally to San Diego. Destroyer Squadron Eleven was on a twenty-four-hour exercise from northern California to southern California.Blackmore, David. (2004). Blunders and Disasters at Sea. Barnsley: Pen & Sword Maritime. The flagship was responsible for navigation. As the Delphy steamed along the coastline, poor visibility meant the navigators had to go by the age-old technique of dead reckoning. They had to estimate their position based on their speed and heading. The captain of the Delphy was also acting as the squadron's navigator, overriding his ship's navigator, Lieutenant (junior grade) Lawrence Blodgett. The Delphy did have radio direction finding (RDF) equipment, which picked up signals from a station at Point Arguello, but RDF was new and the bearings obtained were dismissed by Hunter as unreliable. Based solely on dead reckoning, Captain Watson ordered the fleet to turn east into the Santa Barbara Channel. However, the Delphy was actually several miles northeast of where they thought they were, and the error caused the ships to run aground on Honda Point. The Kennedy intercepted radio bearings to the Delphy and to the Stoddert, and accurately determined the fleet's position. When the Kennedy reached the turning point, Commander Walter G. Roper, in charge of Division 32 (Kennedy, Paul Hamilton, Stoddert, and Thompson) at the rear of the column, ordered his ships to slow down and then to stop, and avoided running aground. Ocean conditions At his court martial, LCdr. Hunter, the navigator of the Delphy, testified. \\"I think there is also a possibility that abnormal currents caused by the Japanese earthquake might have been another contributory cause, or magnetic disturbances connected with the solar eclipse affected the compass ‚Äî but of these I cannot, of course, speak with any first hand knowledge.\\" On September 1, 1923, seven days before the disaster, the Great Kant≈ç earthquake had occurred in Japan. Unusually large swells and strong currents arose off the coast of California and remained for a number of days. Before Destroyer Squadron Eleven even reached Honda Point, a number of ships had encountered navigational problems as a result of unusual currents. As DESRON 11 began their exercise run down the California coast, they made their way through these swells and currents. While the squadron was traveling through these swells and currents, their estimations of speed and bearing used for dead reckoning were being affected. The navigators aboard the lead ship Delphy did not take into account the effects of the strong currents and large swells in their estimations. Consequently, the entire squadron was off course and positioned near the treacherous coastline of Honda Point instead of the open ocean of the Santa Barbara Channel. Coupled with darkness and thick fog, the swells and currents attributed to the earthquake in Japan made accurate navigation by dead reckoning nearly impossible for the Delphy. The geography of Honda Point, which is completely exposed to wind and waves, created a deadly environment once the unusually strong swells and currents were added to the coastline. Once the error in navigation occurred, the weather conditions and ocean conditions sealed the fate of the squadron. The weather surrounding Honda Point at the time of the disaster was windy and foggy while the geography of the area created strong counter-currents and swells that forced the ships into the rocks once they entered the area.

Instead, she ran aground. Light damage was recorded by: * ran aground, but was able to extricate herself and was not lost. * was lightly damaged. The remaining five ships avoided the rocks:  * Rescue efforts Rescue attempts promptly followed the accident. Local ranchers, who were alerted by the commotion of the disaster, rigged up breeches buoys from the surrounding clifftops and lowered them down to the ships that had run aground. Fishermen nearby who had seen the tragedy picked up members of the crew from USS Fuller and USS Woodbury. The crew aboard the capsized Young was able to climb to safety on the nearby USS Chauncey via a lifeline. The five destroyers in Destroyer Squadron Eleven that avoided running aground at Honda Point were also able to contribute to rescue efforts by picking up sailors who had been thrown into the water and by assisting those who were stuck aboard the wreckage of other ships. After the disaster, the government did not attempt to salvage any of the wrecks at Honda Point due to the nature of the damage each ship sustained. The wrecks themselves, along with the equipment that remained on them, were sold to a scrap merchant for a total of $1,035. The wrecked ships were still not moved by late , since they may be clearly seen in film footage taken from the German airship Graf Zeppelin as she headed towards Los Angeles on her circumnavigation of the globe; the film footage is used in the documentary film Farewell (2009). Court martial E.H. Watson, shown here as a commander, 1915 The seven- officer Navy court-martial board, presided over by Vice Admiral Henry A. Wiley, commander battleship divisions of the Battle Fleet,Los Angeles Times. November 2, 1923. p. 12 ruled that the disaster was the fault of the fleet commander and the flagship's navigators. They assigned blame to the captain of each ship that ran aground, following the tradition that a captain's first responsibility is to his own ship, even when in formation. Eleven officers involved were brought before general courts-martial on the charges of negligence and culpable inefficiency to perform one's duty. This was the largest single group of officers ever court-martialed in the U.S. Navy's history. The court martial ruled that the events of the Honda Point Disaster were \\"directly attributable to bad errors and faulty navigation\\" by Captain Watson. Watson was stripped of his seniority, and three other officers were admonished. Those officers who were court-martialed were all acquitted. Captain Watson, who had been defended by Admiral Thomas Tingey Craven, was commended by his peers and the government for assuming full responsibility for the disaster at Honda Point. He could have tried to blame a variety of factors for the disaster, but instead, he set an example for those others by accepting the responsibility entirely on his shoulders. A Court of Inquiry recommended Cmdr. Roper for a Letter of Commendation for turning his division away from danger. Honda Point today Plaque commemorating the Honda Point disaster Honda Point, also called Point Pedernales, is located on the seacoast at Vandenberg Air Force Base, near the city of Lompoc, California. There is a plaque and a memorial to the disaster at the site. The memorial includes a ship's bell from Chauncey. A propeller and a propeller shaft from Delphy is on display outside the Veterans' Memorial Building, in Lompoc, California.

It is bowled by fast bowlers. A bowler releases a normal spin delivery with the wrist locked in position and the first two fingers positioned on top of the cricket ball, giving it spin about a horizontal axis perpendicular to the length of the pitch. For a leg cutter, a right-handed bowler pulls his fingers down the left side of the ball (from his viewpoint), rolling the ball out of his hand over the little finger, in an action similar to bowling a leg break, only at higher speed. This changes the axis of spin to make it more like a leg break, which makes the ball deviate to the left when it bounces on the pitch. From a right-handed batsman's point of view, this deviation is to the right, or from the leg side towards the off side. This deviation is known as cut, and the delivery is called a leg cutter because it moves away from the leg side. What differentiates a genuine leg cutter from a seam-up delivery that simply moves away off the seam is that it is deliberately bowled. Leg cutters do not turn as sharply as leg breaks bowled by a leg spin bowler, but at the speed of a fast bowler even a tiny deviation can cause difficulties for the batsman. If he is not quick enough to react to the movement, the batsman can edge the ball off the outside edge of his bat, offering a catch to the wicket-keeper or slips fielders. A fast bowler will typically use the leg cutter as a variation ball as it is most effective when it surprises the batsman. The leg cutter action can also produce a significantly slower ball with little obvious change in the bowler's arm speed, making the delivery doubly deceptive. On the other hand, the lack of pace of the delivery may be disadvantageous. Former Australian captain Ian Chappell described Jeff Thomson's leg cutter thus: \\"He had this leg cutter, and you were usually pretty happy to see it, because it meant that the ball wasn't coming at your head at 95 miles an hour.\\" The most prominent users of leg cutter include Alec Bedser, Fazal Mahmood and of late Terry Alderman, Carl Rackemann and Venkatesh Prasad. Leg cutters are much more frequently seen in indoor cricket as the physical arena in which the game is played limits the pace at which bowlers can bowl, and hence they must use other techniques to prevent the batsmen from scoring.

This deviation is known as cut, and the delivery is called an off cutter because it moves away from the off side. What differentiates a genuine off cutter from a delivery that simply nips back off the seam is that it is deliberately bowled. A fast off cutter can also be bowled by placing the index and middle fingers on one side of the vertical seam, with the remaining fingers spread and tensed on the opposite side of the ball, as used by Brian Statham and Ray Lindwall. Off cutters do not turn as sharply as off breaks bowled by an off spin bowler, but at the speed of a fast bowler even a tiny deviation can cause difficulties for the batsman. If he is not quick enough to react to the movement, the batsman can miss the ball with his bat and be bowled between bat and pad or out leg before wicket if struck on the pads. A fast bowler will typically use the off cutter as a variation ball, as it is most effective when it surprises the batsman. Waqar Younis, Mustafizur Rahman, Glenn McGrath, Richard Hadlee, and Fred Trueman managed a bagful of wickets with this delivery because of the accurate lengths at which they operated, between fuller and good lengths (ball landing 2 to 3 steps in front of the batsman) at close to the off stump line. The surprise comes because, when facing rigorously accurate off-side bowlers, like those mentioned above, batters usually incorporate plans to leave the ball, or exaggerate foot movements to the pitch of the ball in anticipation. The calling card of this delivery, for the batsman to read it in advance, is the typical wobble in the seam after ball release with the seam slanting predominantly towards the batsman. A simple way for a beginner to learn to bowl cutters is to try imparting strong back-spin to the ball by pulling down on the seam at the time of release while keeping the seam vertical. Cutters work especially well on pitches that are rough, or when the ball lands on cracks on the surface. Such surfaces grip the seam and stop the reverse rotation, leading to considerable deviation as well as causing the ball to keep low after pitching. In the latter case, the balls are also called 'shooters'. Lance Klusener used this tactic in matches in the West Indies and the Indian subcontinent, particularly in one match in Calcutta towards the end of his career when he had lost some of his speed. In test matches, bowlers tend to 'work the cracks' using cutters, meaning that they try pitching the ball on cracks repeatedly with the result that few of the balls that do pitch on cracks unsettles even a well-set batsman. In contemporary cricket, the off- cutter is primarily used as a slower ball in limited over cricket.

He retired in 2007. He is a prolific writer of popular chemistry textbooks, including Physical Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry, and Molecular Quantum Mechanics. Atkins is also the author of a number of popular science books, including Atkins' Molecules, Galileo's Finger: The Ten Great Ideas of Science and On Being. Career Atkins left school (Dr Challoner's Grammar School, Amersham) at fifteen and took a job at Monsanto as a laboratory assistant. He studied for A-levels by himself and gained a place, following a last-minute interview, at the University of Leicester. Atkins studied chemistry there, obtaining a BSc degree in chemistry, and a PhD degree in 1964 for research into electron spin resonance spectroscopy, and other aspects of theoretical chemistry. Atkins then took a postdoctoral position at UCLA as a Harkness Fellow of the Commonwealth fund. He returned to Britain in 1965 as a fellow and tutor of Lincoln College, Oxford, and lecturer in physical chemistry (later, professor of physical chemistry). In 1969, he won the Royal Society of Chemistry's Meldola Medal. In 1996 he was awarded the Title of Distinction of Professor of Chemistry. He retired in 2007, and since then has been a full-time author. He has honorary doctorates from the University of Utrecht, the University of Leicester (where he sits on the university Court), Mendeleev University in Moscow, and Kazan State Technological University. He was a member of the Council of the Royal Institution and the Royal Society of Chemistry. He was the founding chairman of IUPAC Committee on Chemistry Education, and is a trustee of a variety of charities. Atkins has lectured in quantum mechanics, quantum chemistry, and thermodynamics courses (up to graduate level) at the University of Oxford. He is a patron of the Oxford University Scientific Society. In 2016 Atkins received the James T. Grady-James H. Stack Award for Interpreting Chemistry for the Public from the American Chemical Society. Views on religion Atkins is a well-known atheist. He has written and spoken on issues of humanism, atheism, and the incompatibility of science and religion. According to Atkins, whereas religion scorns the power of human comprehension, science respects it. He was the first Senior Member of the Oxford University Secular Society, a Distinguished Supporter of Humanists UK (formerly known as the British Humanist Association) and an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society. He is also a member of the Advisory Board of The Reason Project, a US-based charitable foundation devoted to spreading scientific knowledge and secular values in society. The organisation is led by fellow atheist and author Sam Harris. Atkins has regularly participated in debates with theists such as Alister McGrath, Stephen C. Meyer, Dr. Hugh Ross, William Lane Craig, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach,Rabbi Shmuley Boteach and Richard Swinburne. In December 2006, Atkins was featured in a UK television documentary on atheism called The Trouble with Atheism, presented by Rod Liddle. In that documentary Liddle asked Atkins: \\"Give me your views on the existence, or otherwise, of god\\". Atkins replied: \\"Well it's fairly straightforward: there isn't one. And there's no evidence for one, no reason to believe that there is one, and so I don't believe that there is one. And I think that it is rather foolish that people do think that there is one\\". Atkins is known for his use of astringent language in criticising religion: he appeared in the 2008 documentary Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed, in which he told interviewer Ben Stein that religion was \\"a fantasy\\", and \\"completely empty of any explanatory content. It is also evil\\".'Expelled' documentary explores Darwin, Intelligent Design, religion debate . Christianexaminer.com. Retrieved on 27 August 2011. He appeared on a television panel about science and religion with Richard Dawkins and Richard Swinburne. When the latter tried to explain the Holocaust as God's way of giving Jews the opportunity to be brave and noble, Atkins growled: \\"May you rot in hell\\". In 2007, Atkins's position on religion was described by Colin Tudge in an article in The Guardian as being non-scientific. In the same article, Atkins was also described as being 'more hardline than Richard Dawkins', and of deliberately choosing to ignore Peter Medawar's famous adage that \\"Science is the art of the soluble\\". Private life Atkins married Judith Kearton in 1964 and they had one daughter, Juliet (born 1970). They divorced in 1983. In 1991, he married fellow scientist Susan Greenfield (later Baroness Greenfield). They divorced in 2005. In 2008, he married Patricia-Jean Nobes (n√©e Brand).

He won the American League Rookie of the Year Award in 1978, and was a five-time MLB All-Star in his career. He won four Silver Slugger Awards and three Gold Glove Awards. Along with teammate Alan Trammell, Whitaker was part of the longest running double play combination in MLB history. Early life Whitaker was born in Brooklyn, New York City. When he was one year old, his mother, who was pregnant with his sister, Matilda, moved with Lou to Martinsville, Virginia, to live with her family. Whitaker attended Martinsville High School. He played for the school's baseball team as a middle infielder and pitcher. Whitaker graduated in 1975, and committed to play college baseball for Ferrum College. Professional playing career The Detroit Tigers selected Whitaker in the fifth round, with the 99th overall selection, of the 1975 MLB draft. He signed with the Tigers rather than attend college. He made his professional debut that year for the Bristol Tigers of the Rookie-level Appalachian League. He played for the Lakeland Tigers of the Class A Florida State League in 1976. The team's starting third baseman, he batted .297 and was named the league's most valuable player.https://www.si.com/vault/1983/09/12/619015/short-to- second-to-none After the 1976 season, the Tigers assigned Whitaker to the Arizona Instructional League, where they converted him into a second baseman and paired him with shortstop Alan Trammell. In 1977, they both played for the Montgomery Rebels of the Double-A Southern League, Whitaker batting .280 during the season. The two were both promoted to the Major Leagues late in the 1977 season and had become starters for the Tigers by the end of April 1978. They would remain teammates until Whitaker retired in 1995. Trammell and Whitaker also made a cameo appearance together on the television show Magnum, P.I. starring Tom Selleck, as themselves, during the 1983 season. In 1978, Whitaker won the American League Rookie of the Year Award, hitting .285 with 71 runs, and a .361 on-base percentage. Tiger Stadium in 1981 Whitaker enjoyed a strong season in 1983, hitting for a .320 average with 12 home runs, 72 runs batted in (RBI), and 94 runs. That year he made the first of five consecutive All-Star appearances. In 1984, Whitaker and the Tigers won the World Series. The day Detroit clinched the Series, the second eldest of Whitaker's four daughters was born. In 1985, Whitaker set a record for Detroit second basemen with 21 home runs and, in 1986, was a member of a Tigers infield in which every member hit at least twenty home runs. He hit a career- best 28 homers in 1989, one of four times he reached the 20-HR plateau, upping his record for the most homers in a season by a Tiger second baseman. Whitaker now shares the season record with Ian Kinsler, who hit 28 homers in 2016 as the Tigers regular second baseman. Whitaker reached three career milestones in 1992, recording his 2,000th game, 2,000th hit, and his 200th home run.https://www.newspapers.com/image/99675527/?terms=lou%2Bwhitaker Along with his American League contemporaries Frank White and Willie Randolph, Whitaker set the standard for defensive play at his position throughout the 1980s. Whitaker is also one of only 19 players ever to hit a ball over the roof of Tiger Stadium.https://detroithistorical.pastperfectonline.com/bysearchterm?keyword=Tiger+Stadium Whitaker was an effective leadoff man, adept at drawing walks (averaging 81 BB per 162 games), quick on the bases, and able to drive the ball with power to all fields. In his 19-year career, Whitaker batted .276 with 244 home runs, 1,084 RBI, 1,386 runs, 2,369 hits, 420 doubles, 65 triples, and 143 stolen bases in 2,390 games. He also recorded a 1.089 walk-to-strikeout ratio. Defensively, he recorded a .984 fielding percentage playing every inning of his career at second base. His career Wins Against Replacement (WAR) of 75.1 ranks 51st all-time among position players, and is higher than all but six second basemen. He retired following the 1995 season. Whitaker is unique among long-career players in that he had the highest OPS of his career in his final season, .890 in 1995. Equally unique, Whitaker's OPS actually improved in each of his three final seasons. After retirement, Whitaker became an instructor for the Tigers during their spring training sessions in Lakeland, Florida, where he helped coaching hitters through the 2009 season. He and the Tigers parted ways in 2010 by mutual agreement. All-Star Games Whitaker was selected to the Major League Baseball All-Star Game five times: 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987. In the 1985 All-Star Game, Whitaker forgot to pack his uniform. Making this discovery just before the game, he had to make do with replica merchandise available for purchase at the park. He obtained an adjustable mesh hat and a blank jersey. He finished off his outfit by scrawling his number on the back in magic marker (or, by some accounts, having a fan do so for him). The Smithsonian requested the jersey and it remains a part of their collection. During the 1986 All-Star Game, Whitaker was one of the five players struck out consecutively by National League pitcher Fernando Valenzuela, tying Carl Hubbell's mark. Whitaker later hit a two-run homer in the game, which the American League won 3-2. Team records Whitaker ranks among the Tigers' all-time leaders in many categories, including the following: * 1,099 strikeouts #2 in franchise history. * 1,527 double plays #1 in franchise history. * 1,197 bases on balls #2 in franchise history. * 6,653 assists #2 in franchise history. * 2,390 games played #3 in franchise history. * 143 times grounded into a double play #3 in franchise history. * 11,613 total chances #4 in franchise history * 1,386 runs scored #4 in franchise history * 75 time caught stealing #4 in franchise history. * 412 doubles #5 in franchise history. * 3,651 total bases #5 in franchise history. * 2,369 hits #6 in franchise history. * 244 home runs #6 in franchise history. * 729 extra base hits #6 in franchise history. * 1,084 RBIs #8 in franchise history. * 189 errors #10 in franchise history * 143 stolen bases #10 in franchise history. Legacy Although the team has not officially retired Whitaker's jersey, there has been some debate among fans on social media outlets and on sports talk radio when it was announced in August 2013 that newly acquired infielder Jos√© Iglesias would take over the number. Iglesias was the first player to wear jersey #1 since Whitaker's retirement in 1995. Upon joining the Tigers in 2019, Josh Harrison chose to wear number 1 to honor Whitaker, again sparking debate over the number's status. On December 17, 2019, the Tigers announced that they would retire the number on August 29, 2020. Whitaker was considered for election to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) in , but received only 15 votes (2.9%). His low vote total surprised many observers, including Bill James, who named Whitaker the thirteenth-best second baseman of all time in The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract.Bill James Baseball Abstract 2001 Candidates receiving less than 5% of BBWAA votes are removed from future BBWAA ballots, but may be considered by applicable committees that review candidates from different eras in baseball history. Whitaker was considered by the Modern Baseball Era Committee for the induction class, but fell short of the required 75% threshold for induction, receiving six votes from the 16-member committee (37.5%).

The EMS was setup to adjust exchange rate, (both the nominal and the real exchange rate) in order to establish closer monetary cooperation. The aim was to foster closer monetary cooperation and lead to a zone of monetary stability which was commencement in 1979 and worked until 1992; after that, the European monetary policy replaced the EMU. European Monetary System and attribution policy existed from 1 March 1979 and worked until at the year 1999 where exchange rates for Euro area countries were fixed by Euro in the new policy of EMU. 50px Text was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. European Monetary system was established in 1979 under the Roy Jenkins, President of the European Commission where most of the nations of European Economic Community (EEC) linked their currencies to prevent large fluctuations relative to one another. EMS was succeed by the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union (EMU) which was established in 1992, EMU represented a major step of integration in the EU economics and founded a common currency called Euro. Since 1979, the European Monetary System considered as the benefits conferred by a system of managed currencies where exchange rates was based on stable but adaptable exchange rate. The main objective of the EMS was to establish an Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) to reduce exchange rate variability, achieve monetary stability in Europe and European Currency Unit (ECU) was introduced in that time as a weight basket of all EEC currencies. The official EMS entered into force on March 13, 1979 with the participation of eight Member States (France, Denmark, Belgium, Luxembourg, Ireland, Netherlands, Germany and Italy).  Historical Timeline  The origin of the EMS started with former European Community (EC), now European Union (EU) (which was also former European Economic Community) with the plan and initiatives by the leader of the European Community. In the end of 1960, in the Hague (in the Netherlands), the Heads of the Member State (known as European Council today) of EC agreed to move along the road to a full economic union. In 1969, the Heads of the State or Government of the Community had decided to create an economic and monetary union to complete into 1980. In response upon on the request, a group of experts, led by the Prime Minister and Minister of Finance of Luxembourg, Pierre Werner, elaborated the first plan in 1970. The Werner Committee was established prior to the Werner report which was published on 8 October 1970 and was the main successor of the EMS. On the basis of Werner report, the EEC moved to a single economy into three stages, with a fixed exchange rate but no single currency. In October 1972, the EEC's Paris summit agreed with the Werner plan and EEC currencies were linked through \\"the Snake\\". The Community adopted a resolution for instituting the European Monetary System on 5 December 1978 in Brussels by with the central idea of French President Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing and German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt at European Council meeting. The main policies were to follow independent budgetary, monetary policies and the exchange rate. The well-structured form of EMS was welcome for the monetary and exchange policy outcome with the participation of the Member States. In 1988, a committee was set up under the Commission President Jacques Delors to make a new hard EMS that provided favorable starting conditions for the transition to Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The Delors plan recommended a three-stage process lead to a single European currency under the control of a European Central Bank and it led to the adoption of Euro as a currency. Overview After the demise of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, most of the leaders of EC countries agreed in 1972 to maintain stable exchange rates by preventing exchange rate fluctuations of more than +/-2.25% (called European \\"currency snake\\"), Italy exceptionally benefited from a wider +/-6% margin, these permissible was so-called ‚Äòfluctuation bandwidths‚Äô. In this time, the EMS was a formal objective of stabilizing the currency rates and also maintain the competitiveness of its Member Countries, their plan was to achieve real and nominal exchange rates. The EMS was consisted of two main elements: one was about an agreement on a Community exchange-rate regime, another was about the decision to create a European Monetary Cooperation Fund (EMCF). Moreover, the members of the EEC countries participated in Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) because all of them were belonged to EMS policy, although Member States could opt out of the ERM if they had a valid reason. In March 1979, all idea were replaced by the European Monetary System, and the European Currency Unit (ECU) was defined at the end. The EMS has four basic functional arrangements are: 1.The ECU: With this arrangement, member currencies agreed to keep their foreign exchange rates within agreed bands with a narrow band of +/‚àí 2.25% and a wide band of +/‚àí 6%. 2\\\\. An Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) : The main aim was to reduce exchange rate variability and achieve monetary stability. 3\\\\. An extension of European credit facilities : The aim was to provide enough credit facilities for a country who is ready to proceed to its convertibility in order to get loan easily. 4\\\\. The issue of a new reserve asset, to create European Monetary Cooperation Fund: created in October 1972 and allocated ECU to members' central banks in exchange for gold and US dollar deposits. The EMS in many ways, was very similar to the Bretton Woods system in its policies and constituency. The similarities was that the role of European Monetary System was based on Deutsche Mark and the Bretton Woods system was based on U. S. Dollar. The European monetary system of the exchange-rate regime constituted a kind of Bretton Woods par value system on a European scale. Although no currency was designated as an anchor, the Deutsche Mark and German Bundesbank emerged as center of the EMS. Germany emerged as the dominant player within the EMS, set its monetary policy largely autonomously while other ERM members had attempted to converge on the German standard of Deutsche Mark which makes EMS highly asymmetrical. The German money supply played a role because of the lagged value of French money supply which were jointly insignificant. That was the way where German monetary policy transmitted into European Monetary System area, because of its relative strength of growth rate and the low-inflation policies of the bank, all other currencies were forced to follow its lead if they wanted to stay inside the system. The convergence rate was in German standard rather than the symmetry policy responded policy of it. Eventually, this situation led to dissatisfaction in most countries, and was one of the primary force behind the drive to a monetary union. The Deutsche Bundesbank determined the European monetary policy, fixed the reference level of the interest rates and the exchange rate in regard to dollar; although in the first ten months of 1979, the Deutsche Mark continued to rise both against the dollar within the snake. Basically, there were two phase of the European Monetary System. (a) The flexible system of EMS (1979-1986) : In this period, various adjustment of parity were taken place and Member Countries of the former EEC, had enjoyed a certain degree of autonomy in monetary policy by the given restriction on capital movements. Exchange rate were possible through certain adjustment also. (B) The rigid system of EMS (1987-1992) : In this period, it was decided not to conduct readjustment despite significant changes in the real exchange rates of some countries. There was gradually shrink of monetary policy and readjustment were substantially absent. 1992 crisis The early period of year 1990 started with crisis of the European Monetary System. There were some steps where EMS faced the crisis in whole period of EMS. After establishment of the European Single Market in 1986 where main theme was to remove the control on capital movements. The crisis started when the adjustment of the exchange rate was became problematic because of the control of capital movements. Periodic adjustments raised the value of strong currencies and lowered those of weaker ones, so in 1986 changes of national interest rates were used to keep the currencies within a narrow range. In the early 1990, the European Monetary System was strained by the differing economic policies and conditions of its members, especially the newly reunified Germany, and Britain (which had initially declined to join and did so in 1990) permanently withdrew from the system in September 1992. The opt out of Danish referendum from EMU in 1992 and exchange rate of the currencies from weaker countries of EMS also stimulated the crisis. Speculative attacks on the French Franc during the following year led to the so-called Brussels compromise in August 1993 which established a new fluctuation band of +15% on each side for all the participating currencies. In August 1993, the ERM fluctuation bands were broadened from +/-2.25% to +/- 15% against central parity. The Bundesbank reduced the official interest rates and UK, Italy were affected by large capital outflows. Both Italy and UK between 1987 and 1992 were affected by a significant appreciation of the real exchange rate and then hit by the crisis; after the crisis, they planned to withdraw from ERM. In September 1992 and again in August 1993, the European Monetary System was hit by a major several crisis. However, the outcome as follows : ‚Ä¢ On 13 September 1992 Italy decided to devalue Italian Lira by 7% (other currencies revalue of 3.5%: Lira devalues 3.5%) ‚Ä¢ On 16 September 1992 UK withdrew from ERM. ‚Ä¢ On 17 September 1992 Italy withdrew from ERM. Background European currency exchange rate stability has been one of the most important objectives of European policy makers since the Second World War. EMS provided a favorable starting condition for the transaction to Economic and Monetary Union. Between late 1982 and 1987, the different position on the money stability such as; the Dutch guilder remained quite stable in regard to the Mark, the Italian lira exhibited a sharp downward trend throughout the whole EMS period; finally the French franc, the Belgian franc, the Danish krona and the Irish pound switched from a trend of successive devaluations to stability. The Council of the European Union Ministers finalized in designing the EMS was the creation of a new monetary unit, the European Currency Unit (ECU). ECU was a composite of monetary unit of account which was based on basket for all EEC countries on specified amounts of each Community currency in the ECU was fixed, the weights of the various currencies change over time, as intra-European exchange rates fluctuated. Two primary factors account for this: * The history of exchange rate instability leading to social and economic instability, for example during the hyper inflation after the First World War in Germany or the competitive devaluations of the 1930s. * The inter-dependence and \\"openness\\" of European economies.  Stage I  During the first stage, there was very closer economic policy coordination happened by the Community and the liberalization of capital movements. Stage II The European Monetary System was no longer a functional arrangement in May 1998 as the Member countries fixed their mutual exchange rates when participating in the Euro. Its successor however, the ERM-II, was launched on 1 January 1999. The establishment of the European Monetary Institute (EMI). Member States are required to work to fulfill the five convergence criteria on inflation, interest rates, government deficit and debt, and exchange rate stability. In ERM-II, the ECU basket was discarded and the new single currency euro has become an anchor for the other currencies participated in the ERM-II. Participation in the ERM-II is voluntary and the fluctuation bands remain the same as in the original ERM, i.e. +15 percent, once again with the possibility of individually setting a narrower band with respect to the euro. Denmark and Greece became new members. Stage III The ERM-II is sometimes described as \\"waiting room\\" for joining the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union. The third and final stage dominated by the introduction of the Euro (currencies of the most countries of the European union, basically the Eurozone countries are using Euro). The Madrid European Summit on 15 and 16 December 1995 was set the start date for stage 3 on 1 January 1999, fixed the final euro conversion rates of the participated monetary units, and finished in 2002 with the introduction of euro notes and coins. In the EMU (stage III) the actual currencies in the participating member states are replaced by euro banknotes and coins and entered into the Eurozone.  Criticism  In the assessment of the credibility of the European Monetary System, Michael J Artis (1987) criticized that the EMS had low credible during the first eight years in the EMS history, the system demonstrated its resilience and had worked relatively non-smoothly. He also remarked that EMS was supposed to have contributed to improve the stability of the intra-EMS bilateral exchange rates but the improvement was less marked for effective rates and stability had weakened with the passage of time. Another criticism led by Paul De Grauwe (1987) about the credibility and limited criteria of the EMS policy. In 1979, when EMS entered into force, GDP growth rate, investment growth rate, stability of exchange rate and interest rates declined dramatically. In 1980, there was a rise of unemployment after the EMS system. Both the average EMS the unemployment rate and the inflation differential had a significant effect on EMS credibility. The macroeconomic performance of the small EMS countries experienced larger declines in investment, whereas before the EMS they had experienced relatively faster growth rates. About Exchange rate stability was quite powerless that was not much succeed in long term changes and real exchange rates. Whereas, real exchange rates are more important for investment, output, export and import decisions. It was only succeed in reducing short-term changes in bilateral exchange rates and nominal exchange rates. Indeed, inflation rates continued to differ widely within EMS. For example, Inflation rates of the nine members of the European Community vary 3 percent in Germany and 13 percent in only Italy. Finally, the interest rates for both nominal and real interest rates increased substantially after 1979 and EMS provided a little benefit to its members in terms of monetary and financial stability. Furthermore, the degree of cooperation was too small to have significant benefits. The smaller EMS economics such as Belgium, Denmark and Ireland possess short term credibility but lack of long term credibility, on the other hand the highest long run credible found for Germany and the Netherlands, which both had low inflation record. Additionally, Axel A. Weber (1991) also refers that the EMS was a de facto Deutsche Mark zone. Moreover, it was often called ‚Äútie one hands‚Äù because the policy adopted a fixed exchange rate which had short-run effects. The Bundesbank independently choose its monetary policy whilst all remaining EMS member countries by tied their hands on monetary policy and simply target their exchange rates to the German mark.

He played for the Chicago White Sox from 1917 to 1920. He is best known for his involvement in the 1919 Black Sox scandal. Background Charles Risberg was born and raised in San Francisco, California. He had very little education growing up and dropped out of school in the third grade. However, he soon developed a reputation as a good semipro pitcher and began his professional baseball career in 1912. Risberg soon converted to shortstop. In 1914, he hit .366 in the Class D Union Association\\"Swede Risberg Minor League Statistics & History\\". baseball-reference.com. Retrieved 2010-10-24. and was acquired by the Venice Tigers of the Pacific Coast League. He was the club's utility infielder in 1915 and 1916, gaining acclaim for his defensive skills. He was then bought by the American League's Chicago White Sox in early 1917.\\"Swede Risberg\\". bioproj.sabr.org. Retrieved 2010-10-24. Major League Baseball Risberg made his debut on April 11, 1917 for the White Sox. He was a below-average hitter, but due to his superb defensive abilities, he won the full-time job at shortstop. Late in the season, though, Risberg went into a terrible slump, and he therefore only pinch hit twice when the Sox beat the New York Giants in the 1917 World Series. The next season, Risberg briefly returned to California to work in a shipyard as part of the war effort. Although his job was termed essential and enabled him to avoid the draft, it consisted largely of playing baseball, as he batted .308 for the shipyard ballclub. Risberg returned to the Sox for the pennant-winning 1919 season. In September, he received good press in the Atlanta Constitution, which labeled him a \\"miracle man\\" who had \\"blossomed out as a wonder\\" after making four plays that were \\"phenomenal.\\" Chicago was heavy favorites in 1919 World Series versus the Cincinnati Reds. However, a group of White Sox players, including Risberg, decided to intentionally lose the series in exchange for monetary payments from a network of gamblers. Risberg was one of the ringleaders, helping to convince some of his teammates to go along with the scheme. In the eight-game series, he went 2 for 25 at the plate and made a Series-record eight errors. Risberg received $15,000 for his role in the fix, which was over four times his regular season salary. The scandal broke in late 1920, and though the eight players were acquitted in the trial that followed, they were all banned from organized baseball by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis.\\"Swede Risberg's Obit\\". thedeadballera.com. Retrieved 2010-10-24. Later years Risberg continued to play semi-pro baseball for a decade after his banishment. According to one source, \\"he came to Minnesota in 1922 with a traveling team called the Mesaba Range Black Sox, which featured two other members of the 1919 Black Sox team: Happy Felsch and Lefty Williams.\\"\\"Swede Risberg\\". 1919blacksox.com. Retrieved 2010-10-24. He played throughout the midwest United States and Canada. Columbus, North Dakota newspaper reports claimed that Risberg played part of the 1927 season with a traveling team called Dellage's Cubans based in Lignite, North Dakota. In 1926, Risberg was called to testify about a 1919 gambling scandal involving Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker. Although he presented no evidence regarding the 1919 scandal, he claimed that in 1917 he had collected money from other White Sox players to give to the Detroit Tigers so the Tigers would intentionally lose some games. However, his story was contradicted by over 30 other men, and it was disregarded. Risberg also worked on a dairy farm. After his outlaw baseball career ended, he eventually ran a tavern and lumber business in the northwest United States. During his playing days, he had been spiked by an opposing player; the injury never properly healed, and he eventually had to have his leg amputated. At the end of his life, he lived with his son and remained an avid baseball fan. Risberg died in Red Bluff, California, in 1975, on his 81st birthday. He was the last living Black Sox player. Risberg was portrayed by actor Don Harvey in the 1988 film Eight Men Out.

List of concepts Though there are more Greek words for love, variants and possibly subcategories, a general summary considering these Ancient Greek concepts are as follows: * Ag√°pe ( ag√°pƒì) means \\"love: esp. charity; the love of God for man and of man for a good God\\". Agape is used in ancient texts to denote feelings for one's children and the feelings for a spouse, and it was also used to refer to a love feast. Agape is used by Christians to express the unconditional love of God for his children.Romans 5:5, 5:8 This type of love was further explained by Thomas Aquinas as \\"to will the good of another\\". * √âros (·ºîœÅœâœÇ √©r≈çs) means \\"love, mostly of the sexual passion\\".·ºîœÅœâœÇ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus The Modern Greek word \\"erotas\\" means \\"intimate love\\". Plato refined his own definition: Although eros is initially felt for a person, with contemplation it becomes an appreciation of the beauty within that person, or even becomes appreciation of beauty itself. Plato does not talk of physical attraction as a necessary part of love, hence the use of the word platonic to mean, \\"without physical attraction\\". In the Symposium, the most famous ancient work on the subject, Plato has Socrates argue that eros helps the soul recall knowledge of beauty, and contributes to an understanding of spiritual truth, the ideal Form of youthful beauty that leads us humans to feel erotic desire ‚Äì thus suggesting that even that sensually based love aspires to the non- corporeal, spiritual plane of existence; that is, finding its truth, just like finding any truth, leads to transcendence. Lovers and philosophers are all inspired to seek truth through the means of eros. *Philia (œÜŒπŒªŒØŒ± phil√≠a) means \\"affectionate regard, friendship\\", usually \\"between equals\\".œÜŒπŒªŒØŒ±, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus It is a dispassionate virtuous love, a concept developed by Aristotle. In his best- known work on ethics, Nicomachean Ethics, philia is expressed variously as loyalty to friends (specifically, \\"brotherly love\\"), family, and community, and requires virtue, equality, and familiarity. Furthermore, in the same text philos is also the root of philautia denoting self-love and arising from it, a general type of love, used for love between family, between friends, a desire or enjoyment of an activity, as well as between lovers. *Storge (œÉœÑŒøœÅŒ≥ŒÆ storgƒì) means \\"love, affection\\" and \\"especially of parents and children\\".œÉœÑŒøœÅŒ≥ŒÆ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus It is the common or natural empathy, like that felt by parents for offspring. Rarely used in ancient works, and then almost exclusively as a descriptor of relationships within the family. It is also known to express mere acceptance or putting up with situations, as in \\"loving\\" the tyrant. This is also used when referencing the love for one's country or a favorite sports team. * Philautia () means \\"self-love\\". To love yourself or \\"regard for one's own happiness or advantage\\"[Merriam-Webster dictionary] has both been conceptualized as a basic human necessityMaslow‚Äôs hierarchy of needs and as a moral flaw, akin to vanity and selfishness,B. Kirkpatrick ed., Roget's Thesaurus (1998) p. 592 and p. 639 synonymous with amour-propre or egotism. The Greeks further divided this love into positive and negative: one, the unhealthy version is the self-obsessed love, and the other is the concept of self-compassion. * Xenia (, meaning \\"guest-friendship\\") is the ancient Greek concept of hospitality, the generosity and courtesy shown to those who are far from home and/or associates of the person bestowing guest-friendship. The rituals of hospitality created and expressed a reciprocal relationship between guest and host expressed in both material benefits (such as the giving of gifts to each party) as well as non-material ones (such as protection, shelter, favors, or certain normative rights).

Like Greek Eos and Rigvedic Ushas, Aur≈çra continues the name of an earlier Indo-European dawn goddess, Hausos.  Name  Aur≈çra stems from Proto-Italic *aus≈çs, and ultimately from Proto-Indo- European *h‚Çê√©us≈çs, the \\"dawn\\" conceived as divine entity. It has cognates in the goddesses ƒí·πìs, U·π£as, Au≈°rinƒó, Auseklis and ƒíastre. Roman mythology In Roman mythology, Aur≈çra renews herself every morning and flies across the sky, announcing the arrival of the Sun. Her parentage was flexible: for Ovid, she could equally be Pallantis, signifying the daughter of Pallas,\\"When Pallantis next gleams in heaven and stars flee...\\" (Ovid, Fasti iv. 373. or the daughter of Hyperion.Fasti v.159; also Hyginus, Preface to Fabulae. She has two siblings, a brother (Sol, the Sun) and a sister (Luna, the Moon). Roman writers rarely imitated Hesiod and later Greek poets by naming Aur≈çra as the mother of the Anemoi (the Winds), who were the offspring of Astraeus, the father of the stars. Aur≈çra appears most often in sexual poetry with one of her mortal lovers. A myth taken from the Greek by Roman poets tells that one of her lovers was the prince of Troy, Tithonus. Tithonus was a mortal, and would therefore age and die. Wanting to be with her lover for all eternity, Aur≈çra asked Jupiter to grant immortality to Tithonus. Jupiter granted her wish, but she failed to ask for eternal youth to accompany his immortality, and he became forever old. Aur≈çra turned him into a cicada.

In 2001, they accepted a contract by Amiga Incorporated to develop AmigaOS 4 and mainly discontinued their porting business to pursue this development. AmigaOS 4 runs on the AmigaOne systems, Commodore Amiga systems with a Phase5 PowerUP accelerator board, Pegasos II systems and Sam440/Sam460 systems.  History  Hyperion Entertainment was founded in April 1999 with Ben Hermans and Evert Carton in charge. In their own words, \\"After Belgian lawyer Benjamin Hermans wondered why no one had ever tried to license PC games to do Amiga ports.\\" Hyperion does not maintain programmer staff but sub-contracts software programmers for projects as necessary. Hans-Joerg Frieden, who had previously worked on ports of the games Descent and Abuse as well as the Warp3D library, was contracted to be Hyperion's main developer. For the next few years, Hyperion would port several game titles to the Amiga and later Linux and the Macintosh, starting with Amiga port of Heretic II in 2000. Game development The port of Heretic II was generally well received by the Amiga press, but had weak sales. Following this, Hyperion set out to target a broader range of platforms: Amiga, Linux, and Mac OS. Later in 2000, Hyperion completed the Linux version of SiN. The Amiga port has been postponed due to hardware requirements and ultimately not released. They also approached Monolith Productions to port their Lithtech engine, culminating in their port of Shogo: Mobile Armor Division for Amiga, Linux, and Mac OS in 2001. The game had not sold as well as had been hoped, most notably on Linux, despite becoming a best seller on Tux Games. Hyperion stated that Linux users were likely to dual boot with Windows to play easily available games rather than purchase more expensive specialised versions years after release. In early 2002 Hyperion introduced the Amiga port of Descent: FreeSpace ‚Äì The Great War. An improved version for AmigaOS 4 followed in 2010. After id Software released source code, Hyperion marketed later in 2002 a commercial Amiga port of Quake II. A Linux port of Gorky 17 was developed by Hyperion and published by Linux Game Publishing in 2006, while a version for AmigaOS 4 was released nearly a decade later in 2015. During work on the Heretic II port, Hyperion Entertainment developers created an OpenGL subset called MiniGL which sits on top of Warp3D to ease porting of 3D games. The MiniGL library was released for free use to other software developers.  AmigaOS 4  In 2001 Hyperion announced that, after licensing the rights from Amiga, Inc, it would be working on the long-awaited successor to AmigaOS 3.9, and to this end concentrated most of its effort on the development of AmigaOS 4. Hyperion claimed and still claim that it is based upon AmigaOS 3.1 source code, and to a lesser extent certain AmigaOS 3.9 sources. A quick port of 68k AmigaOS to PowerPC was originally planned, with new features added as development continued. Ben Hermans, writing on Amiga forum Ann.lu, claimed that these sources, along with the source of the PPC kernel WarpOS would be sufficient to provide a version to users within a year, making his now-infamous \\"change some flags and recompile\\" comment. AmigaOS 4.0 was first released to end-users and second level betatesters in April 2004, with AmigaOS 4.1 following in September 2008. It is currently still in development. In 2004, Hyperion attempted to obtain a licence for an AmigaOS 4 native port of the file manager Directory Opus, which had originally and been developed on the Amiga, but for which development had since moved to the Microsoft Windows platform. However talks between Hyperion and GP Software broke down. The first managing partner of Hyperion, Benjamin Hermans, in the period between announcement and release of AmigaOS 4, ignited a great deal of community controversy by repeatedly claiming that MorphOS, an AmigaOS-like competitor (which had been released in complete form in 2003), was illegal, and had on several occasions threatened to take legal action against it either on the grounds that it was parasitic competition to AmigaOS 4, or even that it was actually based on stolen AmigaOS source code. No evidence to support either claim ever became public, neither did any legal action against MorphOS take place, although neither prevented such views being repeated commonly in public Amiga forums and mailing lists and even accepted as fact by some. This situation was inflamed by ex-Commodore engineer Dave Haynie, who backed up Herman's claims: \\"If you have seen the Amiga source code, you cannot produce a legally separate work-alike\\", though again without any direct evidence. The dispute did not enter the courts, but in the forums the argument was bitter. Hermans claimed that Bill Buck, who lead the Genesi company funding MorphOS, was a \\"con-artist\\". Evert Carton took over the managing partner position after Hermans stepped down in 2003, due to lack of time for daily administrative work. Timothy de Groote became another partner in 2003.  Dispute and settlement with Amiga, Inc.  In 2007, Hyperion was sued by Amiga Incorporated for trademark infringement in the Washington Western District Court in Seattle, Washington. Amiga, Inc. sued Hyperion for breach of contract, trademark violation and copyright infringement concerning the development and marketing of AmigaOS 4.0, stating that Hyperion had continued to develop and market AmigaOS 4 without paying agreed royalties and had continued to do so even after being warned to cease and desist. Hyperion launched a counter action, claiming fraud in the Amiga, Inc. handling of Amiga intellectual properties and debts, including the use of debt-holding shell companies, by shifting responsibility between these shell companies. They also claimed that Amiga, Inc. had failed to uphold their part of the contract and had been untruthful in correspondence; and that they had failed to deliver the AmigaOS 3.1 source that AmigaOS 4 was developed from, forcing Hyperion to find it elsewhere. In spite of that ongoing legal dispute, in autumn 2007, Hyperion released a standalone version of AmigaOS 4 for classic Amiga, an action Amiga, Inc. claimed as illegal. On 29 May 2007, the new managing partner stated under oath - without further evidence - that the open-source AmigaOS reimplementation AROS was \\"probably illegal\\", as documented on page 27 of court documents related to the Amiga-Hyperion court case. On 30 September 2009, Hyperion and Amiga, Inc reached a settlement. Hyperion was granted an exclusive license to develop and market AmigaOS 4 and subsequent versions with the name AmigaOS. However, the \\"Amiga\\" trademark remained with Amiga, Inc. and was then also licensed to other parties, including Commodore USA and iContain. This meant that \\"Amiga\\" branded hardware could and would be sold without AmigaOS 4. In 2009, Hyperion changed its legal status from a business partnership (VOF) to a company with limited liability (CVBA). On 24 April 2011, Evert Carton announced he was stepping down as the managing partner of Hyperion. In charge of the company were then Ben Hermans and Timothy de Groote. Insolvency Declaration of 2015 On 27 January 2015, Hyperion Entertainment was declared insolvent. Ben Hermans has claimed that this was an administrative mistake by a third party and that the company would appeal the insolvency decision. The declaration was overturned on 2 April 2015 and the company posted a clarification on its website.  Recent events  AmigaOS 4 developer and Aminet administrator Costel Mincea joined Hyperion in mid 2015 as a third director. Hyperion reported in January 2017 that Hermans has resigned as a director, in charge of the company remained Timothy De Groote and Costel Mincea. In October 2017 Hyperion was removed from Belgium's official company register due to not filling annual reports for the last three years. Hyperion remedied this by supplying required reports to the National Bank of Belgium. In July 2020 Amiga-news.de reported Costel Mincea resigned from his post at Hyperion and remaining director Timothy de Groote was in a legal dispute with former Hyperion's managing partner Ben Hermans.  Games  Hyperion's game ports include these: Heretic II, Shogo: Mobile Armor Division, Gorky 17, Quake II, SiN and Descent: FreeSpace ‚Äì The Great War. Hyperion also announced that it acquired the license to port Worms Armageddon and Soldier of Fortune, but these were not released.

Richardson in the 1870s. He was the fourth Architect of the Capitol and responsible for adding the north (Senate) and south (House) wings and the central dome that is predominately the current appearance of the U.S. Capitol building. Walter was one of the founders and second president of the American Institute of Architects. Early life Born in 1804 in Philadelphia, Walter was the son of mason and bricklayer Joseph S. Walter and his wife Deborah. Walter was a mason's apprentice to his father. He also studied architecture and technical drawing at the Franklin Institute. Walter received early training in a variety of fields including masonry, mathematics, physical science, and the fine arts. At 15, Walter entered the office of William Strickland, studying architecture and mechanical drawing, then established his own practice in 1830. Works Girard College, Philadelphia Walter was commissioned by Spruce Street Baptist Church to design its new building at 418 Spruce Street in Philadelphia. The 1829 building is today home to the Society Hill Synagogue. Walter's first major commission was Moyamensing Prison, the Philadelphia County Prison. Designed as a humane model in its time, the prison was built between 1832 and 1835. Walter also designed the First Presbyterian Church of West Chester, which opened its doors in January 1834. In March 1834, the Walter-designed Wills Eye Hospital opened on the southwest corner of 18th and Race Streets in Philadelphia (on Logan Square). He first came to national recognition for his design of Girard College for Orphans (1833‚Äì1848) in Philadelphia, among the last and grandest expressions of the Greek Revival movement. Walter designed mansions, banks, churches, the hotel at Brandywine Springs, and courthouses. In 1836, he designed the Bank of Chester County at West Chester, Pennsylvania. In 1845, he was commissioned a decade later, he designed the 1846 Chester County Courthouse in Greek Revival style.dsf.chesco.org - Chester county courthouse West Chester, Pennsylvania He designed the St. James Episcopal Church (Wilmington, North Carolina) which opened in 1840. In Lexington, Virginia, he designed the Lexington Presbyterian Church in 1843. The same year he designed the Chapel of the Cross in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. In Norfolk, Virginia, he designed the Norfolk Academy in 1840. and Accompanying photo The Tabb Street Presbyterian Church was erected at Petersburg, Virginia in 1843. It has also been suggested that Walter designed the Second Empire-styled Quarters B and Quarters D at Admiral's Row in Brooklyn, New York. Among the notable residences designed by Walter were his own home, located at High and Morton Streets in the Germantown section of Philadelphia, the Nicholas Biddle estate Andalusia; Inglewood Cottage; and St. George's Hall, residence of Matthew Newkirk, president of the Philadelphia, Wilmington & Baltimore Railroad (PW&B;). Walter also designed the Garrett-Dunn House in Philadelphia's Mt. Airy neighborhood, which was destroyed by fire after being struck by lightning in 2009. Among his smaller designs was the 1839 Newkirk Viaduct Monument, commissioned by the PW&B; to mark the completion of the first rail line south from Philadelphia. The U.S. Capitol and its dome Inauguration of Abraham Lincoln, March 4, 1861, beneath the unfinished capitol dome The most famous of Walter's constructions is the dome of the U.S. Capitol. By 1850, the rapid expansion of the United States had caused a space shortage in the Capitol. Walter was selected to design extensions for the Capitol. His plan more than doubled the size of the existing building and added the familiar cast-iron dome. There were at least six draftsmen in Walter's office, headed by Walter's chief assistant, August Schoenborn, a German immigrant who had learned his profession from the ground up. It appears that he was responsible for some of the fundamental ideas in the Capitol structure. These included the curved arch ribs and an ingenious arrangement used to cantilever the base of the columns. This made it appear that the diameter of the base exceeded the actual diameter of the foundation, thereby enlarging the proportions of the total structure. Walter family with servant, circa 1850 Construction on the wings began in 1851 and proceeded rapidly; the House of Representatives met in its new quarters in December 1857 and the Senate occupied its new chamber by January 1859. Walter's fireproof cast iron dome was authorized by Congress on March 3, 1855, and was nearly completed by December 2, 1863, when the Statue of Freedom was placed on top. He also reconstructed the interior of the west center building for the Library of Congress after the fire of 1851. Walter continued as Capitol architect until 1865, when he resigned his position over a minor contract dispute. After 14 years in Washington, he retired to his native Philadelphia. In the 1870s, financial setbacks forced him to come out of retirement, and he worked as second-in-command when his friend and younger colleague John McArthur, Jr. won the competition for Philadelphia City Hall. He continued on that vast project until his death in 1887. He was interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.Laurel Hill Cemetery Other honors For their architectural accomplishments, both Walter and Benjamin Latrobe are honored in a ceiling mosaic in the East Mosaic Corridor at the entrance to the Main Reading Room of the Library of Congress.

The series was eventually collected as the trade paperback Squee's Wonderful Big Giant Book of Unspeakable Horrors. Overview The series focuses on a young boy named Todd Casil, otherwise known as Squee. An introverted and bullied little kid with a less than supportive family, Squee has been forced to mature a bit more quickly than his peers. He is fond of writing, but only receives criticism from his teacher and taunting from his classmates. Any attempts he makes to deflect these hostilities only results in being shoved into the dirt or otherwise further humiliated. Squee's mother is addicted to some form of pill and spends a lot of time lying around in a nearly incoherent state. She often forgets who Squee is, or that she even has a child. His father, painfully aware of Squee's existence, loathes the boy and never forgets to mention that he blames Squee for \\"ruining\\" his life, claiming that he \\"hasn't smiled once since [Squee] was born\\". Having little patience for anything Squee says or does, he eventually becomes convinced that Squee is mentally unstable, and by the end of the series, has him committed to the \\"Defective Head Meat Institute\\". Squee also has a grandfather who justifiably believes his children are only waiting for him to die to collect some kind of inheritance. His grandfather claims to keep healthy and young by consuming his children's first-borns, and subsequently attempts to devour Squee, only to reveal in horrifying fashion that he is in fact a cyborg and quite possibly insane. Squee's next door neighbor is Johnny C., also known as \\"Nny\\" (pronounced \\"knee\\"), the main character of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac (abbreviated JtHM). Nny regularly visits Squee late at night by breaking into his room. Johnny the Homicidal Maniac focused more on the \\"mentoring\\" or \\"big brother\\" aspect of Nny and Squee's relationship, but little interaction occurs in Squee!, aside from the occasional drawing or note left in Squee's room, or short references to \\"the crazy neighbor man\\" (he does appear as an out-patient of \\"Defective Head Meat Institute\\", who Squee is oddly pleased to see). Squee has only one friend, albeit a possibly imaginary one, the dilapidated teddy bear affectionately referred to as Shmee. Only one real person makes any attempt to befriend Squee, a boy named Pepito who happens to be the Antichrist. During the course of the series, Squee encounters a killer chihuahua (that fatally mauls the only classmate who was friendly to him), zombified classmates, sporting mishaps, alien abductions, near recruitment into Satan's army, an encounter with his future self, a ghostly visitor, a giant murderous dust mite and eventual committal to a mental institution despite being one of the most sane characters in the comic. These experiences lead him to remark to a \\"lamb-baby-dog-thing\\" in one strip that some bitter cartoonist must be drawing his life and therefore he doesn't want to get too attached to anyone or anything in it. Other notable characters in the series Pepito A scene in JtHM #4 includes an early appearance of Pepito. This early, slightly different design of Pepito can be seen holding the hand of his mother in the panel in which Devi recalls the day she saw Nny at the bookstore. He also appears, in this same form, in the nightmare Squee has after Johnny leaves his room at the end of JtHM #7. Pepito is a new classmate of Squee's who happens to be the Antichrist. Squee secretly agrees with Pepito's apocalyptic rantings, but isn't quite sure those who have taunted or hurt him in his life really deserve to be punished. After inviting Squee over for dinner one night, Pepito professes his boredom with the human world, and complains to his father, Satan, that he has no one to play with in this \\"infernal inferno\\". This prompts Satan to try and recruit Squee into his dark army by using a metaphor involving breadsticks and nachos, among other things, basically implying that Squee's life will be better overall if he would simply give up his soul. Squee politely declines Satan's offer and the subject is immediately and permanently dropped. Despite this, Pepito still considers Squee and himself friends. Shmee Squee carries around with him a dilapidated teddy bear he has named Shmee. Often, Squee talks to Shmee like a real person, confiding in the stuffed toy, who apparently responds though no readable dialogue is ever exchanged between the two, save one strip in which Squee has a conversation with Shmee in his dreams. Shmee claims to be a \\"trauma sponge\\", soaking up all the negative feelings and experiences and storing them inside himself for Squee. He says this will prevent Squee from becoming like Johnny C. During the silent exchanges they share on various occasions, Shmee often suggests that Squee do something violent, like arson in retaliation for some wrong committed against him. Squee laughs these suggestions off, assuming that Shmee is joking, though to the reader it is fairly obvious that he is not. Synopsis The story is told episodically with little continuity from issue to issue. Issue 1 The series begins with Squee in bed praying for his father to be happy, when he notices that his teddy bear, Shmee is not in bed where he should be, he finds him in the closet where two aliens are waiting to abduct Squee for experiments. Another pair of aliens, who are notably more intelligent than the first pair, show up, and the aliens all argue over who should get to take Squee back with them and perform their tests on him, until the second pair tricks the others and take Squee for themselves. Squee later returns home just in time to go to school the next morning. On the way he sees his only friend get attacked by a small dog after his lunch, who proceeds to drag him into his dog house where he is assumed killed. At school, a new kid named Pepito joins the class, and claims to be the antichrist. Pepito is immediately disgusted by everyone in the class except for Squee who he knows feels the same way as him about the others. Pepito violently attacks the other schoolchildren and decimates the school, until the teacher excuses class for the day. Issue 2 During a family drive, Squee is dropped off at a restaurant to use the restroom. While at the urinal, Squee hears a man in the stall groaning and screaming. As the noise becomes louder and louder, Squee becomes more nervous, until a pool of blood flows out from under the stall and Squee runs out in terror. Later, a man dressed in a large Squee costume appears to Squee on the roof, and claims to be his future self, but before he can say anything noteworthy, the ravages of unperfected time-travel techniques liquefy his spine. That night, Squee dreams he's having a conversation with Shmee, who tells him the nature of his existence, that he acts as a \\"trauma-sponge\\" for Squee, soaking up all the bad things that happen to him. Grandpa comes for a visit the next day, and attempts to eat Squee to gain vitality. This issue was created entirely with a paint brush, instead of Vasquez's usual pen and ink technique. Issue 3 Squee becomes paranoid that dust mites are everywhere, when a large one falls out of his pillow. Angry at being disturbed, he attempts to kill Squee. Squee is woken up in the night by the ghost of a dead girl who died in his room. At school Squee meets a dog who appears to want to be his friend, but Squee realizes that terrible things happen to anyone around him and so attempts to keep the dog away (Soon after that, the dog was hit by a car) After school Squee is invited to dinner at Pepito's house where he meets his Pepito's father, Satan (otherwise known as Se√±or Diablo who also appeared in the sixth issue of JtHM) who attempts to recruit him to his Soulless Army of Darkness. Issue 4 Squee is once again approached by the first pair of aliens who attempted to abduct him in issue 1, this time he manages to convince them that it would be smarter for them to take his parents, which they agree to. At school, Squee is bullied by a group of kids and then laughed at by a girl who is then hit with a baseball, causing her eye to pop out and Squee to run away screaming. In class, Squee questions a textbook typo which angers his teacher into ordering the other students to attack him. Squee realizes that his classmates have been turned into zombies by the administration so that they will unquestionably follow the teacher's commands. Squee is saved by Pepito who proceeds to destroy the whole school. At home, Squee's parents return from their abduction and decide to bring Squee to a mental institution, where he is briefly reunited with Johnny C. who is there as a volunteer for sleep study. References to Vasquez's own life While Johnny the Homicidal Maniac was more about things that angered Vasquez, Squee! was about things that terrified him as a child. Many of Squee's fears (such as aliens and the monster under the bed) were fears of Vasquez's. He stated at the 2006 New York Comic Con that the scene where the chihuahua mauls Squee's friend was based on a similar thing that happened to him. Animated short In 2013, it was revealed that Jhonen Vasquez is working on an animated short based on Squee!. It will be called \\"Squee Versus the Labyrinth of Meat\\".

It records a large number of events and laws that are endorsed or proscribed by the God of Israel. Judaism teaches that the Torah contains 613 commandments, many of which deal with crime and punishment, but only the Noahide Laws apply to humanity in general. Most Christian denominations have also adopted some of these directives, such as the Ten Commandments and Great Commandment, while a minority believes all Old Covenant laws have been abrogated. In the Book of Exodus Moses negotiated the Exodus from Egypt with Pharaoh leading to the Ten plagues. When Pharaoh enslaved the Children of Israel, the Egyptians appointed conscription officers over the Israelites to crush their spirits with hard labor. The Israelites were to build up the cities of Pithom and Ra'amses as supply centers for Pharaoh. They made the lives of the Israelites miserable with harsh labor involving mortar and bricks, as well as all kinds of work in the field. Exodus 1:11-14 Then he issued decrees to kill all the Israelite males.Exodus 1:15-16 God hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not allow the Hebrews to leave, and then God sent various disasters onto the whole of Egypt. Exodus includes the story of the killing of every firstborn child in Egypt as the final punishment for having enslaved the Israelites.Exodus 6-14  The Midianites  In Numbers 25, the people of Midian together with Moab began to interact with the people of Israel, who were staying in Shittim. At this time, Israelite men began to have sexual relations with Moabite women. After being invited by Moabite women, some Israelite men participated in eating sacrificial meals and worshipping Moabite deities. The then ordered a daylight execution of all those that had fornicated and worshipped with the Moabites. While the Israelites were still assembled in mourning after the execution, an Israelite man, Zimri the son of Salu, publicly brought a Midianite woman, Cozbi daughter of Zur, into his tent. Phinehas, a grandson of Aaron, left the assembly, went inside the tent, and drove a javelin through both Zimri and Cozbi. Because of Phinehas' act, the 's wrath was turned away from the children of Israel. The then ordered Moses to attack the Midianites for plotting against the Israelites in the matters of Peor and Cozbi.Numbers 25:1-18 After an army of 12,000 (1000 from each tribe) was sent against the Midianites, Moses was angry when the army returned with captive women and other spoils, because the women had played vital roles in the previous trespasses and consequent plague.Num 31:1-16 Moses then ordered all males and non-virgin females killed, and all female virgins preserved.Num 31:17,18 One of every five hundred remaining captives of the soldiers' plunder was to be put in service as tribute to the under Eleazar the priest (Numbers 31:28) as \\"heave offerings\\", thanksgiving for success.Num 31:32-35 Out of the booty that belonged to Israelites, one of every fifty was set apart to the Levites who cared for the Tabernacle.

Centuries later, in the days of Moses, this practice was formulated into a law of a Levirate marriage, where the brother of the deceased would provide offspring to the childless widow ) to preserve the family line.Dancy, J.

Numbers 35:31). \\"It must be noted that the death penalty might also indicate the seriousness of the crime without calling for the actual implementation of it in every case. In fact, there is little evidence that many of these sanctions were ever actually carried out in ancient Israel. Only in the case of premeditated murder was there the added stricture of 'Do not accept a ransom for the life of the murderer who deserves to die' (Num 35:31). . . . Traditional wisdom, both in the Jewish and Christian communities, interpreted this verse in Numbers 35:31 to mean that out of the almost twenty cases calling for capital punishment in the Old Testament, every one of them could have the sanction commuted by an appropriate substitute of money or anything that showed the seriousness of the crime, but in the case of what we today call first-degree murder, there was never to be offered or accepted any substitute or bargaining of any kind: the offender had to pay with his or her life\\".Walter Kaiser Jr., Peter H.

It started as a proprietary PC variant intended for multimedia applications and PC games, but later became more compatible with IBM PC compatibles. In 1993, the FM Towns Marty was released, a game console compatible with existing FM Towns games. The \\"FM\\" part of the name means \\"Fujitsu Micro\\" like their earlier products, while the \\"Towns\\" part is derived from the code name the system was assigned while in development, \\"Townes\\". This refers to Charles Townes, one of the winners of the 1964 Nobel Prize in Physics, following a custom of Fujitsu at the time to code name PC products after Nobel Prize winners. The e in \\"Townes\\" was dropped when the system went into production to make it clearer that the term was to be pronounced like the word \\"towns\\" rather than the potential \\"tow-nes\\". History Fujitsu decided to release a new home computer after the FM-7 was technologically overcome by NEC's PC-8801. During the life of the FM-7, Fujitsu had learned that software sales drove hardware sales, and in order to acquire usable software quickly, the new computer was to be based on Fujitsu's \\"FMR50\\" system architecture. The FMR50 system, released at 1986, was another x86/DOS-based computer similar to NEC's popular PC-9801. The FMR50 computers were sold with moderate success in Japanese offices, particularly in Japanese government offices. There were hundreds of software packages available for the FMR, including Lotus 1-2-3, WordStar, Multiplan, and dBASE III. With this basis of compatibility, the more multimedia-friendly FM Towns was created. NEC's PC-9801 computers were widespread and dominated in the 1980s, at one point reaching 70% of the 16/32-bit computer market. However, they have poor graphics (640√ó400 with 16 of 4096 colors) and sounds (4-operator/3 voice monaural FM sounds). Just as Commodore saw an opening for the Amiga in some global markets against the IBM PC, a computer with improved graphics and sound was considered to overcome the PC-9801 in the home-use field in Japan. With many multimedia innovations for its time, the FM Towns was that system, though for a number of reasons it never broke far beyond the boundaries of its niche market status. Eventually the FM Towns lost much of its uniqueness by adding a DOS/V (PC clone plus DOS with native Japanese language support) compatibility mode switch, until Fujitsu finally discontinued making FM Towns specific hardware and software and moved to focus on the IBM PC clones (Fujitsu FMV) that many Japanese manufacturers--who previously were not players in the PC market--were building by the mid to late 1990s. To this day, Fujitsu is known for its laptop PCs globally, and FM Towns (and Marty) users have been relegated to a small community of aficionados. Overview Several variants were built; the first system (FM TOWNS model1 and model2) is based on an Intel 80386DX processor running at a clock speed of 16 MHz, with the option of adding an 80387 FPU, features one or two megabytes of RAM (with a possible maximum of 6 MB), one or two 3.5\\" floppy disk drives, a PCMCIA memory card slot and a single-speed CD- ROM drive. Its package includes a gamepad, a mouse and a microphone. The earlier, more distinctive models featuring a vertical CD-ROM tray on the front of the case (model1, model2, 1F, 2F, 1H, 2H, 10F and 20F) were often referred to as the \\"Gray\\" Towns, and were the ones most directly associated with the \\"FM Towns\\" brand. Most featured 3 memory expansion slots and used 72-pin non- parity SIMMs with a required timing of 100ns or less and a recommended timing of 60ns. Hard drives are not standard equipment, and are not required for most uses. The OS is loaded from CD-ROM by default. A SCSI Centronics 50/SCSI-1/Full-Pitch port is provided for connecting external SCSI disk drives, and is the most common way to connect a hard drive to an FM Towns PC. Although internal drives are rare, there is a hidden compartment with a SCSI 50-pin connector where a hard drive may be connected, however the power supply module does not typically provide the required Molex connector to power the drive. The video output is 15 kHz RGB (though some programs used a 31 kHz mode) using the same DB15 connector and pinouts as the PC-9801. Operating system The operating system used is Windows 3.0/3.1/95 and a graphical OS called Towns OS, based on MS-DOS and the Phar Lap DOS extender (RUN386.EXE). Most games for the system were written in protected mode Assembly and C using the Phar Lap DOS extender. These games usually utilize the Towns OS API (TBIOS) for handling several graphic modes, sprites, sounds, a mouse, gamepads, and CD-audio. The FM Towns is capable of booting its graphical Towns OS straight from CD in 1989 - two years before Amiga CDTV booted its GUI-based AmigaOS 1.3 from internal CD drive and the CD-bootable System 7 was released for the Macintosh in 1991, and five years before the El Torito specification standardized boot-CDs on IBM PC compatibles in 1994. To boot the system from CD-ROM, the FM TOWNS has a \\"hidden C:\\" ROM drive in which a minimum MS-DOS system, CD-ROM driver and MSCDEX.EXE are installed. This minimal DOS system runs first, and the DOS system reads and executes the Towns OS IPL stored in CD-ROM after that. The Towns OS CD-ROM has an IPL, MS-DOS system (IO.SYS), DOS extender, and Towns API (TBIOS). A minimal DOS system that allows the CD-ROM drive to be accessed is contained in a system ROM; this, coupled with Fujitsu's decision to charge only a minimal license fee for the inclusion of a bare-bones Towns OS on game CD-ROMs, allows game developers to make games bootable directly from CD-ROM without the need for a boot floppy or hard disk. Various Linux and BSD distributions have also been ported to the FM Towns system, including Debian and Gentoo.Linux / TOWNS Information Memo 2nd EditionTOWNS + Linux = Ôº≥Ôº®Ôºµ's homepage A version of GNU called GNU for FM Towns was released in 1990. Graphics The FM Towns features video modes ranging from 320√ó200 to 720√ó512 resolutions, with 16 to 32,768 simultaneous colors out of a possible 4096 to 16 million (depending on the video mode); most of these video modes have two memory pages, and it allows the use of up to 1024 sprites of 16√ó16 pixels each. It also has a built-in font ROM for the display of kanji characters. The system has the ability to overlay different video modes; for example, the 320√ó200 video mode with 32,768 colors can be overlaid with a 640√ó480 mode using 16 colors, which allows games to combine high-color graphics with high-resolution kanji text. It uses 640 KB of video RAM, including 512 KB VRAM and 128 KB sprite RAM. Sprite layer: * Resolution: 256√ó240 pixels * Colors: 256 on screen out of 32,768 palette * Sprite RAM: 128 KB (8 KB attributes, 120 KB pattern/colour data) * Maximum sprite count: Up to 1024 on screen * Sprite size: 16√ó16 pixels * Colors per sprite: 16FM Towns video hardware - MAME source * Overlay support: Bitmap modes 1-11 Up to two graphical layers can be overlaid, whether it is two bitmap layers, or the sprite layer with a bitmap background layer. The latter is useful for action games, though the sprite function is not as advanced as that of rival 16-bit computer, the Sharp X68000. When the sprite layer is used, it is rendered to VRAM layer 1 on top, with the bitmap background as VRAM layer 0 below. When two bitmap layers are used, then both are rendered to VRAM layers 0 and 1.

The system has ports in the front to accommodate karaoke, LEDs to indicate volume level, and software to add popular voice-altering effects such as echoes. The Ricoh RF5c68 is an eight-channel sound chip developed by Ricoh. It is notably used in the FM Towns computer system, along with Sega's System 18 and System 32 arcade game system boards. The RF5c68 supports eight 8-bit PCM channels, with 19.6 kHz or variable sampling rate. Audio bit depth ranges from 8-bit to 10-bit.Ricoh RF5C68 PCM controller - MAME source Games on the FM Towns regularly use Red Book (audio CD standard) orchestral music tracks, especially if they are designed specifically for the Fujitsu system. Games ported from the PC9801, for instance, might have used only PCM/FM music. This was a novelty and innovation far ahead of other PCs of the time made possible by the standard CD-ROM drive in every FM Towns computer.

The character first appeared in Strange Tales #126 (November 1964), and was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. Debuting in the Silver Age of Comic Books, Dormammu has appeared in six decades of Marvel publications, featuring prominently in the Doctor Strange titles and limited series as a recurring enemy of the mystic hero. The character has also appeared in associated Marvel merchandise including films, animated television series, toys, trading cards, and video games. In 2009, Dormammu was ranked as IGN's 56th-greatest comic book villain of all time.Dormammu is number 56 IGN. Retrieved 10-05-09. The character made his film debut in the 2016 Marvel Cinematic Universe film Doctor Strange, performed through motion capture by Benedict Cumberbatch and voiced by a mixture of Cumberbatch and an unidentified British actor. Publication history  Origin  Dormammu first appeared in Strange Tales #126‚Äì127 (November‚ÄìDecember 1964), but had been mentioned previously in dialog, along with his realm the \\"Dark Dimension\\". Writer Mike Conroy said: After being established as the ruler of an alternate dimension (later described as the god-tyrant of its denizens),Excalibur (Vol 3) #14 (2005). Marvel Comics (New York). Dormammu became a perennial foe of Sorcerer Supreme Doctor Strange, who until this time had dealt almost exclusively with off-beat \\"one-off\\" mystical threats in Strange Tales #110‚Äì125 (July 1963 ‚Äì October 1964). Strange's first encounter with Dormammu in the \\"Dark Dimension\\" also introduced Clea, eventually revealed to be the niece of the villain (like Clea's name, this was not initially revealed in Strange Tales #126; November 1964), and the monstrous and imprisoned Mindless Ones. The character's major appearances include starring in an epic fifteen issue storyline in Strange Tales #131‚Äì146 (April 1965 ‚Äì July 1966); the discovery that Dormammu has a sister, Umar, and both are in fact mystical beings called Faltine in Strange Tales #150 (November 1966); teaming with fellow villain Loki to instigate the \\"Avengers-Defenders War\\" in The Avengers #115‚Äì118 (September‚ÄìDecember 1973) and Defenders #8‚Äì11 (September‚ÄìDecember 1973); Thor Annual #9 (1981); Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme #1‚Äì2 (November 1988 & January 1989) and the limited series Doctor Strange: The Flight of the Bones #1‚Äì4 (February‚ÄìMay 1999) and Hellcat #1‚Äì3 (September‚ÄìNovember 2000). After a major appearance in The Amazing Spider-Man #498‚Äì500 (October‚ÄìDecember 2003), Dormammu became the patron of small-time villain the Hood in The New Avengers #46 (December 2008).  Fictional character biography   1960s  Dormammu is first mentioned by Karl Amadeus Mordo, senior apprentice of the appointed \\"Sorcerer Supreme\\" the \\"Ancient One\\", who, in the entity's service, attempts to slowly weaken the sorcerer, but is stopped when his fellow pupil Stephen Strange alerts his master to the betrayal. The character later appears in person when sending a messenger to boast his renewed intentions of conquering his universe before his aging adversary. In response, Doctor Strange travels to Dormammu's \\"Dark Dimension\\" as the Ancient One does not consider himself powerful enough to defeat Dormammu, and manages to overcome all supernatural servitors sent against him. Dormammu engages Strange in mystic combat and shows himself to be far more powerful, but, when drawing upon the realm's energies, inadvertently weakens the barrier containing the horde of Mindless Ones. Since they threatened Dormammu's subjects, Strange helped his enemy to re-seal the juggernauts by letting power from his amulet flow into Dormammu. Indebted to Strange for his help, Dormammu ends the fight, and in return Strange demands a binding vow to never enter the \\"Earth realm\\" again and to not harm Clea. Dormammu complies, but gains a burning hatred against Strange for the humiliation. Dormammu uses a loophole to his oath by granting Mordo vast power, whereupon the sorcerer leads his minions on a lengthy hunt for Strange, and abduct the Ancient One as a bargaining chip. Dormammu's niece, Clea, assists Strange by weakening the barrier of the Mindless Ones, forcing her uncle to focus elsewhere. Dormammu learns of her betrayal, brings all three Earth sorcerers to a neutral realm, to let her see his disciple destroy Strange, and summons fellow \\"Lords of the Netherworlds\\" to watch the spectacle. When Strange begins to get an advantage against Mordo, Dormammu decides to face the sorcerer in a contest of pure hand-to-hand-combat. The physically stronger entity eventually falls to his foe's greater familiarity with martial arts. To Dormammu's humiliation, before the gathered Lords, Strange forces him to vow not to menace the Earth even by proxy. The villain strikes a parting blow by banishing Clea, and inciting another lord to attack Strange. In an apparent bid for power the character engages the universal embodiment, Eternity, in single combat, but is defeated and banished. Dormammu captures Clea, and overpowers and imprisons Strange. The sorcerer manipulates Umar into freeing him, and then surprises Dormammu by pushing him through a portal to the Earth. This makes the entity wither from the curse cast by his own power, when vowing to never enter the Earth realm, and he departs to his own plane. 1970s Dormammu enters into an alliance with the Asgardian Loki and tricks superhero teams the Avengers and Defenders into fighting each other for components of the artifact known as the Evil Eye. The Eye is reassembled, and allows Dormammu to merge his own universe with all the planets of the \\"regular\\" Marvel Universe without breaking his vow. Dormammu imprisons the traitorous Loki and effortlessly overwhelms all of his other opponents, leaving only the Scarlet Witch. When Loki escapes and distracts Dormammu, the Scarlet Witch casts a hex on the Eye that causes it to absorb Dormammu, and costs Loki his sanity.\\"Avengers/Defenders War\\" from: After being seen in flashback, the character manages to reintegrate himself on Earth, but is recovering slowly to full strength. Together with Umar, Dormammu captures the elder goddess Gaea, and seeks revenge against the Scarlet Witch by kidnapping her and her mentor, Agatha Harkness, from her wedding to the Vision. After Wanda and Agatha remove the heat needed for his regeneration, he departs for his own realm. Immediately afterwards, he attempts to destroy Doctor Strange and Clea. He is betrayed by Umar, who steals his power and allows the character to be banished from Earth. Dormammu tricks Strange into battling both the demon Ghost Rider and the Bounty Hunter in an unsuccessful attempt to kill Strange. Dormammu appears in a \\"What If...?\\" alternate universe story as Strange's master in that reality. 1980s Dormammu acts as the envoy of Lord Chaos and plays against Odin in a cosmic chess match whose outcome decides the universal balance of chaos and order. Umar attempts to rig the game in her brother's favor by manipulating Odin's son Thor unsuccessfully, and the game ends in a draw. Dormammu's agent Baron Mordo travels back in time to London in the year 1943, where he allies with the aristocrats Viscount Krowler and Sir Anthony Baskerville. Dormammu possesses Krowler, and begins to manifest on the Earth plane by absorbing power from the destruction of World War II, but he is banished by Doctor Strange.Doctor Strange vol. 2, #49‚Äì51 (1981‚Äì1982) The character reappears during the \\"Inferno\\" storyline. Strange, following an arduous confrontation with Shuma- Gorath, heals through a process that takes him through various mystical realms. This allows Dormammu to attach himself to his foe, and possess the sorcerer's body, which exempts him from the vow to not directly enter the Earth-realm. Summoning extraterrestrial sorcerers as his lieutenants, Dormammu vows to \\"burn\\" and replace the Celestials as the greatest power in the Earth's universe, but is distracted and tricked by Clea and Strange (his consciousness occupying a rat), while their ally Topaz exorcises Dormammu's presence. 1990s The character reconstitutes again, regains control of the Dark Dimension from Clea by subverting her will, and summons her parents, Umar and Orini, from exile. Umar and Baron Mordo join forces with Clea and Doctor Strange. The enraged Dormammu threatens to completely destroy the \\"Dark Dimension\\" in retaliation, but Umar convinces him to accept a compromise as the ruler of a sub-realm, whereas his sister takes over rulership from Clea, with Mordo as her consort. Clea agrees to abdicate rather than see all of her people killed, but promises to return if Umar becomes a tyrant again. Dormammu finds that he has been tricked into becoming the ruler of the realm of the Mindless Ones. After two brief appearances, Dormammu, in the guise of another of the Faltine, manipulates Clea into recruiting allies from the Lords of the Netherworlds to depose her mother. This frees Dormammu to reclaim his realm. He absorbs Umar and Mordo into himself, becoming more powerful than ever before, and he disintegrates the assembled entities. Strange, at the time weakened without support from the \\"Principalities\\", confronts Dormammu with his allies Clea, the Silver Surfer, Hulk, and Ghost Rider, but they are unable to cause any injury to the villain. Strange journeys into the core of Dormammu's essence and uses the Eye of Agamotto to strip away his self- delusion, and make him acknowledge that his thirst for chaos, power, and conquest are unworthy of a being of his stature. Dormammu is momentarily shaken, and appears to be defeated, but this is only a mirage. The villain gloats that he has not shown \\"one tenth\\" of his true power against the heroes, but that he now realizes that rulership of \\"one puny\\" universe is beneath his notice, as he now has far greater and \\"more interesting\\" ambitions, and contemptuously dismisses the \\"insignificant mortals\\". The character observes the Guardians of the Galaxy‚Äîadventurers from the 31st century of Earth-691‚Äîtravel to the mainstream era of Earth-616. Dormammu follows them back to their dimension, merges with his counterpart in this timeline, doubling his power, and attacks their headquarters, demanding the presence of the Doctor Strange of their time. Strange, now called the Ancient One, arrives with his disciple, the alien Krugarr, and battles Dormammu, assisted by the Guardians, the \\"Galactic Guardians\\", and the Phoenix Force. Dormammu kills the elderly Strange, and almost overwhelms his other foes, but is defeated when Krugarr summons the spirit of Strange, and they channel the combined power of everyone in the assembly to banish Dormammu to his home dimension. Dormammu appears as the guiding force behind an attack on the self-titled Goddess during \\"The Infinity Crusade\\" storyline. During The Flight of the Bones storyline the character is revealed as the instigator behind a series of spontaneous combustions of criminals and an attack on an ally of Strange by cultists. 2000s Dormammu uses the demon lord Satannish (revealed as his creation) and warlock Nicholas Scratch to lead his armies to capture five of the inter-dimensional places of Hell, in a plot to eventually conquer all life and afterlife. Dormammu, however, is thwarted when the heroine Hellcat rallies the powers of Hell to weaken the character by engineering a complete absence of mystic flame. Dormammu also allies with the entity Mephisto to drive an attacking force out of their respective dimensions. Dormammu sends an army of Mindless Ones to attack the city of New York, and trick several prominent Marvel superheroes into unintentionally making him materialize on Earth by tricking them into combining dimensional energies in an attempt to dispel the Mindless Ones. Doctor Strange engages Dormammu in combat, and sends the hero Spider-Man back in time to a critical moment to stop his enemy from being able to re-enter Earth's universe, Spider-Man warning the heroes to delay in their attempts to stop the Mindless Ones long enough for the younger Strange to show up and banish them himself.The Spider-Man story \\"Happy Birthday\\" from: Dormammu returns, now in a symbiotic link with Umar. Together they petition the \\"Pan-dimensional Oversight Council\\" (counting Strange and Nightmare among its members) to perform a preemptive strike against Earth's superhumans, as \\"potential weapons of mass destruction\\", and when the petition fails, Dormammu eats most of the present council-members, whereas Umar reduces the rest to \\"screaming blobs of mindless jelly\\". The siblings then attack and overcome the entity Eternity, and use the acquired power to remake all universes in their hellish image. The pair are opposed by a reuniting of some of the original Defenders (Strange, the Hulk, and Namor the Sub-Mariner), with Dormammu retreating when Umar steals his power. The character also appears briefly during a storyline in which Strange contemplates his past. Acting in secrecy, Dormammu empowers criminal mastermind the Hood, who in turn resurrects several dead supervillains and forms a crime army. When the Hood asks for information about his \\"benefactor\\" from the demoness Satana, she claims that Dormammu disposed of his sister off-page.Dark Reign: The Hood #3 (2009) The character temporarily takes control of the \\"zombie\\" virus that decimates Earth-2149, and also takes advantage of the fact that Strange loses the title of Sorcerer Supreme, but the latter eventually exorcises his influence from the Hood together with Daimon Hellstrom and Doctor Voodoo. 2010s Dormammu briefly appears when the newly appointed \\"Sorcerer Supreme\\" Doctor Voodoo enters his domain. The villain dismisses Voodoo as an \\"unworthy\\" opponent and refers to his vastly inferior \\"gutter gods\\". This, however, causes Voodoo to strengthen the seals to the entity's realm. The character also appears as one of the prospective \\"suitors\\" (holders of a slave-contract) for the hand of Satana.Deadpool Team-Up #892 (2010) During the Fear Itself storyline, Dormammu attended the Devil's Advocacy where they talked about the threat of the Serpent on Earth.Journey Into Mystery #627 Dormammu appears in Uncanny X-Men. After Illyana Rasputin is pulled into Limbo it is revealed that Dormammu is responsible for taking over the realm.Uncanny X-Men vol. 3 #5 Dormammu is apparently killed by Illyana off-page.Uncanny X-Men vol. 3 #6 The entity reappears with a plot to turn humanity into Mindless Ones, but is thwarted by the plans of Phil Coulson, with help from the Absorbing Man and the Howling Commandos.S.H.I.E.L.D.

Marvel Comics. Character Dormammu has been described as \\"something worse than a demon\\". It is unknown exactly how ancient he is, as he inhabits a wholly alien realm, separate from the rest of the Marvel Universe, that defies the laws of physics as understood on Earth. He is known to have already existed at the creation of the current demonic netherworlds; to have clashed with Agamotto hundreds of millions of years ago; to have served as the primary enemy of the Vishanti ever since; and to have been considered an extreme threat by the mages of \\"pre-cataclysm\\" Atlantis. Dormammu is presented as the most powerful and malevolent of \\"the Faltine\\", fictional higher-dimensional mystical energy beings. Not native to the \\"Dark Dimension\\", Dormammu and \\"his\\" sibling Umar were exiled for slaying their progenitor \\"Sinifer\\" and for their morbid/unclean obsession with physical matter. They journeyed to the Dark Dimension in search of experience, and assumed corporeal forms.Doctor Strange vol. 3, #22 (October 1990) Dormammu merged with the local \\"Flames of Regency\\" to further enhance his power, and returned to an energy state, whereas Umar had grown accustomed to physical pleasure. After imprisoning the horde of marauding virtually unstoppable Mindless Ones, Dormammu enslaved the entire realm and demanded worship as its sole deity. He continued to gradually merge other mystical universes to his own, while spreading his worship to any sorcerers throughout the multiverse who invoked his powers.Dr. Strange vol. 2 #72 The character is sometimes shown as incredibly patient, with certain plots to achieve his goals spanning billions of years, whereas others are planned far more recently or even improvised through opportunity. Although extremely intelligent, with tremendous knowledge of the mystic arts, he is overwhelmingly arrogant, generally does not adapt well to sudden confusion and unexpected developments, and has a tendency to gloat over technically outmatched foes rather than swiftly finish them off.Doctor Voodoo: Avenger of the Supernatural #1 (2010) What makes Dormammu different from other prominent Marvel supervillains is that he has been shown as fully capable of personally defeating cosmic entities, even without external power sources and outside of the \\"Dark Dimension\\". Originally genderless siblings, Dormammu and his sister Umar have an unpredictable love-hate relationship. Sometimes loyal and collaborative, other times they gladly betray each other or take the other's power for themselves. Umar has an occasional tendency to sarcastically puncture her brother's obsessive histrionics with more pragmatic sadistic hedonism. Writer Keith Giffen has described them as \\"Donnie and Marie from hell. The brother-sister sibling rivalry relationship blown up to nightmarish, universe-shattering proportions.\\" Nevertheless, Dormammu is \\"completely inhuman\\", the kind of character that \\"commits mass murder... on a whim\\". Powers and abilities Presented as one of the most powerful known mystical entities within the Marvel Universe, Dormammu is acknowledged by Doctor Strange as his \\"most terrible foe\\"; a threat to \\"the life of the universe itself\\", that \\"at full power no one could stand against.\\" The character is an interdimensional entity composed of mystical energy that can be used to achieve almost any effect he desires, including: energy projection, matter manipulation, resizing, teleportation, possession; necromancy, bestowing of power, and creating demon lords.The individual powers list as examples are from: *Bestowing power *Energy projection \\"Avengers/Defenders War\\" (September‚ÄìDecember 1973), Marvel Comics *Size shifting, teleportation *Creating demon lords *Resurrection of the dead *Matter transmutation *Body possession In certain instances Dormammu has been displayed approaching a universal, or even multiversal, scale of influence. Dormammu is apparently stronger in the Dark Dimension, being empowered by the worship of his followers, and can draw upon its power. The character has been shown to have one significant weakness: being vulnerable in environments that cannot fuel his mystical Faltine flames. Other versions Marvel Mangaverse Dormammu is summoned into Marvel Mangaverse by The Incredible Hulk (Nick Fury is revealed to be behind the attacks by the Hulk as well).Marvel Mangaverse: Avengers Assemble!! #1‚Äì4 (2002) Ultimate Marvel In the Ultimate Marvel universe, Dormammu first appears in Ultimatum, which introduces him as a powerful demon who succeeds in killing Doctor Strange (actually the son of the original).Ultimatum #1‚Äì5 (September 2009) The demon was then confronted by Susan Storm and Ben Grimm in front of the destroyed Sanctum Sanctorum. Dormammu was defeated after Susan sealed his entire head with her force-field and being overwhelmed by Johnny Storm's power, turning him into a powerless human being.Ultimatum: Fantastic Four Requiem #1 (2009) In other media Television * Dormammu appears in the 1979 Spider-Woman episode \\"Realm of Darkness\\".

Knowing that the Venom symbiote was due to reproduce and create a new symbiote, Dormammu had Mordo send the rocket it was on back to earth. Using the newly formed Carnage, Dormammu collected humans souls equal to his own and switched places with them. However, Spidey and Venom manage to reverse the process, sealing Dormammu, Carnage and Venom back into \\"hot head's\\" home dimension. *Dormammu appears in The Super Hero Squad Show episode \\"Enter: Dormammu\\", voiced by Robert Englund. Doctor Strange (whose Eye of Agamotto is holding an Infinity Sword fractal) ends up unleashing Dormammu from his Dark Dimension into Super Hero City. A recurring gag during this episode was Falcon asking Dormammu if he knows that his head is on fire. When Dormammu unleashes his Mindless Ones upon Super Hero City, Dormammu manages to steal the fractals from the Vault and Villainville while taking Captain America and Doctor Doom hostage. When the fractal is extracted from the Eye of Agamotto, Doctor Strange then uses a spell to banish Dormammu back into the Dark Dimension. In \\"This Al Dente Earth\\", Doctor Strange briefly pulls Dormammu's head out of the Dark Dimension in order to damage Galactus' machine. In the episode \\"Soul Stone Picnic\\", Dark Surfer called up Dormammu where he tells him that he plans to destroy the universe in the next two episodes. * Dormammu appeared in the Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. episodes \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" and \\"Hulking Commandos\\", voiced by Phil LaMarr. * Dormammu appeared in the Ultimate Spider-Man episode \\"Cloak and Dagger\\", voiced again by Phil LaMarr.

In this reality, Dormammu seeks to absorb all other universes into his Dark Dimension and turn the victims into Mindless Ones. The Zealots misinterpret this eternal existence as a benevolent longevity, and Dormammu gives them some of his power. Doctor Strange, also played by Cumberbatch, uses the Time Stone to trap himself and Dormammu in an endless loop, where he offers a bargain and dies when the entity refuses. Desperate to escape this loop, Dormammu accepts the bargain to end it in exchange for taking his Zealots from the Earth and never returning to it.

It was created by Grant Morrison during his run in New X-Men. The program's purpose is the creation of super-soldiers intended to fight the wars of the future, especially a mutant-human war. Weapon X, the organization's most well-known program, was originally the tenth installation, but eventually it branched off and became an independent program with similar purposes. Morrison's introduction of Weapon Plus also shed new information about the origins of Weapon X, Captain America and other Marvel Comics supersoldiers. Fictional team history During the 1940s the existence of mutants was not yet known to the general public. A few individuals were aware of the coming of Homo superior and the fact that they had the potential to replace baseline humans as the dominant species of Earth. Thus Weapon Plus was created to address the so-called mutant problem. What was unknown by everyone involved in Weapon Plus is that its mastermind, John Sublime, was actually the host body for a sentient bacteria present in every living creature on the planet, save for mutants, who were genetically immune to the Sublime infection.Wolverine: Origins #33.Marvel ComicsWeapon X Vol. 2 #23. Marvel Comics The first nine installments of Weapon Plus were partially successful. Weapon X produced a number of agents, though it branched off and even became opposed to Weapon Plus's interests. To prevent subsidiary programs from going rogue, Weapon Plus directly oversaw the creation of the last living weapons operating in the clandestine facilities of The World, employing Bolivar Trask's Sentinel technology.New X-Men #142-145. Marvel Comics Throughout the decades, Weapon Plus has used increasingly more extreme methods to create its super-soldiers. Captain America was enhanced to peak human levels. Weapon X employed genetic alteration, brainwashing and memory implants. The latest creations were bred specifically to become mutant-hunting weapons much deadlier than Sentinels. Following M-Day, most of mutantkind has been rendered powerless, and mutants as a race are on the brink of extinction. Weapon Plus appears again as Sublime attempts to use the Stepford Cuckoos to wipe out the surviving mutants. Programs Weapon 0 Project: Rebirth began as a collaboration between the American, British and German eugenicists led by Doctors Reinstein and Koch. When World War II began, Koch took over the German program, and Josef Reinstein (Erskine) moved to the American program. John Steele, also known as American Soldier, was a Super-Soldier of unknown origin who fought in World War I. His body was kept in stasis by Nazi scientists, including Abraham Ersekine, who sought to replicate his abilities as part of Project: Nietzche, but with little success.Marvels Project #1. Marvel Comics Weapon I Project: Rebirth, headed by Professor Abraham Erskine (given the alias Josef Reinstein as a cover identity) managed to produce Captain America (Steve Rogers). However, Erskine was murdered moments after Rogers was successfully empowered, the refinements he introduced which made the process successful lost with his death. With his demise, Koch took over the American program. Two other subjects, Clinton McIntyre, a.k.a. Protocide, a failed experiment who was placed in suspended animation and was revived in the modern era by AIM, and the first mutant experiment designated Queen seem to have occurred prior to the Super Soldier Serum being tested on Steve Rogers. Early attempts to recreate the formula resulted in African American super soldiers (most prominently Isaiah Bradley). Three hundred African-American soldiers were taken from Camp Cathcart and subjected to potentially fatal experiments at an undisclosed location, as seen in Truth: Red, White & Black in an attempt to recreate the Super Soldier formula. Only five men survived the original trials; hundreds of test subjects left behind at Camp Cathcart and the camp's commander were executed by US soldiers in the name of secrecy, the families of the three hundred were told that they had died in battle. Isaiah Bradley was the lone survivor. Although there were many later attempts to recreate or reverse-engineer Project: Rebirth's Super- Soldier Serum, none are known to have been involved with Weapon Plus except for the attempt that resulted in the creation of Isaiah Bradley's son Josiah X. Weapon Plus considers Captain America as its most successful creation, despite the fact that Rogers has been at odds with the United States government a number of times. Project: Rebirth was retroactively made a part of the Weapon Plus after WWII when Weapon Plus was actually formed. Weapon II Weapon II experimented on animals. It was implied by Grant Morrison that these animal weapons were the animal cyborgs in the comic We3, not published by Marvel. Weapon II was later captured as part of a group of semi-animal characters including Howard the Duck, Squirrel Girl, Beast, and Rocket Raccoon. He appeared as a squirrel with Wolverine's \\"Adamantium skeleton, claws, intelligence, and healing factor\\" (though his claws make a \\"SNUKT\\" sound compared to Wolverine's \\"SNIKT\\"). Weapon II also sports a visor and many of Wolverine's mannerisms.The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl #6, 2016Howard the Duck #6, 2016 In Wolverine and Captain America Weapon Plus #1 (July 2019), it is implied that the team Brute Force, made of animal cyborg hybrids, was part of the Weapon II program. Weapon III Like Weapons II and IV, Weapon III was originally said to be experiments on animals, however, this was later retconned. Weapon III (Harry Pizer)Marvel Atlas #1, November 2007Excalibur (1st series) #87, July 1995Uncanny X-Force (1st series) #22, April 2012 was a mutant with elastic multi-sensory skin. Originally a barrister, he was recruited by the Weapon Plus program to help protect his nation from the approaching Cold War. His skin's durability and elasticity was enhanced. He originally worked in espionage, gathering intelligence from the Soviets. He was eventually sent to Otherworld in order to retrieve the Orb of Necromancy. However he was stopped by Fantomex and, for the many deaths he caused, subsequently punished by the Captain Britain Corps and flayed alive, his skin machined off and used to form sentient bullets, some of which came to be possessed by Genoshan soldiers. He survived, however, and taught his muscles to function in a similar manner to his former mutant skin.Uncanny X-Force, #22, 2012 He later worked with Black Air and the Brotherhood of Mutants and was known as the Skinless Man. He developed a hatred of Fantomex, who he blamed for his current state. He later murdered Fantomex by ripping out his heart. He was later killed in retaliation by Deadpool.Uncanny X-Force #34 Weapons IV Weapons IV, was said to be employed on various criminals that were ethnic minorities as test subjects. However, Weapon IV is actually 'Project Sulfur' - the project spearheaded by Ted Sallis, whose research led him to become the Man-Thing. Weapon V Weapon V was originally believed to have been performed on ethnic people,New X-Men #130. Marvel Comics. but then during the Vietnam War, the program under the name of Sym-soldier program used pieces of the ancient symbiote named Grendel and bonded to various soldiers in order to fight in the War. However, the program was shut down after the soldiers were driven mad by the symbiotes and were captured by Nick Fury and Logan.Venom Vol. 4 #1-5. Marvel ComicsWeb of Venom: Ve'nam #1. Marvel Comics When the government got hold of the Venom symbiote, they decided to use it as part of Weapon V under the name of Project Rebirth 2.0 to create a new soldier with symbiote augmentation. They bonded the suit to former veteran Flash Thompson which resulted in the creation of Agent Venom.The Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 1 #654 Project Rebirth 2.0 is later shut down by Captain America. Weapon VI Weapon VI was led by Dr. Noah Burstein and was responsible for giving Luke Cage his powers.Wolverine & Captain America: Weapon Plus #1. Marvel Comics Weapon VII Weapon VII, a.k.a. Project: Homegrown, experimented on human soldiers during the Vietnam War. Some of the known participants who died in Project: Homegrown included Andrew Perlmutter, Michael Labash, John Walsh, James MacPherson and fourteen other unknown recruits. The only known successful subject of Project: Homegrown was Nuke, who had armored implants under his epidermis and was addicted to powerful narcotics. Logan, who would later become one of Weapon Plus' victims, kidnapped Nuke as a child, and oversaw his conditioning. Weapon VII also experimented with adamantium bonding, which helped create Cyber. The United Kingdom also had its own version of Project: Homegrown, a.k.a. the Black Budget, which managed to create the team known as the Super Soldiers: Dauntless, Gog, Dreadnaught, Revenge, Victory, Invincible, Challenger, and some unnamed super-soldiers. The Mercy Corporation, an offshoot of S.H.I.E.L.D. that worked on super-soldiers and eventually broke off, also had its own unit of super-soldiers, using a serum similar to previous derivatives of the Super-Soldier Serum from Weapon I. Their agents included Jack Reno, Keel, Kyle, Agent Villarosa, Agent Davis and Agent Milo. Weapon VIII Weapons VIII experimented on criminals and psychopaths. Weapon IX Weapon IX (according to artist Rob Liefeld) was originally supposed to be Wade Wilson, a.k.a. Deadpool. Weapon IX is later revealed to be project 'Psyche', none other than Typhoid Mary. Weapon X The Weapon X Program experimented on mutants, most notably Wolverine. Later, however, the Weapon X Program branched off into other fields, employing and/or experimenting on a number of test subjects such as Sabretooth. Eventually the program was shut down and became a part of the Canadian government known as Department K. Deadpool, who was a Weapon X reject, was created by Department K. The Facility, a civilian project with connections to the military Weapon X program, would eventually create X-23, a female clone of Wolverine created using genetic material salvaged from the original project. Weapon XI No character under the official title of Weapon XI has been revealed. However; according to artist Rob Liefeld, Weapon XI was originally intended to be Garrison Kane, who went on to be better known as simply Kane, or confusingly Weapon X. Weapon XII Weapon Plus created Weapon XII (a.k.a. Huntsman, real name Zona Cluster 6) at the England-based facilities of The World. He was the first living weapon created employing artificial evolution and nanosentinel technology. Weapon XII was \\"accidentally\\" unleashed on the Channel Tunnel and fought X-Corporation members Cannonball, M, Darkstar, Rictor, Siryn and Multiple Man. Weapon XII was eliminated by Fantomex with the aid of Jean Grey and Professor X, but at the cost of Darkstar's life. Huntsman was created to be part of the Super-Sentinels, a mutant-hunting team of superheroes with a base in a Weapon Plus space station. This team, a brainchild of John Sublime, was intended to be a publicity stunt to make the genocide of mutants much more acceptable to the public.New X-Men #128-130. Marvel Comics Weapon XIII Weapon Plus created Weapon XIII, also known as Fantomex, at The World. However, Fantomex rebelled against his creators. As in the case of Weapon XII, Fantomex's powers derive from Nanosentinel technology. Weapon XIV In New X-Men #154 (May 2004), Grant Morrison's last issue of New X-Men, the telepathic quintuplets called the Stepford Cuckoos were identified as Weapon XIV. The Stepford Cuckoos' link to Weapon Plus has finally been addressed in the Phoenix: Warsong miniseries, written by Greg Pak, which explores unresolved storylines from Morrison's New X-Men and Pak's Phoenix: Endsong. Weapon XV Weapon XV, a.k.a. Ultimaton, was designed to be the Super-Sentinels' grand powerhouse. He was killed after Wolverine destroyed the Weapon Plus space station that was designed as the Super-Sentinels HQ. Ultimaton was recently resurrected in The World and tasked by Fantomex with guarding a hidden chamber which held a child Apocalypse clone created from a blood sample taken from the one previously executed on the Celestial Ship. Weapon XVI Weapon XVI, a.k.a. Allgod, is a \\"living religion\\", a virus that \\"attacks the faith reserves\\". People infected by Allgod worship the World, and become fanatically devoted slaves to it. Wolverine, Fantomex, and Noh-Varr team up to shut down the World (which has now become sentient), its weapons production, and Allgod along with it.Dark Reign: The List: Wolverine Weapon Infinity Weapon Infinity, also known as Project: Deathlok, is the cyborg conversion of both ordinary citizens and then all superheroes in the future. The first steps were the reanimation of military corpses, then the wholesale conversion of dead bodies into \\"Deathloks\\", modeled after the hero of the same name. The Deathloks were then used to hunt down and convert all heroes of the future. Project: Deathlok was first seen in Dark Reign: The List: Wolverine, and later fleshed out in the final arc of Wolverine: Weapon X. Uncanny X-Force has since elaborated on the project, revealing it to be Weapon Infinity during the 'Deathlok Nation' arc.Uncanny X-Force #5-7. Marvel Comics  Weapon Minus  A number of scientists were funded by S.H.I.E.L.D to counteract the Weapon Plus program in case it went rogue. In what was explicitly labelled the Weapon Minus program, one of these scientists, when his branch of the project had his funding and materials cut, was forced to test the resultant mixture of Super- Soldier Serum and LSD on himself, the result was named Doctor Mindbubble, who had the psychic ability to create miniature mind-universes that could trap almost anyone.Captain America vol. 7, #17 He was intended to counter Weapon VII. American Kaiju This program used already existing substances in order to create a new super-soldier. They used the Gamma radiaton, Beast's Mutant Growth Hormone, Pym Particles and the Lizard formula which resulted in Todd Ziller becoming a monster similar to Godzilla.New Avengers Vol. 4 #9. Marvel Comics The World The World is a secret lab owned by the Weapon Plus Project, in which the program scientists intend to create superior humans employing eugenics, nanotechnology and artificial evolution technology (time is \\"artificial\\" at the World and it can be frozen or altered in any way the Program Scientists desire). The artificial time technology employed by Weapon Plus was stolen from AIM. A low level of gamma radiation is constantly present to produce mutations in the population. The human DNA of the inhabitants' ancestors in this artificial environment was spliced with sentinel microtechnology, meaning they are no longer humans in the traditional meaning of the word, as they have evolved into a race of mutated and naturally born cyborgs refined through eugenics. Because the scientists have absolute control over the time inside The World (according to Fantomex the time is \\"liquid\\"), both freezing it and speeding it up so that decades and centuries can pass within it while time runs normally in the real world, this opens up for new possibilities within the areas of eugenics and genetic engineering. The most promising individuals in each generation are selected while the others are terminated. Also natural selection in the form of the survival of the fittest is possible by exposing the population to different forms of selective pressure. This way, new breeds of superhumans can be evolved within a few months, instead of hundreds or thousands of years. Half a million years inside The World represents only eighteen months on the outside. The World's facilities contains a population (with its own religion, history and culture) that is led to believe that beyond the World's limits there's nothing, other than endless rock and mutants who are coming to destroy them. Those who are selected for termination believe there is a reward awaiting them at the other side. The World is also filled with numerous experiments and prototypes of Weapon Plus, such as techno-organic human-animal car-cops. The World was partially destroyed when agents of AIM attacked the facilities in order to recover the technology Weapon Plus stole from them. They are soon killed by Weapon XV. After years of being uninhabited the World itself, still operational though abandoned, has itself became sentient, and is continuing to make super advanced Weapons. Wolverine and Noh-Varr head to the World to try and stop Norman Osborn from claiming it and its creations as part of H.A.M.M.E.R. While there they are attacked by a large army of mutant zombies, soon revealed to be infected by Weapon XVI, \\"Allgod\\". Noh-Varr is rescued by Fantomex, who is there to retrieve the World's brain to help reprogram it into becoming a more benevolent and peaceful being. The two make their way to the World's brain, where they are confronted by the Allgod zombies, which now include Wolverine. Noh-Varr is able to disarm Allgod by kissing the World's brain, showing it some compassion. Immediately after this, Osborn's agent, a remote controlled robot zombie, plunges its fist into the World's brain, removing part of the brain, only for Wolverine to slice the robot zombie's arm off. Fantomex then uses a shrink-ray he stole from Doctor Doom to shrink the brain, and he takes the brain for his own currently unrevealed purposes. In other media Film * In the films X-Men and X2, flashbacks show Wolverine has participated in the Weapon X program run by William Stryker, but has no memory of it. The Weapon X facility is revealed to be in Alkali Lake, Alberta. It is destroyed when the dam fails. Jean Grey holds back the water allowing the X-Men to escape, but is killed in the process. In X-Men: The Last Stand, Alkali is revisited by Scott Summers who is telekinetically drawn to Alkali. He sees the reborn Jean who inadvertently kills him. Logan and Storm are sent to Alkali Lake to investigate, where they find Jean as Phoenix. * In the 2008 Marvel Studios film The Incredible Hulk, General Ross can be seen extracting an experimental super-soldier serum created by Dr. Reinstein from a cold storage lab where the containers are marked \\"Weapons Plus\\". * After the success of the three X-Men films, the studio produced a spin-off film X-Men Origins: Wolverine. This film explains and expands on the origins of Logan/Wolverine, including his time at the Weapon X facility. It explains that Weapon X is the tenth weapon created by the lab. Each weapon is a living mutant enhanced by technological means. Weapon X (Wolverine) is given adamantium bones to increase his durability. Weapon XI was portrayed in the film as a genetically altered Wade Wilson played by both Scott Adkins and Ryan Reynolds. Weapon XI is also referred to by Col. William Stryker as \\"Deadpool\\", due to having powers \\"pooled\\" from many other mutants killed and/or kidnapped in the film, including Wolverine's healing factor, Cyclops' optic blasts, Wraith's teleportation ability, and Chris Bradley's technopathy. He also has retractable blades extending from his arms. Weapon XI is the final antagonist of the film, having been genetically altered to be the ultimate mutant killer. His head is cut off by Wolverine while his back is turned battling Sabretooth. In a post-credits scene of some prints, his body looks for and finds his head in the rubble, which returns to life (and gains a mouth, which he previously lacked). * Project Rebirth (Weapon I) appears in Captain America: The First Avenger. Rebirth is Strategic Scientific Reserve project to create a new line of Super-Soldiers for its World War II effort against the Red Skull and his division. It began with a collaboration between US, British and German scientists led by Dr. Abraham Erskine and under the supervision of Peggy Carter, Howard Stark and Chester Phillips. * Alkali Lake is featured again in X-Men: Apocalypse run again by Stryker In 1983, he captured members of the X-Men, because they were suspects behind sudden nuclear launches into space by the ancient mutant Apocalypse. However, a few of them released an imprisoned Weapon X upon the base, and he tore through the base's security and escaped. The X-Men escaped as well using a jet in the hangar while it was later raided by personnel of the Essex Corporation to retrieve what remained of the Weapon X Program. Novels * In the non-canonical novel Wolverine: Violent Tendencies, Weapon 0 is referred to as \\"Weapon Null\\", and is an early and dismissed branch of a super-soldier program completely different from the Weapon Plus program of the comics. Weapon Null was focused on the utilisation of bioenhancement to upgrade soldiers into organic self-contained weapons; the grotesque creations require extensive and expensive maintenance and transportation conditions, so the program was shelved. During the course of the novel, Wolverine encounters four of Weapon Null's more successful creations: \\"Slammer\\", \\"Blowtorch\\", \\"Cypher\\" and \\"Bipolar\\".

They were exported to Europe in large quantities, especially between the second half of the 17th century and the first half of the 18th century. Typically Imari ware (in the English use of the term) is decorated in underglaze blue, with red, gold, black for outlines, and sometimes other colours, added in overglaze. In the most characteristic floral designs most of the surface is coloured, with \\"a tendency to overdecoration that leads to fussiness\\". The style was so successful that Chinese and European producers began to copy it.Impey (1990), 74‚Äì75, 75 quoted Sometimes the different overglaze styles of Kakiemon and Kutani ware are also grouped under Imari ware. The name derives from the port of Imari, Saga, from which they were shipped to Nagasaki, where the Dutch East India Company and the Chinese had trading outposts. In the West the multi-coloured or \\"enamelled\\" wares became known as \\"Imari ware\\", and a different group kakiemon, while blue and white wares were called \\"Arita ware\\"; in fact the types were often produced at the same kilns.Impey (1990), 73 Today, the use of \\"Imari\\" as a descriptor has declined, and they are often called Arita wares (or Hizen wares, after the old province). Imari ware was copied in both China and Europe, and has been continuously produced to the present day. \\"Early Imari\\" water jar, 1630s \\"Early Imari\\" (shoki imari) is a traditional and somewhat confusing term used for very different wares that were made around Arita before about 1650. The porcelains are generally small and sparsely painted in underglaze blue for the domestic market, but there are also some large green celadon dishes, apparently made for the southeast Asian market, in a porcellaneous stoneware.Ford and Impey, 66; Anna Willmann, \\"Edo-Period Japanese Porcelain\\", Essay , Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, The Metropolitan Museum of Art; \\"Ko-Imari (Old Imari) Japanese porcelain\\", Jan- Erik Nilsson, Gotheborg.com History \\"Imari\\" was simply the trans-shipment port for Arita wares, from where they went to the foreign trading outposts at Nagasaki. It was the kilns at Arita which formed the heart of the Japanese porcelain industry.Impey (1990), 70‚Äì73 Arita's kilns were set up in the 17th century, after kaolin was discovered in 1616. A popular legend attributes the discovery to an immigrant Korean potter, Yi Sam-pyeong (1579‚Äì1655), although most historians consider this doubtful. After the discovery, some kilns began to produce revised Korean-style blue and white porcelains, known as Early Imari, or \\"Shoki-Imari\\". In the mid-17th century there were also many Chinese refugees in northern Kyushu due to the turmoil in China, and it is said that one of them brought the overglaze enamel coloring technique to Arita. Thus Shoki-Imari developed into Ko-Kutani, Imari, and later Kakiemon, which are sometimes taken as a wider group of Imari wares. Ko-Kutani was produced around 1650 for both export and domestic market. Kutani ware is characterized by vivid green, blue, purple, yellow and red colors in bold designs of landscapes and nature. Blue and white porcelain pieces continued to be produced and they are called Ai-Kutani. Ko-Kutani Imari for the export market usually adopted Chinese design structure such as kraak style, whereas Ai-Kutani for the domestic market were highly unique in design and are accordingly valued very much among collectors. 18th-century Imari covered tureen in the District Museum, Tarn√≥w; an example of export porcelain collected by Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth's magnateria Ko-Kutani style evolved into Kakiemon-style Imari, which was produced for about 50 years around 1700. Kakiemon was characterized by crisp lines, and bright blue, red and green designs of dramatically stylized floral and bird scenes. Imari achieved its technical and aesthetic peak in the Kakiemon style, and it dominated the European market. Blue and white Kakiemon is called Ai-Kakiemon. The Kakiemon style transformed into Kinrande in the 18th century, using underglaze blue and overglaze red and gold enamels, and later additional colors. Imari began to be exported to Europe when the Chinese kilns at Jingdezhen were damaged in the political chaos and the new Qing dynasty government halted trade in 1656‚Äì1684. Exports to Europe were made through the Dutch East India Company, and in Europe the designation \\"Imari porcelain\\" connotes Arita wares of mostly Kinrande Imari. Export of Imari to Europe stopped in mid-18th century when China resumed export to Europe, since Imari was not able to compete against Chinese products due to high labor costs. By that time, however, both Imari and Kakiemon styles were already so popular among Europeans that the Chinese export porcelain copied both, a type known as Chinese Imari. At the same time, European kilns, such as Meissen and English potteries such as Johnson Bros. and (Royal) Crown Derby, also imitated the Imari and Kakiemon styles. Export of Imari surged again in late 19th century (Meiji era) when Japonism flourished in Europe. Thus in the western world today, two kinds of true Japanese Imari can be found: that exported in the mid-Edo period, and that exported in the Meiji era. From the viewpoint of collectors, these two types are completely different, though Kinrande appearances are similar. Characteristics Though there are many types of Imari ware, the type usually so called in the West is called kinrande in Japanese, and was produced for export in large quantities from the mid-17th century until the export trade tailed off around 1740. Kinrande has underglaze cobalt blue and overglaze red and gold, and sometimes other colors. The color combination was not seen in China at that time. Traditional Ming dynasty color porcelain used dominantly red and green, probably due to scarcity of gold in China, whereas gold was abundant in Japan in those days. The subject matter of Arita is diverse, ranging from foliage and flowers to people, scenery and abstractions. Some designs such as Kraak porcelain were adopted from China, but most designs were uniquely Japanese owing to the rich Japanese tradition of paintings and costume design. The porcelain has a gritty texture on the base, where it is not covered by glaze.  Chinese Imari  Chinese Imari porcelain vases of the Kangxi period (1662‚Äì1722), Qing dynasty Though sophisticated wares in authentic Japanese styles were being made at Arita for the fastidious home market, European‚Äìstyle designations of Arita porcelain were formed after blue and white kraak porcelains, imitating Chinese underglaze \\"blue-and-white\\" wares, or made use of enamel colors over underglazes of cobalt blue and iron red. The ware often used copious gilding, sometimes with spare isolated sprigged vignettes, but often densely patterned in compartments. There were two quite different styles in these wares.Oliver Impey, \\"Japanese export art of the Edo Period and its influence on European art\\", Modern Asian Studies 18.4, Special Issue: Edo Culture and Its Modern Legacy (1984, pp. 685‚Äì697) p. 695. \\"On the one hand a gaudy, brash brightly coloured and highly decorated style, the Imari style.\\" Globular Imari teapots with swan-necked spouts helped establish the classic European form for these new necessities of life. Dutch traders had a monopoly on the insatiable export trade, the first large order being placed at Arita by the Dutch East India Company in 1656. The trade peaked in the late 17th century and was slowly replaced by Chinese kilns in the early 18th century; it ended in 1756, as social conditions in China settled with the full establishment of the Qing Dynasty. Imitating Arita designs, fine \\"Chinese Imari\\" export wares were produced in the 18th century, eclipsing the original Japanese exports.  European Imari  Imperial Viennese Porcelain Manufactory, 1744/49 European centers imitated the style of Imari wares, initially in faience at Delft in the Netherlands. Imari patterns, as well as \\"Kakiemon\\" designs and palette of colors, influenced some early Orientalizing wares produced by the porcelain manufactories at Meissen, Chantilly, or later at Vincennes and in Vienna. It was also produced in the early 19th century at Robert Chamberlain's Worcester porcelain factory at Worcester, as well as Crown Derby porcelain, where Imari patterns remain popular to the present.

The first team was a brief offshoot of the team Defenders, and the second is part of an initiative to place a superhero team in each state of the United States. Publication history Defenders offshoot The original incarnation of The Order starred in the six-issue limited series The Order (April-Sept. 2002) intending to conquer the world in order to protect it. The team consisted of the original Defenders: Doctor Strange, The Incredible Hulk, Namor the Sub-Mariner and Silver Surfer. Initiative version A second Marvel Comics superhero team called The Order debuted in The Order vol. 2, #1 (Sept. 2007), created by writer Matt Fraction and penciler Barry Kitson. Following the fallout of Marvel Comics' Civil War crossover event, The Order was dubbed the First Super Hero Team of Tomorrow being the official superhero team for California as part of the Fifty States Initiative. The group was originally intended to be named The Champions, before it was revealed that the trademark was owned by Heroic Publishing, and were first seen during the end of the Civil War with many of its members going unnamed during their first appearances. However, most would be a part of the new series though the designs of the characters were slightly altered. As the cast of The Order is composed almost entirely of new characters, Fraction looked to a popular TV drama for ideas on how to acquaint readers with his protagonists. Fraction framed each issue around a flashback sequence depicting an interview with each character explaining their past and why they joined the Order to give each character a detailed introduction. In late January 2008, Fraction revealed on Newsarama's podcast \\"Word Balloon\\" that The Order would end at issue 10. Though at first it was believed that Marvel had canceled the series, Fraction later stated on a later Newsarama interview that Though the series was ended several of the book's characters and storylines would continue on in Matt Fraction's next project The Invincible Iron Man. The group also appeared in the 2008 Eternals series and Avengers: The Initiative #18.

During the peak of his fame, Hellrung and Stark were regular fixtures in the celebrity nightlife scene. However Hellrung's hard partying eventually turned him into an alcoholic and cost him his job and reputation within the industry. Hellrung joined Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), recovered, and eventually became well known for his activism within the organization. When Tony Stark himself also became an alcoholic, he joined AA and was sponsored by Hellrung.

He played in Major League Baseball from to as a third baseman and outfielder for the San Diego Padres (1980‚Äì84, 1987, 1989), Chicago White Sox (1985‚Äì86), Detroit Tigers (1988), and the Chicago Cubs (1989‚Äì92). Salazar is currently the manager for the A advanced Florida Fire Frogs. Baseball career In 1973, he signed with the Kansas City Royals but was released in 1974. He signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1975. On August 5, 1980, Salazar, along with Rick Lancellotti, was traded to the San Diego Padres for a player to be named later and Kurt Bevacqua. The Padres later sent Mark Lee to Pittsburgh to complete the trade. After seven minors seasons, finally, he got a chance with San Diego in the 1980 season. An extremely versatile reserve who played every position but catcher in his career, Salazar was the Padres' third baseman between 1981 and 1983. He was traded to the White Sox along with Ozzie Guill√©n (1985), and returned to the Padres as a free agent (1987). Then, he signed with Detroit (1988), before being dealt back to San Diego. Salazar finished his career with the Cubs. In his first stint with the Padres, Salazar hit 29 home runs with 187 runs batted in and 109 stolen bases in 525 games. In 126 games with the White Sox, he played on third base, first base, shortstop and outfield (eventually was DH and relief pitcher), batting .245 with 10 homers and 45 RBI. For Detroit, mostly in the outfield, he hit .270, 12, 62. Also, he kept the Tigers in a pennant race by filling in at shortstop for injured Alan Trammell. On August 31, 1989, a few minutes before the postseason rosters must be filed, the Cubs obtained Salazar from San Diego in a last effort to replace their four slumping third basemen. Salazar gave the club a lift in September, playing a solid third base and batting .325 (26-80) with 12 RBI and a .357 on- base percentage. The Cubs won the National League East division title. The next three seasons Salazar played predominantly on third base, batting .243 with 31 homers, 110 RBI, and 78 runs in 316 games. In a 1,302-game career, Salazar batted .261 with 179 home runs, 653 RBI, 438 runs scored, 1070 hits, 144 doubles, 33 triples and 117 stolen bases. Salazar was also a valuable pinch-hitter in his career. He went 28-for-91 for a .308 of batting average, with four home runs and 17 runs batted in. He has served as a hitting coach with the Louisville RiverBats (1999), Indianapolis Indians (2000), Milwaukee Brewers, Jacksonville Suns (2008) and Chattanooga Lookouts (2009). Salazar was inducted into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame in 2010. Salazar joined the Atlanta Braves organization in 2011 and was poised to serve as the manager of their Class A-Advanced minor league affiliate, the Lynchburg Hillcats of the Carolina League. On March 9, 2011, he was struck in the face by a foul ball hit by Braves catcher Brian McCann during a spring training game between the Braves and the St. Louis Cardinals. He was airlifted to a local hospital to undergo surgery. Salazar had his left eye removed on March 15, 2011 due to the injuries he sustained from the incident. After the injury, Salazar stated that he intended to continue working for the Braves organization, and he was expected to return to manage the Hillcats once medically cleared to return to work. Salazar returned to the Hillcats dugout on April 15, 2011. Salazar was named manager for the A advanced Florida Fire Frogs in the Atlanta Braves organization for the 2018 season.

It is also called \\"Whitewater racing\\" or \\"Downriver racing\\" to distinguish it from whitewater slalom racing and whitewater rodeo or Freestyle competition. General The objective of the sport is to go from the starting point of the course on a river to the end point as quickly as possible. Typical wildwater venues consist of Class II - IV whitewater, in contrast to extreme racing, which takes place on more difficult streams. Match competitions generally consist of a classic and a sprint race. A classic course is 4 to 6 miles (6‚Äì10 km) in length or 10 to 35 minutes in duration, while the Sprint is between 500 and 750 meters and lasts around 2 minutes. Although there is some specialization, the vast majority of racers compete in both classic and sprint. Competitors are placed in classes based on gender and boat type as follows: *K1 ‚Äì solo kayak, male *K1W ‚Äì solo kayak, female *C1 ‚Äì solo canoe, male *C1W ‚Äì solo canoe, female *C2 ‚Äì tandem canoe. The competitors are numbered within their class based on results from previous races and compete in reverse order (best paddler last), usually at one-minute intervals. To race successfully, paddlers must possess refined technical skill, as well as strength, endurance, aerobic capacity, and the ability to \\"read\\" whitewater. Whitewater racing is also practiced by competing teams; each team is made by a group of three competitors belonging to the same class. Whitewater racing started in Europe with the International Canoe Federation being formed and having the first World Championships in Switzerland in 1949. Since then, there has been a World Championships every two years. Since 2011 there is a sprint only world championships, with sprint and classic being contested every other (even) year. Boat design  Wildwater canoeist * Wildwater solo kayaks (K1) are 4.5 m (14 ft 9 in) long and 60 cm (23.6 in) wide; * Wildwater solo canoes (C-1) are 4.3 m (14 ft 1 in) long and 70 cm (27.5 in) wide; * Wildwater tandem canoes (C-2) are 5 m (16 ft 5 in) long and 80 cm (31.5 in) wide.International Canoe Federation Wildwater Canoeing Rules 2013 Final. Retrieved Nov. 19, 2014. The boats all have a rounded hull profile, making them fast but unstable and hard to turn. Rather than using wide sweep strokes to turn the boat, the paddler tilts the boat to one side, utilizing its curved profile to effect the turn in a manner similar to \\"carving a turn\\" in skiing. Two \\"wings\\" (flaring protrusions near the stern hull) meet the minimum width required by racing rules and add secondary stability, as well as enhancing the effect of carving a turn. When the boat is under way, most of each wing will be above the waterline so as to minimize drag. The use of kevlar, carbon fiber, and glass-reinforced plastic construction has substantially reduced the weight of wildwater boats, while improving stiffness. The top part (the deck) and the bottom (the hull) are molded separately and then bonded together using kevlar or glass cloth strips and epoxy or polyester resin. A boat can be made in 2 to 3 days, but without an oven can take weeks to cure fully. Before glass-reinforced plastic boats, the common racing craft was the folding kayak, usually composed of a wooden frame covered with canvas. Competitors are also required to wear an appropriate whitewater helmet and PFD and River shoes or booties and flotation bags for their boats. Training and racing Racers paddle down a course along the fastest jets of water. In order to go fast, they follow the edges of wave trains and hold as straight a line as possible down the river. If it is unclear which line is fastest, two paddlers simultaneously float the different options and see which boat moves ahead. Because of the high speeds, racers frequently run a river two or three times a day when training for a race. Some racers practice on rivers if they are lucky to live near one. Usually they will paddle 5‚Äì10 miles a day, five to six days a week. Others practice on lakes or flatwater rivers. In northern areas rivers and lakes freeze, so racers sometimes train in an indoor pool, lift weights, run or do Cross- country skiing. When the rivers and lakes become free of ice then training is resumed outdoors. Rivers Popular whitewater racing courses in Scotland include Grandtully and Stanley on the River Tay. Whitewater racing courses in England include the Washburn and the Tees. Popular whitewater racing courses in Wales include the Tryweryn, and the Dee. In the United States, races take place throughout the Southeast, Northeast, Northwest, and Western states; rivers there include the Nantahala and Pigeon in North Carolina and the Ocoee in Tennessee. There are also well-attended annual races on West Virginia's Cheat and Gauley rivers, Maryland's Potomac and Youghiogheny (\\"Yough\\") rivers, as well as on Colorado's Arkansas for the annual Fibark Festival which has the oldest continually run downriver/wildwater race in the USA. Rivers in Europe that have held international races include the Is√®re in Bourg St Maurice, France, the Loisach in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, the Liffey in Ireland and the Tepl√° in Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic. In South Africa races take place on the Trichardt Spruit, Umkomaas River, Bushmans River and As River. The As River forms part of a water exchange program between South Africa and Lesotho and is fed via a tunnel from the Katse Dam.

The book chronicles the experiences of three men (Harris, Allard Lowenstein, and Dennis Sweeney) amid the political and social tumult of the 1960s, as well as the aftermath of these experiences. Specifically, paranoid schizophrenia and two decades of accumulated disillusionment and homophobia eventually led a deranged Sweeney to murder Lowenstein. One-term Congressman Lowenstein, \\"the world's oldest student activist,\\" had, by his forties, lived decades in various political arenas. From the Mississippi Freedom Summer project in the Deep South, to the Dump Johnson campaign of 1968, Allard was passionate and well-connected in liberal circles. He was most likely bisexual before the word was current., Harris's detailed and historical narration, written in an attempt to explain the lives of each of the characters, discusses how the three activists began their affiliations at Stanford University, and continued through the turbulent decade. Lowenstein's sexual orientation reappears throughout the book and serves as one of many connections between the three main figures: both Harris and Sweeney rejected overt passes from Lowenstein; Harris's reaction was thoughtful, empathetic, and verbal; but Sweeney's reaction was decidedly irrational and physical and ended in murder. Dreams Die Hard was adapted into a two-act play of the same name by John Binder which was first produced at the Met Theater in Hollywood in 1995.

The rate of exploitation is often also called the rate of surplus-value. Meaning The surplus value rate is the ratio between the surplus value obtained from the exploitation of unpaid working hours and variable capital, i.e. the actual cost of workers' wages, based on the work needed. The surplus value given by unpaid working hours is due to the fact that the wage is fixed (therefore the daily cost of the worker is also fixed) while the value that is produced is variable (based on the work done) and is generally higher than the daily cost of the worker. In Marx's interpretation, this is a misdemeanor. In symbols, by indicating with s the essay of the surplus value, Pv the surplus value and v the variable capital you have: : s = P v / v Marx also indicates it as an exploitation essay, as it offers the measure as a percentage of the exploitation of labour force. Divergence of the two rates Marx did not regard the rate of surplus value and the rate of exploitation as necessarily identical, insofar as there was a divergence between surplus value realised and surplus value produced. Thus, the quantity of surplus labour performed by workers in an enterprise might correspond to a value higher or lower than the surplus value actually realised as profit income upon sales of output. The implication is that if the gross profit volume was related to wage costs to establish the rate of surplus value, this might overstate or understate the real rate of labor-exploitation. Although this is a subtle point, it has sometimes played an important role in wage bargaining negotiations by trade unions. For an extreme example, workers might work extremely hard in an enterprise which nevertheless operates at a loss. For another extreme example, workers might work less hard, knowing that their product will sell like hotcakes in a sellers market at sharply inflated prices, yielding profits disproportionate to labour input. The divergence between surplus value realised and surplus value produced becomes even more marked if surplus value is viewed in terms of the net incomes of social classes, i.e. net labor income and net property income. Marx identified five different formulae for the rate of surplus value (see surplus value).

It is a special concept derived from his more basic concepts of 'value composition of capital' and 'technical compositon of capital'. He discussed it in detail in Capital Vol. 1, chapter 25 (\\"The General law of Capitalist Accumulation\\"). The 'technical compositon of capital' measures the relation between the elements of constant capital (plant, equipment and materials) and variable capital (wage workers). It is 'technical' because no valuation is here involved. In contrast, the 'value composition of capital' is the ratio between the value of the elements of constant capital involved in production and the value of the labor. Marx found that the special concept of 'organic composition of capital' was sometimes useful in analysis, since it assumes that the relative values of all the elements of capital are constant. Hence, he starts Chapter 25 of Vol. I with: (Marx & Engels Collected Works, Vol. 35, 607-8). It should be kept in mind that in Book I of Capital, Marx made the simplifying assumption that all valuation was in terms of what is often called labor-values (and he called 'values'). In Book III, however, he showed that in capitalism the equilibrium values could not be his 'values'. The latter were only equilibrium values in his pre-capitalist 'Simple Commodity Production', where the producers owned their means of production and natural resources were used freely. In Book III, first he assumed that land could be used freely and showed that the equilibrium prices were his 'prices of production'. Later, when he introduced land ownership and the rent on land, the equilibrium prices were to be 'modified production prices' that took the rent of land into account. The implication of this is that the valuation used for the 'value composition of capital' had to be accordingly modified, since the labor-values used throughout Book I was an expedient he used in order to not excessively complicate the communication of this theory. But Marx was not able to complete to his satisfaction Books II and III. The various distinct concepts related to the composition of capital are often used in contemporary Marxian economics as a theoretical alternative to similar neo-classical concepts. The neoclassical concept most similar to the increasing organic composition of capital is capital deepening. Marx's concept of constant capital is the monetary value of the plant, equipment and materials that are tied up in the production process. And his concept of variable capital is the money value that is tied up in the payment of wages. The concept of OCC does not apply to all capital assets, only to those invested in production (i.e. it excludes assets that are in the 'sphere of consumption', such as homes). In Capital Vol. 3 Marx demonstrates that the organic composition of capital decisively influences industrial profitability. According to Marx, the OCC expresses the specific form which the capitalist mode of production gives to the relationship between means of production and labor power, determining the productivity of labor and the creation of a surplus product. This relationship has both technical and social aspects, reflecting the fact that simultaneously consumable use values and commercial exchange-values are being produced. Marx argues that a rising organic composition of capital is a necessary effect of capital accumulation and competition in the sphere of production, at least in the long term. This means that the share of constant capital in the total capital outlay increases, and that labor input per product unit declines. In his discussion, Marx leaves out of account components of capital other than labour-power and means of production invested in, such as the faux frais of production (incidental expenses). The full importance of the OCC emerges in chapter 8 of the third volume of Das Kapital. Ratios The value composition of capital (VCC) is usually expressed as a ratio of constant capital to variable capital, or {c \\\\over v}. Other measures are also used in the Marxian literature. One is {c \\\\over {s+v}}. This is the ratio of constant capital to newly produced value (roughly, what modern economists call \\"value added\\"), i.e., surplus-value + variable capital and close to the concept of a capital/output ratio. Less common is the measure used by Paul M. Sweezy, i.e., {c \\\\over {c+v}}, the ratio of constant capital to the total capital invested. The total capital tied up by a capitalist enterprise includes more than fixed assets, materials and wages/salaries; it also includes liquid funds, reserves and other financial assets. For instance, an employer must normally reserve funds to pay for ongoing operating expenses, until these are recouped from product sales. Measures An empirical proxy measure for the technical composition of capital (TCC) is the average amount of fixed equipment and materials used per worker (capital intensity), or the ratio of the average amount of equipment & materials used to the total hours worked. The value composition of capital (VCC) is usually measured by summing the value of fixed capital (\\"Cf\\") and intermediate expenditures (circulating capital or \\"Cc\\") and dividing the total by the value of labour costs (V). The estimation procedure is not simple, for example because compensation of employees includes more than wages and part of the tax levy constitutes an element of surplus value. In modern national accounts, an empirical proxy of the flow of variable capital is the wage- payments associated with productive activity in an accounting period, and a proxy for constant capital (flow measure) is depreciation charges + intermediate consumption; a stock measure of constant capital would be the fixed capital stock plus the average value of inventories held during the period of account (usually a year). However, because the \\"circulating\\" component of constant capital (denoted \\"Cc\\") includes purchases of external services and other operating costs, the stock of Cc is sometimes measured as the flow of intermediate consumption divided by the average inventory level. The variable capital actually tied up by an enterprise at any point in time will usually be less than the annual flow value, because wages can in part be paid out of revenues received from ongoing product sales. Thus, the capital reserves held by an enterprise for paying wages may, at any time, be only 1/10 or so of their annual flow value. The most accurate quantitative estimates for the OCC refer to the outlays in specific sectors, e.g. manufacturing. Examples By any of these measures, the plant- and machinery-intensive oil industry would have a high organic composition of capital, while labor- intensive businesses such as catering would tend to have a low OCC. The OCC varies according to differences in production technology, between sectors of an economy, or according to changes in production technology over time. The OCC and crises The magnitude of the OCC is important in Marxist crisis theory because of its impact on the average rate of profit. The implication of a rise in the organic composition of capital is a declining rate of profit; for every new increase in surplus-value realised as profit from sales, an even larger corresponding increase in constant capital investment becomes necessary. But this represents only a tendency, Marx argues, because the fall of the rate of profit can be offset by counteracting influences. The main ones include: *buying constant capital inputs at a lower cost. *an increase in the rate of exploitation and productivity of labour power (including the intensity of work). *a reduction of the turnover-time of constant capital inputs. *the reduction of salaries and labour costs paid. *a pool of abundant cheap labor, at home or abroad. *foreign trade which reduces constant capital-input costs. *technological innovations which reduce constant capital-input costs. *the specific distribution of surplus-value as profit, interest, rent, taxes and fees, and the division between distributed and undistributed components of the new value added. *market expansion (more sales, in less time). *monopolistic or oligopolistic pricing of outputs, or in some way artificially raising output prices. *reduction of the tax burden *criminal methods to reduce costs and increase sales and profits Because numerous different factors can affect profitability, the overall effects of a rising OCC on average industrial profitability therefore really have to be evaluated empirically in a longer time-span, e.g. 20‚Äì25 years. Insofar as the trajectory of capitalist development is, as Marx argues, ruled by the quest for extra surplus-value, the economic fate of the system can be summarised as an interaction between the tendency of the profit rate to decline, and the factors that counteract it: in other words, the permanent battle to reduce costs, increase sales and increase profits. The hypothetical final result of the rising OCC would be full automation of the production process, in which case labour-costs would be near-zero. This is argued to herald the end of capitalism's functioning as both a profit generating economic system for capitalists, and as a social system, among other things because the capitalist system does not contain a means for distributing incomes other than that based on labour-effort, and full automation would negate the concept of exploitation. However, it is also possible that automation of material production displaces labour into the services sector. Provided sufficient income exists to purchase services, a service economy can grow. Marx and Ricardo The different organic compositions of capital of different branches of industry raised a problem for the classical economic schema of David Ricardo and others, who could not reconcile their labor-cost theory of price with the existence of differences in the OCC between sectors. The latter imply different profit rates in different industries. Also, while market competition would establish a ruling price level for a type of output, different enterprises would use more or less labour to produce it. For these reasons, values produced and prices realised by different producers would quantitatively diverge. Marx either solved this problem with his theory of prices of production and the tendency for profitability differentials to be levelled out through competition, or he failed to solve it, according to which side of the debate over the transformation problem one finds convincing. Others see this \\"problem\\" (the development of a mathematical relationship between prices and labor-values) as a false one, rejecting the idea that Marx aimed to use his labor theory value to understand relative prices. Here the argument is that he aimed to reveal only the social nature or \\"deep structure\\" of capitalist society. In a third interpretation, Marx aspired both to relate values and prices, and offer a social critique, because both of these were necessary to make his case truly convincing. Here, the separate concepts of product-values and product-prices are regarded as essential for a theory of market dynamics and capitalist competition; it is argued that price behaviour in aggregate cannot be understood or theorised about at all without reference to value-relations, explicitly or implicitly. Historical trends There has been a lengthy theoretical and statistical dispute among Marxian economists about whether the organic composition of capital really does tend to, or has to rise historically, as Marx predicted, or, to put it differently, whether in aggregate technological progress has a \\"labor-saving bias\\", and causes the average profit rate to decline. One sort of question asked is, why capitalists would introduce new technology, if doing so would result specifically in a lower profit rate on capital invested? Marx's reply is essentially that: *when a successful new technology or product is first introduced on the market, the pioneering producers typically obtain an additional profit (or superprofit), but when the use of the innovation spreads and is more generally applied, profitability declines for all producers. *competition between capitalists forces the introduction of new technologies, whether they like it or not, since the productivity gains of competitors threaten to put them out of business, or reduce their market-shares. *while average profit rates on capital invested may decline as a result, profit margins (or profit volumes) will increase, because more output can be produced and sold in a given accounting period, using the new technologies (implying unit-costs for products made will decline). The statistical and historical evidence about the Kondratiev waves of capitalist development from the 1830s onwards is certainly favourable to Marx's theory of the rising organic composition of capital. It is difficult to find industries where the secular historical trend is one of an increase in the share of wages in the total capital outlay. Generally, the opposite is the case. However, it has been argued that the value of physical capital is notoriously difficult to measure empirically in an accurate way; and statistical time-series for economic variables over long periods are also susceptible to errors and distortions. The owners of a business may not even know exactly what the physical assets they use are currently worth, or what their business is currently worth, as a going concern. That worth is hypothetical until such time as the business is sold and paid for. However, the modern trend in official accounting standards is certainly for assets to be valued more and more at their current market value, or current replacement cost, rather than at historic (original acquisition) cost. In addition, during severe economic slumps, physical capital assets are subject to devaluation, lie idle or are destroyed, while workers become unemployed; the empirical effect is to reduce the organic composition of capital. Likewise, non- profitable war production can also lower the average OCC. Finally, a technological revolution can also radically change the proportions between constant and variable capital, reducing the cost of constant capital, and lowering the OCC. In that case, operating costs are reduced in a short span of time, or cheaper alternatives substitute for the inputs traditionally used. Much less discussed in the economic literature is the effect on the organic composition of capital of the growth of the services sector in the developed countries. For example, does the widespread use of computers in labour- intensive services lower the OCC?

It was also the name of the military insignia carried by such unit. Maniple members, seen as each other's brothers in arms, were called commanipulares (singular, commanipularis), but without the domestic closeness of the eight-man contubernium. They would go on to be replaced by the cohorts following the Marian reforms. History The manipular system was adopted around 315 BC, during the Second Samnite War. The rugged terrain of Samnium, where the war was fought, was not conducive to the phalanx formation which the Romans had inherited from the Etruscans and Ancient Greeks. The main battle troops of the Etruscans and Latins of this period comprised Greek-style hoplite phalanxes, inherited from the original Greek phalanx military unit. After suffering a series of defeats, culminating in the surrender of the entire army without resistance at Caudine Forks, the Romans abandoned the phalanx altogether, adopting the more flexible manipular system, famously referred to as \\"a phalanx with joints\\". The manipular system was abandoned during the Marian reforms that began in 107 BC. It was replaced by the cohort unit. Structure The maniple typically consisted of 120 soldiers arrayed in 3 ranks of 40 men when engaged in battle. Polybius first described the maniple in the mid-second century BC. The manipular legion was organized into four lines, starting at the front: the velites, the hastati, the principes, and the triarii. These were divided by experience, with the younger soldiers at the front lines and the older soldiers near the back. One theory proposed by J. E. Lendon asserts that this order was adapted to the Roman culture of bravery, allowing an initial show of individual heroics among the younger soldiers. At the front of the legion organized into maniples, the velites formed a swarm of soldiers which engaged the enemy at the start of the battle. The second and third echelon generally formed with a one maniple space between each maniple and its neighbours. Retreating troops of the velites could withdraw without disrupting those behind them. Where resistance was strong the hastati would dissolve back through the Roman line and allow the more experienced soldiers in the principes to fight. In turn, the principes could yield to the hardened triarii if necessary. At this point in battle the maniple greatly resembled the phalanx. The hastati were the youngest and least experienced soldiers, and therefore fought on the front-lines. The principes were more experienced soldiers who stood behind the hastati in battle. Finally, the triarii were the veteran soldiers with the most experience. According to Polybius, the most complete and likely the most accurate account, the legion consisted of 10 maniples of 120 hastati, 10 maniples of 120 principes and 10 half strength maniples of triarii containing 60 men each. With 1,200 velites and 300 cavalrymen a legion numbered 4,500 men. However, in times of great need the number might be reinforced up to 5,000.

It borders the Pacific Ocean on the west; the Lima Region on the north; the Huancavelica and Ayacucho regions on the east; and the Arequipa Region on the south. Its capital is the city of Ica. Geography The Department of Ica has a remarkable geography. It is the only region of the southern coast formed by plains, also called coast plains, since the Andean Cordillera rise up inland. Some geological folds have determined the formation of dunes moving toward the sea, which form much of the Paracas Peninsula. Some isolated formations located at the southern part created the Marcona complex, with the biggest deposits of iron in the Pacific coast. Ica's configuration is due to the geomorphology of its two big and unique fluvial watersheds: the Pasco and Ica rivers. Also, it has a waterway called the Rio Grande, although its waters do not reach the ocean. Some waters are diverted for irrigation and agriculture in the provinces of Palpa, Nazca and Ingenio; the Rio Grande's final riverbed is dry since sand and dried lands absorb its limited resources. There are extensive deserts in Ica, such as the Lancha Pampas. Pozo Santo and Villacuri pampas are extremely hot areas. Strong and persistent winds called paracas are present and stir up large sandstorms. History Ica has a rich history. The first settlers are from 10,000 years ago, from which the Wari, Chincha, Nazca, Ica and Paracas cultures developed, the latter being the most important. The Paracas culture developed from the seventh through the 2nd century BC. It is distinguished by its matchless textile skills, trephinations, and the art of mummifying their dead. The Nazca culture, on the contrary, well known for its artistic pottery, in which colorful designs and representations excel over the form, the same as their lines and figures that have undergone implausible interpretations. This culture expanded from the 2nd century BC through the 7th century AD. They have left us their wonderful aqueducts that made good use of underground water, of rivers and rain, showing a great knowledge of hydraulic engineering. In the 15th century, during the Inca empire, Pachacuti incorporated the territories of Ica, Nazca and the Chincha valley. Years later, in 1563, with the arrival of the Spanish, Jer√≥nimo Luis de Cabrera founded the Villa de Valverde del Valle de Ica. Since then, the area became an important vineyard and cotton center. During the independence war, General Jos√© de San Mart√≠n landed in Paracas and fixed his headquarters in Pisco, to start the fight for the independence of Peru. Political division Map of the Ica region showing its provinces The region is divided into five provinces (, singular: ), which are composed of 43 districts (distritos, singular: distrito). Provinces The provinces, with their capitals in parentheses, are: *Chincha (Chincha Alta) *Ica (Ica) *Nazca (Nazca) *Palpa (Palpa) *Pisco (Pisco) Points of interest Nazca Lines: figure of the Spider.

A very modern clean city that has Peruvian street markets, many old churches and landmarks, modern malls, hotels, coffee shops, theatres, and hotels as well.  Huacachina Located on the west side of the city of Ica, capital of the Ica Department. One of the most popular places to visit in Ica is La Huacachina. The desert oasis is located from Ica. It is a small lake with medicinal water, lying in the middle of a spectacular sand desert. Pisco Pisco is the most important port in Ica and a litoral province. The most important attractions within this province are likely Paracas, Paracas Bay and the Paracas National Reserve. Pisco was home of an ancient pre-Hispanic culture, Paracas, who are known for their exquisite textiles. Paracas Paracas (a municipality within the Paracas District) is a small town catering to tourism. It serves as the jumping point for tours to Islas Ballestas and to Paracas National Reservation. Paracas Bay, protected by Paracas Peninsula, gives these shallow, warmer waters break from ocean waves permitting life to flourish, particularly near its south western edge encompassed within Paracas National Reserve. The Paracas Museum, also found just near the south western edge of Paracas Bay, provides excellent information about Paracas culture and the many unique species, in particular, the birds of Paracas. Nazca The Ica-Nazca culture flourished along the southern coast of Peru from around 200 BC to 600 AD. This area is extremely dry. The Nazca developed extensive irrigation systems, including underground canals, that allowed them to farm the land. The Nazca are known for their textiles and pottery which feature images of animals and mythological beings. They are even better known, however, for a unique set of creations known as the Nazca Lines, which are geoglyphs and geometric line clearings in the Atacama desert, in the district of Nazca. On a large, rock- strewn plain, the Nazca made huge drawings by scraping away stones to reveal the lighter soil underneath. The drawings depict various plants and animals, including humans, a monkey, birds, and other creatures, as well as lines and geometric shapes. These drawings are so huge, however, that they can be seen only from the sky. Scientists believe that the Nazca made these drawings for their gods. The area of the Nazca lines is called the Pampa Colorada (red plain). Cachiche A small village near Ica, Cachiche is well known for its history of witches.

It was opened in 1822 and was initially successful, but the construction of railways, particularly the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, which opened in 1842, diminished its value as a transport medium. It fell into slow commercial decline and was closed to commercial traffic in 1933. It was officially closed in 1965. The canal is listed as three individual scheduled monuments by Historic Scotland according to the three former counties, Midlothian, West Lothian and Stirlingshire, through which it flows. It has benefited from a general revival of interest in canals and, as a result of the Millennium Link, was reopened in 2001 and reconnected to the Forth and Clyde Canal in 2002 by the Falkirk Wheel. It is now in popular use for leisure purposes. The eastern terminus at Edinburgh Quay Avon Aqueduct History Proposal The canal was conceived with the purpose of moving minerals from the mines and quarries in Lanarkshire to Edinburgh. In 1817, the Edinburgh and Glasgow Union Canal Company obtained a Private Act of Parliament to start construction. Joseph Priestley described the purpose of the canal in his 1831 book Historical Account of the Navigable Rivers, Canals and Railways of Great Britain: > The primary object of this navigation was to effect an inland communication > between the cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow; to the former of which it must > be essentially serviceable, in consequence of the increased facilities > afforded to the transit of lime, coal, stone, &c.; which abound in its > course. This undertaking was designed by Mr. Thomas Telford and Mr. Baird, > who estimated the cost at ¬£240,468, 17s. 2d.; of which sum ¬£198,650 was > subscribed before going to parliament. The first act of parliament ... is > entitled, 'An Act for making and maintaining a navigable Canal from the > Lothian Road, near the city of Edinburgh, to join the Forth and Clyde > Navigation near Falkirk, in the county of Stirling.' The company of > proprietors consisted, at the time the first act was obtained, of three > hundred and eighty-four persons, amongst whom were the Lord Provost of > Edinburgh, Sir William Forbes, Sir John Hay, and Sir John Marjoribanks, who > were incorporated by the name of \\"The Edinburgh and Glasgow Union Canal > Company,\\" with power to raise ¬£240,500, in four thousand eight hundred and > ten shares, of ¬£50 each, and a further sum of ¬£50,000, either among > themselves, by the admission of new subscribers, or on mortgage of the > undertaking. The estimate of cost was evidently inadequate because a second Act authorised the borrowing of ¬£48,100, a third Act of 1821 authorised an increase in share capital of a further ¬£50,000 and a fourth authorised a further ¬£60,000. However, when the Union Canal got its Act, the town of Linlithgow, along with Edinburgh, mounted a legal petition for compensation for any losses they would incur from the turnpike that ran between Glasgow and Edinburgh. Their writ read: > The Company are directed to indemnify the Magistrates and Town Council of > the Royal Burgh of Linlithgow for any Diminution of the Customs upon Cattle, > Carriages, or Goods carried over the Avon at Torphichan Mill; also to secure > to the Magistrates and Town Council of the City of Edinburgh the Rate of One > Penny per Ton on all Goods, Wares, or other Things (except Manure,) shipped > or unloaded at any of the Wharfs and Basins, in lieu of certain Rates, Dues, > Causeway, Mail, and Petty Customs, which they are now entitled to; as it > appears that, by a Charter or Gift of Charles the First, dated 17 May 1636, > the Ministers of Edinburgh are entitled to a Duty or Custom of Thirteen > Shillings and Four-pence Scots, upon each Ton or Pack of Goods imported to > Edinburgh, Leith, or Newhaven. The Company are therefore directed to pay the > same on all Goods which may be imported by this Navigation. They are also > bound to indemnify the Edinburgh Road Trustees, the Bathgate, and another > Trust, in any Diminution of Tolls arising from these Turnpike Roads, which > may be affected by their Canal. Construction & design Map of the Union Canal The Union Canal, which has a length of today, was built as a contour canal. This avoided building costs and future operational delays caused by the provision of locks but necessitated large aqueducts to cross river valleys. The canal operated between a junction with the Forth and Clyde Canal at Falkirk and Port Hopetoun basin in the centre of Edinburgh. The waterway, which was originally , follows a contour of above sea level throughout its entire length. Port Hopetoun was a basin between Semple Street and Lothian Road, and Morrison Street and Fountainbridge. However, the final mile has been filled in and the Edinburgh terminal is now at Lochrin Basin in Tollcross, adjacent to Fountainbridge. The canal has several navigable aqueducts, including the Slateford Aqueduct that takes the canal over the Water of Leith in Edinburgh, the Almond Aqueduct near Ratho and the Avon Aqueduct near Linlithgow, the second-longest in the United Kingdom. Priestley describes the route and structures in some detail: > [The] Canal commences from the sixteenth lock of the Forth and Clyde > Navigation, about two miles west of Falkirk, in the county of Sterling , > whence it takes an eastwardly course on the south side of the above- > mentioned town, by some collieries; thence, through Black Hill Tunnel, and > across the Glen Water, on which stream, at a short distance to the > southward, is constructed a considerable reservoir. Its line hence is by > Brighton Freestone Quarries, and about a mile [] north from Park Hill > Colliery, to the Avon River, over which there is an aqueduct conveying the > canal at an elevation of above the surface of the river. The canal here > enters the county of Linlithgow, and passes within a mile and a half [] on > the south side of its capital, to Craighton House, where its course is more > southerly and circuitous, to the River Almond, near Clifton House, where it > crosses into Edinburghshire, by means of an aqueduct. Its course hence is by > Ratho House, and across Leith River, to the city of Edinburgh, where it > terminates by a basin at the Lothian Road, about half a mile [] south-west > of the castle. The length of the canal is , the depth of water , and is on > one level from Edinburgh to its western extremity, where it falls , in one > series of locks, into the Forth and Clyde Canal. Many of the stone bridges have keystones on which is engraved the number of the bridge: the keystones of Viewforth bridge, the second bridge from the start of the canal at Edinburgh Quay, are emblazoned with the coats of arms of Glasgow and Edinburgh, facing west and east respectively. The income from the project was derived from tolls, and charges for wharfage and so on. Maximum prices for these were laid down in the Act. The tolls were based on tonnage of the merchandise being conveyed; there was a toll for empty vessels, and this was to be remitted if the vessel returned laden within fourteen days. Closure and demise  Flight of locks at Falkirk on an old map In 1842 the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway opened taking much of the traffic away from the canal with passenger traffic effectively disappearing. Although the waterway was still used to transport industrial minerals to Edinburgh, goods requiring more haste were put on to trains. The canal was acquired by the E&GR; in 1849. Industrial traffic continued to use the waterway until after the First World War. However, with the closure of Port Hamilton and Port Hopetoun (the main basins in Edinburgh) in 1921, commercial traffic steadily declined. In 1933, just over a hundred years since its opening, the Union Canal was officially closed to commercial traffic. In the 1960s, the abandoned flight of 11 locks at Falkirk, which connected the Union to the Forth and Clyde, was filled in. The canal was culverted for the Wester Hailes housing development in the western outskirts of Edinburgh and for the M8 motorway near Broxburn. Formal closure came in 1965 and throughout the 1970s and 1980s the canal was left in a deteriorated state. However, after a campaign was started by groups and local communities to improve the canal, work was carried out to restore the network during the 1990s. This culminated with the millennium project to reinstate the link between the Union Canal to the Forth and Clyde Canal with a boat lift called the Falkirk Wheel. Archaeology Shandon and Polwarth Wooden barge during excavationPlan of the barge In 2004, an archaeological investigation by a team from Headland Archaeology uncovered the stern of a wooden barge. The vessel was discovered on the south bank of the canal between the Leamington Lift Bridge and Viewforth Bridge in Edinburgh. The remains represent the final berth of an early- to mid-19th-century canal barge or scow, a type of horse-drawn vessel that was the main freight carrier of the time. Typical cargoes included coal and lime from Lanarkshire, although there were a number of passenger carriers too; the actual function of this vessel is unknown. The vessel was dismantled and removed from the canal in order to record the techniques used in its construction. Additional work will seek to identify the species, age and provenance of the timbers. Millennium Link The Millennium Link was a project to restore a link between the Union and Forth and Clyde Canals at the Falkirk end. In 2002 the Falkirk Wheel opened reestablishing this historic connection. The scheme involved building a new stretch of canal, single and double locks and a short tunnel under the Edinburgh‚ÄìGlasgow railway line and the Antonine Wall. Several new bridges were also built on the Millennium Link. As no CAD information was available on narrowboats, the motion of articulated lorries were used to design the bends of the bridge approaches. Leisure uses Students picnic on the Union Canal in 1922. The canal is now used recreationally by canoeists at the Forth Canoe Club and rowers from schools and universities, such as St Andrew Boat Club, George Heriots School Rowing Club and George Watsons College Rowing Club. The Edinburgh Canal Society, the Bridge 19-40 Canal Society and Linlithgow Union Canal Society promote general use of the canal. They hire rowing boats and narrowboats, and they provide regular boat trips on the canal for the general public. Re-Union Canal Boats operate a social enterprise building and maintaining trip boats. Scottish Canals (as successor to the British Waterways Board in Scotland) have redeveloped the area at the Edinburgh terminal; their publicity states: > Edinburgh Quay is a major regeneration project centred on the site of > Lochrin Basin, in the heart of Scotland's capital. It provides around 90 > waterfront apartments, of offices and of retail and restaurant space. Raft races have become an annual event, having been held in Edinburgh from 2007 to 2011, and using found \\"junk\\" material for the rafts. The Linlithgow Union Canal Society has been hosting its cardboard boat race for many years at Linlithgow Basin.  2020 Canal Breach  In the early morning of Wednesday the 12th of August 2020, slow-moving thunderstorms caused torrential rain over much of eastern Scotland, including in the Falkirk area. This heavy rainfall caused the Union Canal to overtop its embankment east of Polmont, producing a 30 meter wide breach in the canal. The floodwaters released from the breach caused significant damage to the main railway line from Glasgow to Edinburgh via Falkirk High, Scotlands busiest railway line.

The player is manifested in Noctis as the pilot of spacecraft called a Stardrifter, capable of instantaneous interstellar travel. This allows travelling between stars, refuelling the Stardrifter from Lithium ion-ejecting stars, approaching planets in star systems and their moons, and even landing where it is physically possible. Many planets feature atmospheres and weather effects. Some harbour plants and animals, or even mysterious ruins. No goal or measure of success is imposed by the game: it simply allows the player to catalogue and annotate the player's discoveries in a common database of stellar bodies called the GUIDE, which is to be synchronised over the author's Internet server.  Gameplay  The Noctis galaxy, Feltyrion, is approximately 90 thousand light-years in radius, approximately double the radius of the Milky Way Galaxy. With the exception of landing on some world types (being gas giants, Substellar Objects, and unstable worlds), this galaxy is entirely open to be explored. Billions of worlds can be explored despite the program's relatively small size, due to its content being generated on the fly. The Noctis universe contains several types of planets and 12 types of stars, noted in-game with an S in front of the number of the star.  History  The Italian programmer Alessandro Ghignola began creating Noctis in 1996. Noctis versions I-IV were written in C and Assembly. Ghignola worked also on a new version (to be released as Noctis V) in his original low-level programming language, called Linoleum. Noctis I through III, still available on the AnywhereBB website, contain features that were abandoned with later releases.  Noctis IV, NICE  Noctis was originally based on DOS and uses a fixed display resolution of 320 x 200, and an upper limit imposed on the walking distance from a planetary landing site. (This does not restrict the player's ability to explore the planet, because they can freely take off and land elsewhere.) These limitations do not apply to the Noctis galaxy because it contains over 78 billion stars, most of which host many planets and moons orbiting them. The current version of the game is called Noctis IV. In the release of Noctis IV, Ghignola included a facility to have planet names and notes sent back to him and then compiled into a central database of information called the GUIDE. People playing the simulator (also called Stardrifters) could then share their findings with others, and a community of explorers soon developed (on the Noctis forums) around that, vying for a wide range of discoveries, such as the planetary system with the most planets or the biggest tree in the Noctis universe. This is the only way to interact with other players, since Noctis, being a single-player game (not including other Stardrifters summoned in the game, which are NPCs), has a protagonist who does not speak. For some time Ghignola regularly compiled a new GUIDE based on emailed submissions of players of their \\"Outbox\\" and allowed the compilation to be downloaded as an \\"Inbox\\". While the GUIDE has not been updated for several years since 2005, since December 2008 the service has been restored again. A more automatic system of \\"massively single-player\\" content sharing is used in 2008's Spore. The source code for Noctis IV was released to the public in 2003 under the WTOF Public License,license which has led to the creation of a fan-made \\"mod\\" to the game called Noctis IV CE (commonly abbreviated NICE). NICE includes bug fixes and additional features which increase the playability compared to Noctis IV. The terrain generation code has also been altered in the NICE version, which means that remarks made in the Noctis IV GUIDE are largely invalid for NICE.  Future version (Noctis V)  A future version of Noctis (tentatively named Noctis V or Noctis NoVa) is currently under development. Development of the project began on 11 October 2001. Noctis V (sometimes abbreviated as NoVa) promises to relieve the restrictions of the current Noctis platform, as described above. This is because the new version of Noctis is being developed in Linoleum (which Ghignola has developed himself), a low-level programming language that is currently being shaped to better suit Noctis. To paraphrase the official Noctis webpage: Linoleum and Noctis have evolved together. However, this also results in a slowdown of the program's development. Screenshots and details have been revealed by the developer and it is thought that the rendering engine has been completely redone from scratch, Ghignola first having attempted to simply translate the Noctis IV engine into Linoleum, before giving up and rewriting it. Ghignola has also mentioned experimenting with weather and particle effects, possibly things like snow and dust storms. There is no set release date for Noctis V, but Ghignola has repeatedly assured the game community that he has not given up on the project, and has no intention of doing so. The most recent assurance was in a May 9, 2012 interview with Videogame Porpourri, where Ghignola stated \\"[Noctis V] keeps living in a corner of my mind, on a sort of unwritten post- it note. But it's there, ready to strike as soon as it gets an opportunity to incarnate.\\"  Reception  The game gained popularity in early 2000 after receiving a very favourable review in Home of the Underdogs's list of worthwhile free games.Noctis on Hotu Noctis earned a score of 9.43 out of 10 as well as the site's \\"Top Dog\\" award. The reviewer noted amongst other things the magnitude of the galaxy to explore and the total size of the simulator, which is less than one megabyte. An in-detail article of The Escapist's Phillip Scuderi noted the philosophical depth of Noctis in 2006.

Created by writer Michael Malone, the role was originated in 1992 by actor Roger Howarth. Todd was a college student and fraternity brother to Kevin Buchanan, Zach Rosen, and Powell Lord. In 1993, following a storyline in which he becomes acquainted with Marty Saybrooke, he initiates a gang rape on her with the help of Zach and Powell. The storyline was considered groundbreaking by television critics. Its main players‚ÄîHowarth, Susan Haskell (Marty), and Hillary B. Smith (Todd's lawyer Nora Hanen)‚Äîwon Emmys in 1994, as did Malone and his writing team. Howarth left the role in 2003; it was recast with Trevor St. John, physically altered by plastic surgery. In 2011, Howarth returned to OLTL; it was disclosed Todd had been taken hostage and St. John's version of the character was really Todd's identical twin brother, Victor Lord, Jr., conditioned to assume Todd's place. Todd was initially a short-term villain, but his popularity with the audience and critics inspired the writers to forgo killing him or permanently sending him to prison, like most soap operas had done with rapists in the past. While keeping aspects of his personality dark or violent, they had Todd exhibit a conscience and compassion. They took steps to redeem him and made him an integral part of OLTL canvas, despite Howarth's objections to a redemption storyline. With the use of literary techniques for the redemptive arc, the writers borrowed from nineteenth-century melodrama and Gothic traditions, and literature such as Frankenstein. Todd became the product of an affair between his father, Victor Lord, and his mother, Irene Manning, which provided him a fortune and ties to other major characters, including his sisters, Tina and Victoria Lord. An important aspect of the character became his appearance, most notably the scar on his right cheek, which emerged as synonymous with him and served to remind him of his past misdeeds against Marty. Music and the use of humor were also key to Todd's development. Although he formed many relationships (including with his wives, Blair Cramer and T√©a Delgado), and fathered children, a defining characteristic of his personality was his resistance to close relationships and sexual intimacy. The drive to redeem Todd eventually drew Howarth, who always saw Todd as a villain, to leave the show for a year; he was uncomfortable with the redemption storyline and with many fans' positive reactions to Todd. Recasting Todd years later with St. John was generally considered successful by viewers and critics. St. John, instead of imitating Howarth's portrayal, brought his own spin to the character. After OLTL cancellation in 2012, Howarth brought Todd to General Hospital (GH), but returned, along with St. John as Victor Jr., to the online version of OLTL in 2013, which was cancelled after one year. Todd has been the subject of numerous soap opera articles, feminist studies, and inspired the creation of a doll in his likeness. He has remained a popular and controversial figure since his creation, and is considered one of soap opera's breakout characters. Storylines  1992‚Äì2003  In 1992, Todd, a defensive back for Llanview, Pennsylvania University's football team, has a one-night stand with Marty Saybrooke (Susan Haskell), a wild child. After she tutors him for a calculus exam and he fails it, which results in him getting suspended from the football team, he blames her. In 1993, Todd and his fraternity brothers, Zach Rosen and Powell Lord, rape Marty in Kevin's dorm room. Todd hires attorney Nora Hanen (Hillary B. Smith), who believes in his innocence until a woman named Carol Swift reveals Todd also raped her; Nora causes a mistrial. Todd continues to torment Marty, including by attempting to rape her for a second time, but she eventually tricks Todd into confessing, sending him, Zach and Powell to prison. Per Marty's testimony that Powell, who was peer pressured into raping her, is remorseful, Powell receives a lighter sentence (one year with the possibility of parole in three months to Todd and Zach's eight years with the possibility of parole in four years). This spurs on Todd's need for revenge. While in prison, he befriends Rebecca Lewis (Reiko Aylesworth) and attends counseling sessions. Todd and Rebecca develop romantic feelings for each other, and Todd convinces Rebecca to help him escape prison. He is stabbed in the chest with a pair of scissors by Nora when he goes after her for revenge. Officer Bo Buchanan (Robert S. Woods), Nora's love interest, rescues her from Todd. The two fight, but Todd escapes. In hiding, he is discovered by Marty and her boyfriend, Suede Pruitt. After accidentally killing Suede when they fight, he is shot by Bo; Todd falls into the Llantano River, and is presumed dead. Todd survives and hides at Llanfair, where he befriends two children, C. J. and Sarah Roberts. He is arrested when he jealously confronts new couple Rebecca and Powell. His prison van gets into an accident with another vehicle, and he rescues Marty, C. J. and Jessica (Erin Torpey) from the car. This results in an early parole for Todd, but he continues to seek counseling. He is later accused of rape by several women. Marty reluctantly provides him with an alibi for one of the attacks. A deranged Powell, believing Todd is in his head, is later revealed as the serial rapist and kidnaps Rebecca. When Todd confronts him, making it so that Rebecca can escape, he kidnaps Todd and makes Todd feel the way Marty felt when they raped her. Todd proceeds to overpower Powell. After Powell is caught and arrested, Todd apologizes to Marty for all the pain he caused her, recognizing that he \\"was a monster.\\" He begins falling in love with Blair Cramer (Kassie DePaiva) after meeting her in a bar. In December 1994, Peter Manning dies and Todd learns he is adopted. Conman David Vickers (Tuc Watkins) discovers Todd's biological parents, Victor Lord and Irene Manning. With help from Todd's scheming biological sister, Tina, David claims to be the lost Lord heir, but Todd's true parentage is ultimately revealed, leaving Todd $27.8 million richer. He purchases a tabloid paper from Dorian Lord (Robin Strasser) and relaunches it as The Sun, a direct rival to his new-found family's newspaper The Banner. In 1995, Blair tricks Todd into marriage by faking a pregnancy. She later learns that she really is pregnant, but, after being mugged, she miscarries. Todd discovers she initially lied about her pregnancy and has the marriage annulled. When Blair becomes pregnant again, they remarry in November 1995. Although they are happy, Blair dislikes Todd's consistent concern for Marty. He goes to Ireland to give Marty a flight back to Llanview. Her friend, Patrick Thornhart (Thorsten Kaye), is being hunted by Irish terrorists. Todd poses as Patrick, is shot, and presumed dead. Blair blames Marty. Todd returns to Llanview in 1996, to find Blair in bed with Patrick. His sister, Victoria \\"Viki\\" Lord (Erika Slezak), introduces him to his daughter, Starr (Kristen Alderson). Todd eventually resumes his life with Blair. They have many difficulties in their marriage, and Starr being diagnosed with aplastic anemia strains the marriage further. Blair is pregnant with Patrick's baby, who has been identified as a donor match for Starr. She gives birth to his stillborn son in 1997. Todd blames Patrick for the miscarriage and frames him for the murder of billionaire and Llanview newcomer Guy Armitage. Blair learns that Todd caused the explosion that killed Guy, and divorces him in June. When Blair falls into a coma, Todd pays lawyer T√©a Delgado (Florencia Lozano) five million dollars to marry him so he can keep custody of Starr. When Blair awakens, he allows Blair visitation. In 1998, while Todd and T√©a grow closer, Todd is again accused of rape; Blair and Sam Rappaport (Kale Browne), a lawyer and father-figure to Todd, help prove his innocence. Back in town upon Todd's request, he also intends to help Todd save his tempestuous marriage to T√©a. In the interim, Todd and Blair grow closer, and Blair and T√©a vie for Todd's affections. As Todd and T√©a fall in love, Blair moves on with Sam. When Todd is about to be arrested for the murder of a woman named Georgie Phillips, he takes the other fourteen suspects hostage at the Buchanan family cabin with fake dynamite strapped to his chest. Rachel Gannon admits to the murder, but Todd is arrested for the hostage incident. He fakes dissociative identity disorder (split personalities) to avoid conviction and keep T√©a in his life. T√©a divorces him as part of his defense strategy, but they remarry in November. During the reception, a tape on which Todd confesses to faking his split personalities is accidentally played at Starr's request. T√©a refuses his offer of another five million to stay married to him. He leaves town in December, and Tea has the marriage annulled in 1999. In 2000, Todd keeps tabs on T√©a, who starts dating Rachel's uncle, R. J. (Timothy Stickney). Out of jeaously, he almost kills R. J. via a gunshot, and reveals himself to T√©a, convincing her to leave town with him. When T√©a dumps him, he returns months later without her. Todd and Blair grow close again. By framing Skye Chandler (Robin Christopher), he helps her cover up her rage-shooting of Max Holden (James DePaiva). They decide to remarry, but the night before the wedding, a vengeful Max drugs Blair and leads Todd to believe they had sex. A furious Todd exposes Blair as Max's shooter. After burying Max alive to discover the truth, and soon afterward releasing him, he helps Blair stay out of jail by claiming she suffered a psychotic break. She is committed against her will. Months later, she goes to Mexico, knowing that she is pregnant with Todd's child. Todd follows, where he delivers their son. Believing the child is Max's, he gives the baby to David Vickers, and lets Blair think the baby died and was cremated soon afterward. During her grief, she and Todd reconcile, and she finally tells Todd that the child was really his. Todd locates the infant and claims the boy was abandoned. Blair subsequently believes the child is a stranger. In December 2001, Todd convinces Blair to remarry him. They name their son John \\"Jack\\" Cramer Manning, and Todd makes it appear they have adopted him. Jack develops aplastic anemia like Starr. This ultimately leads Sam to deduce that they are biological siblings, and to inform Blair that Jack is her biological son. She angrily confronts Todd. When he admits that he gave Jack away and forced her to grieve for a child that was never dead, she classifies his existence as worthless and bans him from her life, which results in him being severely emotionally unstable. Blair leaves town with the children, but Todd follows her to Hawaii, where his plans to kidnap the children with help from Ross Rayburn (Shawn Christian) are foiled by T√©a. Todd and T√©a make love when they get stranded together on an island with Ross. Todd escapes to return to Blair, and protects her when the Mafia comes after her because of her expos√© on them in The Sun. As Todd and Blair are about to remarry, Sam discloses that Todd, in an effort to win Blair's affections, staged a hit on their nanny, who had been presumed dead as a result of the Mafia's retaliation. Todd had used the nanny's \\"death\\" as an excuse for Blair to stay with him, later staging a hit on Blair's life, with him as the rescuer. The wedding is called off, and Blair distances herself from Todd. Soon afterward, Mitch Laurence (Roscoe Born) kidnaps Starr. Blair exchanges her own life for her daughter's. Todd rescues Blair by kidnapping his niece, Natalie (Melissa Archer), and exchanging her life for Blair's. Mitch, working for the presumed dead Victor Lord, intends to steal a descendant's heart so he can live. Natalie is rescued, and Todd comes face to face with a frail Victor before he finally dies from heart failure. Mitch kidnaps Todd and locks him in Victor's crypt in order to frame him for Sam Rappaport's murder. Todd disappears from the crypt, and Blair eventually has him declared dead.  2011‚Äì2013 Todd's identical twin brother, Victor Lord, Jr. (Trevor St. John), whom he had never known, is physically altered and brainwashed to believe that he is Todd. From May 2003 to August 2011, he assumes Todd's identity. In 2003, the presumed dead Irene Manning had ordered a hit on the real Todd to keep him from exposing her agency. She had Todd strapped to a chair and made him uncover every detail of his life. She originally gave Victor Todd's scar, but then had Victor's face altered with reconstructive surgery to make him look like Mitch Laurence's long lost brother, Flynn Walker Laurence. Irene sent Victor away in Todd's place, so that he could get his share of the inheritance as Victor Lord Sr.'s heir, and unknowingly help the agency. She kept the real Todd locked up, instead of following through with the original plan to kill him. She eventually admits to these facts after Todd escapes and returns home. Todd struggles with losing eight years of his life, and blames Victor for stealing his children, including the daughter he had with T√©a, Danielle (Dani). He plans to kill Victor and is the top suspect when Victor is gunned down. He claims his innocence and convinces Starr to help him escape jail to keep Irene from killing the family for Victor's fortune. Although Irene wounds him, Todd kills her. T√©a's brother, Tom√°s (Ted King), takes credit for allowing a wounded Todd to escape. Todd begins having vivid memories of killing Victor. Before Tom√°s is sentenced, Todd confesses to Irene's murder; T√©a gets the charges reduced to self-defense. Todd locates the gun used to kill Victor and uses it to frame Tom√°s as revenge for initially bringing him to Irene. Todd and a rogue CIA agent force Tom√°s into a false confession. Todd faces difficulty bonding with Jack, who only accepts Victor as his father, but he continues to bond with Starr and assists her with various issues. He also helps Cole Thornhart fake his death so he can live with Starr and their daughter, Hope, in California. Todd is later arrested for Victor's murder. In 2012, Todd jumps bail and arrives in Port Charles upon learning that Starr has been involved in a car accident that resulted in the deaths of Cole and Hope. Todd thinks local mobster Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) is responsible for the deaths and seeks revenge. The charges against him for Victor's murder are dropped, due to a claim of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following his years in captivity, but Starr faces attempted murder charges for trying to kill Sonny. A pregnant T√©a, who has been sought out by Blair to represent Starr, gets the charges dropped. In June, Todd is with T√©a during an intense rainstorm when she goes into labor and gives birth to an unresponsive baby boy. Sam Morgan (Kelly Monaco) is also giving birth to a baby boy in a motel room. After Todd, searching for help, comes upon Heather Webber (Robin Mattson) in a shack, and she tells Todd that T√©a's baby has died, he comes across Sam's son. An elated T√©a sees the child and believes he is hers. Todd allows T√©a to believe the child is hers, after Heather talks him out of telling T√©a the truth. Todd forms a close relationship with Carly Corinthos (Laura Wright), Sonny's former wife, in the wake of yet another rejection from Blair, who is set to marry Tom√°s. Todd's role in the baby switch is eventually revealed. To make amends for almost killing her son, Steven, Heather lies to the judge and prosecutors about Todd's role in switching the babies. He is then released. In 2013, Todd returns to Llanview to check on Dani, who had previously phoned him several times. He witnesses Dani collapse from a drug overdose due to her abuse of oxycodone. While she is recovering at the hospital, an alive Victor arrives. A surprised T√©a, Dani, and Jack welcome Victor back, while Todd tries to bond with his children. Todd remains concerned about Jack and Dani, attempting to buy their affections with money and deciding the best way to win them over is to call a truce with Victor. He also tries to win back Blair's affections. He eventually admits he only pretended to get along with Victor to lure him into a false sense of security. Victor admits that he poisoned Todd's scotch with arsenic and then tried to strangle him. Jack takes Todd to the hospital, where he recovers but is frustrated when his family continues to defend Victor. Victor realizes he must leave town and says goodbye to his family. Todd shows Blair a threatening note he received with the names of all his loved ones on it. The mysterious Tattoo Organization that held Victor demands that Todd find and kill Victor. Todd, Blair and T√©a devise a scheme to fool this organization into believing Victor is dead. Feeling secure that their scheme has worked, they plan for a future. Todd receives another note by the Tattoo Organization, this time telling him that he failed them and that Victor has been recaptured. Todd is told that he must leave Llanview and go to the address given on the note. Todd and Blair are devastated. Todd says goodbye to Viki and his children, but does not tell them the real reason he is leaving is to protect their family. Before Todd leaves, he and Blair make love one last time, and it is revealed that they have remarried. Creation and development Background Todd was originally intended to be a short-lived role, but Howarth's portrayal of the character inspired notable fan reaction, which prompted the creators to layer Todd's personality and showcase him regularly within the series.Hayward, p. 175 Michael Malone, Todd's creator, said fleshing out the character reminded him of what he loved about soap operas, adding, \\"The story-telling is a genuine collaboration, not just among writers but by the actors.\\" Malone felt he could not take full credit for the development of Todd from Marty Saybrooke's gang rapist to what he later became, and also noted Howarth's impact: > In the creation of Todd Manning, no one played a larger role than the > remarkably talented Josh Griffith, first associate head writer, then co-head > writer, during my stay at One Life. Josh loved, lived and breathed Todd and > fought passionately for his position on the show. Second, Todd never would > have evolved from \\"first frat boy\\" to the major cast member he became > without the powerful talent of Roger Howarth. Because of Roger's ability to > convey the complexity of Todd (the hurt as well as anger, the insecurity as > well as bluster, the brains, yearning, manipulativeness, sexiness, > tenderness, nastiness) we were able to explore both the deeply dark side of > this character (the effort to destroy Marty to cover the rape, the attempted > revenge on his lawyer Nora, the attack on Luna) and at the same time slowly > uncover his growing struggle (usually a failed struggle) towards some kind > of redemption. Romantic leads have often begun their careers playing > villains (Valentino, Clark Gable, Humphrey Bogart among them). These > characters appeal because they make women feel both the thrill of the \\"bad\\" > and the lure of the hidden \\"good\\": they can lead the man to change through > love. \\"I'll save him!\\" Fans loved Todd from the beginning because he always > had that appeal. Malone originally scripted Todd as a serial rapist. As part of the 1993 rape storyline, it was disclosed that Todd raped a woman named Carol Swift, a year or two before raping Marty, and that there were hints he raped other young women before Carol. Howarth considered Todd's rationale for raping Marty to be complex. \\"Todd was in love with Marty,\\" he said. When Marty rejects Todd's romantic advances after their one-night stand, it is because he was cold to her that same night after they had sex. Marty's rejection upsets Todd and it festers. When he fails an exam after she tutors him, he blames her for the failure and begins attributing her as the reason for his problems. Howarth called Todd \\"privileged and very rich\\". Because Todd was used to getting what he wanted, he did not know how to cope with Marty rejecting him. Although Todd is the product of an affair between Victor Lord and Irene Manning, Malone gave him the last name \\"Manning\\" without knowing the name of Victor's mistress, an oversight that allowed the writers to later reveal him as Tina and Victoria Lord's brother. He is at first presented as 18 years old, but over the years, his age has been changed based upon the occasional rapid aging of his children. Malone stated that making Todd heir to the Lord fortune gave the writers \\"huge story\\" that helped Howarth's character evolve from a short-term role to a major cast member, which Malone attributed to Howarth's \\"powerful talent\\". Peter Manning, who Todd thought was his father, had died; Todd receives letters written by his adoptive mother disclosing that he is the Lord heir, and worth almost $30 million. Developing Todd not only as Victoria's unwanted sibling, whom she was horrified to discover was her blood, but as \\"her professional rival\\" who used \\"a splashy tabloid newspaper to wipe out her venerable\\" newspaper The Banner appealed to Malone. Executive producer Susan Bedsow Horgan, when speaking of Todd's psychological motivations, reported that Peter Manning degraded him verbally and abused his adoptive mother, whom Todd loved but who abandoned and disappointed him, leaving Todd with wounds that influenced his later behavior. Author Gerry Waggett stated that Peter Manning had physically abused Todd his entire life.Waggett, p. 47 Signature scar, hair and facial cues A young Howarth with Todd's vintage, long-haired look (left). A makeup artist applying Todd's scar to Howarth (right); the scar stretches in a curve across the character's right cheek, and appears a thin, medium red in its significantly healed version. In late 1993, in order to make Todd look more menacing, he was given a scar to his right cheek by Marty's friend, Luna Moody, when she hit him in his face with a crowbar while preventing his attempt to rape Marty for a second time. The camera would often close in on and emphasize Todd's scar, which later became synonymous with the character. To casting director Howard Meltzer, \\"Todd wears the scar like a badge. It's a warning to others: Don't mess with me.\\" Meltzer felt Howarth underplayed Todd; Todd did not have to rant to incite fear. Meltzer added: \\"He gets a lot more from the raising of an eyebrow than raising the volume of his voice. Most of Todd's performance is reacting to the environment around him, and thanks to Howarth's expressiveness, viewers can see the wheels turning.\\" The scar also served to remind Todd of his past villainy against Marty. It was applied by glue, with a little makeup to make it look more authentic, and usually took ten minutes to apply. Todd's long hair was also integral to the character. It was described by Soap Opera Magazine as \\"enigmatic, with an air of innate authority\\". The hair was said to demonstrate Todd's lack of pretense and to convey an \\"I don't care\\" attitude. Todd's \\"overhanging brow\\" seemed threatening, but instead concealed the \\"intense, vulnerable eyes underneath\\", features that contrasted well with the character's \\"pouty, sensual mouth\\". The features, which conferred \\"a charming, boyish quality\\", could sometimes convey that Todd was less dangerous than he actually was. Photographer Robert Milazzo believed Howarth's hair softened Todd's character. \\"You don't expect that intensity because of it,\\" he said, and felt that it made Todd more intriguing. Milazzo also stated that the combination of Todd's soft hair and intensity made Todd \\"a very complex character to look at\\". An interviewer concluded that Howarth was physically attractive and that this may have contributed to the character's magnetism. Howarth replied, \\"I know what the convention of a good- looking person is, and I know that for some reason skinny white guys are big now. I guess you could blame it on that.\\"\\"Roger Howarth‚ÄîThe Other Side of Evil\\" (April 5, 1994). Soap Opera Update. In November 2008, during St. John's portrayal of the character, Todd is given a new scar by John McBain during a physical altercation in which John beats Todd with a gun. The scar symbolized Todd's \\"second rape of Marty\\", and was considered \\"a poetic nod\\" to Todd's history. The scar was significantly smaller than the original but placed in the same spot; it was gone by January 2009. St. John stated, \\"I know. It's too bad. I honestly have no idea why they wouldn't keep that reminder on Todd's face. It might be an economical thing. You know it costs to apply that kind of makeup each day.\\" The most important aspect of Todd's appearance for St. John was his character's hair. His preference was that Todd's hair was a little shorter; he told Soap Opera Weekly (SOW) that he thought that Todd's hair was too \\"shaggy\\", which was not his personal style, and that he hoped the writers and producers would let him trim off a bit. When he first got the role, St. John's hair resembled Howarth's shorter chin-length haircut, which was initially worn from 2000 to 2003, and St. John was told by the writers and producers not to change his hair until further notice. St. John \\"made the creative choice [to let himself] go because [Todd's] not really right in the old noggin, and gained weight for the role. \\"Todd's theme\\" and related music Composer David Nichtern, who wrote much of One Life to Live's music for Todd One Life to Live's producers stated that most of the show's music was custom written, suitable for the situation and what the characters in the scene might actually play. For Todd, his volatile nature was represented with powerfully dark theme music, which producers and fans called the \\"Todd theme\\". The music consisted of ominous low chords and signaled that Todd was about to commit a vicious, dangerous, or threatening act. Composer David Nichtern, who created Todd's theme music, said he loved the character and enjoyed implementing the different versions of the Todd theme. While describing the music that marked Todd's prominent 1996 \\"return from the dead\\" storyline (which documented his return to town after being presumed dead), Nichtern addressed the broader aspect of his composition for the character: \\"All of Todd's music has had a certain 'vibe' to it, especially since the character is so well-drawn,\\" he stated. \\"It also has seemed particularly well-suited to my guitar style, so I've enjoyed 'becoming' Todd musically. The key is always to represent his dark side, but with the possibility of redemption and power behind the whole thing.\\" Nichtern added, \\"That's what makes him such an interesting character. Todd's cues are always custom-made so to speak, so there is energy and attention going toward getting the exact flavor of what the current story-line is saying about his journey.\\" Three primary musical themes were played throughout Todd's evolution. The original Todd theme, from 1993 to 1996, encompassed Todd's rape of Marty and his early misdeeds. The second theme was heard throughout 1998 and 2000, and the third theme was first heard in 2001. The Todd and Marty rape scene was aided primarily by rock songs. Heard at a low volume in the background, hard rock songs assist moments building up to the rape; they intensify the otherwise implicitly tense, aggressive atmosphere, and set a chilling tone for viewers. When Todd is certain that he will rape Marty, right before going upstairs to Kevin's room where she rests, the volume of a song in the background (\\"Head Like a Hole\\") is increased, which emphasizes the lyrics: \\"I'd rather die/Than give you control.\\" This use of background music allowed Todd's motivation for the rape to significantly register with viewers. The menacing chords which played as Todd stalked and terrorized Nora in 1993 for mishandling his trial and sending him to prison were Todd's theme. There have been additional musical themes for Todd; for example, during his romance with Rebecca in 1994, an all- encompassing romantic theme with tragic nuances, which was at times intermixed with his ominous music, were heard. His rescue of Marty and two children from a car crash, and the Todd and T√©a romance, also have their own musical themes. For the mid-1994 plot point where Todd rescues Marty and the children, the music was changed to reflect his decision to be a better person. It becomes his dominant theme, and is assisted by a tuneful, forward-moving melody. This music is primarily a part of Todd's 1994 redemption storyline and the storyline when he is the Lord heir in 1995. According to Nichtern, the music for Todd and Te√°, which he composed with his friend keyboardist Kevin Bents, was \\"as close as we get to Todd 'romantic' music\\", with \\"the possibility of a little sensuality and romance\\". For the \\"Todd returns from the dead\\" 1996 storyline, demented-sounding, on-edge music signifies that Todd's psyche has worsened. This theme accompanied Todd's emotional breakdown and revenge scheme after discovering his wife, Blair, having sex with Patrick. Personality At the time of Todd's introduction to OLTL, he was a competitive athlete. His fraternity was the most important part of his life; Howarth stated that Todd was \\"under intense pressure from the male figures in his life\\". He felt that the key to understanding Todd was his concern about his status and how others perceived him. He thought that Todd mistreated people because it made him feel better about himself and that he did not want to appear vulnerable, so his defense mechanisms \\"spun out of control\\". Howarth, during an April 1994 Soap Opera Update interview, said that the only thing that he admired about Todd was his clothing style. His interviewer called Todd's early fashion sense \\"grunge, Salvation Army like 'rags',\\" and Howarth described Todd's later wardrobe as \\"all Ralph Lauren\\" and \\"[d]ouble R.L. 80 dollar pants and a 400-and-something-dollar jacket\\". St. John, as Todd's second portrayer, described the character as \\"kind of both good and bad. He's got his good side with his kids, and yet he is conniving and vicious and all those negative things\\". The show's writers presented Todd's personality as a combination of dark humor, uncouth behavior, and the essence of a tortured soul; he often delivers one-liners that range from humorous to sadistic. Soap opera columnist Jenn Bishop stated that Todd's personality is \\"violent, gentle, caring, apathetic, smart, obsessive, crazy, irrational, devilish, heroic, angst- filled, comical, etc.\\" and that \\"[he] loves, but he feels he's unworthy of true love because of the things he's done. He doesn't love himself and projects a facade of a confident, arrogant playboy, but underneath it all, he's someone who seeks an unattainable love\\". Columnist Jill Berry, who saw Todd as self-centered in the extreme, said that although Todd desperately wants to be loved, he is unable to give or receive it, and when he is loved, he will destroy it. She did acknowledge Todd's capability of loving his children, which he expressed by doing \\"crazy and illegal things to prove it\\", but felt that much of the difficulty he experiences is brought on by himself and that he is incapable of learning from his mistakes even when they hurt the people he loves. She said Todd is in need of \\"intensive therapy\\", which will never work because he refuses to change. For example, as portrayed by St. John in 2006, he fights for the custody of his son, Sam, but he is motivated by anger that he has been lied to and revenge more than by a desire to recover his child. For several years on the series, a defining characteristic of Todd's personality was his resistance to close relationships and sexual intimacy, which were due to his mistreatment by others, especially his adoptive father, who may have raped him when he was fourteen.Dutta, p. 36Waggett disagrees with Dutta that Todd was raped by Peter Manning (Waggett, p. 47). It was also due to his horrific past misdeeds, including his rape of Marty and dysfunctional aspects of his relationship with Blair. Surviving a near-death experience and being presumed dead in 1995 and, upon his return in 1996, finding Blair having sex with Patrick made Todd bitter; seeing Blair with another man sexually, soon after his presumed death, caused him to shut down emotionally. The writers made Todd's fear of intimacy into a prominent obstacle for his relationship with his second wife, T√©a. When she at one point attempts to seduce Todd by stripping down naked in front of him and pleading with him to make love to her, he rejects her, explaining that he no longer trusts himself to be intimate in that way; he subsequently throws her out, practically naked, into the middle of a snowstorm. Bishop stated, \\"Though viewers were given an explanation for his repulsive actions (lots and lots of childhood trauma), his crime was never excused or glossed over. Todd began to care for people ‚Äì Rebecca, then Blair and later T√©a ‚Äì something missing in his earlier sociopathic characteristics.\\" Soap opera commentator Kaydee Barnett stated that Todd's dark edges had been softened over a period of many years by Blair, Viki, and Starr. Todd's deep love for his sister, Viki, was partly demonstrated by him supporting her during her battle with cancer, her difficulties with her daughter and his niece, Jessica, and by defending Viki to her enemies. Berry enjoyed the vulnerability Viki brought out of Todd, and felt that his self-hatred demonstrated itself in many ways, including when he refused to name his son, Jack, after himself because his name carried too much baggage. In the 1998 storyline where he fakes dissociative identity disorder (split personalities) to avoid a prison sentence for hostage and threat charges, he is given four personalities that represent his core being: A childlike personality named Tom, Italian playboy Rod, parental figure Miss Perkins, and the abusive Pete (the personality responsible for his worst misdeeds). The revelation that he is faking the personalities devastates Viki, who had actually suffered from the disorder; it also brings out remorse in Todd, and causes him to reflect on his mistakes. The storyline ends with the implication that the personalities may not have been as fabricated as Todd believed them to be. The writers also made it so that his difficulties are manifested in his nightmares, which give him insomnia and are designed as a look into his psyche; at multiple points within the series, T√©a attempts to help Todd by encouraging him to open up to her about them, which he eventually does. His opinions on his enemies are conveyed clearly; he remains one step ahead of them, and consistently out-smarts police, family, and others he targets, sometimes using weapons. Casting and portrayals General Following Howarth's 1992 casting as Todd Manning, he occasionally vacated the role. His 2003 departure was his longest absence from OLTL; he did not return to the series until 2011. Todd was recast in 2003 with St. John, and Howarth joined As the World Turns as Paul Ryan until it was cancelled in 2010. Malone stated that because of Todd's appeal, which he credited to Howarth, \\"The network was therefore happy to have him return to Llanview whenever Roger would come back, and happy to have him move into story in major ways.\\" In April 2011, after several months of speculation, OLTL confirmed Howarth's return, although it was unclear if he would portray Todd Manning. He stated, \\"I am looking forward to returning to One Life to Live\\". Executive producer Frank Valentini said, \\"We are thrilled to have Roger return to One Life to Live\\". It was eventually revealed that St. John's version of the character was really Victor Lord, Jr., Todd's twin brother, conditioned to believe that he was Todd and assume Todd's identity, while the real Todd (Howarth) was held hostage for eight years. OLTL was cancelled in early 2012; Howarth brought Todd to General Hospital (GH), along with his co-stars Kristen Alderson as Starr and Michael Easton as John McBain. All three actors were forced to briefly leave GH when Prospect Park, the company that bought the rights to OLTL and aired an online version of the show in 2013, sued ABC for breach of contract. Prospect Park argued that ABC sabotaged its efforts by killing off two characters, Starr's boyfriend Cole and her young daughter Hope. Both St. John and Howarth appeared on the online version as Victor and Todd, but the suit prevented ABC from continuing to feature Howarth, Alderson, and Easton as their original characters on GH; ABC's solution was to create new characters for the actors. The online version of OLTL was cancelled after one season. Howarth Malone credited Howarth's versatility with the reason he was cast as Todd. During a February 1993 interview with Soap Opera Digest (SOD), Howarth stated he was surprised he won the part. \\"I really don't know how I made it,\\" he said. He met a One Life to Live casting director two years previously, while performing in a New York play, but, when the role of Todd opened up, he \\"auditioned just like everybody else\\". He \\"made it to callbacks, and [he] got the part\\". Howarth said, \\"I was hired ... to plant drugs in Jason Webb's jacket. All I knew was that my first name was Todd. I don't know what happened next. They called me in again and suddenly I had a last name 'Manning.' Then I get called to read another day.\\" Howarth stated, \\"I was happy to get the part of Todd, but it was the furthest thing from the fabric of my personality.\\" In an interview later that year, with Soap Opera Weekly, he grimaced when reminded of what he had said, and commented, \\"What a totally self-involved, pretentious thing to say.\\" He clarified his previous statement, saying that although he seemed to be consistently cast as a \\"bad guy\\" and as a \\"Greek frat brother-type\\", both his upbringing and experiences in college were different than those of Todd and his other roles. For example, Howarth was not in a fraternity in college, and, unlike Todd and his previous soap opera roles, Kent in Loving and Jory on Guiding Light, status was unimportant to him. Although Howarth was familiar with campus fraternity life while attending George Washington University, he did not base Todd or his other roles on anyone he knew. When asked about his roles, he was unable to explain why he was consistently cast as a bad guy, but said that he enjoyed it. \\"I would never want to come in now and play a nice guy for three months. That would be dreadfully boring. This suits me fine. It's just as easy to pretend I'm a bad guy as it is to pretend I'm a good guy,\\" Howarth said. Playing a rapist was like playing any other role because \\"[he knows] it's all make-believe\\". He was perplexed by writers' need to redeem villains. \\"Todd's a pretty interesting character just the way he is,\\" Howarth said in late 1994. \\"There's no need to fix it if it's not broken. I don't know where the whole notion of redeeming characters comes from. People used to say to me, 'I hope you get redeemed so you can stay on the show.' Well, Todd hasn't been redeemed, and he's still on the show.\\" He added, \\"I don't love the character I play. If I met Todd on the street, I wouldn't say 'Hi' to him, but I do love playing this character.\\" Howarth said of starring on a soap opera, \\"Every actor at one time passes through daytime. I wouldn't have said yes to the offer if I didn't want to stay a while on daytime.\\" He added, \\"I don't crave fame. It's kind of goofy. I didn't want to be a public figure. I wanted to be an actor, not a movie star. But I love rock 'n' roll-there, I'd rather be a rock star. That would be cool.\\" He said that \\"like all soap actors,\\" he sticks with the script the majority of the time, \\"but every now and then he goes off the page,\\" commenting, \\"You get to direct yourself. You come up with a little bit. It's improvisational. Maybe you're doing it just for your castmates, but the audience catches on.\\" In 1997 and 1998, Todd was given comedic partners similar to the set-up in comedy teams, in which the \\"funny guy\\" usually has a \\"straight man\\" who either sets up the joke or simply does not understand it. Todd's first partner was Charlie Briggs, portrayed by actor Robert J. Hogan. Hogan was first seen as Briggs in 1995, working for the rival publication The Banner before Todd \\"[steals] him away\\" to work at his newspaper. Hogan said, \\"Briggs had been on the show for 17 years, but they never showed him.\\" Scenes between Todd and Briggs typically involved Todd issuing \\"some bizarre order\\" to Briggs, or Todd asking Briggs a \\"way-out question\\" that was often \\"way out of line\\". During these scenes, Briggs would often respond with a stupefied look on his face. Though Briggs appeared lost at some of Todd's comments, Todd was sometimes unable to realize that the joke was about him. Hogan felt Briggs was \\"more than a match\\" for Todd. \\"You look at a kid yelling at you,\\" he said, \\"and you can't take him seriously.\\" Howarth on set with Todd's pet parrot Moose; the bird was portrayed by two South American blue and gold macaws. Another of Todd's comedic pairings is his friendship with a parrot he names Moose. Todd is closer to Moose than he is to most humans. He tells the bird his private thoughts and secrets, which causes conflict and antagonism between Moose and his wife at the time, T√©a. Florencia Lozano, T√©a's portrayer, stated, \\"My character ... has a very adversarial relationship with the bird ... It's sort of jealous of me, I'm jealous of the bird. We're both trying to get close to Todd.\\" The bird was portrayed by two South American blue and gold macaws named Flash and Lucky, and an Animal Planet documentary stated that they had developed an \\"impressive r√©sum√©\\" by the time they appeared on OLTL. They were trained by Ed Richman, who had worked with the birds for fifteen years in TV shows such as Magnum, P.I. and Jake and the Fatman. Richman stated that Howarth caught on \\"real quick\\" regarding his interaction with Flash and Lucky and said that he was the best actor he had worked with in the industry. The parrots were used for different purposes: for intimidating scenes where it looked like Moose \\"was going to kill somebody\\", Richman used Flash, and Lucky was used for the \\"loving, very caring, physically close\\" portrayal of Moose. Like other actors, the parrots were able to connect, in character, with their fellow castmembers and achieve comedic timing with them. Voice actor Ron Gallop was hired to deliver Moose's lines, which were crafted to help demonstrate Todd's train of thought, signified Todd and Moose's close bond, and consisted of funny or insulting remarks aimed at anyone causing problems for Todd. St. John Howarth's departure from the series motivated OLTL writers and producers to do what many considered impossible: recast Todd.Waggett, p. 35 During Michael Malone's second stint as head writer of OLTL, he had to decide if Todd would remain. Malone said that he and the other creators could not allow Todd to permanently leave the show's canvas, so they chose to recast the role. They offered the role to Easton, who had portrayed the vampire Caleb Morley on the soap opera Port Charles, but he turned it down because he did not want to be affiliated with a role played by another established actor.Waggett, p. 54 Malone said that St. John's audition was \\"extraordinary\\", and that although a committee was involved in the recast, everyone agreed \\"he was Todd\\". Malone felt that they made a risky decision, but St. John made it work and that he had made the character his own. Initially, St. John, in his first role in daytime television, was introduced as Walker Laurence, younger brother of Mitch Laurence.Waggett, p. 36 Author Gerry Waggett stated that Walker was \\"reinvented as Todd with plastic surgery\\" after the show's viewers accepted St. John as a part of the cast. The soap opera press and fans speculated for several months that Todd had been recast with St. John. Website Soap Central.com stated that despite executive producer Frank Valentini neither confirming nor denying it, St. John's character exhibited \\"Todd-like\\" behavior. TV Guide confirmed the speculation and reported that St. John, when asked about it, stated, \\"That would be fascinating, though I don't see how it would work,\\" and added, \\"Todd [had] a different voice and height, but this is a soap world and anything can happen.\\" St. John's version of Todd had undergone plastic surgery after being severely beaten during a murder attempt on his life ordered by Mitch Laurence. While recovering in the hospital, Todd conducts research and learns Mitch has a brother named Walker (also portrayed by St. John), who goes by the name Flynn Laurence. Todd pays Flynn for information on Mitch, and has extensive plastic surgery in order to physically resemble Flynn and get revenge on (as well as protect his family from) Mitch. The writers revealed Walker's true identify slowly, allowing Walker to develop as a new character before hinting that he could be Todd. St. John was unaware that Malone and the producers of OLTL were considering him as Todd, but had no strategy in his performance once he won the role. When speaking of the recast, he stated, \\"It's nice, because I had instant concrete relationships.\\" He liked that he could consult old scripts and his fellow castmembers to gain information about his character, resources he did not have when playing Walker. He was able to use these resources to figure out his relationship to other characters, which helped him analyze how to play a scene. St. John stated that as an actor, he let the audience interpret the character, and believed in exploring and portraying the moment as it was written in the script. He said, \\"Todd is already written on the page, so it's my job to bring him to life in that moment.\\" St. John was instructed by the show's directors to watch about fifteen episodes of Howarth's performances of Todd because they wanted him to portray Todd like Howarth did. St. John reported that he watched two episodes, but never tried to mimic Howarth's style because he felt that it was limiting, uncreative, and destructive. He said, \\"I needed to get a sense of who Todd was first, and that has to happen organically.\\" He did not care if Marlon Brando portrayed the role before him, and said that even actors who portray Hamlet do it differently, adding, \\"I don't care what the other guy did. That's his time.\\" St. John felt that it was up to him to decide how to perform Todd. \\"I know that sounds very arrogant and overconfident,\\" he stated, \\"but it would be no fun to try to mimic somebody.\\" Unlike how most actors are trained, St. John believed that it was not up to the performer to interpret the character, but that a character existed regardless of how an actor played him, which he realized was \\"an unusual way to approach acting\\". He also thought that playing Todd was fun and \\"never boring to watch\\" because Todd, although popular with the audience, is an unlikable character. St. John told Branco that when people asked him if Todd was capable of harming his loved ones, like his long-time love Blair or daughter Starr, St. John would say that Todd was capable of anything, even being sexually attracted to Starr or one of her friends, because to state otherwise meant that he was \\"limiting the character\\". He added, \\"Todd is a marvelous character to play because he could commit genocide, or find a cure for AIDS. He's full of possibilities‚Äîgood and bad ... See, as an actor that always gives you conflict to play‚Äîand that subtext enriches a performance.\\" Early writing and literary analysis Archetypes and rape Howarth said writers go with a recognizable archetype when creating soap opera characters. Writer Jennifer Hayward felt the same, stating that like 19th century melodrama and serials, soap operas draw on powerful archetypes.Hayward, p. 175 Writer Dianne L. Brooks states that the storyline conforms to many of the same conventions of how rape has been presented in soap operas.Brooks, p. 115 According to Hayward, the OLTL writers \\"had a terrific time camping up Todd as the embodiment of evil\\".Hayward, p. 175 She said that the writers who created Todd's first major storyline, the gang rape of Marty Saybrooke and its aftermath, treated rape like most soap operas had done in the past, by using archetypes such as the fight between good and evil and the contrast between the weak and strong. Author Gerry Waggett said, \\"The close-ups of the rapists' faces during the assault, distorted to capture Marty's scared and drunken perspective, rank among the show's most graphic images.\\" An attempt was made to dramatize the rape and present it differently than the typical voyeuristic perspective, and the scenes were designed to disturb the audience.Brooks, p. 116 Waggett added: \\"Marty's subsequent quest to bring her rapists to justice dominated the show\\" throughout the summer of 1993.Waggett, p. 27 Up to this point, soap operas used rape and its related archetypes to, like their nineteenth-century melodrama counterparts, \\"critique power relationships, especially the oppression of the poor by the rich and of women by men\\". Hayward believes that the storyline was initially flawed because two of the rapists, Todd and Zach, were demonized, which oversimplified rape and \\"failed to capture the complex power relations underlying ... violence towards women\\". The perpetrators were \\"simply evil or out control\\", so they and their mindsets they represented could be rejected.Hayward, p. 174 The three characters represented three archetypes of the rapist: \\"the evil instigator\\" (Todd); \\"the good resister\\" (Powell), and \\"the mediator between these polarized figures\\" (Zach), but also represented a departure from how rape was treated in soap operas. Brooks called the rapists \\"a complicated alternative to the standard soap opera rapist\\", because they had a different relationship with their victim than in previous rape narratives and because they were multiple. Todd, whom Brooks called the \\"evil 'other, was the leader and most villainous of the group and had a previous physical relationship with Marty. Hayward said, \\"What becomes especially clear is that for these characters the act of rape is not about sex, about women, or even about Marty. It is about what takes place ... between men.\\" Like serials throughout history, soap operas use the unstable identity as a literary device, which is evidenced by the genre's use of mistaken identities, evil twins, and characters that suffer from multiple personality disorder and whom come back from the dead. Identity is used in the rape storyline as well. Before the rape, Todd was crude yet still human, but afterwards, he became a dehumanized embodiment of rage, demonstrated by Todd's bizarre and dangerous behavior after his conviction. Powell Lord, whose name is full of the same kind of symbolism Dickens used when choosing his characters' names and who initially urges his friends to let Marty go yet ultimately gives into peer pressure, is a \\"relative 'good character as compared to Todd's absolute evil' identity\\".Hayward, pp. 174‚Äì175 In Hayward's opinion, \\"The show also departs from the rape paradigm not only by insisting on the essential 'goodness' of Powell Lord ... but even more startlingly by redeeming the evil Todd\\". Initially, \\"the increasingly guilt-ridden\\" Powell is the only rapist who has a conscience. He attempts to convince Todd and Zach to confess their crime, and comes close to confessing to his lawyer.Hayward, p. 158 Hayward calls Powell, like Todd, \\"redeemed\\",Hayward, p. 170 but unlike Todd, was so guilt-ridden that he attempted suicide, was forgiven by Marty, and received a much lighter jail sentence than Zach or Todd.Hayward, pp. 175‚Äì176 Redeeming Todd Initially, Todd, as described by Hayward, was written as \\"unequivocally bad: sullen, remorseless, charmless\\". As Todd's popularity grew with the audience, mostly due to Howarth's abilities to portray Todd as more than a one- dimensional rapist, Malone and executive producer Susan Bedsow Horgan chose the controversial option of redeeming Todd rather than killing him off or permanently sending him to prison, which is what soap operas had usually done with irredeemable rapists in the past. The writers began to redeem Todd, or change him so that he could be incorporated into the show, in the spring of 1994, a year after the rape. Hayward states that it required \\"a whole arsenal of symbolic weaponry,\\" something that had never happened in soap operas before. Malone was intrigued by crafting the story in this way, and saw it as the spiritual journey of a man who wanted forgiveness for his past misdeeds. Malone stated that Todd believes that he does not deserve forgiveness, which contributes to him embracing his worst qualities, something Malone felt worked better due to Howarth's acting choices, which prevented Todd from acquiring redemption easily. Malone felt the most important part of Todd's redemption was to have him re-confront Marty in order to better deal with the fact he initiated her rape. As well as having Todd risk his freedom from prison and save Marty from a car crash, Todd donates his own blood to Marty to ensure she survives. A year later, he risks his life to save Patrick, Marty's lover, from death; this act leads to Todd's presumed death. Despite having the character yearn to be thought of as a decent human being, the writers felt his good deeds should never make him feel any less horrible for having raped Marty. Initially, Howarth disagreed, and did not consider the storylines to be redemptive. \\"[Todd's] not being redeemed at all,\\" he said. \\"Todd, as I see it, is looking for a way to overcome this rage so he can live in society again. From now on, his menace will be on the surface, not exploding. It's more interesting if his violence is on the surface and that he play against it. That's where the subtlety is.\\" Hayward stated that the writers turned Todd from a realistic soap opera character into \\"the villain appropriated from nineteenth-century melodrama\\" and Gothic fiction traditions.Hayward, p. 177 After Todd is sent to prison for Marty's rape, he vows he will escape, and does so by drugging himself and forcing himself to wake up from a coma, which allows him to escape from a speeding ambulance. He returns to Llanview to stalk and terrorize Nora, the lawyer who threw his court case, who had gone temporarily blind. He tries to rape Marty for the third time, later inadvertently kills Marty's boyfriend Suede during a scuffle, kidnaps the evangelist Rebecca Lewis, and is shot by the police, but survives. The writers also began to deepen his character by emphasizing his tenderness towards Rebecca and showing flashbacks of the abuse he experienced from his adoptive father, which Hayward states does not \\"historicize the problem but simply removes the cause of violence one step\\". Laurie Stone of the Village Voice commented that Howarth's performance steered Todd away from cartoon villainy, \\"heightening the character's wildness as a dodge from sentimentality and high- mindedness\\". Instead of killing Todd off as other soap operas had done to other unrepentant rapists, OLTL chose, as Stone put it, \\"to renovate the genre: maintaining Todd as a rapist, while enlarging his human dimension\\". Stone addressed how the writers kept Todd on the OLTL canvas, stating, \\"Characters as dangerous as Todd go up in flames on soaps. You can see little coffins on their eyelids, leaving only one question: how will the fiend get whacked?\\" Stone said that \\"Todd was this close to being offed, but Howarth made that choice laughable. Rampaging through fictional Llanview, he injected ambiguity into the bluntest dialogue, his sneers averting cynicism to reveal depression and humor\\" and \\"transformed Todd into a soul-wrenched Lucifer, his rage ripped from abuse and bathed in vengeful glee, his sexiness rising off his instinct for survival and his outlaw impulse to disrupt.\\" She added, \\"Even the ragged scar he acquired on one cheek only heightened his animal appeal. No soap would jettison such gold and electricity‚Äîa figure simultaneously furious, ironic, melancholy, and horny.\\" The writers used strong imagery to redeem Todd. Malone, who had been a novelist and was known for his \\"Dickensian\\" plots on OLTL, was influenced by nineteenth-century literature.Hayward, p. 178 Malone told Stone that he compared Rebecca's decision to marry Powell instead of Todd to Cathy's decision to marry Edgar Linton instead of Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights. According to Stone, Todd is a classical character‚àí\\"a soap character of unprecedented psychological complexity, a being whose feelings are intrinsically mixed and mostly unresolvable\\". Hayward stated that Malone and his team of writers used four techniques drawn from the conventions of Victorian sentimental fiction to redeem Todd: his unhappy childhood with an aloof but caring mother and abusive father; sending Todd to church to confess his past sins and present impulses; his love for Rebecca, \\"an innocent and highly religious virgin\\"; and his friendship with two children, C.J. and Sarah Roberts.Hayward, pp. 178‚Äì179 Hayward calls Rebecca, with her \\"open-mouthed passivity\\" and \\"pre-Raphaelite curls\\", \\"almost a caricature of Dicken's more sentimental and less felicitous heroines\\".Hayward, p. 179 She believes that many of Todd's scenes with Rebecca are heavily iconic, with symbolic representations of the Virgin Mary and Freudian images of Todd's own feminization. The show's writers used aspects of Frankenstein to add more depth to Todd, and to make him more sympathetic to the audience. Hayward compares Todd to Mary Shelley's monster (Frankenstein's monster), especially his friendship with C.J. and Sarah. Shelley's monster watches two children playing, and saves a young girl from drowning. Similarly, Todd rescues C.J. and Sarah's cousin, Jessica, from being manhandled by an older boy; this leads to him meeting C.J. and Sarah. Like Shelley's monster, Todd observes the family's happy moments from afar, and wishes to be part of their lives. He uses his time alone to make toys for the children. Once they accidentally discover him, he manipulates them into keeping his whereabouts a secret by telling them he is \\"a genie on the run from an evil master\\". Hayward said, \\"The stories he tells them function as clear metaphors for his feelings about his father.\\" Stone added that Todd's counseling sessions in prison were the writers' attempts to redeem Todd, and both she and Hayward include one of the final techniques the writers used: Todd's rescue of Marty, Jessica and C.J. soon after a car crash.Hayward, p. 181 Hayward calls the writers' attempts to use powerful narrative and visual techniques to redeem Todd \\"dubious at best\\".Hayward, p. 182 Writer Mary D. Dutta believed that OLTL, in order to \\"assuage the moral qualms associated with a sympathetic rapist\\", added \\"mitigating reasons for Todd's sexual abuse of Marty\\"; namely, that he was raped at the age of fourteen by his adoptive father, Peter Manning, though whether or not he was raped is disputed. Dutta feels that the gang rape storyline invokes many of the rape myths that have appeared in literature since the 18th century, which includes \\"only bad girls get raped,\\" \\"women ask for it,\\" and \\"women 'cry rape' only when they've been jilted or have something to cover up\\". Dutta also includes the myth of the \\"reformed rake\\", or \\"the rapist redeemed by the woman who loves him, not uncommonly the same woman he raped\\", which \\"deny or reduce perceived injury, or ... blame the victims for their own victimization\\".Dutta, p. 35 Dutta states, \\"Todd's redemption begins with his rescue of Marty and two children from a car wreck and ends with the discovery that he is the rightful heir to a huge fortune.\\" Reception and impact General popularity Todd's impact is varied. The rape storyline inspired feminist studies, and, in 1994, OLTL was awarded several Daytime Emmys in writing and acting for all the principles involved.Brooks, p. 114 Michael Malone and Josh Griffith's team won an Emmy for writing, Susan Haskell won an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, and Hillary B. Smith was awarded the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. Howarth won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series.Waggett, p. 219 In 1995, Howarth was nominated for an Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series and Soap Opera Digest (SOD) named him Outstanding Leading Actor. SOD also named him Outstanding Villain in 1998. While Howarth has been called a \\"fan favorite, and one of the best actors in soaps\\", Todd has been called \\"one of the greatest characters of all- time\\" and Howarth's portrayal of him has been called \\"iconic\\". The Hollywood Reporter stated that even though Todd was a convicted rapist, he was the most popular character and Howarth was the most popular actor on OLTL. According to Waggett, the rape storyline propelled Todd \\"onto the list of OLTL most despicable villains\\".Waggett, p. xvii He said that due to the storyline and to Howarth's talent, Todd \\"became the show's next centerpiece villain and eventually the show's male lead\\".Waggett, p. 26 Howarth appeared on several interview shows following his Emmy win in 1994, including the Phil Donahue Show in May, with six other male soap stars, and later that month, on Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee. Host Regis Philbin commented on the fact that Howarth was receiving more fan mail than any other American soap opera star,Waggett confirmed that Howarth had received more fan mail than his castmembers, stating, \\"During the height of the Todd Manning phenomenon, one of the secretaries at ABC would sort the mail into two large bags: one for Roger Howarth and one for the rest of the cast.\\" (Waggett, p. 187). and called him \\"a terrible villain, who's become a heartthrob to thousands of wildly adoring fans\\". TV Guide referred to Todd as a breakout character. Susan Haskell (Marty) and Hillary B. Smith (Nora), who, along with Howarth, won acting Emmys in 1994 for their roles in the gang rape storyline. At the height of Todd's popularity, which was called \\"Todd-mania\\" and \\"the Todd Manning phenomenon\\", Howarth was disturbed that so many women were attracted to Todd and that the show's writers had begun to redeem the character. In a September 1995 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the publication stated that Howarth was troubled that \\"his villainous character became such a fan favorite\\". In October 1995, Howarth told SOD, \\"People have come up to me and said, 'My 7-year-old loves you.' What do I say to that? I'm not going to tell them, 'Don't let your 7-year-old watch TV.' But I have to say, it's disturbing.\\" He gave credit to the show's writers for Todd's popularity, saying that the rapists' trial was well constructed and added, \\"I think, right now, we're just riding the wave of something that started last summer. Beyond that, I don't really know why people like Todd\\". Todd's rampant popularity intruded on Howarth's life. \\"It's really starting to frustrate me because I can't just go to work anymore,\\" he said. He stopped doing a lot of press interviews after female fans screamed \\"Rape me, Todd\\" at fan events, and because of his disagreement with Todd's redemption arc. His comings-and-goings from time to time throughout the years, even though the role of Todd had been re-cast with St. John, were greeted with anticipation, excitement, and speculation from the fans. At one point in 2000, Howarth returned for a week, accompanied by significant fanfare, in order to assist with the departure of Florencia Lozano (Te√°). During the ten years he was on the show, rumors of his departures were reported sometimes weekly by the soap opera press. Soap Opera Magazine attributed the success of Todd to Howarth's face and skill as an actor. In February 1998, the magazine stated, \\"Although the scar that traverses his face while he plays Llanview's dark prince isn't real, the menacing intensity Roger Howarth can so effortlessly convey with his eyes and furrowed brow are frighteningly authentic.\\" Soap Opera Weekly called his presence \\"hypnotic\\" and stated that his eyes relayed his focus. The magazine added that Howarth \\"has given Todd such a deliciously frightening edge we hope he wreaks more havoc in Llanview\\". Marla Hart of the Chicago Tribune stated that \\"it has been an unexpected pleasure to watch actor Roger Howarth as a lost soul in search of spiritual redemption\\". Hart speculated that the darkness Howarth brought to the role made him interesting to watch and was responsible for his Emmy win in 1994. St. John and the writers received praise for the recast, and for successfully re-integrating Todd into the show's canvas. Soap Opera Weekly stated, \\"They said it couldn't be done. One Life to Live's Todd (previously played by Roger Howarth) could not be recast. But with an appealing actor and the right pacing, One Life to Live may just have done it\\". The magazine stated that the writers revealed Todd's identity slowly, letting Walker develop as a character before dropping hints that he might be Todd. By the time he disclosed who he really was to his daughter Starr, the audience had already suspected the truth. Soap Opera Weekly called the reveal scene between St. John and Alderson, who played Starr, \\"one of those great (and, these days, rare) must-see moments\\". Soap Opera Digest said that despite the recast, a difficult situation in and of itself, \\"St. John aptly distinguished between Walker, who's really Todd, as well as Flynn, who pretended to be Walker\\". The magazine stated that St. John revealed glimmers of Todd to the audience: \\"We could see Todd when Walker lowered his eyes while holding back from telling his sister, Viki; with fiancee Blair, Walker's gaze was always shifting, making sure nothing could clue her in to his secret\\". The article also credited St. John with maintaining \\"the [uniquely scheming] relationship of Todd and Starr\\" and for keeping their scenes touching and delightful. On May 29, 2006, in what the soap opera section of SheKnows described as \\"one of the most memorable moments\\" for OLTL, and \\"breathtaking, nerve-racking, heart wrenching\\", St. John portrayed Todd being executed for a crime he did not commit. At the last moment, after the lethal injection has been administered, John McBain rushes in declaring Todd's innocence, with proof: the woman Todd is accused of killing (Margaret Cochran) is at his side, clearly still alive. Todd is revived soon afterward. During the execution episode, a montage a little over four minutes in length was shown while a song played in the background. The song was called \\"Forsaken\\" (or \\"Todd's Song\\") and written by Michal Towber especially for the show. The montage included reaction shots of those witnessing the execution, shots of Starr crying in the presence of a lynch mob outside the prison, and flashbacks of Todd's children and of Blair during both St. John and Howarth's tenures as Todd, with Howarth's face unseen. The scenes were called \\"unbearable\\" by viewers, and their responses were varied. Much of the audience was infuriated by Blair's unwillingness to believe that Todd was innocent. Many viewers thought that Todd's death was permanent; Soap Opera Digest speculated that this was due to limited Internet access or to a lack of interest in spoilers. Although fans and St. John's co-workers felt that he deserved an Emmy nomination for his death row performances, he did not receive one, but OLTL received a nomination for Outstanding Drama Series by submitting the episode. One soap opera website criticized St. John's Emmy snub, stating that it was incongruous that the show's Best Show nomination was due in large part to St. John's performance. Soap opera commentators Nelson Branco and Michael Fairman called St. John's execution performances the best on any daytime drama in the early 2000s. Towber and other composers for the show were nominated for Outstanding Achievement in Music Direction and Composition for a Drama Series. Controversy and fan debate =Rape and redemption= Although the gang rape storyline was well-received, it was also criticized. Jennifer Hayward, in her literary analysis of the rape and its similarity to nineteenth century melodrama, stated that this storyline not only polarized \\"the gap between rapists and the raped but also the figure of the rapist himself\\", and that insisting on \\"the 'essential' goodness\\" of Powell Lord implied that peer pressure \\"could be an adequate (or even physiologically possible) excuse for rape\\". Scholar Mary Buhl Dutta, arguing that the storyline perpetuated rape myths, commented on how the series especially used Marty, who fulfilled the stereotype of \\"the bad girl\\" who was the rape victim. Dutta stated that \\"Marty had once 'cried rape when the Rev. Andrew Carpenter \\"rebuffed her romantic overtures, falsely accusing him of sexually abusing a boy he was counseling\\". After she was actually raped, she falsely yet unintentionally accuses Kevin Buchanan, who was innocent. Marty, according to Dutta, \\"is a 'bad girl' because she had a one-night stand with Todd before the rape, bolstering his later claim she 'asked for it' in their second sexual encounter\\". Critics have wondered why Todd is popular. Soap opera journalist Marlena De Lacroix, who acknowledged that she neither liked nor understood Todd, expressed her inability to understand his popularity among so many fans, even during his several hiatuses from the show. She asked, \\"Why has the show devoted years of storyline time to him and all but made a hero out of a criminal?\\" Hayward, who said that her own response to Todd's redemption was ambivalent, called the writers' attempt to redeem Todd controversial and stated that the role of Rebecca, the woman the writers paired Todd with during the redemption process, \\"seems to encourage both female and male fantasies about the power of a 'good woman' to save a man from his own violent impulses\\". In his book Behold the Man, Edisol Dotson suggested that viewers accepted Todd's redemption because he was physically attractive. Dotson stated, \\"Were Todd an ugly man, he would have never been forgiven, and female fans would not crowd the studio's backdoor shouting his name.\\" Soap opera commentator Jenn Bishop said she found it difficult to explain Todd's popularity, and that if she is perplexed about her feelings regarding him, it is understandable that others would be as well. \\"If I were to give a surface level assessment of Todd, I'd say he's an abhorrent character with little to no redeeming qualities,\\" she said. \\"His actions, which span from the immoral to criminal, can be downright heinous. I wouldn't want to know Todd, let alone be around him in real life. Nor would I want any woman to have any sort of relationship with him.\\" Instead of seeing Todd as an antihero, she saw him as more of \\"an anti-anti-hero\\" and stated that what added to his appeal was that his rape storyline was authentic. \\"While Todd is not the first (or the last) soap character to have committed this crime, the realness of this particular storyline didn't leave a lot of room for rewrites,\\" Bishop commented. \\"For example, Luke's rape of Laura on General Hospital was rewritten and for years was referred to as a 'seduction.' There was no 'grey area'. This [Todd's rape of Marty] could not be dismissed as simply the behavior of a romantic rogue.\\" To Bishop, the end result of this aspect, and that the writers had Todd generally pay for his crimes, \\"was the development of a dynamic, unpredictable, multi-faceted character with many traits that conflict with one another\\" and \\"[a]ll this makes for one messed up guy, intriguing to the viewers and one I can't help but like\\". Hayward categorized the writing team involved in Todd's redemption as \\"an usually high number of male writers\\", and as an unusual situation because, historically, most soap opera writers have been women. In a June 1994 interview with TV Guide, in an article about the trend during the early 1990s of redeemed rapists on soap operas, head writer Malone commented that \\"[t]he bond between the woman and the violator is a great historical tradition in fiction and films,\\" and said that Rudolph Valentino, Humphrey Bogart, Kirk Douglas, and Clark Gable \\"all began as totally irredeemable villains.\\" Although he did not think that most women want to be raped or are drawn to violence, he said that viewers \\"are responding to the intensity of passion and an actor who lets you inside the torment. Some [women] believe they can be swept up in that passion and still turn it good. They think, 'With me, he'd be different. The author of the article, Michael Logan, supported Malone's statements, and commented, \\"Let's call a spade a spade. There is a large contingent of American female soap viewers who find something very attractive about rapists\\". Hayward reported that many female viewers were furious that Logan had described them this way, and stated that their attraction to Todd was due to the skill of the actor portraying him. Kirk Douglas, who started out playing irredeemable villains like Todd Howarth said he had no desire to portray a redeemed Todd, and that the show would be better off finding \\"a Todd who won't object to the material.\\" He subsequently left the series for a year. In the October 24, 1995 Soap Opera Digest issue, he stated: > In the beginning, the character of Todd was successful. I'll always be proud > of this story, because it was the result of a real team effort. It was one > of those spectacular times when the writer, producer, director, grips, > engineers and actors were all on the same wavelength. Everybody was working > toward a common goal. My task, at the time, was to show the humanity of > someone who was basically inhuman. Todd wasn't one-dimensional, but he was > definitely a serious psychopath. Todd was a serial rapist. He raped Carol > Swift. Then, he raped Marty Saybrooke, and that rape was brutal, intense, > violent and realistic. There were innuendos he had raped other women before. > He stalked Nora, he stalked and tried to rape Luna. [Then-Executive > Producer] Linda Gottlieb told me with reasonable certainty that [One Life to > Live] would not try to redeem Todd. So, I didn't think the character would > change. Then about a year ago, it became clear to me they were taking the > character on a different path‚Äîthey were redeeming him. In my mind, I'd been > hired to play Todd Manning, a very realistic, serious psychopath. But now, > the powers-that-be wanted me to play Todd Lord. And the story of Todd Lord > is not realistic‚Äîit's a fairy tale. I thought, \\"It would be best for the > show if I were to leave.\\" That's when I tendered my resignation. Howarth also stated that Todd and Marty suddenly bonding, even if reluctantly, did not make sense and that he could not, in good conscience, support Todd's redemption by continuing to play him as Todd Lord, who had become a likable character. Since the rape was, as he called it, \\"so in-depth and so brutal\\", he viewed Todd and Marty doing something like having drinks with each other bizarre. Entertainment Weekly reported that One Life to Live agreed to let Howarth go on the condition he would not appear on another soap opera for twelve months. Indy Week said, \\"Todd was partially redeemed into a self- destructive antihero who remained popular until the show's end, but his portrayer and many critics were wary of having him becoming a romantic lead.\\" =Merchandising= In 2002, as part of ABC's push to sell merchandise from its soap operas, the network began selling a doll in Todd's likeness on its website, but were thwarted by a backlash. Modeled after cartoon versions of the Manning family that Starr would sometimes imagine, the doll sold for $19.95.Waggett stated, \\"One Life to Live became the first soap opera to incorporate animation into its story line. Producer Gary Tomlin put a spin on the daydream convention by presenting Starr Manning's (Kristen Alderson) varied fantasies as cartoons. (Waggett, p. 34). According to the description on the site, it was \\"an all-cloth doll with brown felt hair and blue eyes. He is 20 inches standing. He wears a blue shirt and black pants\\". The doll's face also included Todd's scar. Even though several years had passed since the gang rape and Todd had \\"since settled down\\", and had become a more sympathetic character, rape victim advocate groups thought that selling the doll glorified sexual assault; so ABC removed the doll from its online store. Pictures of the doll were pulled from the Internet and the doll was blocked from being available at eBay or any other online store. The controversy began when the industry newsletter \\"The Jack Myers Report\\" harshly criticized ABC for selling the doll, and other news outlets reported the snafu. Bob Tedeschi of The New York Times stated, \\"In the charge toward e-commerce revenues, ABC learned a useful lesson last week: Don't try to sell cuddly rag dolls depicting homicidal rapists\\". Angela Shapiro, president of ABC, said, \\"I was insensitive and take total responsibility for it. I should have been sensitive to the history of the character and I wasn't\\". Another ABC executive stated, \\"We didn't exercise proper sensitivity to the history of the character of Todd. We have re-evaluated and decided not to sell the doll\\". A doll of Todd's daughter, Starr, remained in ABC stores. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun- Times commented, \\"I suppose ABC didn't have much of a choice but to pull the product--but I have to wonder about the people who voiced those protests.\\" He added, \\"It was a stupid SOCK DOLL based on a SOAP OPERA CHARACTER. If you're offended by that, how do you get through the day without succumbing to fits of hysterical outrage every five minutes?\\" =Recasting= When Todd was recast with St. John after Howarth's departure, many fans felt that like the roles of Luke Spencer (Anthony Geary) on General Hospital and Erica Kane (Susan Lucci) on All My Children, Todd should be portrayed only by the actor who had originated the role.Waggett, pp. 35‚Äì36 As Soap Opera Digest put it, \\"Few recasts caused more uproar\\". Soap Opera Digest also stated that while there were fans who \\"will only consider Howarth to be their beloved Todd\\", St. John won over many fans by putting a lighter spin on the character. Soap Opera Weekly stated that they were \\"on board with St. John\\". Soap Opera Digest agreed, commenting that St. John made the transition believable while adding new facets to the character. The magazine also stated that Todd's new appearance aided in his continuing redemption. Soap opera columnist Jill Berry expressed her approval for the recast, stating, \\"Trevor's Todd continues to impress me. He has given some sweetness to Todd that I find totally appealing\\". In late 2006, St. John and Howarth simultaneously began contract negotiations with their respective shows, which caused rumors that St. John was departing from OLTL, leaving room for Howarth, who was with the soap opera As the World Turns at the time, to return as Todd. TV Guide sought to clear up the matter and questioned executive producer Frank Valentini, who stated that although he was not able to comment on contracts, the producers were \\"doing our best to make sure that we do right by the audience\\". In 2007, TV Guide received official confirmation Howarth would not be returning to the series. The magazine conducted a poll on its website, TV Guide.com, and found that 82 percent of the show's viewers wanted to see Howarth return. Daniel R. Coleridge of TV Guide.com disagreed with the results, stating, \\"Perhaps I'm in the minority, but I absolutely adore Trevor St. John\\", whose portrayal of Todd he found \\"very cocky, arrogant and humorous in a sexy way\\". In 2009, following the announcement that As the World Turns would be cancelled in 2010, rumors that Howarth would return to OLTL regained momentum. The rumors were further fueled by an August 2010 episode of OLTL, in which Howarth's picture was shown and a delirious T√©a stated that the current Todd (St. John) was not Todd Manning. This resulted in what Dan Kroll of the website Soap Opera Central.com described as fans \\"rac[ing] to their computers to figure out the meaning of the scene\\". Kroll speculated that the scene was \\"crafted merely to get fans talking, or was it a hint to viewers something big was coming down the pike?\\" Soap Opera Network, citing unnamed sources and pointing to the 2010 episode, reported on their website that they had \\"learned exclusively Howarth [would] indeed be returning\\" to the series in the near future. Soap Opera Digest columnist Carolyn Hinsey dismissed the report, stating on her Facebook page, \\"Seriously, stop with the Howarth misinformation here please. He is not coming back to OLTL. Case closed.\\" Some fans were convinced that St. John's character was an impostor, while others were not; although Howarth eventually returned as Todd in 2011, his return was initially accompanied with fan debate regarding what role he would play, Todd Manning or a new character. =Violence towards teenagers= According to Nelson Branco of TV Guide, OLTL aired \\"some of the most explosive and ugliest scenes ever broadcast on daytime\\" television in March 2008 when Todd beat up teenager Cole Thornhart (his daughter's boyfriend and Marty's son), and slapped Starr and Cole's friends Markko Rivera and Langston Wilde. Todd barges in on Starr and Cole in bed together for the first time, jumping to the conclusion that Cole had raped her, \\"and [beats] the son of his rape victim relentlessly\\". At least one soap opera blogger was outraged, and wanted Todd to be punished. In Branco's opinion, head writer Ron Carlivati wanted to use the storyline to return Todd to his dark roots by showing him as a monster again, stating, \\"Carlivati chose to do something unique, bold and risky with one of his marquee characters\\", demonstrating Todd's damaged personality and calling into question his mental stability. Carlivati said that Todd was convinced that Starr's alleged rape was karmic payback, even when Starr insisted that she had not been raped. Branco postulated that Todd's conclusion and strong reaction to seeing the two in bed together was Todd's inability to separate sex from violence, stating, \\"Todd, in that instance, became unhinged, paranoid, and out-of-control\\". Todd was in denial, and even almost hit Starr twice when she challenged his beliefs. The scenes were praised as \\"riveting\\". Soap columnist Marlena De Lacroix, a self-described \\"Todd hater\\" who felt that the character was psychotic, expressed hope that they were \\"the beginning of a storyline that will delve into Todd's mind and enlighten viewers as to the complexities of a character who is mentally ill\\". De Lacroix worried that although the storyline had the potential to be memorable, it could be another way to build sympathy for Todd. =Revictimizing Marty= Deciding to revisit the rape storyline in 2007, Carlivati wrote a story in which Marty is thrown from a van during a car crash later that year. The van explodes, and she is presumed dead. In June 2008, Todd discovers her alive, and finds that she is afflicted with amnesia and has been crippled since the crash. He starts to nurse her back to health, lying to her about her identity and her importance to the people she loves, and he starts to develop romantic feelings for her. ABC promoted the storyline by airing ads that called it, \\"The story you thought you'd never see\\". Carlivati defended the storyline by assuring the audience, who was concerned about and resisted the storyline, that it would not have been written if Marty had not lost her memories. He stated that he was aware of how serious it was pairing the characters romantically, but did not feel like they were damaging Marty's character. Carlivati was committed to having the storyline progress slowly, and to using the actors' and characters' chemistry. Eventually, Todd and Marty have sex; Todd insists that he has always been in love with Marty and plots to steal his daughter's baby (who is also Marty's grandchild), run off with Marty and the baby, and raise the baby with her. According to Branco, the show's past writing teams had proposed creating a Marty and Todd love story, but it never happened, mostly because Haskell and Howarth had refused to participate. In Branco's opinion, the push toward the storyline was the reason Howarth eventually left OLTL for As the World Turns. By contrast, at a fan gathering in 2008, St. John joked about Todd and Marty bonding during the Carlivati storyline, stating, \\"I'm all for gang rape.\\" He later issued an apology for the comment: \\"I should know better than to ever try and make a joke about such a serious subject. I intended no disre[s]pect and apologize to anyone I offended.\\" De Lacroix found Carlivati's storyline \\"disgusting\\", stating that it was exploitative, misogynistic, insulting to the audience, and \\"the most phony, stupidly contrived story I have ever seen\\". She also felt that it was a severe misjustice to the original storyline. Fans who were opposed to the storyline called it \\"the re-rape\\", and ABC aired public service announcements (PSAs) during the Todd and Marty sex scene for their viewers. Berry supported ABC's use of the PSAs, but felt that they were used to justify the storyline and stated that it would have been better to not have presented it in the first place. Lynn Parrish, a spokesperson for Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN), which was not consulted by the show's writers, spoke out against the \\"re-rape\\" storyline. She told Branco, \\"There is nothing romantic about rape\\", and that \\"whoever writes a romance between a rapist and its victim under any circumstances clearly doesn't understand rape nor violence‚Äîand probably shouldn't be writing about it\\". Branco called the original rape storyline \\"the gold standard of rape stories,\\" and stated that Carlivati had changed it into a soap opera clich√©. Carlivati's addition to the characters' histories left him feeling betrayed, hurt, depressed, angry, insulted, and disgusted, and he said that he had wasted almost 20 years investing in and believing in the original rape storyline. At the \\"re-rape\\" storyline's conclusion, Branco stated that the payoff was worth the tense moments. \\"However obscene or depraved the riskiest storyline in recent memory was,\\" he said, \\"the fallout has been shockingly riveting‚Äîthanks to the fact that head writer Ron Carlivati is playing all the psychological beats of Todd's self-serving and criminal actions.\\" Branco also gave credit to St. John. \\"Nominated for a 2009 Soap Opera Spirit Award as outstanding lead actor, St. John inarguably faced the most challenging assignment of any actor in 2008‚Äîin any genre,\\" said Branco. \\"And yet, somehow, St. John made it work. In a lesser actor's hands, the storyline most certainly would have resulted in career suicide for all involved.\\" Notes References  Works cited  *Brooks, Dianne L.

Wilhelm Willink had a summer estate on the Spaarne River, neighboring the estate villa Welgelegen of his associate Henry Hope. Biography Summer home of Willem Willink on the Spaarne river In the 18th century it became fashionable for Dutch businessmen to invest in the young United States, and many were talked into investing in land there after John Adams signed the trade treaty with the Netherlands in 1782. Around 1790 there were reportedly thirteen investors in the Holland Land Company syndicate, who hoped to profit by buying a large tract of land in Western New York and northern Pennsylvania and reselling it to settlers and businessmen. The other Holland Land Company investors included: the merchants Pieter and Christiaan van Eeghen; Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck, a lawyer and politician; Pieter Stadnitski; the brothers and bankers Jan, Roelof & Nicolaas van Staphorst; Hendrick Vollenhoven; Cornelius Vollenhoven; Hendrick Seye; Wilhelm Willink (the younger); Jan Willink; and Jan Willink (the younger). Robert Morris was involved in land dealings with the Holland Land Company. Willink's name was given to the Town of Willink when it was created from Batavia, New York in 1804. It was included in Niagara County when the latter was formed in 1808 from Genesee County. The Town of Willink, along with the Town of Clarence, was taken to form Erie County in 1821. The Town of Willink was then dispersed by the formation of newer towns in Erie County (such as Concord, Eden, and Aurora). Some of the investor names appear on the Big Tree Treaty of 1804, by which the Iroquois sold off their rights to most of the land in the Holland Purchase. The names of the investors were formerly given to locations in western New York, but they have since been replaced. Buffalo, New York itself was briefly called New Amsterdam. Stadnitski Avenue in Buffalo is now Church Street. Schimmelpenninck Avenue is now Niagara Street. Buffalo streets were also named after Willink and Van Staphorst. Their names appear as the original owners on most deeds for land in this part of New York. The syndicate hired agents to perform the work of selling and improving their land. Their principal agent was Theophilus Cazenove, later succeeded by Paolo Busti. Others agents were Joseph Ellicott, Adam Gerard Mappa, Benjamin Ellicott, William Peacock, and Gerrit Boon. In 1801 Willem and Jan Willink, merchants in Amsterdam, were enabled to purchase and hold real property in the town of Havre de Grace in Harford County. Ultimately, the syndicate earned only modest profit from the investment, but their funds greatly assisted the development of the United States.

Barred from seeking reelection due to term limits, the Democrat ran unsuccessfully in the Democratic primary for the opportunity to run against incumbent Republican Mayor, Michael Bloomberg in November 2005. Early life and education Miller grew up in New York City with mother Lynden B. Miller, a prominent landscape designer, and father Leigh Miller, who was a political appointee to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. Miller attended St. Bernard's School, a Manhattan day school for young boys. He graduated from Middlesex School and Princeton University, earning a degree in political science. Following his graduation from Princeton in 1992, Miller joined the staff of Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Democrat who represents the New York 14th Congressional District, which overlaps Council District 5. Council District 5 represents of the Upper East Side, Yorkville, Carnegie Hill, Turtle Bay, Sutton Place and Roosevelt Island. Miller dropped out of Fordham University Law School in 2000 to focus on his successful race for the New York City Council Speaker. Career In January 1996, Miller won his first term in the New York City Council at the age of 26. He was the first Democrat in recent history elected to represent the traditionally wealthy district. He easily won reelection in 1997, 2001 and 2003; term limits laws prohibited him from seeking a fifth term. Following a unanimous election on January 9, 2002, Miller succeeded Peter Vallone, Sr. as the Speaker of the New York City Council. Under Miller‚Äôs leadership the Council passed new laws to protect children from lead-paint poisoning, expanded civil rights, strengthened the City's campaign finance system and established tax credits to encourage greater energy savings and cleaner air. Miller led the Council in enacting some of the most sweeping changes in land use policy in the City's history. Miller set a new standard for affordable housing requirements as part of land use applications, broadening the use of inclusionary zoning. Miller pushed through historic rezonings for Manhattan's Far West Side and Chelsea districts and the Williamsburg-Greenpoint area. Miller provided invaluable leadership to the City during the fiscal crisis that followed the September 11 attacks. Faced with a $7.5 billion budget gap, Miller cut his own salary by ten percent, approved more than $3 billion in budget cuts overall, yet also successfully fought to protect critical public safety and emergency services. Miller sought the Democratic mayoral nomination in 2005. His opponents for the nomination included former Bronx borough president Fernando Ferrer, Congressman Anthony D. Weiner and outgoing Manhattan borough president C. Virginia Fields. The winner of the Democratic primary election on September 13, 2005 was Ferrer, who was easily defeated by Republican mayor Michael Bloomberg in the general election held on November 8, 2005. Miller was, according to a York Magazine article, barraged by local media, and politicos. Some claimed that Miller lacked the \\"ethnic base\\" necessary to be a successful politician in New York City-wide elections. According to the New York Observer, Miller is \\"widely regarded as a decent and talented man\\" who has nonetheless shown \\"signs of immaturity: his reversal on lead-paint legislation after pressure from special interests; his eagerness to spend the city budget surplus to hire teachers, reopen firehouses and cut taxes despite an ongoing climate of fiscal uncertainty\\".New York Observer article Although Miller had the most money of any of the candidates in the Democratic field, as well as many key endorsements, he suffered severe reversals of fortune in the final month of the primary. He failed to get backing from much of the entrenched local Democratic Party machinery. A news report concerning his voter-information mailings was released close to the primary election date. It was alleged that Gifford's aides initially originally stated the mailings cost only $37,000, but later stated they cost taxpayers $1.6 million (which was well within the average of mailing costs for City Council members). $37,000 would have been by far the lowest of all City Council members. While Miller's aide disputed that the figure $37,000 was ever offered, it had already been run as a news story during the election week. Miller also held that his $1.5 million of his fund was exempt from the primary's $5.7 million spending limit as it was self-financed which caused a spat with the New York City Campaign Finance Board. While Miller vigorously maintained his position, he ended the dispute by canceling over $500,000 in important final stage advertisements, negating his spending edge. Miller saw much of his potential support drift to Congressman Anthony Weiner. In the end, Miller placed fourth in the primary field with 10.19%. In the fall of 2006, Miller was a teacher at New York University's College of Arts and Science, leading a Freshman Honors Seminar, entitled \\"Governing Gotham\\" on public policy and urban planning in New York City. He also runs a strategic consulting firm, Miller Strategies, and a real estate investment firm. Miller serves on the board of a hedge fund and numerous non-profit groups, including Friends of the High Line, NYC Outward Bound and the New York Academy of Medicine. Personal life He lives in Manhattan with his wife, Pamela Addison, and their two sons, Marshall Legend and Addison Lad.

The film stars Kim Basinger as Celeste, an extraterrestrial woman sent on a secret mission to Earth, after her home planet's gravity is mistakenly disrupted by Steven Mills (Dan Aykroyd), a widowed scientist raising his daughter Jessie (Alyson Hannigan) as a single father. The film's screenplay was written by Herschel Weingrod, Timothy Harris, and Jonathan Reynolds, based on an earlier script by Jericho Stone, who originally pitched the film to Paramount Pictures as a drama that would serve as an allegory about child abuse. When Paramount optioned the story, they suggested that it would be more believable as a comedy. The film was unproduced for four years until Weintraub Entertainment Group put it into production in 1988. My Stepmother Is an Alien was a box-office bomb, grossing $13.8 million against a $19 million budget. The film also received negative reviews from critics, with most of the responses panning the film's humor and screenplay. Although, Basinger and costar Jon Lovitz generally received favorable reviews for their comedic performances. In the New York Times review, Aykroyd was singled out for criticism in his performance as a romantic lead. Plot Steven Mills is a widowed scientist working on different ways to send radio waves into deep space. After sending a radio wave out of the galaxy, it hits a planet (Cosine N to the 8th), causing a disruption of gravity on the planet. Celeste, a beautiful blonde woman, is sent to investigate who could have done it and how it was done, believing it was an attack. She is aided by a device called Bag: an alien tentacle with a single eye and a mind of its own disguised as a designer purse. Bag is able to create any object, such as diamonds and designer dresses almost instantaneously. Celeste crashes a party hosted by Steven's brother, Ron, and immediately draws attention to herself by making outdated references to TV shows and political slogans under the mistaken belief that they are current (information that had actually taken 92 years to get from Earth to her home world). Celeste's inexperience almost results in her exposing herself as alien as she struggles with simple tasks such as cooking and trying to kiss for the first time. She goes home with Steven and spends the night (after Bag teaches her what sex is and which she greatly enjoys). Jessie, Steven's 13-year-old daughter, is at first happy that her father has found someone (her mother having died five years previously), but becomes suspicious when she observes Celeste eating the acid out of batteries and pulling eggs out of boiling hot water with her bare hands. However, she cannot convince her smitten father that something is unusual about Celeste. When Celeste tells him that she must leave in 24 hours, he impulsively proposes, and she accepts. Ron also has his doubts about Celeste and tries to dissuade Steven from marrying her on the idea she is an illegal immigrant or planning economic espionage, but then admits he is just jealous his brother has found his dream girl, whereas he will never find a girl like Princess St√©phanie of Monaco. Celeste begins enjoying life as a human as she encounters new experiences such as sneezing and love. When Jessie finally confronts her about being an extraterrestrial, Celeste admits her home world has no emotion and that she plans to depart once she gets Steven to recreate the radio signal and send it (which she says will reverse the gravity problems on her world). However, she begins to question her decisions when Jessie says it will devastate her father, for whom Celeste has now developed feelings. After Jessie argues with Steven, she runs away and is nearly hit by a car but is saved by Celeste, revealing her powers. Steven accepts that Celeste is indeed an alien and that she has fallen in love with him and sees Jessie as her own daughter. He further ingratiates her to human society by showing her how to eat real food. Steven figures out how to recreate the radio wave and saves Celeste's planet. Bag, however, had been sent to Earth to destroy it and eliminate the danger to Celeste's world entirely. After throwing Bag into the power field of the wave transmitter (destroying Bag), the leaders of Celeste's home world report in and tell her to finish Bag's job. Steven and Celeste manage to convince them it was an accident, not an act of aggression, and that Earth has many benefits that require further studying. They accept the explanation and demand that Celeste return to explain human culture to them. Not wanting to leave, Celeste negotiates having a native of Earth become an ambassador to their world as a token of goodwill. Ron is selected and accepts; he departs for Celeste's world in a spaceship served by several flight attendants, all of whom look like Princess St√©phanie.

He pitched this version of the story to Paramount Pictures in 1981. Paramount agreed to option the story and paid him to write the screenplay, but felt it would be more believable as a comedy. On June 20, 1984, Variety reported that Catalina Production Group was planning to start principal photography on They're Coming in late 1984 for Paramount, naming the screenwriters as Stone and Richard Benner; actresses considered for the lead by Paramount included Bette Midler, Julie Andrews and Raquel Welch. Subsequently, the production moved to 20th Century Fox, which hired Herschel Weingrod and Timothy Harris to rewrite the screenplay. Fox considered Cybill Shepard and Joan Rivers for the role, but ultimately never produced the film, and it went into turnaround to Weintraub Entertainment Group, where the title was changed to Two Kids. Director Richard Benjamin read an unfinished version of the screenplay in the early 1980s, but did not become interested in the project until reading a completed draft he received via Weintraub in 1987, and agreed to direct. By 1988, the screenplay had received further rewriting by Jonathan Reynolds. Stone was ultimately credited only for the story, under his first name, Jericho. The film went into principal photography on 29 February 1988, and wrapped in May of that year; the total cost of production and marketing was reported as $26 million, with $19 million representing the production costs.  Release  A July press release for the film stated that My Stepmother Is An Alien would be released on November 23, 1988, but it was later pushed to December 9. The film premiered on December 3, 1988 in Washington, DC, an event attended by stars Aykroyd and Basinger, as well as President George H. W. Bush, First Lady Barbara Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle. Upon general release, Mayor of Los Angeles Tom Bradley declared December 9 ‚ÄúStepmother Day‚Äù, to honor the ‚Äúimportance, dedication, and contribution of stepmothers everywhere‚Äù, and an appreciation of the film shooting in Los Angeles. The film opened at number seven, grossing $2,066,980 in the opening weekend. It went on to gross $13,854,000 in the United States, becoming a box-office failure. Critical reviews The film was met with negative reviews. Roger Ebert wrote, \\"Basinger gets most of the good comic moments in the movie and does with them what she can, but Benjamin and his writers seem to have run short of invention. Most of the plot developments are foregone conclusions, and most of the big set pieces (like a wedding) are handled routinely, without inspiration.\\" Janet Maslin, reviewing the film for The New York Times, panned the film's screenplay and humor, as well as the performance of Dan Aykroyd, whom she felt was not only miscast as the film's romantic lead, but also unfunny. However, Maslin praised the performances of Kim Basinger and Jon Lovitz, whose character she categorized as a \\"scene-stealing sleazeball\\". In a generally favorable review, the LA Times criticized the film's sex humor, calling it \\"needlessly crass\\", but overall praised the film, writing, \\"My Stepmother Is an Alien is solid, wide-appeal holiday fare. It makes the best use of Aykroyd's warmth and proven talents in quite some time, and it does even more for Basinger, showing that she can be as funny and smart as she is sexy.\\" The Radio Times gave the film three out of five stars, writing, \\"Fine moments of inspired lunacy jostle with predictably slight comic relief, but Basinger's eager-to-please freshness and verve make this intergalactic muddle impossible to dislike.\\" Variety called the film a \\"failed attempt to mix many of the film genres associated with the 'alien' idea into a sprightly romp. TV Guide gave the film one star, calling it \\"A standard formula comedy [which] tries to emulate popular alien-on-Earth films like Starman. Had it actually been told from the perspective of the scientist's daughter, as the title suggests, it might have been more appealing, but instead a predictable, amateurish script shifts the focus elsewhere.\\" People said that director Richard Benjamin \\"tries to disguise the threadbare plot with explosions and special-effects hardware\\", and called the film \\"a clanking bore, except for Basinger‚Äîa potential star still waiting for the vehicle that will let her shine. Her comic talent glimmers in a scene where she learns what a kiss is\\". Time Out wrote, \\"The film offers several entertaining sequences, [but My Stepmother Is an Alien] is marred by cruel and juvenile gags.\\" The film has a score of 19% on Rotten Tomatoes.

The scale defines physical measurements of development based on external primary and secondary sex characteristics, such as the size of the breasts, genitals, testicular volume and development of pubic hair. This scale was first identified in 1969 by James Tanner, a British pediatrician, after a two- decade-long study following the physical changes in girls undergoing puberty. Due to natural variation, individuals pass through the Tanner stages at different rates, depending in particular on the timing of puberty. In HIV treatment, the Tanner scale is used to determine which regimen to follow for pediatric or adolescent patients on antiretroviral therapy (adult, adolescent, or pediatric guidelines). The Tanner scale has also been used in forensics to determine aging, but its usage has decreased due to lack of reliability. Definitions of stages Adapted from Adolescent Health Care: a practical guide by Lawrence Neinstein, M.D. Genitals (male) Illustration of the Tanner scale for males. ; Tanner I : testicular volume less than 1.5 ml; small penis (prepubertal; typically age nine and younger) ; Tanner II : testicular volume between 1.6 and 6 ml; skin on scrotum thins, reddens and enlarges; penis length unchanged (9‚Äì11) ; Tanner III : testicular volume between 6 and 12 ml; scrotum enlarges further; penis begins to lengthen (11‚Äì12.5) ; Tanner IV : testicular volume between 12 and 20 ml; scrotum enlarges further and darkens; penis increases in length (12.5‚Äì14) ; Tanner V : testicular volume greater than 20 ml; adult scrotum and penis (14+) Photos of the Tanner scale for males. Breasts (female) Photos of the Tanner scale for females. Illustration of the Tanner scale for females. ; Tanner I : no glandular tissue: areola follows the skin contours of the chest (prepubertal) (typically age 10 and younger) ; Tanner II : breast bud forms, with small area of surrounding glandular tissue; areola begins to widen (10‚Äì11.5) ; Tanner III : breast begins to become more elevated, and extends beyond the borders of the areola, which continues to widen but remains in contour with surrounding breast (11.5‚Äì13) ; Tanner IV : increased breast sizing and elevation; areola and papilla form a secondary mound projecting from the contour of the surrounding breast (13‚Äì15) ; Tanner V : breast reaches final adult size; areola returns to contour of the surrounding breast, with a projecting central papilla. (15+) Pubic hair (both male and female) ; Tanner I : no pubic hair at all (prepubertal) (typically age 10 and younger) ; Tanner II : small amount of long, downy hair with slight pigmentation at the base of the penis and scrotum (males) or on the labia majora (females) (10‚Äì11.5) ; Tanner III : hair becomes more coarse and curly, and begins to extend laterally (11.5‚Äì13) ; Tanner IV : adult-like hair quality, extending across pubis but sparing medial thighs (13‚Äì15) ; Tanner V : hair extends to medial surface of the thighs (15+) ; Height Growth Conclusion Sometime during Tanner 5, females stop growing and reach their adult height, usually this happens in their mid teens at 15 or 16 years for females. Males also stop growing and reach their adult height sometime during Tanner 5, usually this happens in their late teens at 18-19 years for males. Criticism The scale has been criticized by the pornography industry for its potential to lead to false child pornography convictions, such as in the case when United States federal authorities used it to assert that pornographic actress Lupe Fuentes was underage. Fuentes personally appeared at the trial and provided documentation that showed that the DVDs in question were legally produced. Tanner, the author of the classification system, has argued that age classification using the stages of the scale misrepresents the intended use. Tanner stages do not match with chronological age, but rather maturity stages and thus are not diagnostic for age estimation.

Early life and education  Ferrer grew up on Fox Street in the Longwood section of the South Bronx and was raised by his mother and by his grandmother, who worked in the kitchen of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Ferrer graduated from Catholic schools in the Bronx: St. Anselm Elementary School and Cardinal Spellman High School. As a high school student, he was a member of ASPIRA of New York, where he was elected to the post of Vice President of the citywide Aspira Clubs Federation (ACF), which included other future Puerto Rican leaders like Ninfa Segarra and Angelo Falc√≥n. In 1968, as an Aspirante, he was part of a major student protest at the NYC Board of Education that resulted in such reforms as bilingual report cards and the recognition by the public schools of Puerto Rican Discovery Day (November 19). His family have Catalan origins. He attended New York University where he got involved in community service as a student. Ferrer entered politics, and was elected to the New York City Council at the age of 32. Remembering how he had to translate for his grandmother when she was hospitalized, he authored legislation requiring interpreters in city emergency rooms. Ferrer went on to chair the Health Committee, fight for anti-discrimination laws on behalf of gays and lesbians, and lead the fight for a Civilian Complaint Review Board for the NYPD. Ferrer earned his B.A. degree from the University Heights Campus of New York University and M.P.A. from Baruch College.  Bronx Borough President  Ferrer was appointed Bronx Borough President as the result of incumbent Stanley Simon‚Äôs resignation in connection with the Wedtech scandal. In 1987, Simon, aware that he had been under investigation and that charges against him were pending, resigned from his post. A year earlier, bribery and extortion scandal at the Parking Violations Bureau took down then-Bronx Democratic Party boss Stanley Friedman. Ferrer began his 14-year tenure as Bronx borough president when the borough was a symbol of urban decay and neglect. National attention led to a federal commitment to rebuild. During the Ferrer administration housing was created for about 66,000 families. The borough saw a significant drop in crime, particularly in the South Bronx neighborhood, and a steady rise in business and real estate investment. In 1997, Ferrer launched a campaign for Mayor of New York. Trailing in the polls and under increased pressure from party insiders for a unified Democratic Party, he abruptly dropped out and endorsed the eventual Democratic nominee, Manhattan Borough President Ruth Messinger.  2001 mayoral campaign  In the 2001 election, Ferrer ran for the Democratic nomination for mayor. He won the first primary with 34%, but failed to win the necessary 40% to secure the nomination and ultimately lost a divisive runoff election to Mark Green following the September 11th terrorist attack on the World Trade Center towers. Ferrer, who is of Puerto Rican descent, received a high level of support from Hispanic voters but not from African-Americans. In the first round, Ferrer also finished ahead of City Council Speaker Peter Vallone and Comptroller Alan Hevesi.  2005 mayoral campaign  Ferrer was the Democratic candidate for mayor, losing in the general election to incumbent Mayor Michael Bloomberg in the 2005 election. During the campaign, Ferrer proposed reviving a stock transfer tax for Wall Street to help pay for education; this tax ended in 1981 but while different and smaller than the original tax was treated as if it were exactly the same. The tax had resulted in and been dropped as a result of threats by brokerage houses to move their operations base to New Jersey. Ferrer sought to create 167,000 homes, proposed hiring 1,900 new police officers, supported same-sex marriage, opposed the Urstadt law, supported the Second Avenue Subway and was opposed to tolls on the East River bridges as well as allowing residents of Staten Island to be able to cross the bridge connecting Staten Island to Brooklyn for free as other residents of other boroughs can do from their borough to others (such as the Brooklyn Bridge). On October 23, Ferrer proposed Home Owner Property Exemption, or HOPE, a tax break for homeowners with a home property value of less than $100,000 which would have more than doubled the property tax rebate given to NYers. A theme of his election campaign in 2001 was called the Two New Yorks and was altered for the 2005 campaign due to attacks that it was too race motivated. This is the conclusion of his stump speech: :This is not about one New York against the other, this is about building a city united in opportunity, where all of us live under the blessing of possibility. :There are two New Yorks. I have lived in both of them. Born in one, I crossed the bridge of hope and opportunity into the other, but I have never forgotten where I came from. :That bridge took me from shining shoes on 149th Street and Southern Boulevard to this place where possibility opened up for me. It took me from Fox Street to the nomination of the Democratic Party to be Mayor of my hometown. :It is that bridge that is the most important human infrastructure project, the bridge with planks of hope and opportunity that must be carefully maintained by a mayor who has never forgotten the millions of New Yorkers must be able to walk over that bridge too. :And I will never stop fighting for what I believe in until every New Yorker can cross that bridge ‚Äì and live in the greatest city in the world, with every opportunity they deserve, and where every dream‚Äîthe way my mother believed‚Äîis possible. His campaign was hurt by remarks he made in March 2005 concerning the Amadou Diallo shooting. Ferrer, who'd marched in protest against the shooting when it occurred and had gotten arrested, expressed his belief to the New York City Police Department Sergeants Benevolent Association that the incident was a \\"tragedy,\\" but \\"not a crime.\\" He was strongly criticized by Diallo's family and others for these remarks, and he slid in popularity polls, especially among African-Americans. These comments, although taken out of context, were never properly addressed and just followed the campaign the entire way. The comments and ensuing events also caused a long-time campaign consultant, from Chicago, and a new spokesperson, from Texas, to leave the campaign due to a power struggle over what to do. The new campaign team was made up of advisors from Ferrer's primary consulting firm, Global Strategy Group. In the primary election held on September 13, 2005, the first tally indicated that Ferrer garnered 39.95% of the final vote. He needed 40% to avoid a runoff, but Anthony D. Weiner, the second-place finisher, conceded, thus ensuring Ferrer would advance to the general election. A final count of the total votes indicated that Ferrer actually received 40.15% of the votes. Ferrer also defeated Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia Fields and City Council Speaker Gifford Miller. Over the course of the campaign he was endorsed by Attorney General and gubernatorial candidate Eliot Spitzer, Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Clinton, former Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Sen. John Edwards, as well as Howard Dean, Reverend Al Sharpton, the Working Families Party and former Mayor David Dinkins. Bill Clinton endorsed Ferrer on October 20. Despite the importance of the endorsement, local media such as 1010 WINS: emphasized minor snafus, arguing that \\"Ferrer's golden opportunity was nearly wasted as miscommunication between Clinton's office and Ferrer's campaign caused some snags and disarray.\\" This \\"problem\\" was due to an issue with a sound system. Political analyst Fred Siegel summarized Ferrer's campaign in The New Republic : :If anyone doubted the hapless nature of Ferrer's campaign they had only to watch his ads featuring the rotund Reverend Al Sharpton salsa dancing. In Fernando Ferrer's losing bid for mayor, that was about as innovative as things got. The campaign was also plagued by revenue problems as the ads they wished to use were too long and hence too expensive and these \\"salsa\\" ads were done to save money but also to hopefully get the campaign some needed attention. Sadly, the focus became Al Sharpton and the others used in these ads rather than the message they tried to convey. Ferrer's campaign was hurt when the New York Times and other big newspapers endorsed Mike Bloomberg. Also, Ferrer's campaign relied mainly on small contributions, compared to Bloomberg's $96 million from his personal billion dollar fortune. Bloomberg defeated Ferrer by a margin of 19 percent although pre-election polls done just days before had claimed that he would lose by between 30 and 35 percent with the New York Post declaring the weekend before the election that it was over. 2005 NYC Democratic ticket *Mayor: Fernando Ferrer *Public Advocate: Betsy Gotbaum *Comptroller: William Thompson Personal life Ferrer resides in the Riverdale section of the Bronx.\\"Profile: Fernando Ferrer\\", The New York Times, August 10, 2005.

It lies at the spot where the Orinoco River narrows to about in width, is the site of the first bridge across the river, and is a major riverport for the eastern regions of Venezuela. Historic Angostura gave its name to the Congress of Angostura, to the Angostura tree, to the House of Angostura, and to Angostura bitters. Modern Ciudad Bol√≠var has a well-preserved historic center; a cathedral and other original colonial buildings surround the Plaza Bol√≠var. History View of Ciudad Bol√≠var in 1912. Originally a Spanish settlement, it was called Saint Thomas of Guyana. The settlement was a fortified port which had to be moved on three occasions because it was constantly attacked by Carib natives and European rivals, such as the Dutch and English.Alexander von Humboldt, Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America During the Years 1799‚Äì1804, (chapter 25). Henry G. Bohn, London, 1853. In 1576 Saint Thomas of Guyana was first located in present-day Ciudad Guayana by missionaries near the Caron√≠ River until Dutch forces led by Captain Adrian Janson destroyed the town in 1579. The second settlement was founded by Don Antonio de Berr√≠o in 1595, who had arrived from the New Granada with the mission of colonizing Guiana, and was moved westward down the Caro≈Ñi about . One of Walter Raleigh's expeditions sacked the second settlement in 1617, resulting in the death of his son Watt Raleigh.John Hemming, The Search For El Dorado, Phoenix Press; 2nd ed. 31 December 2001; Ch. 10. Fernando de Berrio was present on March 11, 1619 in the destroyed Saint Thomas of Guyana with the credentials granted by the Royal Audience of Santa Fe, just a few months after the decapitation of Raleigh in 1618. The first task was the reconstruction of Saint Thomas of Guyana on the sides of Chirica, a more defensible and suitable place for tobacco cultivation. Berrio commissioned Captain Jer√≥nimo de Grados and Alonso de Monteros to recruit indigenous in the Esequibo River, but they were captured by British pirates for whose freedom they intended to collect a ransom translated into a few quintals of tobacco in branch. Finally Saint Thomas of Guyana was refounded by Fernando de Berrio in 1620. In 1629, English and Dutchs pirates, under the command of Adrian Jansz Pater, attacked and destroyed Saint Thomas of Guyana and afterwards fortified themselves in the branches and creeks of the Orinoco River. In 1637 the Dutchs, settled at the mouths of the Amakura, Essequibo and Berbice, again attacked and burned Saint Thomas of Guyana and raided Trinidad. The fourth and present day city was officially founded in 1764 by Don Joaquin Moreno de Mendoza as San Tomas de la Nueva Guayana, Santo Tom√© de Guayana de Angostura del Orinoco, or San Tom√© de Angostura, named in honor of its diocese and for its position at the first narrows of the Orinoco River. The Spanish relied on trade from the Dutch colony of Essequibo further down the Caron√≠ River until 1771. Angostura was the capital of Guayana Province and the site of the Congress of Angostura from 1819 to 1821. It was responsible for the creation of Gran Colombia in its first year of operation. Angostura bitters were invented in the city in 1824, although the company which produced them later moved to Trinidad and Tobago. The city was renamed in honor of Simon Bolivar in 1846. The Venezuelan artist Jes√∫s Rafael Soto was a native of the city. The Jes√∫s Soto Museum of Modern Art, named in his honor and designed by Venezuelan architect Carlos Ra√∫l Villanueva, was opened in 1973. Law and government Ciudad Bol√≠var's municipal government is led by the mayor. Its local legislature is the Municipal Council, made up of seven councillors. A municipal comptroller oversees the public finances, and the Local Public Planning Council manages the municipality's development.Law and government Geography Vegetation Moriche palms and scrub oaks are found on the shores of the river. Species including the carob tree, the sarrapia (tonka bean), and the merecure are prevalent. Local fauna include capybaras, turtles, herons, parrots, limpets, and iguanas, and others. Fish in the area include Salminus hilarii (a species of Salminus) and Pygocentrus palometa.

Life and career  Theophilus Cazenove was born in Amsterdam on 13 October 1740, as the son of Th√©ophile Cazenove and Marie de Rapin-Thoyras, French/Swiss Huguenots. His father was a merchant and banker in Bordeaux, Saint Petersburg, Archangelsk, Stockholm and the West-Indies; in 1759 he lost four ships loaded with sugar and coffee, which were taken by a Bristol privateer. In 1760, the elder Th√©ophile gave up his business and his sons Charles and Theophile assumed control of the company. Career Cazenove spent his early career in commercial transactions in France and Russia, but went broke in 1770. In the same year, his portrait was painted by Jean- Baptiste Perronneau.http://www.pastellists.com/Genealogies/Cazenove.pdf After the death of his father-in-law he was involved in a plantation in Surinam. In 1788, he collaborated with √âtienne Clavi√®re and Jacques Pierre Brissot, who both traveled to the United States. In November 1789, Cazenove was retained by Pieter Stadnitski to travel to the United States to act as an investment agent for Stadnitski and other Dutch investors (Nicolaas and Jacob Van Staphorst, Pieter & Christiaen Van Eeghen, and Ten Cate & Vollenhoven).http://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/archieven/archiefbank/overzicht/333.nl.htmlhttp://www.onserfdeel.be/nl/uit_archief_detail.asp?artikel_id=14060 Casenove settled in at Market Street in Philadelphia, where he dealt with financier Robert Morris; his fellow traveller Gerrit Boon later went north. Boon believed that harvesting maple syrup could be a year-round activity, so slavery on the sugarcane plantations could be avoided. In 1792, Cazenove invested his clients' money in development bonds issued by the new states and the federal government, after Alexander Hamilton promised to fully pay the debt. Another venture included investing in large tracts of undeveloped land in Genesee County, New York, which included the Holland Purchase. In order to implement these large and difficult purchases (sometimes complicated by the claims of Native Americans), he employed the advisory services of Hamilton and, later, Aaron Burr. Cazenove lived well as a \\"grand seigneur\\" and was known for his extreme carelessness. His business dealings in maple syrup and canals were not particularly successful and the investors barely made any profit, even losing money in the Pennsylvania land dealings which he organized with James Wilson. He was also hard pressed to account for funds that were under his control. During this period he helped his cousin from Geneva, Antoine Charles Cazenove, settle in Philadelphia. Alexander Baring wrote: \\"Cazenove is a sad dirty fellow and does all the mischief he can.\\" In 1798, he hired Joseph Ellicott, but Paolo Busti became his successor. Although he became an American citizen in 1794, Cazenove returned to Europe in 1799. In Amsterdam, he began to archive purchase of land for the financiers. He left the employment of the Dutch investors in 1802 and sought a position under Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P√©rigord, who he had met in Philadelphia in 1795, when also Talleyrand invested in land purchase. Personal life In 1763, Theophile married Margaretha Helena van Jever (1747‚Äì1833), the daughter of a tradesman in Russia, and a member of the vroedschap. Cazenove died on 6 March 1811 in Paris in the Rue du Bac.  Legacy  Cazenove's correspondence, along with the records of the Holland Land Company, are held in the Amsterdam City Archives. A number of places in New York are named after him, including the Village of Cazenovia, Town of Cazenovia, Cazenovia College, Cazenovia Lake, and Cazenovia Creek.

Lemon & Paeroa is a popular drink in New Zealand. It is also available in Coles supermarkets in Australia, in Gourmet Burger Kitchen restaurants in the United Kingdom, and in some specialty stores. L&P; is also used as a mixer in New Zealand bars, particularly with Southern Comfort. The comically pretentious advertising slogan \\"World famous in New Zealand\\" has become a popular New Zealand saying.

In 2005 \\"Sweet As L&P;\\" with artificial sweetener aspartame was introduced with the modified slogan \\"World Famous in New Zealand since quite recently\\", and the traditional product began being advertised as \\"World Famous in New Zealand since Ages ago\\". History The Giant L & P bottle in Paeroa, showing the label design as used from the 1970s to the 1990s. Analysis of Paeroa mineral water by Arthur Wohlman in 1904 revealed magnesium bicarbonate in a concentration of 73 grains to the gallon (1040 mg/L). In 1908 the property containing the mineral spring was purchased by Robert Fewell and his brother- in-law Frank Brinkler. Their company Paeroa Natural Mineral Water Company, bottled the spring water until 1915 when they sold the company to Menzies and Company who, in turn, opened a new factory in Paeroa in 1926. In the late 1940s 'Lemon and Paeroa' and 'Paeroa and Lemon' were both marketed. In 1963 Menzies and Co merged with Hamilton-based bottlers CL Innes, and L&P; took on the Innes Tartan as a motif on the neck of the L&P; bottle. This continued until the late 1970s, when L&P; was taken over by Oasis Industries, before it was, in turn, taken over by Coca-Cola. In the early 1960s, a collaboration of New Zealand music artists recorded a cover of Martha and the Vandellas song (Love is Like A) Heat Wave, to promote the drink. L&P; itself is now made by Coca-Cola in Auckland, on the same production line as the company's other beverages. However, there is a giant L&P; bottle in Paeroa near the site where the product was originally manufactured. The company has also licensed an official L&P; Kiwiana shop and caf√©.

The retrieval of memory has been theorized to be untrustworthy, and it can be partially inaccurate and not totally reliable (see more: Recovered memory.) Ubiquitous Memory Systems have been invented in order to reduce these memory mistakes. A study conducted by students of the Information Science Department in Nara, Japan sought to measure different types of memory augmentation. They used a computer system, the \\"Ubiquitous Memories,\\" to demonstrate if the technology aided to augmentation better than other methods such as notes with a pen and paper, portraits used in a previous trial experiment, and just plain human memory. The results were that the Ubiquitous Memories aided in retrieving memory, and decreased the likelihood of mistakes in comparison to other methods. Some researchers have even gone so far as to create mixed-reality simulations to assist individuals in improving their memories. Many of these systems implement the method of loci which involves using the spatial layout of a familiar place to help individuals remember certain things. For example, one might attempt to remember a packing list for a trip by imagining the items around their room. Memory augmentation not only refers to our ability to recall information accurately, it also refers to our ability to encode long-term information quickly. Some researchers suggest that through using augmented reality interfaces, we have the ability to memorize information and store it in our long-term memory after only being exposed to it once. Specifically, the function of these interfaces is to stimulate parts of the brain that are essential to memory such as the hippocampus, neocortex, and entorhinal cortex which would result in the acquisition of episodic memory for things we would normally use long-term semantic memory to recall.  Approaches to human memory  The traditional approach to memory is often what most people think of when they consider memory functions. This describes the instances in which individuals rely on areas of the brain, such as the hippocampus and the frontal lobe, to function properly in order to maximize memory. However, the situated approach relies on external memory aids and environmental cues. Another approach to human memory augmentation is using devices such as cell phones to capture videos and pictures of various life events and experiences. These pictures and videos can serve as retrieval cues for not only that particular instance but also for other memories associated with the time the picture or video was taken. In addition to this, it is suggested that keeping journal entries of important life events, writing to-do lists, and keeping an updated calendar can all assist in augmenting memory. Researchers have recently been studying the concept of lifelogging, which refers to the ability to continuously film one‚Äôs life through wearable cameras. This would increase the human capacity to remember events correctly because it would allow the individual to go back and replay parts of their life that they have forgotten. When it comes to visual memory, some researchers believe that it is possible to know what someone is paying attention to, and therefore to know what they will remember simply by tracking what they are looking at. In other words, when an individual is not looking at something, they are not paying attention and therefore will be less likely to remember what they were not looking at.  Memory augmentation and aging  Memory augmentation techniques can vary in effectiveness between age groups. Children tend to have an easier time learning and remembering new information, while older adults often have a more difficult time learning new information. Because there is often a decline in memory abilities as individuals age, the traditional approach to memory is not always most effective. Rather, external environmental cues have been found to be more effective when it comes to memory augmentation of the elderly. Researchers have also suggested that in order to improve the memory augmentation of older adults, the pace at which the individual learns may need to be slowed down in order to allow for them to fully process the information being presented. In addition to this, it is suggested that learners should be vigilant about organizing their learning materials. This could include creating a tidy learning environment as well. Imagery techniques such as using the method of loci for example also assists in the augmentation of memory in older adults. In addition to this, mnemonics can be used to remember lists of items. It is also important for older adults to learn in supportive environments that encourage them to try their best while not subjecting them to unnecessary pressure to remember. As with individuals of any age, if there is a high amount of pressure to remember certain concepts or items in a list, the individual will have a more difficult time remembering them. It is also essential for older adults to know what types of memory changes are and are not normal as they age.  Memory improvement strategies  There are four different strategies many individuals use to improve and augment their long- term memories, which are: 1\\\\. Nootropics: substances which can be consumed in an attempt to enhance memory encoding as well as retrieval. Nootropics are typically prescription medications such as Ritalin and Adderall which are used to treat various disorders such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Any type of substance which includes any form of psychoactive compounds can also be considered a nootropic. For example, the compounds found in energy drinks such as caffeine and taurine have also been shown to improve cognitive functioning, and in turn, improve memory. 2\\\\. Brain stimulation: transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be used to stimulate certain brain regions associated with memory in a non-invasive way. This causes those areas to be more activated than other areas of the brain when an individual is trying to remember something. This, however, requires special equipment only accessible in a laboratory and therefore cannot be used at home. 3\\\\. Mnemonics: commonly used memory techniques which involve strategies such as repetition, creating memorable phrases or words with the first letter of every word one wants to remember, using visual imagery, or creating a story involving the things which are necessary to remember. 4\\\\. External aids: memory technique that involves writing down what one wants to remember. Making lists and reminders to ourselves often can be beneficial in enhancing our abilities to remember more items for longer periods of time. Ubiquitous memories system The Ubiquitous memories system contains two advantages: # Cognitive design (vs. subliminal vs. rehearsal): It is a new design in the system to recover problems. Cognitive design was demonstrated in a study conducted by DeVaul et al. The user can operate the cognitive load by him/her self to arrange his/her memories in both controllable conscious and unconscious cognitive traits. This design recover the problems in subliminal and rehearsal operation that memory augmentation will be hard to obtain when the user is over-supported by the operations. # Touching operation: Physically touching objects rather than simply looking at them can better aid an individual‚Äôs memory of that object because he or she now has tactile experience with it. In order to select an object, the system must detect the object under the two conditions: 1:Dense/dust-covered object; a dense object is an object that is one of thickly gathered objects or one of piled object; a dust- covered object represents an object is not used often. 6 Procedures illustrate the Ubiquitous memories system: # A user perceives an event via his/her body. # The perceived event is stored into his/her brain as a memory. # The human body is used as media for propagating memories. # The transferred memory remains in the object. # He/she transfers the memory from the object to his/her body when interested in the object and then touches the object again. # He/she can recall the event.

It resembles a bee with rotating wings that move and make a clicking noise while the toy is pulled along the ground. Possibly based on an earlier American concept, it was designed and first produced in New Zealand in the 1930s, by Maurice Schlesinger.Williams, Tony (2007). 101 Incredible Kiwis: How New Zealanders Lead the World. Auckland: Reed Publishing. It became popular during the post- war baby boom. Its bright colours and clicking sound call are familiar to many New Zealanders, making it one of the most well-recognised items of Kiwiana. Since this time however, the Buzzy Bee has branched out into various merchandise including books, puzzle and clothing. Toys Fisher-Price manufactured Buzzy Bees from 1950 to 1956. Buzzy Bee was originally covered with paper lithographs depicting a yellow bee with pink cheeks, blue eyes, and striped tail. The bee had two spring antennae topped with red beads. Yellow acetate wings rotated and the toy made a \\"buzz-buzz\\" sound as it was pulled along on two wooden wheels.Buzzy Bee This Old ToyRich, Mark. Warman's 101 Greatest Baby Boomer Toys. kp books, 2005. Buzzy Bee cost $.59 and was Fisher- Price's first toy to feature plastic. The toy was retired for a few years but returned in 1956 as Queen Buzzy Bee wearing a polyethylene crown. Queen Buzzy was manufactured until the mid-1980s. Promotion It received a good deal of free promotion with the visit of The Prince and Princess of Wales in 1983 with their infant son, Prince William of Wales, who played with a Buzzy Bee. As an iconic New Zealand symbol, the Buzzy Bee caricature was used on the keel of NZL84, one of Emirates Team New Zealand's entrant yachts for the America's Cup held in Valencia, Spain, in 2007. Adaptations In June 2007, plans were unveiled for a Buzzy Bee stage show \\"Buzzy Bee's Big Day Out\\". The company behind the show also revealed that they'd made an animated show reel and were finalising details of a distribution deal, and that they hoped to begin work on an animated series for television. An animated TV show, Buzzy Bee and Friends, premiered on TV2 in 2009. 52 episodes were produced.

Although commonly referenced in popular culture, studies have not empirically demonstrated the existence of these stages, and the model is considered to be outdated, inaccurate, and unhelpful in explaining the grieving process. The model was introduced by Swiss-American psychiatrist Elisabeth K√ºbler-Ross in her 1969 book On Death and Dying, and was inspired by her work with terminally ill patients. Motivated by the lack of instruction in medical schools on the subject of death and dying, K√ºbler-Ross examined death and those faced with it at the University of Chicago's medical school. K√ºbler-Ross's project evolved into a series of seminars which, along with patient interviews and previous research, became the foundation for her book. Although K√ºbler-Ross is commonly credited with creating stage models, earlier bereavement theorists and clinicians such as Erich Lindemann, Collin Murray Parkes, and John Bowlby used similar models of stages of phases as early as the 1940s. Later in her life, K√ºbler-Ross noted that the stages are not a linear and predictable progression and that she regretted writing them in a way that was misunderstood. \\"K√ºbler-Ross originally saw these stages as reflecting how people cope with illness and dying,\\" observed grief researcher Kenneth J. Doka, \\"not as reflections of how people grieve.\\"  Stages of grief  A diagram developed by Bertrand Grondin from a presentation of K√ºbler-Ross' ideas produced by France Telecom Diagram showing two possible outcomes of grief or a life-changing event developed for Jobcentre Plus by Eos K√ºbler-Ross originally developed stages to describe the process patients with terminal illness go through as they come to terms with their own deaths; it was later applied to grieving friends and family as well, who seemed to undergo a similar process. The stages, popularly known by the acronym DABDA, include: #Denial ‚Äì The first reaction is denial. In this stage, individuals believe the diagnosis is somehow mistaken, and cling to a false, preferable reality. #Anger ‚Äì When the individual recognizes that denial cannot continue, they become frustrated, especially at proximate individuals. Certain psychological responses of a person undergoing this phase would be: \\"Why me? It's not fair!\\"; \\"How can this happen to me?\\"; \\"Who is to blame?\\"; \\"Why would this happen?\\". #Bargaining ‚Äì The third stage involves the hope that the individual can avoid a cause of grief. Usually, the negotiation for an extended life is made in exchange for a reformed lifestyle. People facing less serious trauma can bargain or seek compromise. Examples include the terminally ill person who \\"negotiates with God\\" to attend a daughter's wedding, an attempt to bargain for more time to live in exchange for a reformed lifestyle or a phrase such as \\"If I could trade their life for mine\\". #Depression ‚Äì \\"I'm so sad, why bother with anything?\\"; \\"I'm going to die soon, so what's the point?\\"; \\"I miss my loved one; why go on?\\" During the fourth stage, the individual despairs at the recognition of their mortality. In this state, the individual may become silent, refuse visitors and spend much of the time mournful and sullen. #Acceptance ‚Äì \\"It's going to be okay.\\"; \\"I can't fight it; I may as well prepare for it.\\" In this last stage, individuals embrace mortality or inevitable future, or that of a loved one, or other tragic event. People dying may precede the survivors in this state, which typically comes with a calm, retrospective view for the individual, and a stable condition of emotions. In a book co-authored with David Kessler and published posthumously, K√ºbler-Ross expanded her model to include any form of personal loss, such as the death of a loved one, the loss of a job or income, major rejection, the end of a relationship or divorce, drug addiction, incarceration, the onset of a disease or an infertility diagnosis, and even minor losses, such as a loss of insurance coverage. Kessler has also proposed \\"Meaning\\" as a sixth stage of grief. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Kessler applied the five stages to responses to the virus, saying: \\"It's not a map but it provides some scaffolding for this unknown world.\\" > \\"There's denial, which we saw a lot of early on: This virus won't affect us. > There's anger: You're making me stay home and taking away my activities. > There's bargaining: Okay, if I social distance for two weeks everything will > be better, right? There's sadness: I don't know when this will end. And > finally there's acceptance. This is happening; I have to figure out how to > proceed. Acceptance, as you might imagine, is where the power lies. We find > control in acceptance. I can wash my hands. I can keep a safe distance. I > can learn how to work virtually.\\" Criticism Criticisms of this five-stage model of grief center mainly on a lack of empirical research and empirical evidence supporting the stages as described by K√ºbler-Ross and, to the contrary, empirical support for other modes of the expression of grief. Moreover, K√ºbler-Ross' model is the product of a particular culture at a particular time and might not be applicable to people of other cultures. These points have been made by many experts, including Professor Robert J. Kastenbaum (1932‚Äì2013) who was a recognized expert in gerontology, aging, and death. In his writings, Kastenbaum raised the following points: * The existence of these stages as such has not been demonstrated. * No evidence has been presented that people actually do move from Stage 1 through Stage 5. * The limitations of the method have not been acknowledged. * The line is blurred between description and prescription. * The resources, pressures, and characteristics of the immediate environment, which can make a tremendous difference, are not taken into account. A widely cited 2003 study of bereaved individuals conducted by Maciejewski and colleagues at Yale University obtained some findings consistent with a five- stage hypothesis but others inconsistent with it. Several letters were also published in the same journal criticizing this research and arguing against the stage idea. It was pointed out, for example, that instead of \\"acceptance\\" being the final stage of grieving, the data actually showed it was the most frequently endorsed item at the first and every other time point measured; that cultural and geographical bias within the sample population was not controlled for; and that out of the total number of participants originally recruited for the study, nearly 40% were excluded from the analysis who did not fit the stage model. In subsequent work, Prigerson & Maciejewski focused on acceptance (emotional and cognitive) and backed away from stages, writing that their earlier results \\"might more accurately be described as 'states' of grief.\\" George Bonanno, Professor of Clinical Psychology at Columbia University, in his book The Other Side of Sadness: What the New Science of Bereavement Tells Us About Life After a Loss, summarizes peer-reviewed research based on thousands of subjects over two decades and concludes that a natural psychological resilience is a principal component of grief and that there are no stages of grief to pass. Bonanno's work has also demonstrated that absence of grief or trauma symptoms is a healthy outcome. Among social scientists, another criticism is a lack of theoretical underpinning. Because the stages arose from anecdotes and not underlying theoretical principles it contains conceptual confusion. For example, some stages represent emotions while other represent cognitive processes. Also, there is no rationale for arbitrary dividing lines between states. On the other hand, there are other theoretically based, scientific perspectives that better represent the course of grief and bereavement such as: trajectories approach, cognitive stress theory, meaning making approach, psychosocial transition model, two-track model, dual process model, and the task model. Misapplication can be harmful if it leads bereaved persons to feel that they are not coping appropriately or it can result in ineffective support by members of their social network and/or health care professionals. The stages were originally meant to be descriptive but over time became prescriptive. Some caregivers dealt with clients who were distressed that they did not experience the stages in \\"the right order\\" or failed to experience one or more of the stages of grief. Criticism and lack of support in peer-reviewed research or objective clinical observation by many practitioners in the field has led to the labels of myth and fallacy in the notion that there are stages of grief. Nevertheless, the model's use has persisted in popular news and entertainment media.

At the 2016 Census, Christmas Hills had a population of 355. Christmas Hills is located between Kangaroo Ground and Yarra Glen, along Eltham-Yarra Glen Road (State Route C726), north of the Yarra River, in the Dandenong Ranges. In 1904, the Australian Handbook described Christmas Hills as \\"an excellent health resort\\". The locality is very hilly, with One Tree Hill in the northwest rising to 372 m above sea level, and is home to several reserves, including One Tree Hill Reserve and Sugarloaf Reservoir Park, opened in 1980 and managed by Melbourne Water. History Christmas Hills owes its name to an emancipated convict and shepherd, David Christmas, who became lost on a grazing lease in the area in 1842, and was found after days of wandering at a rise which was subsequently named after him. The area was considered to have poor quality soil, although nearby settlers earned an income from chopping firewood in the sclerophyll forests. Gold was discovered at One Tree Hill in 1859, fuelling a brief goldrush. Quartz reef operations ended in 1864, and alluvial mining continued until 1908. The area grew considerably in the 1870s; at one point the town had two hotels, two schools, a post office and a Mechanics' Institute. The Post Office opened on 10 December 1874 as Christmas Hill, was renamed in 1913, and closed in 1974. In 1884, a primary school was built, and by 1912, when the railway from Heidelberg to Hurstbridge was built, the area had a population of 146 and had become a tourist destination, popular with Melburnians seeking \\"clean air and an invigorating climate\\". In 1893, 1939, 1962 and 2009, the area suffered from destructive bushfires. Present Day Christmas Hills today is a large area encompassing several districts. Christmas Hills township The Christmas Hills township consists of a cluster of homes, a public hall, a tennis court, a memorial park with a World War I monument and a fire brigade shed, erected after the 1939 bushfires. About 1 km to the west is Christmas Hills Primary School, first established in 1884, with an enrolment of 22 students in 2006.Schools Online listing, Department of Education (Victoria). Accessed 25 November 2006. A mobile library service managed by Yarra Plenty Regional Library visits the community, parked at the school regularly. Rob Roy Rob Roy () in the western part is used for a range of hill racing events by the MG Car Club of Victoria. It was first established in 1937 by motoring enthusiasts and the Light Car Club for hill-racing motorbikes and cars and was utilised as a venue well into the postwar years. Initially a dirt track, it was fully bitumenised in 1939. It was burnt out in 1962, and abandoned. The MGCC took out a lease on the property in 1992, and rebuilt all the facilities, running the first meeting of the \\"modern era\\" in February 1993. One Tree Hill One Tree Hill (), a former mining area in northwestern Christmas Hills, is now a 143 hectare reserve managed by Parks Victoria. Its main features are Happy Valley Creek, which runs through the reserve, and the 372 m One Tree Hill in the northeast. According to the Land Conservation Council of Victoria, Available at Redmond Barry Reading Room, State Library of Victoria. it has been assessed as \\"being of State botanical significance for its ecological integrity and viability, rarity and representation of community types\\", and is home to 22 species assessed as regionally threatened, rare or restricted in the greater Melbourne area, including roosting colonies of large bent-wing bat and eastern horseshoe bat, and the powerful owl, brush-tailed phascogale and barking owl. (131 pages) Available at State Library of Victoria. The LCC reports that 79 bird, 24 mammal, 7 reptile and 7 frog species have been recorded in the reserve. Sugarloaf Reservoir Sugarloaf Reservoir () is a 440-hectare reservoir which has a total water capacity of 96,000 megalitres, and was developed in the late 1970s and completed in 1981. It is managed by Melbourne Water and supplies scheme water to Melbourne's northern, western and inner suburbs. Sugarloaf is fed by the Maroondah Aqueduct and the Yarra River, and before entering the domestic water supply, water is treated at the Winneke Water Treatment Plant on the south bank of the reservoir to World Health Organization guidelines. The main dam is 89 m high and 1,050 m long. Around the reservoir is the Sugarloaf Reservoir Park, which opened in 1982 and is managed by Parks Victoria. The park's entrance, open during most daylight hours, is 1.2 km off Eltham-Yarra Glen Road. Barbecue and picnic facilities are available at Saddle Dam, south-east of the dam wall, and Ridge Park to the North. Several walking trails can be used with permission of Parks Victoria. Watercraft are only permitted to launch from the Sugarloaf Sailing Club on the north bank, and sail boards, keel boats and/or craft with cabins, cooking or toilet facilities are not permitted on the Reservoir.Sugarloaf Sailing Club The area is home to eastern grey kangaroos, echidnas, wedge-tailed eagles, crimson rosellas and other wildlife including a population of deer. Vegetation ranges from grassland, having been cleared for agriculture in the decades prior to the reservoir's construction, to dry forest. Transport The nearest public transport is by bus to Yarra Glen 9 km downhill to the east. However, driving is a much more viable option, considering the time and distance taken to use public transport, and spread of the towns.

It can also be a form of wireless ad hoc network.Chai Keong Toh Ad Hoc Mobile Wireless Networks, Prentice Hall Publishers, 2002. A mesh refers to rich interconnection among devices or nodes. Wireless mesh networks often consist of mesh clients, mesh routers and gateways. Mobility of nodes is less frequent. If nodes constantly or frequently move, the mesh spends more time updating routes than delivering data. In a wireless mesh network, topology tends to be more static, so that routes computation can converge and delivery of data to their destinations can occur. Hence, this is a low-mobility centralized form of wireless ad hoc network. Also, because it sometimes relies on static nodes to act as gateways, it is not a truly all-wireless ad hoc network. Mesh clients are often laptops, cell phones, and other wireless devices. Mesh routers forward traffic to and from the gateways, which may, but need not, be connected to the Internet. The coverage area of all radio nodes working as a single network is sometimes called a mesh cloud. Access to this mesh cloud depends on the radio nodes working together to create a radio network. A mesh network is reliable and offers redundancy. When one node can no longer operate, the rest of the nodes can still communicate with each other, directly or through one or more intermediate nodes. Wireless mesh networks can self form and self heal. Wireless mesh networks work with different wireless technologies including 802.11, 802.15, 802.16, cellular technologies and need not be restricted to any one technology or protocol. See also mesh networking. Features Architecture Wireless mesh architecture is a first step towards providing cost effective and low mobility over a specific coverage area. Wireless mesh infrastructure is, in effect, a network of routers minus the cabling between nodes. It is built of peer radio devices that do not have to be cabled to a wired port like traditional WLAN access points (AP) do. Mesh infrastructure carries data over large distances by splitting the distance into a series of short hops. Intermediate nodes not only boost the signal, but cooperatively pass data from point A to point B by making forwarding decisions based on their knowledge of the network, i.e. perform routing by first deriving the topology of the network. Wireless mesh networks is a relatively \\"stable-topology\\" network except for the occasional failure of nodes or addition of new nodes. The path of traffic, being aggregated from a large number of end users, changes infrequently. Practically all the traffic in an infrastructure mesh network is either forwarded to or from a gateway, while in wireless ad hoc networks or client mesh networks the traffic flows between arbitrary pairs of nodes.J. Jun, M.L. Sichitiu, \\"The nominal capacity of wireless mesh networks\\", in IEEE Wireless Communications, vol 10, 5 pp 8-14. October 2003 If rate of mobility among nodes are high, i.e., link breaks happen frequently, wireless mesh networks start to break down and have low communication performance. Management This type of infrastructure can be decentralized (with no central server) or centrally managed (with a central server).S.M. Chen, P, Lin, D-W Huang, S-R Yang, \\"A study on distributed/centralized scheduling for wireless mesh network\\" in Proceedings of the 2006 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing, pp 599 - 604. Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. 2006 Both are relatively inexpensive, and can be very reliable and resilient, as each node needs only transmit as far as the next node. Nodes act as routers to transmit data from nearby nodes to peers that are too far away to reach in a single hop, resulting in a network that can span larger distances. The topology of a mesh network must be relatively stable, i.e., not too much mobility. If one node drops out of the network, due to hardware failure or any other reason, its neighbors can quickly find another route using a routing protocol. Applications Mesh networks may involve either fixed or mobile devices. The solutions are as diverse as communication needs, for example in difficult environments such as emergency situations, tunnels, oil rigs, battlefield surveillance, high-speed mobile-video applications on board public transport, real-time racing-car telemetry, or self-organizing Internet access for communities. An important possible application for wireless mesh networks is VoIP. By using a quality of service scheme, the wireless mesh may support routing local telephone calls through the mesh. Most applications in wireless mesh networks are similar to those in wireless ad hoc networks. Some current applications: * U.S. military forces are now using wireless mesh networking to connect their computers, mainly ruggedized laptops, in field operations. * Electric smart meters now being deployed on residences, transfer their readings from one to another and eventually to the central office for billing, without the need for human meter readers or the need to connect the meters with cables. * The laptops in the One Laptop per Child program use wireless mesh networking to enable students to exchange files and get on the Internet even though they lack wired or cell phone or other physical connections in their area. * Google Home, Google Wi-Fi, and Google OnHub all support Wi-Fi mesh (i.e., Wi-Fi ad hoc) networking. Several manufacturers of Wi-Fi routers began offering mesh routers for home use in the mid-2010s. * The 66-satellite Iridium constellation operates as a mesh network, with wireless links between adjacent satellites. Calls between two satellite phones are routed through the mesh, from one satellite to another across the constellation, without having to go through an earth station. This makes for a smaller travel distance for the signal, reducing latency, and also allows for the constellation to operate with far fewer earth stations than would be required for 66 traditional communications satellites. Operation The principle is similar to the way packets travel around the wired Internet‚Äîdata hops from one device to another until it eventually reaches its destination. Dynamic routing algorithms implemented in each device allow this to happen. To implement such dynamic routing protocols, each device needs to communicate routing information to other devices in the network. Each device then determines what to do with the data it receives ‚Äì either pass it on to the next device or keep it, depending on the protocol. The routing algorithm used should attempt to always ensure that the data takes the most appropriate (fastest) route to its destination. Multi-radio mesh Multi-radio mesh refers to having different radios operating at different frequencies to interconnect nodes in a mesh. This means there is a unique frequency used for each wireless hop and thus a dedicated CSMA collision domain. With more radio bands, communication throughput is likely to increase as a result of more available communication channels. This is similar to providing dual or multiple radio paths to transmit and receive data. Research topics One of the more often cited papers on Wireless Mesh Networks identified the following areas as open research problems in 2005 * New modulation scheme ** To achieve higher transmission rate requires new wideband transmission schemes other than OFDM and UWB. * Advanced antenna processing ** Advanced antenna processing including directional, smart and multiple antenna technologies is further investigated, since their complexity and cost are still too high for wide commercialization. * Flexible spectrum management ** Tremendous efforts on research of frequency-agile techniques are being performed for increased efficiency. * Cross-layer optimization ** Cross- layer research is a popular current research topic where information is shared between different communications layers to increase the knowledge and current state of the network. This could facilitate development of new and more efficient protocols. A joint protocol that addresses various design problems‚Äîrouting, scheduling, channel assignment etc.‚Äîcan achieve higher performance since these problems are strongly co-related. Note that careless cross-layer design can lead to code that is difficult to maintain and extend. * Software-defined wireless networking ** Centralized, distributed, or hybrid? - In a new SDN architecture for WDNs is explored that eliminates the need for multi-hop flooding of route information and therefore enables WDNs to easily expand. The key idea is to split network control and data forwarding by using two separate frequency bands. The forwarding nodes and the SDN controller exchange link-state information and other network control signaling in one of the bands, while actual data forwarding takes place in the other band. * Security ** A WMN can be seen as a group of nodes (clients or routers) that cooperate to provide connectivity. Such an open architecture, where clients serve as routers to forward data packets, is exposed to many types of attacks that can interrupt the whole network and cause denial of service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). Protocols Routing protocols There are more than 70 competing schemes for routing packets across mesh networks. Some of these include: *Associativity-Based Routing (ABR) *AODV (Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector) *B.A.T.M.A.N. (Better Approach To Mobile Adhoc Networking) *Babel (protocol) (a distance-vector routing protocol for IPv6 and IPv4 with fast convergence properties) *Dynamic NIx-Vector RoutingDNVR *DSDV (Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector Routing) *DSR (Dynamic Source Routing) *HSLS (Hazy-Sighted Link State) *HWMP (Hybrid Wireless Mesh Protocol, the default mandatory routing protocol of IEEE 802.11s) *Infrastructure Wireless Mesh Protocol (IWMP) for Infrastructure Mesh Networks by GRECO UFPB-Brazil *OLSR (Optimized Link State Routing protocol) *OORP (OrderOne Routing Protocol) (OrderOne Networks Routing Protocol) *OSPF (Open Shortest Path First Routing) *Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (IETF ROLL RPL protocol, ) *PWRP (Predictive Wireless Routing Protocol) *TORA (Temporally- Ordered Routing Algorithm) *ZRP (Zone Routing Protocol) The IEEE has developed a set of standards under the title 802.11s. A less thorough list can be found at Ad hoc routing protocol list. Autoconfiguration protocols Standard autoconfiguration protocols, such as DHCP or IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration may be used over mesh networks.

K√ºbler-Ross was a 2007 inductee into the National Women's Hall of Fame, she was named by Time (magazine) as one of the \\"100 Most Important Thinkers\\" of the 20th Century and she was the recipient of nineteen honorary degrees. By July 1982, K√ºbler-Ross taught 125,000 students in death and dying courses in colleges, seminaries, medical schools, hospitals, and social-work institutions.\\"Turn on, tune in, drop dead\\" by Ron Rosenbaum, Harper's, July 1982, pages 32-42 In 1970, she delivered an Ingersoll Lecture at Harvard University on the theme On Death and Dying. Birth and education Elisabeth K√ºbler was born on July 8, 1926, in Z√ºrich, Switzerland, into a Protestant Christian Family. She was one of a set of triplets, two of which were identical. Her survival was jeopardized due to complications after birth.Newman, Laura. Elisabeth K√ºbler-Ross. (2004). British Medical Journal, 329 (7466), 627. Retrieved November 17, 2006. Her father wanted her to run his small business. She went to the University of Zurich to study medicine and graduated in 1957. During World War II she worked with refugees, in Z√ºrich, and following the war, did relief work in: France, Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. She would later visit Maidanek death camp which sparked her interest in the power of compassion and resilience of the human spirit. The horror stories of the survivors left permanent impressions on Elisabeth. She was profoundly affected by a visit to the Maidanek extermination camp in Poland and the images of hundreds of butterflies carved into some of the walls there. To K√ºbler-Ross, the butterflies‚Äîthese final works of art by those facing death‚Äîstayed with her for years and influenced her thinking about the end of life. Personal life In 1958, she married a fellow medical student from America, Emanuel (\\"Manny\\") Ross, and moved to the United States. Becoming pregnant disqualified her from a residency in pediatrics, so she took one in psychiatry. After suffering several miscarriages, she had a son, Kenneth, and a daughter, Barbara, in the early 1960s.K√ºbler-Ross, Elisabeth Her husband requested a divorce in 1979. Academic career K√ºbler-Ross moved to New York in 1958 to work and continued her studies. She began her psychiatric residency in the Manhattan State Hospital in the early 1960s, she began her career working to create treatment for those who were schizophrenic along with those faced with the title \\"hopeless patient\\". These treatment programs would work to restore the patient's sense of dignity and self-respect. Elisabeth also intended to reduce the medications that kept these patients overly sedated, and found ways to help them relate to the outside world During her time at the hospital, she realized how appalling the treatments of the imminently dying patients were. This realization made her strive to make a difference in the lives of these individuals. In 1962, she accepted a position at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. There, Elisabeth was a junior faculty member and gave her first interview of a young terminally ill woman in front of a roomful of medical students. Her intentions were not to be an example of pathology, but K√ºbler-Ross wanted to depict a human being who desired to be understood as she was coping with her illness and how it has impacted her life. She states to her students, > \\"Now you are reacting like human beings instead of scientists. Maybe now > you'll not only know how a dying patient feels but you will also be able to > treat them with compassion the same compassion that you would want for > yourself\\" K√ºbler-Ross completed her training in psychiatry in 1963, and then moved to Chicago in 1965. She sometimes questioned the practices of traditional psychiatry that she observed. She also undertook 39 months of classical psychoanalysis training in Chicago. She became an instructor at the University of Chicago's Pritzker School of Medicine where she began to conduct a regular weekly educational seminar that consisted of live interviews with terminally ill patients. She had her students participate in these despite a large amount of resistance from the medical staff.. A Life magazine ran an article on K√ºbler-Ross in November 1969, bringing public awareness to her work outside of the medical community. The response was enormous and influenced K√ºbler-Ross‚Äôs decision to focus on her career on working with the terminally ill and their families. The intense scrutiny her work received also had an impact on her career path. K√ºbler-Ross stopped teaching at the university to work privately on what she called the ‚Äúgreatest mystery in science‚Äù‚Äîdeath. Healing Center K√ºbler-Ross was one of the central figures in the hospice care movement, believing that euthanasia prevents people from completing their 'unfinished business'. In 1977 she persuaded her husband to buy forty acres of land in Escondido, California, near San Diego, where she founded \\"Shanti Nilaya\\" (Home of Peace). She intended it as a healing center for the dying and their families. She was also a co-founder of the American Holistic Medical Association. In the late 1970s, she became interested in out-of-body experiences, mediumship, spiritualism, and other ways of attempting to contact the dead. This led to a scandal connected to the Shanti Nilaya Healing Center, in which she was duped by Jay Barham, founder of the Church of the Facet of the Divinity. Claiming he could channel the spirits of the departed and summon ethereal \\"entities\\", he encouraged church members to engage in sexual relations with the \\"spirits\\". He may have hired several women to play the parts of female spirits for this purpose.Sex, Visitors from the Grave, Psychic Healing: Kubler-Ross Is a Public Storm Center Again by Karen G. Jackovich. In People, October 29, 1979, page found 2011-03-05. Kubler-Ross' friend Deanna Edwards attended a service to ascertain whether allegations against Barham were true. He was found to be naked and wearing only a turban when Edwards unexpectedly pulled masking tape off the light switch and flipped on the light.Playboy Interview with Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's' Playboy Magazine, May, 1981TIME.com, The Conversion of Kubler-Ross, TIME, November 12, 1979Elisabeth Kubler-Ross in the Afterworld of Entities by Kate Coleman, New West, 30 July 1979 K√ºbler-Ross announced the ending of her association with both Marty and Jay Barham in her ‚ÄúShanti Nilaya Newsletter‚Äù (issue 7) on June 7, 1981. Investigations on near death experiences K√ºbler-Ross also dealt with the phenomenon of near-death experiences. Her reputation began to decline when she began researching the controversial subject of near-death experiences. Elisabeth was also an advocate for spiritual guides and afterlife, serving on the Advisory Board of the International Association for Near-Death Studies (IANDS) Elisabeth reported her interviews with the dying for the first time in her book, On Death and Dying: What the dying have to teach doctors, nurses, clergy, and their own families (1969)Video: Elisabeth K√ºbler-Ross √ºber Nahtoderfahrungen (1981) , abgerufen am 14.

Elisabeth went on to write more about near death experiences (NDEs) in her books, \\"On Life After Death\\" 1991, and \\"The Tunnel and The Light\\" 1999. AIDS work One of her greatest wishes was her plan to build a hospice for abandoned infants and children infected with HIV to give them a lasting home where they could live until their death. Elisabeth attempted to do this in 1985 in Virginia, but local residents feared the possibility of infection and blocked the necessary re-zoning. In 1994, she lost her house and possessions to an arson fire that is suspected to have been set by opponents of her AIDS work.Kinofenster.de She conducted many workshops on life, death, grief, and AIDS in different parts of the world. In 1990, she moved the Healing Center to her own farm in Head Waters, Virginia, to reduce her extensive traveling. Death K√ºbler-Ross suffered a series of strokes in 1995 which left her partially paralyzed on her left side; in the meantime \\"The Healing Waters Farm\\" and the Elisabeth K√ºbler-Ross Center closed. She found herself living in a wheelchair, slowly waiting for death to come, and wished to be able to determine her time of death.Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, On life After Death, Foreword by Caroline Myss p.vii. Celestial Arts. . In 1997 Oprah flew to Arizona to interview her and discuss with Elisabeth if she herself was going through the Five Stages of Grief. Further, in a 2002 interview with The Arizona Republic, she stated that she was ready for death and even welcomed it, calling God a \\"damned procrastinator.\\" Elisabeth died in 2004 at a nursing home in Scottsdale, Arizona, in the presence of her son, daughter, and two family friends. She was buried at the Paradise Memorial Gardens Cemetery in Scottsdale, Arizona. In 2005 her son, Ken Ross founded the Elisabeth K√ºbler- Ross Foundation in Scottsdale, Arizona.  Contributions  Elisabeth K√ºbler- Ross was the first individual to transfigure the way that the world looks at the terminally ill, she pioneered hospice-care and near-death research, and was the first to bring terminally ill individuals' lives to the public eye. Elisabeth was the driving force behind the movement for doctors and nurses alike to ‚Äútreat the dying with dignity‚Äù. Her extensive work with the dying led to the internationally best-selling book On Death and Dying in 1969, she proposed the, now famous, Five Stages of Grief‚Ñ¢ as a pattern of adjustment: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. In general, individuals experience most of these stages when faced with their imminent death. The Five Stages of Grief have since been adopted by bereavement as applying to the survivors of a loved one's death as well alike. After 2000 an increasing number of companies began using the Five Stages to explain reactions to change and loss. This is now known as the K√ºbler-Ross Change Curve‚Ñ¢ and is used by a large variety of Fortune 500 Companies in the US and internationally. In 2018 Stanford University acquired the K√ºbler-Ross archives from her family and intends to build a digital library of her papers, interviews and other archival material. The American Journal of Bioethics devoted its entire December 2019 issue to the 50th anniversary of, \\"On Death and Dying.\\" The Elisabeth Kubler-Ross Foundation continues her work through a series of international chapters around the world. Elisabeth wrote over 20 books on death and dying. At the end of her life she was mentally active, co-authoring two books with David Kessler including \\"On Grief and Grieving\\".

He is from the planet Colu and is a long-standing member of the Legion of Super-Heroes. The first live-action version of the character appeared as a regular character in the fifth season and a recurring character in the seventh season of Smallville, played by James Marsters. Brainiac 5 is introduced in the third season of Supergirl, portrayed by Jesse Rath. He became part of the main cast in the fourth season. A female version of Brainiac 5 from an alternate universe appeared in the fifth season of Supergirl, portrayed by Rath's sister Meaghan Rath. Publication history Brainiac 5 first appeared in name in Action Comics #276 (May 1961) and was created by Jerry Siegel and Jim Mooney. He was originally written as a descendant of Superman's enemy Brainiac. Several years later, when Brainiac was revealed to be a living computer, the story was retconned, and Brainiac 5 became a descendant of the villain's adopted son. Fictional character biography Original continuity (1958‚Äì1994) Brainiac 5 is a green- skinned, blond-haired teenage native of the planet Colu, who claimed to be descended from the original Brainiac, one of Superman's deadliest enemies. He wished to join the Legion as atonement for his great-great-grandfather's misdeeds. When Brainiac 1 was revealed to be an android created by the Computer Tyrants, Brainiac 5 \\"discovered\\" he was actually descended from Brainiac 2, the leader of the rebellion against the tyrants, as well as being the clone of the original Brainiac. Brainiac 5's ingenuity led to the invention of, amongst other things, the Legion flight ring (perfecting an invention of the original Invisible Kid based on a metal discovered by Mon- El), the anti-lead serum that allowed Mon-El to leave the Phantom Zone and the force field belt which became the signature device of the character. Another of Brainiac 5's creations had less beneficial effects: the super computer Computo, which attempted to take over the world, killing one of Triplicate Girl's three selves in the process. He successfully destroyed his creation with \\"an anti-matter force\\". Another experiment, performed in conjunction with honorary Legionnaire Rond Vidar, led to the transformation of fellow scientist Professor Jaxon Rugarth into the psychotic, all-powerful Infinite Man. As time went on, Brainiac 5 began to be portrayed as unstable. Long attracted to Supergirl, Brainiac 5 created a robot duplicate of her in his sleep, convincing himself this was the real Supergirl.Superboy vol. 1, #204 (September‚ÄìOctober 1974) A few years the Legion encountered Pulsar Stargrave, a villain who convinced Brainiac 5 that he was the Coluan's long-lost father.Superboy vol. 1, #224 (February 1977) Brainiac 5 joined Stargrave to battle the sorcerer Mordru, but the android's influence would haunt him long after that. It was claimed in Superboy #225 that Stargrave was actually the original Brainiac android, but the truth of this is uncertain. When Stargrave murders Ultra Boy's ex-girlfriend An Ryd, Brainiac 5 frames Ultra Boy for the murder. Chameleon Boy, who suspected Brainiac 5 from the beginning, finds proof when Brainiac's madness leads him to an attempt to destroy the universe using the Miracle Machine, a device that turns thoughts into reality. He is stopped by Matter-Eater Lad, who eats the machine, and both are committed to a mental institution (the energies of the Machine having driven Matter-Eater Lad insane). Brainiac 5 eventually recovers his sanity and rejoins the group. Shortly afterward, however, he is accused of having murdered Ultra Boy's ex- girlfriend himself. To prove his innocence, he finds Stargrave and defeats him. He later manages to cure Matter-Eater Lad's insanity. Around this time, he corrects another of his mistakes by finding a way of controlling Computo. =Crisis on Infinite Earths= Brainiac 5 enters a state of deep melancholy upon the thousand-year anniversary of Supergirl's death at the hands of the Anti-Monitor during Crisis on Infinite Earths.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 3) #16 (November 1985) However, as the Crisis eliminated Supergirl from existence, Brainiac 5 (as well as everyone else) has no recollection of her. Beyond this, however, Brainiac 5's history was relatively unaffected by the Crisis, although it would be some time before he received an origin that reflected the new Brainiac 1. Following the death of the pocket universe Superboy, Brainiac 5 is one of a number of Legionnaires who swear revenge on the Time Trapper. To this end, he recreated the Infinite Man. The Infinite Man and Time Trapper seemingly destroy each other, but Brainiac 5 quits the Legion after being accused of murdering Professor Rugarth. He rejoins in Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 3) #63 (Aug 1989), shortly before the \\"Five Year Gap\\". =\\"Five Year Gap\\"= Five years after the end of the \\"Magic Wars\\", things had radically changed for the heroes, most notably the disbanding of the Legion and an ongoing war with the Khund Empire, which had resulted in Earth's government (Earthgov) signing a deal with the Dominators. When Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 4) began, Brainiac 5 was dedicated to finding a cure to the Validus Plague, a virulent disease that had afflicted an entire planet and crippled the former Lightning Lad, Garth Ranzz. Soon after the start of Legion (vol. 4) a retcon removed the Superman family of characters almost completely from Legion continuity. Supergirl was replaced by Laurel Gand, a Daxamite descendant of Lar Gand's brother. Unlike Supergirl, she was a native of the 30th century. Brainiac 5 and Laurel did have a relationship, but the couple eventually separated and she became the common law wife of Rond Vidar (a Legion ally and Green Lantern who had been a close friend of Brainiac 5). Brainiac 5 joined other Legionnaires in searching for the space pirate Roxxas, and was present when the team officially reformed. The reassembled Legion repelled a Khund invasion fleet, and confronted Darkseid, but shortly thereafter, was swept into the war against the corrupt Earthgov and the Dominators. During the Dominators' subjugation of Earth, the members of their highly classified \\"Batch SW6\\" escaped captivity. Originally, Batch SW6 appeared to be a group of teenage Legionnaire clones, created from samples apparently taken just prior to Ferro Lad's death at the hands of the Sun- Eater. Later, they were revealed to be time-paradox duplicates, every bit as legitimate as their older counterparts. After Earth was destroyed in a disaster reminiscent of the destruction of Krypton over a millennium earlier,Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 4) #38 (Late December 1992) a few dozen surviving cities and their inhabitants reconstituted their world as New Earth. The SW6 Legionnaires ‚Äî including their version of Brainiac 5 ‚Äî remained. Not long after the destruction of Earth, Brainiac 5 discovered the timestream was extremely unstable, and that Legion history was in a state of constant flux. This was the first indication of Zero Hour, the event that would lead to the Legion's whole history being rebooted. During a battle with Glorith, a time- warping sorceress, Brainiac 5 was rapidly aged into a weathered, enfeebled older man. Due to the trauma of this rapid aging, Brainiac's already-prickly personality took a turn for the worse, and he became colder, more clinical, and even amoral. When the Legion was forced to go on the run as fugitives after being framed by Universo and the Khund Empire, Brainiac wore a high-tech combat suit to protect his ravaged new body, and went by the simpler moniker of \\"5\\". When \\"Zero Hour\\" befell the Legion, Brainiac 5 redoubled his efforts to save the timestream and reality as the 30th century knew it. Despite all the brilliance of Brainiac and his youthful SW6 counterpart combined, they could not save themselves from being swallowed up by temporal entropy, and their timeline was rebooted. Zero Hour reboot continuity (1994‚Äì2004) Following the Zero Hour event and the rebooting of the Legion, the \\"new\\" Brainiac 5 was extremely antisocial and disrespectful of his colleagues. He barely interacted with the other Legionnaires, although he was still somewhat attracted to Laurel Gand, now called Andromeda, who was now also something of an outsider. When Andromeda was believed killed, he was the only person who really missed her, a wrenching experience for someone used to suppressing emotion.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 4) #72 (September 1995) It was later revealed that, even amongst Coluans, Querl Dox had been something of a loner, due to his even higher intelligence, interest in practical experiments rather than \\"pure\\" thought, and lack of concern about the consequences of his experiments. It was also revealed that his mother, Brainiac 4, had abandoned him at birth, having no emotional attachment whatsoever to her newborn child.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 4) #77 (February 1996) As a child, he was cared for by robots and given almost no contact with other living people, developing no social skills. Having created a method of traveling back to the 20th century, leading to the Legion's rescue of Valor, Brainiac 5 was arrested for unauthorized time-travel. He was later pardoned when R.J. Brande became President of the United Planets. In addition to having a crush on Andromeda, Brainiac 5 had a secret stash of lustful holo-collection featuring Andromeda herself, Dreamer (Nura Nal), Spark (Ayla Ranzz) and another fellow legionary whose alias begins with \\"In-\\" (obviously Invisible Kid (Lyle Norg)), and probably others.Legion (vol. 1) #31 (May 2004) Before that, in a moment of rare emotional outburst, Brainy kisses Lyle's cheek as he finds him again, and right after he feels embarrassed.Legion (vol. 1) #27 (January 2004) =Trapped in the 20th century= Brainiac 5 was one of a number of Legionnaires who were trapped in the 20th century. He spent his efforts then trying to find a way back to his own time using 20th century equipment. He finally produced a computer capable of doing this, utilizing a 30th Century Omnicom, a New Gods Mother Box loaned to him by Metron and the responsometer of Veridium of the Metal Men. Unfortunately, this became the post-Zero Hour C.O.M.P.U.T.O. The Legion had to defeat it and separate it into its component pieces before returning to their own time. While in the 20th century, he also encountered his ancestors, Brainiac and Vril Dox II, as well as the post- Crisis Supergirl. Ironically, he was attracted to Supergirl due to her similarity to Andromeda (some stories suggested that Brainiac 5's attraction for tall blonde women was linked to his desire to find his mother, a tall blonde who had abandoned him at birth).Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 4 #108 (Sept. 1989) =Upgrade: Brainiac 5.1= Upon his return, he was part of a team that investigated a mysterious space anomaly. The anomaly \\"upgraded\\" him: he was now more considerate of others, and had vastly improved people skills. He also internalized his force shield apparatus. Following his return from the space anomaly, a friendship was formed with his teammate Gates, who dubbed the improved Querl Dox \\"Brainiac 5.1\\", a name he adopted.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 4) #104 (May 1998) Shortly after that, the Legion investigated the criminal/terrorist organization called the Dark Circle. Querl learned his mother, Brainiac 4, was the leader of the Dark Circle, having found that mass destruction was the only thing capable of making her feel emotions.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 4) #108 (September 1998) The shock of this almost caused him to revert to his former, distant self. Although he did not revert, he began to be somewhat sarcastic and impatient again. He also began researching without considering the consequences again, inadvertently transforming the team into a \\"Bizarro Legion\\".Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 4) #114‚Äì115 =Legion Lost= Brainiac 5.1 was amongst the Legionnaires who were cast into a distant galaxy when the Stargate network was shut down. They spent a year travelling through the \\"Lost Galaxy\\". During this time, he felt a great amount of stress, as his teammates all believed he could devise a way of getting them home in addition to all the other responsibilities forced upon him by the circumstances of their situation. As he eventually confessed to Saturn Girl, he did not have a clue how to get them home - or even where \\"home\\" was, relative to their location. In the same conversation, he also complained that he'd \\"always hated [his] name upgrade,\\" and on the way out, as well as reassuring him, she made a point of redubbing him \\"Brainiac Five,\\" and he dropped the \\".1\\" from his name thereafter.Legion Lost #9 (January 2001) Eventually, using his teammate Shikari's tracking skills and an interdimensional doorway they'd earlier found, but been forced to leave, he did get them home. Upon their return, Brainiac began developing a replacement for the Stargates, based on the \\"threshold\\" doorway they had used to return from the Lost Galaxy. Restoring the connection to the planet Xanthu, they learned that it had been at war with Robotica, the \\"robot homeworld\\", until they mysteriously disappeared. Robotica's leader was revealed as C.O.M.P.U.T.O. A strike team was launched against it, but Brainiac 5 tricked it into upgrading itself, so it no longer sought vengeance.The Legion #14 (January 2002) It was revealed that the Coluans disapproved of artificial intelligence, however, and Brainiac 5 was made a pariah on his homeworld for saving machine-life from destruction.The Legion #15 (February 2004) DC One Million During the Reboot Legion's heyday, they are tangentially involved in the DC One Million crossover, where the audience is shown the \\"Justice Legion L\\" of the 853rd Century. Loosely based on members of the Legion of the 31st Century, the Justice Legion L are tasked with protecting the remains of the United Planets, by that point reduced to a small system of worlds joined together by a powerful magnetic core centered on Braal. Several of the planets involved had actually merged to form new, symbiotic worlds, including Colu- Bgztl. The Justice Legion L includes Brainiac 417, a counterpart to Brainiac 5 who is from this particular combined world. As with all members of his race, he combines super-intelligence with an ephemeral, intangible state; Brainiac 417 appears to be a shimmering green brain inside a transparent humanoid body. His race are purported to have become beings of pure intelligence and thought. Brainiac 417 is not the leader of the Justice Legion L (that duty fell to Cosmicbot), but is one of the most valuable members, and is shown to have integrated his technologies to the point where he can jump back a thousand years to recruit an earlier version of Superboy for the purposes of saving the day. \\"Threeboot\\" continuity (2004-2009) Cover to Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 5) #1 (2005). Art by Barry Kitson In volume 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes title, Brainiac 5 is portrayed as similar to his ancestor Vril Dox II in L.E.G.I.O.N.. He is just as arrogant and unthinking of others as the previous version was initially, but is more politically savvy. He has a tendency to put plans in motion without consulting Legion leader Cosmic Boy, who suspects him of planning a coup. He also has problems with Dream Girl as he hates that she is able to predict the future without scientific means. \\"Brainy\\" was also unnerved when she told him that they would one day marry. When she was killed during Terror Firma's attack on the Legion HQ on Earth, he became obsessed with \\"outthinking death.\\" In a botched experiment to restore her to life, he however manages to store her consciousness in his own subconscious mind, enabling the girl to interact with him in his dreams, and keep using her precognition in his behalf. Following Cosmic Boy's disappearance, Brainiac 5 has become the advisor to Legion leader Supergirl and later to Lightning Lad. Brainiac 5 eventually proposes to Dream Girl after spending the night together in which Dream Girl inhabited the body of a spiritualist, however, on the same night, Princess Projectra has her own urges and primal, repressed emotion, viciously attack Dream Girl upon her return to Querl's mind, viciously beating her and gouging out her eyes, leaving the girl blind and powerless, thus hoping to strip Brainiac 5 of her constant counseling.Legion of Super-Heroes #47 (December 2008) He much later manages to turn their dream into reality when, forced to rebuild new bodies for his teammates, mangled to shreds by a race of digitalized aliens while connected to the cyberspace, creates a new body for Dream Girl, imprinting her personality, into the cloned body. Successful in his attempt, that, despite Nura's previsions, even restored her lost sight, Brainiac 5 happily extends to all the legionnaires his invitation to their marriage, holding hands with his resurrected soon-to-be bride Legion of Super-Heroes #50 (March 2009) Unbeknownst to Brainiac 5, the dark side of his mind, the avatar of his repressed urges and dark feelings, was granted a physical body by Princess Projectra and sent to the physical body. Post- Infinite Crisis (2007) The events of the Infinite Crisis miniseries have apparently restored a close analogue of the Pre-Crisis Legion to continuity, as seen in \\"The Lightning Saga\\" story arc in Justice League of America and Justice Society of America, and in the \\"Superman and the Legion of Super- Heroes\\" story arc in Action Comics. This incarnation of the Legion shares roughly the same history as the original Legion up to the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths.IGN: Superman/Green Lantern interview =The Lightning Saga= The original Brainiac 5 from the Pre-Crisis universe briefly appeared in the Justice League/Justice Society Lightning Saga crossover. He was revealed as the mastermind behind the Legion's plot to return to the 21st century to retrieve someone connected to the Flash. At the end of the storyline, Brainiac 5 was seen holding one of the lightning rods the Legionnaires used on 21st century Earth, and told his teammates that the Legion had gotten what it came for. This Brainiac 5's agenda does not end there, however; in the pages of Countdown, Una arrived in the present to stop Karate Kid from returning to the 31st century, explaining that Brainiac 5 says the two of them have another mission in the present day. =Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes= In this follow-up story to the Lightning Saga (taking place in Action Comics #858-863), Brainiac 5 is masquerading as a tyrannical dictator of Colu, but only to delay Colu, which is the strategical beachhead of a United Planets attack on Earth, and keep them from completing their calculations. Brainiac still possesses the Lightning Rod, and states that the person inside is crucial to stopping the \\"Crisis of the 31st century\\". However, his ruse is discovered, and Brainiac leaves with the Legion, with only four hours until the United Planets go to war.Action Comics #862 (March 2008) After Superman and the Legion defeat Earthman and his \\"Justice League of Earth\\", and convince the armada to stand down, Brainiac 5 tells Superman that the Legion will not forget him this time. =Final Crisis: Legion of Three Worlds= In this Final Crisis tie-in, Brainiac 5 is driven to the breaking point after being banished by Colu, and by Earth's continued xenophobia. He considers leaving the Legion, but is convinced to remain as a way to prove all his naysayers wrong. When Superboy-Prime attacks Takron-Galtos and frees the Legion of Super-Villains, Brainiac 5 informs his fellow Legionnaires of his plan to recruit their Post-Zero Hour and \\"Threeboot\\" selves to help.Final Crisis: Legion of Three Worlds #1 (August 2008) His plan succeeds, and Brainiac meets his alternate selves from two other realities. The \\"Threeboot\\" version of Brainiac refuses to work with his older self, due to his rebellious nature, while the Post-Zero Hour version sees his older counterpart as wiser and more experienced, and tries to mediate between his alternate selves.Final Crisis: Legion of Three Worlds #2 (October 2008) Despite their differences, all three versions of Brainiac 5 work together to set in motion the final phases of the original Brainiac's master contingency plan against Superboy-Prime. This plan, which involved the resurrections of Superboy-Prime foes Bart Allen/Kid Flash (whose essence was in the lightning rod) and Conner Kent/Superboy, was devised long ago when Brainiac 5 was forewarned of Prime's arrival by one of Dream Girl's prophesies. The New 52 Brainiac 5 seems to be largely unaffected by the changes of the Flashpoint miniseries, as is true for the Legion of Super- Heroes as a whole. However, the term \\"Brainiac\\" is no longer his name but an honorable title.Legion: Secret Origin #2 (November 2008) This adds understanding to the opening arcs of Action Comics vol. 2 (2011) by Grant Morrison, where an alien is stealing and bottling cities, an act usually committed by Brainiac, but is here only named \\"the Collector\\". DC Rebirth A younger Brainiac 5 appears briefly during Justice League vol. 3 (2017) by Bryan Hitch, though unconnected to the Legion. He is also not referred to by his name, only as the \\"brainy kid\\" by Cyborg. After analyzing the Timeless technology with specialized contacts, he lends Cyborg his prototype flight bracelet, marked with the Brainiac sigil, so the League member can reach the weapon. In the \\"Watchmen\\" sequel \\"Doomsday Clock,\\" Brainiac 5 is among the Legion of Super-Heroes members that appear in the present after Doctor Manhattan undid the experiment that erased the Legion of Super-Heroes and the Justice Society of America.Doomsday Clock #12 (December 2019). DC Comics. Powers and abilities Brainiac 5 possesses a twelfth level intellect which grants him superhuman calculation skills, amazing memory and exceptional technical knowledge. By comparison, 20th century Earth as a whole constitutes a sixth level intellect, and most of his fellow Coluans have an eighth level intellect. 31st century Earth as a whole is a ninth level intellect. His incredible memory allows him to retain knowledge of events that all other characters forget such as the first meeting of the three different Legions.Legion of Three Worlds #3 (April 2009) The Post-Zero Hour version of Brainiac 5 was shown in several issues to be able to ponder twelve lines of thought simultaneously.Legion of Super-Heroes #107 (Aug. 1998) When a renegade Titanian read his mind, she discovered that his subconscious ‚Äî usually the more active and chaotic part of the mind ‚Äî was less active than his twelve simultaneous conscious thoughts. Whether any other version of Brainiac also exhibits this trait remains to be seen. Equipment Since Brainiac 5 processes a super intelligent mind, his main method of aiding himself and his fellow Legionnaires has always been through devices he himself invented. His primary role in any version of the Legion has always been that of the scientist. One of his most important inventions is the Legion Flight Ring, which he has either invented or had a significant role in creating over the various versions of the Legion.Legion of Super-Heroes #267 (Sept. 1980) Another invention, which has proved invaluable to him, is the force field belt which has remained his main method of self-defense in cases where he found himself in battle in every version of the Legion. In recent issues of The Legion of Super Heroes, Brainiac 5's force field belt, one of his signature inventions, has now been relegated to one of the predecessors of the title, with Brainiac 5 calling the invention an irreplaceable piece of his family history. In various storylines, another invention of his has been the super- computer C.O.M.P.U.T.O. This machine has been included in most versions of the Legion, but always reworked in the storyline to suit the situation required. Brainiac 5 modified the \\"Time Sphere\\" to create the \\"Time Bubble\\" he used it to time travel to send or bring other DC characters to and from the 31st century. Other methods of travel that have not involved time travel have included devices such as the developments on the Threshold technology and the wormhole-conduit teleporter. Not all of Brainiac 5's inventions have proved useful to the Legion. Both versions of C.O.M.P.U.T.O. each proved to be among Brainiac 5's worst mistakes. While not a product of his own research but rather stolen data, Brainiac 5.1 also managed to create Bizarro versions of many of the Legion members. In other media Television * Brainiac 5 made a non-voiced cameo appearance in Superman: The Animated Series. In the episode \\"New Kids In Town\\", he chats with teammate Triplicate Girl. At the time of his debut it was unclear if he, in fact, used his given name or had any connections to Brainiac. However, his costume included a chest symbol comprising three circles forming an inverted triangle. This closely resembled the discs on the animated Brainiac's forehead (and his icon when he was a computer program), suggesting some kind of connection between them. It was revealed on commentary on the Superman: The Animated Series Vol. 3 DVD box set that this character was in fact Brainiac 5. * Brainiac 5 appears in Justice League Unlimited, voiced by Matt Czuchry. Like his comic book counterpart, Brainiac 5 wears his trademark force field belt, which protects him from the Fatal Five's attack. It is revealed that Brainiac learned to pass its code biologically and created Brainiac 5 as an organic being. Unfortunately for Brainiac, Brainiac 5 rejected evil and joined the Legion of Super Heroes. In the episode \\"Far From Home,\\" he brings Green Arrow, Supergirl, and Green Lantern into the future to help him battle the Fatal Five. In the short time after meeting each other, Brainiac 5 and Supergirl fall in love. After the Fatal Five are defeated, Supergirl chooses to remain in the future with him and the Legion. * Brainiac 5 appears in Legion of Super Heroes, voiced by Adam Wylie. He is a core member of the Legion of Super Heroes. This version is Coluan, a nano-based cybernetic organism that not only possesses 12th-level intelligence, but can assume a human-like form. His human-like form can also alter its shape to create tools and weapons or transform into a large, battle robot form, much like the reboot Legion member, Gear. His AI core is based on the original Brainiac 1.0 from whom he tries to distance himself as best as possible. Unlike many versions where he is portrayed as cold and unfeeling, this version is considerably more emotional. In the first season, he often appears eager to prove himself to his older teammates, particularly the original Superman; Brainiac 5, unlike his villainous ancestor, idolizes Superman. However, his high intellect and his emotional nature often cause him internal conflict; for example, he idolizes Superman, but knows intellectually that he cannot reveal many of the things he knows lie in the future for Superman once he is returned to his own time, as Superman's knowledge of his future events could change what is, for the Legion, history. In the second- season episodes \\"Chained Lightning\\" and \\"Message in a Bottle,\\" Brainiac 5 grows close to Shrinking Violet; however, as the series ended it remains unknown if this was an intended romance or not. He seems to have feelings for Superman himself, because of the simulation he produced that involved him and Superman shown at the premiere of season two and many other incidents in the series. In the second-season premiere, Superman X (a clone of Superman from the 41st century) hints that someday Brainiac 5 will be responsible for something terrible in the future. The starting phase occurs in \\"Message in a Bottle,\\" when Brainiac 5 was forced to tap into the data of Brainiac who had been observing Brainiac 5 since he came online. Brainiac 5 travels within himself to meet with his ancestor, where he is offered data from the original Brainiac. Brainiac 5 forcefully accepts the \\"gift\\" of data he needed to stop Imperiex from his ancestor who hinted it to \\"open new avenues of possibilities.\\" Soon after using the info he obtained to save Kandor and restore it to original size, Brainiac 5 begins to suffer data corruption as Imperiex intended from the start, becoming cold and unfeeling in the process. Once completely under his ancestor's influence during the \\"Dark Victory\\" series finale, Brainiac 5 assumes a new form in homage to his ancestor and leaves the Legion to join Imperiex's army, taking command after killing Imperiex. Once overpowering the hivemind on his homeworld of Colu with his will, Brainiac 5 intends to bring \\"order\\" to the universe, destroying any who interfere. Thanks to Superman and Superman X, Brainiac 5 managed to regain control over himself and overpower his ancestor. In the process, Brainiac 5 becomes a pure organic being as he discards his robotic armor. To cope with this new state and his recent actions, Brainiac 5 leaves the Legion. The robotic parts, in turn, combine to form a new evil Brainiac, leaving the series with a cliffhanger, which was intended to finish until the show was canceled. * Brainiac 5 appears in the Smallville live-action series. In the season eight episode \\"Legion,\\" Clark Kent and three Legionnaires (Lightning Lad, Saturn Girl, and Cosmic Boy) extract Brainiac from Chloe Sullivan's body, leaving his nanobots a condensed ball of metal, attempting to repurpose any programming they can use from the core to be friendlier. Brainiac 5 appears in the season ten episode \\"Homecoming,\\" visiting Clark to show the past, present and future and help Clark come to terms with the darkness in his own heart in preparation for an upcoming confrontation with Darkseid. Actor James Marsters, who portrayed Brainiac in Smallville, returned to play Brainiac 5. Brainiac 5's character has been described by producers as \\"a slippery fish with a questionable moral compass\\" despite the reprogramming. * Brainiac 5 appears in the TV shows set in the Arrowverse portrayed by Jesse Rath. ** Brainiac 5 appears in the third season of Supergirl. He appears as a member of the Legion of Superheroes. Brainiac is first mentioned only as Querl in the seventh episode, \\"Wake Up,\\" by Mon-El. However, in his subsequent appearances, he is referred to as \\"Brainy\\" by his fellow Legionnaires, Mon-El and Imra Ardeen. In the season finale, his home time period has become uninhabitable and he stays in the 21st century. Rath was promoted to series regular for season four. In season 4, Brainy assists Supergirl, Martian Manhunter, and the D.E.O. in their fight against the Children of Liberty led by Agent Liberty as well as Lex Luthor's plot to discredit Supergirl. In addition, he also acts as a mentor to Nia Nal, an ancestor of Dream Girl's, when teaching her how to master her abilities; a romantic relationship between them eventually develops. J'onn, Brainy, and Nia later try to infiltrate a government base to save the apprehended aliens there. While J'onn and Nia are captured, the agents electrocute Brainy, inadvertently rebooting him and causing him to be exactly like his ancestors. He escapes and betrays J'onn and Nia, getting them deported with all the other aliens there. After seeing Nia Nal in mortal danger, Brainy's emotions returned and he went back to normal. During the fifth season, he continues to explore his relationship with Dreamer, but following the Crisis, an encounter with some of his surviving doppelgangers from other Earths prompts Brainy to disable some of his personality inhibitors to maximise his intellectual capabilities to oppose the plans of the organisation Leviathan, which leads him to ally himself with Lex Luthor to properly oppose Leviathan, operating on a principle of pure logic that causes him to ignore the issues of working with a known villain. ** Brainiac 5 appears in the Arrowverse crossover Elseworlds. He appears to assist Superman fight John Deegan in the form of a black suit-wearing Superman. When Deegan summons an A.M.A.Z.O., Brainiac 5 fights the A.M.A.Z.O. and defeats it. ** Rath's older sister Meaghan guest starred as a female Brainiac 5 in Season 5 of Supergirl. She made her first appearance in the January 19, 2020 episode, \\"The Bottle Episode,\\" in which she was described as a version of Brainiac 5 from an alternate Earth. The episode also featured several other versions of Brainiac 5 resembling Rath's character, also from alternate Earths. Film * Brainiac 5 appears in the 2019 DC Universe Original Movie Justice League vs. the Fatal Five, voiced by Noel Fisher. Video games * Brainiac 5 is mentioned in Injustice: Gods Among Us in Ares's ending where Superman's defeat has the opposite effect for Ares and is further weakened by the ensuing peace to which Ares imprisons Brainiac 5 and forces him to create a time loop of the game's events creating a never ending cycle of conflict which Ares can feed off of forever. * Brainiac 5 makes a cameo appearance in Injustice 2, voiced by Liam O'Brien. If Brainiac is used in the game's arcade mode in which Brainiac is the end boss, it is revealed at the end that the player character was actually Brainiac 5 who went back in time to fix the fear people had of the Coluan race in the future by defeating Brainiac and impersonating his ancestor. He returns to the 31st century where the Legion of Super Heroes confront him over his actions, but they are still proud to be on their side.

Similar to UK hardcore, it includes elements of bouncy techno and hardtrance. The tempo ranges from 150 to 180 BPM. History Early 1990s: origins Dance music in Spain became prominent in 1988 with the rise of acid house. M√°kina followed this trend and has its origins in the early 1990s in Valencia, Spain. Derived from another style called Bakalao, which was in reality the local name given to an association of electronic dance music played together with pop and rock tunes in Valencian clubs in the second half of the 1980s. Mid-1990s: breakthrough and success The genre gained prominence in 1991 when Spanish producer Chimo Bayo released his single, \\"Asi Me Gusta A Mi (X-Ta Si, X-Ta No)\\". The song was a success throughout Europe and the genre soon gained prominence. The genre became extremely popular throughout Spain from 1995 to 1997, as many M√°kina oriented singles reached number one on the Spanish Singles Chart. Spanish m√°kina group EX-3 had two number-one singles, \\"Extres\\" and \\"Ex-P-Cial\\" in 1995 and 1996, respectively. Perhaps the most recognized m√°kina single in the United States is \\"Streamline\\" by Newton, which was popularized by a 2006 Pepsi commercial starring Jimmy Fallon. From approximately 1999 to 2006 the genre was the staple of the rave scene in North East England and Scotland. Following the closures of the most prominent venues ‚Äì in particular the New Monkey nightclub ‚Äì its popularity faded in those areas and was largely replaced with UK Bounce (also known as \\"Donk\\" or \\"Scouse House\\").

She is a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes. There have been three versions of Ayla since her original debut; these versions are separated by the events of both the Zero Hour and Infinite Crisis limited series. Fictional character biography Silver Age First appearance of Lightning Lass from Adventure Comics #308. Art by John Forte. Ayla Ranzz (of the planet Winath, where twinning is normal) first appeared in Adventure Comics #308, (May 1963). She is the twin sister of fellow Legionnaire Garth (Lightning Lad) and the younger sister of the villainous Mekt (Lightning Lord). All three gained their lightning powers after being attacked by creatures called lightning beasts on the \\"lightning world\\" of Korbal. She originally joined the Legion disguised as her brother Lightning Lad, claiming to be her brother back from the dead, after Lightning Lad's apparent death at the hands of Zaryan. Her being an imposter was soon discovered, but she was admitted into the Legion as Lightning Lass. For many years she was called Light Lass, after Dream Girl used the science of her homeworld Naltor to change Ayla's lightning powers with the ability to make objects super- lightweight, or anti-gravity powers (The Light Lass powers were explained both ways over the years). Years later, Ayla left the Legion for a time, disillusioned with her Legion career and having ended a lengthy romance with fellow Legionnaire Timber Wolf. She broke up with him following a misunderstanding when she saw Timber Wolf embracing her sister-in-law Saturn Girl when both were stranded on a frozen asteroid. Eventually returning to Winath, Ayla was kidnapped by her brother Lightning Lord and a faction of the Legion of Super-Villains. When Ayla refused to join them, her brother tried to kill her by sending millions of volts of electricity through her body. However, Ayla survived and discovered that her original lightning powers had been restored. After the LSV was defeated, she rejoined the Legion as Lightning Lass. During the \\"Five Year Later\\" storyline it was revealed that Ayla had entered into a long-term same-sex relationship with Shrinking Violet. During the \\"Five Year Gap\\" following the Magic Wars, Earth fell under the covert control of the Dominators, and withdrew from the United Planets. A few years later, the members of the Dominators' highly classified \\"Batch SW6\\" escaped captivity. Originally, Batch SW6 appeared to be a group of teenage Legionnaire clones, created from samples apparently taken just prior to Ferro Lad's death at the hands of the Sun-Eater. Later, they were revealed to be time-paradox duplicates, every bit as legitimate as their older counterparts. After Earth was destroyed in a disaster reminiscent of the destruction of Krypton over a millennium earlier, a few dozen surviving cities and their inhabitants reconstituted their world as New Earth. The SW6 Legionnaires remained, and their version of Ayla Ranzz (possessing the Light Lass powers) assumed the code name Gossamer. Post-Zero Hour (Spark) Spark's introduction as Live Wire's replacement, much to his shock. Art by Jeff Moy. Ayla, known as Spark, originally joined the Legion as a replacement for her twin brother Live Wire, as their planet Winath decided to choose her rather than Garth, who had been classified as a runaway. Eventually, the \\"one member per planet\\" restriction was lifted, and he rejoined. She was one of the Legion members stranded in the 21st Century for a time as a result of the Emerald Eye's machinations. Her team helped the modern superheroes during the Final Night crisis, where Earth's sun was slowly being devoured. Spark personally provides the electricity to Guy Gardner's Warriors facility when the power went out while it was being used as a hospital. Some time after the sun was restored, she travels into the Source, which replaces her electrical powers with anti-gravity powers (although she did not change her codename). Upon returning to her native 31st Century and reuniting with her brother, however, she began to experience debilitating headaches when using her powers; the headaches were diagnosed as psychosomatic. Apparently, she could not handle having different powers than her brother. In a desperate attempt to restore her old powers, she returned to Korbal, the planet where she and her brothers originally gained their powers after being shocked by a \\"Lightning Beast\\" (which, at the time, had left them in a coma for months). Her altered genetic structure left her unable to take another blast, however, and she was killed. Shortly afterward, her brother and some of their teammates, who had followed her, arrived. In grief, Garth let off a huge blast which temporarily revived her, and Doctor Gym'll theorized that a greater blast could properly revive her and restore her electrical powers. By channeling a huge amount of atmospheric electricity, Garth succeeded. Shortly afterward, she became romantically associated with fellow Legionnaire Chameleon, who had a longstanding crush on her. Later, the Legion was disbanded after the apparent death of several of her teammates (including her brother and Chameleon) and she returned to Winath. However, when these teammates returned, Garth was not among them, having apparently sacrificed himself so the rest could return home. After Chameleon broke this news to her, she apparently did not resume her relationship with him. She briefly took the name Live Wire after this, but shortly before his return, she was convinced by the second Kid Quantum that she'd be better honoring her brother by being herself. Threeboot (Light Lass) Following another reboot of Legion continuity, Ayla Ranzz is again called Light Lass, and has gravity nullifying powers. In Supergirl and the Legion of Super-Heroes #26, it is revealed that she, like her siblings, had previously gained lightning powers after the accident on Korbal before another unspecified accident gave her gravitational powers. Light Lass had a reputation as the Legion's \\"party girl\\", and had relationships with Ultra Boy, Timber Wolf, and Sun Boy, as well as a one-night stand with Karate Kid. Brainiac 5 commented that he finds it aggravating that the ability to negate one of the fundamental forces is in the hands of someone who treats things so flippantly. However, she has been shown to take some things seriously, most notably dealing with her brother Mekt. Ayla took a very serious, and active role in assisting her brother Garth when he became Legion Leader following Supergirl's return to her time. Ayla also assisted Brainiac 5 and Star Boy in stabilizing gravity after an intruder planet appeared in the Sol system.Legion of Super-Heroes 50 Vol. 5 (2009) Post-Infinite Crisis - Return of original Lightning Lass The events of the Infinite Crisis miniseries restored a close analogue of the Pre-Crisis Legion to continuity, as seen in \\"The Lightning Saga\\" story arc in Justice League of America and Justice Society of America, and in the \\"Superman and the Legion of Super- Heroes\\" story arc in Action Comics, Ayla Ranzz is included in the Legion, possessing her original powers as Lightning Lass. In the Lightning Saga, it was initially implied that she was presumed dead by Timber Wolf, who said \\"I'm coming, Ayla\\" as he was about to sacrifice his life. However, it was later revealed that the two have reconciled and are once again in a romantic relationship.Adventure Comics #2/505 She appears in the Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes arc, serving as the power source for the hidden Legion headquarters. Ayla is next seen in Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #1, where she used her abilities to hold open the entrance to the Phantom Zone so her fellow Legionnaires Shadow Lass and Phantom Girl can rescue Mon-El. Ayla destroyed the Zone machine before Kryptonian criminal Zod has a chance to escape. She and her counterparts were later used as part of an experiment by Brainiac 5 to restore Bart Allen, with Ayla and Spark providing XS with lightning charges, and Light Lass using her gravity powers to prevent XS from becoming a singularity. Light Lass is later needed to extract the Kryptonian Chrysalis buried deep within Superman's Fortress of Solitude, buried there a thousand years ago by Starman. Ayla was later seen in issue #6 of Paul Levitz's new Legion of Superheroes series, where she was shown preparing to go on a holiday vacation with Shrinking Violet.Legion of Superheroes (vol. 6) #6 It is subsequently revealed that the two are romantically involved.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 6) Annual #1 Following the cancellation of the Legion of Superheroes series (and the Legion's disbanding), Ayla is depicted back home on Winath, but it is unclear whether Shrinking Violet is living with her there. Powers and abilities *As Lightning Lass, Ayla has the superhuman ability to generate electricity, usually in the form of lightning bolts. *As Spark, Ayla has the ability to generate electricity, and direct bolts of it accurately (the exact mechanism in her power which prevents the bolts taking the path of least resistance to Earth is not understood) which she commonly refers to as \\"lightning\\". She briefly possessed the ability to reduce objects' density, but has shown no sign of this since the restoration of her electrical powers. *As Light Lass in the Threeboot continuity, Ayla has the power to cancel and control gravity. Equipment As a member of the Legion of Super- Heroes she is provided a Legion Flight Ring. It allows her to fly and protects her from the vacuum of space and other dangerous environments. Reception Ayla Ranzz was ranked 47th in Comics Buyer's Guide's \\"100 Sexiest Women in Comics\\" list. In other media * In Superman: The Animated Series, Lightning Lass made a cameo appearance in the episode \\"New Kids In Town\\". * In the Legion of Super-Heroes animated series, Ayla (voiced by Kari Wahlgren) makes a cameo in a flashback to the accident on Korbal when Lightning Beasts attacked the three Ranzz children in the episode \\"Chained Lightning\\". Instead of gaining super powers, her matter was dispersed but her consciousness remained. She is later discovered as an energy being in a space storm that Imperiex is siphoning to power a weapon. With help from Mekt and Garth, she is returned to her physical form, having not aged in nearly a decade since the Lightning Beast attack. As she is a small child, she is not likely to become a Legion member any time soon and no evidence suggests she has super powers. * In the Smallville episode \\"Legion\\", Garth asks for Clark's autograph then claims it's for his sister. * In the season 3 Supergirl episode, \\"Legion of Superheroes,\\" Ayla is mentioned as a friend of Mon-El and Imra Ardeen in the 31st century, where she discovers that her home planet of Winath has been decimated by creatures known as the Blight. She is shown in Season 5 to have been married to Winn Schott Jr, with whom she has a daughter named Mary. * In Justice League vs. the Fatal Five, she does not appear in person, but instead in a photo with Star Boy, hinting that they are in a romantic relationship.

The work was written between 1821 and 1822. Like other late period sonatas, it contains fugal elements. It was dedicated to his friend, pupil, and patron, Archduke Rudolf. The sonata consists of only two contrasting movements. The second movement is marked as an arietta with variations. Thomas Mann called it \\"farewell to the sonata form\\". The work entered the repertoire of leading pianists only in the second half of the 19th century. Rhythmically visionary and technically demanding, it is one of the most discussed of Beethoven's works. History F.G. Waldm√ºller, 1823, year of publication of the Piano Sonata No. 32 Beethoven conceived of the plan for his final three piano sonatas (Op. 109, 110 and 111) during the summer of 1820, while he worked on his Missa solemnis. Although the work was only seriously outlined by 1819, the famous first theme of the allegro ed appassionato was found in a draft book dating from 1801‚Äì1802, contemporary to his Second Symphony.Zwei Skizzenb√ºcher von B. aus den Jahren 1801 bis 1803, Breitkopf, pp. 19 and 14 ‚Äì cited by R. Rolland, in Beethoven: Les grandes √©poques cr√©atrices: Le chant de la r√©surrection ‚Äì Sablier editions, Paris, 1937, p. 517 Moreover, the study of these draft books implies that Beethoven initially had plans for a sonata in three movements, quite different from that which we know: it is only thereafter that the initial theme of the first movement became that of the String Quartet No. 13, and that what should have been used as the theme with the adagio‚Äîa slow melody in A‚Äîwas abandoned. Only the motif planned for the third movement, the famous theme mentioned above, was preserved to become that of the first movement.Rolland R., Beethoven: Les grandes √©poques cr√©atrices: Le chant de la r√©surrection ‚Äì Sablier editions, Paris, 1937, pp. 518‚Äì520 The Arietta, too, offers a considerable amount of research on its themes; the drafts found for this movement seem to indicate that as the second movement took form, Beethoven gave up the idea of a third movement, the sonata finally appearing to him as ideal.Rolland R., Beethoven: Les grandes √©poques cr√©atrices: Le chant de la r√©surrection ‚Äì Sablier editions, Paris, 1937, p. 513 Along with Beethoven's 33 Variations on a waltz by Anton Diabelli, Op. 120 (1823) and his two collections of bagatelles‚ÄîOp. 119 (1822) and Op. 126 (1823)‚Äîthe sonata was one of Beethoven's last compositions for piano. Nearly ignored by contemporaries, it was not until the second half of the 19th century that it found its way into the repertoire of most leading pianists.Jean Witold, Ludwig van Beethoven: The Man and His Work (Paris 1964), p. 140: \\"The sonata went almost unnoticed by contemporaries and it would be not until later that they came to understand its richness.\\" Structure The work is in two highly contrasting movements: Typical performances take 7‚Äì10 minutes for the first movement, and 15‚Äì20 minutes for the second, though the range of timings is wide. There are a few recordings that take more than 20 minutes for the second movement, e.g. Barenboim (21 minutes), Afanassiev (22 minutes) and Ugorski (27 minutes). I. Maestoso ‚Äì Allegro con brio ed appassionato Duration of roughly 9‚Äì11 minutes. The first movement, like many other works by Beethoven in C minor, is stormy and impassioned‚Äîthe tempo markings may be translated, respectively, as \\"majestic\\" and \\"brisk, with vigor and passion\\". It abounds in diminished seventh chords, as in for instance the first full bar of its opening introduction, which may have provided the inspiration for the introduction of Chopin's Second Piano Sonata: :550px Unlike Beethoven's other C minor sonata-form movements, the exposition of this movement moves to the submediant (A major), not to the mediant, as its second key area. The quiet second theme bears a resemblance to the second theme in the final movement of the fourteenth piano sonata, made even more explicit in the recapitulation where this theme is restated ominously in the bass in minor mode, after initially appearing in C major. Overall, the first movement contains motivic similarities with Mozart's Adagio and Fugue in C minor, which Beethoven arranged for a string quartet (Hess 37). The A major closing theme of the exposition, based on the first motif of the first theme, initiates a chromatic descent to its dominant with the motif A‚ÄìC‚ÄìG ‚Äì and the same motif appears in the theme's restatement in the recapitulation, this time at the culmination of the chromatic descent instead of at the beginning. This moment is also prepared by the inclusion of the minor-mode inflected flattened sixth (F) at the corresponding point in the exposition's closing theme. In a move that mirrors the Piano Sonata, Op. 49 No. 1, and the Cello Sonata, Op. 5 No. 2, Beethoven ends this movement with a Picardy third that directly prepares the major-mode finale. II. Arietta: Adagio molto semplice e cantabile Duration of roughly 14‚Äì30 minutes :700px The final movement, in C major, is a set of five variations on a 16-bar theme in , with a final coda. The last two variations (Var. 4 and 5) are famous for introducing small notes which constantly divide the bar into 27 beats, which is very uncommon. Beethoven eventually introduces a trill which gives the impression of a further acceleration. The tempo marking may be translated \\"slowly, very simple and songlike.\\" Beethoven's markings indicate that he wished variations 2‚Äì4 to be played to the same basic (ternary) pulse as the theme, first variation and subsequent sections (that is, each of the three intra-bar groupings move at the same speed regardless of time signature; Beethoven uses the direction \\"L'istesso tempo\\" at each change of time signature).Tovey, Donald Francis, Annotations to the Beethoven Piano Sonatas. London: Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, 1932 The simplified time signatures ( for and for ; both implying unmarked triplets) support this. However, in performance, the theme and first variation sound much slower, with wide spaces between the chords, and the second variation (and much more so, the third variation) faster, because of the shorter note values that create a doubling (and redoubling) of the effective compound time groupings. The third variation has a powerful, stomping, dance-like character with falling swung sixty-fourth notes, and heavy syncopation. Mitsuko Uchida has remarked that this variation, to a modern ear, has a striking resemblance to cheerful boogie-woogie, and the closeness of it to jazz and ragtime, which were still over 70 years into the future at the time, has often been pointed out. Jeremy Denk, for example, describes the second movement using terms like \\"proto-jazz\\" and \\"boogie-woogie\\". Conversely, Andr√°s Schiff denounces that hypothesis, maintaining that it has nothing to do with jazz or anything of the sort. From the fourth variation onwards the time signature returns to the original but divided into constant triplet thirty-second notes, effectively creating a doubly compound meter (equivalent to ). The work is one of the most famous compositions of the composer's \\"late period\\" and is widely performed and recorded. The pianist Robert Taub has called it \\"a work of unmatched drama and transcendence ... the triumph of order over chaos, of optimism over anguish.\\" John Lill sees Beethoven's struggle that permeates the first movement as physically challenging pianists performing this work; even in the opening of the sonata, for instance, there is a downward leap of a seventh in the left hand ‚Äì Beethoven is making his pianists physically struggle to reach the notes. Alfred Brendel commented of the second movement that \\"what is to be expressed here is distilled experience\\" and \\"perhaps nowhere else in piano literature does mystical experience feel so immediately close at hand\\".Liner notes on a Philips LP with Brendel playing Op. 111 and the Appassionnata, c. 1970. Asked by Anton Schindler why the work has only two movements (this was unusual for a classical sonata but not unique among Beethoven's works for piano), the composer is said to have replied \\"I didn't have the time to write a third movement.\\" However, according to Robert Greenberg, this may have just as easily been the composer's prickly personality shining through, since the balance between the two movements is such that it obviates the need for a third.Greenberg, Robert, \\"The Piano Sonatas of Beethoven\\" Lecture 24. The Teaching Company Jeremy Denk points out that Beethoven \\"whittles away everything down to the absolute difference of the two movements\\", \\"an Allegro and an Adagio, two opposed poles\\", and suggests that \\"as with the greatest Beethoven pieces, the structure itself becomes a message\\". Legacy Chopin greatly admired this sonata. In two of his works, the Second Piano Sonata and the Revolutionary √âtude, he alluded to the opening and ending of the sonata's first movement, respectivelyFor the allusion in Chopin's second piano sonata, see (compare the opening bars of the two sonatas, and bars 77‚Äì81 of Chopin's √âtude with bars 150‚Äì152 in the first movement of Beethoven's sonata). Prokofiev based the structure of his Symphony No. 2 on this sonata. In 2009, the Italian composer Lorenzo Ferrero wrote a composition for piano solo entitled Op. 111 ‚Äì Bagatella su Beethoven, which is a blend of themes from this sonata and Dmitri Shostakovich's musical monogram DSCH. The work is referenced in chapter 8 of Thomas Mann's novel Doktor Faustus. Wendell Kretschmar, the town organist and music teacher, delivers a lecture on the sonata to a bemused audience, in the fictional town of Kaisersaschern on the Saale, playing the piece on an old piano while declaiming his lecture over the music: In his technical musical excurses, Mann borrowed extensively from Theodor Adorno's ' (and Adorno indeed played this particular opus for Mann), to the extent that some critics consider him as the novel's tacit co-author. The influence is particularly strong in the passages outlining Kretschmar's lectures.Cobley (2002), p. 45 References External links *Free recordings at Musopen Recording by , Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum Piano Sonata 32 1822 compositions Compositions in C minor Music with dedications ","title":"Piano Sonata No. 32 (Beethoven)"},{"id":"713564","text":"Live Wire or Livewire, in comics, may refer to: * Live Wire (Marvel Comics), a Marvel Comics supervillain * Live Wire (DC Comics), an alias of the Legion of Super-Heroes member Garth Ranzz, aka Lightning Lad * Livewire (DC Comics), a DC Comics supervillainess * Livewire (Valiant Comics), a Valiant Comics character * Livewires (comics), a Marvel Comics series * Livewire (Image Comics), a character from Savage Dragon and a member of the Vicious Circle (comics) See also *Livewire (disambiguation) References ","title":"Live Wire (comics)"},{"id":"713566","text":"This is a list of hospitals in Nicaragua. *Bautista Hospital *Bertha Calder√≥n (De la Mujer) Hospital *Carlos Marx (Alem√°n-Nicarag√ºense) Hospital *Alejandro Davila Bola√±os Hospital (Military) *Japanese-Nicaraguan Hospital (Hospital Japon√©s-Nicarag√ºense) *Manuel de Jes√∫s Rivera,\\"La Mascota\\" Hospital *Antonio Lenin Fonseca (Trauma) Hospital *Manolo Morales (Roberto Calder√≥n) Hospital *Hospital Salud Integral *Metropolitano Vivian Pellas Private Hospital *Psychiatric Hospital *Fernando V√©lez Paiz, Pediatric Hospital *La Mascota Pediatric Hospital *Hospital Regional Santiago (Jinotepe, Carazo) *Hospital San Jos√© (Diriamba, Carazo) *Hospital Santa Gema, Masaya (offers 24hr emergency) References Nicaragua Hospitals Hospitals N H  ","title":"List of hospitals in Nicaragua"},{"id":"713569","text":"Waimea Canyon, also known as the Grand Canyon of the Pacific, is a large canyon, approximately ten miles (16 km) long and up to 3,000 feet (900 m) deep, located on the western side of Kauai in the Hawaiian Islands of the United States. Waimea is Hawaiian for \\"reddish water\\", a reference to the erosion of the canyon's red soil.Pukui, Mary Kawena. Place Names of Hawaii. University of Hawaii Press. . The canyon was formed by a deep incision of the Waimea River arising from the extreme rainfall on the island's central peak, Mount Waialeale, among the wettest places on earth. Geology The canyon is carved into the tholeiitic and post-shield calc-alkaline lavas of the canyon basalt. The lavas of the canyon provide evidence for massive faulting and collapse in the early history of the island. The west side of the canyon is all thin, west-dipping lavas of the Napali Member, while the east side is very thick, flat-lying lavas of the Olokele and Makaweli Members. The two sides are separated by an enormous fault along which a large part of the island moved downwards in a big collapse. The canyon has a unique geologic history as it was formed not only by the steady process of erosion but also by a catastrophic collapse of the volcano that created Kauai. Like the other Hawaiian islands, Kauai is the top of an enormous volcano rising from the ocean floor. With lava flows dated to about 5 million years ago, Kauai is the oldest of the large Hawaiian islands. Roughly 4 million years ago, while Kauai was still erupting almost continuously, a portion of the island collapsed. This collapse formed a depression which then filled with lava flows. In the time since, rainwater from the slopes of Mount Waialeale have eroded Waimea Canyon along one edge of the collapse. On the east side of the canyon, the cliff walls are built from thick lava flows that pooled in the depression. Over time, the exposed basalt has weathered from its original black to bright red. Geography Waimea Canyon State Park encompasses 1,866 acres (7.5 km2) and is a popular tourist attraction on the island. It provides a wilderness area with numerous hiking trails. It can be accessed from Waimea on Hawai ªi state road 550, which is 18 miles long and leads up to K≈çke ªe State Park. The island of Ni ªihau, only a short distance west of Kaua ªi at that point, can be clearly seen from the highway.

R. Martin. It was first published on August 1, 1996. The novel won the 1997 Locus Award and was nominated for both the 1997 Nebula Award and the 1997 World Fantasy Award. The novella Blood of the Dragon, comprising the Daenerys Targaryen chapters from the novel, won the 1997 Hugo Award for Best Novella. In January 2011, the novel became a New York Times Bestseller and reached No. 1 on the list in July 2011. In the novel, recounting events from various points of view, Martin introduces the plot-lines of the noble houses of Westeros, the Wall, and the Targaryens. The novel has inspired several spin-off works, including several games. It is also the namesake and basis for the first season of Game of Thrones, an HBO television series that premiered in April 2011. A March 2013 paperback TV tie-in re-edition was also titled Game of Thrones, excluding the indefinite article \\"A\\". Plot A Game of Thrones follows three principal storylines simultaneously. In the Seven Kingdoms Upon the death of Lord Jon Arryn, the principal advisor to King Robert Baratheon, Robert recruits his childhood friend Eddard \\"Ned\\" Stark, now lord of the North, to replace Arryn as \\"Hand of the King\\", and to betroth his daughter Sansa to Robert's son Joffrey. Ned accepts the position when he learns that Arryn's widow Lysa believes he was poisoned by Robert's wife Queen Cersei Lannister and her family. Shortly thereafter, Ned's son Bran discovers Cersei having sex with her twin brother Jaime Lannister, who throws Bran from the tower to conceal their affair, leaving him comatose and paralyzing his legs. Ned leaves his castle Winterfell and departs for the capital city, King's Landing, bringing along his daughters Sansa and Arya. Upon arriving in King's Landing to take his post as Hand, Ned finds that Robert is an ineffective king whose only interests are hunting, drinking and womanizing. At Winterfell, an assassin attempts to kill Bran while he is unconscious, and Ned's wife Catelyn travels to King's Landing to bring word to Ned. Catelyn's childhood friend, Petyr \\"Littlefinger\\" Baelish, implicates Tyrion Lannister, the dwarf brother of Cersei and Jaime, in the assassination attempt. En route back to Winterfell, Catelyn encounters Tyrion by chance, arrests him, and takes him to stand trial for the attempt on Bran's life. In retaliation for Tyrion's abduction, his father Lord Tywin Lannister sends soldiers to raid the Riverlands, Catelyn's home region. Tyrion regains his freedom by recruiting a mercenary named Bronn to defend him in trial by combat. Ned investigates Jon Arryn's death and eventually discovers that Robert's legal heirs, including Joffrey, are in fact Cersei's children by Jaime, and that Jon Arryn was killed to conceal his discovery of their incest. Ned offers Cersei a chance to flee before he informs Robert, but she uses this chance to arrange Robert's death in a hunting accident and install Joffrey on the throne. Ned prepares to send his daughters away from King's Landing and enlists Littlefinger's help to challenge Joffrey's claim; but Littlefinger betrays him, resulting in Ned's arrest. Arya escapes the castle, but Sansa is taken hostage by the Lannisters. Ned's eldest son Robb marches his army south in response to his father's arrest, and in order to relieve the threat on the Riverlands. To secure a strategically necessary bridge crossing, Catelyn negotiates a marital alliance between Robb and the notoriously unreliable House Frey. Robb defeats a Lannister army in the Riverlands, capturing Jaime. Tywin sends Tyrion back to King's Landing to act as Hand of the King to Joffrey. When Ned is executed, Robb's followers declare the North's independence from the Seven Kingdoms, proclaiming Robb \\"King in the North\\". On the Wall  The prologue of the novel introduces the Wall: an ancient barrier of stone, ice, and magic, hundreds of feet high and hundreds of miles long, shielding the Seven Kingdoms from the northern wilderness. The Wall is manned by the Night's Watch: an order of warriors sworn to serve there for life, defending the realm from the fabled Others, an ancient and hostile inhuman race, as well as from the human \\"wildlings\\" who live north of the Wall. Jon Snow, Ned's bastard son, is inspired by his uncle, Benjen Stark, to join the Night's Watch, but becomes disillusioned when he discovers that its primary function is as a penal colony. Jon unites his fellow recruits against their harsh instructor and protects the cowardly but good-natured and intelligent Samwell Tarly. Jon is appointed steward to the leader of the Watch, Lord Commander Jeor Mormont, making him a potential successor to Mormont. Benjen fails to return from an expedition north of the Wall. Six months later, the dead bodies of two men from his party are recovered; these re-animate as undead wights before being dispatched by Jon. When word of his father's execution reaches Jon, he attempts to join Robb against the Lannisters, but is persuaded to remain loyal to the Watch. Mormont then declares his intention to march north to find Benjen, dead or alive, and to investigate rumors of a \\"King-Beyond-the-Wall\\" uniting the wildlings. Across the narrow sea Across the sea to the east of Westeros live the exiled prince Viserys and princess Daenerys, children of the late \\"mad king\\" Aerys Targaryen, who ruled Westeros before being overthrown by Robert Baratheon. Viserys betroths Daenerys to Khal Drogo, a warlord of the nomadic Dothraki, in exchange for the use of Drogo's army to reclaim the throne of Westeros. Illyrio, a wealthy merchant who has been supporting the penniless Targaryens, gives Daenerys three petrified dragon eggs as a wedding gift. Jorah Mormont, a knight exiled from Westeros, joins Viserys as an adviser. Initially terrified of her new husband and his people, Daenerys eventually embraces her role as Drogo's queen. Drogo, however, shows little interest in conquering Westeros, and an impatient Viserys tries to browbeat his sister into coercing Drogo. When Viserys publicly threatens Daenerys, Drogo executes him by pouring molten gold on his head. An assassin seeking King Robert's favor attempts to poison Daenerys and her unborn child, finally convincing Drogo to conquer Westeros. While sacking villages to fund the invasion of Westeros, Drogo is badly wounded, and Daenerys commands the captive folk healer Mirri Maz Duur to save him. The healer, angered by the Dothraki raids against her people, sacrifices Daenerys' unborn child to power the spell to save Drogo's life, which restores Drogo's physical health but leaves him in a persistent vegetative state. With Drogo completely incapacitated and unable to lead, much of the Dothraki army disperses. Daenerys smothers Drogo with a pillow and has Mirri tied to Drogo's funeral pyre. She places her three dragon eggs on the pyre and enters it herself. When the fire burns out, she emerges unharmed, with three newly hatched dragons. Awe-struck, Jorah and the remaining Dothraki swear allegiance to her.  Themes  Throughout the novel, characters are often faced with decisions that match one redeemable trait against another. The Guardian outlines characters who are frequently \\"forced to choose between their love for those close to them and the greater interests of honour, duty and the realm.\\" In Westeros, Ned ultimately decides to venture south with Robert, leaving much of his family in Winterfell. At the Wall, Jon wrestles with the predicament of joining his half-brother Robb in rebellion or staying with his sworn brothers in the Night's Watch. Daenerys has issue with the Dothraki treatment of those they conquered in Essos. These conflicts characters encounter oftentimes reflect inconsistent decision making. Catelyn initially is overwhelmed by grief and does not leave Bran's bedside while he is comatose, ignoring her political responsibilities, choosing family over duty. But soon after, Catelyn leaves Bran and her family for Kings Landing to inform Ned of potential Lannister treason, effectively displaying a more duty fulfilling role. Family, duty, and honor play major roles in conflicts that arise in the story arc, and qualities traditionally categorized as noble oppose each other in resolution. Character decision conflicts and consequence analysis are particular to how Martin wants to portray fantasy. Martin characteristically deviates from the traditional fantasy model and clear-cut lines of good versus evil. Martin reflects: \\"I think the battle between good and evil is fought largely within the individual human heart, by the decisions that we make. It's not like evil dresses up in black clothing and you know, they're really ugly\\". This viewpoint characterizes the book and is evident in the actions of several different families which frequently have conflicts with each other. The Starks' and Lannisters' conflict is a central component of the novel, and the reader receives points of view from both sides. Likewise, Daenerys' storyline develops around the Targaryen's upheaval in Westeros, in which the Starks played a significant role. Martin argues: > Having multiple viewpoints is crucial to the grayness of the characters. You > have to be able to see the struggle from both sides, because real human > beings in a war have all these processes of self-justification, telling > ourselves why what we're doing is the right thing. Viewpoint characters Each chapter concentrates on the third person limited point of view of a single character; the book presents the perspective of eight main characters. Additionally, a minor character provides the prologue. Chapter headings indicate the perspective. * Prologue: Will, a man of the Night's Watch. * Lord Eddard \\"Ned\\" Stark, Warden of the North and Lord of Winterfell, Hand of the King. * Lady Catelyn Stark, of House Tully, wife of Eddard Stark. * Sansa Stark, elder daughter of Eddard and Catelyn Stark. * Arya Stark, younger daughter of Eddard and Catelyn Stark. * Bran Stark, middle son of Eddard and Catelyn Stark. * Jon Snow, illegitimate son of Eddard Stark. * Tyrion Lannister, a dwarf, brother of the twins Queen Cersei and Jaime, son of Lord Tywin Lannister. * Princess Daenerys Targaryen, Stormborn, the Princess of Dragonstone and heiress to the Targaryen throne after her older brother Viserys Targaryen. In the later books, certain viewpoint characters are added while others are removed. Writing Martin acknowledges several authors who lent their time and expertise during the writing of the novel: Sage Walker, Martin Wright, Melinda Snodgrass, Carl Keim, Bruce Baugh, Tim O'Brien, Roger Zelazny, Jane Lindskold, and Laura Mixon. Editions The HarperCollins/ Voyager 1996 edition was the British first edition. Its official publication date was earlier than that of the US Bantam edition, but Bantam went to print several months earlier to hand out copies at the American Booksellers Association (ABA). The novel has been translated into many languages and published in multiple editions in hardcover, paperback, e-book, and audio book form. In different languages, the number of books may not be the same. In June 2000, Meisha Merlin published a limited edition of the book, fully illustrated by Jeffrey Jones. Adaptations A Game of Thrones and the subsequent novels in the A Song of Ice and Fire series have been adapted in a HBO television series, a comics series, several card, board and video games, and other media. Reception A Game of Thrones has received critical acclaim. Lauren K. Nathan of the Associated Press wrote that the book \\"grip[s] the reader from Page One\\" and is set in a \\"magnificent\\" fantasy world that is \\"mystical, but still believable.\\" Steve Perry told readers of The Oregonian that the plot is \\"complex and fascinating\\" and the book is \\"rich and colorful\\" with \\"all the elements of a great fantasy novel\\". Writing in The Washington Post, John H. Riskind commented that \\"many fans of sword-and-sorcery will enjoy the epic scope of this book\\" but felt that the book \\"suffers from one- dimensional characters and less than memorable imagery.\\" Phyllis Eisenstein of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that, although the book uses many generic fantasy tropes, Martin's approach is \\"so refreshingly human and intimate that it transcends them.\\" She described it as \\"an absorbing combination of the mythic, the sweepingly historical, and the intensely personal.\\" John Prior, writing in the San Diego Union-Tribune, called Martin's writing \\"strong and imaginative, with plenty of Byzantine intrigue and dynastic struggle\\", and compared it to Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time books, \\"though much darker, with no comedy or romance to relieve the nastiness.\\" On November 5, 2019, the BBC News listed A Game of Thrones on its list of the 100 most influential novels.

He is also the founder and the chairman of the American Civil Rights Institute, a national non-profit organization in opposition to racial and gender preferences, and is the president of Californians for Equal Rights, a non-profit organization active in the state of California with a similar mission. He is considered to be the man behind California's Proposition 209 prohibiting race- and gender-based preferences in state hiring, contracting and state university admissions, a program known as affirmative action. Early life Wardell Anthony Connerly was born in Leesville, Louisiana in 1939. Connerly has said that he is one-fourth black and half-white, with the rest a mix of Irish, French, and Choctaw American Indian. He identifies as multiracial. He grew up in an African-American community, but the children met some discrimination in school because of their light skin. In a Louisiana state census, the family were classified as \\"colored\\", a category that historically covered the Louisiana Creole people (other categories were negro and white).Jessie Carney Smith, Millicent Lownes Jackson, Linda T. Wynn, \\"Ward Connerly\\", Encyclopedia of African American Business: A-J, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006, p. 200, accessed 22 February 2011 His father, Roy Connerly, left the household when Ward was 2, and his mother died when he was 4. The young Connerly lived first with Bertha and James Louis, his maternal aunt and uncle. They moved to Bremerton, Washington and then to Sacramento, California, as part of the Great Migration by millions of blacks out of the South in the first half of the 20th century to seek better opportunities. Connerly next lived with his maternal grandmother, Mary Smith Soneia, who had also moved to Sacramento. (She was the daughter of a Choctaw man and white woman, and she had married a Cajun of mixed heritage.) When she had difficulty supporting the two of them, Ward took many jobs as a boy. Connerly attended Sacramento State College, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts with honors in political science in 1962. While in college, Connerly was student body president, was active as a Young Democrat, and joined Delta Phi Omega, a white fraternity. Later he was made an honorary member of Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity. During his college years, Connerly campaigned against housing discrimination and helped to get a bill passed by the state legislature banning the practice. Marriage and family Since 1962, Connerly has been married to Ilene Crews, a woman of European-American descent, whom he started dating in college. They have two children. She is his equal partner in the firm of Connerly & Associates. In addition to his political activities, Connerly is a member of the Rotary Club of Sacramento, California. Career After college, Connerly worked for a number of state agencies and Assembly committees, where he developed a broad range of contacts. He worked for the Sacramento re-development agency, the state department of housing and urban development, and the State Assembly committee on urban affairs. During the late 1960s, Connerly became friends with then-legislator Pete Wilson (who would become governor in 1991). Encouraged by Wilson, Connerly left his government job in 1973. He started his own consulting and land-use planning company, known as Connerly and Associates, Inc., and together with his wife as partner, made a strong success of it. In 1993 he was appointed to the University of California Board of Regents, where he served until March 2005. During this time, he became deeply involved in working to repeal state affirmative action programs. Campaign against racial preferences After his appointment to the University of California board of regents in 1993, Connerly began to learn more about the workings of its affirmative action program. In 1994, he heard from Jerry and Ellan Cook, whose son had been rejected at the University of California, San Francisco (UC) Medical School. Connerly became convinced that affirmative action, as practiced by UC, was another kind of racial discrimination. Cook, a statistician, had presented data showing that white and Asian students were being denied admission despite having better grades and test scores than other students who were being admitted. Connerly proposed abolishing the controversial racially based programs, while allowing the university to consider social or economic factors. The regents passed the proposal in January 1996 despite protests from activist Jesse Jackson and other supporters of affirmative action. The year after affirmative action was abolished, the number of Asian students admitted to UC increased markedly. The UC regents developed a new system, including essay requirements that served to reveal the applicant's race and ethnicity. The new measures, titled \\"comprehensive review\\" have not yet been challenged to the California Supreme Court or the Supreme Court of the United States. In 1995, Connerly became the chairman of the California Civil Rights Initiative Campaign and helped get the initiative on the California ballot as Proposition 209. The Carnegie, Ford, and Rockefeller Foundations, the ACLU, and the California Teachers Association opposed the measure. It passed with 54.6% of the vote. In 1997, Connerly formed the American Civil Rights Institute. ACRI supported a similar ballot measure in Washington state, Initiative 200, which would later pass with 58.2% of the vote. Connerly had a salary of $314,079 combined from the ACRI and American Civil Rights Coalition in addition to over $400,000 in speaking and consulting fees in 2002; nearly half of his salary reimbursed his Connerly & Associates land and housing consulting firm. ACRI worked to get a measure on the ballot in the 2000 Florida election. The Florida Supreme Court put restrictions on the petition language. Though Governor Jeb Bush, like the previous governor, opposed the petition as a public initiative, Bush sympathized with its key goals. Bush eventually proposed a program \\"One Florida\\" which implemented key portions of Connerly's proposal. In 2003, Connerly helped place Proposition 54 on the California ballot, which would prohibit the government from classifying any person by race, ethnicity, color, or national origin, with some exceptions, such as for medical research. Critics were concerned that such a measure would make it difficult to track housing discrimination and racial profiling activities. Editorials in newspapers such as the San Francisco Chronicle and Los Angeles Times criticized the measure, saying that the lack of such information would hamper legitimate medical and scientific purposes. The voters did not pass the measure. In 2003 the Supreme Court ruled on affirmative action programs at the University of Michigan in Gratz v. Bollinger and Grutter v. Bollinger; it ruled the undergraduate affirmative action program was unconstitutional for the way it applied the program, but that the process at the University of Michigan law school could continue. Jennifer Gratz invited Connerly to Michigan to support a referendum measure similar to the 1996 California amendment. The Michigan Civil Rights Initiative appeared on the November 2006 Michigan ballot and was passed 58% to 42%. For the 2008 elections, Connerly headed a campaign which he called \\"Super Tuesday for Equal Rights\\". It was directed at dismantling affirmative action programs in five different states via ballot measures. In three of the states, Connerly's initiatives failed to make it onto the ballot. In Colorado, voters rejected Amendment 46 (or the Colorado Civil Rights Initiative) by a very slim margin. Voters in Nebraska were the only ones to approve a new anti-affirmative action measure, called Initiative 424. Political views Party identification Ward Connerly identifies as a Republican with a libertarian philosophy. In January 2008, Connerly endorsed Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani. Support for domestic partnership benefits Despite his close political relationship with former California Governor Pete Wilson, and their agreement on the question of affirmative action, Connerly led efforts to grant domestic partner benefits to gay and lesbian domestic partners in all state universities over Wilson's objections. The UC Regents narrowly passed the initiative. Connerly says his views on gay rights stem from his libertarian viewpoint that governments, including government-run universities, should not discriminate, whether it is by favoring some students because of their race, or by excluding others from spousal benefits based on their sexual orientation. The conservative advocacy groups Family Research Council and Traditional Values Coalition criticized Connerly's support for domestic partner benefits. In reference to Connerly, Robert H. Knight, Director of Cultural Studies at the Family Research Council], said, \\"no true conservative would equate homosexual households with marriages, because we believe that without marriage and family as paramount values, hell will break loose.\\" Support of same-sex marriage In response to Proposition 8 on California's November 2008 ballot that would ban same-sex marriage in California, Connerly stated, \\"For anyone to say that this is an issue for people who are gay and that this isn't about civil rights is sadly mistaken. If you really believe in freedom and limited government, to be intellectually consistent and honest you have to oppose efforts of the majority to impose their will on people.\\" Support of multi- racial category on government forms On July 9, 1997, the American Civil Rights Institute expressed disappointment with the federal government's decision to reject the addition of a multi-racial category on the Census and other government forms that collect racial data. Since 2000, the Census Bureau has allowed individuals to identify more than one racial/ethnic category on the census form, although it does not yet have a multiracial category.David L. Brunsma, \\"Public Categories, Private Identities: Exploring Regional Differences in the Biracial Experience\\", Social Science Research, Vol. 35, No. 3, Sept 2006, pp. 555-576, accessed 22 February 2011 Connerly began to ally with prominent members of what has become known as the multiracial movement. Prior to leading the Racial Privacy Initiative (Proposition 54) in California, Connerly forged ties with the publishers of Interracial Voice and The Multiracial Activist, prominent publications for the multiracial movement. Eventually, Connerly enlisted the help of several outspoken members of the multiracial movement to assist with the campaign for the Racial Privacy Initiative. Reception Personal In 1995, then California State Senator (and later congresswoman) Diane Watson said about Connerly, \\"He's married to a white woman. He wants to be white. He wants a colorless society. He has no ethnic pride. He doesn't want to be black.\\" Jeff Jacoby, a columnist for The Boston Globe, characterized this attack as part of the personal abuse conservative blacks received from liberal blacks who opposed their programs. After Connerly published his autobiography, Creating Equal: My Fight Against Race Preferences in 2000, some relatives claimed his accounts of an impoverished childhood were exaggerated or false. Connerly's aunt Bertha Louis, whom he had lived with and who was close to his grandmother, confirmed his account and said his detractors \\"are just lyin' on him. It's jealousy and it's hatred, as low as you can get.\\" Affirmative action and desegregation Asked in 2003 if Proposition 54 could derail school integration efforts in California, Connerly said: \\"I don't care whether they are segregated or not‚Ä¶ kids need to be learning, and I place more value on these kids getting educated than I do on whether we have some racial balancing or not.\\" Connerly's opposition to affirmative action has generated both opposition and support. * Connerly believes affirmative action is a form of racism and that people can achieve success without preferential treatment in college enrollment or in employment. He thinks that selective affirmative action discriminates against minorities such as Asian Indians and South East Asians, as some of their people have experienced discrimination in the past, but they do not receive the benefits of race-based admissions. Critics contend Connerly fails to recognize the damaging extent of past racism for African Americans and Hispanics, that contemporary institutionalized racism is pervasive and powerful, and that affirmative action can overcome the residual effects of past discrimination on people of color. In 1995, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that as CEO of Connerly & Associates, Inc., Connerly benefited financially from state affirmative action programs in contracting. BAMN opposed Connerly's efforts to put the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative on the 2006 Michigan Ballot, and disrupted a Michigan Board of Canvassers meeting that year in protest. In relation to Attacking Affirmative Action, a program on Now on PBS in August 2008, Connerly said, > I think that in some quarters, many parts of the country, a white male is > really disadvantaged‚Ä¶ Because we have developed this notion of women and > minorities being so disadvantaged and we have to help them, that we have, in > many cases, twisted the thing so that it's no longer a case of equal > opportunity. It's a case of putting a fist on the scale. Legacy and honors * He published an autobiography Creating Equal: My Fight Against Race Preference in 2000, * He was made an honorary member of Sigma Phi Epsilon, a fraternity founded at the University of Richmond in 1901. * Connerly was inducted as a lifetime member into the California Building Industry Hall of Fame.

R. Martin expected to consist of seven volumes. It was first published on 16 November 1998 in the United Kingdom, although the first United States edition did not follow until February 2, 1999https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91973.A_Clash_of_Kings . Like its predecessor, A Game of Thrones, it won the Locus Award (in 1999) for Best Novel and was nominated for the Nebula Award (also in 1999) for best novel. In May 2005 Meisha Merlin released a limited edition of the novel, fully illustrated by John Howe. The novel has been adapted for television by HBO as the second season of the TV series Game of Thrones. A Clash of Kings is also the name of the first expansion to the Game of Thrones board game.  Plot summary  A Clash of Kings depicts the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros in civil war, while the Night's Watch mounts a reconnaissance to investigate the mysterious people known as wildlings. Meanwhile, Daenerys Targaryen continues her plan to reconquer the Seven Kingdoms. In the Seven Kingdoms With King Robert Baratheon dead, his purported son Joffrey and his brothers Renly and Stannis all claim the throne of the Seven Kingdoms. Two regions attempt to secede from the realm: Robb Stark is declared \\"King in the North\\" while Balon Greyjoy declares himself king of the Iron Islands. The war among these contenders is dubbed the War of the Five Kings. Stannis Baratheon, claiming the throne as Robert's eldest brother and therefore heir, is supported by Melisandre, a foreign priestess who believes Stannis a prophesied messianic figure. Renly is supported by the wealthy Lord Mace Tyrell, and has married Mace's daughter Margaery. Robb's mother Catelyn Stark meets with Renly and Stannis to discuss an alliance against Joffrey's family, the Lannisters, but she is unable to reach an agreement with them. Melisandre uses magic to send a shadow to assassinate Renly; after witnessing Renly's death, Catelyn and Renly's bodyguard Brienne of Tarth flee the scene. Tyrion Lannister, Joffrey's uncle, arrives at the capital city of King's Landing as acting Hand of the King, the senior adviser to Joffrey's reign. Tyrion improves the defenses of the city while jockeying for power against Joffrey's mother, the Queen Regent Cersei. Learning of Renly's death, Tyrion sends the crown's treasurer Petyr ‚ÄúLittlefinger‚Äù Baelish to win the Tyrells' support for Joffrey. Robb's sister Sansa, a hostage of the Lannisters, is regularly abused by Joffrey's guards. Riots break out in the city due to Joffrey's cruelty and food shortages caused by the ongoing war. Robb wins several victories against the Lannisters while his younger brother Bran rules the Northern stronghold of Winterfell in his absence. Robb sends his friend Theon Greyjoy, Balon Greyjoy's son, to negotiate an alliance between the North and the Iron Islands. Theon betrays Robb and attacks Winterfell, taking the castle and capturing Bran and his younger brother Rickon. When Bran and Rickon escape, Theon fakes their deaths. Stark supporters besiege the castle, including a force from the Starks' sometime ally House Bolton. However, the Bolton soldiers turn against the Stark and Greyjoy forces alike, burn Winterfell, slaughter its inhabitants, and take Theon prisoner. Robb's sister Arya is taken north posing as a new recruit for the Night's Watch. The recruits are attacked by Lannister forces, and the survivors are taken to the gigantic castle of Harrenhal, which is controlled by Joffrey's grandfather Tywin Lannister. For saving his life during the attack, a mysterious man named Jaqen H'ghar promises to repay Arya by killing three men of her choice. Arya leverages this offer to help Northern forces retake control of Harrenhal. Jaqen gives Arya a mysterious iron coin and tells her to find him in the foreign city of Braavos if she should ever desire to learn his secrets. Arya soon escapes the castle. Stannis's army launches an amphibious assault on King's Landing in a battle on Blackwater Bay. Under Tyrion's command, the Lannister forces use \\"wildfire\\" (a substance similar to Greek fire) to ignite the bay, and raise a massive chain across its mouth to prevent Stannis' fleet from retreating. Tywin leads his army and the Tyrell forces to the defense of King's Landing, and Stannis's forces are defeated. During the battle, Tyrion is attacked and injured by a knight of Joffrey's Kingsguard; by the time Tyrion regains consciousness after the battle, Tywin has assumed the post of Hand of the King. Beyond the Wall A scouting party from the Night's Watch learns that the wildlings are uniting under \\"King-beyond-the-Wall\\" Mance Rayder. The Lord Commander of the Watch, Jeor Mormont, assigns Jon Snow to a group sent to investigate Mance's aims, led by Qhorin Halfhand. Hunted by wildling warriors and facing certain defeat, Halfhand commands Jon to infiltrate the wildlings and learn their plans. To win the wildlings' trust, Jon is forced to kill Qhorin. He learns that Mance Rayder is advancing towards the Wall that separates the wildlings from the Seven Kingdoms with an army of thirty thousand wildlings, giants, and mammoths. Across the Narrow Sea Daenerys Targaryen travels east, accompanied by the knight Jorah Mormont, her remaining followers, and three newly hatched dragons. At the city of Qarth Daenerys's dragons make her notorious. Xaro Xhoan Daxos, a prominent trader in Qarth, initially befriends her; but Daenerys cannot secure aid because she refuses to give away any of her dragons. As a last resort, Daenerys seeks counsel from the warlocks of Qarth, who show Daenerys many confusing visions and threaten her life, whereupon one of Daenerys' dragons burns down the warlocks' House of the Undying.

(\\"Game of Thrones 2A: Descendants of the Golden Lion\\", \\"Game of Thrones 2B: Seven Kingdoms\\") Television adaptation A Clash of Kings has been adapted for television by HBO as the second season of its successful adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire. Filming began July 2011, and the first episode of season 2 of Game of Thrones aired on April 1, 2012. Reception As with its predecessor, A Clash of Kings was positively received by critics. Dorman Shindler of The Dallas Morning News described it as \\"one of the best [works] in this particular subgenre\\", praising \\"the richness of this invented world and its cultures ... [that] lends Mr. Martin's novels the feeling of medieval history rather than fiction.\\" Writing in The San Diego Union-Tribune, Jim Hopper called A Clash of Kings \\"High Fantasy with a vengeance\\" and commented: \\"I'll admit to staying up too late one night last week to finish off this big book, and I hope it's not too terribly long until the next one comes out.\\" Danielle Pilon wrote in the Winnipeg Free Press that the book \\"shows no signs of the usual 'middle book' aimlessness\\". Although she found the constantly switching viewpoints \\"momentarily confusing\\", she felt that it \\"draws the reader deep into the labyrinthine political and military intrigues and evokes sympathy for characters on all sides of the conflict.\\" Bradley H. Sinor of the Tulsa World praised Martin for \\"keep[ing] readers balanced on a sword's edge\\" and managing to do \\"three important things\\" with A Clash of Kings: \\"It grips the reader whether or not they read the earlier book, tells a satisfying story and leaves the reader wanting the next book as soon as possible.\\" The Oregonian's Steve Perry called the book \\"easily as good as the first novel\\" and commented that the Song of Ice and Fire books were \\"so complex, fascinating and well-rendered that readers will almost certainly be hooked into the whole series.\\" However, he cautioned that \\"if it were a movie, it would be rated \\"R\\" for sex and violence, so don't pick the book up for your 10-year-old nephew who likes Conan.\\" Awards and nominations * Locus Award ‚Äì Best Novel (Fantasy) (Won) ‚Äì (1999) * Nebula Award ‚Äì Best Novel (Nominated) ‚Äì (1999) * Ignotus Award ‚Äì Best Novel (Foreign) (Won) ‚Äì (2004) References External links 1998 American novels 1998 fantasy novels A Song of Ice and Fire books American fantasy novels Novels adapted into television shows Novels by George R.

A family genealogy was drawn up by Johann Sebastian Bach himself in 1735, his 50th year, and completed by his son Carl Philipp Emanuel. The Bach family never left Thuringia until the sons of J.S. Bach went into a more modern world. Through all the misery of the peasantry at the period of the Thirty Years' War this clan maintained its position and produced musicians who, however local their fame, were among the greatest in Europe. So numerous and so eminent were they that in Erfurt musicians were known as \\"Bachs\\", even when there were no longer any members of the family in the town. Sebastian Bach thus inherited the artistic tradition of a united family whose circumstances had deprived them of the distractions of the century of musical fermentation which in the rest of Europe had destroyed polyphonic music. Ancestors of Johann Sebastian Bach Family house, Wechmar Four branches of the Bach family were known at the beginning of the 16th century, and a Hans Bach of Wechmar is documented to have been alive in 1561, a village between Gotha and Arnstadt in Thuringia, who is believed to be the father of Veit Bach. * Veit (Vitus) Bach (c. 1550 ‚Äì 1619, Wechmar) was, according to Johann Sebastian's genealogy, \\"a white-bread baker in Hungary\\" who had to flee Hungary because he was a Lutheran, settling in Wechmar. He \\"found the greatest pleasure in a little cittern which he took with him even into the mill\\". * His son (c. 1580 ‚Äì 1626) \\"'\\" (lit. \\"the player\\"), was the first professional musician of the family. \\"At first took up the trade of baker, but having a particular bent for music\\" he became a piper. * His second grandson Christoph (1613‚Äì1661) was an instrumentalist. * His first great- grandson Johann Ambrosius was a violinist, and the father of Johann Sebastian Bach. Others born before 1685 Johann Ambrosius' uncle, Heinrich of Arnstadt, had two sons: Johann Michael and Johann Christoph, who are among the greatest of J. S. Bach's forerunners, Johann Christoph being once supposed to be the author of the motet, ' (I will not leave you), formerly ascribed to Sebastian Bach and now confirmed to be his (BWV 159a). Another descendant of Veit Bach, Johann Ludwig, was admired more than any other ancestor by Sebastian, who copied twelve of his church cantatas and sometimes added work of his own to them. Descendants of Johann Sebastian Bach * Of the seven children that Johann Sebastian Bach had with his first wife Maria Barbara Bach, his second cousin, only three survived him. Two of these had musical careers of their own: Wilhelm Friedemann and Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach. * After his first wife died, Johann Sebastian Bach then married Anna Magdalena Wilcken, herself a gifted soprano and daughter of the court trumpeter of Prince Saxe-Weissenfels. They had 13 children, of whom Johann Christoph Friedrich and Johann Christian became significant musicians. A further four survived into adulthood: Gottfried Heinrich; Elisabeth Juliane Friederica (1726‚Äì1781), who married Bach's pupil Johann Christoph Altnickol; Johanna Carolina (1737‚Äì1781); and Regina Susanna (1742‚Äì1809).The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, \\"Bach Family\\", pp. 98, 111 Partial family tree Expanded genealogy *Veit Bach (about 1550‚Äì1619) ** (d. 1626) (son of Veit Bach) ***Johann(es) Bach III (1604‚Äì1673) ‚Äì the so-called Erfurt Line ****Johann Christian Bach I (1640‚Äì1682) *****Johann Jacob Bach II (1668‚Äì1692) *****Johann Christoph Bach IV (1673‚Äì1727) ******Johann Samuel Bach (1694‚Äì1720) ******Johann Christian Bach II (1696‚Äì) ******Johann G√ºnther Bach II (1703‚Äì1756) ****Johann Aegidius Bach I (1645‚Äì1716) *****Johann Balthasar Bach (1673‚Äì1691) *****Johann Bernhard Bach I (1676‚Äì1749) ******Johann Ernst Bach II (1722‚Äì1777) *******Johann Georg Bach I (1751‚Äì1797) *****Johann Christoph Bach VI (1685‚Äì1740) ******Johann Friedrich Bach II (1706‚Äì1743) ******Johann Aegidius Bach II (1709‚Äì1746) ****Johann Nicolaus Bach I (1653‚Äì1682) ***Christoph Bach (1613‚Äì1661) ****Georg Christoph Bach (1642‚Äì1697) *****Johann Valentin Bach (1669‚Äì1720) ******Johann Lorenz Bach (1695‚Äì1773) ******Johann Elias Bach (1705‚Äì1755) *******Johann Michael Bach III (1745‚Äì1820) ‚Äì the music theorist ********Johann Georg Bach II (1786‚Äì1874) ********Georg Friedrich Bach (1792‚Äì1860) ****Johann Christoph Bach II (1645‚Äì1693) *****Johann Ernst Bach I (1683‚Äì1739) *****Johann Christoph Bach VII (1689‚Äì1740) ****Johann Ambrosius Bach (1645‚Äì1695) *****Johann Christoph Bach III (1671‚Äì1721) ******Johann Andreas Bach (1713‚Äì1779) *******Johann Christoph Georg Bach (1747‚Äì1814) ******Johann Bernhard Bach II (1700‚Äì1743) ******Johann Christoph Bach VIII (1702‚Äì1756) *******Ernst Carl Gottfried Bach (1738‚Äì1801) *******Ernst Christian Bach (1747‚Äì1822) *******Philipp Christian Georg Bach (1734‚Äì1809) *****Johann Jacob Bach III (1682‚Äì1722) *****Johann Sebastian Bach (1685‚Äì1750) ‚Äì wed in his first marriage to second cousin Maria Barbara Bach (1684‚Äì1720); in second marriage 1721 to Anna Magdalena Wilcke (1701‚Äì1760) ******Catharina Dorothea Bach (1708‚Äì1774) ******Wilhelm Friedemann Bach (1710‚Äì1784) ‚Äì the so- called \\"Dresden Bach\\" or \\"Halle Bach\\" ******Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach (1714‚Äì1788) ‚Äì the so-called \\"Hamburg Bach\\" or \\"Berlin Bach\\" *******Johann Sebastian Bach (1748‚Äì1778) ‚Äì painter ******Johann Gottfried Bernhard Bach (1715‚Äì1739) ******Gottfried Heinrich Bach (1724‚Äì1763) ******Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach (1732‚Äì1795) ‚Äì the so-called \\"B√ºckeburg Bach\\" *******Wilhelm Friedrich Ernst Bach (1759‚Äì1845) ‚Äì the so-called \\"Minden Bach\\" ******Johann Christian Bach III (1735‚Äì1782) ‚Äì the so-called \\"Milan Bach\\" or \\"London Bach\\" ***Heinrich Bach I (1615‚Äì1692) ‚Äì the so-called Arnstadt Line ****Johann Christoph Bach I (1642‚Äì1703) *****Johann Nikolaus Bach II (1669‚Äì1753) *****Johann Christoph Bach V (1676‚Äì) ******Johann Heinrich Bach II (1709‚Äì) *****Johann Friedrich Bach I (1682‚Äì1730) *****Johann Michael Bach II (1685‚Äì) ****Johann Michael Bach I (1648‚Äì1694) *****Maria Barbara Bach (1684‚Äì1720) ‚Äì married Johann Sebastian Bach (1685‚Äì1750) ****Johann G√ºnther Bach I (1653‚Äì1683) **Philippus \\"Lips\\" Bach (1590‚Äì1620) ‚Äì son of Veit Bach ***Wendel Bach (1619‚Äì1682) **** (1655‚Äì1718) *****Nicolaus Ephraim Bach (1690‚Äì1760) *****Georg Michael Bach (1703‚Äì1771) ******Johann Christian Bach IV (1743‚Äì1814) *****Johann Ludwig Bach (1677‚Äì1731) ‚Äì the so-called \\"Meininger Bach\\", composer ******Gottlieb Friedrich Bach (1714‚Äì1785) ‚Äì court organist, court painter Meinigen *******Johann Philipp Bach (1752‚Äì1846) ‚Äì musician, painter ******Samuel Anton Bach (1713‚Äì1781) ***Johann Bach IV (1621‚Äì1686) ‚Äì nephew of Lips Bach ****Johann Stephan Bach (1665‚Äì1717) *Caspar Bach I (1570‚Äì1640) (brother of Veit Bach?) **Caspar Bach II (1600‚Äì) **Heinrich \\"Blinder Jonas\\" Bach (‚àí1635) **Johann(es) Bach II (1612‚Äì1632) **Melchior Bach (1603‚Äì1634) **Nicolaus Bach (1619‚Äì1637) See also * P.

They are the main antagonists of the Justice Society of America. The Injustice Society first appears in All Star Comics #37 (Oct 1947) and was created by Sheldon Mayer and Bob Kanigher. The original group brought together six popular villains from Flash Comics, Green Lantern and All Star Comics: Thinker, Gambler, Vandal Savage, Wizard, Per Degaton and Brain Wave. The Injustice Society appear on the DC Universe streaming service show Stargirl as the main antagonists of the first season. The show also appears on The CW Network. The current members include the leader Icicle and members Brainwave, Tigress, Wizard, Sportsmaster, Dragon King, Gambler, Solomon Grundy, and the wife of the Fiddler. Fictional team history Golden Age =Wizard's Injustice Society= It is unknown under what circumstances the Injustice Society was formed. The group first appeared in the second half of the 1940s, led by the Wizard and planning to take over America. Fragmenting into individual efforts, the ISW launched strikes against government facilities around the nation, each with his own private army of convicts due to five jailbreaks engineered by the ISW. In addition to furthering their primary aims, the villains were each assigned to capture a member of the JSA in anticipated resistance. To ensure that the JSA showed up, the villains notified the heroes of their plans. In due course, Hawkman was captured by Vandal Savage at an airport which the criminal army had surrounded, and Doctor Mid-Nite was apprehended by Per Degaton who was attacking the Washington Monument. Flash fell victim to his long-time foe Thinker at the Governor's house where the Thinker was broadcasting fake demands by the Governor to make the armed forces stand down, due to invisible wires, and Atom was snared by Gambler. Green Lantern arrives in Uthorium Town just as the armed forces are closing in on the criminals that control the city. Suddenly, the town disappears in a flash of light. Green Lantern begins a search for the criminal army, when he discovers the town has re-appeared a few miles away, and the felons are looting uthorium from a lab. Green Lantern zooms in for the attack, when the Brainwave appears on the scene, opening a canister of uthorium in his presence. Blinded, Green Lantern forms an energy bubble for protection while Brainwave and his men finish their job. Recovering later. Green Lantern discovers a radioactive trail left behind by the uthorium and follows it, discovering some of the thugs with an invention called the \\"Mirage-Thrower,\\" which fools the Army tanks into crossing a frozen lake which really isn't frozen. Green Lantern saves the tanks and men, then follows the trail to discover Brainwave inside a weird glass box. Firing his power ring at it, the ray bounces back, knocking Green Lantern off a cliff, apparently to his death! Hearing of Per Degaton's capture of Doctor Mid-Nite in Capital City (evidently meant to be based on Washington), Wonder Woman and Johnny Thunder left the JSA HQ to intervene, only to be captured themselves. The JSA were held by a will-deadener beam, put on \\"trial\\" before Judge Thinker with the Wizard as Prosecutor, and sentenced to death, but it was then revealed Green Lantern had disguised himself as the Thinker. His ring saved him at the last moment and he captured the Thinker. He freed the others and they defeated the Injustice Society, with the Wizard being caught by the Junior Justice Society.All-Star Comics #37. DC Comics. =Second Injustice Society= The second formation appeared in the late 1940s attempting \\"patriotic crimes\\" where it was formed by Wizard and consisted of Fiddler, Harlequin, Huntress, Icicle, and Sportsmaster. They stole national monuments, hoping the American people would vote for the best crime allowing that person to become the leader, and succeeding in erasing the Society's memories after capturing them by the Sportsmaster knocking them out with one of his bombs, but Harlequin turned against them and with Black Canary restored the Justice Society's memories, though a post-hypnotic impulse restores the JSA to their mindless states when they hear fingers snapping, causing them to be recaptured. But their memories are restored again after they are placed in a death chamber, leading to Black Canary becoming a proper member.All-Star Comics #41. DC Comics. Silver Age The Injustice Society reforms during the 1970s to eliminate the reformed Justice Society. First, the Fiddler fetches Solomon Grundy and defeats Wildcat and Hawkman, but they are defeated by Kal-L and Power Girl.All-Star Comics #63 (1977). DC Comics.

Brainwave captures Green Lantern, Jay Garrick, and Power Girl before being defeated in Power Girl's first solo adventure.Showcase #97-99 (Feb-Apr. 1978). DC Comics. Post-Crisis =Injustice Unlimited= During what some described as the \\"anti-costumed-hero mania\\" (as chronicled in the DC mini-series Legends) in the pages of Infinity, Inc., the Wizard gathered both old comrades (consisting of Brainwave, Fiddler, Gambler, Harlequin, Per Degaton, Shade, Solomon Grundy, Sportsmaster, Thinker, and Vandal Savage) and new super-criminals (consisting of Hazard, Icicle II, and Tigress III) into a new Injustice Society which he called \\"Injustice Unlimited\\".Infinity, Inc. #32-37 (1987). DC Comics Indeed, the criminal group seemed to be a mirror image of Infinity, Inc., which itself was an offshoot of the Justice Society. Later, this team returned to the original name.Infinity Inc. #51-53 (1988). DC Comics. =Johnny Sorrow's Injustice Society= Johnny Sorrow appears in late 1999, as the leader of the new Injustice Society (consisting of the Icicle, Blackbriar Thorn, Count Vertigo, Geomancer, Killer Wasp, and Tigress). Together they storm the headquarters of superhero team Justice Society of America, although JSA member Wildcat defeats them all (destroying Blackbriar Thorn) despite still recovering from a broken arm and the attack initially being launched while he was in the bath, with the exception of Sorrow, who uses the diversion to steal an unknown artifact.JSA #9 - 10 (April - May 2000). DC Comics. Sorrow returns with a larger version of the Injustice Society (having also recruited Black Adam after removing a brain tumour, Shiv, Rival, and the Thinker A.I.) to distract the JSA while he summoned the King of Tears, an other-dimensional entity. However, the JSA were able to fend off the Society, including killing the Rival and Black Adam defecting, with the fight culminating in the Flash drawing on Black Adam's speed to send the King of Tears to another dimension by striking him at near- lightspeed. =Wizard's Second Injustice Society= The demon Legacy (actually Wizard in disguise) formed another version in the JSA All-Stars mini-series. The lineup consists of Icicle, Rival, Shiv, and Tigress. The new team again confronted the JSA. Unknown to the JSA, their job was just to stick teleportation disks to the old-timers.JSA All-Stars #1. DC Comics. Legacy then teleported his successful team away. Legacy is then later \\"killed\\" by the Spectre.JSA All-Stars #8. DC Comics. =Injustice Society= The Injustice Society resurfaced again in November 2005, in the pages of JSA Classified. The soul of Wizard joined forces with Johnny Sorrow where they gathered a new incarnation of the Injustice Society consisting of Gentleman Ghost, Icicle, Rag Doll, Solomon Grundy, the Thinker A.I., and Tigress III. They were tasked to steal Prometheus' Cosmic Key from the JSA Headquarters in order to free Wizard and Johnny Sorrow. While noting to himself that Rag Doll would betray the group, Wizard sets him up to take the fall.JSA Classified #5. DC Comics.

A Loyalist sympathizer, he operated from New York City after the war. His mansion in the city was used by President George Washington for several months in 1790 as the temporary president's mansion. Macomb had already made a fortune on land speculation in North Carolina, Georgia, and Kentucky, and believed he would make more profit in New York. But, unable to sell the New York land fast enough to meet his debts, he was sent to debtors' prison for a period and never regained his fortune. Early life and education Alexander Macomb was born in 1748 in Ballynure, a tiny rural village in County Antrim, northern Ireland to John Macomb, a merchant, and Jane Gordon, both of Scots-Irish descent.\\"William Macomb\\", Becoming Prominent: Regional Leadership in Upper Canada, 1791-1841, McGill- Queens University Press, 1989, p. 213 Alexander also had a younger brother William and sister. In 1755 the whole family moved to the New York colony, setting in Albany, a center of fur trading with the Iroquois and other Native American tribes.David B. Dill Jr. \\"Portrait of an Opportunist: The Life of Alexander Macomb\\", Watertown Daily Times, (September 9, 1990). First of a 3-part series Macomb and his brother William also became merchants and fur traders, operating around the Great Lakes as far west as Detroit, which had been under British control since 1763 and made into the British province of Quebec since 1774. Given their colonial settlement, French-Canadian traders were more numerous in the west, and competition was fierce. On August 27, 1774, Phyn & Ellice, fur traders in Schenectady in the Mohawk Valley, sold its Detroit stock to the Macomb brothers and appointed them as its agents in that post. This was a coup for 26-year-old Alexander and his younger brother. Career Alexander Macomb House in New York City served as the executive mansion for President George Washington, February‚ÄìAugust 1790. In Detroit, during the American Revolution, Macomb and his brother William continued their fur trade with British and Native Americans. They conducted a huge volume of business with the British government post at Detroit, supplying the militia as well as the colonial Indian Department. The brothers took a partner because of the volume of their business, and in fall 1781, invested 100,000 dollars in New York currency in the business. By 1785 Macomb returned to the East, settling in New York City; he followed his partner William Edgar, although they had dissolved the partnership. William Macomb stayed in Detroit, which was still under British rule. He later was elected to a term in the Upper Canada provincial assembly.David Dill, Jr., 'Macomb's Years In NY City Ones of Wealth and Power', Watertown Times, 16 September 1990 The city was rapidly rebuilding after the war, and men of Loyalist leanings, such as Macomb, were generally not discriminated against. They just wanted to get on with business. Macomb became a successful land speculator and shipping magnate in New York. He purchased large tracts of land in Georgia, Kentucky, and North Carolina for resale. In 1788, he built a four-story brick city mansion on Broadway one block south of Trinity Church; the house had a frontage along one side. In part Macomb needed the space for his large household; by 1790 he was a widower with 10 children at home. His household included 25 servants, among them 12 enslaved African Americans. Macomb was the third-largest slaveholder in the city, as by that time slaveholding residents generally owned only a few slaves as domestic servants or skilled labor. New York did not pass legislation for gradual abolition of slavery until the early 19th century. In 1790 the government of New York City leased Macomb's New York City house to serve as the second presidential mansion of the temporary capital, after the first, the Samuel Osgood House on Cherry Street, proved too small. George Washington occupied the Macomb mansion from February to August 1790. The mansion was later adapted as a landmark hotel. During this period, Macomb became active in civic affairs, using his expertise to purchase materials and direct the conversion of City Hall into Federal House for the temporary capital. He assisted the state legislature in supervising the construction of a building to house the state archives, and served two terms in the state assembly. Macomb also served as the first treasurer of \\"New York's first scientific body, the Society for the Promotion of Agriculture, Arts and Manufactures.\\" In July 1791, Alexander Macomb married again, to the young widow Mrs. John Peter Rucker, n√©e Jane Marshall. They had another seven children together. That year he purchased his largest tract of land of all, from the State of New York: 3,670,715 acres (14,855 km¬≤), which has since known as \\"Macomb's Purchase.\\" The tract included much of northern New York, along the St. Lawrence River and eastern Lake Ontario, including the Thousand Islands, and he paid about twelve cents an acre. The state took control of this land after the British ceded their own and Iroquois lands to the United States under terms of the treaty at the end of the war. Four of the six Iroquois tribes had been allied with the British but none was consulted during the treaty negotiations. The state's treaty and sale of this land was never ratified by the US Senate. (Note: In the late 20th century, some of the tribes filed land claims for compensation, claiming that New York state did not have the authority to treat with them, and the land cessions were never ratified by the US Senate. Some of the land claims were upheld by the US Supreme Court.) The purchase was divided into ten large townships. From this purchase are derived the deeds for all the lands that are now included in Lewis, Jefferson, St. Lawrence, and Franklin counties, as well as portions of Herkimer and Oswego counties. Contrary to his expectations, Macomb's enterprise was a failure. Sales of land did not keep pace with the due dates for payments. During the Panic of 1792, which further depressed land sales, Macomb was taken to debtor's prison with over $300,000 in debt. He never regained his fortune. As economic conditions improved, some land speculators later made huge amounts of money from their turnover of New York lands. Marriage and family Macomb's granddaughter, Catherine Navarre Macomb, who married Oswald John Cammann, by Thomas Seir Cummings (ca. 1843) Portrait of the subject's son and namesake, Major General Alexander Macomb (1782-1841). On May 4, 1773, Macomb married Mary Catherine Navarre, daughter of Robert de Navarre, the subd√©l√©g√© of Detroit under the French.Collections - State Historical Society of Wisconsin, Lyman Copeland Draper, State Historical Society of Wisconsin, 1879 They had a large family. His namesake son Major General Alexander Macomb (1782‚Äì1841)Although this son was named after his father, he was not called junior (Jr.), nor was Alexander Macomb the elder called senior (Sr.) They are both known as Alexander Macomb, and neither name is followed by a designation. Richards, p. 14. had an illustrious military career, winning the Battle of Plattsburgh and serving as Commanding General of the United States Army from May 29, 1828, to June 25, 1841. He and five other Macomb sons served in the military during the War of 1812. Their daughter Jane Macomb married Hon. Robert Kennedy, a Scotsman who was brother of the Marquess of Ailsa.The Peerage of the British Empire as at Present Existing, Edmund Lodge, Anne Innes, Saunders & Otley, London, 1851 The Kennedys' daughter Sophia-Eliza married John Levett of Wychnor Park, Staffordshire, England.Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry, John Burke, H.

John Navarre Macomb's children included Colonel John Navarre Macomb, Jr. (1811-1899). Macomb Jr's children included Montgomery M. Macomb (1852-1924), a career United States Army officer who attained the rank of Brigadier General. When his wife Mary died in 1790, Macomb had 10 children living at home. The next year he married Janet Marshall Rucker, herself a widow.Saint-M√©min and the Neoclassical Profile Portrait in America, Ellen G. Miles, National Portrait Gallery and the Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington, 1994.Five Generations: Life and Letters of an American Family, 1750-1900, Margaret Armstrong, Harper & Brothers, New York, 1930. They had seven more children, including Elizabeth Maria Macomb (born 7 Jan 1795), who married Thomas Hunt Flandrau, the law partner of Aaron Burr.Brown, John Howard (1904). The Twentieth Century Biographical Dictionary of Notable Americans. Boston, Biographical Society. Volume IV, F The Flandraus' eldest son was Charles Eugene Flandrau (1808-1903), a Minnesota political and judicial figure. He was the grandfather of Isabella Greenway (1886-1953), U.S Representative from Arizona. Alexander Macomb died in the District of Columbia in 1831. Further reading * David B.

His third book about the war, it is based upon his experiences as a soldier in the 23rd Infantry Division. O'Brien generally refrains from political debate and discourse regarding the Vietnam War. He was dismayed that people in his home town seemed to have so little understanding of the war and its world. It was in part a response to what he considered ignorance that he wrote The Things They Carried.Herzog, Toby C., \\"Tim O'Brien,\\" New York: Twayne Publishers, 1997. It was published by Houghton Mifflin in 1990. Many of the characters are semi-autobiographical, sharing similarities with figures from his memoir If I Die in a Combat Zone, Box Me Up and Ship Me Home (1973/paperback 1999). In The Things They Carried, O'Brien plays with the genre of metafiction; he writes using verisimilitude. His use of real place names and inclusion of himself as the protagonist blurs fiction and non-fiction. As part of this effect, O'Brien dedicates The Things They Carried to the fictional men of the \\"Alpha Company,\\" contributing to the novel appearing to be a war memoir. Plot summaries ;\\"The Things They Carried\\": Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, the leader of a platoon of soldiers in Vietnam, carries physical reminders of Martha, the object of his unrequited love. Thoughts of Martha often distract Lieutenant Cross from his team's objectives. A death in the squad under his supervision causes Cross to reconsider his priorities, as he was heartbroken, he burns and throws away all reminders of Martha in order to focus on the mission and avoid distractions. ;\\"Love\\": Cross and O'Brien reminisce about the war and about Martha. O'Brien asks if he can write a story about Cross, expressing his memories and hopes for the future; Cross agrees, thinking that perhaps Martha will read it and come find him. ;\\"Spin\\": A series of unrelated memories from the war are narrated from O'Brien's point of view. It includes moments of camaraderie and beauty: a joke of a hate letter to the Draft Board; learning a rain dance between battles. ;\\"On the Rainy River\\": O'Brien gets drafted as soon as he graduates from college. He is reluctant to go to war and considers fleeing the draft; he begins to travel north to the Canada‚ÄìUS border on the Rainy River. Near the border, he encounters an elderly stranger who allows him to work through his internal struggle. O'Brien is given the opportunity to escape; however, the societal pressures are too much for him. He goes to war ashamed with his inability to face the consequences of leaving. ;\\"Enemies and Friends\\" Told in two sections, the developing relationship between soldiers Jensen and Strunk is shown. At first regularly antagonized by one another, the two are drawn toward respect and friendship by the stress and horrors of warfare. Ultimately, they agree that if one should be wounded, the other must deal a fatal blow as a form of mercy. ;\\"How to Tell a True War Story\\": O'Brien explores the telling of war stories by comrades, revealing that truth is delicate and malleable. Anything can be faked ... but generally, only the worst events can be proven real. He concludes that, in the end, the truth of a story doesn't matter so much as what the story is trying to say. ;\\"The Dentist\\": In order to mourn Curt Lemon, a man O'Brien did not know well, he shares a brief recollection about a bizarre interaction between Lemon and an army dentist. Lemon, who is afraid of dentists, faints before the dentist can examine him. Later that night, however, he complains of a phantom tooth ache so severe a tooth is pulled - even though it's perfectly healthy. Lemon has felt he needs to prove himself in front of his men and be the fearless man all soldiers are supposed to be. ;\\"Sweetheart of the Song Tra Bong\\": O'Brien recounts the legendary (and almost certainly exaggerated) tale of Rat Kiley's first assignment, near the Song Tra Bong river. The area is so isolated that one of the soldiers flies his hometown girlfriend in by helicopter. At first, she cooks, cleans, and tends to the soldiers' wounds ... but gradually, she assimilates into Vietnamese guerrilla culture, even wearing a necklace made of human tongues, and disappears into the jungle. ;\\"Stockings\\": O'Brien explains how Henry Dobbins wore the stockings of his girlfriend around his neck to bed, and sometimes to battle. Even when the girlfriend breaks things off, he keeps the stockings around his neck, as their powers have been demonstrated. ;\\"Church\\": The platoon discovers an abandoned building being used as a sort of church, inhabited by monks who bring them food and supplies. The men discuss their relationships with churches, and for the most part, appreciate the interaction with other people and the peace of the building. Henry Dobbins wants to become a priest, but decides otherwise. ;\\"The Man I Killed\\": O'Brien describes a man he killed in My Khe, and how he did it. He makes up a life story for the man, torturing himself with the idea that the victim had been a gentle soul. ;\\"Ambush\\": O'Brien's daughter asks if he killed anyone in the war; he lies to her that he did not. He then tells the story of an ambush outside My Khe, in which O'Brien kills a young man who may or may not have wanted to harm him. ;\\"Style\\" The platoon witnesses a young Vietnamese girl dancing through the burned remains of her village, and argue over whether it's a ritual or simply what she likes to do. Later, Azar mocks the girl, and Dobbins rebukes him. ;\\"Speaking of Courage\\": After his service, Norman Bowker is at a loss. His former girlfriend has married someone else, his closest friends are dead. He reflects on the medals he won in Vietnam, and imagines telling his father about both these and the medals he did not win. Ultimately, although he has no one to share these memories with, he finds catharsis in imagined conversations. ;\\"Notes\\": O'Brien says that Bowker asked him to write the previous story, and that he hanged himself three years later unable to regain his footing and find any meaning in life after the war. O'Brien muses over the suspicion that, without Harvard and writing, he too might have lost the will to live after returning from Vietnam. ;\\"In the Field\\": When Kiowa is killed on the banks of a river, during a mission led by Jimmy Cross, Cross takes responsibility for his death. He writes to Kiowa's father while the others search for the body - as usual, Azar jokes around at first. Another soldier also feels responsible for the death, as he did not save Kiowa; the story ends with the body being found in the mud, and both soldiers left to their guilt. ;\\"Good Form\\": O'Brien reiterates that the real truth does not have to be the same as the story truth, and that it is the emotions evoked by the story that matter. He says that his story about killing a man on the trail outside My Khe was false; he merely saw the man die. But he wanted to provoke the same feelings in the reader that he felt on the trail. ;\\"Field Trip\\": After finishing the story, \\"In the Field,\\" O'Brien says, he and his ten-year- old daughter visit the site of Kiowa's death with an interpreter. The field looks different from his memory of it, but he leaves a pair of Kiowa's moccasins in the spot where he believes Kiowa sank. In this way, he comes to terms with his friend's death. ;\\"The Ghost Soldiers\\": O'Brien recounts the two times he was wounded. The first time, he is treated by Rat Kiley, and is impressed with the man's courage and skill. The second time, he is treated by Kiley's replacement, Bobby Jorgenson; Jorgenson is incompetent, and nearly kills O'Brien. Furious, O'Brien promises revenge, but can recruit only Azar. They scare Jorgenson by pretending to be enemy soldiers, but the soldier proves that he is not a coward, so O'Brien lets go of his resentment. ;\\"Night Life\\": O'Brien tells the second-hand account of Rat Kiley's injury: warned of a possible attack, the platoon is on edge. Kiley reacts by distancing himself, the stress causing him first to be silent for days on end, and then to talk constantly. He has a breakdown from the pressure of being a medic, and shoots himself in the toe in order to get released from combat. No one questions his bravery. ;\\"The Lives of the Dead\\": O'Brien remembers his very first encounter with a dead body, that of his childhood sweetheart Linda. Suffering from a brain tumor, Linda died at the age of nine and O'Brien was deeply affected by her funeral. In Vietnam, O'Brien explains, the soldiers keep the dead alive by telling stories about them; in this way, he keeps Linda alive by telling her story.The thought and presence of death has shown to have a large effect on O'Brien. Characters Main Characters ;Tim O'Brien: The narrator and the protagonist. While modeled after the author and sharing the same name, O'Brien (within the book) is a fictional character. The author intentionally blurs this distinction. ;Lt. Jimmy Cross: The platoon leader, who is obsessed with a young woman back home, Martha (who does not return his feelings). He later believes that his obsession led to the death of Ted Lavender. ;Bob \\"Rat\\" Kiley: A young medic whose exaggerations are complemented by his occasional cruelty. Eventually, he sees too much gore and begins to break down, imagining \\"the bugs are out to get [him].\\" ;Norman Bowker: A soldier who O'Brien says attempted to save Kiowa the night he died. When Kiowa slips into the \\"shitfield\\", Bowker repeatedly tries to save him but is unable to; as a result, he feels guilty for Kiowa's death after the war. His memories continue to haunt Norman at home as he realizes that the world has moved on from the war, and wants nothing to do with the \\"hell\\" in Vietnam. He is continually haunted by the fact that he could not save Kiowa from sinking under the \\"shitfield\\" on a rainy night. However, O'Brien admits eventually that Norman did not fail to save Kiowa, that was fictional. After the war he briefly assists O'Brien in writing a story about Vietnam, but he hangs himself with a jump rope in an Iowa YMCA facility, leaving no note and his family shocked. ;Henry Dobbins: Machine gunner. A man who, despite having a rather large frame, is gentle and kind. He is very superstitious; as a result, he wears his girlfriend's pantyhose around his neck as a protective \\"charm\\", even after she dumps him. He briefly contemplates becoming a monk after the war due to their acts of charity. ;Kiowa: A compassionate and talkative soldier; he demonstrates the importance of talking about one's problems and traumatic experiences. He is also a devout Baptist and a Native American that occasionally feels contempt and distrust towards white people. However, he appears to be Tim O'Brien's best friend in the company. Kiowa often helps other soldiers deal with their own actions, such as taking the lives of other human beings. He is eventually killed when camping out in the \\"shitfield.\\" ;Mitchell Sanders: He is the radiotelephone operator for the platoon. Like O'Brien, he is also a storyteller and is portrayed as a mentor. ;Ted Lavender: A grenadier. He dies from a gunshot wound to the back of the head. He is notorious for using tranquilizers to cope with the pain of war, and for carrying a (rather large--six to eight ounces) stash of \\"premium dope\\" with him. Cross blames himself for Lavender's death, as he was fantasizing about Martha when Lavender was shot. ;Curt Lemon: A young man who frequently attempts to assume the role as a tough soldier. However, he is also good friend of Rat Kiley. Lemon dies after setting off a rigged artillery shell. In one of the book's more disturbing scenes, O'Brien and Dave Jensen help clear the trees of Curt's scattered remains, during which Jensen sings \\"Lemon Tree\\" (something that \\"wakes [Tim] up\\"). After Lemon dies, Kiley writes a long, eloquent letter to Lemon's sister, describing his friendship with Lemon and emphasizing how good a person Lemon was; Lemon's sister never responds, which crushes Kiley emotionally. ;Azar: A young, rather unstable soldier who engages in needless and frequent acts of brutality. In one story, he blows up an orphan puppy that Ted Lavender had adopted by strapping it to a Claymore mine, then detonating it. He also aids Tim O'Brien in gaining revenge on Bobby Jorgenson, but mocks O'Brien when he's not willing to take the revenge further. At one point, Azar breaks down emotionally, revealing that his cruelty is merely a defense mechanism. ;Dave Jensen and Lee Strunk: Minor soldiers who are the main characters of \\"Enemies\\" and \\"Friends\\". Jensen fights with Strunk over a stolen jackknife, but they became uneasy friends afterwards. They each sign a pact to kill the other if he is ever faced with a \\"wheelchair wound\\". After Strunk steps on a rigged mortar round and loses a leg, he begs Jensen not to kill him. Jensen obliges, but seems to have an enormous weight relieved when he learns \\"Strunk died somewhere over in Chu Lai\\". Jensen is sometimes mentioned singing \\"Lemon Tree\\" after Curt Lemon's abrupt death. Jensen also appears in \\"The Lives of the Dead\\", where he pressures O'Brien to shake hands with a dead Vietnamese. ;Bobby Jorgenson: Rat Kiley's replacement, after Rat \\"put a round through his foot\\" due to breaking under pressure. Green and terrified, he is slow to aid O'Brien when he is shot in the behind. Jorgenson nearly kills O'Brien after failing to treat him for shock. Filled with rage after his recovery, O'Brien elicits help from Azar to conspire and punish Jorgenson with a night of terrifying pranks. Later, O'Brien and Jorgenson become friends. Jorgenson may be a reference to a similarly-named character from The Caine Mutiny. Themes Genre The Things They Carried is a war novel. Literary Critic David Wyatt points out that O'Brien's novel is similar the works of Wilfred Owen, Stephen Crane, George Orwell, and Ernest Hemingway. O‚ÄôBrien utilizes a style of writing that combines both fiction and nonfiction together into one piece. When asked to describe how he blurs this line between the two genres, O‚ÄôBrien says \\"I set out to write a book with the feel of utter and absolute reality, a work of fiction that would read like nonfiction and adhere to the conventions of a memoir: dedicating the book to the characters, using my name, drawing on my own life. This was a technical challenge. My goal was to compose a fiction with the texture, sound and authentic-seeming weight of nonfiction.\\" Truth vs Reality Another theme that is highlighted in the short story \\"Good Form,\\" is when the narrator makes a distinction between \\"story truth\\" and \\"happening truth.\\" O‚ÄôBrien talks about truth and reality in relation to the story by describing, \\"I can say that the book‚Äôs form is intimately connected to how I, as a human being, tend to view the world unfolding itself around me. It‚Äôs sometimes difficult to separate external 'reality' from the internal processing of that reality.\\" O'Brien's fluid and elliptical negotiation of truth in this context finds echoes in works labeled as 'non-fiction novels'. Imagination/Comedy Another important theme O'Brien highlights is the emphasis on imagination and pretending. He says that this theme, \\"That‚Äôs an important part of my work. I‚Äôm a believer in the power of the imagination in ordinary human lives, and it‚Äôs much more important that we often credit.\\" O'Brien goes on to say, \\"And that is, I think, key to why I‚Äôm a fiction writer. If that element were not present, I‚Äôd be doing nonfiction. Or I wouldn‚Äôt be a writer at all.\\" Tim O'Brien also alludes to the difficulty in using dark comedy as a theme by say, \\"My guess is that I‚Äôll be remembered, if I‚Äôm remembered at all, for my so-called tragedies: The Things They Carried, Going After Cacciato, If I Die in a Combat Zone and In the Lake of the Woods. Personally, I consider Tomcat in Love, if not my best book, certainly up there among the best. Yet I realize the most ‚Äúliterary‚Äù folks will disagree. In the end, it‚Äôs a matter of taste, I suppose. My sense of humor, which tends toward the outrageous, is plainly not for everyone.\\" Morality O‚ÄôBrien also shows the constant struggle of morality throughout the story during the Vietnam War. A paper from Brigham Young University highlights the conflict that soldiers face when transitioning from civilian life to soldier life in relation to morality. It states, ‚ÄúAs demonstrated through the soldiers‚Äô experiences with pleasure, the soldiers‚Äô moral code must change from that of their civilian lives in order for them to find moral justification in the everyday violence war requires.‚ÄùBonney, Sarah. Morality and Pleasure in Tim O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs The Things They Carried. p. 11. The paper goes on to acknowledge that, ‚ÄúIn O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs The Things They Carried, the concept of morality is complicated by the treatment of violence and a connection between violence and pleasure; resultantly, morality must be defined on a spectrum rather than a binary scale.‚ÄùBonney, Sarah. Morality and Pleasure in Tim O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs The Things They Carried. p. 11. Belief Additionally, the character Tim references writing the book Going After Cacciato which the author Tim had written and published previously. The theme of believing in the people around you and having reliable people with you comes from the time period being filled with people who are opposed to the action of war. This causes the people who are drafted into the mutual hate to band together to live.McCoy, Erin R. \\"Stalemate Or Cultural Crossroad?: Exploring U.S. \\"Systems\\" During The Vietnam War.\\" Interdisciplinary Humanities 30.2 (2013): Adaptations ;Film The story \\"Sweetheart of the Song Tra Bong\\" was made into a film in 1998, titled A Soldier's Sweetheart starring Kiefer Sutherland.

The production was selected as an alternate for KCACTF Region VII, as well as receiving other KCACTF honors for the production's director, actors, and production staff. Music The band TV Girl features a song off their 2014 album 'French Exit' called 'Pantyhose'. The song alludes to the \\"Stockings\\" chapter from the book and references Henry Dobbins and his girlfriend's stockings, which he ties around his neck to keep him from harm. Lyrics such as,\\"And when the bullets came, he didn't duck; He wrapped her pantyhose around his neck; And he could feel their magic working; Keeping him from harm; Away to some place mystical and warm; His lucky charm\\" clearly references to Dobbins and his tactic that the scent of his girlfriend's stockings protect him and take him some place far from Vietnam. Publication Before the book's publication in 1990, five of the stories: \\"The Things They Carried,\\" \\"How to Tell a True War Story,\\" \\"Sweetheart of the Song Tra Bong,\\" \\"The Ghost Soldiers,\\" and \\"The Lives of the Dead\\" were published in Esquire. \\"Speaking of Courage\\" was originally published (in heavily modified form) as a chapter of O'Brien's earlier novel Going After Cacciato. \\"The Things They Carried\\" was also included in the 1987 volume of The Best American Short Stories, edited by Ann Beattie and the second edition of Literature: Approaches to Fiction, Poetry, and Drama by Robert DiYanni. Reception The Things They Carried has received critical acclaim and has been established as one of the preeminent pieces of Vietnam War literature. It has sold over 2 million copies worldwideKurutz, Steven, \\"A War Book's Long Shelf Life,\\" Wall Street Journal, March 19, 2010. and celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2010. It has received multiple awards such as France's Prix du Meilleur Livre Etranger Award and the Chicago Tribune Heartland Prize, as well as being a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Critics Circle Award. O'Brien has expressed surprise at how the book has become a staple in middle schools and high schools, stating that he \\"certainly hadn't imagined fourteen year-old kids and eighteen year-olds and those even in their early twenties reading the book and bringing such fervor to it, which comes from their own lives, really. The book is applied to a bad childhood or a broken home, and these are the things they're carrying. And in a way, it's extremely flattering, and other times, it can be depressing.\\" In 2014, the book was included in Amazon.com's list of 100 Books to Read in a Lifetime and credited as the inspiration for a National Veterans Art Museum exhibit.

R. Martin. It was first published on August 8, 2000, in the United Kingdom, with a United States edition following in November 2000. Its publication was preceded by a novella called Path of the Dragon, which collects some of the Daenerys Targaryen chapters from the novel into a single book. At the time of its publication, A Storm of Swords was the longest novel in the series. It was so long that in the UK, Ireland, Australia, Serbia and Israel, its paperback edition was split in half, Part 1 being published as Steel and Snow in June 2001 (with the one- volume cover) and Part 2 as Blood and Gold in August 2001 (with a specially- commissioned new cover). The same division was used in the Polish and Greek editions. In France, the decision was made to cut the novel into four separate volumes. A Storm of Swords won the 2001 Locus Award, the 2002 Geffen Award for Best Novel and was nominated for the 2001 Nebula Award for Best Novel. It was the first novel in the series to be nominated for the Hugo Award, one of the two most prestigious awards in science fiction and fantasy publishing, although it lost to J. K. Rowling's novel Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Meisha Merlin Publishing, which had previously issued limited, illustrated editions of both A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings, was planning to release a similar version for A Storm of Swords in two volumes; however, lengthy delays in the release of A Clash of Kings caused it to lose its publishing rights, which were picked up by Subterranean Press. This edition, illustrated by Charles Vess, was released in the summer of 2006. A Storm of Swords is also the name of the second expansion to the board game A Game of Thrones, released in July 2006. Approximately the first half of the novel was adapted for television as the third season of the HBO show Game of Thrones, while the second half became the basis for the series' fourth season, and some elements for the series' fifth season. Plot summary A Storm of Swords picks up the story slightly before the end of its predecessor, A Clash of Kings. The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros are still in the grip of the War of the Five Kings,War of the Five Kings at A Wiki of Ice and Fire westeros.org, Retrieved 25 December 2014 wherein Joffrey Baratheon and his uncle Stannis Baratheon compete for the Iron Throne, while Robb Stark of the North and Balon Greyjoy of the Iron Islands declare their independence (Stannis's brother Renly Baratheon, the fifth \\"king\\", has already been killed). Meanwhile, a large host of wildlings, the tribes from beyond the Seven Kingdoms' northern border, approach the Wall that marks the border, under the leadership of Mance Rayder, the self-proclaimed \\"King Beyond the Wall\\", with only the undermanned Night's Watch in opposition. Finally, Daenerys Targaryen, the daughter of a deposed former king of Westeros and \\"mother\\" of the world's only living dragons, sails west, planning to retake her late father's throne. In the Seven Kingdoms =The Riverlands= At her father's castle of Riverrun, Robb's mother Catelyn Stark releases the captive Jaime Lannister, Joffrey's uncle (and, secretly, father) in order to secure the release of Catelyn's daughters, Sansa and Arya, who Catelyn believes are held hostage by the Lannisters in the capital city, King's Landing. Jaime is sent south, escorted by Brienne of Tarth. Robb's army returns to Riverrun, having vanquished the Lannister armies in the west, and Robb reveals that he has married Jeyne Westerling, violating his promise to be wed to a daughter of House Frey. These actions alienate and infuriate some of Robb's allies, weakening his military position. Jaime and Brienne are captured by mercenaries working for Roose Bolton, who is nominally an ally of Robb's but is secretly plotting to undermine him to become Warden of the North. The mercenary captain Vargo Hoat has Jaime's sword hand cut off. Brienne is thrown into a bear pit by Hoat, and Jaime risks his own life to rescue her. Bolton releases Jaime and Brienne and they travel to King's Landing. Arya Stark, traveling in the Riverlands, is taken in by the \\"Brotherhood Without Banners\\": a band that defends the smallfolk of the Riverlands, led by Lord Beric Dondarrion and the red priest Thoros of Myr. The group captures Sandor \\"The Hound\\" Clegane, Joffrey's former bodyguard, and offers him trial by combat for his crimes. The Hound kills Beric, but Thoros resurrects him with the power of the fire god R'hllor. The Hound kidnaps Arya and flees with her, planning to ransom her. In order to return north to defend the region against Greyjoy attacks, Robb needs the support of the Freys. The Freys propose a wedding between Catelyn's brother Edmure Tully, now lord of the Riverlands, and one of Lord Walder Frey's daughters, to compensate for Robb breaking his marriage agreement. At the wedding celebration, the Boltons and Freys turn on the Starks, massacring Robb's bannermen. Robb is murdered by Roose Bolton, while Catelyn's throat is cut and her body thrown into the river; Edmure is kept alive as a hostage. These events become known as the Red Wedding. Arya and the Hound witness the massacre and escape. Later, the Hound is wounded in a skirmish, and Arya abandons him. She takes a ship to the Free City of Braavos, where the assassin Jaqen H'ghar had told her she could find him. In the epilogue, a re-animated but decayed and mutilated Catelyn is leading the Brotherhood Without Banners, and she oversees the lynching of two of the Freys who were present at the Red Wedding. =King's Landing, Dragonstone, and the Eyrie= The smuggler- turned-knight Davos Seaworth attempts to assassinate Stannis' advisor Melisandre, a sorceress and priestess of R'hllor, blaming her for Stannis' defeat in his prior assault on King's Landing. Davos is imprisoned for treason, but at Melisandre's behest, Stannis releases Davos and appoints him Hand of the King. Melisandre uses the blood of Edric Storm, a bastard son of Stannis' late brother King Robert, to curse the three rival Kings. Balon Greyjoy's death is reported shortly thereafter. King's Landing welcomes the Lannisters' new allies, the Tyrells, as liberators, and King Joffrey sets aside his betrothal to Sansa Stark in favor of Margaery Tyrell. Joffrey's grandfather Tywin Lannister, the Hand of the King, compels Sansa to marry his dwarf son Tyrion, to enable Lannister control of the North; but Tyrion refuses to consummate the marriage against her will. Margaery and Joffrey's wedding is held as planned, but during the wedding feast, Joffrey is poisoned and dies. Tyrion is accused of the murder by his sister Cersei, Joffrey's mother, and arrested. Sansa escapes the castle with the help of Lord Petyr \\"Littlefinger\\" Baelish, who admits to her his culpability in Joffrey's death, incriminating Margaery's grandmother Olenna as well. Littlefinger and Sansa depart King's Landing for the Eyrie, home of Catelyn's sister Lysa Arryn. After Balon, Robb and Joffrey die, as Melisandre predicted, Davos has Edric smuggled to safety to prevent Melisandre and Stannis sacrificing him for the power in his blood. Davos discovers a request by the Night's Watch for aid against Mance Rayder; Stannis prepares to execute Davos for treason but changes his mind after Davos shows Stannis the Night's Watch's plea. The spymaster Varys and Tyrion's lover Shae testify falsely against Tyrion at his trial. Prince Oberyn Martell, of the southern region of Dorne, offers to represent Tyrion in a trial by combat against Cersei's champion, Gregor Clegane, who was responsible for the death of Oberyn's sister Elia. Oberyn nearly wins, but is ultimately killed by Gregor, although the poison on Oberyn's spear leaves Gregor dying in agony. Tyrion is sentenced to death. Upon returning to King's Landing, Jaime gives Brienne a sword reforged from the hereditary sword of the Stark family, and sends her to find Arya and Sansa and return them home. Jaime refuses to believe that Tyrion killed Joffrey, and helps Varys free Tyrion from prison. Jaime reveals that Tyrion's first wife Tysha, whom Tywin had gang-raped by his garrison, was not a prostitute as Tywin told him, and genuinely loved Tyrion. Outraged, Tyrion swears revenge on Jaime, Cersei, and Tywin; during his escape, he murders both Shae and Tywin before fleeing Westeros. At the Eyrie, Sansa is disguised as an illegitimate daughter of Littlefinger, and Littlefinger and Lysa are married. Lysa reveals that Littlefinger had convinced her to poison her late husband Jon, and to pin the blame on the Lannisters, which was the catalyst for the events of A Game of Thrones. Lysa threatens to kill Sansa, thinking she is trying to seduce Littlefinger, but Littlefinger intervenes and, after revealing that he had only ever loved Catelyn, pushes Lysa to her death. The North The detachment of the Night's Watch under Lord Commander Jeor Mormont are attacked by undead wights and the Others, hostile inhuman creatures from the far north. The Watch suffer heavy casualties, although the steward Samwell Tarly kills one of the Others with a blade of obsidian. Soon some of the Watch mutiny and kill Mormont, but Sam escapes with the help of a wildling girl, Gilly. Sam, Gilly, and Gilly's newborn child approach the Wall, assisted by a strange figure riding an elk, whom Sam calls Coldhands. Among the dead are most of the Watch's senior leadership. Robb's brother Bran and his friends, having escaped the Boltons' attack on the Stark castle Winterfell, are guided north by Bran's dreams of a three-eyed crow. At the Wall, Sam guides them to Coldhands and returns to the Night Watch's headquarters at Castle Black, having sworn to keep Bran's survival secret even from Jon Snow, Bran's bastard brother and Sam's fellow Watchman. Jon, on a mission to infiltrate the wildlings, convinces Mance that he is a deserter from the Night's Watch, and learns that the Others are driving the wildlings south towards the Wall. Jon and his captor Ygritte also begin a sexual relationship. After crossing the Wall, Jon escapes the wildlings and returns to Castle Black. The approaching wildling army attacks Castle Black; but Jon takes command of the defenses and repels several assaults, during which Ygritte is slain. After that, the Watch's surviving leaders Janos Slynt and Alliser Thorne falsely accuse Jon of treachery, and send him north of the Wall to kill Mance under a pretense of parley. As Jon is talking with Mance in the wildling camp, Stannis' army arrives, routing the Wildlings, and Mance is imprisoned. Stannis offers to legitimize Jon and make him Lord of Winterfell in exchange for his support, but Jon decides to decline Stannis' offer, and is elected by the Night's Watch as its new Lord Commander. Slaver's Bay Daenerys Targaryen learns that large slave armies can be bought in Astapor, one of the cities of Slaver's Bay, and buys the entire host of the warrior-eunuch Unsullied by offering one of her infant dragons in exchange. Upon payment, Daenerys orders the Unsullied and the dragon to turn on the slave traders and sack the city. With the help of her maturing dragons, she frees all the slaves of Astapor, including the Unsullied. Daenerys' army then conquers the slaver city of Yunkai; but the lords of the neighbouring city of Meereen antagonize Daenerys by killing child slaves and burning the land to deny her resources. Consequently, Daenerys besieges the city to no avail. Daenerys discovers two traitors in her camp: Ser Jorah Mormont, who had spied on her for the late King Robert, and Ser Barristan Selmy, the humiliated former Lord Commander of King Robert's Kingsguard. Daenerys offers both men the chance to make amends by sneaking into Meereen to free the slaves and start an uprising. Meereen soon falls and, in retaliation for the murdered child slaves, Daenerys has the city's rulers put to death. Selmy asks for Daenerys' forgiveness and becomes Lord Commander of her Queensguard, while Jorah, who refuses to admit any wrongdoing, is banished. When Daenerys learns that the council she left to govern Astapor has been overthrown, she decides to remain in Meereen to rule it herself.

Development On October 6, 2009, Martin noted on his blog that his manuscript for A Storm of Swords had been 1521 pages in length; the initial printed hardcover came in at 992 pages. Martin did not write the Red Wedding chapters until he had completed every other chapter of the book, as he felt it was \\"the hardest thing I ever wrote\\" and that he would rather delay writing until absolutely necessary. In contrast, he referred to the chapter of Joffrey's fatal wedding as \\"easy and fun to write\\" but that he nevertheless tried to instill empathy for the painful demise of this very unpopular character and \\"bring home the point that this, too, was a human being who was scared and terrified and then dead\\".George R.

(\\"Game of Thrones 3A: Return of the Others\\", \\"Game of Thrones 3B: Tears of Direwolf\\", \\"Game of Thrones 3C: Purple Wedding\\") Reception Publishers Weekly said the third volume was \\"one of the more rewarding examples of gigantism in contemporary fantasy. [...] The complexity of characters such as Daenerys, Arya and the Kingslayer will keep readers turning even the vast number of pages contained in this volume, for the author, like Tolkien or Jordan, makes us care about their fates. Those two fantasy greats are also evoked by Martin's ability to convey such sensual experiences as the heat of wildfire, the chill of ice, the smell of the sea and the sheer gargantuan indigestibility of the medieval banquet at its most excessive. Perhaps this saga doesn't go as far beyond the previous bounds of high fantasy as some claim, but for most readers it certainly goes far enough to command their attention.\\" Martin was nominated for the 2001 Hugo Award for Best Novel, but lost to J. K. Rowling for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Afterwards he made this comment about his fans: \\"Eat your heart out, Rowling.

Bread supposedly provides the yeast for the pruno to ferment. Pruno originated in (and remains largely confined to) prisons, where it can be produced with the limited selection of equipment and ingredients available to inmates. The concoction can be made using only a plastic bag, hot running water, and a towel or sock to conceal the pulp during fermentation. The end result has been colorfully described as a \\"bile flavored wine-cooler\\",. Depending on the time spent fermenting (always balanced against the risk of discovery by officers), the sugar content, and the quality of the ingredients and preparation, pruno's alcohol content by volume can range from as low as 2% (equivalent to a very weak beer) to as high as 14% (equivalent to a strong wine). Description Typically, the fermenting mass of fruit‚Äîcalled the motor or kicker in prison parlance‚Äîis retained from batch to batch to make the fermentation start faster. The more sugar that is added, the greater the potential for a higher alcohol content‚Äîto a point. Beyond this point, the waste products of fermentation (mainly alcohol) cause the motor to die or go dormant as the yeasts' environment becomes too poisoned for them to continue fermenting. This also causes the taste of the end product to suffer. Ascorbic acid powder is sometimes used to stop the fermentation at a certain point, which, combined with the tartness of the added acid, somewhat enhances the taste by reducing the cloyingly sweet flavor associated with pruno. In 2004 and 2005 botulism outbreaks were reported among inmates in two California prisons; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suspects that potatoes used in making pruno were to blame in both cases. In 2012, similar botulism outbreaks caused by potato-based pruno were reported among inmates at prisons in Arizona and Utah. Inmates are not permitted to have alcoholic beverages, and correctional officers confiscate pruno whenever and wherever they find it. In an effort to eradicate pruno, some wardens have gone as far as banning all fresh fruit, fruit juices, and fruit-based food products from prison cafeterias. But even this is not always enough; there are pruno varieties made almost entirely from sauerkraut and orange juice. Food hoarding in the inmate cells in both prisons and jails allows the inmates to acquire ingredients and produce pruno. During jail and prison inmate cell searches, correctional officers remove excessive or unauthorized food items to hopefully halt the production of pruno. Pruno is hidden under bunks, inside toilets, inside walls, trash cans, in the shower area and anywhere inmates feel is safe to brew their pruno away from the prying eyes of correctional officers and jailers. Jarvis Masters, a death row inmate at San Quentin, offers an oft-referenced recipe for pruno in his poem \\"Recipe for Prison Pruno\\", which won a PEN award in 1992. Another recipe for pruno can be found in Michael Finkel's Esquire article on Oregon death row inmate Christian Longo. In 2004 at the American Homebrewers Association's National Homebrew Conference in Las Vegas, a pruno competition and judging was held. A variety of other prison-made alcoholic potables are known to exist. These include crude wines, famously fermented in toilet tanks. Sugary beverages like orange drink may also be fermented and distilled using a radiator or other available heat source. Though popularized in prison fiction, these techniques are slow and laborious, and generally result in a low alcohol content.

Super-Heroes in the 30th and 31st centuries. Publication history The first Invisible Kid debuted alongside Chameleon Boy and Colossal Boy in Action Comics #247 by Jerry Siegel and Jim Mooney. He was introduced as a new member of the Legion of Super-Heroes. Lyle Norg The first Invisible Kid was Lyle Norg, an early member of the Legion who gained his powers from a chemical serum he invented. He first appeared in Action Comics #267. His scientific aptitude meant he got along well with the super-intelligent Brainiac 5. His abilities made him a valuable asset to the Legion Espionage Squad, of which he was a permanent member. Norg also served one term as Legion Leader. He was killed by the monster Validus of the Fatal Five in Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes #203 (July/August 1974). Many years later, during the \\"Five Year Gap\\" following the Magic Wars, Earth fell under the covert control of the Dominators, and withdrew from the United Planets. A few years later, the members of the Dominators' highly classified \\"Batch SW6\\" escaped captivity. Originally, Batch SW6 appeared to be a group of teenage Legionnaire clones, created from samples apparently taken just prior to Ferro Lad's death at the hands of the Sun-Eater (Since Lyle was Legion leader at that time, the members of Batch SW6 were led by the teenage Lyle). Later, they were revealed to be time-paradox duplicates, every bit as legitimate as their older counterparts. After Earth was destroyed in a disaster reminiscent of the destruction of Krypton over a millennium earlier,Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 4) #38, Late December 1992. a few dozen surviving cities and their inhabitants reconstituted their world as New Earth. The SW6 Legionnaires - including their version of Invisible Kid - remained. Reboot Following the Zero Hour Legion reboot, Lyle Norg was still alive and serving with the Legion. As well as a brilliant chemist, he was also a professional spy at a very young age. He invented the invisibility serum while in Earthgov Intelligence's spy school. Rather than his scientific aptitude resulting in his getting on well with Brainiac 5, they had more of a rivalry. While Querl was more intelligent, Lyle had more imagination, being quicker to see unexpected applications for discoveries. He was the de facto leader of the Legion Espionage Squad, consisting of himself, Chameleon, Apparition, Triad, & Shrinking Violet and was instrumental in bringing down the corrupt administration of United Planets President Chu. Lyle served one term as Legion Leader; during his tenure, this version of the Legion defeated Mordru in their first and only battle with the sorcerer. According to The Definitive Guide to The Characters of the DC Universe (2004), he was in a homosexual relationship with Condo Arlik. This, however, was never stated explicitly in the comic book itself and was never developed. \\"Threeboot\\" continuity (2004-2009) Lyle Norg is a genius with a skill for xenochemistry who was used by his father to develop an invisibility serum. His Science Police officer father used to bring him alien cell samples nearly every night to experiment with. By the time he had successfully created a serum, he discovered that his father promised to hand over Lyle's research to the Science Police all along. So he injected the only existing serum into himself and lied about it before contacting Brainiac 5 for help. Brainy invited Lyle to join the Legion. Eventually his father discovered the truth and tried to get Lyle to quit and hand over the serum. After the Legion was outlawed, Lyle reneged and produced a blood sample for his father to use. The sample was encoded with a monitoring virus allowing Legion access to the United Planets systemworks. Because of his relationship to Brainiac 5 his teammates have snarlingly nicknamed him \\"Brainiac 6\\". When Lyle betrayed Cosmic Boy's trust by revealing to Brainiac 5 that several members had broken into Brainy's lab, he lied to the team by blaming everything on Shrinking Violet. He and Violet, who prefers the moniker Atom Girl, have since made a deal to continue the ruse, but his teammates still have a hard time trusting him. When Supergirl mysteriously appeared in the 31st Century, Lyle, along with half the male Legionnaires vied for her attention. However, Lyle convinced Cosmic Boy that he did not have a crush on Supergirl in order to remove the competition for her affections. He recently had his arm torn off when his flight ring exploded, and was given an alien arm to replace it by a member of the Wanderers. He is left in Metropolis, the doctors reproducing his DNA to give him another arm. His arm apparently healed, he returns to the active roster to save a young Tritonian mutant, Gazelle, for whom he carries a torch from then on.Legion of Super-Heroes #38 (March 2008) During an invasion of aliens hailing from cyberspace, a small squad of legionnaires, including him and the recently appointed Gazelle, are digitized and sent into their home base: Invisible Lad has a customized avatar issued by Brainac 5, with a bulkier and more handsome physique that greatly impresses Gazelle (who, despite being saved by him, had never seen his face due to his invisibility powers). However, his idealized body is shown to be a trojan horse able to give Brainiac 5 complete mastery over the alien, digital universe. Invisible Kid, Gazelle and the other legionnaires spend some time trapped in cyberspace, while Brainiac 5 restores their physical bodies, damaged in a skirmish between the Coluan and some physical avatars of the invading aliens: in that week, Invisible Kid admits his feelings for Gazelle who happily reciprocates. Upon returning to the physical world, they both witness Brainiac 5 and Nura Nal exchanging their nuptial vows and inviting them to their marriage.Legion of Super-Heroes #50 (March 2009) Post-Infinite Crisis (2007- ) The events of the Infinite Crisis miniseries have apparently restored a close analogue of the Pre-Crisis Legion to continuity, as seen in \\"The Lightning Saga\\" story arc in Justice League of America and Justice Society of America, and in the \\"Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes\\" story arc in Action Comics. Lyle is depicted as a member of this version of the team in Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #5 (June 2007), and Action Comics #858 (Late December 2007). However, this incarnation of the Legion shares roughly the same history as the original Legion up to the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths.IGN: Superman/Green Lantern interview Therefore, this version of Lyle is presumably deceased. Jacques Foccart Many years later, Brainiac 5 was approached by Jacques Foccart, a teenage native of Earth from what was once the francophone African nation of C√¥te d'Ivoire. Jacques' younger sister Danielle was suffering from a life-threatening neurological disorder which had baffled the best medical experts of the 30th century, and Jacques took her to Brainiac 5 as a last resort. Brainiac 5 rashly decided to utilize a piece of circuitry from the dismantled machine Computo, a highly advanced supercomputer he had created years earlier. Computo promptly possessed Danielle's body. Computo took control of Legion headquarters and the city of Metropolis and nearly killed several Legionnaires. In order to save Danielle and the others, Jacques drank Lyle Norg's serum and gained the power of invisibility. Immediately thereafter, the Legion voted Jacques onto the team as its newest member. He took the name Invisible Kid in honor of Lyle.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 2) Annual # 1, 1982. Within days of Jacques' addition to the team, the Legion faced a new foe whom they initially referred to as the Master of the Servants of Darkness. The Servants' Master possessed a myriad of superpowers, including the ability to generate teleportation tubes out of thin air, and after one encounter Jacques decided to follow him. The sight of the real face of the Servants' Master‚Äîlater revealed as the ancient villain Darkseid‚Äîfrightened Jacques so deeply that a large strip of his jet black hair turned permanently white.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 2) #291, September 1982. Jacques soon learned that, unlike his predecessor, he had also developed the ability to teleport and shift into other dimensions. This talent served him well when he and his teammate Wildfire were almost killed by a Lyle Norg imposter. However, when he caused the death of a criminal by accidentally teleporting him into space, Jacques had the additional powers removed. Jacques served as a permanent member of the Legion Espionage Squad, along with Chameleon Boy, Phantom Girl, and Shrinking Violet. \\"Five Years Later\\" During the \\"Five Year Gap\\" following the Magic Wars, the Legion disbanded and Earth's government fell under the covert control of the Dominators, who had attempted to conquer the planet in the 20th century. Earth withdrew from the United Planets, and the government gradually became more repressive. Jacques became the leader of a resistance cell which included himself, Tyroc, and the former members of the Legion of Substitute Heroes. He became romantically involved with Drura Sepht, a Substitute Hero who once called herself Infectious Lass. He successfully led the resistance to victory over the Dominators, along with the unlikely assistance of former Legion foe Universo and the members of the Dominators' highly classified \\"Batch SW6\\". At the time, Batch SW6 appeared to be a group of teenaged Legionnaire clones, created from samples apparently taken immediately following the team's first encounter with Universo.The Legion first battled Universo in Adventure Comics (vol. 1) #349 (October 1966). In the following issue, Star Boy and Dream Girl rejoined the team under the aliases \\"Sir Prize\\" and \\"Miss Terious\\", but the two are not included in Batch SW6. Later, they were revealed to be time-paradox duplicates, every bit as legitimate as their older counterparts. In any event, the emergence of the SW6 Legionnaires allowed Jacques to meet their leader‚Äîthe real Lyle Norg‚Äîfor the first time. After the defeat of the Dominators, Jacques became a planetary hero. The people of Earth rewarded his efforts by making him president of the planet, with Troy Stewart (Tyroc) serving as vice president. But soon thereafter, Earth was destroyed in a disaster reminiscent of the destruction of Krypton over a millennium earlier.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 4) #38, Late December 1992. A few dozen cities and their inhabitants survived, and the planet was reconstituted as New Earth. Eventually, Jacques resigned as president to rejoin the Legion (where he served as co-leader with Rokk Krinn), and Troy ascended to the presidency. Post-Zero Hour After Legion continuity was completed rebooted by the events of Zero Hour, Jacques was recast as a close friend of Lyle Norg from their days in school. Jacques was forced by Charma, a fellow student who had developed mind control abilities, to drink Lyle's serum as a test to see if it would be safe for her. Jacques was believed to have been killed by the serum, as Lyle had calibrated it to only work with his physiology. In truth, he was saved by the Intelligence Division. The serum worked differently for him than for Lyle, granting him the ability to become undetectable by any means, though this ability causes him severe pain to use. He continued to work for EarthGov's Intelligence. Some time after Lyle joined the Legion, Jacques would later save Lyle from Charma, though he could not reveal that he still lived.Legionnaires #66, December 1998 Post-Infinite Crisis Jacques has not appeared in the \\"Threeboot\\" Legion continuity which began in 2005. However, the events of the Infinite Crisis miniseries have restored a close analogue of the Pre-Crisis on Infinite Earths Legion to continuity, as seen in \\"The Lightning Saga\\" story arc in Justice League of America and Justice Society of America, and in the \\"Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes\\" story arc in Action Comics. Jacques is included in their number. However, the events of the \\"Five Years Later\\" era (including Jacques' rise to the presidency of Earth) are no longer part of mainstream DC continuity. Reception Syfy ranked the first Invisible Kid as the 24th greatest Legion of Superheroes member stating that during \\"his time in the 1960s, Invisible Kid was a constant, but not noteworthy presence, until he was killed by Validus. When the Legion rebooted in 1994, he became a major player, showing he was one of the saaviest members of the team\\". While Syfy ranked the second Invisible Kid as number 38 describing the character as \\"boring\\" and \\"notable because of his name and his Rogue inspired haircut\\". Syfy opined that despite \\"later becoming President of Earth, he never did a whole lot except shout French expressions\\". In other media The Jacques Foccart version of the Invisible Kid has made background appearances in the \\"Lightning Storm\\" and \\"Substitutes\\" episodes of the Legion of Super Heroes animated television series.

After serving in the Ohio House of Representatives from 1848 to 1850, he served as State Attorney General from 1852 to 1854. Pugh served a single term in the United States Senate from 1855 to 1861, losing a re-election bid to Salmon P. Chase, whom he had replaced. In the Senate, he became a champion of the Western Democracy, that is, Midwestern Democrats, first against the Republicans,Don E. Fehrenbacher (1978), The Dred Scott Case, 2001 reprint, New York: Oxford, Part 2, \\"A Decade of Litigation\\", Ch. 12, \\"Before the Supreme Court\\", p. Co, . and later against Stephen A.

On February 23, 1859, during the lame- duck session, Albert Gallatin Brown attacked Douglas over popular sovereignty. Douglas defended his position, and was joined by Charles E.

Pugh said, \\"In the whole Dred Scott case, there was no act of a Territorial legislature before them [the justices] in any shape or form.\\" Pugh explained, \\"This is the first time I ever heard, in a case where nine judges pronounce their opinions seriatim, that because one of them {Roger B.

During the Civil War, he fell into disfavor with the citizens of Ohio because he was a Democrat and for defending Vallandigham and later in 1863, he lost the election for the office of Lieutenant Governor. He also lost in the election for Congress in 1864 and refrained from seeking public office for several years while continuing his legal profession.

The \\"Subs\\", as they are often called, are a group of rejected applicants to the Legion of Super-Heroes who band together, hoping to prove to the Legion that their powers are not as useless as the Legionnaires claim. They first appeared in Adventure Comics #306 (March 1963) and were created by Edmond Hamilton and John Forte. The group were depicted as reasonably effective superheroes until Keith Giffen, during his tenure as Legion writer, began depicting the team as something of a joke. The Subs regain some respect when founding member Polar Boy joins the main Legion, and a new Legion of Substitute Heroes is formed. Publication history The Legion of Substitute Heroes is founded by Polar Boy, Night Girl, Stone Boy, Fire Lad, and Chlorophyll Kid, five young heroes whose powers are not sufficient to earn them membership in the Legion of Super-Heroes -- Stone Boy, for example, is completely immobile when using his power. After receiving a Legion flight belt as a consolation prize, the five disconsolate teenagers decide to form a group that can pinch hit for the Legion. After several failures as a team, the Subs save the Earth from an invasion by Plant Men while the Legion is off planet fighting a decoy armada of robot spaceships. At first operating in secrecy, the Legion of Substitute Heroes is gradually recognized by the real Legion as a valuable asset, most notably after the assault on the Citadel of Throon when the regular Legionnaires are all defeated and it is left to Polar Boy and Night Girl to lead an effective attack and end the siege.Adventure Comics #319 (April 1964) Later recruits to the Legion of Substitute Heroes include Antennae Lad, Color Kid, Double- Header, Infectious Lass, Porcupine Pete, Dream Girl, and Star Boy. The team fell into disuse during the Bronze Age of Comic Books since their simple, young-readers-oriented concept left them out-of-place in the dark, socially relevant stories of the era. The Legion of Substitute Heroes were first presented as a starring feature in DC Comics Presents #59 (July 1983). Writer/artist Keith Giffen had been asked to do a story featuring the villain Ambush Bug, and decided that the Legion of Substitute Heroes would be appropriate heroes to pit against the villain since they were somewhat \\"goofy\\" and obscure enough that he could do what he wanted with them without fear of arousing controversy. Exceptionally good sales on the humor-driven issue led to DC publishing a Legion of Substitute Heroes Special on April Fool's Day, 1985. Again written and drawn by Giffen, the Legion of Substitute Heroes Special became regarded as a seminal work, and Giffen was emboldened to employ the issue's boundary-pushing, often metafictional comedy in his later works. After a colorful, if not exactly impressive, career, the Substitute Heroes are disbanded by Polar Boy. Polar Boy goes on to attain full membership in the Legion of Super-Heroes. Many of the remaining members eventually join the Legion as well during the \\"Five Year Gap\\". Shortly before the \\"Five Year Gap\\", a new Legion of Substitute Heroes is formed.Legion of Super-Heroes Annual #3 (1987) It consists of former Legion of Super-Heroes members Cosmic Boy, Bouncing Boy, and Duo Damsel, as well as Night Girl, a new Karate Kid (Myg of Lythyl), and Comet Queen. During the events of Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 4), the \\"Subs\\" come into their own as an insurgent group that helps the Terran resistance to the Dominators. Here, old Subs Fire Lad, Stone Boy, Chlorophyl Kid, Color Kid, and Porcupine Pete, are joined by new allies such as Ron-Karr and Grinn. Following the Zero Hour reboot, the Subs appear in Legionnaires #43 during Legion tryouts. Infectious Lass, Fire Lad, and Color Kid are on the cover, while Stone Boy, Chlorophyll Kid, Night Girl, and Polar Boy all try out. In the Legion Worlds one-shot focusing on Braal, Cosmic Boy along with Invisible Kid, Leviathan, and Chuck Taine call themselves the \\"Legion of Subs\\"; the word 'Subs' is short for \\"subterfuge\\". In the Legion series launched in 2004, Polar Boy and Chlorophyll Kid (renamed Plant Lad) appear as a part of the new Wanderers led by Mekt Ranzz. This version of Polar Boy can only slow molecular movement. Night Girl applies for membership in the Legion but is rejected and made a reserve member (as part of the \\"Legion Reserve\\"), along with Sizzle, an energy manipulator, and Turtle, a strong and durable alien.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 5) #48 (February 2009) Versions of Infectious Lass, Polar Boy, Night Girl, Stone Boy, Fire Lad, and Chlorophyll Kid similar in appearance to their Pre-Crisis on Infinite Earths counterparts appear in the Tales of the Unexpected limited series and the Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes story arc in Action Comics. In part five of the Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes story arc in Action Comics, Fire Lad, Stone Boy, Chlorophyll Kid, and Rainbow Girl are called in to help battle the Justice League of Earth, a tyrannical, alien-hating association formed out of super-powered beings also rejected by the Legion.Action Comics #862 (February 2008) After the villainous group is defeated, the Subs claim their satellite base as their own.Action Comics #863 (March 2008) At an early point in their timeline, the Substitutes team up with the Inferior Five in a failed attempt to steal the Legion's thunder and destroy a primeval black hole.The Brave and the Bold #35 (July 2010) In other media Legion of Super Heroes Characters from the Legion of Substitute Heroes first appeared in the Legion of Super Heroes episode entitled \\"Lightning Storm\\", and then again in the episode \\"The Substitutes\\", which focused completely on them. They are portrayed as a mix of sympathetic and comedic characters who are determined to be heroes but not entirely aware of their limits. The Legion of Substitute Heroes in the animated series consists of: *Porcupine Pete - portrayed as something of a \\"mother's boy\\" who is not always good with his powers, but is determined to be a hero and has a definite sense of responsibility. Pete easily forgets that his quills can hurt others. He is the unofficial leader of the team. Voiced by James Arnold Taylor. *Chlorophyll Kid - portrayed as a classic nebbish, but clever at using his limited powers, such as creating cacti to distract an enemy with human-like silhouettes. When pushed, he will take risks to protect others. Voiced by Alexander Polinsky. *Stone Boy - portrayed as highly intelligent. He once uses a fall in his stone form to strike an enemy, yet speaks little. In fact, his companions actually were surprised when he did speak up, suggesting that they thought he was mute. His ability to use his stone form ranges from ineffectual to clever, perhaps because he does not have the sense of humor to realize when he is doing something silly. He also at times seems to forget to change back to flesh. He seems to have some small knowledge of science, which he shares with the team, giving an excellent insight on Starfinger's Ionosphere-gobbling space-worms and how to stop them. Voiced by Yuri Lowenthal. *Color Kid - portrayed as energetic, enthusiastic, often ignorant of danger, and a bit flamboyant and campy. He has an excellent eye for color, but has not caught on entirely how limited his powers are. His most noteworthy use of his abilities is to conceal an obstacle to trip a villain and conceal his fellow heroes. Voiced by James Arnold Taylor. *Infectious Lass - portrayed as withdrawn and seems to suffer from a mild asthma-like condition and sounds permanently congested, often sniffling during speech. Her powers involve creating an infectious slime, but it seems limited to creating a quick, mild cold. Voiced by Kari Wahlgren. In addition, Antennae Lad, Polar Boy, Fire Lad, Double-Header, and Night Girl all appeared in cameos in both episodes as prospective members of the Legion. The Substitute Heroes were seen briefly in a battalion during \\"Sundown\\" Part 2, although never actually participating in the fight against the Sun-Eater. In the second-season (and series) finale, \\"Dark Victory\\", the Substitute Heroes and other previously rejected auditions from the first season are shown among the Legion during Cosmic Boy's speech in part one. Polar Boy is briefly seen in part two. Smallville In the Smallville episode \\"Legion\\", Cosmic Boy tells Lightning Lad that he is acting like a Sub when he asks Clark to autograph the first baseball Clark had ever hit, claiming it was for his sister.

It was formed in 1986 by Salvatore Cazzetta, a former friend of Hells Angels Quebec chapter president Maurice Boucher, and competed with the Hells Angels for the street-level drug trade in Montreal. The Quebec Biker war saw Rock Machine form an alliance with a number of other gangs. The conflict occurred between 1994 and 2002 and resulted in over 160 casualties and an unknown number of injuries. When the Rock Machine became a probationary chapter of the Bandidos motorcycle club in December 2000, after being an official hangaround club for eighteen months, Bandidos national officer Edward Winterhalder was put in charge of overseeing the transition by Bandidos international president George Wegers. The original version of the Rock Machine (1986 to 1999) in Canada changed their colors from black and platinum to red and gold in May 1999; their colors remained red and gold until they became Bandidos in December 2000. After the few remaining Bandidos members in Canada quit the organization and Bandidos Canada was dissolved, ex-members of the Mongols and the Bandidos reformed the Rock Machine in 2007, adopting the original black and platinum colors as their patch. As of 2008, the latest incarnation of Rock Machine claims to be a club of motorcycle enthusiasts that is not involved in criminal activity. Early history In approximately 1982, Salvatore Cazzetta was a member of the \\"SS\\", a white supremacist motorcycle gang based in Pointe- aux-Trembles, on the eastern tip of the Island of Montreal. Fellow SS member Maurice Boucher became friends with Cazzetta and, as leaders of the gang, the pair became candidates to join the Hells Angels when the gang expanded into Canada. A Lennoxville, Quebec chapter of the Hells Angels suspected in March 1985 that the Laval chapter was interfering with drug profits through personal use of products intended for sale. It is believed that the Laval chapter's invitation to a Lennoxville chapter party led to the ambush and death of five Laval members. Divers located the decomposing bodies of the victims at the bottom of the St. Lawrence River, wrapped in sleeping bags and tied to weightlifting plates, two months after the party. The event became known as the Lennoxville massacre, and its extreme nature earned the Quebec chapter of the Hells Angels a notorious reputation. Cazzetta considered the event an unforgivable breach of the outlaw code and, rather than joining the Hells Angels, in 1986 formed his own smaller gang, the Rock Machine, with his brother Giovanni. Future Rock Machine leader Fred Faucher later said, \\"Sal once told me, 'Those guys [Hells Angels], they operate their club in such a way that I didn't want to join them'\\". Rock Machine members chose not to wear Hells Angels-style leather vests that could easily identify members, and instead wore rings displaying an eagle insignia.Martineau, Pierre I Was a Killer for the Hells Angels, McClelland & Stewart Ltd., 2003 () The official Rock Machine club motto is \\"A La Vie A La Mort\\", or \\"To the Life Until Death\\". Boucher, after finishing a forty-month sentence for armed sexual assault, joined the Hells Angels and was subsequently promoted within the club's ranks. The Hells Angels and Rock Machine co-existed peacefully for many years, a situation that, according to police officials, was due to Boucher's respect for Cazzetta and the latter's connections with the Quebec Mafia, the only organized crime group that the motorcycle gangs were unwilling to attack. Quebec Biker war Cazzetta was arrested at a pitbull farm located in Fort Erie, Ontario in 1994 and charged with attempting to import eleven tons of cocaine. Recently promoted Hells Angels Montreal president Boucher began to increase pressure on the Rock Machine shortly after the arrest, which initiated the Quebec Biker war. The much smaller gang Rock Machine formed an affiliation, \\"the Alliance\\", with Montreal crime families such as the Pelletier clan and other independent dealers who wished to resist the Angels' attempts to establish a monopoly on street-level drug trade in the city.Winterhalder, Edward Out In Bad Standings; Inside The Bandidos Motorcycle Club, Blockhead City Press, 2005/Seven Locks Press, 2007 () A violent turf war ensued with the Hells Angels. Boucher organized \\"puppet clubs\\" to persuade Rock Machine-controlled bars and their resident drug dealers to surrender their illegal drug business. Rock Machine resistance led to bloodshed. Two members of the Hells Angels' top puppet club entered a downtown motorcycle shop on July 14, 1994, and shot down a Rock Machine associate. \\"That was the beginning of the war,\\" Ouellette said. A Jeep wired with a remote-controlled bomb exploded that August, killing a Rock Machine associate and an 11-year-old boy, Daniel Desrochers, who was playing in a nearby schoolyard. The first full Hells Angels member was shot to death entering his car at a shopping mall a month later. Nine bombs went off around the province during his funeral.\\" This turf war prompted the Rock Machine to align itself with the Bandidos motorcycle club from Texas. Ten individuals allegedly displaying Rock Machine colours were spotted on July 21, 2011, in a downtown Montreal strip club, the location where a Rock Machine leader had been savagely beaten 10 years previously by Hells Angels associates.  Break from Bandidos  After the 2006 massacre that claimed the lives of eight prominent Bandidos at a farm house in Shedden, Ontario, the Bandidos Canada closed its doors officially in October 2007. Infighting, lack of support from US and European Bandidos, and the Canadian members' suspicions about their US counterparts' involvement in the Shedden murders led to the closure. The Rock Machine was reopened in early April 2008 by several disgruntled members of the now-defunct Bandidos Canada \\"No Surrender Crew\\", who reorganized it as the Rock Machine Canada Nomads. The move was intended as an insult towards the Bandidos US national chapter and Bandidos National President Jeffrey Pike in particular, but gained unexpected momentum. The club spread across Canada and over several countries including the United States and Australia. The new Rock Machine maintains an enmity towards the Texas-based Bandidos, despite claims in Alex Caine's book The Fat Mexican that Rock Machine members in 2008 made a secret deal with high-ranking members of the Bandidos national chapter to re-open in Canada. The club says that it now dismisses members who are involved in any known crimes or criminal activity. Members Well-known former members of the Rock Machine included Peter Paradis, who later testified for the Crown at the trials of other members, Richard \\"Bam-Bam\\" Lagac√© (deceased), Johnny Plescio (deceased), Tony Plescio (deceased), Renaud Jomphe (deceased), Frederic Faucher, Alain Brunette. The Rock Machine was absorbed into the Bandidos motorcycle club in 2000, in a patch-over ceremony overseen by high-ranking Bandidos member Edward Winterhalder. They remained Bandidos for seven years. Many Rock Machine members at the time joined their former arch-enemy, the Hells Angels, due to the Bandidos' refusal to grant full status to junior-patched members of the Rock Machine. Members who defected to the Angels included Paul Porter and Nelson Fernandes. Fernandes died of cancer within months of becoming a Hells Angel.Cherry, Paul The Biker Trials: Bringing Down the Hells Angels, ECW Press, 2005 ()  Australia A Rock Machine chapter was established in the Perth suburb of Myaree in 2009. The defection of a Rebels MC member to the Rock Machine sparked an ongoing violent feud between the gangs in Perth. The club received negative publicity when an associate Stefan Pahia Schmidt was charged with murder after throwing a pub patron through a window with a seven- metre fall. It is alleged that Schmidt was present with other Rock Machine members when the victim spoke with two women from the Rock Machine group. A group was also formed in South Australia. The leader was arrested in Adelaide at the 2019 Royal Adelaide show.https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/subscribe/news/1/?sourceCode=AAWEB_WRE170_a_GGL&dest;=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adelaidenow.com.au%2Fnews%2Flaw- order%2Fdrugs-gun-seized-at-paralowie-and-athol-park-amid-police- investigation-into-outlaw-bikies%2Fnews- story%2F77b0416ab4b265bb0fa77f240bf84347&memtype;=anonymous&mode;=premium References  Further reading  External links * CBC News In Depth: Biker Gangs in CanadaDead Link * CBC News In Depth: Canada's Anti-gang LawDead Link * The Fifth Estate: The Road to Hell: The Rise of the Hells Angels in QuebecDead Link * York University's Nathanson Center for the Study of Organized Crime and CorruptionDead Link Outlaw motorcycle clubs Bandidos Motorcycle Club Gangs in Canada Gangs in Montreal Organized crime in Montreal 1986 establishments in Quebec Motorcycle clubs in Canada Motorcycle clubs in Australia Motorcycle clubs in the United States ","title":"Rock Machine"},{"id":"713674","text":"John Murphy may refer to: Military *John Murphy (priest) (1753‚Äì1798), one of the leaders during the Irish Rebellion of 1798 *John Murphy (Saint Patrick's Battalion) (fl. 1846-1848), Irish soldier *John McLeod Murphy (1827‚Äì1871), U.S. Navy officer during the American Civil War *John E.

An original part of the town, Assonet was settled in 1659 along with the city of Fall River, then a part of Freetown. It rests on the banks of the Assonet River. As of the 2000 census, the village had a total population of 4,084; up from 3,614 in 1990. As of the 2014 census the village had a total estimated population of 9,093.https://www.census.gov History Assonet was first settled in 1659, shortly after the completion of Ye Freemen's Purchase. It was part of the Plymouth Colony until the 1691 merger with the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The word comes from the local Wampanoag Indians, who had a settlement in the area, and has two meanings: \\"place of rocks\\" and \\"song of praise\\". Those meanings are traditional, but the former can be segmented as (h)assun-et where hassun or assin is a word used by southern New England Algonquian to mean stone. The -et is a locative suffix, to give the meaning \\"at the place of the stone\\". The entire region was sold to the English in 1659 by the Wampanoags, but, due to the Algonquian mobile way of life and the splitting and recombining of social units, the Nipmucs may have been subject to or at the time part of the Wampanoags. The English settlement remained for many years a small fishing and farming village, growing to be Freetown's more industrious side by the end of the 18th century. By the end of the 19th century, Assonet had begun to slowly return to its origins, having less and less industry in town. At the beginning of the 21st century, the village has once again begun to expand rapidly. 17th century Assonet was settled on April 2, 1659, but a string of wars between English settlers and the local Wampanoag Indians, including King Philip's War, prevented much permanent settlement until later. History shows the area existed as a proprietary settlement as early as 1680, and in 1683 Assonet and Fall River were incorporated as the Town of Freetown, named as such because its settlers were Freemen. The earliest records of the town, from approximately 1680-1685, have been lost. Since then, records have been kept and maintained to trace back the town's legacy. Little development occurred after the incorporation of the town, other than the construction of houses and smaller businesses. 18th century Assonet became a prominent commercial fishing port in Southeastern Massachusetts in the 18th century, best known for its trout. Industry had also begun to develop, including grist mills, sawmills and a blacksmith's shop. As the century progressed, the villagers began to fall under the same strains as the rest of the colonists. Assonet was far enough east that it avoided many of the problems faced during the French and Indian War, but did feature in the Revolutionary War. Skirmishes were fought in Assonet, and the Battle of Freetown was fought on the outskirts of the village in present-day Fall River. The main settled area of the village was known to support the British, even harboring a general before he fled to Newport, Rhode Island. The white chimneys with black rings on many of the oldest houses are indicative of homes that supported the British. As the 18th century closed, churches and other more prominent buildings began to pop up around the village, including the 1794 construction of Village School, then the office of a Raynham lawyer. 19th century c. 1900. The 19th century was perhaps the most industrious period in the history of Assonet. The village developed rapidly, with its combination of railroads, ships, its position on the stagecoach and mail routes, and its factories. The current Route 79 roughly follows the mail and stagecoach route from Rhode Island to Boston, and the Green Dragon Tavern on South Main Street was a popular stopover along the route. The downtown area boasted shipbuilding and was an import/export port, as well as a successful fishing industry. John M. Deane was a native of Assonet, and a recipient of the Medal of Honor.The N. R. Davis Gun Manufactory, located near and on a portion of where Hathaway Park now sits, opened and provided many weapons to Union soldiers during the Civil War. Also built was the Crystal Springs Bleachery and Dying Company, which brought millhousing to a small area of the village, and employed many from town and neighboring Fall River, also known for industry. North Church (1809), Town Hall (1888), and the Guilford H. Hathaway Library (1895) were all constructed in the same small area on Taunton Hill, and complimented the Village School nicely. The Town Hall has served as the municipal office building (1888‚Äìpresent), meeting hall (1888‚Äì1976), library (1888‚Äì1895), police station (1888‚Äì1978), and a variety of other functions. The second floor, literally a hall, was subdivided into office space in the mid-1970s. The Guilford Hathaway Library (b. 1895) served as the town's only library from its construction until the James White Library opened in East Freetown in 1947. The first Post Office in town opened in Assonet in 1811, and has operated continuously since then, first in a razed building on the corner of Elm and North Main Streets, later in a second razed building, and since 1962 at the facility on South Main Street near the former Assonet Star Market. The ZIP Code for Assonet is 02702. 20th century This photo from a 1902 postcard shows Profile Rock, which is said to be the image of Chief Massasoit. In the mid-20th century, Assonet began to remove itself from the commercial/industrial scene. Most of its mills closed during this period, following the Second World War. The N. R. Davis Gun Factory burned to the ground in 1925; and the Crystal Springs Bleachery, now New England Textile, burned in 1955. (Remnants of the latter can be found by Mill Pond.) The former Monument Manufacturing Company on Mill & Locust Sts. was the largest domestic producer of sleeping bags during World War II. In the postwar period, the majority of villagers sought work outside of town, and farming also came back into common practice. This reverse trend would not last long. By the 1990s, the village began to develop again as the region was seen as a \\"great escape\\" for upperclass Boston workers. Next to the Hathaway Library is a local Verizon station, which is the home of one of the first regional dialing systems. Not far away is Freetown Fire Department Company 1, constructed in 1948. 21st century The 21st century has brought a renewed spirit to Assonet. The Stop & Shop Supermarket Company opened a new 1.3 million square foot (120,000 m2) distribution center on near the site of the Crystal Springs Bleachery after it received a tax increment financing agreement from the town, which has saved the company almost $2 million in property tax as of 2007.2007 Stop and Shop Annual Report They provided over 800 jobs to the region but as of 2005, only 36 of those jobs are held by residents of Freetown.2005 Stop and Shop Annual Report Portions of the village were designated to the National Register of Historic Places. Historic District The Assonet Historic District has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1999. The boundaries are, roughly, High Street, the railroad tracks, a private road, and Route 24. It contains many buildings of local and widespread historical significance, including the home of United States Secretary of State John Hay's grandfather. Properties *Assonet Burying Ground (c.1800) *Col. Thomas Gilbert House (c.1700) *Freetown Town Hall (1888) *Guilford H. Hathaway Library (1895) *North Church (1809) (now the United Church of Assonet) *South Church (c.1835) (now St. Bernard's Church) *Village School (1794) Churches In 1795, 1835, 1809, and 1937, three Christian churches were built in Assonet. Additionally, throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, several Quaker meetinghouses were active. Baptist Church The original Baptist Church (1795) was built on the site of South Church. The building suffered a string of misfortune, culminating with it burning following a lightning strike c. 1835. Some of the building was maintained, but arguably most of the building was new as of 1835. South Church South Church (1795/1835) served as the First Christian Church of Assonet steadily until 1916, then again from 1917‚Äì1922. At this time, it began alternating weekly services with the Congregational Church, from 1922-1944. In 1968, the church combined with the Congregational Church to form the United Church of Assonet, and South Church was sold in 1979. A parsonage was built to its left in 1899, and there are cemeteries both across the street from the church, and on the property. Baptisms were originally performed in the Assonet River. North Church North Church (1809) served as the Congregational Church until 1916, when it formed the Federated Church of Assonet. Its on-and- off independence mirrored that of the First Christian Church, except from 1916-1917 North Church was the facility utilized. The joining of the two congregations in 1968 fell under the roof of the North Church, which is still used today. The steeple of the church contains a bell cast by Paul Revere. A non-adjacent parsonage still exists further up Taunton Hill as a business. The church currently belongs to the United Church of Christ. Rev. Gregory N. Baker serves as minister. St. Bernard's Church St. Bernard's Church Roman Catholics did not have a home in Assonet until 1912, when a mission was created. Services were held in private homes until 1937, when St. Bernard's Catholic ChurchSt. Bernard's Catholic Church was constructed on the site of Col. Ebeneezer Pierce's home on So. Main St. It opened in 1938. As the congregation grew too large for the small church, St. Bernard's Church was sold and its parishioners moved into South Church, heavily renovated and renamed St. Bernard's Church. St. Bernard's Parish remains in South Church , and the parsonage has remained as the rectory. The former St. Bernard's, which was sold in 1981, has been a string of businesses since then. Most recently, it was a diner, then a Greek restaurant, a martial arts studio, and is a private residence. Assonet is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fall River.  Schools  From the early 19th century until 1950, Freetown was serviced by several neighborhood grammar schools, at least three of which existed in Assonet. South School South School, 1869‚Äì1950, currently exists at the corner of Copicut Road and South Main Street. It was a three- room schoolhouse used initially for grades 1‚Äì8, and later for grades 3‚Äì6 and \\"special class\\". Grades 3‚Äì4 were in one room on the east side and grades 5‚Äì6 in one room on the west side of the building. There was one teacher for each room of two grades. Ethel O'Brien was the grades 5‚Äì6 teacher in the mid-1940s. There were no bathrooms and the outhouse (since razed) was located at the Northwest corner. A grassy play area was adjacent the grades 3‚Äì4 side of the building and Red Rover was played in the street at recess time. Before being abandoned, it spent time as an American Legion hall. It is currently unoccupied, but remains in the possession of the American Legion. =Structure= It is a one-story, ground-level building with three rooms. There is no discernible cellar. The building is constructed of brick, and is covered in white clapboards. Most of the windows have been removed or boarded over, so an analysis cannot be provided. There were windows on the East and West walls that are no longer visible (2012). Village School Village School, closed in 1950, currently exists on Taunton Hill between the Town Hall and North Church, being the elder of those two buildings by 94 and 15 years, respectively. It began as a lawyer's office in 1794, then became a string of schools. Originally, the minister of North Church served as the schoolmaster. In the 1850s it was a private school, the Assonet Academy. It was purchased by the town circa 1903 and used as a grammar school until 1950 for grades 1-8, and later grades 1 and 2. In the 1940s, grades 1-2 were on the left (South) side and grades 7-8 on the right (North) side of the building. Heat was provided by a pot-bellied wood-burning stove in each room. Mrs. Cudworth was the grades 1-2 teacher and both grades were in the same room; two grades, one teacher. In the 1980s and 1990s, the structure was used for public meetings of municipal committees. Throughout its history, it served as a meeting place for local Boy and Girl Scout troops. Currently, the Town Hall uses it for storage. =Structure= It is a two-story building, with two rooms on the upper (primary) floor. The lower floor is a two-room cellar, and partially underground. The foundation is brick, and the building itself is wood. The exterior is white clapboards, and the front staircase has a portico and both wooden and iron railings. A cupola adorns the center of the roof, and the windows are six-over-one. The interior of the building is divided in the center, with the wall travelling parallel to School Street between the two front doors. Each room has chalkboards (blackboards) running along the walls, and hanging fixtures from the ceiling provide artificial light when necessary. The building has no plumbing and a woodstove provides heat, with a central brick chimney. An outhouse, now razed, was located at the left rear of the building. Facing the building from Taunton Hill, the righthand room is painted in bright colors, and was formerly used for meetings of the Girl Scouts and the town's Cultural Council. The lefthand room is panelled in faux stained wood, and was used by the Boy Scouts. A revitalization effort, begun a few years ago, seeks funds to help restore the ailing structure, which suffers from the effects of weather, rot, deterioration, and a lack of maintenance funds. * See also: Village School House Restoration Forge School The latest in a string of schools known as the Forge School closed in 1940. It functioned irregularly from c.1920 - 1940 and housed grades 7 and 8. The schoolhouse was later converted to a dwelling house, which burned in 2002. It has since been rebuilt, now with dormers. From 1857-1862, the Forge School existed in an outbuilding known as the \\"corn crib\\" on the property of Daniel Macomber on Forge Road, which was once the site of the oldest dwelling in town, dating back to the 17th century. Today From 1950 on, students have attended the Freetown Elementary School, first for grades 1-8, later K-6, and currently PreK-3. Students then attend the George R. Austin Intermediate School for grades 4-5, and Freetown-Lakeville Middle School for grades 6-8. For public secondary education, students have three options: Apponequet Regional High School serves students with an academic focus for grades 9-12. Old Colony Regional Vocational Technical High School in Rochester accepts students from Assonet when there are openings, and provides a voc-tech atmosphere. Bristol County Agricultural High School serves students wanting to focus primarily in agricultural and animal studies. In addition, there are a variety of Catholic high schools in the area. Geography USGS aerial photo of the Assonet River, Assonet Bay, and Assonet Bay Shores. Assonet is located in Southeastern Massachusetts. It is bounded by Fall River, Berkley, Lakeville, East Freetown, and the Assonet River. It has a hilly terrain, with many outcroppings of bedrock. One such outcropping is the famous Profile Rock, a rock said to resemble the profile of Wampanoag Indian chief Massasoit. Maple, elm, oak, pine, and birch trees are common throughout. Numerous streams and brooks flow through the village, as does the Assonet River. Bodies of water include Assonet Bay and Mill Pond. Bryant's Neck, also called Assonet Bay Shores, is a large peninsula situated between Shephard's Cove and Assonet proper on Assonet Bay. This area is also well known for its salt marshes. The area around Mill Pond is frequented for its herring runs. A large section of the village comprises approximately one third of the Freetown-Fall River State Forest.

They are adversaries of the Legion of Super-Heroes in the future. They first appeared as adults in Superman #147 (Aug 1961) and as teens in Adventure Comics #372 (Sept 1968). The team originated at a time when Superman editor Mort Weisinger was consciously adding new elements to the \\"Superman mythos\\" over a period of years, building an extended cast of supporting characters who could provide new story opportunities. The creation of the Legion of Super-Heroes was part of that plan, and in the Legion's fourth appearance (\\"The Army of Living Kryptonite Men\\" in Superboy #86, Jan 1961), there's a suggestion that Lex Luthor would someday lead a group of super-villains. Seven months later, in Superman #147's story \\"The Legion of Super-Villains\\", that prediction came true. Fictional team history Pre-Crisis, the Legion first appears when Lex Luthor creates a radio to contact the future, hoping to send a message to a Legion of Super- Villains, feeling there must be an evil counterpart to the Legion of Super- Heroes. He is broken out of jail by a gun, flying belt, and force-field helmet being sent into his cell. He then meets the trio of villains, Cosmic King, Lightning Lord and Saturn Queen, who tell him of their origins. They cause trouble for Superman and finally an illusion cast by Saturn Queen succeeds in luring him to a planetoid, where a Kryptonite field holds him. He is told the origins of the LSV, and sentenced to death in a parody of the way the Legion of Super-Heroes voted him in, but the adult Legion of Super-Heroes appears and battles their foes. Luthor threatens to kill Superman, but Saturn Woman offers herself in his place. Superman asks for a tribute to her and is released after promising not to rescue her. He uses part of Saturn's rings to create a ring round the planetoid, causing Saturn Queen to hypnotize the villains before they can kill Saturn Woman, as it is revealed Saturn's rings somehow make the inhabitants stay good. Saturn Queen is given a fragment to make sure she stays good, and the other villains are jailed. However, they would battle Superman at other points, such as during Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?, where they aid Brainiac in assaulting Superman at his Fortress of Solitude. They also kill Lana Lang, before fleeing back to the future when Superman brutally attacks Lightning Lord. Pre-Crisis, the Legion of Super-Villains was founded by Tarik the Mute, who had suffered irreparable damage to his vocal cords during a battle with the Science Police and subsequently developed a pathological hatred of law and order. He founded a school for supervillains, which served as the headquarters and recruiting grounds for the Legion's first incarnation. He blackmailed Colossal Boy into joining as a teacher. Several other incarnations of the group formed over the years, led first by Sun Emperor and then by Nemesis Kid. In the last incarnation they conquered the low-tech planet of Orando, the homeworld of Princess Projectra, and slipped it into another dimension as a base of operations. Each villain was sworn to kill one Legionnaire, but only Nemesis Kid succeeded, fatally wounding Karate Kid. In Post-Crisis continuity, some of the members of the Legion of Super-Villains attempted to remake the universe by tampering with the origins of Superman and Batman and adopting them as their own \\"children\\", eventually transforming them into the dictators of Earth, and eliminating other members of the JLA to stop them from interfering. Superman and Batman managed to overcome their brainwashing, however, due to the Darkseid of another reality telling them what had happened; they restored the timestream to its proper course, and took the villains to the 31st century to be imprisoned, but kept the memories of their lives with the villains.Superman/Batman #14-18 (January‚ÄìApril 2005) Five Years Later During the fourth volume of Legion of Super-Heroes, the Legion of Super-Villains has disbanded, and some of its members had actually reformed. Echo joined the Legion during the Five Year Gap, but resigned after the events of Black Dawn.Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 4 #28 (April 1992) Lightning Lord reformed and went to work on his family's plantation on Winath.Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 4 #3 (January 1990) Ron-Karr joined the Legion of Substitute HeroesLegion of Super-Heroes vol. 4 #16 (March 1991) and Spider Girl joined the Legion,Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 4 #54 (February 1994) nursing some feelings for Jo Nah and changing her identity to \\"Wave\\" when the Legion went on the run. Saturn Queen married Matter-Eater Lad and reformed after retrieving her family's hypno-stone from Prince Evillo, ultimately becoming queen of Titan.Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 4 #50 (Late November 1993) Radiation Roy, however, was kidnapped by the Dominator- controlled Earthgov and almost mindwiped as a soldier for the Dominion.Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 4 #27 (March 1992) These events were all wiped out by Zero Hour.Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 4 #62 (November 1994) The Lightning Saga Manifestations of the LSV based on the nightmares of Dream Girl appeared at the end of Justice Society of America vol. 3 #4 (2007), where they kill the guards of Arkham Asylum. Superman and the Legion of Super- Heroes In Action Comics #859 (2008), Spider Girl and Radiation Roy are shown to be members of the xenophobic Justice League of Earth, along with other rejected Legion of Super-Heroes applicants Earth Man (formerly Absorbency Boy), Eyeful Ethel, Tusker, Golden Boy, and Storm Boy. Spider Girl is now in a relationship with Earth-Man, the League's leader, and traded the Legionnaire White Witch to Mordru, in return for his staying off the planet. Roy now has to wear a containment suit, since his radioactive powers have caused him to develop tumors all over his body, specifically one dominating the right side of his face. Defeated by Superman and the Legionnaires, the Justice Leaguers are sent to the prison planet Takron-Galtos. Final Crisis: Legion of Three Worlds The Legion of Super-Villains appear in the Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds miniseries which runs from August 2008 to September 2009. This incarnation of the Legion includes Lightning Lord, Saturn Queen, Cosmic King, Sun Emperor, Beauty Blaze, Ol-Vir, Tyr, Zymyr, Hunter, and Chameleon Chief as well as other Legion of Super-Heroes villains Black Mace, Universo, Dr. Regulus, Grimbor the Chainsman, Mordru, Esper Lass, Magno Lad, Micro Lad, Echo, Terrus, the League of Super-Assassins (Silver Slasher, Lazon, Neutrax, Mist Master, and Titania), the Fatal Five (Tharok, Emerald Empress, Persuader, Mano, and Validus), and the Justice League of Earth (Radiation Roy, Tusker, Spider Girl, Golden Boy, Storm Boy, and Earth-Man). In addition, the group is led by Superboy-Prime. The villains are broken out of Takron-Galtos by Superboy-Prime, and reveal to him that it was he who inspired them to band together.Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #1 (October 2008) Each member is later given copies of the Legion of Super-Heroes' flight rings bearing Prime's \\"S\\" symbol. The Legion of Super-Villains later appear on Sorcerer's World as Mordru is trying to stop Dawnstar, Wildfire, Blok, and Green Lantern/Legionnaire Rond Vidar from rescuing the White Witch. The White Witch manages to create a stargate, but Rond forces them through and is left to fight the Legion by himself. After Vidar has fought off several Legion members, Saturn Queen gets inside his head and starts to hinder his willpower. When Prime grabs Rond by the neck, Saturn Queen tells him to wait, since Rond is Universo's son. Universo shows no care for Rond and only wants his power ring. Rond mocks him, telling him it can never be his, and spits in his face before Prime snaps his neck. Universo tries to take his ring, but it flies off to Oa. Mordru is then offered membership in the Legion, telling him it can only be temporary, which is the same case for the Fatal Five and the Justice League of Earth. Earth Man sums it up by saying that, as much as the various villains dislike each other, they all want the Legion of Super-Heroes dead. They head for Earth and launch an attack on the Legionnaires.Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #2 (November 2008) Eventually, the tide turns against them as the White Witch uses Mordru's spell \\"Aufero magus infusco!\\" three times to absorb Mordru and his magic.Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #5 (September 2009) Post-Legion of Three Worlds In Adventure Comics vol. 2 #3 (2009), it was revealed that the Legion of Super-Villains has sent an espionage squad back into the 21st century. It has also been revealed that Saturn Queen has been reforming the group in order to bring anarchy back to the universe, starting with the destruction of the worlds that house the immortal beings that represent will (Oa), faith (the Rock of Eternity), and wisdom (Utopia, the World of the Wise, homeworld of supporting character Harmonia Li).Legion of Super-Heroes #15, released July 2011 Roster The members of the Legion included: * Akka - Expert martial artist from the planet Sklar.

In other media The Legion of Super-Villains appeared in the Legion of Super Heroes episode \\"Lightning Storm\\". The lineup consists of Lightning Lord (voiced by James Arnold Taylor), Hunter (voiced by Khary Payton), Esper (voiced by Tara Strong), Tyr (voiced by Khary Payton), Wave, and Ron-Karr (voiced by Shawn Harrison with the character depicted as a shapeshifter). This version is primarily led by Lightning Lord. Calling themselves the \\"Light Speed Vanguard\\" they pretend to be superheroes and attempt to outperform the Legion of Super-Heroes. However, they are soon revealed to be financially motivated protector-extortionists and assassins. The team, minus Lightning Lord, return at the beginning of Season 2 assisting the Fatal Five. Now led exclusively by Tyr in the absence of Lightning Lord, they appear as one of several teams of villains released from prison by Imperiex. In that same episode, Brainiac 5 later refers to them officially as the Legion of Super-Villains.

He served in the U.S. Senate as well as serving as the Secretary of the Treasury and the first Secretary of the Interior. He is also known as the foster father (and subsequently father-in-law) of famous American Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman. Biography Born in West Liberty, Ohio County, Virginia (now West Virginia), he was the son of Revolutionary War veteran George Ewing. After studying at Ohio University and reading law under Philemon Beecher, Ewing commenced the practice of law in Lancaster, Ohio, in 1816. The Zachary Taylor Administration, 1849 Daguerreotype by Mathew Brady From left to right: William B. Preston, Thomas Ewing, John M. Clayton, Zachary Taylor, William M. Meredith, George W. Crawford, Jacob Collamer and Reverdy Johnson, (1849). As a colorful country lawyer, he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1830 as a Whig and served a single term. He was unsuccessful in seeking a second term in 1836. Ewing served as Secretary of the Treasury in 1841, serving under Presidents William Henry Harrison and John Tyler. He resigned on September 11, 1841, along with the entire cabinet (except Secretary of State Daniel Webster), in protest of Tyler's veto of the Banking Act. Ewing was later appointed to serve as the first Secretary of the Interior by President Zachary Taylor. Ewing served in the position from March 8, 1849 ‚Äì July 22, 1850 under Taylor and Millard Fillmore. As first secretary, he consolidated bureaus from various Departments, such as the Land Office from the Treasury Department and the Indian Bureau from the War Department. The bureaus were being kicked out of their offices as unwanted tenants in their former departments. However, the Interior Department had no office space, so Ewing rented space. Later, the Patent Office building, with a new east wing, provided permanent space in 1852. Ewing initiated the Interior Department's culture of corruption by wholesale replacement of officials with political patronage. Newspapers called him \\"Butcher Ewing\\" for his efforts. In 1850, Ewing was appointed to the Senate to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Thomas Corwin, and served from July 20, 1850 ‚Äì March 3, 1851. Ewing was unsuccessful in seeking re-election in 1850. In 1861, Ewing served as one of Ohio's delegates to the peace conference held in Washington in hopes of staving off civil war. After the war, Ewing was appointed by President Andrew Johnson to a third cabinet post as Secretary of War in 1868 following the firing of Edwin M. Stanton but the Senate, still outraged at Johnson's firing of Stanton‚Äîwhich had provoked Johnson's impeachment‚Äîrefused to act on the nomination. Ewing in 1856 Ewing married Maria Wills Boyle, a Roman Catholic, and raised their children in her faith. His foster son was the famous general William Tecumseh Sherman. Sherman eventually married Thomas Ewing Sr.'s daughter, Ellen Ewing Sherman. Ewing's namesake son, Thomas Ewing Jr., was an American Civil War Union army general and two-term U.S. Congressman from Ohio. Two of Ewing's other sons ‚Äì Hugh Boyle Ewing and Charles Ewing ‚Äì also became generals in the Union army during the Civil War. Ewing was born a Presbyterian, but for many years attended Catholic services with his family. He was formally baptized into the Catholic faith during his last illness.Lewis, 33-34, 609-10. Ewing remained a Whig following his joining of the party in 1833, even when the national Whig Party collapsed and was replaced by the Republican Party. This makes Ewing one of the only federal politicians to remain a member the Whig Party when many others bolted to the Republican or American parties. Prior to his death on October 26, 1871, Ewing had been the last surviving member of the Harrison and Tyler Cabinets. Future President and Governor of Ohio Rutherford B. Hayes was a pallbearer at his funeral. He is buried in Saint Mary Cemetery, Lancaster, Fairfield County, Ohio.

Badiou has written about the concepts of being, truth, event and the subject in a way that, he claims, is neither postmodern nor simply a repetition of modernity. Badiou has been involved in a number of political organisations, and regularly comments on political events. Badiou argues for a return of communism as a political force. Biography Badiou is the son of the mathematician Raymond Badiou (1905‚Äì1996), who was a working member of the Resistance in France during World War II. Alain Badiou was a student at the Lyc√©e Louis-Le-Grand and then the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure (1955‚Äì1960).Tzuchien Tho, Giuseppe Bianco, Badiou and the Philosophers: Interrogating 1960s French Philosophy, A&C; Black, 2013, pp. xvii. In 1960, he wrote his ' (roughly equivalent to an MA thesis) on Spinoza for Georges Canguilhem (the topic was \\"Demonstrative Structures in the First Two Books of Spinoza's Ethics\\", \\"Structures d√©monstratives dans les deux premiers livres de l'√âthique de Spinoza\\").Tzuchien Tho, Giuseppe Bianco, Badiou and the Philosophers: Interrogating 1960s French Philosophy, A&C; Black, 2013, pp. xviii‚Äìxix. He taught at the lyc√©e in Reims from 1963 where he became a close friend of fellow playwright (and philosopher) Fran√ßois Regnault,Fran√ßois Regnault Homepage at Cahiers pour l'Analyse and published a couple of novels before moving first to the faculty of letters of the University of Reims (the coll√®ge litt√©raire universitaire) and then to the University of Paris VIII (Vincennes-Saint Denis) in 1969.Badiou Homepage at Concept and Form: The Cahiers pour l'Analyse and Contemporary French Thought Badiou was politically active very early on, and was one of the founding members of the Unified Socialist Party (PSU). The PSU was particularly active in the struggle for the decolonization of Algeria. He wrote his first novel, Almagestes, in 1964. In 1967 he joined a study group organized by Louis Althusser, became increasingly influenced by Jacques Lacan and became a member of the editorial board of Cahiers pour l'Analyse. By then he \\"already had a solid grounding in mathematics and logic (along with Lacanian theory)\\", and his own two contributions to the pages of Cahiers \\"anticipate many of the distinctive concerns of his later philosophy\\". The student uprisings of May 1968 reinforced Badiou's commitment to the far Left, and he participated in increasingly militant groups, such as the Union des communistes de France marxiste-l√©niniste (UCFml). To quote Badiou himself, the UCFml is \\"the Maoist organization established in late 1969 by Natacha Michel, Sylvain Lazarus, myself and a fair number of young people\\". During this time, Badiou joined the faculty of the newly founded University of Paris VIII/Vincennes-Saint Denis which was a bastion of counter-cultural thought. There he engaged in fierce intellectual debates with fellow professors Gilles Deleuze and Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard, whose philosophical works he considered unhealthy deviations from the Althusserian program of a scientific Marxism. In the 1980s, as both Althusserian structural Marxism and Lacanian psychoanalysis went into decline (after Lacan died and Althusser was committed to a psychiatric hospital), Badiou published more technical and abstract philosophical works, such as Th√©orie du sujet (1982), and his magnum opus, Being and Event (1988). Nonetheless, Badiou has never renounced Althusser or Lacan, and sympathetic references to Marxism and psychoanalysis are not uncommon in his more recent works (most notably Petit panth√©on portatif / Pocket Pantheon).Badiou, Alain. \\"Jacques Lacan.\\" Pocket Pantheon. Trans. David Macey. London: Verso, 2009Badiou, Alain. \\"Louis Althusser.\\" Pocket Pantheon. Trans. David Macey. London: Verso, 2009 He took up his current position at the ENS in 1999. He is also associated with a number of other institutions, such as the Coll√®ge International de Philosophie. He was a member of \\"L'Organisation Politique\\" which, as mentioned above, he founded in 1985 with some comrades from the Maoist UCFml. This organization disbanded in 2007, according to the French Wikipedia article (linked to in the previous sentence). In 2002, he was a co- founder of the Centre International d'Etude de la Philosophie Fran√ßaise Contemporaine, alongside Yves Duroux and his former student Quentin Meillassoux. Badiou has also enjoyed success as a dramatist with plays such as Ahmed le Subtil. In the last decade, an increasing number of Badiou's works have been translated into English, such as Ethics, Deleuze, Manifesto for Philosophy, Metapolitics, and Being and Event. Short pieces by Badiou have likewise appeared in American and English periodicals, such as Lacanian Ink, New Left Review, Radical Philosophy, Cosmos and History and Parrhesia. Unusually for a contemporary European philosopher his work is increasingly being taken up by militants in countries like India, the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Africa. In 2014‚Äì15, Badiou had the role of Honorary President at The Global Center for Advanced Studies. Anti-Semitism accusation and response In 2005, a fierce controversy in Parisian intellectual life erupted after the publication of Badiou's Circonstances 3: Port√©es du mot 'juif' (\\"The Uses of the Word 'Jew'\\"). This book generated a strong response, and the wrangling became a cause c√©l√®bre with articles going back and forth in the French newspaper Le Monde and in the cultural journal Les Temps modernes. Linguist and Lacanian philosopher Jean-Claude Milner, a past president of Coll√®ge international de philosophie, accused Badiou of anti-Semitism.On that subject, see articles against Badiou by: * Roger-Pol Droit (\\"Le Monde des livres\\", 25 November 2005) and Fr√©d√©ric Nef (\\"Le Monde des livres\\", 23 December 2005), and in defense of Badiou by: Daniel Bensaid (\\"Le Monde des Livres\\", 26 January 2006); against Badiou by: * Claude Lanzmann, Jean-Claude Milner and Eric Marty (\\"Les Temps modernes\\", Nov.-December 2005/January 2006), and Meir Waintrater \\"L'Arche\\" February 2006: \\"Alain Badiou et les Juifs: Une violence insoutenable\\", and the answers by Alain Badiou and C√©cile Winter followed by rejoinders by Claude Lanzmann and Eric Marty (\\"Les Temps modernes\\", March‚ÄìJune 2006). See also Badiou's response to Eric Marty Badiou forcefully rebutted this charge, declaring that his accusers often conflate a nation-state with religious preference and will label as anti-Semitic anyone who objects to this tendency: \\"It is wholly intolerable to be accused of anti-Semitism by anyone for the sole reason that, from the fact of the extermination, one does not conclude as to the predicate \\"Jew\\" and its religious and communitarian dimension that it receive some singular valorization ‚Äî a transcendent annunciation! ‚Äî nor that Israeli exactions, whose colonial nature is patent and banal, be specially tolerated. I propose that nobody any longer accept, publicly or privately, this type of political blackmail.\\"Alain Badiou, Circonstances 3: Port√©es du mot 'juif', Paris: Leo Sch√©er, 2005 (The Uses of the Word 'Jew'), translated by Steve Corcoran. Accessed 22 November 2019. Badiou characterizes the state of Israel as \\"neither more nor less impure than all states\\", but objects to \\"its exclusive identitarian claim to be a Jewish state, and the way it draws incessant privileges from this claim, especially when it comes to trampling underfoot what serves us as international law.\\" For example, he continues, \\"The Islamic states are certainly no more progressive as models than the various versions of the 'Arab nation' were. Everyone agrees, it seems, on the point that the Taliban do not embody the path of modernity for Afghanistan.‚Äù A modern democracy, he writes, must count all its residents as citizens, and \\"there is no acceptable reason to exempt the state of Israel from that rule. The claim is sometimes made that this state is the only 'democratic' state in the region. But the fact that this state presents itself as a Jewish state is directly contradictory.\\" Badiou is optimistic that ongoing political problems can be resolved by de-emphasizing the communitarian religious dimension: \\"The signifier 'Palestinian' or 'Arab' should not be glorified any more than is permitted for the signifier 'Jew.' As a result, the legitimate solution to the Middle East conflict is not the dreadful institution of two barbed-wire states. The solution is the creation of a secular and democratic Palestine...which would show that it is perfectly possible to create a place in these lands where, from a political point of view and regardless of the apolitical continuity of customs, there is 'neither Arab nor Jew.' This will undoubtedly demand a regional Mandela.\\"  Key concepts  Badiou makes repeated use of several concepts throughout his philosophy. One of the aims of his thought is to show that his categories of truth are useful for any type of philosophical critique. Therefore, he uses them to interrogate art and history as well as ontology and scientific discovery. Johannes Thumfart argues that Badiou's philosophy can be regarded as a contemporary reinterpretation of Platonism. Conditions According to Badiou, philosophy is suspended from four conditions (art, love, politics, and science), each of them fully independent \\"truth procedures.\\" (For Badiou's notion of truth procedures, see below.) Badiou consistently maintains throughout his work (but most systematically in Manifesto for Philosophy) that philosophy must avoid the temptation to suture itself ('sew itself', that is, to hand over its entire intellectual effort) to any of these independent truth procedures. When philosophy does suture itself to one of its conditions (and Badiou argues that the history of philosophy during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is primarily a history of sutures), what results is a philosophical \\"disaster.\\" Consequently, philosophy is, according to Badiou, a thinking of the compossibility of the several truth procedures, whether this is undertaken through the investigation of the intersections between distinct truth procedures (the intersection of art and love in the novel, for instance), or whether this is undertaken through the more traditionally philosophical work of addressing categories like truth or the subject (concepts that are, as concepts, external to the individual truth procedures, though they are functionally operative in the truth procedures themselves). For Badiou, when philosophy addresses the four truth procedures in a genuinely philosophical manner, rather than through a suturing abandonment of philosophy as such, it speaks of them with a theoretical terminology that marks its philosophical character: \\"inaesthetics\\" rather than art; metapolitics rather than politics; ontology rather than science; etc. Truth, for Badiou, is a specifically philosophical category. While philosophy's several conditions are, on their own terms, \\"truth procedures\\" (i.e., they produce truths as they are pursued), it is only philosophy that can speak of the several truth procedures as truth procedures. (The lover, for instance, does not think of her love as a question of truth, but simply and rightly as a question of love. Only the philosopher sees in the true lover's love the unfolding of a truth.) Badiou has a very rigorous notion of truth, one that is strongly against the grain of much of contemporary European thought. Badiou at once embraces the traditional modernist notion that truths are genuinely invariant (always and everywhere the case, eternal and unchanging) and the incisively postmodernist notion that truths are constructed through processes. Badiou's theory of truth, exposited throughout his work, accomplishes this strange mixture by uncoupling invariance from self-evidence (such that invariance does not imply self- evidence), as well as by uncoupling constructedness from relativity (such that constructedness does not lead to relativism). The idea, here, is that a truth's invariance makes it genuinely indiscernible: because a truth is everywhere and always the case, it passes unnoticed unless there is a rupture in the laws of being and appearance, during which the truth in question becomes, but only for a passing moment, discernible. Such a rupture is what Badiou calls an event, according to a theory originally worked out in Being and Event and fleshed out in important ways in Logics of Worlds. The individual who chances to witness such an event, if he is faithful to what he has glimpsed, can then introduce the truth by naming it into worldly situations. For Badiou, it is by positioning oneself to the truth of an event that a human animal becomes a subject; subjectivity is not an inherent human trait. According to a process or procedure that subsequently unfolds only if those who subject themselves to the glimpsed truth continue to be faithful in the work of announcing the truth in question, genuine knowledge is produced (knowledge often appears in Badiou's work under the title of the \\"veridical\\"). While such knowledge is produced in the process of being faithful to a truth event, for Badiou, knowledge, in the figure of the encyclopedia, always remains fragile, subject to what may yet be produced as faithful subjects of the event produce further knowledge. According to Badiou, truth procedures proceed to infinity, such that faith (fidelity) outstrips knowledge. (Badiou, following both Lacan and Heidegger, distances truth from knowledge.) The dominating ideology of the day, which Badiou terms \\"democratic materialism,\\" denies the existence of truth and only recognizes \\"bodies\\" and \\"languages.\\" Badiou proposes a turn towards the \\"materialist dialectic,\\" which recognizes that there are only bodies and languages, except there are also truths. Inaesthetic In Handbook of Inaesthetics Badiou both draws on the original Greek meaning and the later Kantian concept of \\"aesthesis\\" as \\"material perception\\" and coins the phrase \\"inaesthetic\\" to refer to a concept of artistic creation that denies \\"the reflection/object relation\\" yet, at the same time, in reaction against the idea of mimesis, or poetic reflection of \\"nature\\", he affirms that art is \\"immanent\\" and \\"singular\\". Art is immanent in the sense that its truth is given in its immediacy in a given work of art, and singular in that its truth is found in art and art alone‚Äîhence reviving the ancient materialist concept of \\"aesthesis\\". His view of the link between philosophy and art is tied into the motif of pedagogy, which he claims functions so as to \\"arrange the forms of knowledge in a way that some truth may come to pierce a hole in them\\". He develops these ideas with examples from the prose of Samuel Beckett and the poetry of St√©phane Mallarm√© and Fernando Pessoa (who he argues has developed a body of work that philosophy is currently incapable of incorporating), among others. Being and Event The major propositions of Badiou's philosophy all find their basis in Being and Event, in which he continues his attempt (which he began in Th√©orie du sujet) to reconcile a notion of the subject with ontology, and in particular post- structuralist and constructivist ontologies.See here Feltham and Clamens's introduction in Badiou's book Infinite Thought, Continuum (2004) A frequent criticism of post-structuralist work is that it prohibits, through its fixation on semiotics and language, any notion of a subject. Badiou's work is, by his own admission,See Badiou's book Infinite Thought, Continuum (2004) an attempt to break out of contemporary philosophy's fixation upon language, which he sees almost as a straitjacket. This effort leads him, in Being and Event, to combine rigorous mathematical formulae with his readings of poets such as Mallarm√© and H√∂lderlin and religious thinkers such as Pascal. His philosophy draws upon both 'analytical' and 'continental' traditions. In Badiou's own opinion, this combination places him awkwardly relative to his contemporaries, meaning that his work had been only slowly taken up.See here Badiou's comments in the introduction to the English version of Being and Event, Continuum (2005) Being and Event offers an example of this slow uptake, in fact: it was translated into English only in 2005, a full seventeen years after its French publication. As is implied in the title of the book, two elements mark the thesis of Being and Event: the place of ontology, or 'the science of being qua being' (being in itself), and the place of the event ‚Äì which is seen as a rupture in being ‚Äì through which the subject finds realization and reconciliation with truth. This situation of being and the rupture which characterizes the event are thought in terms of set theory, and specifically Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory (with the axiom of choice), to which Badiou accords a fundamental role in a manner quite distinct from the majority of either mathematicians or philosophers. Mathematics as ontology For Badiou the problem which the Greek tradition of philosophy has faced and never satisfactorily dealt with is that while beings themselves are plural, and thought in terms of multiplicity, being itself is thought to be singular; that is, it is thought in terms of the one. He proposes as the solution to this impasse the following declaration: that the One is not (l'Un n'est pas). This is why Badiou accords set theory (the axioms of which he refers to as the \\"ideas of the multiple\\") such stature, and refers to mathematics as the very place of ontology: Only set theory allows one to conceive a 'pure doctrine of the multiple'. Set theory does not operate in terms of definite individual elements in groupings but only functions insofar as what belongs to a set is of the same relation as that set (that is, another set too). What individuates a set, therefore, is not an existential positive proposition, but other multiples whose properties (i.e., structural relations) validate its presentation. The structure of being thus secures the regime of the count-as- one. So if one is to think of a set ‚Äì for instance, the set of people, or humanity ‚Äì as counting as one, the multiple elements which belong to that set are secured as one consistent concept (humanity), but only in terms of what does not belong to that set. What is crucial for Badiou is that the structural form of the count-as-one, which makes multiplicities thinkable, implies (somehow or other) that the proper name of being does not belong to an element as such (an original 'one'), but rather the void set (written √ò), the set to which nothing (not even the void set itself) belongs. It may help to understand the concept 'count-as-one' if it is associated with the concept of 'terming': a multiple is not one, but it is referred to with 'multiple': one word. To count a set as one is to mention that set. How the being of terms such as 'multiple' does not contradict the non-being of the one can be understood by considering the multiple nature of terminology: for there to be a term without there also being a system of terminology, within which the difference between terms gives context and meaning to any one term, is impossible. 'Terminology' implies precisely difference between terms (thus multiplicity) as the condition for meaning. The idea of a term without meaning is incoherent, the count-as-one is a structural effect or a situational operation; it is not an event of 'truth'. Multiples which are 'composed' or 'consistent' are count-effects. 'Inconsistent multiplicity' [meaning?] is [somehow or other] 'the presentation of presentation.' Badiou's use of set theory in this manner is not just illustrative or heuristic. Badiou uses the axioms of Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory to identify the relationship of being to history, Nature, the State, and God. Most significantly this use means that (as with set theory) there is a strict prohibition on self-belonging; a set cannot contain or belong to itself. This results from the axiom of foundation ‚Äì or the axiom of regularity ‚Äì which enacts such a prohibition (cf. p. 190 in Being and Event). (This axiom states that every non-empty set A contains an element y that is disjoint from A.) Badiou's philosophy draws two major implications from this prohibition. Firstly, it secures the inexistence of the 'one': there cannot be a grand overarching set, and thus it is fallacious to conceive of a grand cosmos, a whole Nature, or a Being of God. Badiou is therefore ‚Äì against Georg Cantor, from whom he draws heavily ‚Äì staunchly atheist. However, secondly, this prohibition prompts him to introduce the event. Because, according to Badiou, the axiom of foundation 'founds' all sets in the void, it ties all being to the historico-social situation of the multiplicities of de-centred sets ‚Äì thereby effacing the positivity of subjective action, or an entirely 'new' occurrence. And whilst this is acceptable ontologically, it is unacceptable, Badiou holds, philosophically. Set theory mathematics has consequently 'pragmatically abandoned' an area which philosophy cannot. And so, Badiou argues, there is therefore only one possibility remaining: that ontology can say nothing about the event. Several critics have questioned Badiou's use of mathematics. Mathematician Alan Sokal and physicist Jean Bricmont write that Badiou proposes, with seemingly \\"utter seriousness,\\" a blending of psychoanalysis, politics and set theory that they contend is preposterous.Sokal, Alan and Jean Bricmont (1999) Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of Science Macmillan, , p. 180 Similarly, philosopher Roger Scruton has questioned Badiou's grasp of the foundation of mathematics, writing in 2012: :There is no evidence that I can find in Being and Event that the author really understands what he is talking about when he invokes (as he constantly does) Georg Cantor's theory of transfinite cardinals, the axioms of set theory, G√∂del's incompleteness proof or Paul Cohen's proof of the independence of the continuum hypothesis. When these things appear in Badiou's texts it is always allusively, with fragments of symbolism detached from the context that endows them with sense, and often with free variables and bound variables colliding randomly. No proof is clearly stated or examined, and the jargon of set theory is waved like a magician's wand, to give authority to bursts of all but unintelligible metaphysics. An example of a critique from a mathematician's point of view is the essay 'Badiou's Number: A Critique of Mathematics as Ontology' by Ricardo L. Nirenberg and David Nirenberg, which takes issue in particular with Badiou's matheme of the Event in Being and Event, which has already been alluded to in respect of the 'axiom of foundation' above. Nirenberg and Nirenberg write: :Rather than being defined in terms of objects previously defined, ex is here defined in terms of itself; you must already have it in order to define it. Set theorists call this a not-well-founded set. This kind of set never appears in mathematics‚Äînot least because it produces an unmathematical mise-en-ab√Æme: if we replace ex inside the bracket by its expression as a bracket, we can go on doing this forever‚Äîand so can hardly be called \\"a matheme.\\"' The event and the subject Badiou again turns here to mathematics and set theory ‚Äì Badiou's language of ontology ‚Äì to study the possibility of an indiscernible element existing extrinsically to the situation of ontology. He employs the strategy of the mathematician Paul J. Cohen, using what are called the conditions of sets. These conditions are thought of in terms of domination, a domination being that which defines a set. (If one takes, in binary language, the set with the condition 'items marked only with ones', any item marked with zero negates the property of the set. The condition which has only ones is thus dominated by any condition which has zeros in it [cf. pp. 367‚Äì71 in Being and Event].) Badiou reasons using these conditions that every discernible (nameable or constructible) set is dominated by the conditions which don't possess the property that makes it discernible as a set. (The property 'one' is always dominated by 'not one'.) These sets are, in line with constructible ontology, relative to one's being- in-the-world and one's being in language (where sets and concepts, such as the concept 'humanity', get their names). However, he continues, the dominations themselves are, whilst being relative concepts, not necessarily intrinsic to language and constructible thought; rather one can axiomatically define a domination ‚Äì in the terms of mathematical ontology ‚Äì as a set of conditions such that any condition outside the domination is dominated by at least one term inside the domination. One does not necessarily need to refer to constructible language to conceive of a 'set of dominations', which he refers to as the indiscernible set, or the generic set. It is therefore, he continues, possible to think beyond the strictures of the relativistic constructible universe of language, by a process Cohen calls forcing. And he concludes in following that while ontology can mark out a space for an inhabitant of the constructible situation to decide upon the indiscernible, it falls to the subject ‚Äì about which the ontological situation cannot comment ‚Äì to nominate this indiscernible, this generic point; and thus nominate, and give name to, the undecidable event. Badiou thereby marks out a philosophy by which to refute the apparent relativism or apoliticism in post-structuralist thought. Badiou's ultimate ethical maxim is therefore one of: 'decide upon the undecidable'. It is to name the indiscernible, the generic set, and thus name the event that re-casts ontology in a new light. He identifies four domains in which a subject (who, it is important to note, becomes a subject through this process) can potentially witness an event: love, science, politics and art. By enacting fidelity to the event within these four domains one performs a 'generic procedure', which in its undecidability is necessarily experimental, and one potentially recasts the situation in which being takes place. Through this maintenance of fidelity, truth has the potentiality to emerge. In line with his concept of the event, Badiou maintains, politics is not about politicians, but activism based on the present situation and the (his translators' neologism) rupture. So too does love have this characteristic of becoming anew. Even in science the guesswork that marks the event is prominent. He vigorously rejects the tag of 'decisionist' (the idea that once something is decided it 'becomes true'), but rather argues that the recasting of a truth comes prior to its veracity or verifiability. As he says of Galileo (p. 401): :When Galileo announced the principle of inertia, he was still separated from the truth of the new physics by all the chance encounters that are named in subjects such as Descartes or Newton. How could he, with the names he fabricated and displaced (because they were at hand ‚Äì 'movement', 'equal proportion', etc.), have supposed the veracity of his principle for the situation to-come that was the establishment of modern science; that is, the supplementation of his situation with the indiscernible and unfinishable part that one has to name 'rational physics'? While Badiou is keen to reject an equivalence between politics and philosophy, he correlates nonetheless his political activism and skepticism toward the parliamentary-democratic process with his philosophy, based around singular, situated truths, and potential revolutions. L'Organisation Politique Alain Badiou is a founding member (along with Natacha Michel and Sylvain Lazarus) of the militant French political organisation L'Organisation Politique, which was active from 1985 until it disbanded in 2007.See the organisation's website at https://web.archive.org/web/20071028083920/http://www.orgapoli.net/ It called itself a post-party organization concerned with direct popular intervention in a wide range of issues (including immigration, labor, and housing). In addition to numerous writings and interventions, L'Organisation Politique highlighted the importance of developing political prescriptions concerning undocumented migrants (les sans papiers), stressing that they must be conceived primarily as workers and not immigrants. Sarkozy pamphlet Alain Badiou gained great notoriety in 2007 with his pamphlet The Meaning of Sarkozy (De quoi Sarkozy est-il le nom?), which quickly sold 60,000 copies, whereas for 40 years the sales of his books had oscillated between 2,000 and 6,000 copies.Eric Conan, \\"Badiou, la star de la philo est-il un salaud?\\", in Marianne no. 671, 27 Feb 2010, p. 18.

Later in the year some of these were also surcharged with values from 1 centime to 5 francs. By the end of the year, a supply of the omnibus Navigation and Commerce issues became available, inscribed OBOCK in red or blue. 1893 and 1894 brought the stamps for which Obock is most famous among philatelists: a series of imperforate stamps with simulated perforations, a scalloped line resembling the outline of a perforated stamps, printed all around the design. In addition, the 2-franc and higher denomination stamps are in the shape of a large equilateral triangle. While the low values are relatively common, the triangular stamps are more scarce. Although with the departure of the government from Obock, it is hard to believe that much mail came or went from the little port town, used stamps are no more valuable than unused.

Wall Drug consists of a collection of cowboy-themed stores, including a drug store, gift shop, several restaurants, and various other stores, as well as an art gallery and an 80-foot (24 m) brontosaurus sculpture. Unlike a traditional shopping mall, all the stores at Wall Drug operate under a single entity rather than being run individually. The New York Times has described Wall Drug as \\"a sprawling tourist attraction of international renown [that] draws some two million annual visitors to a remote town.\\" History Wall Drug historic display, including items from Hustead's early practice The small town drugstore made its first step towards fame when it was purchased by Ted Hustead in 1931. Hustead was a Nebraska native and pharmacist who was looking for a small town with a Catholic church in which to establish his business. He bought Wall Drug, located in a 231-person town in what he referred to as \\"the middle of nowhere,\\" and strove to make a living. Business was very slow until his wife, Dorothy, thought of advertising free ice water to parched travelers heading to the newly opened Mount Rushmore monument to the west. From that time on business was brisk. Wall Drug grew into a cowboy-themed mall and department store. Wall Drug includes a western art museum, a chapel based on the one found at New Melleray Abbey near Dubuque, Iowa, and an brontosaurus that can be seen right off Interstate 90. It was designed by Emmet Sullivan who also created the dinosaurs at Dinosaur Park in Rapid City and Dinosaur World in Arkansas. Marketing campaign Wall Drug earns much of its fame from its self-promotion. Billboards advertising the establishment can be seen for hundreds of miles throughout South Dakota and the neighboring states. In addition, many visitors of Wall Drug have erected signs throughout the world announcing the miles to Wall Drug from famous locations. By 1981 Wall Drug was claiming it was giving away 20,000 cups of water per day during the peak tourist season, lasting from Memorial Day until Labor Day, and during the hottest days of the summer. Most of Wall Drug's advertisement billboards can be found on an approximately stretch of Interstate 90 from Minnesota to Billings, Montana. The signs are created by South Dakota billboard artists, including Dobby Hansen and Barry Knutson of Philip.  Today  Wall Drug dinosaur model To date, Wall Drug still offers free ice water, but as they have become more popular, they have started to offer free bumper stickers to aid in promotion, and coffee for 5 cents. Some popular free bumper stickers read \\"Where the heck is Wall Drug?\\" and \\"Have You Dug Wall Drug?\\". Wall Drug has over 300 original oil paintings in the Western art Gallery Dining Rooms. This acquisition represents one of the best private collections of original Western and Illustration Art in the country. Artists featured include N. C. Wyeth, Harvey Dunn, Dean Cornwell, Louis Glanzman, and Harold Von Schmidt. When the United States Air Force was still operating Minuteman missile silos in the western South Dakota plains, Wall Drug used to offer free coffee and doughnuts to service personnel if they stopped in on their way to or from Ellsworth Air Force Base ( west on Interstate 90). Wall Drug still offers free coffee and donuts to active military personnel. Ted Hustead died in 1999. The following day, South Dakota Governor Bill Janklow began his annual State of the State address by commemorating Hustead as \\"a guy that figured out that free ice water could turn you into a phenomenal success in the middle of a semi-arid desert way out in the middle of someplace.\\"  Media references  *In 1981, Wall Drug was featured in Time magazine as one of the largest tourist attractions in the north. *In his 1989 book The Lost Continent, Bill Bryson wrote, \\"It's an awful place, one of the world's worst tourist traps, but I loved it and I won't have a word said against it.\\" *The history of Wall Drug was told in a two-episode story arc of the podcast The Radio Adventures of Dr. Floyd. *In 2016 Z Nation featured Wall Drug in season 3, episode 8.

The bill was passed by the 85th United States Congress and signed into law by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on September 9, 1957. The Supreme Court's 1954 ruling in the case of Brown v. Board of Education brought the issue of school desegregation to the fore of public attention, as Southern leaders began a campaign of \\"massive resistance\\" against desegregation. In the midst of this campaign, President Eisenhower proposed a civil rights bill designed to provide federal protection for African-American voting rights; most African Americans in the Southern United States had been effectively disenfranchised by various state and local laws. Though the civil rights bill passed Congress, opponents of the act were able to remove several provisions, limiting its immediate impact. During the debate over the law, Senator Strom Thurmond conducted the longest one-person filibuster in Senate history. Despite having a limited impact on African-American voter participation, the Civil Rights Act of 1957 did establish the United States Commission on Civil Rights and the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division. Congress would later pass far more effective civil rights laws in the form of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  Background  Following the Supreme Court ruling in Brown, which eventually led to the integration, also called desegregation, of public schools, Southern whites began a campaign of \\"Massive Resistance.\\" Violence against black people rose; in Little Rock, Arkansas where President Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered U.S. paratroopers of the 101st Airborne Division to protect nine black teenagers integrating into a public school, the first time federal troops were deployed in the South to settle civil rights issues since the Reconstruction Era.James A. Miller, \\"An inside look at Eisenhower's civil rights record\\" The Boston Globe at boston.com, 21 November 2007, accessed 28 October 2011 There had been continued physical assaults against suspected activists and bombings of schools and churches in the South. Partly in an effort to defuse calls for more far-reaching reforms, President Eisenhower proposed a civil rights bill that would increase the protection of African American voting rights. By 1957, only about 20% of blacks were registered to vote. Despite being the majority in numerous counties and congressional districts in the South, most blacks had been effectively disfranchised by discriminatory voter registration rules and laws in those states since the late 19th and early 20th centuries that were heavily instituted and propagated by Southern Democrats. Civil rights organizations had collected evidence of discriminatory practices, such as the administration of literacy and comprehension tests and poll taxes. While the states had the right to establish rules for voter registration and elections, the federal government found an oversight role in ensuring that citizens could exercise the constitutional right to vote for federal officers: electors for president and vice president and members of the US Congress. Legislative history President Dwight D. Eisenhower signing the Civil Rights Act of 1957 on September 9, 1957. The Democratic Senate Majority Leader, Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas, realized that the bill and its journey through Congress could tear apart his party, as southern Democrats vehemently opposed civil rights, and its northern members were strongly in favor of them. Southern Democratic senators occupied chairs of numerous important committees because of their long seniority. As, in the near-century between the end of Reconstruction and the 1960s, white Southerners voted solidly as a bloc for the Democrats, Southern Democrats in Congress rarely lost their seats in elections, ensuring that they had more seniority than Democratic members of Congress from other parts of the country. Johnson sent the bill to the Senate Judiciary Committee, led by Democratic Senator James Eastland of Mississippi, who drastically altered the bill. Democratic Senator Richard Russell, Jr., of Georgia had denounced the bill as an example of the federal government seeking to impose its laws on states. Johnson sought recognition from civil rights advocates for passing the bill as well as recognition from the anti-civil rights Democrats for weakening the bill so much as to make it toothless.Caro, Robert, Master of the Senate: The Years of Lyndon Johnson, Chapter 39 The bill passed 285-126 in the House of Representatives with a majority of both parties' support (Republicans 167‚Äì19, Democrats 118‚Äì107) It then passed 72-18 in the Senate, again with a majority of both parties (Republicans 43‚Äì0, Democrats 29‚Äì18). President Eisenhower signed the bill on September 9, 1957.  Filibuster  Then-Democratic Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, an ardent segregationist, sustained the longest one-person filibuster in history in an attempt to keep the bill from becoming law.Senate.gov web site His one-man filibuster lasted 24 hours and 18 minutes; he began with readings of every US state's election laws in alphabetical order. He later read from the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, and George Washington's Farewell Address. To prevent a quorum call that could have relieved the filibuster by allowing the Senate to adjourn, cots were brought in from a nearby hotel for the legislators to sleep on while Thurmond discussed increasingly irrelevant and obscure topics. Other Southern senators, who had agreed as part of a compromise not to filibuster this bill, were upset with Thurmond. They believed his defiance made them look incompetent to their constituents. Other constituents were upset with their senators because they were seen as not helping Thurmond.Caro, Robert (2002). Master of the Senate: The Years of Lyndon Johnson. New York: Knopf. . Thurmond pointed out that there was already a federal statute that prosecuted citizens who denied or intimidated voters at voting booths under a fine and/or imprisonment but that the bill then under consideration could legally deny trial by jury to those that continued to do so. Democratic Representative Charles A. Boyle of Illinois, a member of the powerful Appropriations Subcommittee of Defense, pushed the bill through the House of Representatives. Parts Part I‚Äîestablishment of Commission on Civil Rights Section 101 set up a six- member Civil Rights Commission in the executive branch to gather information on citizens' deprivation of voting rights based on color, race, religion, or national origin as well as the legal background, the laws, and the policies of the federal government. The commission was to take testimony or written complaints from individuals on the difficulties in registering and voting. It would submit a final report to the President and the Congress within two years and then cease to exist. Part II‚Äîadditional assistant attorney general Part III‚Äîstrengthen civil rights statutes and other purposes Part IV‚Äîfurther securing and protecting the right to vote Part IV, Section 131, banned intimidating, coercing or otherwise interfering with the rights of persons to vote for electors for President and members of Congress. The United States Attorney General was allowed to institute actions, including injunctions and charges of contempt of court, with fines not to exceed $1,000 and six months imprisonment. Extensive safeguards for the rights of accused were provided by the statute. US federal judges were allowed to hear cases related to the Act with or without juries. Not being able to vote in most of the South, blacks were then excluded from state juries there. Federal jury selection had been tied to state jury selection rules, thus in some instances excluding both blacks and women as federal jurors. Section 161 freed federal courts from state jury rules and specified qualifications for jurors in federal courts. \\"Any citizen\\" 21 years or older, literate in English, who had resided in the judicial district for a year, excluding convicts and persons with mental or physical infirmities severe enough to make them unable to serve, was eligible. Since neither race nor sex was listed among the qualifications, the provision allowed both blacks and women to serve on juries in trials in federal courts. Part V‚Äîprovide trial by jury and to amend the judicial code The final version of the act established both the Commission on Civil Rights and the office of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. Subsequently, on December 9, 1957, the Civil Rights Division was established within the Justice Department by order of US Attorney General William P. Rogers, giving the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights a distinct division to command. Previously, civil rights lawyers had enforced Reconstruction-era civil rights laws from within the Department's Criminal Division. Amendments The Civil Rights Act of 1960 addressed some of the shortcomings of the 1957 Act by expanding the authority of federal judges to protect voting rights and by requiring local authorities to maintain comprehensive voting records for review so that the government could determine if there were patterns of discrimination against certain populations.Civil Rights Act of 1960 The Civil Rights Movement continued to expand, with protesters leading nonviolent demonstrations to mark their cause. As president, John F. Kennedy called for a new bill in his televised Civil Rights Address of June 11, 1963, in which he asked for legislation \\"giving all Americans the right to be served in facilities which are open to the public‚Äîhotels, restaurants, theaters, retail stores, and similar establishments\\" as well as \\"greater protection for the right to vote.\\" Kennedy delivered the speech after a series of civil rights protests, most notably the Birmingham campaign, which concluded in May 1963. In the summer of 1963, various parts of the civil rights movement collaborated to run voter education and voter registration drives in Mississippi. During the 1964 Freedom Summer, hundreds of students from the North and West came to participate in voter drives and community organizing. Media coverage, especially of the violent backlash exemplified by the murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner near Philadelphia, Mississippi, contributed to national support for civil rights legislation. After the Kennedy assassination, President Lyndon Johnson helped secure passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which made racial discrimination and segregation illegal, as well as the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which abolished the poll tax and other means of keeping blacks and the poor from registering to vote and from voting, established record-keeping and oversight, and provided for federal enforcement in areas with documented patterns of discrimination or low voter turnout. Legacy Although the Act's passage seemed to indicate a growing federal commitment to the cause of civil rights, the legislation was limited. Alterations to the bill made the Act difficult to enforce; by 1960, black voting had increased by only 3%. Its passage showed varying degrees of willingness to support civil rights. The Act restricted itself to protecting participation in federal elections. Martin Luther King Jr., then 28, was a developing leader in the Civil Rights Movement and spoke out against white supremacists. Segregationists had burned black churches, which were centers of education and organizing for voter registration, and physically attacked black activists, including women. King sent a telegram to Eisenhower to make a speech to the South and asked him to use \\"the weight of your great office to point out to the people of the South the moral nature of the problem.\\" Eisenhower responded, \\"I don't know what another speech would do about the thing right now.\\" Disappointed, King sent another telegram to Eisenhower stating that the latter's comments were \\"a profound disappointment to the millions of Americans of goodwill, north and south, who earnestly are looking to you for leadership and guidance in this period of inevitable social change.\\" He tried to set up a meeting with the President but was given a two-hour meeting with Vice President Richard Nixon. It is reported that Nixon was impressed with King and told Eisenhower that he might enjoy meeting King later.Nichols, David. A. (2007).

He is a master of every form of martial arts to have been developed by the 31st century. The extent of his skill is so great that he can severely damage various types of hard material with a single blow and was briefly able to hold his own against Superboy through use of what he called \\"Super Karate\\". Publication history Karate Kid first appeared in Adventure Comics #346 (July 1966) and was created by Jim Shooter. The character appeared in Shooter's first published story, along with other new members of the Legion of Super-Heroes: Princess Projectra, Ferro Lad and Nemesis Kid. Fictional character biography Val Armorr was the son of one of Japan's greatest crime lords, Kirau Nezumi, also known as Black Dragon. When he was born, his mother, the American secret agent Valentina Armorr, tried to hide him from his father, but she failed and was killed for her effort. Japan's greatest hero Sensei Toshiaki (the White Crane) eventually killed Black Dragon for his crimes and adopted the infant Val. He raised Val as if he were his own son, and trained him in all manner of the martial arts. Val became the youngest warrior ever to earn the title Samurai, and he went to work for his local shogun. However, after trying his best and failing to please his supervisor, he quit and searched the galaxy for new forms of battle to master. Legion of Super- Heroes When Val returned to Earth, he found that the Legion of Super-Heroes was searching for new recruits to battle the Khunds. He applied, and, although he had no superhuman powers, was accepted when he challenged Superboy to single combat and so impressed the Boy of Steel with his unexpectedly formidable skill that Superboy vouched for his admission to the Legion. His Legion career almost ended ignominiously when fellow recruit Nemesis Kid framed him for betraying Earth to the Khunds, but Nemesis Kid's own treachery was discovered in time, and Val went on to become one of the greatest Legionnaires ever. As Karate Kid, Val was the Legion's leader for one termVal's term as leader began in Adventure Comics #382, November 1969, and ended with the first term of Mon-El in Adventure Comics #392, September 1970. and once took on the entire Fatal Five single-handedly, clearly defeating the Persuader, Emerald Empress, and Mano (though Mano was largely a matter of luck as the Kid admitted to himself). At one point or another he launched solo flying kicks at villains whose power level far exceeded Superboy, including Validus, Mordru, Omega and even Darkseid. Though they had little effect, they showed the degree of his fearless courage. Karate Kid's best friends in the Legion were Timber Wolf, Chamelon Boy, Dawnstar and Ferro Lad. Timber Wolf's acrobatic abilities made him a natural sparring partner against Val and Karate Kid had a calming effect on Brin Londo with his discipline. Val fell in love with Princess Projectra, who joined the Legion at the same time he did. In order to prove his worthiness of the princess' hand, he took a leave of absence and spent about a year in the primitive 20th century (during his visit there, Karate Kid was featured in an eponymous, short-lived comic book series: Karate Kid #1 debuted in March 1976 and lasted for 15 issues). He returned to find Projectra's father dead. With Val's and the other Legionnaires' help, she won the throne from her cousin Pharoxx. Val officially became Projectra's consort soon afterward and resigned from the Legion. Wedded bliss did not last long. He and Projectra returned from their honeymoon to find that her planet, Orando, had been taken over by the Legion of Super-Villains. Val, Projectra, and several other Legionnaires were captured by the villains. When the heroes escaped to oppose the villains, Val fought their leader, Nemesis Kid. Nemesis Kid beat Val almost to death, and Val wanted to continue to fight so that he could die in battle ‚Äî the ultimate honor by his cultural standards. But at Projectra's urging, Val instead used his remaining strength to destroy the power source for the machines that were moving Orando into a strange dimension. In revenge, Projectra killed Nemesis Kid soon afterward. A memorial to Val was built on Shanghalla. Myg of Lythyl, one of that planet's Three Judges, later applied for Legion membership and dedicated himself to carrying on the name of \\"Karate Kid.\\" Like his predecessor, he possessed superior martial arts skills. He became a member of the second Legion of Substitute Heroes while training in the Legion Academy. Myg later joined the Legion during the \\"Five Year Gap\\", the gap in-between Legion books before he resigned. During the \\"Five Years Later\\" storyline following the Magic Wars, Earth fell under the covert control of the Dominators, and withdrew from the United Planets. A few years later, the members of the Dominators' highly classified \\"Batch SW6\\" escaped captivity. Originally, Batch SW6 appeared to be a group of teenage Legionnaire clones, created from samples apparently taken just prior to Ferro Lad's death at the hands of the Sun-Eater. Later, they were revealed to be time-paradox duplicates, every bit as legitimate as their older counterparts. However, this version of Val Armorr was killed in battle (along with SW6's Princess Projectra and Chameleon Boy) fighting Dominion troops. Myg, however, resurfaced as one of the many people mindwiped by the Dominators. They unlocked his meta-gene, giving him sonic abilities.Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 4, #40 (February 1993) In his 2007 return in Justice League of America, Starman (Starboy) refers to Val having previously died without elaborating on how he returned from death. 1994 reboot Post-Zero Hour Karate Kid. Art by Alan Davis. In 1994, the Legion of Super-Heroes was restarted with a new history. In this version, Karate Kid was very much alive and had dedicated his life to mastering as many different forms of fighting as he can. To this end, he joined Leland McCauley's Workforce as Karate Kid to have the opportunity to travel to different planets and learn new disciplines, despite the knowledge that McCauley's values were far different from his own. He was able to live with those differences until McCauley attempted to profit from an anomaly in space which, to Val, represented something purely beautiful, like divine creation. Unable to reconcile his employment with his conscience any longer, he destroyed McCauley's anomaly-tapping machine and fled, and McCauley's men chased him, almost killing him. He asked for the Legion's protection, and they provided it, and, in a deal they worked out with McCauley, McCauley renounced any claim against Val, and Karate Kid became a Legionnaire. After the Legion disbanded, Val chose to study the Haplashar pacifists on the planet Steeple. What he did not foresee, however, was that this world would be cut off from the rest of the galaxy for ten years because of black hole activity. As they were preparing to leave, Steeple came under attack by Nadir. Ferro took a critical blow from Nadir and Val was forced to choose to stay on Steeple to tend to Ferro's health. They missed the window and were stranded on Steeple. When Brainiac 5 finally found a moment, he set about trying to establish a stargate to retrieve Val and Ferro from Steeple. This plan succeeded and they were rescued by Shikari and Sensor amidst the Legion's battle with Universo, and helped turn the tide. Afterwards, Val escorted Universo to Steeple, where the Halpashar agreed to watch over the villain (now forced into a sort of \\"mental coma\\"). After this Legion's timeline was destroyed in the Teen Titans/Legion Special they remained in limbo until retrieved to fight alongside the original Legion and the Threeboot Legion in Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds. There, Val Armorr met and fought alongside the Threeboot Karate Kid. Afterwards, the post-Zero Hour Legion, under the guidance of Shikari Lonestar, takes the name \\"the Wanderers\\" and decides to travel the Multiverse to look for survivors from the various alternate universes that were destroyed. 2005 reboot Threeboot Karate Kid. Art by Barry Kitson. In 2005, Legion history was again erased and restarted. In this version, Val Armorr was initially depicted with more Asian features, although he now appears to have predominantly Caucasian features.Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 5, #37 (February 2008) Still a master of many varied disciplines of martial arts, he is the Legion's most skilled fighter. Although initially drawn to Shadow Lass, who possesses a similar warrior spirit, after he and Tasmia broke up, he harbored a one-sided infatuation with Phantom Girl. Karate Kid is slowly teaching the headstrong Ultra Boy how to focus his powers, and in fact regularly teaches all core Legion members self-defense techniques. He and Light Lass became close after spending the night with one another. On Velmar V, the Ikonns overtook the planet's rulers, the Peril Men. When the S.P.s intervened, the Young Heroes were captured and the Legion attempted a rescue. While there, Karate Kid and Triplicate Girl were recruited for a strange mission by visitors from another time. Karate Kid and Triplicate Girl left with these strangers, with Val leaving behind a sign reading \\"OKKK.\\" How he returned to the team is unknown, but Val was shown back with the Legion for the Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds miniseries, where he met the post- Zero Hour Karate Kid. One Year Later and Countdown In Justice League of America vol. 2, #7, the villain known as Trident was revealed to really be Val Armorr from the pre-Crisis Legion. In issue #8, he battles Black Lightning and Batman while deep in the Batcave. During the fight, Superman's files are shown listing Val as a Class 15 fighter and Batman as a Class 12. Val is stopped when blasted by Black Lightning while Batman distracts him. Karate Kid and Starman are two of seven Legionnaires currently in the present. However, this Karate Kid bears little resemblance to the one currently featured in the 2005 reboot, in both physical features and costume, instead closely resembling the pre-Crisis version of the character. Starman (the adult Star Boy) mentions that Val once died, which is consistent with the character's pre-Crisis history.Justice League of America vol. 2, #10 (August 2007) When being interrogated by Batman, Karate Kid, still disoriented, identifies himself as \\"Wes Holloway, a member of the Trident Guild\\". The name is a direct allusion to the protagonist of Brad Meltzer's latest novel, The Book of Fate. He is teased within the narrative of Countdown about his heroic identity being inspired by the Karate Kid film.Countdown #49 (May 23, 2007) When other Legionnaires, except for Starman, return to their own time, Val remains behind in the 21st century. In Countdown #38, he and Triplicate Girl, now known as \\"Una\\", visit Barbara Gordon, where it revealed that Val is dying. They are sent to see a Mr. Orr, who declares that he has the answers they seek. Upon arriving at Orr's compound, Karate Kid briefly battles Equus, until Orr arrives on the scene, and tells them that Karate Kid's illness is similar to the OMAC virus. Under the order of Desaad, a lackey of Darkseid, Orr tells them to visit Buddy Blank in Colorado. Equus and a misunderstanding with the cops and Supergirl delays the trip. Val then meets Buddy Blank and his grandson, who take them to see Brother Eye. The entity scans Val, informing him that he is infected by the \\"Morticoccus\\" virus, and directs the group to what was once Bl√ºdhaven. Brother Eye had detected a similar strain there. In Bl√ºdhaven, the group encounters the Atomic Knights and Firestorm. When Val's sickness reaches breaking point, Brother Eye frees itself, and travels to Bl√ºdhaven, turning it into its new base, and uses the Atomic Knights and Firestorm as power sources. He's later brought on Apokolips, as Brother Eye intended to assimilate the Morticoccus during Apokolips' assimilation. As the attempts fail, Brother Eye is forced to assimilate Una instead, having her carry Val inside himself for vivisection. As Brother Eye is defeated, both Val and Una are freed, but Val is now grievously wounded, with Una pleading for his life as the other assembled heroes consider the idea of killing him before the virus spreads. When the group arrives on another of the 52 Earths, Val is taken to Project Cadmus and dies as Dubbilex examines him.Countdown to Final Crisis #7 (March 12, 2008) During the autopsy, the Morticoccus is released, and spreads its infection into the air. Because of assimilating Val's 31st- century blood, it is practically immune to any form of treatment. The bodies of Val and Una are eventually discovered by the Gotham City Police Department on New Earth, and Superman and the visiting Lightning Lad mourn their death. It is later revealed that their bodies were planted there by the Time Trapper. Val Armorr returned to the realm of the living again in the 2010 Legion of Super-Heroes series. He was last seen back with his wife Jeckie on their way to help the Legion against the Fatal Five.Legion of Super-Heroes #22 (July 17, 2013) 2019 reboot The latest version of Karate Kid is yet again a martial arts master and a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes. Solo series The pre-Crisis on Infinite Earths Karate Kid was featured in a 15-issue ongoing series, cover dated March/April 1976 through July/August 1978. It was written primarily by Barry JamesonKarate Kid #2 (May/June 1976) at the Grand Comics Database and Bob Rozakis, with pencils by Ric Estrada and Juan Ortiz. As the series begins, Karate Kid begins a long sojourn in the past on 20th century Earth, to prove to King Voxv of Orando that he is worthy of Princess Projectra's hand in marriage. While in the past, he meets and befriends schoolteacher Iris Jacobs, and encounters teen heroes Superboy and Robin. He battles numerous villains, including Nemesis Kid, Major Disaster and the Lord of Time. Eventually, he returns to the 30th century, just in time to assist his fellow Legionnaires during the Earthwar.Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes #244 (October 1978) It is not certain which events from this series have been incorporated into post-Infinite Crisis continuity. However, since most of the 21st century heroes were unfamiliar with Karate Kid in \\"The Lightning Saga\\" story arc and the Countdown to Final Crisis limited series, it is quite possible that none of the events from the Karate Kid series are canonical at this time. Powers and abilities A \\"living weapon\\", Karate Kid is considered the greatest martial artist of all time. Karate Kid is the master of every documented form of martial arts to have been developed up to the 31st century. He possesses the ability to sense the weakest spot in objects and people and his skill in hand-to-hand combat is seemingly superhuman, allowing him to simulate super-strength blows. He can severely damage extremely hard and strong materials ‚Äî metals, stone, etc. ‚Äî with a single blow. Karate Kid is also a master with all forms of melee weapons (he was the youngest warrior ever to earn the title samurai), though he dislikes using them and rarely needs to employ them. He occasionally fights Supergirl, though he is regularly beaten by her. This is presumably due to her training by the Amazons of Themyscira to learn to better control her super powers. As Val is male, he is denied Amazon training, making it one of the few skills he has not completely mastered. He fights Supergirl in an attempt to pick up some of those skills secondhand. Karate Kid's training included mental discipline which makes him more resistant to mind control, as well as giving him a limited control of his body's functions. This allows him to shut out and ignore physical pain; in one story, he nearly died due to this training when he unconsciously shut out the pain of a knife wound and only collapsed hours later, unaware of the injury and almost dying from it. Equipment As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes he is provided a Legion Flight Ring. It allows him to fly and protects him from the vacuum of space and other dangerous environments. Karate Kid combines his skills with his Legion Flight Ring, mastering his own style of aerial combat. Karate Kid kept an extensive collection of weapons in his Legion quarters, including many bladed weapons, which he was also skilled in using (Legion by-laws did not allow members who relied solely on weapons of any kind, but his were excepted as it was only a private collection). The Kid seldom used weapons when facing his opponents, but he once defeated a super-powered android designed to negate his hand-to- hand skills by using an improvised b≈ç staff.

Despite defeating Superman in one-on- one battle (by throwing him out of a ring and causing a disqualification, rather than through physical force), his lack of a superpower meant he was initially given menial chores around the ship and later kicked out of the Legion for trying to take down Grimbor without back-up. He was later reinstated when he was able to defeat Grimbor while the other Legionnaires were temporarily de-powered. * Val is mentioned in The CW series Supergirl by Querl \\"Brainy\\" Dox / Brainiac 5 as a friend of his back in the 31st century and a fellow member of the Legion of Superheroes.

For the post-Zero Hour/pre-Threeboot version, see Sensor. Princess Projectra is a fictional character, a superheroine in the DC Comics universe. Typically portrayed as a haughty member of an alien royal family, she lives in the 30th and 31st centuries, and is a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes. Projectra was one of Jim Shooter's early creations on Legion of Super Heroes that helped cement his place in history as one of the seminal creators for the IP. Shooter sold the original script in which Projectra debuted to DC Comics editor Mort Weisinger when Shooter was only 14 years old. Publication history In 1965, when he was just 13 years old, Jim Shooter submitted an unsolicited script to DC Comics editor Mort Weisinger. Weisinger was so impressed, he asked Shooter to send in another script. Shooter created a short origin story for Princess Projectra and several other characters and sent it in. Weisinger purchased all of these, and immediately started giving him writing assignments. Shooter's Projectra story first appeared in Adventure Comics #346 (July 1966) (\\"One of Us Is a Traitor\\"), when Shooter was 14 years old. The character later resigned from the Legion of Superheroes, and left the title, though later Legionnaire writer Paul Levitz had always intended to bring her back to the series in some form. In 1985, in the Who Is Sensor Girl? storyline, a new character \\"Sensor Girl\\" was introduced. This character was fully masked, and when eventually unmasked, turned out to have been Projectra the whole time. Sensor Girl's true identity was unknown to the other characters in the story and even to some of the creators on the title. Penciller Steve Lightle, who created Sensor Girl's costume, had no idea the character was supposed to be Princess Projectra, and believed her to be Supergirl. It is believed Levitz came up with the idea that Sensor Girl was Projectra significantly far into the development process of the story. After this story line, she returned to her \\"Projectra\\" identity, but the character's most enduring association is arguably with this brief interlude as a mystery character. Starting in the July 2019 series Legion of Super Heroes: Millennium, the character received a significant visual re- design. Fictional character biography Projectra (often called by her nickname \\"Jeckie\\", a shortened form of her name) is a member of the royal family of the low-tech planet Orando, and possesses the superhuman ability to generate illusions affecting all five senses. During her membership in the LSH, she met, fell in love with, and married the martial artist Karate Kid. After her father King Voxv died, she fought both her cousin Pharoxx and her grandmother and mentor, Hagga, who sought to usurp the throne. Afterward she became Queen Projectra of Orando, and she and Karate Kid became reserve members of the Legion of Super-Heroes. When the Legion of Super-Villains invaded Orando, Nemesis Kid defeated Karate Kid in personal combat and killed him. Projectra subsequently killed Nemesis Kid in revenge, claiming royal privilege to do so even though it violated the Legion's code against killing. She resigned from the Legion of Super-Heroes during Karate Kid's funeral and used the Legion of Super-Villains' warp devices to take Orando to another dimension to preserve them from 30th century technology and dangers. Princess Projectra as Sensor Girl. Drawn by Greg LaRocque and Mike DeCarlo in Legion of Super-Heroes #37. Projectra was later ordered by her elders to pay penance for indirectly bringing the Legion of Super-Villains to Orando and returned to the Legion's dimension, using the pseudonym Sensor Girl. Her powers were enhanced giving her the ability to see beyond the illusions of life (such as the \\"illusions\\" of distance and physical obstacles). Rather than create obvious illusions, she used her illusion-projection effects to partially or completely block her opponents' senses, project an illusion of darkness (similar to that of Shadow Lass), or disorient victims by making it appear that their skin had vanished. Projectra kept the basis of her sensory alterations secret, since enemies familiar with her illusions might be able to ignore them. Initially she kept her identity hidden even from her fellow Legionnaires except for Saturn Girl, who vouched for her. She also cloaked herself with an illusionary disguise which fully masked her face. Some Legionnaires (particularly Brainiac 5) believed that she was a clone of Supergirl, who had been murdered by the Anti-Monitor during the Crisis. Projectra was later unmasked by the Emerald Empress during a battle with the Fatal Five. Afterwards, however, most individuals outside of the Legion continued to remain unaware of her true identity. Sensor Girl was at one point the Legion leader. Within the five-year timespan following the Magic Wars, Earth fell under the covert control of the Dominators, and withdrew from the United Planets. During this period, Projectra lost her heightened Sensor Girl abilities (although her original illusion-casting powers remained). Some time later, the members of the Dominators' highly classified \\"Batch SW6\\" escaped captivity. Originally, Batch SW6 appeared to be a group of teenage Legionnaire clones, created from samples apparently taken just prior to Ferro Lad's death at the hands of the Sun- Eater. Later, they were revealed to be time-paradox duplicates, every bit as legitimate as their older counterparts. However, the SW6 version of Projectra was killed in battle (along with SW6's Chameleon Boy and Karate Kid) fighting Dominion troops. Post-Zero Hour reboot The 1994 event known as Zero Hour removed Projectra/Sensor Girl from continuity. A new, non-humanoid Sensor character with similar powers was introduced in her place in the reboot continuity.Legionnaires #43 (December 1996) Threeboot In 2004 continuity, Projectra is once again human. She is initially depicted as a spoiled child of the Orando royals and a non-powered but financially well- endowed supporter of the new Legion. Her demeanor changes when her homeworld is destroyed, leaving her without a family or any financial and social privileges. Projectra's attitude has become increasingly cold, detached, and almost selfish in nature. The tragic demise of her parents has also awakened her hereditary powers, the ability to generate illusions, based on a particular form of witchcraft. She has since expressed some degree of interest in human history, especially the actions of the 21st century heroes as detailed in comic books, often asking her friends to translate ancient comics from English to Interlac. She is in a relationship with Timber Wolf. She has come to blame the Legion and the United Planets for the destruction of Orando, becoming increasingly colder and reclusive with the time passing. Upon meeting some Orando survivors, she plans her vengeance on the Legion, at first in a sneaky, covert way, then taking some vicious, proactive steps. These steps included having Nura Nal, at the time trapped in Brainiac 5's mind, blinded and stripped of her powers by the physical representations of Brainiac 5's inhibitions and urgesLegion of Super-Heroes (vol. 5) #47 (December 2008) (she would have been killed, if not for his superior mental discipline); viciously beating up Phantom Girl; and hypnotically mindwiping Saturn Girl to prevent her from speaking the truth about her findings upon her.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 5) #49 (February 2009) Despite Timber Wolf discovering her treachery at the same time as Imra, and without being discovered, he deliberately hid the proof against her, activating Phantom Girl's Legion Ring Alarm only when he was sure Projectra was away, saving Tinya's life but granting his lover impunity. Nearing the end of the current run of the Legion, Princess Projectra's power increased exponentially, granting her absolute mastery on the id of individuals. In addition to creating illusions, her witchcraft can now briefly alter the behavior of individuals, forcing them to act out of their basest emotions, like rage and lust, and even grant a tangible form to inhibitions and the darkest corner of someone's psyche. Her increased powers are now fueled by the desire of revenge and the lingering id of everyone who died on Orando. Since her powers, fueled by magic, are able to prey on the subconscious and the most atavic part of the human brain, she's more powerful than a skilled telepath like Saturn Girl, since a telepath must always start from the higher, conscious brain functions: because of this difference, the Threeboot incarnation of Projectra, despite being unable to hide her anger from Saturn Girl, was able to mindwipe her, placing in Imra's mind convincing false memories so precise as to fool her. Post-Infinite Crisis In the pages of Justice Society of America #6, the pre-Crisis Sensor Girl seemingly returns, and now the seventh pre-Crisis Legionnaire to arrive along with Dream Girl, Star Boy, Dawnstar, Wildfire, Timber Wolf, and Karate Kid. Writer Geoff Johns has indicated that this group is, for all intents and purposes, the original Legion, who have merely been \\"missing\\" from continuity since Crisis on Infinite Earths, possibly due to machinations by the Time Trapper.. One difference in Sensor Girl's history is Superman's full knowledge of her true identity as Projectra before Crisis on Infinite Earths; in original continuity, this revelation was made in the post-Crisis timeline. Sensor Girl, after being sent into the past along with the six other Legionnaires, suffered a type of mental breakdown and hid in Slaughter Swamp until her presence was almost discovered by Damage, Liberty Belle, Wonder Woman, Hourman, and Black Lightning. She then created the illusion of an abandoned hideout of the Secret Society of Super Villains (visually resembling a run-down version of the Hall of Doom), along with illusions of Triplicate Girl and Computo to try to keep them distracted. The Computo illusion attacked the heroes until the Legionnaires and the rest of the Justice League and Justice Society arrived. Dawnstar reawoke Sensor Girl using the \\"wake-up word\\" that was used on the others (Lightning Lad in Interlac). However, Superman remembered the original battle between Computo and the Legionnaires, when Computo killed one of Triplicate Girl's copies, thus turning her into Duo Damsel. He and Power Girl saw through the fa√ßade using their x-ray vision. However, all seven of the Legionnaires had already left by the time they noticed, with Sensor Girl still playing out the mock battle. Rejoining her team, Sensor Girl participated in a mysterious ritual using lightning rods created by Brainiac 5. Sensor Girl returned to the future after the Legionnaires completed their mission in the 21st century. Some time later, when the Legion was discredited by the Earth- Man and his \\"Justice League of Earth,\\" she was counted among the missing Legionnaires who had disappeared during the Legion's dispersal across the galaxy. It is revealed in Superman #692, that Sensor Girl is living in 21st century Metropolis, going by the name of Officer Wilcox and working for the Science Police. As revealed in Adventure Comics (vol. 2) #8, Sensor Girl is part of a secret team sent by the late RJ Brande to the 21st century to save the future in the Last Stand of New Krypton storyline.

The widespread offset-printing process is composed of the four spot colors cyan, magenta, yellow, and key (black) commonly referred to as CMYK. More advanced processes involve the use of six spot colors (hexachromatic process), which add orange and green to the process (termed CMYKOG). The two additional spot colors are added to compensate for the ineffective reproduction of faint tints using CMYK colors only. However, offset technicians around the world use the term spot color to mean any color generated by a non-standard offset ink; such as metallic, fluorescent, or custom hand-mixed inks. When making a multi-color print with a spot color process, every spot color needs its own lithographic film. All the areas of the same spot color are printed using the same film, hence, using the same lithographic plate. The dot gain, hence the screen angle and line frequency, of a spot color vary according to its intended purpose. Spot lamination and UV coatings are sometimes referred to as 'spot colors', as they share the characteristics of requiring a separate lithographic film and print run.  Computer methods  There are various methods to incorporate rather sophisticated patterns of spot colors in the final prepress artwork. Software applications such as Adobe InDesign, Adobe Illustrator, CorelDRAW, QuarkXPress and Scribus may generate spot colors as additional channels. Adobe Photoshop can also be used to generate soft edges (widely known as feathered edges) of spot colors. The dissolve effect provided by Adobe Photoshop layer patterns can be generated for any spot color.  Optimizing usage  Generally the cost and potential for problems for a print job increase as one adds more spot colors, due to the increased cost and complexity of added process inks and films, and requiring more runs per finished print. However, because of the complicated process, spot colors are effective at preventing forgeries of money, passports, bonds and other important documents. Money printing for example, uses secret formulae of spot colors, some of which can be seen by the naked eye and some that can only be seen by using special lights or applying certain chemicals.  Classification  Spot color classification has led to thousands of discrete colors being given unique names or numbers. There are several industry standards in the classification of spot color systems, such as: * Pantone, the dominant spot color printing system in the United States and Europe. * Toyo, a common spot color system in Japan. * DIC Color System Guide, another spot color system common in Japan ‚Äì it is based on Munsell color theory.The Informed Illustrator: Digital Spot Color Systems * ANPA, a palette of 300 colors specified by the American Newspaper Publishers Association for spot color usage in newspapers. * GCMI, a standard for color used in package printing developed by the Glass Packaging Institute (formerly known as the Glass Container Manufacturers Institute, hence the abbreviation). * HKS is a color system which contains 120 spot colors and 3,250 tones for coated and uncoated paper. HKS is an abbreviation of three German color manufacturers: Hostmann-Steinberg Druckfarben, Kast + Ehinger Druckfarben and H. Schmincke & Co. * RAL is a color matching system used in Europe. The so- called RAL CLASSIC system is mainly used for varnish and powder coating. Because each color system creates their own colors from scratch, spot colors from one system may be impossible to find within the library of another.

He lives in the future, comes from the planet Myar, and is an enemy of the Legion of Super-Heroes. Created by Jim Shooter, Nemesis Kid first appeared in Adventure Comics #346 (July 1966). Fictional character biography In his first appearance, Hart Druiter applied to the Legion of Super-Heroes to be a member, along with Princess Projectra, Karate Kid, and Ferro Lad.Adventure Comics #346 (July 1966) He identified himself as a native of the planet Myar, the \\"Alchemy Planet\\", and claimed he had created a mystical potion that gave him his powers. He was actually sent to infiltrate the Legion of Super-Heroes on behalf of the alien Khunds. When his deception was revealed, he tried to frame Karate Kid as the traitor; when that failed, he fled. He later became a founding member of the Legion of Super-Villains under Tarik the Mute.Adventure Comics #372 (September 1968) When a later incarnation of the group invaded the planet Orando under Druiter's leadership, Nemesis Kid engaged Karate Kid in single combat. Before the fight ended Karate Kid sacrificed himself to stop the Legion of Super-Villains' plans, dealing Nemesis Kid a final blow. Karate Kid's widow, Queen Projectra, attacked Nemesis Kid using her power to generate illusions. Though he had adapted an immunity to her illusions, Projectra intimidated him with her noble fury over the death of her consort (thus immobilizing him from counterattacking and/or preventing him from concentrating to gain a new adaptation) then she broke his neck, executing him as her royal privilege as ruler of Orando. At least five years later, Nemesis Kid was resurrected by Mordru, along with every other corpse in the 30th century, as part of the sorcerer's scheme to take over the universe. His reanimated corpse retained his powers, but he was defeated and his body was incinerated, presumably disposing of him for good. In his original Pre Crisis appearances, Nemesis Kid only suffered three defeats in single combat. Duo Damsel defeated him since his power would not work on her two bodies.Adventure Comics #372 (September 1968) Projectra intimidated him from using his power thus freeing her to execute him (\\"Look into my eyes, churl!\\"). As a resurrected corpse, he proved immune to Projectra's illusions but she turned his strength against him and threw him into a fire, incinerating his corpse. Nemesis Kid did not appear in the reboot Legion. In the \\"threeboot\\" continuity, he appeared in Supergirl and the Legion of Superheroes #22 as a member of a group later identified as Mekt Ranzz's Wanderers. Other than a talent for computer hacking, possibly metahuman- enhanced, he displayed no super-human abilities. Powers and abilities Nemesis Kid possessed the superhuman ability to spontaneously develop the powers appropriate to defeat any single opponent for the duration of the battle, though against more than one opponent his powers would either work against only one target, allow him to escape the situation via teleportation, or fail to work at all. In one recorded instance (Karate Kid #1), he displayed the ability to choose adaptations but his choices were less than successful. In all other cases, his power somehow \\"sensed\\" what would be most effective against a given opponent and generated an adaptation automatically. Nemesis Kid never manifested any but the most basic and direct power to counter an opponent. Thus, against Superboy or Supergirl he would gain superior strength and resistance to damage, rather than the ability to emit kryptonite radiation. His power only provided abilities to beat a single opponent's skill set. Because of this, he typically sought out the most powerful opponent whenever possible. Nemesis Kid's powers were never shown to give him immunity to harm caused by an opponent which is why both Superboy and Karate Kid could injure him, and Projectra was ultimately able to kill him. His power simply seemed to assure that he would inevitably win a conflict against a single opponent. It is not known what the upper limits of his powers were, or if they could generate an adaptation powerful enough to match cosmic menaces such as the Anti-Monitor, the Monarch, Imperiex, or Mordru. While Nemesis Kid could adapt to defeat robots, in the first issue Brainiac 5 built a cell that could resist Nemesis Kid's adaptations. He escaped it by \\"adapting\\" the power of time travel, and traveling to a point in time when the cell wasn't built. It was never shown if Nemsis Kid could adapt to defeat non-sentient items, such as automated weaponry firing upon him, or adapt to an opponent in anything other than a physical contest. However, despite his villainous nature, he somehow passed the Legion's customary (and undepicted) test of a candidate's good character, which could indicate other forms of adaptation. On at least one occasion, Nemesis Kid displayed a profound fear response when he and his LSV partners were confronted by the heroic Legion. This allowed Projectra to defeat him with a simple demonic illusion, which reduced him to a fearful wreck. Nemesis Kid was purportedly a skilled alchemist, but he has never displayed any ability and/or interest in creating other mystical potions, so the claim may have been a cover story to disguise his power's true origin. He has a passing knowledge of 30th century technology and a basic understanding of tactics and strategy. In other media Nemesis Kid appeared in the Legion of Super Heroes episode \\"The Karate Kid\\" voiced by Keith Ferguson. Unlike his original comic book incarnation, this version was truly a hero and had the inherent ability to temporarily nullify anyone else's superpowers and was a member of a special unit of the Science Police. The origin and extent of his abilities is not revealed. He joined the Legion and assisted in taking down Grimbor the Chainsman. Grimbor uses a weapon that he claims is inspired by Nemesis Kid's power and it appears to be identical in effect, but whether there is some closer connection between the two is not revealed. Presumably there is an upper limit to his nullification ability as the Legion have not used Nemesis Kid in subsequent anticipated encounters against Imperiex.

Apponequet serves secondary academic education students from the towns of Freetown, Assonet, and Lakeville. It is the only high school within the Freetown-Lakeville Regional School District.  History  In the early 20th century many small towns in Massachusetts sent their older students to other cities' or towns' high schools on a tuition basis to avoid the cost of building and maintaining their own secondary facility. As towns with high schools grew, they became unable to provide tuition spaces, needing the space for their own students. This created the need for more high schools, as tuition contracts slowly began to expire and not be renewed. The communities of Freetown, Berkley, Carver, Lakeville, and Rochester, Massachusetts formed a planning committee for a regional high school, as each town needed a location for its secondary school students. Carver dropped from the board in 1955 after forming a region with Plymouth, and the remaining towns voted. Freetown and Lakeville approved the school, while Berkley and Rochester did not. Berkley would go on to form a tuition agreement with Somerset, and Rochester formed a region with Marion and Mattapoisett (Old Rochester Regional). On April 8, 1957, town meetings were held in Freetown and Lakeville on the issue of the two towns building and operating a high school together. The vote in Freetown was 140-22 in favor, and in Lakeville 160-90, also in favor. Freetown appropriated $20,347 for the preliminary planning of the school, and Lakeville appropriated $18,152 as its share. Land for the school was given by Paul Leonard and Frank Mello on Howland Road in Lakeville. On September 10, 1957, Israel T. Almy, a Fall River architect used for the original Freetown Consolidated Elementary School, was selected as the architect for the school. Charles Sawyer was chosen to be the first principal for the school. Apponequet Regional Jr./Sr. High School opened on September 21, 1959, with an initial enrollment of 610 students in grades 7 through 12, including students from Freetown and Lakeville and tuition students from Berkley and Middleboro. The facility originally housed a vocational school, the Apponequet Regional Vocational High School, in addition to the current academic program. Apponequet's vocational program admitted students in grades 9-12. Phased out in the early 1990s in favor of sending students to Old Colony Regional Vocational Technical High School in Rochester, the vocational program at Apponequet remains in several independent living classes. With the building of the former George R. Austin Middle School in 1972, Apponequet became a senior- only high school, enrolling grades 9-12 in both the academic and vocational schools. Major additions and renovations were completed in 1972 (8 classrooms), 1989 (9 classrooms, a new Library/Media Center, and a TV studio/choir room) and 2000 (two classrooms, an Art Room, a Lecture Hall/choir room, and extensive renovations throughout the building). The 2000 renovation was noted for the destruction of many murals throughout the building that had been designed by students in the late 1980s and early 1990s. As of the 2018-2019 academic year, the administration consists of Principal Dr. Barbara Starkie, and Assistant Principals John Higgins and Kahlan Dessert. Academics Apponequet Regional High School currently has an enrollment of approximately 800 students in grades 9-12. The school's 83% graduation rate is lower than the Massachusetts state average of 86%.http://www.publicschoolreview.com/school_ov/school_id/37726 Apponequet provides currently 16 Advanced Placement classes that are offered to all students. Currently, ARHS offers two foreign languages: Spanish and French. Both AP Classes are offered for each language. Apponequet also participates in the Virtual High School. A program consisting of courses not traditionally offered at ARHS.  Advanced Placement  Apponequet Regional High School offers Advanced Placement courses in English Literature and Composition, English Language and Composition, European History, United States History, Psychology, Calculus, Biology, Physics, Environmental Science, Chemistry, Spanish, French and Studio Art. Students may also access AP courses through VHS. A total of 354 Advanced Placement exams were administered to 200 students in May, 2018. Overall, 55% of all students in grades 11 and 12 took at least one AP exam, and 76% of the exams administered received scores of ‚Äú3‚Äù or above. Students scored above state averages in 10 subject areas.  National Honor Society  The honor roll is composed of students who have met high academic achievement standards. It is created when report cards are issued. There are three categories of academic honors: Highest Honors - no grade lower than an A High Honors - no grade lower than an A- Honors - no grade lower than a B. Selection for Membership: A student who has achieved an academic average of 3.6 at the conclusion of his/her second or third year of study at ARHS is eligible for membership in the National Honor Society. The student will be notified in writing of his/her eligibility and will be invited to complete an application for admission. The application, reviewed by the National Honor Society Advisory Council, will provide the council with documentation of the student's leadership skills, high moral character and participation in at least 10 hours of school and community service.  Virtual High School  Virtual High School is an on-line/distance learning opportunity. Through VHS, students enroll in unique courses not traditionally available at ARHS. Students may earn up to 2.5 credits per semester or up to 5 credits per year and may choose from a catalog of semester and yearlong courses, including Honors, College Preparatory, and Advanced Placement. VHS classes take place entirely over the Internet and mirror the format of college courses. The structure of VHS courses requires productivity, initiative, and self-direction from students who will be entirely accountable and responsible for their own learning. Students enrolled in VHS report to the Library or another assigned space to attend class. However, students can complete their work at any time during the week, as long as work is posted by specified due dates. A site coordinator is available for assistance and distribution of materials and progress reports. Students are chosen on a first come first served basis with preference given to seniors and juniors. Students may not enroll in any VHS course that is currently being taught at ARHS. VHS courses count toward a student‚Äôs GPA and class rank. VHS courses also count toward fulfillment of the graduation requirements.  Graduation Requirements  All students in the Class of 2019 are required to earn 110 credits as well as earn a Competency Determination through participation in MCAS testing in order to graduate. All students in the Class of 2020 are required to earn 115 credits as well as earn a Competency Determination through participation in MCAS testing in order to graduate. All students in the Classes of 2021 and 2022 are required to earn 120 credits as well as earn a Competency Determination through participation in the Next Generation MCAS testing in order to graduate. In order to earn a Competency Determination, all students must score above a 240 on English Language Arts and Math MCAS exams or successfully complete an Educational Proficiency Plan (EPP) if their scores range between 220-238. In addition, all students must pass a Science MCAS with a score of 220 or better. Students in the Class of 2021 will be subject to any scoring requirements associated with the Next Generation MCAS.  Accreditation  Apponequet Regional High School is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges, a non- governmental, nationally recognized organization whose affiliated institutions include elementary schools through collegiate institutions offering post- graduate instruction. Demographics As of the 2018-19 school year, the enrollment at Apponequet is 727. Of those students, enrollment by Race/Ethnicity is as follows: African American 1.1%, Asian 1.1%, Hispanic 2.9%, Native American 0.3%, White 92.4%, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander 0.3%, Multi-Race, Non-Hispanic 1.9%. http://profiles.doe.mass.edu/profiles/student.aspx?orgcode=06650505&orgtypecode;=6&leftNavId;=300&  Sports  Apponequet offers a variety of sports. Sports for the fall season consist of football, field hockey, golf, soccer, volleyball, cross country, and cheerleading. In the winter ice hockey, basketball, indoor track, and swimming are offered. Spring sports consist of baseball, softball, lacrosse, tennis, and outdoor track. Apponequet's mascot is the Lakers. The word 'Apponequet' refers to the native tribe that resided within the local area surrounding the school. Previously, the image used as the Laker mascot consisted of a Red Indian chief and spear. These images were featured on the sports uniforms and clothing relating to the Lakers athletics. However, this was replaced in recent times due to controversy over Native American mascots. Currently the Lakers have adopted the University of Arizona 'A' as their emblem on uniforms and clothing. In the mid-to-late 1960s the school belonged to the South Shore League. It later removed itself to the Mayflower League for the 1970s and early 1980s, and finally joined the South Coast Conference upon its founding in 1986. The 2000 renovation, noted above, also updated the athletic complex, including the football field (Griffith Field), the gymnasium, several Baseball fields, a Softball field, six Tennis courts, and provisions for Soccer, Field Hockey and Ultimate Frisbee venues.  Swimming and Diving  The school boasts a Southern Conference Championship girls swim team and a separate two-time Southern Conference Championship boys swim team (2013 and 2014), both coached by Brett Pacheco. The girls and boys teams combined into a co-ed swim team in 2014 when they joined the South Coast Conference. Both teams went on to claim the South Coast Conference Championship titles in both 2015 and 2016. The boys swim team has remained undefeated in conference dual swim meets for the past four consecutive years (2013-2016). The swim teams practice at the George R. Austin Intermediate School pool.  Football  The school's traditional Thanksgiving Day football rival is Old Rochester Regional High School in Mattapoisett. Home games feature cheerleaders, the marching band, and majorettes. Each group has their own performance during half time. The football team has won the South Coast Conference Championship 5 times - 1997, 2001, 2004, 2008, 2010. In 2008, the football team completed an undefeated regular season (11-0), won its first outright SCC Championship, and earned a spot in the EMass D-IIA Playoffs for the first time. Unfortunately, Apponequet was defeated in the first round by powerhouse Duxbury by a score of 31-13.  Cheerleading  The cheerleading squad is made up of students in grades 9 through 12. In 2007 the Apponequet Cheerleading Squad was featured on the MTV reality show MADE. Extracurricular activities Apponequet offers a variety of extracurricular activities aside from sports. These include Art, Share, Travel Club, Band and Choir, DECA, Diversity Coalition, Drama Club, Engineering Club, Environmental Club, HOSA, GSA, Majorettes, Math Team, SHAPE, and Student Council. Band Apponequet instrumental ensembles consist of a concert band, jazz band, and a marching band. The bands are under the direction of Ed Ledwith. Each year students from Apponequet's band audition for various festivals put on by Massachusetts Music Educators Association and the Southeastern Massachusetts School Bandmasters Association. Apponequet's marching band performs each year at home football games with a halftime performance and in various local holiday parades. The concert band performs a winter and spring concert each year, as well as making other musical appearances. = Jazz Band = Jazz Ensemble is a performing group that rehearses one evening per week. Students learn how to perform music in various jazz styles, and practice their improvisation skills. The Jazz Ensemble performs at ARHS concerts and competition festivals, as well as local events. Choir Apponequet has five choral groups. One is the general concert choir, which is led by Ed Ledwith. There are also three select choral groups. On July 12, 2007 the Apponequet Summersing choir performed both The Star Spangled Banner and O Canada at Fenway Park for a Boston Red Sox game versus the Toronto Blue Jays.  DECA  DECA is an international association of high school marketing students.  Drama  Two productions are completed each school year. In the fall a play is performed and in the spring, a musical.  Environmental Club  The Environmental Club is a volunteer organization of students interested in environmental issues.  Majorettes  High School Band Majorettes participate in football games, band shows, pep rallies, parades, and other band activities. Majorettes are selected to the squad on the basis of their ability in the areas of twirling, marching, poise, and bearing, and grades. Auditions are held at the end of the school year.  Math Team  The Math Team is a competitive organization which is open to all students who demonstrate a proficiency and interest in mathematics. The team competes in the Southeastern Massachusetts Conference Math League which consists of 20 teams. There are four league meets, held once every 5 weeks from October through February, with a playoff meet in March and the State meet in April. Practice sessions are held once a week throughout the year. In addition, members have the opportunity to compete for scholarships via the Annual Worcester Polytech Math Contest, the Olympiad, and the American High School Math Exam. Student Council Apponequet participates in the Massachusetts Association of Student Councils (MASC) as well as The Southeastern Massachusetts Association of Student Councils (SEMASC). The Student Council is in charge of various events, like Homecoming, Apponecon: Apponequet's Game Night, Pep Rally, Spirit Weeks, Turkey Bingo, and Dude Be Nice Week.  Post Graduation  Graduates receive a high school diploma. Many graduates continue their education at any college, university, or technical school. There were 187 students in the 2018 senior class. Approximately 90-95% of these students continued on to higher education. The Class of 2018 sent 62% of its members to four-year colleges and 30% to two-year colleges and trade schools.

The town was originally called Geraldton until 1910. In the , the town of Innisfail had a population of 7,236 people, while the locality of Innisfail had a population of 1,145 people. Innisfail is the major township of the Cassowary Coast Region and is well renowned for its sugar and banana industries, as well as for being one of Australia's wettest towns. In March 2006, Innisfail gained worldwide attention when severe Tropical Cyclone Larry passed over causing extensive damage.  Geography  Innisfail's town centre is situated at the junction of the North and South Johnstone Rivers, approximately from the coast. It is located near large tracts of old-growth tropical rainforest surrounded by vast areas of extensive farmlands. Queensland's highest mountain, Mount Bartle Frere; part of Australia's Great Dividing Range, is to the north. The town's central business district is in the vicinity of Edith Street and Rankin Street (). Climate Howe St. in East Innisfail is commonly affected by even minor flooding Although the rest of Queensland is dominated by savannas, Innisfail experiences a tropical rainforest climate (K√∂ppen: Af) as it has no month with a mean temperature below or with less than of rainfall. However, as a trade- wind climate that experiences frequent cyclones, it is not equatorial. Consistently, humid, very warm to hot weather dominates in Innisfail. In particular Innisfail is reputed as being among the wettest towns in Australia. Babinda, north of Innisfail is generally considered to be the wettest. Unlike most of tropical Australia, the southern winter or \\"dry\\" season is not completely dry as moist easterly winds bring frequent showers;See Mean rainfall May to September for an explanation rainfall is, however, still far lower than during the southern summer. Monthly totals of over are a routine occurrence in the region between January and April and some months will not experience a day without rain if the monsoon is unusually heavy. The town gets around 71.8 clear days per year. Innisfail is consistently under threat from tropical cyclones developing in the Coral Sea in and around summer months. Furthermore, high rainfall associated with aforementioned cyclones and monsoons, combined with Innisfail settlement on adjoining rivers causes flooding to be commonplace, occurring to varied degrees of severity annually.  History  Prior to European settlement the Innisfail area was occupied by five separate societies of the Mamu people. These Aboriginal people followed migratory lifestyles in the rainforest and traversed rivers in string-bark canoes. The first arrival of European people came in January 1872 when survivors of the shipwreck, the \\"Maria\\" arrived on the coastal areas surrounding what is now the Johnstone River. Sub-Inspector Robert Arthur Johnstone of the Native Police came with the intention of rescuing remaining survivors and collectively punishing Aboriginals thought to have killed a number of the shipwrecked crew. In mid 1873, Johnstone returned to the area as part of another punitive mission and ventured further upriver between what is today Flying Fish Point and Coquette Point. Johnstone wrote very highly of the area, stating: alt= In October 1873, Johnstone again returned as part of the Northeast Coast Expedition led by the explorer George Elphinstone Dalrymple. British settlement was first established at the junction of the north and south branches of the Johnstone River by this expedition on 5 October 1873. It was named Nind's Camp after Philip Henry Nind who accompanied the party. Later in 1879, Irishman Thomas Henry Fitzgerald arrived in the area to establish a sugar industry at his Innisfail Estate (now the locality of that name). He was accompanied by large numbers of Kanaka South Sea Islanders workers accompanied by smaller numbers of Irish labourers. The house built by Fitzgerald and thus the first establishment in the area was called Innisfallen, after the largest island in the Lakes of Killarney, Ireland. Inis F√°il (Island of Destiny) is an ancient Irish name for Ireland itself. The name is used in the rarely sung third verse of \\"The Soldier's Song\\", the Irish national anthem. The stone mentioned may be the stone at Tara, Co Meath, at which high kings of Ireland were crowned. From 1879, the settlement was named Geraldton (officially in July 1883) by Fitzgerald, but on 20 August 1910 it was renamed \\"Innisfail\\" to avoid confusion with the town of the same name in Western Australia. Johnstone River Post Office opened on 1 November 1882 (a receiving office had been open from 1880), was renamed Geraldton two months later and Innisfail in 1910. Architectural drawing of the Geraldton Hospital, 1885 In May 1885, the Queensland Government called for tenders to build the Geraldton Hospital to replace the existing tent hospital; however, the tenders submitted were more expensive than the government was willing to pay, so they called again for tenders in September 1885 resulting in a contract with E. Couchman for ¬£1527. Geraldton Provisional School opened on 18 July 1887. On 1 August 1894 it became Geraldton State School. In 1913 the name was changed to Innisfail State School to reflect the renaming of the town. Sacred Heart Catholic School opened on 2 November 1902 with an enrolment of 42 students. It was operated by the Sisters of the Good Samaritan. It was renamed Good Counsel Catholic Primary School in 1975. When the Sisters were no longer able to lead the school, it was briefly led by the Marist Brothers until the first lay principal was appointed in 1982. The Sisters withdrawing from teaching in the school in 1990. In 1906, Patrick Leahy established the Johnstone River Advocate newspaper, with the first issue published in December that year. Later it was renamed the Johnstone River Advocate and Innisfail News, the Evening Advocate, and the Innisfail Chronicle. The newspaper continues to be published as the Innisfail Advocate. In June 1912 there was a meeting that resulted in the creation of the Johnstone River Agricultural Association with the intention to hold their first agricultural show that same year. The first show was held on Friday 11 and Saturday 12 October 1912 in recreation ground (now Callender Park) with exhibits in the Shire Hall and the Oddfellows Hall. In 1935 the show needed more space and the present showgrounds were established (in present-day Goondi Hill) with purpose-built buildings and a show ring. The show was held annually apart from 1942 and 1942 when, due to World War II, the army was using the showground. In 1986 many of the showgound's buildings were badly damaged by Cyclone Winifred with further damage sustained during Cyclone Larry in 2006. In 2002 the show introduced a banana packing competition which was very popular. A huge cyclone swept through Innisfail on 10 March 1918, causing immense damage and killing many people. So many buildings were severely damaged, that many new buildings were erected after the cyclone using concrete rather than the more traditional timber with tin roof. As Art Deco architecture was popular at that time, many of the new buildings were built in the Art Deco style. As a result, Innisfail is now considered one of the best Australian towns for Art Deco and Streamline Moderne architecture. The 1920s and 1930s saw the beginning of a major period of settlement by Italian immigrants and noteworthy populations from Greece and Malta. Later in this period populations from Yugoslavia, India and the Philippines would also settle in the area. Innisfail East State School opened on 3 February 1936. Innisfail State High School opened on 24 January 1955 and operated until the end of 2009 at 2 Stitt Street (Mighell, ). In 2010, it was amalgamated with the Innisfail Inclusive Education Centre (a special education facility) and Tropical North Queensland TAFE (Innisfail Campus) to form Innisfail State College using the site of the TAFE campus at Innisfail Estate. On 3 July 1970, Innisfail State School introduced a special education program called Opportunity Classes. In 1980 these were replaced by the opening of Innisfail Special School on 29 January 1980. On 7 March 2003 the school was renamed Innisfail Inclusive Education Centre. In 2010 it was amalgamated into the Innisfail State College. Radiant Life Christian College opened on 13 February 1982 and closed on 1 November 1991. In 2001 Los Angeles band Sugar Ray filmed part of their music DVD \\"Music in High Places\\" at the Johnstone Crocodile Farm in Innisfail. The Innisfail War Memorial in Jack Fossey Park on Fitzgerald Esplanade was dedicated on 16 April 2005; it commemorates those who served in all wars.alt= Innisfail suffered extensive damage in 2006 due to tropical Cyclone Larry, an Australian Category 5 cyclone with over 100mm of rain in the span of three hours. It struck Innisfail at 7am on 20 March 2006, with the eye of the storm passing over the town. Severe structural damage occurred over the entirety of the township, the main damage being a portion of houses losing roofs and windows and the cyclone rendered even more homes structurally unsound. Power was effectively eliminated from the town and generators became a luxury in many homes. Clean drinking water was also compromised in many homes leading to health fears. The swift response of the Australian Defence Force was praised by many and the cleanup campaign they orchestrated allowed for total utilities restoration within 3 weeks. Severe damage was done to crops and plantations (mainly bananas) which had a serious economic impact on the region. Only one indirect death was record as a result of the cyclone. While Innisfail was always reputed to have a positive sense of community spirit, the aftermath of Tropical Cyclone Larry and the unified cleanup effort acted to promote this spirit through shared suffering. Cyclone Larry was a direct and primary cause of the widely reported and dramatic surge in banana prices in Australia. Inflated cost remained until farmers were able to meet demand again in early 2007. After the cyclone the township underwent something of an economic boom that stemmed from an influx of tradespeople and business eager to capitalise upon relatively significant insurance payouts. According to reports local trade had increased some 30 ‚Äì 40% opposed to expected increases of 10%. On 8 February 2007 the Johnstone Shire Council was sacked by the Queensland Government by the Local Government Minister, Andrew Fraser because of internal conflict, inappropriate behaviour and financial problems. In 2011, in the early morning of 3 February, Cyclone Yasi crossed the far north Queensland coast causing damage to the Innisfail area. Although the damage was not as severe as Cyclone Larry, Cyclone Yasi still had a huge impact on Innisfail bringing strong winds of possibly 285 kilometres per hour.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees, Montreal Expos, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Toronto Blue Jays and Los Angeles Dodgers. Playing career New York Yankees Rivera was signed by the New York Yankees as a non-draft amateur free agent in 1996 and made his Major League debut on September 4, 2001 against the Toronto Blue Jays. He was hitless in four at-bats in three games that first season. He returned to the Yankees on June 5, 2002 and recorded his first hit, a double, against the Baltimore Orioles. He hit a .265 batting average with one home run in 2002, Nevertheless, it was enough to warrant Baseball America naming him the #1 prospect in the Yankees organization. His strengths were described as 'above-average raw power', 'crushes fastballs' and had excellent defense. However, in spite of good contact, an impatient hitter and an average runner who would likely get slower with age. Rivera was again recalled in 2003, this time to hit seven homers (including a multi-homer game) with 26 RBI and a .266 batting average. Montreal Expos He, along with Nick Johnson and Randy Choate were traded to the Montreal Expos before the 2004 season for Javier V√°zquez. In 134 games with Montreal in 2004, he finished with a .307 batting average, 12 homers and 49 RBI. Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim On November 19, 2004, the Expos (on the verge of becoming the Washington Nationals) traded Rivera and shortstop Maicer Izturis to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim for outfielder Jos√© Guill√©n. In his first season as an Angel, Rivera saw playing time as both an outfielder and a designated hitter. Although he started the season slowly, he stepped up his play in the final months of 2005 and finished with a .271 batting average and a then-career high 15 home runs and 59 RBIs in 106 games. During the 2006 campaign, Rivera was made an everyday player, either starting at left field or serving as the designated hitter when veteran Garret Anderson played left. He finished the season with his best statistical year yet, batting .310 with 23 home runs and 85 RBI. Juan Rivera was the starting left fielder for the Venezuelan team in the inaugural World Baseball Classic. While playing for Oriente in Venezuela's winter ball, Rivera broke his leg sliding for first and was placed on the disabled list by the Angels. This injury kept him out for most of the 2007 season, with the exception of a brief appearance for 14 games in September. Los Angeles Angels in 2008 On December 19, 2008, Juan Rivera re-signed with the Angels for three years worth $12.75 million through 2011. Rivera had a good hitting season, especially in the months of May to July. He hit 25 home runs, batted for an average of .287, and had an on-base plus slugging of .810. However, in contrast to the rest of the team, his baserunning was generally poor. Noted baseball analyst Bill James rated him the worst baserunner in the MLB in his annual book, because of his overaggressive tactics including being thrown out 8 times on attempts at going from first to third, costing his team an estimated 40 runs. Rivera got 2010 off to a slow start, batting just .235 over the first two months of the season. He finished the season hitting .243 with 15 home runs. Toronto Blue Jays After the 2010 season, Rivera was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays along with catcher Mike Napoli in exchange for outfielder Vernon Wells. He struggled to start the season after ending Spring training strong, but after being moved to first base to replace an injured Adam Lind, his offense picked up considerably. On July 3, Rivera was designated for assignment by the Blue Jays after hitting .243 with 6 home runs in 70 games for them during the first half of the 2011 season. Los Angeles Dodgers On July 12, 2011, Rivera was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for a player to be named later or cash considerations. On July 15, 2011, in his first at bat as a Dodger, he hit a home run on the first pitch he saw off Joe Saunders of the Arizona Diamondbacks. He went on to play in 62 games for the Dodgers, hitting .274 with 5 home runs and 46 RBI. After the season, he signed a new one-year contract with the Dodgers which included an option for 2013. He spent most of the 2012 season platooning in left field (with Tony Gwynn, Jr. and Bobby Abreu) and at first base (with James Loney). After the Dodgers acquired Shane Victorino and Adri√°n Gonz√°lez in trades, Rivera was relegated to pinch hitting. In 109 games, he hit .244 with 9 home runs and 47 RBI. The Dodgers declined his 2013 option worth $4 million on October 29, instead electing to pay the $400,000 buyout, making him a free agent. New York Yankees On January 28, 2013, the New York Yankees signed Juan Rivera to a minor-league deal.http://espn.go.com/blog/new-york/yankees/post/_/id/48721/yankees-sign- juan-rivera On March 28, he was released by the Yankees.http://espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/story/_/id/9109249/new-york-yankees- release-juan-rivera-favor-lyle-overbay Arizona Diamondbacks On April 30, 2013, Rivera signed a minor league deal with the Diamondbacks, and played 2013 with the Reno Aces. 2015 WBSC Premier12 Venezuela national team in 2015 WBSC Premier12 warm-up game In November 2015, Rivera participated with the Venezuela national team in the inaugural WBSC Premier12. Batting style Rivera is distinguished by his high contact rate and low strikeout rate. In 2009, he had the ninth lowest strikeout percentage in the American League, at 10.8%. His career strikeout rate stands at 11.3% through the 2009 season, compared to an MLB average of 18.0%.

Thomas Andrew Tresser first appeared in The Brave and the Bold #166 (September 1980) and was created by Cary Burkett and Dan Spiegle. Soseh Myrkos first appeared in JSA Annual #1 (October 2000) and was created by David S. Goyer and Uriel Caton. Publication history The Thomas Tresser character was created by writer Cary Burkett in 1979 and named for an actor with whom Burkett was rooming in New Hampshire. The character debuted in an eight-page backup story in The Brave and the Bold #166 (September 1980) written by Burkett and drawn by Dan Spiegle. The character was featured in one of the Final Crisis Aftermath limited series Escape written by Ivan Brandon with art by Marco Rudy. In 2010 he was the eponymous character in the mini-series Nemesis: The Impostors. Fictional character biography Thomas Andrew Tresser Thomas Andrew Tresser is a vigilante, turned operative for the U.S. government and a master of disguise. His default costume is a black turtleneck sweater with a balance as a chest symbol and a chest holster. He was an applicant to an unnamed government agency whose brother Craig was an undercover agent infiltrating a criminal syndicate called \\"the Council\\". Craig was brainwashed into killing their family friend Ben Marshall and was subsequently killed in self-defense by fellow agents. Tom thus became \\"Nemesis\\", preferring to use an alias instead of his dishonored family name. With the assistance of the Batman, he cleared his brother's name and saw the men responsible for his brother's death dead. This was covered in a backup series in The Brave and the Bold #166 through 192, with team-ups with the Batman in #170 and #193. Nemesis was apparently killed in the helicopter crash that killed the Council's leader, though he was later revealed to have survived, thanks to Amanda Waller and Rick Flag. He then became one of the few non-criminal members of the Suicide Squad as a means of paying off what he perceived as a debt. Nemesis became an occasional member of the Suicide Squad, assisting them from time to time, and fell in love with one of their members, Nightshade. During a mission in Moscow with the Suicide Squad, the team tried to rescue Zoya Trigorin. The mission was a failure, as she died in his arms, and he was taken into custody. Rick Flag and Nightshade set up a rescue mission for their teammate, and came into conflict with the Justice League because of it. Eventually, the two teams worked out their differences, and Nemesis was allowed to escape by the Justice League. He continued to work alongside the Squad, but left the team after conflicts with Amanda Waller. He later returned only shortly to help retrieve Flag's kidnapped son and to assist in trying to uncover a secret government cabal. This plot-point was never resolved. Tresser was drafted into the Shadow Fighters to battle the villain Eclipso. He was originally the sole survivor of the Eclipso massacre that claimed the lives of the rest of the Shadow Fighters. He continued the fight against Eclipso in a smaller recon-team that also included Nightshade and the matter-manipulator Chunk. Nemesis and Chunk were saved from a nuclear bomb attack by Nightshade's powers. Nemesis threatens Amanda Waller. After his involvement with the Suicide Squad and the Shadow Fighters ended, he apparently met his end - again - in the pages of Catwoman. In Superman Secret Files 2004, Nemesis was revealed to be alive and well, impersonating Sarge Steel and apparently working for a shadowy Cabal. Furthermore, in the last issue of the second volume of Suicide Squad the then- current team's erstwhile leader Sgt. Rock is revealed to have been an impostor. Given the events of the Superman Secret Files, \\"Rock\\" may well have been Nemesis for some or all of his appearances with the Squad. The story of what happened to Nemesis between his 'death' in Catwoman and subsequent reappearance in Superman Secret Files has not yet been told. One Year Later after the events of Infinite Crisis, Nemesis is seen aiding government agent Diana Prince, Wonder Woman in disguise, in the rescue of Donna Troy from several of the Amazon's villains. Nemesis is part of the newly re-opened Department of Metahuman Affairs under Sarge Steel. Around this time, Nemesis assists in saving the life of the second Maxi-Man. Shortly before the events of the Amazons Attack limited series, Nemesis questions the detainment of Wonder Woman by the D.M.A. and goes against orders to rescue her. He uncovers a plot by the villain Circe to trick the U.S. government into destroying Themyscira under false pretenses. During the Amazon counterattack, he is stung by several gigantic Stygian Killer Hornets, native to the Amazon Nation. Wonder Woman risks her life by traveling to Themyscira for an antidote and revives Nemesis back into health. Shortly thereafter, Nemesis is again wounded in battle. While he is recovering in the hospital, Wonder Woman begins courting Tresser, in the traditional Amazon manner. After formally meeting her mother Queen Hippolyta, he is inducted as a member of the Amazon race despite being a male. He is given the title of Sir Thomas of Cleveland and given the ranking of Guardsman. Tom ends any potential relationship aside of friendship with Diana once he discovers that she does not truly love him but instead wanted to use him to create a family. In the Final Crisis Aftermath: Escape storyline, Tresser is kidnapped and \\"reprogrammed\\" by the Global Peace Agency. He then appears in Nemesis: The Imposters, battling false versions of the DC Universe. During the \\"Heroes in Crisis\\" storyline, Nemesis checked into Sanctuary to deal with the stress of his vigilante work. It is unknown if Nemesis was killed in the unexpected attack or not. Soseh Mykros Nemesis from JSA Annual #1 A second Nemesis debuted in JSA Annual #1 (October 2000), which had no connection with the original and was a completely different character. Soseh Mykros was the genetically engineered daughter of the leader of the Council (not to be confused with the above-mentioned Council), a terrorist group that had once used the hero Paul Kirk, Manhunter. She originally operated as an ally of the Justice Society and assisted the team during a few adventures but soon departed for other causes to her interest. Eventually, she found herself teaming up with Black Adam's group of loose cannon heroes. A group that, while altruistic, had no compunctions about killing or blurring the lines of legitimacy with their respective goals. She soon became romantically involved with her teammate Alexander Montez, a man who had managed to bind the demon Eclipso to himself, and for a time they were happy with one another. Of course, as with many such tragic romances, this was not meant to last for long.

It is a neighbour to North Rock. Sovereignty of the island is disputed. The Canadian Coast Guard continues to staff a lighthouse on the island; the first lighthouse was constructed there in 1832.  Geography  The relationship of Machias Seal Island to the Grand Manan archipelago is a source of some dispute among geologists. The island is considered to be a possible continuation of the series of exposed shoals, rocks, and islets strewn south and west of Grand Manan Island. The deeper Grand Manan Channel lies to the north and west of the island, separating it from the coast of Washington County, Maine. Machias Seal Island is a barren island and devoid of trees. Because of its location at the boundary between the Gulf of Maine and the Bay of Fundy, Machias Seal Island is fog-bound for many days of the year. It is also a sanctuary for seabirds such as Atlantic puffins, razorbills, common murres, common and Arctic terns, Leach's storm-petrels, and common eiders.  History  Likely used by the Passamaquoddy Nation in the pre-European era, Machias Seal Island was never actively nor successfully settled during the years when the French and the British were exploring this part of North America. The island was largely ignored by both Great Britain and the United States during the American Revolutionary War. The Treaty of Paris ended the conflict surrounding the American Revolutionary War. Article 2 attempted to establish the boundaries between the United States and British North America and part of this text stated the following: The \\"northwest angle\\" of Nova Scotia refers to what is today New Brunswick, and the Canada‚ÄìUS border still follows today the St. Croix River and a line due north from its source. Once the St. Croix River was unambiguously identified following a commission provided by Jay's Treaty of 1794, it became clear that Machias Seal Island, as well as Grand Manan Island, was within 20 leagues () of the shores of the United States and south of the line drawn due east from the mouth of the St. Croix River, but it remained unclear whether they were within the defined limits of Nova Scotia. These limits are written in the original text of the land grant dated 1621 to Sir William Alexander (founder of Nova Scotia) in which all \\"... islands, or seas lying near to, or within six leagues of any part ... of the said coasts\\" are deemed part of Nova Scotia. Machias Seal Island lies within 3.5 leagues from Grand Manan Island and 3 leagues from the coast of Maine, although Britain would later cease its claims on other islands in eastern Maine, such as Moose Island. These ambiguities resulted in both countries claiming several islands in Passamaquoddy Bay, Grand Manan Island, and nearby islands. During the War of 1812, the United Kingdom occupied coastal Maine extending from the border with New Brunswick (created from Nova Scotia in 1784) west to the Penobscot River valley. During this time, tolls were charged upon residents at various occupied harbours in the area. The UK withdrew their forces upon signing the Treaty of Ghent in 1814, with the stipulation being that the boundary should be better delineated in the area of the Grand Manan Channel. In 1817, the decision of a joint commission declared that Moose, Dudley, and Frederick Islands belong to the United States, while Grand Manan and all other islands of the Passamaquoddy Bay belong to Canada. Machias Seal Island, not an island of the Passamaquoddy Bay but near Grand Manan, was never directly mentioned. Britain maintained possession of Machias Seal Island, under pressure from shipping interests at the burgeoning port of Saint John. New Brunswick set up a lighthouse in 1832. There is no indication of either nation having a presence on the island prior to 1832. Later boundary treaties and negotiations extended the seaward boundary in the Grand Manan Channel in 1908‚Äì1910 to its present terminus, roughly equidistant between Grand Manan Island and the coast of Maine, and several dozen kilometres (miles) northeast of Machias Seal Island.  Canadian interest  The United Kingdom, and later Canada, have maintained an ongoing interest in the island, largely through the continuous occupation of the lighthouse. Until the 1970s‚Äì1980s, lighthouse keepers from the Canadian Coast Guard would live on the island with their families, receiving supplies by sea from Grand Manan or Saint John. Since 1944, the island has been protected under its designation as the Machias Seal Island Migratory Bird Sanctuary (a wildlife and seabird sanctuary), managed by the Canadian Wildlife Service. No private citizen in Canada has made an ownership claim to Machias Seal Island, and Canada considers the property to be wholly owned by the federal government. The island has long been included in federal and provincial electoral districts, and policing has been enforced on the island by Royal Canadian Mounted Police and on waters surrounding the island by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. In the 20th century, some Canadian residents placed mining claims on the island as an exercise of sovereignty, despite the fact that it is considered a protected area.  United States interest  In 1918, with Canadian agreement, a small detachment of U.S. Marines was placed on the island following the U.S. entry into the First World War, as a means to assist in protecting the territory and its key lighthouse guarding the entrance to the Bay of Fundy from German U-boat attack. These forces were withdrawn after several months, and no U.S. presence has been re- established since. In the past, private citizens in Maine have staked their own claims of the island, and currently an American tour boat operator from Cutler brings tourists to view seabirds during the summer nesting season, although the number of visitors is limited during sensitive periods for the birds.  Gulf of Maine boundary  Sovereignty of Machias Seal Island (and North Rock) would likely not still be in question today if it were not for the decision by Canada and the United States to avoid settling this issue in their 1979 joint application to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) at The Hague in the Netherlands to have the maritime boundary delineated in the Gulf of Maine for fishing and mineral exploration purposes on Georges Bank. Both nations avoided having ICJ rule on the sovereignty of Machias Seal Island and North Rock by agreeing to have a common starting point for the offshore boundary southwest of the island at . The October 12, 1984, ICJ ruling, Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary in the Gulf of Maine Area (Canada/United States of America), has since highlighted a gap in the maritime boundary for several dozen kilometres between the current end of the Canada‚ÄìUS border and the 1984 Gulf of Maine boundary starting point. Machias Seal Island and North Rock lie in the middle of this \\"grey zone\\"‚Äîa term coined by fishermen from both countries, referring to unclear jurisdictional boundaries in the area.  Current status  Seabirds on the rocky island Since the 1984 ICJ ruling on the Gulf of Maine decided the fate of offshore boundaries, Machias Seal Island and neighboring North Rock, an exposed rock outcropping about north-northeast at , as well as the surrounding waters, have become a political football for local politicians in fishing communities of coastal Charlotte County, New Brunswick and Washington County, Maine. There are little to no mineral or petroleum resources in the \\"grey zone\\"; however, there is a valuable lobster fishery; fishermen from both countries are exploiting the lack of rules in the \\"grey zone\\" by overfishing various species. In 1995, the Canadian Coast Guard dramatically reduced the number of manned lighthouses on the Atlantic coast as a cost-saving measure. Today, all lighthouses in Eastern Canada except for the station on Machias Seal Island are unmanned. The Machias Seal Island light had been automated several years prior to the announcement, but Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs is now covering the Canadian Coast Guard's costs to maintain lightkeepers on Machias Seal Island \\"for sovereignty purposes\\". Using the residence on the island, two lightkeepers are flown by helicopter from the coast guard base in Saint John every four weeks to replace the two existing keepers. These Coast Guard employees also assist the Canadian Wildlife Service in maintaining the Migratory Bird Sanctuary, as well as helping any wildlife researchers who may stay on the island for a period of time. In June 2018, US Border Patrol vessels stopped at least ten Canadian fishing boats from New Brunswick, reportedly asking about illegal immigrants. Global Affairs Canada reportedly stated that it is investigating \\"these incidents that occurred in Canadian waters\\". The Grand Manan Fishermen's Association suggested \\"the actions of the US agents may have been routine\\".

On 3 April 1873 Parliament passed an Act to incorporate Prince Alfred Hospital. Mansfield Brothers were appointed as architects to design the buildings. The first building erected was a cottage, near the southern entrance from Missenden Road, which later became the gardener's cottage. Construction started on the Administration Building and C and D Pavilions in 1876, at which time gardens were also established, with assistance from the staff of the Botanical Gardens. The Administration Building is Victorian Free Classical in style, built symmetrically about a three-storied portico. It boasts a cream brick fa√ßade and sandstone embellishments, with red bricks emphasising the ground floor arched openings. The entrance portico has grey granite columns.

Political argument should be distinguished from propaganda, in that propaganda has little or no structure or the rationale, if it exists, is egregiously fallacious. A classic example of political arguments are those contained in The Federalist Papers arguing in favor of ratification of the American constitution. There are several ways of classifying political argument: * Based on the purpose of the argument. * Based on the logical structure of the argument. * Based on the subject matter dealt with in the argument.  Purpose of political argument  The purpose of argument is usually to sway belief. Political argument can occur in the context of political theory; for instance Machiavelli's The Prince can be regarded as advice to rulers based on various kinds of arguments. Political argument though is not generally a purely intellectual activity, since it may also serve the strategic goal of promoting a political agenda. One usually thinks of political argument as exclusive to democracies, but in fact some kinds of political argument may occur in undemocratic regimes as well, for example, to encourage greater sacrifice from the population, although it is more likely in such cases that propaganda will take the place of argument. In a democracy, though, political argument is particularly important, since there is a direct relation between the beliefs of citizens and the structure of power. Moreover, the institutions of a democracy in part define the relationships between beliefs and power. In this case, political argument is an important element of political strategy. It is also possible that in a democracy, propaganda may also replace argument; indeed, much political advertisement has no discernible logical structure, and in our definition falls under propaganda. This view of political argument in a democracy is closely related to the problem of social choice. Consider a social decision model of the kind used in the theory of social choice (such as used in stating Arrow's theorem). In this model society has a set of individuals X and it faces a set (political) alternatives A which need to be ranked in some way. A ranking is a relation R between the elements of A which is transitive and reflexive. Note that two alternatives a, b can satisfy a R b and b R a. If this is the case, we say R is indifferent to a, b. Each individual x in X will have an idiosyncratic ranking Rx of the alternatives in A. A profile is any function P that associate to each individual x a ranking of alternatives Px; a profile is thus a function from X to rankings of A. An arbitration scheme (or constitution or voting scheme) is a way of producing a ranking Rsoc for the whole society from any profile P. Thus an arbitration scheme is itself a function P ‚Üí Rsoc. Though any argument about politics is in a sense a political argument, an effective political argument is one that can actually change the social preference ranking. Effective political argument is a concept distinct from valid political argument.  Example  Consider an idealized system of tax policy; tax is based on a tax cutoff point T, that is individuals with income in excess of T pay taxes, everyone else pays no taxes. In a simple majority rule social arbitration scheme, one might expect that a natural tax rate T can be determined: the median income (plus 1). However, a (possibly fallacious) political argument might attempt to change individual's voting by their pocket book by arguing that investment in capital and general welfare will increase by reducing taxes on higher income levels, that is raising the tax cutoff point. A political argument may be ineffective but may still have a purpose, for instance as a justification for an unpopular political action, or as part of a historical narrative.  Structure of political argument  Any argument claims to prove something. In the case of arguments used in politics, this something is an assertion about an element of the public sphere, such as economic policy, the environment, decisions about war and peace, abortion etc. An argument cannot start from purely logical principles. An argument is based on premises and some methods for reasoning from premises to conclusions. The validity of an argument in politics can be evaluated in at least two ways: in purely semantic terms or in terms of adherence to certain rules of argument (which we can consider rules of fairness). Semantically, one should note that some of the premises used in an argument and the relationships between the assertions in the argument, are associated to specific models of economic or political processes. Other premises are moral assumptions: whether a particular action is good or desirable. For example, arguments concerning war against and must consider questions about specific threats that the adversary poses, the likelihood of success, the cost of war and so on. In practice, purely semantical evaluations of argument validity are extremely difficult to formulate in a politically neutral way, since political positions usually involve commitment to some model of social and economic processes.

Accents contribute to the articulation and prosody of a performance of a musical phrase. Accents may be written into a score or part by a composer or added by the performer as part of his or her interpretation of a musical piece. Compared to surrounding notes: * A dynamic accent or stress accent is an emphasis using louder sound or a stronger sound, typically most pronounced on the attack of the sound. * A tonic accent is an emphasis on notes by virtue of being higher in pitch as opposed to higher in volume.\\"Tonic accent\\", Vocabulary.com. Accessed: 24 April 2020. * An agogic accent is an emphasis by virtue of being longer in duration. Accents which do not correspond to the stressed beats of the prevailing meter are said to be syncopated. For example, in common time, also called 4/4, the most common metre in popular music, the stressed beats are one and three. If accented chords or notes are played on beats two or four, this creates syncopation, as the music is emphasizing the \\"weak\\" beats of the bar. Syncopation is used in Classical music, popular music and traditional music. However, it is more prominent in blues, jazz, funk, disco and Latin music. Agogic There are four kinds of agogic accents : * Longer notated duration of a note, for example, a whole note/semibreve (four beats in common time) among quarter notes/crotchets (each of which gets one beat). * Extended duration of a note within its full-time value (without altering the tempo). For example, players of organ and harpsichord (which do not allow the use of dynamic accents) can emphasize one of a sequence of staccato quarter notes by making it less staccato (that is, making one note longer to emphasize it). * Extended duration of a note with the effect of temporarily slowing down the tempo (rubato or rallentando). * Delayed onset of a note, for example by doing a pause before starting a note. Marks In music notation, an accent mark indicates a louder dynamic and a stronger attack to apply to a single note or an articulation mark. : { \\\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\\\relative c { \\\\time 5/4 b-> b-^ b-. b-! b-- } } From right to left, the meanings of these articulation marks are explained below: * The most common symbol is the horizontal wedge, the first symbol in the diagram above. This is the symbol that most musicians mean when they say accent mark. It indicates that the marked note should have an emphasized beginning and then taper off rather quickly. Though it is usually simply referred to as an accent. In jazz articulation, it is stated as \\"dah\\". * The vertical wedge, shown second, signifies that a note should be played marcato (Italian for \\"marked\\"). It is generally accepted to be as loud as an accent mark and as short as a staccato. Martellato, Italian for \\"hammered\\", is another name for the marcato symbol used primarily by orchestral string musicians as it refers to the specific bowing technique used to create marcato. In jazz articulation, marcato is typically stated as \\"daht\\" yet the performing musician may interpret the duration of the note differently depending on what style of jazz they are playing. * The dot, shown third, signifies that a note should be played staccato. It indicates that the last part of a note should be silenced to create separation between it and the following note. For example, a written quarter note should be played as an eighth note followed by an eighth rest. The duration of a staccato note may be about half as long as the note value would indicate, although the tempo and performers' taste varies this quite a bit. In jazz articulation, it is stated as \\"dit\\". * The staccatissimo mark, shown fourth, is usually interpreted as shorter than the staccato, but composers up to the time of Mozart used these symbols interchangeably. A staccatissimo crotchet (quarter note) would be correctly played in traditional art music as a lightly articulated semi-quaver (sixteenth note) followed by rests which fill the remainder of the beat. * Finally, the tenuto mark, shown fifth above, generally means that a note or chord is to be played at full length. In jazz articulation, it is stated as \\"doo\\". Even when these symbols are absent, experienced musicians will introduce the appropriate gesture according to the style of the music.Accents and Markings - Making Sense of '^' and '.'\\", How to Read Sheet Music. Accessed: 24 April 2020. Mark McGrain writes about articulation on page 156 in his book Music Notation: Theory and Technique for Music Notation.

Early years Jos√© Juli√°n Acosta Calbo was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Francisco de Acosta y Sandoval and Juana Antonia Calbo y Garriga. There he received his primary education. He was one of Rafael Cordero's most notable students. Cordero was an inspiration to Acosta and the influence of his teachings remained with Acosta for the rest of his life. Later, he became a prot√©g√© of Father Rufo Manuel Fern√°ndez, who would send him to Madrid, Spain to study Physics and Mathematics. After he graduated in 1851, Acosta continued to expand his educational knowledge in Paris, London, and Berlin. In Berlin, he was a student of the naturalist Alexander von Humboldt.Enciclopedia Puerto Rico Biografia de Jose Julian Acosta When Acosta returned to Puerto Rico, he took a job as a professor of Botany and Maritime Sciences and became the director of the Civil Institute of Secondary Education. Acosta was the founder and editor of the newspaper El Progreso (Progress), and he collaborated with many other newspapers which were oriented toward liberalism. Abolitionist Between 1865 and 1867, Acosta was a member of a Puerto Rican commission, which included Segundo Ruiz Belvis and Francisco Mariano Qui√±ones, and which participated in the Junta Informativa de Reformas de Ultramar (Overseas Reforms Informative Board) which met in Madrid. Here, Acosta presented the argument for the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico. That same year, whilst in Madrid, Acosta was made a member of the Spanish Royal Academy of History, for his work in the editing of Fray I√±igo Abbad y Lasierra's Historia geografica, civil y natural de la isla de San Juan Bautista de Puerto Rico. (Geographic, Civil, and Natural History of the Island of St. John the Baptist of Puerto Rico) Upon returning to the Island, Acosta, like many other Puerto Ricans with liberal views, was harshly mistreated by the Spanish governor. After the Grito de Lares (Cry of Lares) revolt in 1868, he was suspected of being a conspirator and was imprisoned in the dungeons of Fort San Felipe del Morro by General Pavia, even though he had not participated in the failed revolt. Acosta later published a pamphlet entitled (\\"Hours of Imprisonment\\") describing his experiences in prison. Political career Acosta became a member of the Liberal Reformist Party and in 1870, he founded the political newspaper El Progreso. In 1871 he became an elected representative to the Spanish Courts. In 1873, he became president of the Liberal Reformist Party, but decided to leave the party in 1874, and joined the Autonomist Party formed by Rom√°n Baldorioty de Castro. Legacy On March 22, 1873, Acosta witnessed the success of his abolitionist efforts, with the proclamation of the decree for the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico. Acosta died on August 26, 1891, in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He was interred in Santa Maria Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery in Old San Juan. His great-grandson was Colonel Gilberto Jos√© Marxuach, the \\"Father of the San Juan Civil Defense\\".

In 1979 it relocated to Fitzroy, and adopted its present name. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, it became synonymous with the post punk and new wave subcultures. In late 2004, supporters raised enough money for the station to purchase and move into new premises on the corner of Blyth and Nicholson Streets in Brunswick East after the 20-year lease on their previous studios, in Victoria St, Fitzroy, expired. 3RRR's mission statement was defined in 1990 as \\"To educate, inform and entertain by drawing upon appropriate community resources. To develop a critical approach to contemporary culture.\\" Triple R's programming is split roughly 70% specialist music and 30% talk-based shows. Hosts have creative control over content and the station does not have playlists. As such, the nature of 3RRR broadcasts varies wildly depending on the time of the week. As 3RRR states, \\"With the exception of [the] Breakfasters, all of Triple R‚Äôs programs are presented by volunteers\\" who present their shows for no remuneration. A select few volunteer presenters are also in paid work at the station in operational roles. 3RRR's operations are funded entirely by community sponsorships and public subscribers (currently around 15,000), which, by removing standard commercial pressures, allows for this diverse programming. The estimated current listenership is 440,000 per week. Due to the reaction from subscribers, in the late 1990s 3RRR cancelled sponsorship deals signed with the Ford Motor Company and music venue The Mercury Lounge (due to its location in Melbourne's Crown Casino). No such \\"corporate\\" sponsorship of this type has been considered since. In 2016, 3RRR celebrated its 40th anniversary with a comprehensive exhibition at the State Library of Victoria called, On Air: 40 Years of 3RRR. The exhibition \\"explores the history, culture and character of this iconic station, whose programs continues to influence and inspire Melbourne‚Äôs independent music scene, and provide a vital voice for local community.\\" In 2016, 3RRR was inducted into the Music Victoria Hall of Fame.

It is served by Sydney Trains T2 Inner West & Leppington, T3 Bankstown & T8 Airport & South line services. It is named after the nearby St James' Church and provides a direct link to the Sydney Airport international and domestic railway stations. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. History Elizabeth Street in 1954 Platform Centre of the large island platform. The columns in the middle of the photograph originally stood in the middle of the space between the two inner platforms where the tracks for those platforms would have been laid (they never were). The edge of one of the original island platforms is visible towards the right of the photograph. The walls at the far end are of recent construction: doors give access to the disused sections of the central platforms and rail tunnels. Concourse Part of the Bradfield Plan, St James station was originally intended to be a major interchange with the Eastern Suburbs line on Sydney's underground rail system. Plans for the construction of St James included railway lines in four directions, but the original plan was never completed due to disagreements over the routes. Four platforms were completed, but the two inner platforms, intended to support Bradfield's proposed eastern and western suburbs lines, were never put into service.St James Station NSWRail.net When the Eastern Suburbs line was eventually built it was done so via a different route via Town Hall. In the 1990s, the two island platforms were connected by filling in the space between the two inner platforms, resulting in the single, large island platform seen today. The station was designed by NSW Government Architect, George McRae, but not completed until after his death. It is an example of Inter-War Stripped Classical architecture influenced by Art Deco. One distinctive feature of the station is a neon sign from the late 1930s advertising Chateau Tanunda Brandy installed by Tucker, Lingard & Co. It is located at the northern entrance on Elizabeth Street. It is a companion to Museum station, both opened at the same time and use a roundel design on their station signage that is similar to the one used on the London Underground. St James station opened on 20 December 1926 with the opening of the eastern city line from Central.Sydney Morning Herald 21 December 1926 p11 and p12\\"60 Years Ago\\" Railway Digest December 1986 page 398 For the first 30 years, St James station was used as a terminating station for the Bankstown, East Hills and Illawarra lines. As a terminating station, St James was equipped with a small signal box and two dead end sidings, located in the tunnel stub at the north end of the station.St James Tunnels Neety The St James signal box, equipped with pistol grips, was the smallest such box in New South Wales. Trains arriving at St James would disembark passengers on one of the outer platforms, then the train would move to a siding and reverse direction, coming out at the opposite outer platform. During non-peak hours the driver would simply move to the other end of the train while the train was on the siding. During peak hours the train would take on a second driver in the last car while at the platform, then proceed to one of the sidings, where the drivers would exchange control of the train. Completion of the City Circle loop did not occur until 30 years after St James station opened. Construction of the western city line as far as Wynyard was completed in 1932, but completion of the line connecting Wynyard and St James via Circular Quay, begun in 1936, proved problematic. Construction was halted during World War II and was intermittent after it resumed in 1945 due to inconsistent funding. The above-ground viaduct and Circular Quay railway station were finally completed in 1956, allowing trains to make a single circuit through the city and return to the suburbs without having to terminate. As a result of this, St James's terminating facilities were no longer regularly used. The signal box remained in use until 1990 with the occasional train continuing to terminate at St James to keep the siding tracks usable for emergencies and railway staff familiar with the procedures. In 1985‚Äì86, the signal box was taken out of service for an asbestos abatement project. During this period, train cars allocated for the removal of the asbestos would occupy one or the other of the dead end sidings, which meant that regular use of those lines by passenger trains was not possible. After the asbestos abatement project was completed, the signal box was returned to service until 1990, when asbestos was discovered in the signal box and the sidings. From that time the signal box was not used, and the signals and siding tracks were eventually removed. The sidings were formally closed on 27 July 1991.\\"Signalling & Safeworking\\" Railway Digest November 1991 page 416 In February 2010, a passenger lift between the platform and the concourse opened, followed later by a lift between the concourse and street level.\\"Transit Newsfile: Sydney Trains\\" Transit Australia volume 65 number 11 November 2010 Tunnels St James station is notable for the abandoned tunnels connected to the station. The Australian Railway Historical Society, with the approval of the State Rail Authority, has given tours of the tunnels, but many people have visited the tunnels by entering along the subway tracks. The tunnels were constructed as stubs for the planned eastern and western suburbs lines when the station was built in the 1920s. This was to ensure that the operation of St James would not be disrupted if future work was carried out on the lines. The abandoned tunnels extend some distance in either direction from St James. To the north is a double-track tunnel which proceeds for some 250 metres under Macquarie Street to be roughly parallel with the State Library; to the south two single- track tunnels extend to Whitlam Square at the intersection of Liverpool and College Streets.The St James Railway Tunnels Australian Railway Historical Society Use as a mushroom farm From 1933 to 1934, the tunnel between St James and Circular Quay was used by Raymond Mas as the location for an experimental mushroom farm producing of mushrooms per month. Use during World War II The southern tunnels were modified during World War II to serve as a public air raid shelter. The abandoned air raid shelter begins in the single track section of the southern end of the station and continues into the two single track tunnels beyond. At the station end the air raid shelter is protected by a blast curtain and the doorways and openings for ventilation between the chambers, each about 30 metres long, are protected by blast curtains. The tunnels were also used during World War II as an operations bunker by the No. 1 Fighter Sector RAAF.No. 1 Fighter Sector Headquarters RAAF, later known as No. 101 Fighter Control Unit RAAF Oz at War The bunker was located in what was intended to be the City Inner Tunnel, access to which was provided by a wooden staircase in a shaft leading upward to Shakespeare Place. Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF) personnel housed in this operations bunker collected information from radar and weather stations, as well as reports on air traffic, ship and troop movements collected from airports, army and Volunteer Air Observer Corps reporting posts. This section of tunnel was constructed using a cut and cover technique outside St James station, and connects to the tunnels in St James through pilot tunnels, accessible via ladder. As air quality in the tunnel was poor, WAAAF shifts were limited to six hours. Eventually the health of the WAAAF personnel declined due to poor air quality or poor food, so operations were relocated first to The Capital Theatre in Bankstown, and subsequently to the Bankstown Bunker on Black Charlies Hill near Condell Park. The staircase used to access the bunker was destroyed by fire on 16 November 1968. Smoke from this fire interrupted train service for approximately twelve hours. Underground lake The end of the northern tunnel flooded and produced an underground lake, wide, deep, and long.Underground lake gives hope Daily Telegraph 5 February 2007 Known as St James Lake, it has been used for many years as a swimming hole. In recent years, due to drought and diminishing water supplies in underground aquifers, there have been a number of proposals for how to use the abandoned tunnels and other underground spaces for storage and recycling of water. In the mid-2000s, Ian Kiernan proposed that an abandoned water tunnel, Busby's Bore, be redirected to St James Lake where water could be stored and recycled. Busby's Bore was originally used to carry water from nearby swamps to the Hyde Park area, but was abandoned for that purpose in the 1890s after becoming contaminated by sewage. In 2004 the idea of recycling the water from the bore received support from the executive director of the Botanical Gardens Trust, Tim Entwisle.New interest in dld Sydney bore Waste Management & Environment 7 October 2004 During 2006, it was proposed that the northern unused tunnels be used as a reservoir for irrigation water for The Domain and the Royal Botanic Gardens as part of a Clean Up Australia project to create a series of water reclamation and storage facilities.Solution to water crisis is history Sydney Morning Herald 1 June 2006 Clean Up Australia partnered with a number of groups in the attempt to move the project forward, and in 2007 obtained funding to proceed.Busby's bore Clean Up Australia Also in 2007, State Premier Morris Iemma announced plans to harvest rainwater at Parliament House. According to this plan all storm water from Parliament House, the State Library and Sydney Hospital (all on Macquarie Street) would be drained into the tunnels, treated, and then pumped back to storage tanks at the surface for use in non-potable water systems, saving an estimated each year. In January 2008, the Minister for Transport John Watkins said he intended to ask RailCorp to begin a study to determine if the underground network of tunnels could be used for water storage.Secret city reservoir for drought Daily Telegraph 16 January 2008 The project began on 15 January 2008 when water tanks for storage of the recycled water were installed on the top of Parliament House.Sydney harnesses CBD's underground lake ABC News 15 January 2008 Water scheme scratches surface Sydney Morning Herald 16 January 2008 In popular culture The tunnels which had been prepared as an air raid shelter were also used by the ABC TV as a location for one episode of the TV series Police Rescue in the early 1990s. In the episode, a boy who had fallen down a storm drain is rescued. There is also a large bell in one of the tunnels. According to one source, the ABC used this bell to simulate the sound of Big Ben for use in a TV series during the 1960s, but that information has not been verified. Another source suggests that the bell was installed by Nigel Helyer in 1992 as a work of art. The piece, titled \\"An UnRequited Place\\", was part of the Working in Public project created by ArtSpace Sydney, and was a combination of the physical sculpture, performance and audio broadcast.An UnRequited Place Sonic Objects For 21 days the sound of the bell tolling at midnight was broadcast by the ABC. The platforms were used as a shooting location in 2003 film The Matrix Revolutions.

Platforms and services  Heritage listing  St James station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The station is of State significance because, along with Museum, it was the first underground station in Australia and demonstrates the adaptation of the London tube-style station to the Australian situation. The station is well constructed, proportioned and detailed. The station complex is an important part of the larger Sydney Harbour Bridge and the electrified City Underground Railway scheme and has associations with prominent persons such as JJC Bradfield, chief engineer and designer of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and city underground and organisations such as the Department of Railways and represents the culmination of many years of political lobbying for a city railway system. The construction of the city underground and position of St James station encouraged the retail and commercial development of the Sydney CBD in the late 1920s and 1930s, with large department stores constructed around the stations. The station head house building is a fine and largely intact example of a small-scale Inter-War Stripped Classical style building which adds to the general character of the immediate area. It has significance as one of two buildings of its type and style remaining in the city railway system (the other being Museum Station entrance) and is a rare example of this type of station building. The underground platforms and concourse retain many original features and provide one of the most ornate station interiors in the NSW railway system. Disused platforms demonstrate the grand plans of the 1930s railway network of Bradfield, while the air raid shelter areas in the southern tunnels are rare surviving elements of Sydney's World War II defences. Individual elements, such as the tiling, ornate stairs, lights and clocks add to the ambience of the station, while the Chateau Tanunda neon advertising sign at the Elizabeth Street entrance is a rare surviving example of a 1930s neon sign in Sydney.
