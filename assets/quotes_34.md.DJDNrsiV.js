She says she decided to become an opera singer when she was twelve after being inspired by a film version of Madama Butterfly with Maria Cebotari in the lead role. Her mother had taken her to the cinema as a treat in celebration of an excellent school report. In 1943 her parents separated. That same year women with children were evacuated from the bombed out centre of Berlin, and the Frankes were sent to the Spreewald region roughly 90 km (50 miles) to the east of the city. Appreciative of her new surroundings, she lived out the rest of her childhood in and around the village of where her mother at one stage served as local mayor and registrar. Renate's first taste of musical performance came in L√ºbben as a member of the school and church choir. She was a pupil at the Paul-Gerhardt-Gymnasium, a six kilometer (four mile) cycle journey from her home at Ragow. In Berlin she had attended a single-sex school, and the Paul-Gerhardt-Gymnasium provided her first experience of mixed gender schooling: fifty years later she would still be in touch with two friends ‚Äì a tenor and a bass ‚Äì with whom she had formed a school singing trio. The region had ended up administered as part of the Soviet occupation zone, which in October 1949 was relaunched as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). In 1950 her mother arranged for a meeting with Waltraud Waldeck, a local singer and singing teacher who declared that Renate had a natural singing voice and should take singing lessons. She had already been encouraged with her singing at school, and now Waltraud Waldeck became Renate Franke's first \\"private\\" singing teacher. Franke trained and then worked as a dentists' assistant in order to finance the singing lessons and satisfy her mother's insistence that she should have a \\"proper trade\\". (Had the singing career not blossomed, she might have qualified a dentist.) Later she worked in the local theatre, walking up and down the 150 steps in the auditorium with a large tray full of cigarettes and chocolates for sale pressed against her stomach. Meanwhile she studied privately with the internationally known Coloratura soprano, Maria Ivog√ºn in Berlin and later, after moving to Vienna, with Maria Hittorf. In 1953 her mother entered her in a local talent competition. She sang \\"Lied der Nachtigall\\" (\\"Song of the Nightingale\\") by Franz Grothe. Winning the contest, she was now \\"discovered\\" by the RIAS, an American sponsored radio station set up in West Berlin to provide an alternative source of broadcast news and entertainment. (Berlin's existing broadcasting organisation had ended up in the Soviet controlled sector.) She quickly established a singing career as a radio \\"schlager singer\\", and then broadened her scope to include film music. It was around this time that she changed her professional name from Renate Franke to Renate Holm, in order the avoid confusion with the established Schlager singer . During the mid-1950s Holm appears in several music and Heimatfilms , becoming popular with cinema audiences in German-speaking parts of Europe. Her profile was further enhanced by operetta recordings and radio broadcasts. Then, in 1957, she was engaged by Hubert Marischka to work at the Vienna Volksoper. At the time she had recently received an invitation to star as Eliza Doolittle in the German-language premier of My Fair Lady at the Theater des Westens in Berlin, but by now her sights had already for several years been a firmly set on a career as an opera singer rather than on musicals. Renate Holm had never been to Vienna and there was something a little dreamlike about the prospect. She had recently acquired her first car, and with her mother in the passenger seat she drove there over the Pass (the West Autobahn into the city from the west not yet having been completed). She made her Volksoper debut with the lead soprano part as Princess Helene in Walzertraum by Oscar Straus. Following the death of Stalin and a difficult negotiation between the wartime allies, the Soviet Union had agreed to end the four-power occupation of Austria in 1955: but two years later Vienna remained an impoverished city. Despite her substantial reputation and impressive earning power in Berlin, at the start Holm earned barely 300 Marks a month at the Viennese Volksoper. She had, she later told an interviewer, moved to Vienna only for artistic reasons (\\"Das habe ich wirklich nur wegen der Kunst so gemacht\\"). In professional terms Renate Holm's big breakthrough came when she switched to the Vienna State Opera. Her debut performance here, in 1960, was as the fianc√©e Gretchen in Wildsch√ºtz. She was a member of the ensemble for twenty-seven years, from 1964 till 1991. It was under the direction of \\"the doctor\\", Karl B√∂hm that she made her first State Opera, appearances but it was Herbert von Karajan who offered her the permanent contract, and under his direction that she enjoyed a stream of successes. Although it is the professional relationship with Karajan that is more widely celebrated, she was also able to advise him over a personal problem which arose when the maestro acquired a donkey which his wife found impossible to control. Once she had been talent-spotted by Karajan, Renate Holm appeared in many of the world's great opera houses, performing alongside the great stars of her generation. Frequent stage partners included Rudolf Schock, Fritz Wunderlich, Hermann Prey and Peter Minich. Holm's artistic career has lasted for more than fifty years, but she has remained faithful to Vienna's Popular Opera (\\"Volksoper\\") and the Vienna State Opera. She has been resident in Austria for more than sixty years. In 1971 she was bestowed with the honorific title \\"√ñsterreichische Kammers√§ngerin\\", nominated for this badge of establishment recognition by the State Opera. Her wide-ranging repertoire has embraced the classical operatic mainstream, operettas and modern music theatre, along with songs (\\"Lieder\\") and concert arias. She has made a speciality of Wienerlieder (literally, \\"Viennese songs\\"). Her numerous operatic recordings were made not just for the mainstream record companies such as EMI, Decca and Polydor, but also for the radio. In particular, Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR) have made many recordings featuring Renate Holm with the conductor and operetta specialist Franz Marszalek: these include such rarities as \\"Wenn Liebe erwacht\\" (When Love Awakens) by Eduard K√ºnneke. In 1986 and 1987, on the recommendation of (who had founded it), she served as president of the \\"Weinviertler Kultursommer\\"Irene Suchy: Wein. Wetter und Gesang. Musik. In: Mella Waldstein und Manfred Horvath (Hrsg.): Das Weinviertel. Mehr als Idylle. Jahrbuch Volkskultur N√ñ, 2013, pp. 236‚Äì243. and under its auspices heded up master classes in singing at its annual summer arts event festivals between 1983 and 1990. Renate Holm has continued to give concerts during the present century. She participates in festivals such as the in Germany, and in 2006 she took the role of Viktoria in Mich h√§tten Sie sehen sollen (If you'd only seen me) at the Theater in der Josefstadt (Vienna) which had its premier in September 2006. She also remains in demand as a teacher of singing and as a jury member in international competitions. Since 2009 she has chaired the kuratotium of the Berlin based \\"Europ√§ische Kulturwerkstatt\\". She lives for most of the year in Vienna, and has for many years hosted cultural events at the 350 year old water mill at Altenmarkt im Thale (north of Vienna), which she acquired back in 1966.  Personal  Renate Holm is a grand-daughter of General Field Marshall Karl von B√ºlow (1846‚Äì1921). Renate Holm married Horst-Wolfgang Haase in 1965. The marriage lasted seven years.

She is best known as variously the translator, collaborator and writer of The Fairy Books, a series of 25 collections of folk and fairy tales for children she published with her husband, Andrew Lang, between 1889 and 1913. The best known of these are the Rainbow Fairy Books, a series of twelve collections of fairy tales each assigned a different colour. Early life and education Lang was born 8 March 1851 in Clifton, Bristol, the youngest daughter and seventh child of Charles Thomas Alleyne (1798‚Äì1872), a plantation owner in Barbados, and his wife, Margaret. She described a \\"sternly repressed childhood\\" dictated by her much older parents. She received a \\"usual desultory education as a day girl at a fashionable school of the period in Clifton\\" before she met her husband, Scots writer Andrew Lang. She married Andrew Lang on 13 April 1875, in Clifton, Gloucestershire. Lang had to leave his fellowship at Merton College, Oxford in order to marry her, as the college's quota of tutors given leave to marry had already been filled. After marrying, they lived and worked in Kensington, London.Kelly, Stuart.\\"Andrew Lang: the life and times of a prolific talent\\", The Scotsman, 2012.Ed. Newton, Michael. 'Andrew Lang, Prince Prigin'. Victorian Fairy Tales. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015. p. 425. The young couple quickly joined literary and artistic social circles in London and Edinburgh. Among their lifelong friends were the Earl and Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne, the parents of Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, mother of the future Queen Elizabeth II. Years later, Elizabeth, Duchess of York granted Alleyne permission to dedicate a reprint of Andrew Lang's The Chronicles of Pantouflia to the young Princess Elizabeth. The Fairy Books The authorship and translation of the Coloured Fairy Books is often and incorrectly attributed to Lang's husband alone. According to literary critic Anita Silvey, \\"The irony of [Andrew] Lang's life and work is that although he wrote for a profession ‚Äî literary criticism; fiction; poems; books and articles on anthropology, mythology, history, and travel [...] he is best recognized for the works he did not write.\\"Anita Silvey, Children's Books and Their Creators, Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1995; p. 387.

However, as Andrew acknowledges in a preface to The Lilac Fairy Book (1910), \\"The fairy books have been almost wholly the work of Mrs. Lang, who has translated and adapted them from the French, German, Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, Catalan, and other languages.\\" Lang, Andrew. 'Preface'. The Lilac Fairy Book, 1910. Although Andrew is often credited with selecting the stories in the Fairy Books, most of the work was done by Nora. She and a team of other writers, who were mostly women and included May Kendall and Violet Hunt, translated these into English and adapted them to suit Victorian and Edwardian notions of propriety.

Further volumes of stories published from 1908 to 1912 are credited as written by \\"Mrs. Lang\\", such as The Red Book of Heroes (1909)The Red Book of Heroes, 1909 and The Book of Saints and Heroes (1912)The Book of Saints and Heroes, 1912. Originally, the Langs only intended to publish one collection of fairy stories (the first was The Blue Fairy Book, published in 1889), but the popularity of each subsequent volume led to another.Silvey, Anita. The Essential Guide to Children's Books. p. 247. Critics and educational researches of the day had previously judged fairy tales' \\"unreality, brutality, and escapism to be harmful for young readers, while holding that such stories were beneath the serious consideration of those of mature age\\"Roger Lancelyn Green, \\"Andrew Lang in Fairyland\\", in: Sheila Egoff, G. T. Stubbs, and L. F. Ashley, eds., Only Connect: Readings on Children's Literature, New York, Oxford University Press; second edition, 1980; p. 250.. The Langs' collections did much to shift this public perception of fairy stories as unsuitable for children and unworthy of critical analysis. Influence The books have also influenced generations of writers since. Other children's authors, including E. Nesbit, Robert Louis Stevenson, Rudyard Kipling, and Arthur Conan Doyle, were influenced by the Langs' books. Silvey, Anita. The Essential Guide to Children's Books. p. 247. J. R. R.

Formed in mid-1941, the division fought in the Continuation War against Finland in Karelia until the beginning of 1943, when it transferred to the Southwestern Front in Ukraine. After fighting in the Crimean Offensive in the spring of 1944, the division was transferred to the Baltics and advanced westward into East Prussia at the end of the war. Postwar, the division was withdrawn to Crimea, downsized into a separate rifle brigade, and disbanded.  History   World War II  The 263rd Rifle Division began forming on 10 July 1941 at Vologda in the Arkhangelsk Military District. It included the 993rd, 995th, and 997th Rifle Regiments, as well as the 853rd Artillery Regiment. In December 1941, the division became part of the Karelian Front. It spent most of the next 14 months with 26th Army facing Finnish troops north of Lake Onega in the Continuation War. In January 1943, the division was withdrawn to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command (RVGK), and relocated south to the Southwestern Front. On 11 June, Colonel Pavel Volosatykh took command of the division, which fought in the Donbass Strategic Offensive during the summer of 1943 as part of the front's 6th Army, and on 23 September it was transferred to the RVGK. Soviet troops crossing the Sivash into Crimea At the end of October, the 263rd became part of the 4th Ukrainian Front's 28th Army and fought in the Melitopol Offensive. On 5 November, the division moved across the Sivash, joining the 51st Army's 54th Rifle Corps in its Crimean bridgehead. It fought with the army in the Crimean Offensive in the spring of 1944, breaking through the German defensive lines on the southern coast of the Sivash and capturing Dzhankoy. On 16 April, its units captured Bakhchysarai and reached the approaches to Sevastopol. For its actions, the division was awarded the honorific \\"Sivash\\" on 24 April, and Volosatykh received the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 16 May. He was promoted to corps command on 18 April and was replaced by Major General Alexander Pykhtin. The division subsequently fought in the recapture of Sevastopol. At the end of May it was assigned to the 2nd Guards Army when the entire front was transferred to the RVGK. The division moved north with the 2nd Guards Army and joined the 1st Baltic Front in July 1944 during the advance into southern Lithuania, the Siauliai Offensive. The division then fought in the Riga Offensive from September and the Memel Offensive in October. Between 5 and 12 October, it broke through strong fortified defenses on the Dubysa River and developed the breakthrough into a 120-kilometer advance in a week that brought it to the Neman River. In November, the 263rd was transferred to the 43rd Army. On 22 November, Pykhtin was sent to military academy courses and was replaced by Colonel Kornily Cherepanov. In January 1945, the army became part of the 3rd Belorussian Front, fighting in the Insterburg‚ÄìK√∂nigsberg Offensive, part of the East Prussian Offensive. Between 20 and 23 January, the division captured Tilsit, Heinrichswalde, and Labiau. The 263rd then fought in the Battle of K√∂nigsberg, taking in part in the capture of the city on 9 April. After the fall of the city, the 43rd Army and the division joined the 2nd Belorussian Front in East Prussia. At the end of the war the 263rd was still with the 43rd Army's 54th Rifle Corps near the German Baltic coast.  Postwar  The division remained with the 54th Rifle Corps in the Northern Group of Forces after the end of the war. Around late 1945 and early 1946, the 263rd was withdrawn to Feodosia in the Tauric Military District with the 54th Rifle Corps.

Frommer's Krak√≥w Day by Day. John WIley & Sons. . Background In 1850 the city of Krak√≥w was still heavily reliant on wood as construction material. Most of the 1700 buildings in the city were wooden, and the masonry ones had many wooden elements. The city had poor water infrastructure, and no full-time fire service. The fire The fire started on 18 July on city outskirts around the Krupnicza Street, in the grain mill area. The fire is attributed to an accident caused by a miller and a smith, who while fixing some equipment started a fire in a mill building which then spiraled out of control. The fire grew due to strong winds which spread it to nearby buildings, affecting the city center. Within hours it affected over eight streets, though it was stopped from spreading further. Jagiellonian University students prevented it from causing more than superficial damage to the university's library. The spread of the fire was stopped within one day, but it took several more days and military's assistance to eliminate it completely. Main Square, on both sides of Grodzka Street, extending east and west to the Planty Park. The fire caused the destruction of approximately one tenth of the city: 153 buildings, two palaces, two or three monasteries, and four churches. Aftermath The fire was responsible for subsequent economic stagnation in the city. The fire also made the city government increase the fire fighting budget, though the first (voluntary) fire service would not be established until 1865.

It was the first world's fair held in New Zealand. It opened on 12 January and ran until 6 May 1865. Organisation Following the Bazaar and Industrial Exhibition of 1862, held in Dunedin, a group of gentlemen formed a committee for the promotion of a similar exhibition to be held on a larger scale in Dunedin in 1865. An application was made in February 1863 to the Governor requesting the formation of a Royal Commission, which was granted in May. The Provincial Government provided the sum of ¬£4,000 for the aid of general purposes and another ¬£4,000 to build a suitable building.John Hyde Harris was president of the executive, James Hector was commissioner and juror, Alfred Eccles the secretary and Thomas Forrester building superintendent. Architecture A low-level site on King Street was secured and a contract was let to Messrs. George Cornwell and Edward Horsman on November 11, 1863 for ¬£10,250 to erect the Main Building. There was a large two-story stone Italianate building with clock tower and a series of annexes all designed by Mason and Clayton, with a central courtyard derived from Fowler's design of Covent Garden market. It was not completely finished when the fair opened. International Participation From the America came exhibits from Canada and the United States. From Europe came exhibits from Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Great Britain, and the Netherlands. The sole Asian exhibiting nation was that of India. From Oceania, the colonies of New Zealand were well represented as were New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, and Victoria. Altogether there came 1,598 exhibits from about 700 exhibitors. Legacy Exhibits from the exhibition provided the opening collection of the colonial museum, and added to the collection at the Otago Museum, and the main building was converted into a new hospital for Dunedin. The old annex at the rear of the building was torn down in the mid-1890s, and a fire in the tower in 1897 almost destroyed the entire building. The old exhibition hospital finally was torn down in 1933. After the exhibition, the collections were put into store and the art works were included in formation of Otago Society of Arts in 1876.

In it Galileo conjectured that comets were not physical bodies but atmospheric effects like the aurora borealis. Galileo's interest in comets Frontespiece of Discorso delle Comete Three comets were seen in Europe in 1618. The first appeared in October, the second in mid-November, and the third and brightest at the end of November. After publishing Letters on Sunspots in 1613, Galileo had largely stopped working on telescopic astronomy and he was to publish nothing further based on the observation and recording of data for astronomical events. In 1616 the heliocentric views of Copernicus were declared formally heretical and Galileo was warned by Cardinal Bellarmine to neither teach nor defend them. After this he was silent on astronomical matters for several years. However Virginio Cesarini wrote to him asking for his views on the 1618 comets, as did Archduke Leopold of Austria and Domenico Bonsi, who wrote to him that the court mathematicians of Louis XIII of France all wanted to know his opinion on the phenomenon. Galileo had not observed the comets as he was unwell in the autumn of 1618. However he learned that the Collegio Romano had held four lectures on the comets, respectively by a theologian, a mathematician, a philosopher and a rhetorician. The mathematician was Orazio Grassi, a pupil of Maelcote and Grienberger. Grassi argued that the absence of parallax meant that the comets must be very distant from the Earth, and he suggested that they existed beyond the Moon. Soon afterwards the lecture was published in Rome as an anonymous pamphlet entitled \\"De Tribus Cometis Anni MDCXVIII\\". In March 1619, Galileo received a letter from Giovanni Battista Rinuccini alerting him to the fact that some people outside the Jesuit order were claiming that Grassi's lecture on comets provided a definitive proof that Copernicus' ideas were wrong. The evident threat to Copernicus, whom Galileo could no longer defend, prompted him to attack the Tychonic ideas now popular among the Jesuits with particular force. Galileo received a copy of Grassi's lecture and was very angered by it. The notes he scribbled in the margin of his copy are full of insults - 'pezzo d'asinaccio' ('piece of utter stupidity'), 'bufolaccio' ('buffoon'), 'villan poltrone' ('wicked idiot'), 'balordone' ('bumbling idiot'). He decided to respond to it through his friend Mario Guiducci, who wanted a topic for his planned address to the Accademia Fiorentina. Guiducci read the Discourse on Comets at the Accademia Fiorentina in May 1619 and it was published the next month.Mario Biagioli, Galileo Courtier:The Practice of Science in the Culture of Absolutism, University of Chicago Press 1993 pp.62-3 In public, Galileo insisted that Guiducci, and not he, was the author of the Discourse on Comets. Despite Galileo's public protestations, there is no doubt whatever that he was the main author of the Discourse on Comets. The manuscript is largely in Galileo's handwriting, and the sections in Guiducci's hand have been revised and corrected by Galileo. Conjecture Grassi responded to the Discourse on Comets as if it was propounding a theory about their origin, but Galileo made clear that he was not doing this. Rather, as in his Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina four years previously, his purpose was to insist that the burden of proof lay with those who had ideas that did not accord with his own. He intended to criticise pedantic thinkers who believed they had easily found a definitive answer to something, disregarding the fact that nature may have many possible ways of producing the same effect. He conceded that he knew very little about comets; his point was to expose those who were convinced that they knew the answers. The Discourse does not attempt to offer clear proofs of Galileo's conjectures, (unlike his Letters on Sunspots or Discourse on Floating Bodies); instead it focuses on arguments which undermine Grassi's contentions, forcing him to examine the phenomenon of comets more thoroughly and produce more substantial evidence for his argument that they are real. Arguments in the Discourse The Discourse on Comets, although formally a response to Grassi, was a rebuttal of the arguments made by Tycho Brahe. It advanced the proposition that the absence of parallax observable with comets was due not to their great distance from the Earth, but to the fact that they were not real objects; they were probably atmospheric effects. Galileo (through Guiducci) also argued against Tycho's case for comets having uniform, circular paths. Instead, he maintained, their paths were straight. Throughout, he expressed surprise that mathematicians at the Collegio (where Guiducci had been educated) could have adopted Tycho's positions so uncritically when his arguments were so poor. As well as attacking Grassi, the Discourse also continued an earlier dispute with Christoph Scheiner about sunspots, belittling the illustrations in Scheiner's book as 'badly coloured and poorly drawn.'Eileen Reeves & Albert Van Helden, (translators) On Sunspots, The University of Chicago Press, 2010 p.320 Diagram showing Galileo's conjecture that comets travelled in straight linesAgainst classical authority: The Discourse opens with a review of the opinions on comets of Aristotle, Anaxagoras, Democritus, Hippocrates of Chios and Seneca the Younger. By showing how one contradicts the other, and indeed how Aristotle contradicts even himself, Galileo sought \\"to inculcate a certain skepticism and distrust of dogmatic authority, to encourage observation and mathematical analysis in preference to philosophical speculation, and to emphasise the vast extent of the unknown in comparison with the little men had gained as certain knowledge.\\" Against the assumption that parallax can measure all visible objects: He cites phenomena such as haloes, rainbows and parhelia, none of which have parallax, and then refers to Pythagoras in suggesting that comets may be an optical illusion caused by light being reflected by a vertically rising column of vapour. Against misunderstanding of the telescope: Galileo refutes the claim by Grassi that when looking through a telescope one sees 'nearby objects are enlarged very much, and more distant ones less and less in proportion to their greater distance.' He demonstrates at considerable length that this is untrue, and urges the scholars of the Collegio Romano to correct such a serious fault in their understanding. Against Tycho: The final part of the Discourse is an assault on Tycho and his arguments. First he points out the implausibility of there being a celestial sphere devoted to comets, as they move in different directions and at different speeds. Next he argues from the apparent motion and speed of comets that they are more likely to travel in straight lines than in a circle, as Tycho had suggested. Contrasts in Galileo's views In the Discourse on Comets Galileo argued positions different to those in some of his other works. * Smoothness of heavenly bodies: The standard cosmology of Galileo's time, based on Aristotle's Physics, held that the stars and planets were perfectly smooth. Galileo had upset this view by proving that the Moon had mountains and valleys on its surface, and that the Sun had spots. Nevertheless, in Discourse on Comets Galileo argued that, on the supposition that the heavenly spheres were perfect, smooth and polished, Aristotle must be wrong in suggesting that comets were caused by friction fires in the celestial spheres. Grassi pointed this out in his reply to Galileo, Libra astronomica ac philosophica. * Planetary rotation and atmospheric phenomena: In Letters on Sunspots Galileo claimed that sunspots were similar to clouds on Earth, carried around by the rotation of the Sun. In contrast, in Discourse on Comets Galileo conjectured that the atmospheric conditions that might produce comets as an optical effect were static and were not carried round by the Earth's motion. * The origins of comets: Although in the Discourse on Comets Galileo argued that the celestial origin of comets was by no means certain, he had argued the opposite case in August, 1612, in his Second Letter on Sunspots. Here he referred to Tycho's theory of the origin of comets to support his view that mutability in the heavens was not confined to the regions below the Moon: \\"As if to remove all doubt from our minds, a host of observations come to us to teach us that the comets are generated in the celestial regions.\\" However, by 1632, in his Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, Galileo was taking a different view: \\"As far as the comets are concerned, I, for my part, care little whether they are generated below or above the moon, nor have I ever set much store in Tycho's verbosity.\\" * Artistotelian thinking: Since 1611, scholars of the Jesuit order had been bound by their General Claudio Acquaviva to defend Aristotle's views on natural philosophy. In many instances (e.g. in Sidereus Nuncius and Letters on Sunspots) Galileo argued against the received Aristotelian model and Jesuits who defended it. However, in the Discourse on Comets Galileo defended a view which posed no challenge to the main tenets of Aristotelian cosmology, while Grassi had in fact departed from the strictly Aristotelian view and embraced Tycho Brahe. Galileo adopted this line of argument in order to highlight the weaknesses of Tycho's system as a replacement for Ptolemy. Continuing dispute The Jesuit order of which Grassi was a member was very angry at the expression of Galileo's view in the Discourse on Comets. The pamphlet was a major factor in the alienation of the Jesuits from Galileo, who had previously been broadly supportive of his ideas, even despite his attacks on Christoph Scheiner. While Guiducci and Galileo were working in the Discourse, a second anonymous Jesuit pamphlet appeared in Milan - Assemblea Celeste Radunata Nuovamente in Parnasso Sopra la Nuova Cometa. This argued for the new model of the universe proposed by Tycho Brahe and against the traditional cosmology of Aristotle. Guiducci and Galileo collaborated on a response to this as well, which set out the arguments for a heliocentric model. The debate continued when, in Perugia later in 1619, Grassi published a reply to the Discourse in La Libra Astronomica ac Philosophica under the pen-name Lotario Sarsi Sigensano. This work dismissed Guiducci as a mere 'copyist' for Galileo, and attacked Galileo's ideas directly. While the Accademia dei Lincei were considering what tone a reply from Galileo ought to take, Guiducci replied directly to Grassi in the Spring of 1620. The reply was formally addressed to another Jesuit, Father Tarquinio Galluzzi, his old rhetoric master. Guiducci countered the various arguments Grassi had put forward against Galileo, describing some of Grassi's experiments as 'full of errors and not without a hint of fraud.' Guiducci concluded with an attempt to reconcile experimental evidence with theological arguments, but firmly asserted the primacy of data gathered through observation. Galileo was very pleased with Guiducci's efforts, proposing him for membership of the Accademia dei Lincei in May 1621 (although he did not actually become a member until 1625). Galileo's final response in the dispute with Grassi was Il Saggiatore (The Assayer) which he published in 1623. Grassi replied in 1626 with Ratio ponderum librae et simbellae which focused on doctrinal issues rather than scientific questions. Having defeated Grassi on the points he considered important, Galileo declined to publish anything further on the topic.

The surgeon Khudadat Rafibeyli was appointed as the first minister who graduated Medical faculty of Kharkhov University. The government developed a comprehensive plan to improve medical service to provide with state-funded medical service for residents, open new medical centers, construct medical warehouses and laboratory buildings, besides necessary equipment was acquired by the order of the Ministry. Government tried to improve fighting against epidemics, upgrade the medical service in regions with providing medical staff and medication. More than 30 hospitals were operating in regions during the ADR. Outpatient services were provided free of charge in the villages. The main tasks of the existing rural hospitals and medical stations were the hospitalization of infectious patients and neutralization of the disease areas. Taking into account the insufficiency, as there was only a doctor for 75 thousand residents, Parliament decided on opening 35 new hospitals and 56 medical assistant points and providing 43 billion manats for that in order to expand hospital network in rural areas. State pharmacies and an analytical laboratory were set up in Baku to make drugs, bacteriological preparations, treatment syrups, and to conduct medical-legal examinations. A central warehouse was established to provide healthcare service with medicines and medical supplies properly and timely. Students were granted to study medical studies abroad by the Government of the Republic.  Soviet period  After ADR collapsed and Azerbaijan became a part of Soviet Union, health system started to develop as a part of Soviet healthcare. Newly formed People‚Äôs Commissariat of Healthcare of Azerbaijan by Soviet authorities benefited from the traditions established during the ADR period. The main task of the Commissariat was to fight against infectious diseases such as plague, chickenpox, malaria, and measles.Mohsun Gadirli was appointed as a healthcare commissar (healthcare minister) to carry out reforms in this area in November 1921. During his term a unified healthcare system was created, special attention was paid to personnel training, improvement of health service in rural areas, improvement of drug supply of the population, development of medical services for women and children.Hospitals, outpatient clinics, pharmacies and other medical institutions were established in the centers of different regions and in larger settlements. Implementing the decrees on nationalization of drugstores, distribution of free food for children, and free medical care for the population was started. Considering the need for medical staff and specialized scientific-research institutions in various fields of medicine, People‚Äôs Health Commissar of Azerbaijan Mohsun Gadirli launched a sanitary- epidemiological organization under the supervision of A.Alibeyov, the state sanitary-epidemiology inspector. Later on Scientific-Research Center of Virology, Microbiology and Hygiene was established based on previous organization. In 1923 the Institute of Skin and Venereal diseases in Baku, and in 1926 Central Skin and Venereal Dispensary was established. In 1927 the Institution of Mother and Child Protection, in 1931 The Institution of Medical Parasitology and Tropical Diseases, in 1935 the Institution of Resorts and Physiotherapy, and in 1941 the Institution of Roentgenology, Radiology and Oncology were opened. After the World War 2 rehabilitation of the disabled war veterans were one of the top issues for the state authorities. The Scientific Research Institute of Orthopedics and Reproductive Surgery was established in 1946 for that purpose. In 1960-70s a number of healthcare facilities including Urology Hospital, Diagnostic Center, Neurosurgical Center, Toxicology Center, Family Planning Center were established within a short period of time; construction of new building for National Center of Oncology and new complex for the Scientific-Research Institution of Ophthalmology was started. The context for the healthcare system in Azerbaijan Republic inherited Soviet Semashko model, which was a tax-based system with its highly centralized planning of resources and personnel based on a hierarchical structure. Soviet health system was owned by the state, planned and managed centrally. All healthcare personnel were employed by the state, and private practice was not allowed.  Current healthcare system  After independence in 1991 the healthcare system of Azerbaijan confronted economic difficulties and therefore, quality and access to medical service declined. The traditions inherited from Semashko model still remain in health structure of the country. Government is trying to address the problems faced by healthcare sphere of the country with implementing different reforms, projects and getting support from international organizations. Healthcare system in Azerbaijan has been improving in recent years with the support of World Bank. New medical establishments are constructed, upgraded medical equipment is provided and medical staff is trained in the framework of the projects.  Public healthcare  However, there are significant improvements in healthcare system; Azerbaijani society suffers from inefficient and underfunded public healthcare. Public hospitals are run by the state and medical care is offered free of charge for Azerbaijani residents. Pediatric and adult polyclinics offering outpatient services and specialized clinics/hospitals offering inpatient services are the public facilities. These establishments are mostly located in Baku.  Private healthcare  Private healthcare in Azerbaijan experienced enlargement recently. Health tourism Azerbaijan is a target of health tourists from Iran, Turkey, Georgia and Russia. The Bona Dea International Hospital in Baku was built in 2018 to attract international custom, and has staff from various European countries.  Pharmacies  A number of pharmacies (aptek) are operating in the main cities of the country, especially in Baku most of them are open 24/7. alt=thumb395x395pxHealth expenditure per capita in Azerbaijan between 1995-2014 in comparison with neighboring countries Data from World Bank  Organizational structure  It was one of the main functions of the state to ensure the health care for the population which was mentioned in the 1995 Constitution. The healthcare system is mainly divided between Ministry of Healthcare and local authorities. Central institutions, a number of facilities including republican hospitals, research institutes and sanitary epidemiology system belong to the Ministry. Local hospitals, district polyclinics and specialized dispensaries are owned by district and city administrations. Other ministries also manage health services in addition to their main service, such as Ministries of Transport, Defense, Customs with the hospitals of Railway, Defense and Customs respectively. The Medical University was also under the responsibility of Ministry of healthcare, but after a few years of gaining independence, it was granted autonomy. The current Statute of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Azerbaijan is confirmed by a decree signed by Heydar Aliyev on December 29, 1998. For the beginning of 2017 there are 569 hospitals, 1758 ambulatory-polyclinics, 32.2 thousand physicians in the country.http://www.azstat.org/MESearch/details  Healthcare reforms  The Government Commission was established to organize and conduct health care reforms according to the Resolution No 760 (March 13, 1998) of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan. It includes the ministers of economy, finance, justice ministries, heads of National Bank, Social Protection Fund, Trade Unions Confederation, State Insurance Supervison Service, responsible employees of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan. By the Decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan No. 49 (December 29, 1998) \\"The Statue of State Commission for Healthcare Reforms in the Republic of Azerbaijan\\" was approved.

Healthcare projects  After gaining independence, the healthcare system in Azerbaijan faced with challenges because of ongoing war and economic downturn. International organizations (USAID, UNICEF, WHO, World Bank) started to help Azerbaijan in the field of healthcare. Heydar Aliyev Foundation is also initiating projects to support healthcare. Those projects are dealing with diabetic, thalassemia patients and their treatments, organizing blood donation, improving health condition of mothers and their babies. Projects for applying modern information technologies to the healthcare system were implemented as ‚ÄúElectronic Azerbaijan‚Äù State Program. ‚ÄúElectronic health card of citizens‚Äù system was launched in the framework of this program. Despite all these developments, healthcare system in Azerbaijan still requires attention, and there are some important issues to be solved. For that reason, major challenges facing healthcare sector are highlighted in ‚ÄúAzerbaijan: View at future‚Äù Development Conception approved by the Decree of the President of Azerbaijan.

One of them was establishment The State Agency on Mandatory Health Insurance under the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan according to the Order No. 2592 dated 27 December 2007 by the President of Azerbaijan. Regulation and structure of the Agency was approved by the President of Azerbaijan according to the Decree No. 765 (15 February 2016). Therefore, new system will provide health insurance fund for pensioners, non-working citizens and those receiving social benefits financed by the state. Azerbaijan introduced pilot compulsory health insurance project according to the Decree (2016 November 29) of the President of Azerbaijan on \\"Measures for ensuring implementation activities of mandatory health insurance pilot project in Mingachavir and Yevlakh.

It is focused on Early music, Baroque music and music of the Classical period. Intended to showcase the work of Nikolaus Harnoncourt in his hometown, it grew to locations in the region and survived his death.  History  Kurt Jungwirth, as Kulturlandesrat responsible for cultural politics in the state of Styria, wanted to tie conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt closer to his hometown Graz. The focus of the first Styriarte was Johann Sebastian Bach, with Harnoncourt's Concentus Musicus Wien playing a leading role. The festival was directed by Andrea Herberstein and Wolfgang Schuster, a member of the Wiener Philharmoniker. The first festival was staged in the summer of 1985. In 1987, Harnoncourt also conducted the Chamber Orchestra of Europe. The event Ein Fest f√ºr Haydn (A feast for Haydn) in Schloss Eggenberg became a success with the audience. In 1988, Christopher Widauer succeeded Herberstein. A year later, the baroque church of Stainz was the first festival venue outside Graz, where Harnoncourt conducted concerts with the Concentus Musicus and the Arnold Schoenberg Chor. In 1991, Mathis Huber succeeded Widauer. In 1992, the focus changed from one composer per year to a motto. Jordi Savall became another internationally known conductor performing for the festival. Stift Rein Venues of the festival were later also the R√∂mersteinbruch (Roman quarry) in Wagna, the Stift St. Lambrecht, Stift Rein and other locations in Styria, including the newly opened from 2003, and the from 2007. In 2005, a staged production of Bizet's Carmen with Harnoncourt received international attention. From 2007, when the motto was Wanted: Europa, the broadcaster ORF aired concerts live. From 2008 the festival followed the model of the Bayreuth Festival and the Metropolitan Opera in New York, offering \\"public viewing\\"; the first work presented was Mozart's Coronation Mass with Harnoncourt in the parish church of Stainz.  Performers  Leading performers of the festival have included, besides Harnoncourt and Savalli, the Quatuor Mosaiques, Armonico Tributo Austria and Il Giardino Armonico. After Harnoncourt's death in 2016, conductors Karina Canellakis,Karina Canellakis on instantencore.com Andr√©s Orozco-Estrada and Jeremie Rhorer appeared in 2016, sharing the planned project to present all Beethoven Symphonies. The number of symphony concerts was reduced from eleven to seven, while the tickets sold stayed almost the same, at 33.000 for 64 events, more than 90% of the available seats.

Led by Turki al Buhamad, the Fighters of the Tribes played a vital role in the Assad government's efforts to retake central and eastern Syria. The militia is affiliated with the pro-Ba'athist branch of the Arab Socialist Movement, and is closely allied with Russia.  History  The \\"Forces of the Fighters of the Tribes\\" were founded by the Arab Socialist Movement as \\"auxiliary force\\" for the Syrian Army at some point during the Syrian Civil War, reportedly during or shortly after the Raqqa campaign (2012‚Äì13). They were organised by Turki al Buhamad, a member of the Arab Socialist Movement's political office who had to flee his native Raqqa Governorate due to persecution by rebel forces. The militia initially counted about 200 fighters, and waged a guerilla campaign for the government in Deir ez-Zor Governorate. Disguised as insurgents, Turki's militants would kidnap actual rebels and hand them over to local security forces. Turki was later sent to Damascus, where he and Omar Adnan al-Alawi, the Arab Socialist Movement's assistant secretary general, began organising new branches of the Tribal Army. While his original followers continued to fight in Deir ez-Zor Governorate, Turki recruited new troops in Homs. The militia's Homs branch took part in operations in the Syrian steppe and Syrian Desert in early 2016, such as the Ithriyah-Raqqa offensive (February‚ÄìMarch 2016), the Palmyra offensive (March 2016), and the Battle of al-Qaryatayn (March‚ÄìApril 2016). By mid-2016, the group fought at the central Syrian frontlines, where government forces were trying to progress toward al-Sukhnah. In course of these operations, disputes erupted among the Tribal Army as members of one of its sub-units, the Druze Bayraq al-Suwayda, felt that the recruitment promises were not being kept. As result, they mutinied and tried to leave Palmyra for their homes in as-Suwayda, but were detained by other Fighters of the Tribes. Eventually, the head of as-Suwayda's NDF intervened in order to ensure that they were released. Later during 2016, the Tribal Army mostly concentrated on operations in and around Aleppo, where they fought in the last phase of the four years-long battle for the city. They helped to fully encircle the rebel-held parts of Aleppo, and then participated in Operation Dawn of Victory that saw the final defeat of the city's rebels. For their good combat performance during these engagements, the militia was praised by Zayd Ali Saleh, head of the security and military committee in Aleppo. Nevertheless, a group of about 500 Fighters of the Tribes proved in the following months to be prone to looting and harassment of Aleppo's civilian population; for this, they were transferred for disciplinary reasons to al-Khafsah. Meanwhile, the rest of the militia fought in the eastern Aleppo countryside against ISIL. Around mid-2017, Turki al Buhamad had managed to recruit another force for the Tribal Army which took part in the Syrian Desert campaign (May‚ÄìJuly 2017) and a government campaign to retake all of central Syria. When the pro-government forces captured several towns at the southern bank of the Euphrates River, most importantly Ghanem al-Ali, the militia was deployed to garrison them. After other government troops had left the area, ISIL launched a major counter-attack. It overran several government positions, forcing the Tribal Army to retreat. About 79 fighters of the militia fled north into SDF-held areas. Carrying white flags, they surrendered to the SDF in order to prevent ISIL from capturing them. The militiamen were then transferred to Koban√Æ while negotiations began between the SDF and government forces for their release. Eventually, however, dozens of these tribal fighters decided to join the SDF instead of returning to the government, as they felt that Turki al Buhamad had abandoned them. The commander had allegedly fled during the ISIL counter-attack while leaving his men behind. In August 2017, a pro-Syrian opposition news site reported that members of Turki's militia had been involved in a shootout with another pro-government group, the Desert Commandos Regiment, in Homs. The clash had allegedly resulted from disputes over control of brothels in the city. By 2018, the Fighters of the Tribes were considered to be among the most important pro-Russian militias in Syria, and vital to the improving fortunes of the Syrian government. According to Jorf News and Nedaa Syria, the Military Intelligence raided the homes of members of the militia and arrested several on charges of corruption in August 2019. Turki al Buhamad allegedly paid the intelligence agencies around 200 million Syrian pounds to avoid arrest himself. The group was contributing troops to a government offensive in northwestern Syria in early 2020.  Organization and recruitment  Besides Turki al Buhamad, the Fighters of the Tribes are also led by his brother Ahmad al Buhamad; both of them are part of the Al Buhamad tribe of Raqqa Governorate. Their militia claims to have thousands of supporters among tribes in central Syria, and its recruits are mostly drawn from eastern Syrian tribal members (such as the Deir ez-Zor and al-Hasakah Governorates), though they also have fighters from the Aleppo, Hama, and as- Suwayda Governorates. Pro-Opposition sources have accused the Fighters of the Tribes of forcibly conscripting and blackmailing people into enlisting. Most of militia's troops are members of the Arab Socialist Movement. In all, the Tribal Army claimed to have about 5,000 fighters by 2017, and are one of the most important tribal militias in Syria. The group is closely allied with and supported by Russia, and is trained by the Russian Armed Forces as well as by Hezbollah fighters. Despite this, the Tribal Army suffers from indiscipline. The militia is also influenced by Iran.

The Network was the precursor of Antioch College's university system, eventually renamed as Antioch University.Hayford, Elizabeth R. \\"Antioch College: A celebrated history and an uncertain future.\\" Wiley, 2011. Formation of The Network Antioch College's expansion beyond its Yellow Springs campus began in the late 1950s. Expansion accelerated in earnest in the mid-1960s when Antioch College President James P. Dixon encouraged the establishment of a series of branch campuses and centers (part of the University Without Walls movement) with the idea of extending the impact of Antioch‚Äôs innovative educational ideas. In addition to locations founded by Antioch faculty, some schools, especially those which sought to serve historically marginalized and underserved communities such as Juarez‚ÄìLincoln University, were added to the Network in order to operate under Antioch College's accreditation. The Network's branches reached beyond traditional college-age students into the realm of adult learners. More than 40 Antioch affiliated \\"learning communities\\" were created into the early 1970s by faculty, as well as by outside community groups, non-profit organizations, and entrepreneurs. One of the earliest expansions was Antioch College's pioneering international program, Antioch Education Abroad (AEA), established in 1957. In February 2016, Antioch University sold AEA to Carleton College which took over operation of the study abroad programs in Cameroon, Europe, and India. Carleton was fortunate to retain the excellent leadership of the programs' faculty directors, all of whom are now members of the faculty at Carleton. The Antioch Graduate School of Education in Putney, Vermont (or Antioch-Putney), was the first campus established with the 1964 purchase of the Putney School of Education. The Graduate School of Education evolved over the years with different names and locations (it moved to Harrisville, Vermont and then Keene, New Hampshire) and became what is now known as Antioch University New England. The Antioch School of Law was a notable campus founded in 1972 and operated until 1988 when it was absorbed into the University of the District of Columbia. Challenges and Contraction While Antioch College and the branches shared common core educational principles, significant cultural and structural differences resulted in a lack of cohesion. Unlike the College, the branches did not have a system of academic tenure. While the Antioch College was a residential liberal arts college, the branches differed significantly with a student body of commuting adult learners. Additionally, Antioch College was governed under a robust model of shared governance, but many of the branches were formed without the input or oversight of ComCil (the core governing body) resulting in a general lack of support for these external enterprises. Academic standards also varied widely among the branches and between the College. Convoluted extensions of The Network complicated the situation. Many of the branches were not originated from Antioch College, but rather as derivatives of the branches themselves, further outside the oversight of the College. Most of the branches had no direct connection to programs or faculty of the College. A primary criticism of The Network was that drew administrative energy away from the College. Compounding these issues was the fact that many of the branches were not financially sound. Cashflow issues and outright financial failures put stress on the College's budget leading to the closure of most of the branches beginning in 1975 and continuing through the late 1980s. Contraction of the Network was executed under President William Birenbaum, noted for his acumen in \\"crisis-type settings,\\" reducing the size of the Network by nearly three-quarters.Noble, Kenneth. \\"A Streamlined Antioch Appears on the Way to Survival\\", The New York Times, November 16, 1980. Retrieved October 10, 2010. Formation of University System Even as the system of branch centers and campuses were being closed, President William Birenbaum also oversaw the formal name change of the corporation to Antioch University in 1978.Antioch College The contracted university consisted of five units in addition to Antioch College. Two of these were housed on the campus of the college: the School for Adult and Experiential Learning, which later became Antioch McGregor, and Antioch Education Abroad, later renamed Antioch International. The College was the center of the University system, but tensions between the different models of education and governance were the source of many rifts. Budgetary structures also proved problematic. The College budget bore many expenses which benefited the entire enterprise, but also caused the College's balance sheet to compare less favorably in relation to other campuses. Separation of Antioch College and Antioch University A major structural shift occurred in 1993 with the creation of the University Chancellor which had leadership over all of Antioch's campuses. Previously the president of Antioch College was the chief officer with provosts of the university campuses reporting directly. The role was first filled by a former president of the College, Alan Guskin, but later by a former president of a university campus. Where the College had previously been central to the university, the structural shift created a reality where the College was just one of many parts, and was actually an outlier which was significantly different from the other campuses. Over time, administration and trustee leaders lost sight of the historic College as the core of the University, and a decision was made to close the original Antioch College. The rationale for closure was that the branch campuses were more financially sustainable than the College which was no longer financially viable (despite accounting inequality which applied university-wide liabilities solely to the College budget). After lengthy negotiation, Antioch College emerged as a newly independent institution due to the efforts of its alumni. Now two separate entities, Antioch College occupies the original campus in Yellow Springs, Ohio and operates in its tradition as a progressive liberal arts college, while Antioch University operates five campuses in addition to an online program and a Ph.D program with residency rotating among its campuses.[Hannah, James. http://archive.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2007/10/22/alumni_scramble_to_keep_antioch_college_open/?page=full Associated Press.

Rabies medication is also very expensive for the average Tanzanian. Context Rabies is a fatal, preventable zoonosis that infects the central nervous system of mammals, caused by the lyssavirus. It is endemic in low income countries, causing an estimated 55,000 human deaths each year with over 98% of these deaths following bites from rabid dogs. Socio- economic effects Cleaveland et al. (2002) estimated Tanzanian human rabies mortality at 1499 deaths per year, including unreported cases. There were only 193 reported cases, or 12% of the true number of people dying of rabies annually. Prevention schemes There have been some efforts to control rabies through vaccination of the disease sources, which include dogs and other wildlife. A study done in two districts of Ngorongoro and Serengeti studied the spread pattern of rabies where wildlife plays a role in disease transmission. Findings indicated that an annual dog vaccination campaign, achieving the WHO-recommended target of 70% coverage, would have a high chance of controlling rabies in Ngorongoro and Serengeti.

The Republican Party had not seriously contested one of Louisiana's Senate seats since Reconstruction, and Republican leaders believed McKeithen's presence in the race could split the Democratic vote. McKeithen ran a populist, agrarian campaign against Johnston, citing his own investment in the state's agriculture industry and attempting to portray Johnston as an urban elitist.

Gallin (born March 25, 1943) is an American medical researcher who has contributed to the understanding of innate immunity but especially chronic granulomatous disease, a phagocyte disorder. Gallin was appointed director of the NIH Clinical Center on May 1, 1994, and served until January 8, 2017. He serves as the chief scientific officer for the Clinical Center and associate director for Clinical Research at the National Institutes of Health. Education and career Gallin was born on March 25, 1943, in New York City, His father was an attorney, and his mother was trained as a social worker, but then became a stay-at-home mom. He graduated from New Rochelle High School in New Rochelle, NY, in 1961. He graduated cum laude from Amherst College in 1965. He earned his M.D. from Cornell Medical College of Cornell University in 1969. After a medical internship and residency at New York University‚Äôs Bellevue Hospital, in 1971 he began postdoctoral training in basic and clinical research in infectious diseases at the National Institutes of Health as a clinical associate in the Laboratory of Clinical Investigation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Gallin returned to New York University's Bellevue Hospital as senior chief medical resident from 1974 to 1975, then came back to NIH. In 1985, he was appointed scientific director for intramural research activities at the NIAID, a position he held for the next nine years. Gallin was the founding chief of NIAID's Laboratory of Host Defenses in 1991 and served as chief of the laboratory for 12 years. He continues as chief of the lab's clinical pathophysiology section. Gallin was the 10th director of the NIH Clinical Center, a position he held for 22 years, the longest serving director. The Clinical Center is the largest hospital focused solely on clinical research and serves the scientific and medical needs of 17 NIH institutes. In 2011, under Gallin's leadership, the Clinical Center was the first hospital to receive the Lasker-Bloomberg Public Service Award. In August 2016, Gallin was appointed to the newly created positions of NIH associate director for clinical research and chief scientific officer for the Clinical Center. These posts report directly to the NIH Director and oversee independent research programs, clinical research training and the scientific review process for all clinical protocols conducted at the NIH. On January 8, 2017, Gallin stepped down as the director of the NIH Clinical Center to focus full-time as the chief scientific officer of the Clinical Center and NIH associate director for clinical research. Gallin served as Assistant Surgeon General of the United States Public Health Service and retired from the USPHS as a rear admiral. Gallin has published or co-authored more than 355 articles in scientific journals and has edited two textbooks: Inflammation, Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates (Lippincott, Williams, and Wilkins, 1999) and Principles and Practices of Clinical Research (Academic Press, 2002, 4th edition (2018). Medical research Gallin's primary research interests are on the role of phagocytes, the body's scavenger cells in host defense. His research has focused on rare hereditary immune disorders, and he identified the genetic basis of several diseases of the phagocytes (neutrophils and macrophages). The laboratory has focused on neutrophil- specific granule deficiency, actin interacting protein deficiency and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). When phagocytes fail to produce hydrogen peroxide and bleach, CGD results. The laboratory described the genetic basis for several forms of CGD and the research has reduced life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections in CGD patients. The laboratory discovered that when CGD patients get older they are protected from atherosclerosis (narrowing of the arteries), suggesting the abnormal enzyme in this disease might be a drugable target for normal people with atherosclerosis. Achievements as NIH Clinical Center Director Dr. Gallin in 2011 During his tenure as director of the NIH Clinical Center, Gallin oversaw the design and construction of the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center (CRC), an 870,000-square-foot research hospital added to the original structure. The CRC opened to patients in 2005. Gallin also established a new curriculum for clinical research training that is now offered globally having reached over 35,000 students throughout the United States and in 26 countries and supported development of new information systems for sharing biomedical translational and clinical research. Gallin was key to establishing a Patient Advisory Group at the Clinical Center in 1998, one of the first for patients participating in clinical research. He, along with Clinical Center nurses, conceived and championed identifying resources from the NIH Foundation to construct the NIH Edmond J. Safra Family Lodge which opened in 2005. Gallin stressed the importance of collaboration and helped open the Clinical Center and its depth of resources to the research community outside NIH. Memberships Gallin is a member of the National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine) of the National Academy of Sciences, the Association of American Physicians, the American Society for Clinical Investigation, and the American College of Physicians (Master).

He is best known for having his ship stolen by William Kidd and Robert Culliford. History The ship Le Trompeuse (The Trickster) passed through several pirate and privateer hands in its career, including Laurens de Graaf, Pierre le Pain, and eventually Jean Hamlin. In 1681 Jean Fantin was aboard when Le Pain put Trompeuse into Jamaica. French language original, as reprinted in Le Diable Volant : Une histoire de la flibuste : de la mer des Antilles √† l'oc√©an Indien (1688-1700) / ('The Flying Devil : A History of the Filibusters : From the Antilles to the Indian Ocean (1688-1700)'). By 1684 he had switched ships, serving under Dutch buccaneer Jan ‚ÄúYankee‚Äù Willems. Alongside Jacob Evertson they were active off Panama, Venezuela, and Honduras in the intervening years, absorbing some of Jean Hamlin's former crew as well. Willems dropped Fantin and others off at Roatan in early 1688 and may have died shortly afterwards. Some of Willems‚Äô crew continued on to serve under George Peterson. Fantin and a few others were instead picked up from Roatan by Jean CharpinOne source (Vallar) says Fantin and Charpin were the same person; Gasser et al. do not agree. aboard the frigate Sainte Rose, a former Spanish ship which had also been part of de Graaf's flotilla. Also aboard were William Kidd and Robert Culliford, picked up at √éle-√†-Vache, two of the few Englishmen among an almost entirely French crew. There in early 1689 they captured a heavily laden Dutch ship under a privateering commission. Charpin sailed back to New England to sell off their cargo and resupply. The crew deposed Charpin from command and elected Fantin as captain. They sailed to the west coast of Africa, joining up with the ship Le Hasardeux of French buccaneer Jean-Baptiste du Casse at the Cape Verde Islands. Du Casse led them back toward the Caribbean; en route they caught a lone Spanish frigate which had sailed from Havana. Du Casse wanted its treasure but his privateering commission only allowed him to attack the Dutch. Fantin had no commission and so he took the Sainte Rose to capture the Spanish ship, transferring to it afterwards. Du Casse led a raid on the Dutch colony at Surinam but was repulsed with heavy losses. He attacked Berbice nearby but was stopped and departed with little gain. Some of du Casse's crew began to argue over division of the treasure from the Spanish frigate. England and France declared war in the meantime and so du Casse turned his attention to English colonies, attacking St. Christopher in the summer of 1689. Fantin, reinforced with fresh troops from Martinique, joined du Casse for the land assault. While he was ashore Kidd, Culliford, and the other Englishmen surprised and murdered the few French sailors left aboard and sailed off in the ship, which they took to Nevis and renamed the Blessed William. After the attack on St. Christopher the buccaneers went their separate ways, Fantin leaving with 70 men aboard a brigantine, while Charpin's former quartermaster Mathurin Desmarestz bought a ship of his own and sailed with many of the remaining French. Little is recorded of Fantin's later activities, though the fates of two of his ships are known. The Sainte Rose ended up beached during du Casse's expedition, and the ex-Spanish Blessed William ‚Äì stolen from Fantin by Kidd and Culliford ‚Äì was in turn stolen from Kidd by Culliford, who grew weary of privateering and land attacks with little reward and turned to outright piracy.

Developed and marketed by the Italian software house 3DFLOW, 3DF Zephyr was first released in January 2014 and continuously updated since then. It's a complete photogrammetry pipeline software package that includes many post processing tools for post processing, measurements, 3D modeling and content creation. It allows 3D reconstruction from both photos or videos, by automatically extracting frames and selecting those most suitable for the computation. Although the software is a Windows only application, it has been reported as fully working on Linux with the aid of Wine.  History  The technology behind 3DF Zephyr has been completely in-house built by 3DFLOW, rather than relying on computer vision third party libraries like most of its competitors. Initially released as 3DF Zephyr Pro, a consumer-targeted edition was released shortly, 3DF Zephyr Lite and then a GIS and mapping oriented edition as well, 3DF Zephyr Aerial. In 2017, 3DFLOW also released a free edition, which allows the processing of up to 50 images. Since 5.0 however, the Pro and Aerial edition were discontinued and merged into a new full version (called 3DF Zephyr), while maintaining 3DF Zephyr Lite and 3DF Zephyr Free as separate packages. The technology behind 3DF Zephyr is also academically traceable, as it can be found cited in more than 100 papers. 3DF Zephyr has been one of the first photogrammetry software tailored also for hobbyists and enthusiasts: it's the first photogrammetry software to be ever published on Steam and one of the few fully featured photogrammetry software packages available for free. All the 3DF Zephyr packages share the same proprietary reconstruction engine from 3DFLOW and bundle the automatic image masking software 3DF Masquerade, while the complete edition 3DF Zephyr bundles 3DF Scarlet which is a dedicated software for laser scan registration.

The remains of three prehistoric human fossils were discovered within the cave system. Along with Eve of Naharon, Naia, the Man of El Templo and the , the three fossils at Chan Hol are among several ancient Paleoamerican skeletons found in the submerged cave systems of the Yucat√°n Peninsula around Tulum, Quintana Roo. Description Chan Hol is derived from Mayan, meaning \\"little hole\\". The Chan Hol cave system extends over in length. The entrance, via the cenote, is located around away from Tulum and around from the modern coastline. As the sea level was over lower than it is today, the cave system was dry during the Late Pleistocene. During the Late Pleistocene, the Yucat√°n region was likely composed of dry savanna, grassland and even desert. Human fossils The skeletons of first two ancient Paleoamericans were discovered within the Chan Hol cave system. Both skeletons exhibit sinodont dental morphology. Chan Hol I The first fossil, Chan Hol I, was discovered in 2006 by Alexandra and Thorsten Kampe at a location in the cave system around northeast of the cenote entrance, at a depth of around underwater. Nicknamed El Joven, the fossil is dated to around 9194-8792 BP. The skeleton had fossilized while the cave system was still dry. The skeleton shows evidence of intentional placement of the dead body. Chan Hol II The second fossil, Chan Hol II, was discovered in 2009 by Harry Gust at a location in the cave system around southwest of the cenote entrance, at a depth of around underwater. In February 2012, photos of the skeleton spread on social media. In March 2012, the site was vandalized and looted. Most of the skeletal remains, including the skull, were stolen. In October 2012, researchers collected the leftover fossil fragments from the site. Although Chan Hol II was given the nickname La Ni√±a, later osteological analysis shows that the remains likely belonged to a young male. The fossil is dated to around 11,311 BP. The individual had died while the cave system was still dry. Chan Hol III The third fossil, Chan Hol III, was discovered in 2016 by divers Iv√°n Hern√°ndez and Vicente Fito led by Jer√≥nimo Avil√©s Olgu√≠n. The skeleton was discovered in a low cave tunnel in fresh water at 8 m water depth, at 1141 m diving distance from the cenote entrance. Nicknamed Ixchel after the Maya goddess of fertility. The fossil is a 30 years old woman lived around 10000 years ago. The skull shows evidence of various traumas and possibly signs of a disease that maybe driven her tribe to kill her. According to craniometric measurements, the skull is believed to conform to the mesocephalic pattern, like the other three skulls found in Tulum caves. Three different scars on the skull of the woman showed that she was hit with something hard and her skull bones were broken.Her skull also had crater-like deformations and tissue deformities that appeared to be caused by a bacterial relative of syphilis. According to study lead researcher Wolfgang Stinnesbeck, \\"It really looks as if this woman had a very hard time and an extremely unhappy end of her life. Obviously, this is speculative, but given the traumas and the pathological deformations on her skull, it appears a likely scenario that she may have been expelled from her group and was killed in the cave, or was left in the cave to die there‚Äù. The newly discovered skeleton was 140 meters away from the Chan Hol 2 site. Although archaeologists assumed the divers found the remains of the missing Chan Hol 2, the analysis proved that these assumptions were erroneous in a short time. Stinnesbeck compared the new bones to old photographs of Chan Hol 2 and showed that the two skeletons represent different individuals. Due to their distinctive features, study co-researcher Samuel Rennie suggest the existence of at least two morphologically diverse groups of people living separately in Mexico during the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene.

Studies had shown that gay men earn less than their heterosexual counterparts, whereas lesbians tended to earn more. A recent study suggests that this may be changing, as gay men earned more than their heterosexual counterparts in the US. People who are openly lesbian, gay, bisexual, and/or transgender may be more likely to experience socioeconomic disadvantages.  Phenomenon  A study by Georgia State University from 2009 stated, that queer men earn 8‚Äì10% less in government compared to heteronormative men, even when taking education, race, years of experience and occupation into account. Until recently, there was no openly gay CEO on the Fortune 1000 list, as the Wall Street Journal investigated in 2012. Kirk Snyder, professor at the USC business-school, noted that gay people are better entrepreneurs. Gay managers have a 25% higher level of employee engagement. The National Transgender Discrimination Survey reported, that trans people are up to four times as likely to earn less than $10,000 and twice as likely to be unemployed due to discrimination. In the 2013‚Äì2015 National Health Surveys analysed by Christopher Carpenter and Samuel Eppink, they found that gay, full-time employed men made, on average, 10% more than similarly employed straight men even when controlling for various other factors.  Wage discrimination by country   Germany  Taking into account age, education, and industry, gay men earn less than heterosexuals even though they tend to be better educated than the average population.  Australia  An Australian study has shown that gay men earn 13% less than their straight counterparts. Meanwhile, lesbians earn 13% more than straight women. La Nauze, economist at University of Melbourne, noted: \\"There are grounds for concern that workers in Australia, particularly gay men, are discriminated against because of their sexual orientation.\\"  United States  A study of the 2013‚Äì15 National Health Interview Surveys found that gay, full-time employed men made, on average, 10% more than similarly employed straight men. The same study showed that lesbians received a pay premium of 9%. Bisexual men and women earned less than both gay and straight counterparts.  Wage discrimination by orientation   Lesbian women  Lesbian and bisexual women receive the same pay or the equivalent of what a straight woman makes. The general dynamic‚Äîthat gay men suffer a pay gap while lesbians receive a pay premium‚Äîcan be explained by the gender bias in pay. Men earn more than women in most occupations, and this inequality plays out regardless of sexual orientation. In fact, in Badgett's 2009 review, some studies showed that while lesbians earned more than heterosexual women, they made less than straight and gay men. \\"In the case of lesbian women, they are compared to heterosexual women, who are really the lowest paid people,\\" says Badgett. Meanwhile, the earnings of gay men were compared to straight men, who are, on average, paid the most. Lesbian women make a median of 1.4% more than heterosexual women, but make 25.6% less than heterosexual men. Women who are between the ages of 18 and 44, 29% of bisexual women and 23% of lesbian women are experiencing poverty, unlike the 21% of heterosexual women who are not. Lesbian couples tend to experience higher poverty rates while earning similarly the same as straight women. This is largely due to the discrimination and homophobia that homosexual women face that their heterosexual counterparts do not. But, lesbians still earn less than the regular household income of a heterosexual couple because of the gender wage gap. As a result, lesbian couples/households are more likely to live in poverty than heterosexual couples/households. Thus, gay women are economically disadvantaged for not being the straight stereotypical female in a heterosexual relationship. Even when lesbians do get hired they are far more likely to face workplace harassment and bullying. In America, a study from UCLA's Williams Institute found up to 41 percent of LGBT+ employees had been \\"verbally or physically abused or had their workplace vandalized.\\" While 1 in 6 had reported that their sexual orientation stood in the way of career advancement, or lead to them being let go.  Gay men  Until recently it was thought that gay men made a median of 18.4% less than compared to straight men. A recent study has showed that in the US Gay men now earn 10% more than their heterosexual counterparts. Gay men are economically disadvantaged for not being the straight stereotypical male in a heterosexual relationship. Gay and bisexual men receive 10‚Äì32% less pay than straight men, especially when considering factors such as education, race, occupation, and work experience come into the work place. 20% of gay men and 25% of bisexual men between the ages of 18 and 44 live in or below the poverty level, unlike the 15% of heterosexual men who are not.  Transgender individuals  Transgender adults are nearly 4 times as likely to have a household income of under $10,000 per year.

The film is a modern retelling of the 1897 play Cyrano de Bergerac by Edmond Rostand, and stars Shannon Purser, Kristine Froseth, RJ Cyler, and Noah Centineo. The film was released on September 7, 2018, by Netflix. Plot Sierra (Shannon Purser) is smart and aspirational, and she strives to get admitted into Stanford University. But she is unpopular, and many of her fellow students say that she is unattractive. Sierra is targeted by the criticism‚Äîwhich she answers with wit‚Äîand insults‚Äîwhich she sidesteps with charm‚Äîof her popular classmate Veronica (Kristine Froseth). Jamey is a handsome football player from another high school; he doesn't know that Veronica has a \\"boyfriend\\" attending college, and so Jamey asks for her phone number. Veronica wants to dodge Jamey's attention, and she also assumes that if Sierra found herself at the center of the handsome young man's attention, then Sierra would become self- conscious and feel ashamed. Thus, Veronica responds to Jamey's request by giving him Sierra's phone number, while misrepresenting it as being her own. Jamey intends to write a text to Veronica, but instead it is received by Sierra. They exchange messages and they flirt. Although Sierra does understand that Jamey mistakenly believes he's communicating with some person other than herself, she develops a crush on the football player. In band class, Sierra tells her best friend Dan (RJ Cyler) that she has \\"met a guy\\" and she explains how it happened. Dan disapproves of Sierra for having concealed the facts from Jamey; he says, \\"It's called catfishing, and I'm pretty sure it's illegal.\\" Sierra defends herself by saying that Jamey's decisions to engage with her have been based solely on his interactions with her, alone. Sierra approaches Veronica, who is upset after being dumped by her college boyfriend, Spence, because he considers Veronica to be too dumb. She offers to tutor Veronica, in exchange for help in continuing to talk to Jamey. Veronica agrees, and they begin tutoring. As they continue helping each other, Sierra learns more about Veronica's frustrating family life, and Veronica develops appreciation for Sierra. Veronica reveals how her father abandoned her mother for a 22-year-old and how it has changed both her and her mother's lives. Veronica also has to deal with her overbearing mother who pushed her into cheerleading and popularity. One night, Jamey video calls Veronica, who appears on the camera screen while Sierra talks behind it. The video call soon ends when Jamey tells her there is lag, and as soon as they hang up, Sierra and Veronica gleefully laugh together over the fact that it worked. Although initially cold to one another, Veronica and Sierra end up being friends. When Jamey asks Sierra, whom he believes to be Veronica, out on a date, Veronica goes with him as a favor to Sierra. However, when he tries to kiss Veronica, Veronica tells him to close his eyes and Sierra kisses him instead, and Jamey believes that he kissed Veronica. Sierra told her parents I can't live up to your expectations, I need to be my own person. Before a football game, Jamey kisses Veronica. Veronica is angry at Jamey for doing this, because she feels like she is betraying Sierra. Jamey does not understand why she is angry, because he believes that she was the person he had kissed on their date. Sierra witnesses the kiss and assumes that Veronica kissed Jamey on purpose. As revenge, she decides to reveal that Veronica was dumped by her ex-boyfriend. During the football game, Veronica angrily tells Jamey the truth, and when a panicked Sierra attempts to defend herself and explain, he recognizes her voice. Shocked, he tells both Sierra and Veronica to stay away from him and he leaves. Sierra writes a song called \\"Sunflower\\" and sends it to Veronica as an apology.Veronica told her mother off and stood up to her. That she needs to be her own person. Veronica shows up at Jamey's house to make him listen to the song and tells him that Sierra is a great girl. Jamey decides to forgive Sierra and take her to homecoming, bringing her a sunflower. Jamey expresses his feelings for Sierra and admits that she is exactly his type. They kiss again and go to homecoming together. At the dance, Veronica and Sierra see each other. Without a word, they reconcile by sharing an embrace, and are joined by Dan.

Release The film was released on September 7, 2018, on Netflix. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 61% based on 38 reviews, with an average rating of 5.68/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Sierra Burgess Is a Loser, but her movie's okay - largely thanks to Shannon Purser's work in the title role, which is strong enough to counter an uneven narrative.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 60 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" The film has been criticized by some for romanticizing certain character choices by the female protagonist, Sierra Burgess, specifically her catfishing and sharing a non-consensual kiss with her love interest, hacking, cyber bullying and mistreating her friend, and pretending to be deaf with support from one of her friends.

History The journal was founded by Marcel Fournier, a professor of law and moderate liberal, with the help of partners such as Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau. The first issue appeared in July 1894. The stated objective was to become \\"a safe and prudent guide for the elected representatives of universal suffrage and the cadres of democracy\\". Fournier wanted to discuss questions debated in parliament in more depth, and disseminate the views of specialists to the politicians. The journal was published in Paris and appeared monthly. Although the main focus was on parliamentary, legislative, and political matters, it also discussed economic and social questions. It gave a summary of political and parliamentary life in countries other than France. In 1897 Fournier was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour. The former deputy and future senator Fernand Faure became director of the journal from 1901. He held this position until 1911. In the early 1900s the journal published the competing views of Ferdinand Buisson, Charles Dupuy and Ren√© Goblet on the role of the church in education. In 1910 Faure published articles in the journal on counting civil servants in France and the other main European countries. In 1924 Paul Gueriot wrote in the journal on the two main positions in the debate over labour and immigration, a pressing issue given the labour shortage following World War I. The one group held that workers were a form of \\"human capital\\", and could be imported as needed, while the other held that humans were more than mere animals, and \\"the foreigner brings us a mentality different from our own, which cannot be fused with ours.\\" From 1932 the supplement Le Bilan √©conomique et financier de la France et de l'√©tranger (Economic and Financial Review of France and Abroad) was included in the journal. Georges Putot (1900‚Äì89), a political economist who taught at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences from 1927 and became president of that school in 1965, edited the journal from 1957 to 1961. In 1980 Guy Planadevall was director and Mario Guastoni was editor-in-chief. The journal appeared bimonthly from July/August 1985, and then quarterly starting in 2004. The journal, like others, has tended to focus on presidential and legislative elections, and has paid less attention to local elections. However, it did publish a special issue on the local elections of 2010. Contributors Over the years contributors have included Charles de Gaulle, who gave his ideas on a professional mechanized army in the 1930s, Raymond Poincar√©, Paul Doumer, Vincent Auriol, Edgar Faure, Pierre Mend√®s France, Raymond Aron, Georges Pompidou, Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing, Fran√ßois Mitterrand, Jacques Chirac, Lionel Jospin and Fran√ßois Hollande.

Located on a campus just outside of the suburb of Reynoldsburg, the hospital serves the east side of Columbus as well as other smaller communities. Mount Carmel East is part of Mount Carmel Health System, which was founded in 1886 by the Sisters of the Holy Cross. It is located off Interstate 270 and is accessible from the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA) public transport network. The hospital opened in 1972, and has expanded since, becoming the largest hospital in the Mount Carmel Health System network and the fourth-largest hospital in Central Ohio. U.S. News & World Report regionally ranked Mount Carmel East and West Hospitals as the 18th best performing hospitals in Ohio and high performing in four specialties and procedures. Mount Carmel East offers many treatments from specialists and services within its grounds. In 2003, a new four-story tower opened, dedicated to expanding both the heart diagnostic, surgical and treatment capacity along with a new maternity unit. In 2015, the hospital began a large expansion to accommodate the needs of the growing population on the east side of Columbus. This expansion consists of an entire reconstruction of the original structure. A new five-story patient tower and several additions to the hospital had the specific focus of expanding the capacity services offered on-site. This expansion is being driven to meet the needs of the growing population in the area. This project is not scheduled to be completed until 2019. History 100px The land that would eventually become Mount Carmel East was purchased in 1908, and originally supported a farm that grew food for what is now Mount Carmel West. The five-year construction of the original hospital was completed in 1972, opening as a 233-bed facility. In 1984, Mount Carmel Health System was created, incorporating all Mount Carmel Hospitals and associated organizations under a new health care organization. In 1999 Mount Carmel East Hospital was renamed Mount Carmel East. In 2000, Mount Carmel joined Trinity Health, the third largest Catholic healthcare system in the United States. In 2015, Mount Carmel Health System had an operating income of $61.9 million on $1.70 billion in revenue, ranking Mount Carmel the second-largest system in the Trinity Health group. In 2003, construction was finished on a four-story, , $66 million tower designed to expand the cardiac and maternity care at the hospital. The expanded maternity unit is designed to handle 3,500 deliveries a year. The expansion of the heart center included two operating rooms and many cardiology upgrades allowing it to function as a fully functioning emergency cardiac treatment center. Following this, in July 2003, an $18 million project to expand the emergency room was completed. In 2015, a plan was announced to begin construction on a new five-story patient tower, reducing the number of beds from the current 419 to 381 all-private patient rooms. This includes thorough reconstruction of the original structure to better accommodate the needs of the population on the east side of Columbus as it has become the largest hospital on the east side of Columbus. In addition, there will be a new surgical suite with 12 operating rooms and 40 prep and recovery rooms. The main entrance and emergency room are planned to be heavily reconstructed as well, making each easier to access from outside along with an all new easier to navigate interior. This modernization of the entire hospital and construction of additional facilities is planned to be completed by the end of 2019. Services In 2003, Mount Carmel East opened a new four-story, $66 million tower with a focus on cardiac and maternity care. Since this was completed, Mount Carmel East has two open-heart operating rooms, a stent- capable catheterization laboratory, a cardiovascular neuro-services center, an eight-bed post-surgery intensive care unit, an 18-bed and a 30-bed step-down unit all within its hospital grounds. A dedicated electrophysiology (EP) lab was opened in November 2003. In 2005, Mount Carmel won the Catholic Health Association's Achievement Citation, and it was awarded the Thomson Reuters Top 50 Cardiovascular Hospitals award for heart care in 2010. Mount Carmel East has been accredited as an Advanced Comprehensive Stroke Center from the American Heart Association & American Stroke Association and received the Gold Seal of Approval from the Joint Commission. A significant focus on maternity care has been a mission of this hospital since its founding. Mount Carmel East is equipped with a Level III neonatal intensive care unit and a Maternal-Fetal Medicine (MFM) program known as the Little Miracles program. In 2012, there were 2,347 births and 783 caesarean sections at this hospital. Free tours of the facilities are offered for expecting families during pregnancy. The Bruce E. Siegel Center for Health Education was finished in 1993 and officially opened in January 1994. The facility was named after Bruce E. Siegel MD, one of the first members of the medical staff at Mount Carmel East. The center is used for community outreach and health education such as diabetes care, maternity programs and heart health seminars. Mount Carmel East also has chaplains that are available to all patients and family members. Catholic Mass is offered in the chapel located in the Bruce E. Siegel Center on Sundays. The chapel in the hospital is open 24 hours a day. In 2016, Mount Carmel East received a \\"B\\" Hospital Safety ScoreSM from the Leapfrog Group, an independent nonprofit run by employers and other large purchasers of health benefits, whose stated goal is to save \\"lives by reducing errors, injuries, accidents and infections.‚Äù In the fall of 2017 the Leapfrog Group again rated Mount Carmel East a \\"B\\".

It is able to provide a wide variety menu and on-demand room service to meet patients' needs. Mount Carmel Health System uses onsite security officers equipped with collapsible batons and pepper spray but who do not carry firearms. Mount Carmel Health System uses hand-held wands throughout Mount Carmel East for weapon detecting. Security officers are placed throughout the grounds and patrol all parking facilities. In emergency departments, these procedures are used on anyone who wishes to see someone who is a victim of domestic violence or gang activity. Mount Carmel has claimed the number of ‚Äúdisturbances‚Äù at its hospitals declined 27 per-cent between 2009 and 2011. Expansion New patient tower under construction Mount Carmel East witnessed large-scale expansion alongside other major facilities in the Mount Carmel Health network, with construction beginning in May 2015 and to be completed by the end of 2019. Many of the hospital's service areas were earmarked for this expansion, the most notable being a new six-story tower with one story below ground, the conversion of the existing 419 beds to 381 all-private patient rooms as well as a thorough reconstruction of the original structure. Mount Carmel worked with the neighboring community during the planning and construction including community outreach receiving mostly noise and construction-related complaints which culminated in a landscape plan around the hospital. A new two-story parking garage with 439 spaces is constructed on an existing parking area in front of the Heart center bringing the total parking on site to around 2000. Several ancillary additions were also planned such as a new materials-handling wing, an expansion of the chiller building and boiler plant. By mid-2017, Mount Carmel East had announced plans to build a new $26 million, 80-bed, behavioral-health hospital near the Mount Carmel East campus, to be opened by fall 2018. Inpatient behavioral-health beds at Mount Carmel West hospital would be moved there upon closure of West's behavioral-health facility. The location of the new behavioral-health facility is on the east side of Columbus, south of Interstate 70 and about from Mount Carmel East hospital.  Mount Carmel Medical Group Mount Carmel East is part of Mount Carmel Medical Group, representing more than 250 primary care and specialty care providers. This is a network of providers for care that is not of an emergency nature. The hospital is also affiliated with Mount Carmel Health Partners ‚Äì a network of up to \\"1,200 primary care and specialty physicians\\" ‚Äì and with Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield. This expanded the network of care providers in the central Ohio area that were associated with Mount Carmel, although unlike the situation with providers in the Mount Carmel Health System, items such as medical records may not be transferred automatically. Transport North parking garage The hospital is accessible by public transport via COTA bus services operating throughout metropolitan Columbus, Ohio. Mount Carmel East is also accessible from Interstate 270 immediately off exit 39 onto Ohio State Route 16. They are also affiliated with Angel MedFlight allowing fixed wing aircraft to land at nearby John Glenn Columbus International Airport and provide patients with specialized treatment at Mount Carmel East from a wide geographic area. Parking is available for free at a new parking garage and three parking lots nearby on the hospital grounds. Breakthroughs Surgeons at Mount Carmel East helped develop the SpineMask technique for a new type of spinal surgery. SpineMask creates a map of the patient's spine using LED lights. Once this map is created, surgeons are able to see with more precision than presently available where their surgical instruments are in relation to the patient. This allows surgeons to more accurately perform spinal fusions while using a less invasive procedure for the patient.

Among these state treasures were 30 of the 40 Faberg√© eggs that had been held by the Moscow Armory following the abdication of the last Russian tsar, Nicholas II. The new government of Russia began its existence in dire financial straights. Lenin and later Stalin needed money as quickly as possible, and the liquidation of Russian art works was believed to be one way to accomplish this. Antikvariat's members were not curators or art specialists but members of the Communist Party selected by other Party members to extract as much money as possible from the sale of Russian art to Western businessmen and diplomats. Russian art historians in charge of holding these works thwarted their attempts, and sometimes disguised or hid works that Antikvariat, had it known of their existence, would have preferred to have sold. For this, many of those passionate to retain these works were arrested, tried, and executed.

Asef Bayat and Olivier Roy are among the main architects of the idea.  Terminology and definition  The term was coined by Iranian political sociologist Asef Bayat, then associate professor of sociology at The American University in Cairo in a 1996 essay published in the journal Middle East Critique. Bayat explained it as \\"a condition where, following a phase of experimentation, the appeal, energy, symbols and sources of legitimacy of Islamism get exhausted, even among its once-ardent supporters. As such, post-Islamism is not anti-Islamic, but rather reflects a tendency to resecularize religion.\\" It originally pertained only to Iran, where \\"post-Islamism is expressed in the idea of fusion between Islam (as a personalized faith) and individual freedom and choice; and post-Islamism is associated with the values of democracy and aspects of modernity\\". In this context, the prefix post- does not have historic connotation, but refers to the critical departure from Islamist discourse. Bayat later pointed in 2007 that post-Islamism is both a \\"condition\\" and a \\"project\\". \\"Postmodern Islamism\\" and \\"New Age Islamism\\" are other terms interchangeably used. French politician Olivier Carr√© used the term in 1991 from a different perspective, to describe the period between the 10th and the 19th centuries, when both Shiite and Sunni Islam \\"separated the political-military from the religious realm, both theoretically and in practice\\".  Cases  In Iran, the Reformists and the group known as the Melli-Mazhabi (who are ideologically close to the Freedom Movement) are described as post-Islamists. The advent of moderate parties Al-Wasat Party in Egypt, as well as Justice and Development Party in Morocco appeared to resemble emergence of post-Islamism, however scholars rejected that they qualify as such. A similar characterization applies to the Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS). A 2008 Lowy Institute for International Policy paper suggests that Prosperous Justice Party of Indonesia and Justice and Development Party (AKP) of Turkey are post-Islamist. According to Ahmet T. Kuru and Alfred Stepan (2012), many analysts consider Turkish AKP an example of post-Islamism, similar to Christian democratic parties, but Islamic. However, some scholars such as Bassam Tibi dispute this. ƒ∞hsan Yƒ±lmaz argues that the party's ideology after 2011 is different from that of between 2001 and 2011. The idea has been used to describe the \\"ideological evolution\\" within the Ennahda of Tunisia.

Bosworth, Mussolini‚Äôs Italy: Life Under the Fascist Dictatorship 1915-1945, New York, NY, Penguin Press, 2006, p.172 In the accord, Mussolini clearly voiced his opposition and contempt for the provincial paramilitary squads and their landowning allies, declaring that they were ‚Äúthe dullest, deafest, most miserable cast that exists in Italy‚Äù.Dahlia S. Elazar, The Making of Fascism: Class, State, and Counter- Revolution, Italy 1919-1922, Westport, CT, Praeger, 2001, p. 141 The agreement was short-lived since many of the action squads leaders denounced the pacification pact with the socialists, along with Mussolini‚Äôs leadership, arguing that the Duce ‚Äúhad not created the movement‚Äù and that they could ‚Äúget along without him.‚ÄùStanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism, 1914-1945, University of Wisconsin Press, 1995, p. 100 History The violence between the action squads (squadristi) and socialists and communist activists continued to escalate from 1919 to 1921. Revolutionary socialists were engaged in political assassinations, strikes, physical possession of factories, seizures of private land, and riots who often ‚Äúcoerced smallholders‚Äù(farmer owners) ‚Äúas well as laborers into Socialist unions,‚Äù causing rural landowners to launch retaliatory assaults against socialist targets.Stanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism, 1914-1945, University of Wisconsin Press, 1995, p. 95 Across the Italian landscape ‚Äútrains and barracks, banks and public buildings were attacked by mobs,‚Äù while many areas were draped in red banners and were declared to have ‚Äúpassed wholly into the hands of the Communists.‚ÄùChristopher Hibbert, Mussolini: The Rise and Fall of Il Duce, New York: NY, St. Martin‚Äôs Press, 2008, p. 28. First published in 1962 as Il Duce: The Life of Benito Mussolini The rural paramilitary leaders took the position that ‚Äúviolence could only be met by greater violence‚Äù in a situation that was almost comparable to a civil war.Christopher Hibbert, Mussolini: The Rise and Fall of Il Duce, New York: NY, St. Martin‚Äôs Press, 2008, pp. 28-29 Mussolini found himself under increasing pressure to reduce the anti-socialist violence, finding it difficult to be put in a position to take a ‚Äúcategorically antileftist position,‚Äù since he had raised the possibility of forming a sort of ‚Äúnationalist-leftist coalition government.‚Äù Stanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism, 1914-1945, University of Wisconsin Press, 1995, p. 100 By 1921, the fasci movement had expanded to the point where almost every political position in Italy was represented, which was encouraged by Mussolini‚Äôs denials that he had ‚Äúany propramme‚Äù whatsoever, pointing out that fascism would ‚Äúappeal simultaneously to ‚Äòaristocrats and democrats, revolutionaries and reactionaries, proletarians and anti-proletarians, pacifists and anti- pacifists.‚Äô‚ÄùDenis Mack Smith, Mussolini, New York, NY, Vintage Books, 1983, p. 45 Willing to court almost any populist movement, Mussolini found it politically advantageous at first to identify with the nationalistic movement of independent and loosely organized anti-socialist militias, although at the time he ‚Äúdid not want to lose his position on the left,‚Äù since he was considering the possibility of a ‚ÄúFascist Labor Party‚Äù or ‚ÄúNational Labor Party.‚ÄùStanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism, 1914-1945, University of Wisconsin Press, 1995, p. 99 Mussolini envisioned a ‚Äúcoalition of labor syndicalists,‚Äù but the increasing violence between socialist and anti- socialist squads was harming his chances to amass a wider political constituency. Caught in the middle During the 1919 elections, the Fascists had attempted to court the socialist-left while publicly dubbing himself the ‚ÄúLenin of Italy‚Äù,Denis Mack Smith, Modern Italy: A Political History, University of Michigan Press, 1997, p. 284, first published in 1959 attempting to ‚Äúout-socialist the socialists‚Äù,Denis Mack Smith, Modern Italy: A Political History, University of Michigan Press, 1997, p. 297 which resulted in an election where the socialists garnished ‚Äúforty times as many votes.‚ÄùDenis Mack Smith, Mussolini, New York, NY, Vintage Books, 1983, p. 38 This devastating and humiliating election defeat pushed Mussolini towards finding other populist movements that could catapult him into a powerful seat of authority, even though he ‚Äúbriefly reconsidered emigrating‚Äù in the belief that his movement was finished.Denis Mack Smith, Mussolini, New York, NY, Vintage Books, 1983, p. 39 The poor state of affairs of the fasci movement was reported by Fascists themselves at their Third Fascist Congress, who calculated that they had ‚Äúonly 100 fasci and 30,000 supporters‚Äù in 1920, as compared to ‚Äú2,200 fasci and 320,000 members by late 1921. Charles F. Delzell, edit., Mediterranean Fascism 1919-1945, New York, NY, Walker and Company, 1971, p. 26 In an attempt to expand his minuscule party, Mussolini seemed to have employed the political strategy of entryism in which a smaller political movement aspires to capture a larger one under a degree of subterfuge and subversion. In a sense, as historian Stanley G. Payne explained, the ‚Äúnew mass Fascism‚Äù of the agrarian squadrists ‚Äúhad not been created by Mussolini,‚Äù but had instead ‚Äúsprung up around him.‚ÄùStanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism, 1914-1945, University of Wisconsin Press, 1995, p. 98 As Mussolini proceeded to ensnare the mostly self-organizing militias under his fascist banner, his movement began to experience a fast-expanding ‚Äúinflux of middle-class people‚Äù who were relatively conservative.Stanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism, 1914-1945, University of Wisconsin Press, 1995, p. 99 Generally, the ras leaders supported nationalism, not socialism, and were upset over the socialists and communist involvement in political violence against landowners and the middle class. This put Mussolini, the former leader of the Italian Socialist Party (1912-1914) and a former Marxist who had supported Lenin‚Äôs October Revolution in 1917,Peter Neville, Mussolini, Oxon, England, UK; New York: NY, Routledge, 2004, p. 36 into an almost impossible position to achieve consensus among his diverse followers. Reaction to the peace pact After the peace pact was announced, many of the leading ras opposed it, including Dino Grandi, Italo Balbo, Roberto Farinacci, and Piero Marsich, who refused to recognize the pact, creating a serious split.Charles F. Delzell, edit., Mediterranean Fascism 1919-1945, New York, NY, Walker and Company, 1971, p. 26 In the city of Bologna, posters appeared that accused ‚ÄúMussolini as a traitor to Fascism.‚ÄùDahlia S. Elazar, The Making of Fascism: Class, State, and Counter-Revolution, Italy 1919-1922, Westport, CT, Praeger, 2001, p. 142 In many Italian cities, including Florence, the local fasci decided to dissolve their local chapter to ‚Äúprotest against the Pact and Mussolini‚Äôs leadership.‚Äù There were at least two secret anti-Mussolini meetings where a cloud of resentment focused on ‚ÄúMussolini‚Äôs lingering leftist loyalties.‚ÄùStanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism, 1914-1945, University of Wisconsin Press, 1995, pp. 100-101 Many leading ras agitated for a leadership change, suggesting that someone else such as Gabriele D‚ÄôAnnunzio should ‚Äúreplace Mussolini.‚ÄùEdward Townley, Mussolini and Italy, series editor, Martin Collier, Oxford: UK, Heinemann Educational Publishers, 2002, p. 31 Grandi and Balbo sought out D‚ÄôAnnunzio in August 1921, and encouraged him to lead the movement in an ‚Äúinsurrectionary march on Rome.‚ÄùDavid D. Roberts, The Syndicalist Tradition and Italian Fascism, University of North Carolina Press, 1979, p. 215 This proposed leadership change appealed to younger fascists who supported ‚Äúneosyndicalist principles‚Äù found in syndicalist Alceste De Ambris‚Äôs Carta del Carnaro (Charter of Carnaro), a constitution written for the seized city of Fiume that combined ‚Äúmodern syndicalism‚Äù with a ‚Äúsociety of producers.‚ÄùDavid D.

Bosworth, Mussolini‚Äôs Italy: Life Under the Fascist Dictatorship 1915-1945, New York, NY, Penguin Press, 2006, p.174 Agrarian Fascism As the representative of ‚Äúurban fascism‚Äù, Mussolini feared the rise of ‚Äúagrarian fascism‚Äù that had originated from the rural squadristi, regarding them as ‚Äúrival contenders for the leadership of his movement,‚Äù whose violence might precipitate a general defeat by policing and military agencies.Denis Mack Smith, Mussolini, New York, NY, Vintage Books, 1983, p. 45 To remedy the situation, Mussolini challenged the squadristi head-on by signing the peace accord with the socialists in order to put an end to punitive raids and constrain the seemingly uncontrollable squadristi.Denis Mack Smith, Mussolini, New York, NY, Vintage Books, 1983, p. 45 Considering fascism to be his child, Mussolini wrote that agrarian fascism represented ‚Äúthe private interests of the most sinister and contemptible classes in Italy.‚Äù Dahlia S. Elazar, The Making of Fascism: Class, State, and Counter-Revolution, Italy 1919-1922, Westport, CT, Praeger, 2001, p. 93 He soon came to the realization that he had overplayed his hand in his attacks against the agrarian fascists, and finding himself in the minority, he resigned his position as the leader of fascism. If fascism was going to represent nothing but reactionary opposition, Mussolini ‚Äúclaimed to be prepared to wash his hands of it.‚ÄùDavid D. Roberts, The Syndicalist Tradition and Italian Fascism, University of North Carolina Press, 1979, p. 216 Mussolini‚Äôs resignation Although Mussolini resigned as a member of the executive group of the Central Committee on August 18, 1921, his dramatic gesture failed to accomplish his plan. Instead of falling into line, the agrarian ras remained united in their repudiation of the Pact.Dahlia S. Elazar, The Making of Fascism: Class, State, and Counter-Revolution, Italy 1919-1922, Westport, CT, Praeger, 2001, p. 142 Mussolini claimed that he would support the peace pact with all his strength, declaring that ‚ÄúIf Fascism does not follow me in collaboration with the Socialists, at least no one can force me to follow Fascism.‚ÄùChristopher Hibbert, Mussolini: The Rise and Fall of Il Duce, New York: NY, St. Martin‚Äôs Press, 2008, p. 31 Within days, another Fascist leader resigned, Cesare Rossi, their deputy-secretary.

Socio-economic context  Cambodia is pursuing its transformation from a post-conflict state into a market economy. Growth averaged 6.4% per year between 2007 and 2012 and the poverty rate shrank from 48% to 19% of the population, according to the Asian Development Bank's Country Partnership Strategy 2014‚Äì2018. Cambodia exports mainly garments and products from agriculture and fisheries but is striving to diversify the economy. There is some evidence of expansion in value-added exports from a low starting point, largely thanks to the manufacture of electrical goods and telecommunications by foreign multinationals implanted in the country. Between 2008 and 2013, high-tech exports climbed from just US$3.8million to US$76.5 million. In 2014, the country adopted its Cambodia Vision 2030, which aims to turn Cambodia into an upper-middle economy by 2030. In 2015, it adopted its Industrial Development Policy 2015‚Äì2025. Cambodia is a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which formed a common market in late 2015 called the ASEAN Economic Community. The planned removal of restrictions on the cross-border movement of people and services is expected to spur cooperation in science and technology. The greater mobility of skilled personnel should be a boon for the region and enhance the role of the ASEAN University Network, which counted 30 members in 2016, including the Royal University of Phnom Penh.  Science and technology policy   National strategies for science and technology  International and civil wars decimated Cambodia's scientific capacity in the 1970s. More recently, Cambodia has been held back by the limited co-ordination of science and technology across ministries and the absence of any overarching national strategy for science and development. A National Committee for Science and Technology representing 11 ministries has been in place since 1999. Although seven ministries are responsible for the country's 33 public universities, the majority of these institutions come under the umbrella of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Support. In 2010, the Ministry of Education, Youth and Support approved a Policy on Research Development in the Education Sector. This move represented a first step towards a national approach to research and development across the university sector and the application of research for the purposes of national development. This policy was followed by the country's first National Science and Technology Master Plan 2014‚Äì2020. It was officially launched by the Ministry of Planning in December 2014, as the culmination of a two-year process supported by the Korea International Cooperation Agency. The plan makes provision for establishing a science and technology foundation to promote industrial innovation, with a particular focus on agriculture, primary industry and ICTs.  Rectangular Development Strategy  Another indication that Cambodia is taking a more co-ordinated approach to science and technology policy and its integration into the country's wider development plans is Phase III of the government's Rectangular Development Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity and Efficiency: Phase III, which became operational in 2014. This third stage of the strategy is intended to serve as a policy instrument for attaining the objectives of Cambodia Vision 2030 and the country's Industrial Development Policy 2015‚Äì2025. The latter were both foreshadowed in the Rectangular Development Strategy of 2013, which is significant for having identified specific roles for science. The Industrial Development Policy 2014‚Äì2025 was launched in March 2015 and complemented related medium-term strategies, such as the National Sustainable Development Strategy for Cambodia, published in 2009 with support from the United Nations Environment Programme and Asian Development Bank, and the Climate Change Strategic Plan 2014‚Äì2023, published with support from European international development agencies. The Rectangular Development Strategy sets out four strategic objectives: agriculture; physical infrastructure; private sector development; and human capacity-building. Each of these objectives is accompanied by four priority areas for action. A role for science and technology has been defined in one or more of the priority areas for each ‚Äòrectangle‚Äô. Although science and technology are clearly identified as a cross-cutting strategy for promoting innovation for development, it will be important to co-ordinate and monitor the implementation of priority activities and assess the outcome. The key challenge here will be to build a sufficient human resource base in science and engineering to support the ‚Äòrectangular‚Äô targets.  Support for industrial innovation  The large foreign firms in Cambodia that are the main source of value-added exports tend to specialize in electrical machinery and t√©l√©communications. The principal task for science and technology policy will be to facilitate spillovers from these large operators towards smaller firms and across other sectors like agriculture, in order to strengthen the technical capacity of these smaller firms. There is little evidence that the Law on Patents, Utility Model Certificates and Industrial Designs (2006) has been of practical use, thus far, to any but the larger foreign firms operating in Cambodia. By 2012, 27 patent applications had been filed, all by foreigners. Of the 42 applications for industrial design received up to 2012, 40 had been filed by foreigners. Nevertheless, the law has no doubt encouraged foreign firms to introduce technological improvements to their on-shore production systems, which can only be beneficial.  Trends in human resource development  Public expenditure on education accounted for 2.6% of GDP (2010), compared to 1.6% in 2007. The share going to tertiary education remains modest, at 0.38% of GDP or 15% of total expenditure, but it is growing. Despite this, Cambodia still ranks lowest in the region for the education dimension of the World Bank's Knowledge Economy Index. In 2011, 1.5% of the Cambodian population was enrolled in tertiary education, one of the lowest ratios in Southeast Asia, ahead of Myanmar (1.2% of the population). Only one out of 12 bachelor's students went on to enrol in a master's/PhD programme. One-quarter of university graduates (27.5%) were women in 2008.  Research trends   Researchers  There were 471.3 researchers (in full-time equivalents) in 2015, double the number in 2002 (223).This corresponds to 30.3 per million inhabitants in 2015, almost double the ratio in 2002 (17.6 per million inhabitants). When measured in head counts, one in five researchers (21%) was a woman in 2009.[1] More than half of research (51%) was performed by the non-profit sector in 2009. Government employees performed another quarter (25%), company employees and academics a further 12% each (12%). The country's narrow economic and scientific base offers some opportunity for growth tied to food production. However, the diffused responsibility for science and technology across 11 key ministries presents challenges for effective policy development and governance. Although there is evidence of growing collaboration across some key agricultural institutions, such as the Cambodian Agricultural Research and Development Institute and the Royal University of Agriculture, difficulties persist in extending this type of collaboration to a broader range of institutions.  Expenditure  According to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, Cambodia spent 0.12% of GDP on research and development (R&D;) in 2015.[2] As in many of the world's least developed economies, there is a strong reliance on international aid and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). In 2002, about 28% of research funding came from abroad and as much as 43% from the private non-profit sector. The regulatory environment for NGOs was the focus of parliamentary debate in Cambodia in 2015. It will be interesting to see if any potential legislative change to the regulations reduces the size of investment in research by the not-for-profit sector.  Scientific output  The number of scientific publications authored by Cambodian scientists and catalogued in international journals grew by 17% on average between 2005 and 2014, a rate surpassed only by Malaysia, Singapore and Viet Nam. They were coming from a low starting point, however, since the volume of publications rose from 54 in 2005 to 206 in 2014. These publications had a narrow focus, with the majority focusing on biological and medical sciences between 2008 and 2014. Cambodia thus had a low publication density, with just 13 articles per million inhabitants in 2014, one of the lowest ratios in Southeast Asia. Only the Philippines (9 per million), Indonesia (6 per million) and Myanmar (1 per million) had a lower publication density. Cambodia is likely to remain reliant on international research collaboration and NGO support for some time. Between 2008 and 2013, 96% of Cambodian articles involved at least one international co-author, a trend which may explain the country's high citation rate. Of note is that Cambodians count both Asian (Thai and Japanese) and Western scientists (Americans, Britons and French) among their closest collaborators. One strategic policy issue will be how to align NGO research support on national strategic plans for development.

History After the Teutonic Order founded the settlement of present-day GrudziƒÖdz in 1291, the Order began building fortifications encompassing the town in the fourteenth-century. Formerly, a line of fortifications already existed on a scarp to the west of the settlement. It was in the years 1346-51 that the first granary, Bornwald Granary, was built, followed by several in 1364. By 1504, around modern-day Spichrzowa Street (lit. Granary Street), fourteen granaries had already been constructed, reflecting the importance of GrudziƒÖdz in trade of craftsmanship in the region. A century later, there were 16 granaries. The construction of the granaries on top of the town walls along the Vistula river was done so to be in close proximity with the river port, and thus take advantage of the flourishing grain trade. Due to the different elevations of town and river, the granaries, which from the river side look like imposing multi-stories buildings, from the town side feature only one or two floors. Other than for grain trading purposes, the granaries performed other functions, i.e. one of the granaries, between 1603 and 1608 (or 1618) served as a Lutheran place of worship. During the Deluge at the hand of the Swedes, most of the granaries were burned down and only six had survived during the Swedish siege of GrudziƒÖdz. Rebuilding works lasted until the eighteenth-century, as a consequence of which, in relation to the former granary plans, those rebuilt had been less wide, covering smaller parcels of land individually. The following, nineteenth-century, further framework granaries had been built along the river scarp and riverfront (presently non- existent). Five granaries burned down in 1903, some were utilised for housing via enlarging windows and creating balconies on each elevation. A monumental amount of damage occurred during the final Soviet Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive during 1945. The granaries were rebuilt between 1946 and 1966. Presently, some of the granary building still perform their storage function, some have been adapted for residential use, whilst others are occupied by the Museum of GrudziƒÖdz.

Career After graduating from University of Indonesia, Hamzah founded the KAMMI (Kesatuan Aksi Mahasiswa Muslim Indonesia/Indonesian Muslim University Students' Action Union) and became its first president in the political situation after the fall of Suharto. Later, he joined the Prosperous Justice Party after briefly working as an expert staff for the People's Consultative Assembly. He ran in the 2004 elections as a nominee for his home district of West Nusa Tenggara, and won a seat. In his first period, he admitted to receiving non-budgetary benefits from then- Minister of Fishery Rokhmin Dahuri, which resulted in him being reprimanded by the body's ethical council (Dewan Kehormatan) and was barred from holding a position until 2009. In 2009, however, he successfully ran for a re-election after winning 105,412 votes - the second highest in the district out of 10 elected representatives. During his second term, he caused a controversy by calling for the disbanding of the Corruption Eradication Commission. Also in the same term, he served as a member of the body's ethical council briefly during the 2011-2012 period. After placing first in the district for his second reelection in 2014 with 125,083 votes, he was elected as Deputy Speaker of the parliament on 2 October, during which the minority ruling coalition walked out from the parliament building due to a perceived unfairness of the majority opposition placing only their members on the body's speaker positions. On 11 March 2016, he was dismissed from Prosperous Justice Party for making several seemingly controversial, counter-productive and improper statements (a little bit stupid). In accordance, his former party proposed for another member of the parliament Ledia Hanifa Amaliah to replace him as Deputy Speaker. However, Hamzah is still active as Deputy Speaker as of December 2017. Following the dismissal, he sued his former party, winning up to the level of the Supreme Court which awarded him Rp 30 billion in damages (US$2.1 million). During the voting of the 2017 electoral law, opposition parties all walked out from the parliament's chamber. However, Hamzah decided to remain, despite his sole opposition to a section of the electoral law regulating a 20 percent presidential candidacy threshold with all other members remaining voting in favor of it.

It has received some attention in the lay community, and has been used to support the diet known as the Alkaline diet. According to the hypothesis, acid ash is produced by meat, poultry, cheese, fish, eggs, and grains. Alkaline ash is produced by fruits and vegetables, except cranberries, prunes and plums. Since the acid or alkaline ash designation is based on the residue left on combustion rather than the acidity of the food, foods such as citrus fruits that are generally considered acidic are actually considered alkaline producing in this diet. Existing data currently supports both the proponents as well as the opponents of this hypothesis. Recent literature reviews by both groups tend towards those references that support their viewpoint.  Research  Recent systematic reviews have been published which have methodically analyzed the weight of available scientific evidence, and have found no significant evidence to support the acid‚Äìash hypothesis in regard to prevention of osteoporosis. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of studies on the effect of dietary phosphate intake contradicted the expected results under the acid‚Äìash hypothesis with respect to calcium in the urine and bone metabolism. This result suggests use of this diet to prevent calcium loss from bone is not justified. Other meta-analyses which have investigated the effect of total dietary acid intake have also found no evidence that acid intake increases the risk for osteoporosis as would be expected under the acid-ash hypothesis. Another review looked at the effects of dairy product intake, which have been hypothesized to increase the acid load of the body through phosphate and protein components. This review found no significant evidence suggesting dairy product intake causes acidosis or increases risk for osteoporosis. A meta- analysis on the effects of alkaline potassium salts on calcium metabolism and bone health found that supplementation with alkaline potassium salts reduces loss of calcium in urine and reduces acid secretion.  Relation to alkaline diets  The acid ash hypothesis suggests that diets high in \\"acid ash\\" (acid producing) elements would cause the body to try to buffer (or counteract) any additional acid load in the body by breaking down bone, leading to weaker bones and increased risk for osteoporosis. Consequently, \\"alkaline ash\\" (alkaline producing) elements would hypothetically decrease the risk of osteoporosis. This hypothesis has been advanced in a position statement of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, in a publication of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences,Food and Nutrition Board. Dietary Reference Intakes for Water, Potassium, Sodium, Chloride, and Sulfate (2005), page 189. National Academies Press. as well as other scientific publications, which have stated foods high in potassium and magnesium such as fruits and vegetables may decrease the risk of osteoporosis through increased alkaline ash production. However, this acceptance of the acid-ash hypothesis as a major modifiable risk factor of osteoporosis by these publications was largely made without significant critical review by high quality systematic analysis. It has also been speculated that an alkaline diet may have an effect on muscle wasting, growth hormone metabolism or back pain, though there is no conclusive evidence to confirm these hypotheses. Given an aging population, the effects of an alkaline diet on public health may offer some benefits due to its focus on an increase in fresh fruits and vegetables, but there are limited scientific studies on the topic.

It is designed for multiscale computational analysis of structure and dynamics of atomic clusters and nanoparticles, biomolecules and nanosystems, nanostructured materials, different states of matter and various interfaces. The software has been developed by MBN Research Center.  History  MBN Explorer inherited the experience obtained on the development of the software package Cluster Searcher. It started around 2000 as a classical molecular dynamics code for simulating many-body systems interacting via the Morse and the Lennard-Jones potentials. A variety of interatomic potentials and the possibility to combine a group of atoms into rigid blocks were introduced in 2005‚Äì2007. The first version of MBN Explorer was released in 2012 as a multipurpose computer code allowing to model different molecular systems of varied level of complexity.  Features  MBN Explorer allows for the multiscale description of molecular systems by means of kinetic Monte Carlo approach and the irradiation-driven molecular dynamics. By means of the Monte Carlo approach, the software allows to simulate diffusion-drive processes involving molecular systems on much larger time scales that can be reached in conventional molecular dynamics simulations. The software allows to combine different types of interatomic potentials to specify more than one interaction to a particular atom or a group of atoms. MBN Explorer supports several standard atomic trajectory formats, such as XYZ (text format), DCD (binary format) and DCD+XYZ (hybrid format). It also supports the Protein Data Bank (pdb) file format for describing the three-dimensional structures of biomolecules. Advanced features of the program include: * flexible coarse graining and the possibility to simulate dynamics of rigid bodies, * the possibility to perform relativistic molecular dynamics simulations of ultra- relativistic particles in crystalline media, * simulation of irradiation- induced chemical transformations by means of irradiation-driven molecular dynamics.  MBN Studio  MBN Explorer is complemented with MBN Studio  a multi-task program for molecular modeling and design, as well as for visualization and analysis of results of the simulations performed with MBN Explorer. The built-in molecular modeler can be used to construct isolated and solvated biomolecules, condensed molecular materials, carbon nanotubes and graphene sheets, nanoparticles and crystalline samples.  Projects and collaborations  MBN Explorer has been utilized in different research projects in the fields of materials science, nanotechnology and radiation damage: * ARGENT - Advanced Radiotherapy, Generated by Exploiting Nanoprocesses and Technologies This is a multidisciplinary network project involving different research groups, academic and industrial partners.

His baptismal name was Jan (Joannes). At the age of 17 he entered the monastic order of the Piarists in Rzesz√≥w and took on the name Damian of the Most Holy Trinity (Damianus √† SS. Trinitate). On 9 June 1675 he received the religious habit, and as early as 6 August of the same year he arrived at Podolinec, where he stayed until 1677 teaching the classes in poetry and rhetoric, as well as performing musical tasks. Since 1678 he had resided in the monastery in Prievidza, and studied philosophy and theology. Most probably he was still occupied with music (which we can surmise on the basis of a large number of compositions mentioned in the music inventory of that place). In the years 1681‚Äì1690 he worked in Warsaw where on 21 December 1685 he was ordained to the priesthood. We may also find more detailed information about his musical responsibilities (‚Äúmgr chori et Musices‚Äù), which included education of the youth. Since 1691 Stachowicz had dwelled in ≈Åowicz and his duties were to conduct the choir, to teach rhetoric and theology, to head the school (at least since 1696) and finally to be the deputy rector of the college (since 1698).

Facts Mr Yaseen Aslam and Mr James Farrar claimed that they should be paid the minimum wage under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and receive paid annual leave under the Working Time Regulations 1998 while working as drivers for Uber. Uber BV, a Dutch incorporated subsidiary of Uber argued that their drivers were self-employed independent contractors, and that it owed them no worker or employee obligations. Its contracts described Mr Aslam and Mr Farrar as \\"partners\\" and stated that \\"nothing shall create an employment relationship between Uber and the partner\\". Aslam and Farrar argued that this was a sham. Under the Employment Rights Act 1996 section 230 (and equivalent sections in the NMWA 1998) a \\"worker\\" who is entitled to the minimum wage or paid holidays is anyone (a) with a contract of employment or (b) anyone who personally performs work but not for a client or customer. Mr Aslam and Mr Farrar contended they were workers (without specifying which type). Judgment Employment tribunal The employment tribunal unanimously held that Mr Aslam and Mr Farrar were \\"workers\\" within the definition in s.230(3)(b) of the Employment Rights Act 1996, and were thus entitled to the minimum wage and holiday pay. The tribunal did not specify whether the claimants were also employees. As to Uber's tactics in pursuing its case, the Tribunal observed: The Tribunal gave the following reasons for arriving at its decision:ET, par. 87‚Äì97 #An organisation resorting in its documentation to fictions, twisted language and even brand new terminology, merited a degree of scepticism. #There were many things said and written in the name of Uber in unguarded moments, which reinforce the Claimants' simple case that the organisation runs a transportation business and employs the drivers to that end. #It is unreal to deny that Uber is in business as a supplier of transportation services. #Uber's general case and the written terms on which they rely do not correspond with the practical reality. #The logic of Uber's case became all the more difficult as it was developed. #It was not real to regard Uber as working \\"for\\" the drivers and that the only sensible interpretation is that the relationship was the other way around. #The drivers fell full square within the terms of the 1996 Act, s 230(3)(b). #The guidance in the principal authorities favoured the conclusion. #The authorities relied upon by Uber's counsel did not support the conclusion for which he argued. #The terms on which Uber rely do not correspond with the reality of the relationship between the organisation and the drivers. Accordingly, the Tribunal is free to disregard them. #None of the above reasoning should be taken as doubting that the Respondents could have devised a business model not involving them employing drivers. The Tribunal found only that the model which they chose failed to achieve that aim. Employment Appeal Tribunal The Employment Appeal Tribunal dismissed the appeal on 10 November 2017. In her ruling, HHJ Eady stated: Court of Appeal The majority of the Court of Appeal (Sir Terence Etherton MR and Bean LJ) upheld the Employment Appeal Tribunal decision, so that Uber drivers are workers entitled to the minimum wage and paid holidays. The joint majority judgment said the following: Underhill LJ dissented, saying the following. Appeal to the Supreme Court Uber announced that, having been granted permission to appeal, it would do so to the UK Supreme Court. The hearing before the Supreme Court took place on 21 July 2020.

A cultural icon of the city, it was built in 1862-1864 to the designs of the Italian architect Pietro Samp√≤ and opened on 20 April 1864.http://www.syrosisland.gr/en/apollon-theatre-syros/ History In Ermoupoli, during the period 1830-1860 there was a great theatrical movement. On 30 October 1861, the City Council accepted the citizens' proposals and unanimously decided to build a theatre and a theater club in the central square. The construction costs of the theater were estimated at 60,000 drachmas, but in spite of controversy, a permanent roof replaced the wooden warehouses, clubs and cafes of Ermoupoli which had sheltered players since 1828. It was received with relief from the theater-loving public. Construction began at the end of 1862, close to the Miaouli Square, supervised by the architect Pietro Sambo who then worked as an architect in the town hall of Ermoupolis. On 20 April 1864, it was opened in the presence of Michalis Salvagos.? obviously not :el:ŒúŒπœáŒ±ŒÆŒª Œö. Œ£Œ±ŒªŒ≤Œ¨Œ≥ŒøœÇ The first performances were, following the opening night's Rigoletto, four melodramas: La favorita, La traviata, the Survivors and the Cobblers, played by an Italian company. In April 1866, the theater was given to a Greek theater company, the Hellenic Drama Society, a move which, in a letter dated 22 February 1866, Ragavis (as chairman of the National Theater Committee) had recommended to the Apollo Theater Committee. The building underwent major overhauls in 1874, 1881, 1890 (seats and scene) and 1896 (general). After the construction of the new building, the development of the theatrical movement continued, following the prosperity of the city. The theater bloomed throughout the interwar period and the greatest names of modern Greek theater appeared on its stage.  Wartime damage  During the Second World War, the theater suffered disasters which necessitated post-war interventions, altering the building's appearance. During the Greco-Italian War, the theatre was being abused as a cinema. During the following years, it was never brought back to its original condition, although after the war there were some theatrical performances, with the lead of Marika Kotopouli, who gave on 24 March 1953 the last performance of her career. The Apollo Theater was considered unsuitable for operation. In 1959, the municipality decided to renovate it. General repair began in 1970 and caused an internal damage. The wooden vaults were replaced with concrete balconies. The activities of the \\"Syros Apollon Theatrical Club\\" (founded in 1977) and \\"Souris Artistic Group\\" (1978), which showed films in the theater to stimulate the interest of the public, were very important. The first phase of renovation, funded by the state and the EEC, was completed in 1991. The theater reopened for the first time in about 40 years later with the 4th Meeting of Amateur Theaters of the Aegean (29 October to 8 November 1991) where the Cultural Association of Ano Syros took part in. The new wallpapers were created in 1998 by Dimitris Fortsas.  Today  Reconstruction works were completed in 2000 by architect Petros Pikionis, approved by the Ministry of Culture and under the supervision and with support from the Technical Services of the municipality. The capacity of the theater today is 350 people. Since 2002, it has been operating in the field of theater, with varied exhibits of posters, costumes of various presentations and more. Today, it hosts various cultural events and festivals, such as the Aegean Festival, the Animasyros International Film Festival and the International Cycladic Classical Music Festival. Architecture The ceiling The Apollo Theater has been regarded as a miniature of La Scala. Its architecture has been influenced by Italian standards and its design is influenced by at least four of them: the La Scala (1776), the restored Teatro di San Carlo in Naples (1816), the Academic Theater in Castellranco (1745), and the Teatro della pergola of Florence (1755). The support of the vaults follows the French system of the period. The theater has no rich exterior architectural decoration. It is a simple two-storey building with a low marble plinth and plastered facades. The floors are divided by a strip of limestone and have a cornice in the ground floor. In the central part of the main face, all of marble, the vertical axis with four pillars all over the height, bearing a shield, is strongly emphasized. The entire building has a single cornice, arched openings on the ground floor and rectangular on the floor.http://www.syrosisland.gr/en/apollon-theatre- syros/http://www.festivaloftheaegean.com/theater.html The stage is 9 m wide, 10 m deep. and limited to the requirements of the European lyrical theater, but keeping the proportions of the Italian tradition. The decoration of the vouchers is simple, with light colours and frames with embossed rosettes in the center and gold plated jewelry at the corners. The seats, rails and wing curtains are velvet. In the middle of the ceiling wallpapers depict poets and composers.

As part of the Union Navy, she saw service during the American Civil War. Service history  Confederate service  Early in the American Civil War, Isilda operated under the British flag as a Confederate blockade runner. She sailed from Havana, Cuba, on 26 September 1861, cleared for Matamoros, Mexico. The U.S. Navy armed screw steamer captured her in the Gulf of Mexico 4 to 5 nautical miles (7.4 to 9.3 km) off Timbalier Light, Louisiana, on 30 September 1861 and claimed her as a prize .  U.S. Navy service  The U.S. Navy took possession of Isilda and fitted her out as a tender. She joined the Gulf Blockading Squadron on 1 November 1861 to serve as tender to USS South Carolina in support of the Union blockade of the Confederacy in the Gulf of Mexico. For a short time, Isilda was on duty off the Mississippi Delta, but her most distinguished service was performed off the west coast of Florida. Isilda fired a shot across the bow of an unidentified schooner standing in for shore off Cedar Key, Florida, on 24 April 1862. When the vessel refused to heave to, Isilda gave chase until the blockade runner slipped into shoal water and ran hard aground; on 26 April 1862, as an armed launch from Isilda was pulling toward the grounded schooner, a column of black smoke rose from the stern of the blockade runner and she blew up with a loud report. Isilda scored again on 10 June 1862 when she surprised the Confederate steamer Havana in Deadman's Bay on the coast of Florida and forced Havana‚Ä≤s crew to put her to the torch to prevent capture. On 24 March 1863, with the schooner , she chased the Confederate sloop Ranger, enabling the sidewheel paddle steamer to capture Ranger and her cargo of salt, dry goods, and gunpowder off Crystal River, Florida. By April 1863, after participating in an expedition which scoured the west coast of Florida from the mouth of the Suwanee River to the Anclote Keys, Isilda showed signs of serious wear and tear. She remained on station off Cedar Key until 11 June 1863 when she finally sailed to Key West, Florida, for repairs. There, when a survey found her too badly battered for economical repair, and she was condemned, stripped, and sold at public auction.

Red Pecorino is made from sheep's milk and Sicilian filate pastes in a technique known as pasta filata which is used in the manufacture of a family of Italian cheeses also known as stretched-curd, pulled-curd, and plastic-curd. The production of Red Pecorino is officially recognized and included in the list of food products of traditional Italian cuisine (A.P.T), the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. In Italian regions such as Tuscany and Sardinia, other cheeses are called by their original name. The red Sicilian Pecorino however, is referred to as seasoning. Red Pecorino is made from tomato sauce and plain sheep's milk. Saffron or chili pepper are added during production. Features Red Pecorino takes its name from its unique method of preparation. After being rubbed with seasoning and olive oil, the cheese is stained with tomato sauce, providing its signature red color. The cheese itself is processed manually, starting with the formation process, which occurs when the cheese is about two months old and still tender and fresh. The olive oil and tomato sauce are mixed together and applied as a protective layer over the cheese. It is in this state that the cheese matures.

Language The name of the Mutumui language, now extinct, was Eibole, of which a dialect called Ongwara ('northern talk') was spoken to their north. Country The Mutumui's traditional territory spread out over an estimated , covering the area of Bathurst Bay and Cape Melville southwards, at Barrow Point and the vicinity of the Starcke and Jeannie Rivers. Social organization and people The Mutumui were divided into several hordes/bands, each speaking a distinct dialect version of Mutumui, and of which the probable names of two are known:- * Karbungga. This was the band at the Jeannie River * Mbambylmu. at Jack River. * Ithu? Though tooth avulsion was practiced in the area, among the Mutumui is reported to have formed part of the initiatory ceremony itself. The Mutumui were essentially shore dwellers, mainly in the area around Murdoch Point and Bathurst Bay. They would make forays into the sandstone hinterland on occasion in pursuit of honey, and to hunt opossums and rock wallabies. History The Palmer river goldrush following from its discovery in the area 1873 led to a large influx of people seeking to pan for quick riches during the decade of the 1870s, and this surge led to conflict and massacres during the subsequent occupation of the general region just south of the Mutumui.

Power has been challenged by Michael Marshall from the Merseyside Skeptics Society (MSS) to prove his psychic capabilities, Power choose to decline.  Career  Power has been active as a stage performer of mediumship since 2004, touring around the UK and Ireland. He also offers one-to-one sessions, readings and courses claimed to aid development and training in psychic powers. In May 2009, Penguin published The Man Who Sees Dead People, Power's autobiographical account detailing his early life with his claimed psychic abilities and his brother's murder.  Controversy  Power appeared as the main subject in the first episode of the first series of the Channel 4 show Derren Brown Investigates, in which Brown investigated his claimed psychic abilities through rewatching his live stage events, sitting in on celebrity readings and organising independent private readings. One such reading was with Hollyoaks actress Claire Cooper, during which Power asked if Cooper drove a Mini, which she confirmed. However, in Power and Brown's final talk, Brown stated that one of his crew saw Cooper pull up in her car next to Power. Another feature of the show involved Brown setting up a reading with a non- skeptic, named Ros, but giving her the fake name of 'Pam' and asking Power to meet her in a house that was not her own, supposedly to test Power's psychic abilities by reducing the amount of research he could do beforehand. This reading was shown as being poor in comparison to other readings Power had done earlier in the show. Again, Power alleged that Brown and Objective Productions had acted unfairly towards him, as Brown had met Ros before Power himself had met her, despite what he understood to be a statement that she hadn't met Brown. Power later filed a complaint with Ofcom. He told the Liverpool Echo: \\"Originally I was told the programme was going to be called Derren Brown Unexplained and I thought it would be fair... But I was made to feel uncomfortable from the start. I felt like it was an interrogation. The edited version showed me being abusive, but I wasn't, I was just very annoyed at what they were doing.\\" Ofcom dismissed the complaint. In 2010, Power was challenged by Michael Marshall from the Merseyside Skeptics Society (MSS) to prove his psychic capabilities. If he was successful, MSS would remove from their website all material critical of Power's work. Power declined the challenge and instead accused Marshall of sending him death threats, an accusation which was later dismissed as unfounded by Ormskirk Police.

This was the last campaign of the War of the First Coalition, part of the French Revolutionary Wars. The French military strategy against Austria rested on a three-pronged invasion to surround Vienna, ideally capturing the city and forcing the Holy Roman Emperor into a surrender and acceptance of French Revolutionary ideals. Toward this end, the French assembled three armies: Army of Sambre-et-Meuse commanded by Jean-Baptiste Jourdan faced the Austrian Army of the Lower Rhine in the north; the Army of Rhin-et-Moselle, led by Jean Victor Marie Moreau, confronted the Austrian Army of the Upper Rhine in the south; the Army of Italy approached Vienna through northern Italy. Initially successes of the Army of Italy forced the Coalition commander, Archduke Charles, to transfer 25,000 men commanded by Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser to northern Italy. This weakened the Coalition force along the of the Rhine from Basel to the North Sea. A feint by Jourdan's Army of Sambre-et-Meuse convinced Charles to shift troops to the north, allowing Moreau to cross of the Rhine at Kehl on 24 June and beat the Archduke's Imperial contingents. Both French armies penetrated deeply into eastern and southern Germany by late July, forcing the southern states of the Holy Roman Empire into punitive armistices. By August, though, the French armies had extended their fronts too thinly and the competition and jealousies between and among the French generals complicated cooperation between the two armies. Because the two French armies operated independently, Archduke Charles was able to leave Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour with a weaker army in front of Moreau on the southernmost flank, and move heavy reinforcements to help Wilhelm von Wartensleben's army in the north. In battles at Amberg on 24 August and W√ºrzburg on 3 September Charles defeated Jourdan and compelled the French army to retreat, eventually to the west bank of the Rhine. With Jourdan neutralized and retreating into France, Charles left Franz von Werneck to watch the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse, making sure it did not try to recover a foothold on the east bank of the Rhine, and turned on Moreau, who belatedly began to withdraw from southern Germany. Although Moreau briskly repulsed Latour at Biberach, he did not make it through the Black Forest before Charles was able to cut French access to the Bruchsal and Kehl crossings. In the battles of Emmendingen and Schliengen in October, Charles forced Moreau to retreat to the west bank of the Rhine. During the winter the Austrians reduced the French bridgeheads at Kehl and Huningue (H√ºningen). Despite Charles' success in Germany, Austria was losing the war in Italy to a new French army commander, Napoleon Bonaparte. Background Initially, the rulers of Europe viewed the French Revolution as a dispute between the French king and his subjects, and not something in which they should interfere. As revolutionary rhetoric grew more strident, they declared the interest of the monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis XVI and his family; this Declaration of Pillnitz (27 August 1791) threatened ambiguous, but quite serious, consequences if anything should happen to the royal family. The position of the revolutionaries became increasingly difficult. Compounding their problems in international relations, French √©migr√©s continued to agitate for support of a counter-revolution. Finally, on 20 April 1792, the French National Convention declared war on Austria. In this War of the First Coalition (1792‚Äì98), France ranged itself against most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her, plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire.Timothy Blanning. The French Revolutionary Wars, New York: Oxford University Press, 1998, pp. 41‚Äì59. Despite some victories in 1792, by early 1793, France was in terrible crisis: French forces had been pushed out of Belgium; also there was revolt in the Vend√©e over conscription; widespread resentment of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy; and the French king had just been executed. The armies of the French Republic were in a state of disruption; the problems became even more acute following the introduction of mass conscription, the lev√©e en masse, which saturated an already distressed army with thousands of illiterate, untrained men. R. Dupuy, Nouvelle histoire de la France contemporaine. La R√©publique jacobine, 2005, p.156. For the French, the Rhine Campaign of 1795 proved especially disastrous, although they had achieved some success in other theaters of war (see for example, War of the Pyrenees (1793‚Äì95)). The armies of the First Coalition included the imperial contingents and the infantry and cavalry of the various states, amounting to about 125,000 (including three autonomous corps), a sizable force by eighteenth century standards but a moderate force by the standards of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars. In total, the commander-in-chief Archduke Charles' troops stretched from Switzerland to the North Sea and Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser's, from the Swiss-Italian border to the Adriatic. Habsburg troops comprised the bulk of the army, but the thin white line of Habsburg infantry could not cover the territory from Basel to Frankfurt with sufficient depth to resist the pressure of their opponents.Habsburg infantry wore white coats. Gunther E. Rothenberg, \\"The Habsburg Army in the Napoleonic Wars (1792‚Äì1815)\\". Military Affairs, 37:1 (Feb 1973), 1‚Äì5. Compared to French coverage, Charles had half the number of troops covering a front that stretched from Renchen near Basel to Bingen. Furthermore, he had concentrated the bulk of his force, commanded by Count Baillet Latour, between Karlsruhe and Darmstadt, where the confluence of the Rhine and the Main made an attack most likely; the rivers offered a gateway into eastern German states and ultimately to Vienna, with good bridges crossing a relatively well-defined river bank. To his north, Wilhelm von Wartensleben's autonomous corpsAn autonomous corps, in the Austrian or Imperial armies, was an armed force under command of an experienced field commander. They usually included two divisions, but probably not more than three, and function with high maneuverability and independent action, hence the name \\"autonomous corps.\\" Some, called the Frei-Corps, or independent corps, were used as light infantry before the official formation of light infantry in the Habsburg Army in 1798. They provided the Army's skirmishing and scouting function; Frei-Corps were usually raised from the provinces. See Philip Haythornthwaite, Austrian Army of the Napoleonic Wars (1): Infantry. Osprey Publishing, 2012, p. 24. Military historians usually maintain that Napoleon solidified the use of the autonomous corps, armies that could function without a great deal of direction, scatter about the countryside, but reform again quickly for battle; this was actually a development that first emerged first in the French and Indian War in the Thirteen British Colonies and later in the American Revolutionary War, and became widely used in the European military as the size of armies grew in the 1790s and during the Napoleonic Wars. See David Gates, The Napoleonic Wars 1803-1815, New York, Random House, 2011, Chapter 6. covered the line between Mainz and Giessen. The Austrian army consisted of professionals, many moved from the border regions in the Balkans, and conscripts drafted from the Imperial Circles.Gunther E. Rothenberg, \\"The Habsburg Army in the Napoleonic Wars (1792‚Äì1815)\\". Military Affairs, 37:1 (Feb 1973), 1‚Äì5, 1‚Äì2 cited.Beginning in the sixteenth century, the Holy Roman Empire was organized loosely into ten \\"circles\\", or regional groups of ecclesiastical, dynastic, and secular polities that coordinated economic, military and political actions. During times of war, the Circles contributed troops to the Habsburg military by drafting (or soliciting volunteers) among their inhabitants. Some circles coordinated their efforts better than others; the Swabian Circle was among the more effective of the imperial circles at organizing itself and protecting its economic interests. See James Allen Vann, The Swabian Kreis: Institutional Growth in the Holy Roman Empire 1648‚Äì1715.

Two French generals, Jean- Baptiste Jourdan and Jean Victor Moreau, commanded (respectively) the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse and the Army of Rhin-et-Moselle at the outset of the 1796 campaign. The French citizens' army was created by mass conscription of young men and systematically divested of old men who might have tempered the rash impulses of teenagers and young adults. It had already made itself odious, by rumor and action, throughout France. Furthermore, it was an army entirely dependent upon the countryside for its material support. After April 1796, pay was made in metallic value, but pay was still in arrears. Throughout the spring and early summer, the unpaid French army was in almost constant mutiny: in May 1796, in the border town of Zweibr√ºcken, the 74th Demi-brigade revolted. In June, the 17th Demi-brigade was insubordinate (frequently) and in the 84th Demi-brigade, two companies rebelled. The French commanders understood that an assault into the German states was essential, not only in terms of war aims, but also in practical terms: furthermore, the French Directory believed that war should pay for itself, and did not budget for the payment or feeding of its troops.Jean Paul Bertaud, R.R.

Terrain Geography Map of Rhine river shows D√ºsseldorf and the Sieg and Lahn rivers in the north and Strasbourg and Mannheim in the south. The colors different sections of the rhine River: blue is the Alp Rhine and the Lake Rhine (where the river runs through Lake Constance); turquoise indicates the High Rhine (which runs east to west through of Lake Constance); The Upper Rhine (green) begins where the river takes a sharp turn at the Rhine Knee, and flows south to north; yellow designates the Middle Rhine (sometimes called Mittelrhein) and orange designates the Low Rhine, where the Rhine passes into the Netherlands and reaches the North Sea. The Rhine river begins in the Canton of Graub√ºnden (also called the Grisons), near Lake Toma and flows along the alpine region bordered by Liechtenstein, northward into Lake Constance where it traverses the lake in three \\"ditches\\": Oberseerhein, Seerhein, and Unterseerhein, . From there, it leaves the lake at Reichenau and flows westerly along the border between the German states and the Swiss Cantons.These territories include present-day Baden-W√ºrttemberg and the Cantons of Schaffhausen, Aargau, Basel-land, and Basel-Stadt. Schaffhausen and Aargau attained canton status in the peace settlement of 1803, a de facto acceptance of the Swiss Revolution of 1798-99; Basel-land and Basel-Stadt were created from the Canton Basel in 1833. The stretch between Rheinfall, by Schaffhausen and Basel, called the High Rhine, cuts through steep hillsides and flows over a gravel bed; in such places as the former rapids at Laufenburg, it moved in torrents.Laufenburg now has dams and barrages to control the flow of water. Thomas P. Knepper. The Rhine. Handbook for Environmental Chemistry Series, Part L. New York: Springer, 2006, , pp. 5‚Äì19. At Basel, the terrain flattens. There the Rhine makes a wide, northerly turn, in what is called the Rhine knee, and enters the what the locals call the Rhine ditch (Rheingraben), part of a rift valley bordered by the Black Forest on the east and Vosges mountains on the west. Called the Upper Rhine (distinguished from the High Rhine), the river flows south to north. In 1796, the plain on both sides of the river, some wide, was dotted with villages and farms. At both far edges of the flood plain, especially on the eastern side, the old mountains created dark shadows on the horizon. Tributaries cut through the hilly terrain of the Black Forest, creating deep defiles in the mountains. The tributaries then wound in rivulets through the flood plain to the river.Thomas P.Knepper, The Rhine. Handbook for Environmental Chemistry Series, Part L. New York: Springer, 2006, , pp. 19‚Äì20 The Rhine River itself looked different in the 1790s than it does in the twenty-first century; the passage from Basel to Iffezheim was \\"corrected\\" (straightened) between 1817 and 1875 to make year-round transport easier. Between 1927 and 1975, the construction of a canal allowed the control of the water level. In the 1790s, though, the river was wild and unpredictable, in some places four or more times wider than the twenty-first century incarnation of the river, even under regular conditions. Its channels wound through marsh and meadow, and created islands of trees and vegetation that were periodically submerged by floods.

It was crossable at Kehl, by Strasbourg, and H√ºningen, by Basel, where systems of viaducts and causeways made access reliable.Thomas C Hansard (ed.).Hansard's Parliamentary Debates, House of Commons, 1803, Official Report. Vol. 1. London: HMSO, 1803, pp. 249‚Äì252. Political terrain The plethora of states of the Holy Roman Empire was especially dense on the east bank of the Rhine. In particular, the states involved in late 1796 included, for example, the Breisgau (Habsburg), Offenburg and Rottweil (free cities), the territories belonging to the princely families of F√ºrstenberg and Hohenzollern, the Duchy of Baden, the Duchy of W√ºrttemberg, and several dozen ecclesiastic polities. The light cream-colored territories are so subdivided they cannot be named. The German-speaking states on the east bank of the Rhine were part of the vast complex of territories in central Europe called the Holy Roman Empire.Joachim Whaley, Germany and the Holy Roman Empire: Volume I: Maximilian I to the Peace of Westphalia, 1493‚Äì1648 Oxford University Press, 23012, vol.1 pp. 17-20 The considerable number of territories in the Empire included more than 1,000 entities. Their size and influence varied, from the Kleinstaaterei, the little states that covered no more than a few square miles, or included several non- contiguous pieces, to the small and complex territories of the princely Hohenlohe family branches, to such sizable, well-defined territories as the Kingdoms of Bavaria and Prussia. The governance of these many states varied: they included the autonomous free imperial cities, also of different sizes and influence, from the powerful Augsburg to the minuscule Weil der Stadt; ecclesiastical territories, also of varying sizes and influence, such as the wealthy Abbey of Reichenau and the powerful Archbishopric of Cologne; and dynastic states such as W√ºrttemberg. When viewed on a map, the Empire resembled a \\"patchwork carpet\\". Both the Habsburg domains and Hohenzollern Prussia also included territories outside the Empire. There were also territories completely surrounded by France that belonged to W√ºrttemberg, the Archbishopric of Trier, and Hesse-Darmstadt. Among the German-speaking states, the Holy Roman Empire's administrative and legal mechanisms provided a venue to resolve disputes between peasants and landlords, between jurisdictions, and within jurisdictions. Through the organization of Imperial Circles, also called Reichskreise, groups of states consolidated resources and promoted regional and organizational interests, including economic cooperation and military protection. Many of these territories were not contiguous: a village could belong predominantly to one polity, but have a farmstead, a house, or even one or two strips of land that belonged to another polity.See, for example, James Allen Vann, Swabian Kreis: Institutional Growth in the Holy Roman Empire 1648‚Äì1715, vol 52, Studies Presented to International Commission for the History of Representative and Parliamentary Institutions, vol. 52, 1975, Brussels. Walker, Mack German home towns: community, state, and general estate, 1648‚Äì1871, Cornell University Press, 1998 French strategy At the end of the Rhine Campaign of 1795 the two sides had called a truce.Theodore Ayrault Dodge, Warfare in the Age of Napoleon: The Revolutionary Wars Against the First Coalition in Northern Europe and the Italian Campaign, 1789-1797, Leonaur Ltd, 2011 , pp.286‚Äì287. However, war plans did not cease. In a decree on 6 January 1796, Lazare Carnot gave Germany priority over Italy as a theater of war. Jean-Baptiste Jourdan commanding the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse was instructed to besiege Mainz and cross the Rhine into Franconia. Farther south, Jean Victor Marie Moreau was to lead the Army of Rhin-et-Moselle across the Rhine, besiege or take Mannheim, and invade Duchy of Baden, Swabia, and the Duchy of Bavaria. Ultimate, Moreau was to converge on Vienna while Jourdan would veer south to provide a rear guard. On the secondary front, Napoleon Bonaparte was to invade Italy, neutralize the Kingdom of Sardinia and seize Lombardy from the Austrians. Hopefully, the Italian army would cross the Alps via the County of Tyrol and join the other French armies in crushing the Austrian forces in southern Germany. By the spring of 1796, Jourdan and Moreau each had 70,000 men while Bonaparte's army numbered 63,000, including reserves and garrisons. Additionally, Fran√ßois Christophe de Kellermann counted 20,000 troops in the Army of the Alps and there was an even smaller army in southern France. The French First Republic's finances were in poor shape so its armies were expected to invade new territories and then live off the conquered lands.David G. Chandler, The Campaigns of Napoleon Macmillan, 1966, pp. 46-47 Coalition and French forces Knowing that the French planned to invade southern Germany, on 20 May 1796 the Austrians announced that the truce would end on 31 May, and prepared for invasion.Ramsay Weston Phipps , The Armies of the First French Republic: Volume II: The Arm√©es du Moselle, du Rhin, de Sambre-et-Meuse, de Rhin-et-Moselle, Pickle Partners Publishing, 2011 , p. 278 The Army of the Lower Rhine was commanded by the 25-year-old Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen and counted 90,000 troops. The 20,000-man right wing under Duke Ferdinand Frederick Augustus of W√ºrttemberg was on the east bank of the Rhine behind the Sieg River observing the French bridgehead at D√ºsseldorf. The garrisons of Mainz Fortress and Ehrenbreitstein Fortress counted 10,000 more. The remainder of Charles' army patrolled the west bank and behind the Nahe River. Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser led the 80,000-strong Army of the Upper Rhine. Its right wing occupied Kaiserslautern on the west bank while the left wing under Anton Szt√°ray, Michael von Fr√∂hlich and Louis Joseph, Prince of Cond√© guarded the Rhine from Mannheim to Switzerland. The original Austrian strategy was to capture Trier and to use this position on the west bank to strike at each of the French armies in turn. However, Wurmser was sent to Italy with 25,000 reinforcements after news arrived of Bonaparte's early successes. In the new situation, the Aulic Council gave Archduke Charles command over both Austrian armies and the Imperial contingents of the Holy Roman Empire, and ordered him to hold his ground. Imperial contingents were usually raw recruits drafted from the administrative districts of the Empire. In Spring, 1796, when resumption of war appeared eminent, the 88-members of the Swabian Circle, which included most of the states (ecclesiastical, secular, and dynastic) in Upper Swabia, had raised a small force of about 7,000 men. These were field hands and day laborers drafted for service, but untrained in military matters. It was largely guess work where they should be placed, and Charles did not like to use the militias in any vital location.Digby Smith, Napoleonic Wars Data Book. Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania: Stackpole, 1999. pp. 111‚Äì114. In early late May and early June, when the French started to mass troops by Mainz as if they would cross there‚Äîthey even engaged the Imperial force at Altenkirchen (4 June) and Wetzler and Uckerath (15 June)‚ÄîCharles thought that main attack would occur there and felt few qualms placing the 7,000 Swabians at the crossing by Kehl.Smith, p. 114. At the start of the campaign, the 80,000-man Army of Sambre-et-Meuse held the west bank of the Rhine down to the Nahe and then southwest to Sankt Wendel. On the army's left flank, Jean-Baptiste Kl√©ber had 22,000 troops in an entrenched camp at D√ºsseldorf. Carnot's grand plan called for the two French armies to press against the Austrian flanks. But first, Jourdan's army would push south from D√ºsseldorf. It was hoped that this advance would induce the Austrians to withdraw all of their forces from the Rhine's west bank. It would also focus Austrian attention northward, allowing Moreau's army to more easily strike in the south. The right wing of the Army of Rhin-et-Moselle was positioned behind the Rhine from Huningue (H√ºningen) northward, its center was along the Queich River near Landau and its left wing extended west toward Saarbr√ºcken. Pierre Marie Barth√©lemy Ferino led Moreau's Right Wing, Louis Desaix commanded the Center and Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr directed the Left Wing. Ferino's wing consisted of three divisions under Fran√ßois Antoine Louis Bourcier, 9,281 infantry and 690 cavalry, Henri Fran√ßois Delaborde, 8,300 infantry and 174 cavalry and Augustin Tuncq, 7,437 infantry and 432 cavalry. Desaix's command counted three divisions led by Michel de Beaupuy, 14,565 infantry and 1,266 cavalry, Antoine Guillaume Delmas, 7,898 infantry and 865 cavalry and Charles Antoine Xaintrailles, 4,828 infantry and 962 cavalry. Saint-Cyr's wing had two divisions commanded by Guillaume Philibert Duhesme, 7,438 infantry and 895 cavalry and Alexandre Camille Taponier, 11,823 infantry and 1,231 cavalry. Altogether, Moreau's Army of Rhin-et-Moselle numbered 71,581 foot soldiers and 6,515 cavalry. Gunners and sappers are not included in the total.Digby Smith The Napoleonic Wars Data Book, Greenhill, 1998, pp. 111 Actions Blockades On 9 June 1796, 36000 French troops blockaded the fortresses at Mainz and Ehrenbreitstein, challenging important strongholds at the confluence of the Main and Rhine rivers, and the Rhine and Moselle rivers, The blockades at Ehrenbreitstein started on 9 June, and at Mainz on 14 June.Smith, p. 124. Maudach On 15 June, at the village of Maudauch, 36 miles from Speyer, and a few kilometers from Ludwigshafen, 27,000 French infantry and 3,000 cavalry set upon 11,000 Imperial and Habsburg troops. The coalition lost 10 percent of its force, missing killed or wounded. Louis Desaix, commanding the left (northern) column of the Army of the Rhine and Moselle, had about 27,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry when he crossed the Rhine at Maudach. He faced Petrasch's division of about a third of the size, including mixed troops of infantry and dragoons.Smith, p. 114 While Desaix crossed at Maudauch, Jourdan's main body crossed the Rhine on 10 June at Neuwied to join Kl√©ber and the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse advanced to the Lahn river.Dodege, p. 288Smith, p. 115 Wetzlar and Uckerath At Wetzlar (15 June 1796), 11,000 French troops engaged part of the Habsburg Austrian army in its defenses on the Lahn river. The action ended in a Coalition victory when most of the French army began retreating to the west bank of the Rhine. Not all the Coalition force was engaged, but it was sufficiently strong to repel the French, who withdrew and split their force, Jourdan moving westward to secure the bridgehead at Neuwied, which he held unchallenged until the fall, and Kleber retreating northward toward D√ºsseldorf. Four days later, on the 19th, in a second engagement at Uckerath, the Coalition troops attacked Kleber's the French left wing in its retreat the French suffered more casualties than the Coalition force, and lost one of their colors.Smith, pp. 114-115. Renchen On 28 June at Renchen a French force of 20,000 overwhelmed a Coalition force of 6,000. Moreau' troops clashed with elements of a Habsburg Austrian army under Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour which were defending the line of the Murg River. Leading the left (north) wing of Moreau's army, Louis Desaix attacked the Austrians and drove them back to the Alb River.Smith, p. 115. Neuwied On 21 July, at Neuwied, Jourdan's southernmost flank encountered 8,000 Imperial troops, including a small group of Hessians, a battalion of French emigre troops, and the contingent from M√ºnster.Smith, p. 116. Giessen On 8 July at Giessen, a small town in Hesse, 20,000 French troops, part of Jourdan's Army of the Sambre-et-Meuse, surprised an Austrian garrison or 4,500 and captured the town.Smith, p. 116-117. Friedberg On 10 July, after hearing about Moreau's successful assault on Keh and subsequent crossing of the Rhine, Jourdan took the 30,000 men of the Army of the Sambre- et-Meuse back across the Rhine and attacked the 6,000 men of Wartensleben's force.Smith, p. 117. Cannstatt On 21 July, at Cannstatt, a small town on the east bank of the Neckar outside of Stuttgart, part of Moreau's Army of the Rhine & Moselle attacked and overwhelmed 8,000 coalition troops.

Geography Kyaik Htee Saung Pagoda is located on a laterite stone hillock near the town of Bilin. The hillock itself is formed by the layering of laterite stones on top of one another, forming a large square that gradually tapers upward. History According to tradition, in the Buddhist Era 111, the Gautama Buddha arrived at Kaylartha Mountain, Thuwunna Bonmi and preached to hermits and monks and then gave them pieces of his hair. Along with the hermits and monks, two belu brothers named Deiwa Kondala and Namani Kondala also received one piece of hair. In the Buddhist Era 113, the two brothers built a pagoda on a stone hill known as Mya Oo Taung and enclosed the hair in it. The pagoda was originally 63 cubits high and it was called Kyaik Kalookdek, meaning \\"A Pagoda Built by Devas\\" in the Mon language. The sacred hair of Buddha was put in a gold casket and enshrined in the pagoda. Daughters of the ogre brothers cut their hair to make ropes to put around the gold casket. So, the pagoda was called Kyaik Zoke Thoke, or \\"Hair- Rope Pagoda\\" in the Mon language. The village near the pagoda was also called Zoke Thoke Village. In the 236 Buddhist Era, King Culasirimasoka of Thuwunna Bonmi under the guidance of Ashin Sona and Ashin Ottara, enshrined a tooth relic of the Buddha in the pagoda. Over time, the pagoda became derelict due to a lack of care. The umbrella of the pagoda started tilting. Because of this, the pagoda was called Kyaik Htisaung, which means \\"The Pagoda with Tilting Umbrella\\" in the Mon language. Restoration Volunteers at Kyaikhtisaung help to unload a donation of rice and oil made by a local patron, circa 2017 In 1971 the monk U Pa√±√±ƒÅdipa, who later became the abbot of the monastery and well known as the Kyaikhtisaung Sayadaw, returned to his native village of Zoke Thoke. He found the old pagoda hidden under heavy growth. He then organized his disciples and local villagers to clear the area. Once the area was cleared, he rebuilt and renovated the old pagoda and old laterite hillock. For the next forty years following the beginning of his restoration project, the Kyaikhtisaung Sayadaw rebuilt, re-enshrined and preserved a total of nine sacred pagodas, each with a hair relic of Gautama Buddha. Currently, the Kyaikhtee Saung Golden Pagoda is a part of a large religious compound and monastery. Peacocks at the Kyaikhtisaung compound, circa 2016. the first Sayardaw kept many animals at the compound, including monkeys, horses, bears, and fowl. Stone inscriptions of U Khanti of Mandalay Hills Hermit U Khanti performed vast renovation projects throughout Myanmar during his lifetime, with a focus on remote hills and forest areas. One of his projects was to copy the Tripitakas donated by King Mindon onto marble slabs.

Their cars built more than a century earlier were used into the 21st century on the San Francisco cable car system and the White Pass and Yukon Route. Thomas Carter Thomas Carter was born in Ireland, and immigrated to the United States to work as a carriage-maker in western New York. He arrived in California via Panama in 1862 to become shop foreman of the Sacramento Valley Railroad. Thomas moved to Portland, Oregon in 1869 to build cars for the railroad to Oregon City. Martin Carter Thomas' brother Martin Carter worked as a carriage-maker for the Clark Carriage Factory across the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border in Toronto. Martin came to California in 1863 joining his brother working for the Sacramento Valley Railroad while their railroad shops were building horse-drawn street cars for the Market Street car line. When his brother left for Oregon, Martin applied his carpentry skills to building stairs for the California State Capitol and similarly grand buildings of Sacramento. History The two brothers moved to Sausalito, California in 1872 where they established a factory manufacturing cars for the San Francisco and North Pacific Railroad and the North Pacific Coast Railroad. A smaller factory in Monterey, California built cars for the Santa Cruz Railroad and the Monterey and Salinas Valley Railroad from Monterey to Salinas, California. Their partnership also contracted for construction of bridges on these railroads, and in 1876 moved their car factory to Newark, California to build over 700 cars for the South Pacific Coast Railroad of which Thomas Carter was the chief engineer and superintendent of construction. Carter Brothers offered very competitive prices using local materials to minimize transportation costs. Most cars were expertly assembled from Douglas fir and redwood lumber. Iron castings were made by foundries in San Francisco, Newark, Vallejo, and Santa Cruz; but the company used only higher quality eastern wheels from Whitney or Taylor. While most of the company production was boxcars and flatcars, they built a broad variety of passenger cars including a private railroad car for KalƒÅkaua, king of the Hawaiian Islands. Martin Carter supervised the Newark car shop while Thomas was the company business manager from offices in San Francisco. The company specialized in construction of narrow-gauge railway cars, and patented a passenger car bogie especially suitable for such cars. Another company patent for a specialized forest railway disconnected log bunk bogie brought equipment orders from many early logging railroads of the Pacific coast. Car manufacture ceased in 1897 after building an estimated five-thousand cars for California and locations as distant as Alaska, Oregon, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Hawaii, and Brazil. Thomas died in 1898, and the company officially closed when Martin retired in 1902, but the Newark shop produced a few more parts until the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.

From the very beginning, the Catawba allied themselves with the Confederacy, remaining loyal until the end of the War. They enrolled with the 5th, 12th, and 17th South Carolina Infantry Regiments. Background The Catawba Indians have lived in the South Carolina region for more than 5,000 years. The Catawba called themselves, yeh is-WAH h'reh or \\"People of the River.\\" The earliest documented European contact occurred when Hernando de Soto's Spanish expedition reached the Piedmont plateau. There would be no colonial contact for almost 100 years after the \\"De Soto Entrada.\\" As European settlers established themselves along the eastern coast, the Catawba became experienced traders. The deer skin market helped the Catawba receive European goods like muskets, iron knives, kettles, and cloth but also brought along disease and encroachment. In 1747, the Province of South Carolina allotted the Catawba 15 square miles in the York and Lancaster districts. American colonists considered the Catawba \\"the best friends the colonist had.\\" When the Revolutionary War started, there were between 1,000 to 5,000 or more Catawbas. It is said that more than 500 lost their lives during the Revolutionary War. The Catawbas served under General Lee's Legion and fought with him in 1780. For siding with the Americans during the revolution, the British destroyed the Catawba's major village. On March 13 of 1840, a treaty was made between South Carolina and the Catawba. At that time, their population was at 12 men, 36 women, and 40 boys & girls. When the Civil War began, the Catawba were \\"an obscure enclave in a social system [southern plantation slavery] that was beginning to break down.\\" They became a group dependent on the \\"Southern way of life\\" which they believed was \\"meaningful\\" and \\"worth fighting for.\\" In 1860, their population was at 55. An elderly Catawba who lived through the American Civil War noted that a \\"good many [Catawba Indians] went, about 20.\\" Eastern Theater The Catawba first enrolled in Captain Lucian Palmer Sadler's Company on December 9, 1861. Sadler became ill and had to retire after one year of service. The Company ultimately became part of the 17th South Carolina Infantry Regiment, as Company K. Only four Catawba Indians enrolled with this company: Jefferson Ayers, William Canty, John Scott, and Alexander Tims. In 1861, Cadwallader Jones created a company known as the Indian Land Guards. The company was later assigned to the 12th South Carolina Infantry. Jones‚Äô company served in several battles: the Peninsula Campaign, the Second Battle of Bull Run, Antietam, and at the Siege of Petersburg. Only 19 Catawba Indians are known to have enrolled in the Confederacy: * Jefferson Ayers * John Brown * Frank Canty * William Canty * Robert/Bob Crawford * Billy George * Gilbert George * Nelson George * Allen Harris * Epps Harris * Jim Harris * John Harris * Peter Harris, Jr. * Robert/Bob Head * James Kegg * Robert Marsh * John Sanders * John Scott * Alexander Timms. 5th South Carolina Infantry The Catawbas served in Company G. Only three were known to be enrolled: Robert/Bob Crawford, Peter Harris, and Robert/Bob Head. 12th South Carolina Infantry In the 12th, the Catawbas had the most enrollments of Indians. 17th South Carolina Infantry The Catawbas served in the Lacy Guards, Company K. The 17th was part of the Army of Northern Virginia. Organization The Catawba did not create a unit of their own but enrolled in Captain Lucian P.

In 1900, the Catawba was honored by a monument for their service during the American Civil War. One son whose father was in the 12th South Carolina Infantry gave a speech. The Yorkville Enquirer reported the following: \\"For the fourth time in the history of Fort Mill, the citizens have assembled for the purpose of unveiling a monument.

Biography  Little is known of the early life of Cao Futian but he was born during the 19th century, in Jinghai, Zhili province, China. Before the uprising, Cao had been a soldier, considered a bandit \\"known for his brutality\\" by some sources. He raised a militia in TiƒÅnjƒ´n, formed in its majority by illiterate people such as laid-off railway workers, Chinese religious fanatics, criminals and unemployed youth. He was a master of Kung Fu and a charismatic leader. Cao hated foreigners because of the establishment of the foreign concessions, but even more because of the spread of Christianity by missionaries. He thought Chinese Christians should be expelled for tainting the purity of the Chinese culture. First hostile to the Chinese Imperial Army, he fought them in August 1899. The Qing government was divided as to how to react to the Boxers‚Äô activities, but conservative element of the court were in favour of them. Prince Duan, a fervent supporter of the cause, arranged a meeting between Cao and Empress Dowager Ci Xi. At the meeting, the crown prince even wore a Boxer uniform to show alliance. In 1900, he set his headquarters at 18 Hejia Lane, Ruyyi'an Street of Hongqiao District, TiƒÅnjƒ´n, at an old temple venerating L√º Dongbin, which is now the Boxer Museum, Memorial Hall of the Boxer Uprising (Lu Zu Tang).

Crassus Frugi came from an old consular Republican family. He could also trace his ancestry to the triumvir Marcus Licinius Crassus, and through an adoption of one of the triumvir's descendants was also a member of the gens Calpurnii; his ancestors included a number of men who had been consuls.

After Nerva's death and Trajan's ascension to the throne, Crassus and his wife were recalled from exile, but he still proved himself treacherous, and Trajan exiled him again, this time to an island off the coast of Italy.

December 2016 Kai turns his attention to Beverly, who was sent to a psychiatric rehabilitation center thirty days earlier for attacking a teenager after being humiliated in her live broadcasts by male hecklers.

To convince the reporter, Kai and the Wiltons murder Serena and her cameraman Cole. Beverly confronts them at his house, but she declares her allegiance to Kai's cult afterwards as well as R.J., allowing the reporter to republish her live broadcast on Vinny's murder. November 2016 On Election night, Ivy handcuffs Gary in the grocery's basement with the help of Winter after he groped her during the Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton presidential rally earlier that day. Ivy's retaliation costs Gary his chance to vote in the election. Upon discovering his sister's involvement with Ivy, Kai finds Gary in the basement and offers him a hacksaw to sever his chained hand, leading to the events at the beginning of the episode. Reception \\"11/9\\" was watched by 2.13 million people during its original broadcast, and gained a 1.1 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49. The episode has been critically acclaimed. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, \\"11/9\\" holds a 100% approval rating, based on 16 reviews with an average rating of 8.19 out of 10. Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode a 4 out of 5, saying \\"The episode may not be enough to convert new fans to American Horror Story: Cult, but to those preaching to the choir, the Kool-Aid is refreshing.\\" He particularly praised the presence and the development of Peters' Kai Anderson; but also Lourd's performance as Winter, describing her as a \\"master mind manipulator\\". Kat Rosenfield from Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+, and appreciated that it was a break from the character of Ally and her \\"hysterical screaming breakdowns\\".

Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a 8.3 out of 10, with a positive review. He said \\"[this episode] revealed crucial backstory and a fun twist that could greatly alter the story going forward. It was staged nicely, separated into three acts‚Äîwith the third providing a new element that helps add texture to the entire season. It was also fun to watch the \\"cult\\" of Cult actually form, and to see some of the side characters be real(ish) people outside of the facade they put on for the sake of Ally and Ivy.\\" References External links * American Horror Story: Cult episodes ","title":"11/9 (American Horror Story)"},{"id":"55100822","title":"1995‚Äì96 Torneo Argentino A"},{"id":"55100831","text":"David Starkey (born June 28, 1962) is an American poet and academic, and the former poet laureate of Santa Barbara, California. Early life David Starkey was born in Sacramento, California, in 1962 to Frank and Margaret Starkey. He lives in Santa Barbara, California with his wife, Sandy. He was educated at the University of California, Davis (BA, 1984); the University of California, Los Angeles (MA, 1986); and Louisiana State University (MFA, 1990). Career Starkey is a professor of English at Santa Barbara City College, where he directs the creative writing program. Prior to teaching at SBCC, he was an assistant professor at Francis Marion University and associate professor at North Central College. He was a Fulbright-Hays Scholar in India in 1994 and a Senior Fulbright Scholar at the University of Oulu, Finland in 1999. Starkey has published more than 500 poems in literary magazines and has authored eight books of poetry, authored or co-authored five textbooks, and edited or co-edited six anthologies. He is also a book reviewer for the Santa Barbara Independent. He served as Santa Barbara's third poet laureate, from 2009-2011, has been featured on Garrison Keillor‚Äôs The Writer‚Äôs Almanac, and is the publisher and co-editor of Gunpowder Press, a Santa Barbara-based small press that specializes in the publication of poetry. Writing in The Georgia Review, Paul Zimmer praised Starkey‚Äôs ‚Äúwonderful language‚Äù and ‚Äúamazing lines,‚Äù concluding, ‚ÄúStarkey is an entertaining and resourceful poet.‚Äù Of Like a Soprano, Starkey's poetry collection based on The Sopranos TV series, cast member Michael Imperioli, who played Christopher Moltisanti, called the ‚Äúepisode by episode distillation of the series‚Ä¶potent, loving and inspired.‚Äù Critic Arthur Kayzakian noted in Poetry International that the book ‚Äúnever misses a dark heartbeat‚Äù allowing the reader ‚Äúto delve deeper into the psyche of Tony Soprano.‚Äù Reviewing Living Blue in the Red States, an anthology of essays exploring the divide between the red states and blue states, Andy Fogle wrote in PopMatters that the book ‚Äúreveals the sensitivity, openness, and respect which the best (blue or red) minds can offer. I think that there are at least a couple of essays that strident Republicans would appreciate and, perhaps more importantly, those same essays might teach some Democrats a thing or two about temperance and true tolerance.‚Äù Booklist noted that Living Blue in the Red States contributors display ‚Äúpassion for their regions and elegance in expressing their anger, frustration, and longing to close‚Äîor at least understand‚Äîthe political divide.‚Äù Perhaps best known for his popular textbook Creative Writing: Four Genres in Brief,http://www.bu.edu/wpnet/files/2010/09/Hesse-Creative-Writing- Composition-CCC-2010.pdf Starkey's pedagogy is based on collaborations with the late Wendy Bishop, which focused on employing composition studies to aid in the teaching of creative writing. In an article in College Composition and Communication entitled ‚ÄúThe Place of Composition in Creative Writing Studies,‚Äù Doug Hesse identifies Starkey as a writer-teacher working ‚Äúat the fringe of both fields‚Äîperhaps tolerantly or even compellingly so.‚Äù Bibliography Poetry * Open Mike Night at the Cabaret Voltaire (1996) * Ways of Being Dead (2006) * Adventures of the Minor Poet (2007) * Starkey's Book of States (2008) * A Few Things You Should Know About the Weasel (2010) * It Must Be Like the World (2011) * Circus Maximus (2013) * Like a Soprano (2014) Textbooks * Poetry Writing: Theme and Variations (1999) * Keywords in Creative Writing (2006), with Wendy Bishop * Creative Writing: An Introduction to Poetry and Fiction (2013) * Academic Writing Now: A Brief Guide for Busy Students (2015) * Creative Writing: Four Genres in Brief (2008; 2013; 2017) Anthologies * Teaching Writing Creatively (1998) * Smokestacks and Skyscrapers (1999), with Richard Guzman * In Praise of Pedagogy (2000), with Wendy Bishop * Genre by Example: Writing What We Teach (2001) * In a Fine Frenzy: Poets Respond to Shakespeare (2005), with Paul Willis * Living Blue in the Red States (2007)  References  1962 births Living people Writers from Sacramento, California Poets from California 21st-century American poets American male poets Writers from Santa Barbara, California Louisiana State University alumni University of California, Los Angeles alumni University of California, Davis alumni North Central College faculty Fulbright Scholars 21st-century American male writers ","title":"David Starkey (poet)"},{"id":"55100853","text":"Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (CCCC) is an NCI-designated Cancer Center in Cleveland, Ohio affiliated with Case Western Reserve University.

He became an apprentice to his father's brother Andrew Drummond, a London banker. Henry Drummond handled a large amount of American business, and acted as financial agent for New Jersey in 1763. In 1759 he became army agent for the 42nd Foot and 46th Foot which were commanded by Murray relatives. By 1761 he was agent for the 87th Regiment commanded by Robert Murray Keith and the 89th Regiment commanded by Staats Long Morris. In 1765 he went into partnership with Richard Cox, and by 1771 the firm had 18 regiments on their books. Drummond married Elizabeth Compton, daughter of Hon. Charles Compton on 21 March 1761. In 1770 he took over from his cousin John Drummond as partner of Thomas Harley in the contract for army remittances to North America. John Drummond's health failed in 1772, and Robert Drummond persuaded Henry to give up his army agency business and return to the bank as third partner. Henry Drummond was a member of a social group, known as ‚ÄòThe Gang‚Äô, which included Anthony Chamier, Lord Frederick Campbell, William Amherst, Sir John Sebright, Thomas Bradshaw, Rigby, Thomas Harley, and R.

Name The Walmbaria presently represent themselves as Dingaal, and in land claims the Walmbaar Aboriginal Corporation defines the Dingaal they represent as adult people of the Dingaal clan or people or community having a Dingaal patrilineal descent, or who were adopted by such a person, A Dingaal father is someone who descends on their father's side from any of the Baru, Yoren or Charlies families. Language The Walmbaria name for their language was, according to Norman Tindale, Yalgawara, which was spoken in two dialect versions, one for the mainland branch, the other for the islanders. Morer recent work has preferred the term Gambilmugu. Country The Walmbaria's traditional lands are estimated to have encompassed approximately , extending over the reefs and Flinders island group north of Princess Charlotte Bay. Their southern limits were between a site called Alumukuan in Bathurst Bay and the eastern extremity of Charlotte Bay. People and social organisation The Walmbaria were divided into two main clans: * The Wureimnu were principally islanders * The Tartali. (Bathurst Head) Their marriage laws were, by the time late ethnographers explored them, based on a two class system, consisting of: * (A) Owaimini * (B) Ungawu. Tindale in his later report states that the Walmbaria were essentially islanders who only came over to the continental mainland, at Bathurst Head and Cape Melville. \\"on sufferance.\\" The ritual extraction of a tooth (tooth avulsion) was practiced on both sexes, with the removal of either the right or left upper incisor. History The Walmbaria used to be \\"recruited\\" for work on luggers that worked the maritime resources of this area. Some Flinders island men were involved in \\"the Wild Duck massacre\\" in which 4 European sailors were killed. Though the tribes are not named, one report from a crew member with Captain Blackwood who landed at a spot just south of Cape Melville in 1843 has provided a linguistic clue. He stated that several Aborigines there were surprised by the captain's dog, and yelling: angooa. This word was taken to mean \\"dog\\", but analysis suggests that it was a form of a Barrow Point noun angwurr (\\"dog's bark\\"), and a Flinders Island verb nganggwoyi (\\"to bark.\\") The logical surmise is that the Flinders and Barrow Point peoples shared the same areas. By 1926 a survey found that the Walmbaria remnant which had managed to survive the incursions of white settlement numbered a mere 25, 10 of them male, the rest female, with no children known to exist, the youngest person encountered being 18 years old. The last survivor of Flinders Island language- speaking Aba Agathi clan was Chinaman Gilbert. Material culture The Flinders island Walmbaria and Bathurst Head women used two kinds of mallet for pulping food and breaking oyster shells. Their men manufactured a heavier and thicker ironwood mallet than the otun, similar to the drum gong used in Melanesia, though they also used the normal regional variety employed to this end by the Barungguan and Mutumui.

In 1932, the diesel engine business became a separate company named the Newbury Diesel Company. The Plenty name is now owned by SPX FLOW. Takeovers Around 1970, Plenty and Son was acquired by Booker McConnell and, by 1977, it had become part of the Booker Group's fluid engineering division, supplying pumps and related equipment to the oil industry. In 2001, Plenty was acquired by SPX FLOW. There are now (August 2017) three divisions: Plenty Filters in Newbury, Plenty Mixers in Manchester and Plenty Pumps in Glasgow.

He is president of the architectural firm Kohn Pedersen Fox (KPF). He is known for his contributions to the designs of new cities, urban mixed-use clusters, and supertall buildings, including the Lotte World Tower, currently the world's fifth tallest building, and One Vanderbilt, currently under construction next to Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan. He also played a primary role in establishing KPF's practice in Asia in the early 1990s.  Early life  von Klemperer was born in 1957 in Northampton, Massachusetts, to Klemens von Klemperer (Historian) and Elizabeth von Klemperer (Literary Scholar). He attended Phillips Academy Andover and the Perse School in Cambridge, England. He received his Bachelor of Arts, magna cum laude, from Harvard University in 1979, majoring in history and literature. His thesis focused on the novels of Louis-Ferdinand C√©line. Von Klemperer was awarded the Charles Henry Fiske Scholarship from Harvard, sending him to Trinity College at the University of Cambridge, where he began his architecture studies under Peter Carl. In 1983, he completed his master's in architecture, cum laude, from Princeton University, where he studied under Rafael Moneo, and was the recipient of the Butler Traveling Fellowship.  Architectural career  In his 35-year career, von Klemperer has designed buildings in the United States, Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. He trained at KPF under the firm's founders, Bill Pedersen and Gene Kohn, and senior Principal Bill Louie. In the area of city planning, he led the design of New Songdo City in Korea, Meixi Lake in the Hunan province of China, and the Boston Seaport. Songdo is a 1,500 acre mixed- use community that received the first Green City award from the Urban Land Institute in 2004. One of the building types on which von Klemperer as focused, and for which KPF is best known, is the mixed-use, high rise urban cluster. Examples include Jing An Kerry Centre, which was recognized by ULI in 2015 with its Global Award for Excellence, and Plaza 66 in Shanghai, KPF's first major China project, which he undertook in partnership with Princeton classmate and fellow KPF Principal Paul Katz. von Klemperer has designed several of the world's tallest buildings, including the 555-meter Lotte World Tower, working with KPF Principal Trent Tesch, and the rising, 435-meter One Vanderbilt Tower, which will be the tallest office building in Midtown Manhattan. In contrast with such large projects, von Klemperer has also focused on the design of smaller scale institutional and educational architecture. Examples are the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, D.C. (completed 1999, AIA Award 2001), the Chadwick School in Incheon, Korea (completed 2008), the NYU Nursing and Dental building in New York (completed 2016), and the Peking University School of Transnational Law in Shenzhen (completed 2017).  Academic and public service  In addition to his professional work, von Klemperer has taught at the Yale University School of Architecture as the Eero Saarinen Professor (2012, 2016). He has also lectured at many universities including Harvard, Columbia, √âcole Speciale d'Architecture, Tsing Hua, Tongji, Seoul National University, and Tokyo University. He is a frequent lecturer at the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, the NYAIA Center for Architecture, the Asia Society in New York and Hong Kong, and the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in London. Like his designs, much of his academic work explores the potential for incorporating inclusive public space in dense urban structures. This agenda translates to his pro-bono design for the redevelopment of the Gamashie neighborhood in Accra, Ghana. He also serves on the boards of various educational and cultural institutions, including the Storefront for Art and Architecture and Bard College, and is the President of the Board for both the Skyscraper Museum and the Urban Design Forum. James von Klemperer was made a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 2006. He is also a member of the RIBA. In 2018, he was awarded the American Prize for Architecture, also known as the Louis H. Sullivan Award, from the Chicago Athenaeum.https://chi- athenaeum.org/essays-page/2018/06/14/american-prize-for-architecture-2018/ References Harvard University alumni 1957 births Living people American architects Princeton University School of Architecture alumni Phillips Academy alumni ","title":"James von Klemperer"},{"id":"55101610","text":"The Jolly Mountain fire was a wildfire in Wenatchee National Forest, Kittitas County, Washington, that began with lightning strikes August 11, 2017 and burned for over three months.

For International Primate Day September 1, Moby Teams Up With ADI To ‚ÄòBack The Macaque‚Äô And Help Endangered Primates. September 1, 2016  Overview of primates  Primates are a very large family of about 200 species, include monkeys, bonobos, lemurs, orangutans, et al. Statements on great apes which focus largely or entirely on apes would not include all primates.  Significance of primate advocacy  The release of apes from biomedical laboratories started in Europe and Japan about fifteen years before that movement emerged in North America. Developments in Europe During the past several decades of primate advocacy, the Great Ape Project has emerged, and movements in Europe have seen calls for extended legal protections to Great Apes, the higher primates. Developments in Japan See Japanese macaque Developments in the United States Withdrawal of financial support by NIH in the United States A study commissioned by the National Institute of Health (NIH) and conducted by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) concluded in a report (see report brief) released on December 15, 2011 that ‚Äòwhile the chimpanzee has been a valuable animal model in past research, most current use of chimpanzees for biomedical research is unnecessary‚Äô. The primary recommendation is that the use of chimpanzees in research be guided by a set of principles and criteria, in effect to greatly limit government-funded research using chimpanzees. Falling short of calling for the out-right ban of using chimpanzees for research, the report acknowledged that new emerging, or re-emerging diseases may require the use of chimpanzees, echoing Professor Colin Blakemore‚Äôs concern. Francis Collins, Director of NIH announced on the same day the report was released that he accepted the recommendations and will develop the implementation plan which includes the forming of an expert committee to review all submitted grant applications and projects already underway involving the use of chimpanzees. Furthermore, no new grant applications using chimpanzees will be reviewed until further notice. On 21 September 2012, NIH announced that 110 chimpanzees owned by the government will be retired. NIH owns about 500 chimpanzees for research, this move signifies the first step to wind down NIH‚Äôs investment in chimpanzee research, according to Francis Collins. Currently housed at the New Iberia Research Center in Louisiana, ten of the retired chimpanzees were to be transferred to the chimpanzee sanctuary Chimp Haven, while the rest were to go to Texas Biomedical Research Institute in San Antonio. However, concerns over the chimpanzee‚Äôs status in the Texas Biomedical Research Institute as ‚Äòresearch ineligible‚Äô rather than ‚Äòretired‚Äô prompted NIH to reconsider the plan; it announced on 17 October 2012 that as many chimpanzees as possible would be relocated to Chimp Haven by August 2013, and that eventually all 110 would be moved there. On 22 January 2013, a NIH task force released a report calling for the government to retire most of the chimpanzees the U.S. government support. The panel concluded that the animals provide little benefit in biomedical discoveries except in a few disease cases which can be supported by a small population of 50 primates for future research. Other approaches such as genetically altered mice should be developed and refined. On 13 November 2013, the US Congress and Senate passed ‚ÄòThe Chimpanzee Health Improvement, Maintenance and Protection Act‚Äô, approving the funding to expand the capacity of Chimp Haven and other chimpanzee sanctuaries, thus allowing the transfer of almost all of the apes owned by the federal government to live in a more natural and group environment than in the laboratory. The transfer is expected to take five years when all but 50 chimpanzees, which will remain with the NIH, will be ‚Äòretired‚Äô. Declaration on Great Apes The Great Ape Project is campaigning to have the United Nations endorse a Declaration on Great Apes.Declaration on Great Apes , Great Ape Project This would extend what the project calls the \\"community of equals\\" to include chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and orangutans. The declaration seeks to extend to non-human great apes the protection of three basic interests: the right to life, the protection of individual liberty, and the prohibition of torture. Right to life The declaration states that members of the community of equals, which includes humans, may not be killed except in certain strictly defined circumstances such as self-defense. Protection of individual liberty The declaration states that members of the community of equals are not to be deprived of their liberty, and are entitled to immediate release where there has been no form of due process. Under the proposed declaration, the detention of great apes who have not been convicted of any crime or who are not criminally liable should be permitted only where it can be shown that the detention is in their own interests or is necessary to protect the public. The declaration says there must be a right of appeal, either directly or through an advocate, to a judicial tribunal. Prohibition of torture The declaration prohibits the torture, defined as the deliberate infliction of severe pain, on any great ape, whether wantonly or because of a perceived benefit to others. Under International Human Rights Law this is a jus cogens principle and under all major human rights documents it cannot at any time be derogated by any State. Criticism At present, the Declaration on Great Apes is not generally supported by all primatologists. Several organizations, including GRASP, the Great Apes Survival Project, are more concerned with apes in the wild than with legal issues surrounding the relatively few apes in captivity.

He was educated at Edinburgh High School and Edinburgh University. At university he formed a group with James Finlayson and George Husband Baird, for extra-curricular linguistic researches. He took notes on Dugald Stewart's course of 1778‚Äì9. After graduating, Walker spent seven years in Edinburgh as a tutor. He joined the Speculative Society in 1783. In 1787 he took the position as tutor to the Marquess of Tullibardine, eldest son of John Murray, 4th Duke of Atholl, and accompanied him to Eton College. From 1796, Walker was a customs officer in Perth. When the Perth Courier, a Tory newspaper, was set up in 1808, Walker became its editor. He was also involved in the compilation of the Encyclopaedia Perthensis. In 1809 he was vice- president of the Literary and Antiquarian Society of Perth. Walker's biography of Burns. \\"Miscellaneous Remarks on the Writings of Burns\\", was published in an 1811 edition of the poems, Poems by Robert Burns with an Account of his Life. It was then printed separately. Walker had first met Burns at the Edinburgh house of Thomas Blacklock. They had another encounter at Blair Atholl, and Walker had known Burns in Dumfriesshire, without being a close friend.

Since 2002, she has held the position of Canada Research Chair in Deep Ocean Research. Her research on hydrothermal systems helped establish Canada's first Endeavor Hot Vents Marine Protected Area. Her research has also lead to the discovery of over 80 new species of marine life. Early life Verena Tunnicliffe grew up in the center of Ontario. Her fascination with ocean started at a young age, though she never glimpsed the sea until she was nineteen. It was her mother who introduced her, at age seven, to the ocean. A small wooden box encrusted with seashells, brought back to her from Florida was all it took to begin a lifelong obsession with the sea. Tunnicliffe decided then to become a marine biologist and dedicate her time to learning the name and origin of all the creatures that created those shells. The early 80‚Äôs proved fruitful for the young doctor. Intending only to do a little research, Dr. Tunnicliffe instead became the first woman on the West Coast to lead deep-sea research expeditions from Vancouver Island. She only meant to stay in British Columbia for two years, but by 1983 Dr. Tunnicliffe helped to discover hydrothermal vent systems off the coast, explored previously unknown sections of the deep sea, and was part of the discovery of over 80 new marine species. Career Tunnicliffe has been a professor at the University of Victoria in the Departments of Biology and School of Earth and Ocean Sciences for years. She is a marine biologist who holds a Canada Research Chair in Deep Ocean Research. As a research chair, her work mainly focuses on the use of submersibles and deep sea observatories to research and discover deep sea ecosystems and hydrothermal vents located on the Pacific Coast. Her lab has been working for over 30 years on animals that live near hydrothermal vents in the Pacific Ocean, mainly focusing work in the Juan de Fuca Plate. Her research on hydrothermal systems helped establish Canada's first Endeavor Hot Vents Marine Protected Area. In her career thus far, she has discovered 80 new species of life including 9 that are named after her. Tunnicliffe is also a member of the Canadian Scientific Submersible Faculty where the group raised funds to run and operate the ROPOS, a submarine that is remote-controlled that can go a depth of 3 miles. She also donated over 10 years of service, in 2012, as the Director of the cabled subsea observing network, VENUS (changed to Ocean Networks Canada). Tunnicliffe is a collaborator with the Canadian Healthy Ocean Strategic Network who works in collaboration with Fisheries and Oceans Canada. Her main work as a collaborator is discovering ways to conserve the Canadian marine ecosystems. Personal life Much of Tunnicliffe's personal life revolves around her career. Both her parents had a strong influence on her interest in science. Her father was a nuclear physicist at Chalk River in Ontario, Canada.. He treated Verena and her older brother as equals, making sure they knew skills such as constructing a telescope and tinkering with electronics. Although her father was hesitant to employ women, due to the views of society at the time, he encouraged Verena to pursue her interests. Turncliffe is married John Garrett, a marine policy consultant, and has a child, Arielle, now 26. Verena told her daughter to \\"follow her passion\\" and to \\"address your own happiness and health\\". Her daughter was pursuing a PhD in science in 2014.

Voters chose eight representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Kansas was won by Columbia University President Dwight D. Eisenhower (R‚ÄìNew York), running with Senator Richard Nixon, with 68.77% of the popular vote, against Adlai Stevenson (D‚ÄìIllinois), running with Senator John Sparkman, with 30.50% of the popular vote. Kansas is reliably Republican, with the party's nominee losing the state only three times since 1920. That fact, combined with Eisenhower's boyhood home of Abilene, the seat of Dickinson County, made the results from the Sunflower State among the least surprising of the 1952 election.

This Americanized surname was derived from the German surname Willeit or Wilheit, which is a variant form of Willeitner. The Wilhoite name can trace its origin back to the northern part of the German state of Bavaria. Willeitner, is a habitational name from a more recent adaptation of the place named Weillitnen in northern Bavaria. Willeit is probably a toponymic name from Middle High German wil ‚Äòsmall settlement‚Äô + leite ‚Äòslope‚Äô. The origins of toponymic by-names have been attributed to two non-mutually exclusive trends. One was to link the nobility to their places of origin and their feudal holdings and provide a marker of their status, while the other relates to the growth of the burgher class in the cities, partly via migration from the countryside. History German Wilhoite families migrated from Germany and arrived in the America during the early c.1700s. Most Germans came to the United States seeking economic opportunities or religious and political freedom. Even so, Wilhoites most likely migrated due to religious prosecution; most German immigration to the United States during 1638-1820 was caused by religious persecutions following from the changes wrought by the Thirty Years' War, and also by economic hardship. Wilhoites also began to emigrate to England in the 18th century. Most of the Germans who migrated to the US with the Wilhoite (Wilheit) surname ultimately settled in Tennessee. These people were referred to as The 2nd Germanna Colony - German families, whose members arrived in Virginia in 1717, from villages around the Kraichgau area of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany.

In 2017, she stood for election in Coventry South, receiving 1.3% of the votes. In 2018, her father, who had been serving as her election agent, was convicted and jailed for sexual offences against a child, leading to Challenor's suspension from the party during an investigation. She later resigned and joined the Liberal Democrats, but was suspended from that party in 2019. Personal life Although assigned male at birth, Knight says she realised she was a girl around the age of 10, but her parents were unaware of the existence of trans people. Knight and her two siblings were taken into care in 2013. Knight came out as trans in 2014; she tells of experiencing anxiety and depression as well as online harassment. As a child, Knight was diagnosed with autism and oppositional defiant disorder. She was educated at Lewis Charlton Learning Centre, an independent special school for children with emotional and behavioural difficulties. Challenor then attended Henley College Coventry, where she was the college's National Union of Students (NUS) lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) officer. Challenor lives with her mother in Coventry and is studying for a B.A. in philosophy, politics and economics at the Open University. During 2019, Knight went through the process of changing her legal gender through the Gender Recognition Act 2004 and the British Government issued a new Birth Certificate recognising Challenor as female. , Challenor was engaged to Nathaniel Knight, who lives in the United States. They married in December 2019. Political career Knight joined the Green Party of England and Wales in November 2014. She was the chair of LGBTIQA+ Greens (LGBT, plus intersex, queer, asexual, and other) between 2015 and 2017. Challenor became the party's equality spokesperson in 2016. According to the Green Party, Knight was the only trans spokesperson for a UK political party. In April 2017, Knight helped co-found the Global Greens LGBT+ Network alongside colleagues from Die Gr√ºnen, Groen, Taiwan Tree Party, and Taiwan Green Party.https://www.globalgreens.org/sites/globalgreens.org/files/Advancing%20LGBT%2B%20Rights%20%28after%20CAS%20workshop%29%20FINAL%20BEFORE%20PLENARY%20APRIL%202.pdf In July 2017, Knight was the Green candidate for Coventry South. She received 1.3% of the vote share, with 604 votes. Knight stood for Coventry City Council elections as a member of the Green Party in February 2016 and May 2016. She stood in a May 2018 local election. She was not elected. Knight stood in the 2018 party election to be deputy leader, which closed at the end of August. In August 2018, Knight's father David Challenor was sentenced to 22 years in prison for raping and torturing a 10-year-old girl in the attic of the home shared by him, Aimee and Tina Challenor (his wife and her mother). Knights's father had been reported to the police in 2015 and charged in November 2016. Following this, Knight chose her father as her election agent for the 2017 general election and also the 2018 council elections. Knight had given her father's name as \\"Baloo Challenor\\" on campaign materials, later commenting that he was known locally by this nickname. After her father's sentencing, Knight ‚Äì who insisted she did not know the allegations against her father in full ‚Äì stood down from the Green Party's deputy leadership election. Knight was consequently suspended from the party on a no-fault basis, and the party launched an inquest into possible safeguarding failures as David was allowed to act as Aimee's election agent after having been charged. In September 2018, Knight resigned from the Green Party citing transphobia however Knight continued to cooperate with the inquest. The inquest by Verita found in January 2019 that she had committed a \\"serious error of judgement\\" in appointing her father as her campaign manager. The report also said that the Green Party, who were told by Knight that her father had been arrested but not that he was a party member, could have done more to investigate the matter. In October 2018, she joined the Liberal Democrats, becoming the Diversity Officer of her local party. She was suspended from the Liberal Democrats in July 2019, after tweets appeared on her partner's account admitting to having sexual fantasies involving sex with children. Knight said that her partner's account had been hacked. LGBT activism In 2015, Knight was the LGBTQ Officer for Henley College Coventry; she protested the college's censoring of websites such as Birmingham Pride, which were considered \\"Gay or Lesbian or Bisexual Interest\\" by the college web blocker. Knight was an organiser of Coventry Pride in 2016 and 2017. After a Transport for London (TfL) helpline employee told Knight that she \\"didn't sound like a Miss\\", she successfully campaigned to get TfL to investigate the incident and to use gender-neutral language in announcements, avoiding phrases such as \\"ladies and gentlemen\\". In May 2018, the BBC published an article that quoted writer Miranda Yardley describing Knight as a \\"man\\". Knight said that the BBC did not contact her about the article before its publication, though following readers' complaints she was asked to comment, and her response was added to the article. Knight was a member of the Trans Advisory Group for Stonewall, Britain's largest LGBT charity. She resigned in the summer of 2019 stating there was a \\"hostile environment towards trans people in the UK\\" and that she was concerned for her mental health and safety.

By contrast with the settlement areas of the North Sea, Oder-Vistula and Rhine-Weser Germanii (from which the Franks descended), there was a relatively uniform development in the economic and social spheres. This can be seen, for example, in the clear consistencies of material and intellectual culture (ceramics, appliances, weapons, jewellery, religious customs, etc.). This was due to the intensive contact between the Elbe Germanic tribes, as well as contact with other, more distant, Germanic tribes. Links with the Jastorf culture have been made. Based on the Roman sources, this cultural area was briefly united under Maroboduus (c. 30 BC -- AD 37), a Romanized king of the Germanic Suebi.  History of research  Elbe Germanic disc fibula from Schwanbeck, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany The term 'Elbe Germanic' (German: Elbgermanen) was first used in 1868 by Paul Gustav Wislicenus (1847-1917), but it was especially popularized by the German prehistorian :de:Walther Matthes in 1931.Johannes Hoops, Heinrich Beck, Dieter Geuenich, Heiko Steuer: Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde: Band 7; Walter de Gruyter, Berlin/New York 1989, The term was based initially on partially speculative derivations from ancient Roman sources. For example, numerous Roman authors mentioned the tribes such as the Suebi and the Irminones, and some other Germanic tribes of the late antiquity on the Danube limes of the Roman Empire. In the second half of the 20th century, more archeological evidence has emerged. In 1963, the Czech archaeologist Bed≈ôich Svoboda took up the term and postulated an Elbe Germanic connection with the finds in Bohemia and Bavaria, which was later confirmed.Thomas S. Burns: Barbarians within the gates of Rome: a study of Roman military policy and the barbarians, ca. 375-425 A.D, Indiana University Press, Bloomington 1994, Archaeological finds make it possible to differentiate between the different settlement areas of the Elbe Germanic tribes. There is a northern group around the mouth of the Elbe and in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, a middle group in central Germany that reaches as far as the Oder, and a southern group in Bohemia, an area that was entirely Elbe- Germanic during the time of the Roman Empire. Based on the linguistic and archaeological evidence, it is believed that the major Germanic tribes of the Alemanni, Thuringii, and the Bavarii mainly developed from the smaller Suebic groups that were part of the Elbe Germanic peoples.Heinrich Beck: Germanenprobleme in heutiger Sicht; Walter de Gruyter, Berlin/New York, 1999,  Elbe Germanic protolanguage  \\"Elbe Germanic\\", also called Irminonic, is a term introduced by the German linguist Friedrich Maurer in his 1942 book, Nordgermanen und Alemanen, to describe the unattested proto-language, or dialectal grouping, ancestral to the later Alemannic, Lombardic, Thuringian and Bavarian dialects.

The song was released in August of the same year as the B-side of the single \\"Home of the Blues\\" (Sun 279), which reached No. 3 in the Country Jockey charts and No. 5 in the Country & Western Chart. \\"Give My Love To Rose\\" reached No. 13 in the Country & Western Chart.Whitburn, Joel, The Billboard Book Of Top 40 Country Hits. 1944 - 2006, New York, N.Y., Billboard Books, 2006, p.74 Cash recorded the song several times. For his 2002 version he received his fourth and final Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance. Background Cash said a prisoner from San Quentin State Prison asked him to take a message to his wife if he ever went through his hometown. This conversation, according to Cash, was the inspiration for the lyric, which is about a dying convict who is released after ten years of imprisonment. The prisoner is on his way to Louisiana from San Francisco to see his wife and his child one last time before he dies. He collapses along the rails of the railway, where he is picked up by a stranger. The convict asks the man to take his wife his love and a little money. The man agrees. Cash recorded the song at Sun Records in his usual manner, playing the rhythm guitar himself, with Luther Perkins and Marshall Grant on the lead guitar and bass respectively. The song was the last one which Sam Phillips supervised as a producer. Producing duties then passed to \\"Cowboy\\" Jack Clement. An alternative take, with choruses in the background, was rejected by the label. Releases Cash recorded the song several times over the course of his career. It appears on the 1960 album Johnny Cash Sings Hank Williams, even though the song is not one of Williams'. It also appears on the album All Aboard the Blue Train with Johnny Cash, released in 1962. He also included the song on the following albums: *I Walk the Line (1964) *At Folsom Prison (1968) *American IV: The Man Comes Around (2002) In April 1999 Bruce Springsteen played a solo acoustic version of the song, for the television show An All Star Tribute to Johnny Cash.

These women face difficulties in their work environment as a result of a largely male dominated positions of power within the medical field as well as initial biases presented in the hiring process, but not limited to promotions. Men who are nurses are often subjected to stereotypic treatment as a result of being in a largely female dominated field. These stereotypes include patients assuming sexual orientation, job title, or not feeling comfortable with a male nurse. Sexism has had a long-standing history within the medical industry. Gender roles According to a study done in 2003, the numbers of women in medicine have increased significantly. This trend continues into today. Gender difference have been found in the motivations for applying to medical school. Studies suggest that \\"male applicants are more motivated by financial, prestige, scientific and technical issues, whereas female applicants stress more \\"person orientated humanistic and altruistic reasons.\\" Gender differences have also been found in \\"attitudes toward health promotion.\\" In addition, male and female clinicians are likely to use different styles of communication. Male doctors were found to be more likely to \\"speak in an authoritative manner, give direct commands to patients, interrupt more, are perceived as more imposing and presumptuous, spend less time with patients, make fewer positive statements and smile and nod less.‚Äù Some studies have found that female doctors ‚Äúprovide more intensive therapeutic milieu that could lead to more open exchange and comprehensive diagnosis and treatment.‚Äù In addition, females have been found to take more precautionary measures and give more tests than men are. There is also a connection between gender roles in the medical field and family pressures. A study was done to determine how doctors combine their working lives with having a normal family life. This study analyzed three different strategies used by men and women in order to cope with managing a normal family life and a work-heavy career. The three different types of strategies that men and women use are ‚Äúcareer dominant, segregated, and accommodated.‚Äù When it comes to the career dominant strategy, about 15c of women and 3% of men adopt this strategy. This strategy ‚Äúimplies a continuous, full time career and a reduced family life- living single or divorced and childless as a consequence of the career.‚Äù The segregated strategy is composed of 55% of women and 85% of men, and it ‚Äúimplies a continuous, full time career with family roles organized so as to enable more time to be devoted to the career.‚Äù And lastly, the accommodating strategy is adopted by 30% of women and 12% of men. This strategy ‚Äúimplies that work involvement has been reduced in some way to allow more time for family roles.‚Äù As can be seen by these statistics, men are more likely than women to devote more time to their job as opposed to their family. A 2019 study found that female doctors suffer from higher rates of burnout, while 73% of respondents said gender discrimination \\"has diminished their morale and career satisfaction\\".  Obstetrics and gynecology  In 2018, 59% of gynecologists were women, yet there still is a pay gap based on gender in this specialty. Female obstetrician-gynecologists face barriers in advancing into leadership positions and earn around $36,000 less a year than their male counterpart. Although sexism in the medical field has often been associated with women, discrimination has been noted by male populations of obstetricians-gynecologists. Male obstetricians-gynecologists can be negatively impacted by a patient's desire to have a female clinician for a woman's health care needs. Due to socially prescribed roles for men and women, men are often discouraged from entering this specialty and can receive judgement based on unconscious or conscious bias. A 2018 study, published in the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, found that women in obstetrics and gynecology faced discrimination based on differences in salary, and men in obstetrics and gynecology faced discrimination based on patient preferences. Medical education Women are underrepresented in leadership positions in academic medicine. Women and men begin their medical careers at similar rates but they do not advance at the same rate. Studies indicate a systematic bias that has resulted in relatively fewer appointments to academic chairs. Thirty- two percent of associate professors at medical schools are women, 32% of associate professors are women, 20% of full professors are women, 14% of department chairs are women, and 11% of deans of medical schools are women. A factor that impedes women's opportunities for advancement in academic medicine is a ‚Äústereotype-based cognitive bias.‚Äù There are two forms of this. The first type is related to clear personal beliefs about women, such as believing that women are less committed to their careers than men and believing that women are worse leaders than men. The second type is implicit bias, which is harder to see because the biases are harder to see, but they still influence one's judgment and actions towards women. Although implicit gender bias still plays a role, explicit bias in academic medicine has significantly decreased during the past half century in the United States as a result of Title IX getting passed. Implicit bias has had little to no improvement. Cultural stereotypes characterize women as ‚Äúcommunal,‚Äù such as kind, dependent, and nurturing, but characterize women as lacking ‚Äúagentic‚Äù traits, such as logical, independent, and strong, which are typically used as a male stereotype. These stereotypes make it difficult for women to achieve in the workforce, specifically in medicine, science, and in leadership. While men are associated with ‚Äúagentic‚Äù traits and women are not, this can lead to women feeling that their work is less valued and they typically receive fewer nominations for opportunities that can advance their career. It has also been found that gender stereotypes play a role in socializing students towards their specialties. For example, women are more likely to go into communal specialties, including family medicine, pediatrics, and internal medicine, while men are more likely to go into surgery, research, and be the chair of a position. If women to go into specialties dominated by males, they typically have lower statuses. Residency is the first time the medical students, or new physicians, get to be in a leadership role. Men who are too communal can be accused of being ‚Äúwimpy‚Äù or ‚Äúsoft‚Äù whereas women who are too agentic can be accused of being ‚Äúbossy‚Äù or ‚Äúdomineering.‚Äù These stereotypes are due to the lack of gender awareness and role models. Female medical students have reported sexual harassment and discrimination. This is of concern because these obstacles affect \\"the professional identity formation and specialty choice.\\" Personality differences exist between male and female surgical students. Fewer women choose to specialize in surgery. The lack of female role models may discourage some from choosing a surgical career. A study by the National Medical Foundation found that 60% of women have reported that gender has had an effect on their educational experience whereas only 25% of males have reported that gender has had an effect on their educational experience. Women said they felt as though they had to be twice as good to be treated equal to men. Additionally, 30.7% of women reported overcoming fear and failure whereas only 19.4% of males reported overcoming fear and failure in education One response to bias against women academics has been to conduct training for faculty and students to recognize bias and change their habits. The study used professional development, counseling psychology, adult learning, and health behavioral change to development a bias-learning training where data showed that gender biases and habits were not permanent and that they could be shaped and changed. There is also a persisting class and race gap that is being ignored by contemporary feminist debate, as the discussion about feminism in the medical profession tends to place \\"too much focus on the opportunities afforded to educated middle class women\\", most of them white. Female clinicians alt= Geneva Medical College, where Elizabeth Blackwell graduated in 1849 While both men and women are enrolling in medical school at similar rates, in 2015 the United States reported having 34% active female physicians and 66% active male physicians. The lower rates of practicing female physicians is associated with their higher rates of experiencing: sexual assault, wage disparities, gender norms, sexism, and medical school sabotage. Sexual Assault According to a Medscape survey, more than 10% of female physicians have experienced workplace sexual assault compared to just 4% of men. Among women who have experienced sexual assault and harassment, 50% stated that this experience negatively impacted their career advancement. Sexual harassment is common amongst younger clinicians when they come in contact with male clinicians in power who have more seniority over them. Due to their sense of power over their coworkers and employees, they feel empowered to commit acts of sexual assault. In many cases, female survivors of sexual assault fail to come forward and report these crimes because they are labeled \\"troublemakers\\" and have a hard time finding new employment. As a result of this, and Human Relations typically functioning to protect the company/hospital rather than the survivor, female physician survivors are unlikely to report their experiences, resulting in future female physicians also remaining silent if abused, thus continue the cyclical cycle of misconduct within the medical system. Wage Gap Besides experiencing greater rates of sexual assault in the workplace, female surgeons are also subject to the wage gap. Females were reported to have lower salaries than male surgeons. In a study conducted in 1990, male clinicians were making a mean earnings of $155,400, while female clinicians were making a mean earnings of $109,900; about $45,500 less than their male counterparts. As of 2016, female physicians have statistically been found to make about $18,677 less than male physicians. Pay disparities for female physicians has also been blamed on women not wanting to commit to leadership roles which pay higher salaries. Besides gender biases, it is also believed that female physicians are paid less because they are more likely to bill their patients less (as they fear their patient will be unable to pay their bill) and are less likely to be aggressive when negotiating their salary and contract. Traditional Gender Norms Traditional gender norms are another barrier female physicians face in the medical field. According to research, having children is a career stopper for female physicians. It is reported that approximately 30% of female physicians have faced discrimination for either being pregnant or needing to breastfeed/pump. Besides this, female physicians are seven times more likely to not work part time when compared to men as their maternity leaves are on average four weeks shorter than what the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends. It was found that the percentage of female clinicians working part-time in either a hospital setting or a general physician's office after having a child is much higher than the percentage of these women working full- time after having a child (92.7%, 96.3% 59.2%, 76.5% respectively). Along with this, female physicians are often paid less because traditional gender norms put child rearing responsibilities on the mother. Patient Sexism Furthermore, female physician narratives have described instances of sexism. Female physicians are often mistaken for nurses by patients. Patients have also been reported to have less trust in their physician if they are female and instead ask for a second opinion from a male physician. Women physicians, on the other hand, have also been found to partake in sexist actions. Female clinicians often treat women patients differently than they do men. Women physicians were found to admit less female patients to intensive care units because they were proactive in treating them in the emergency room, rendering their admittance to more intense care units unnecessary. Medical School Sabotage Female physicians also face gender bias in medical schools. In 2018, Tokyo Medical University lowered the test scores of its female applicants. Since 2006, the university has been subtracting points from the exams of female applicants while adding, on average, 20 points to the exams of male applicants.  Women in leadership positions  Cardiovascular medicine From a broad perspective, women hold a large number of leadership roles in politics and in the workforce than ever in the United States. Yet, the cardiology specialty remains dominated by men, being that in 2015, only 13.2% of cardiologists were women. Surveys have shown that the reasoning behind this may be due to a desire for a better work-life balance for women and a negative perception of cardiology. Although there is a discrepancy in the number of female physicians specialized in cardiology, women in cardiology have become more involved in leadership roles. These roles may be in research science, health systems administration, professional societies and clinical practice. In scientific research, women have made an impact in scientific inquiry and investigation into the causes and treatments of cardiovascular disease. In leadership roles for the professional cardiology societies, women have increasingly become more involved worldwide. In educational systems, women have become more involved in cardiovascular service and in serving as clinical chiefs and program directors. However, there is still a gap in the number of women serving as deans, chairs of departments, and university presidents. Women make up only 15% of medical school deans and interim deans. Studies have found that women tend to not advance at the same rate as men in the medical field. This could be due to women not receiving independent grants, publications, and leadership positions. Additionally, differences in pay could be attributed to implicit gender and maternal bias. Implicit bias can affect hiring and promoting of women in the medical field because of a belief that women should be held at a higher standard than their male peers. Overall, underrepresentation in the medical field could influence patient care and outcomes. Diversity promotes health equity, and the medical field is continually improving its efforts toward finding the root of the problem of under-representation of women in the medical field. Wage gap Communal specialties, which women are more likely to go into, often have a lower pay than the specialties in which men typically go into. Women have been found to have a larger representation than men in lower-paying specialties, such as pediatrics and men lave a larger representation in higher-paying specialties, such as cardiology and surgery. In New York State between 1999 and 2008, the average starting salary for men was $187,385 whereas the mean starting salary for women was $158,727. In 2001, it was found that male physicians earned roughly around 41% more than their female colleagues. As of 2017, an updated version then found that the percentage had dropped to roughly around 27.7%. That is roughly around a 100,000 dollar difference in salary per year. However, women who work in radiology are the only women who make more than their male colleagues--the difference is only about 2,000 dollars. A study published in 2005 found that women physicians in the US had an annual earning gap of 11% if they were married, 14% if they had one child, and 22% if they had more than one child. Women typically had household obligations that affected their ability to work as much as men and therefore led to a trade-off of higher earnings for family- friendly jobs.  Stereotype threats  A stereotype threat is observed when a stigmatized group is in a situation where negative stereotypes are often used in interpreting their behavior, and the risk of being judged by these stereotypes can elicit a disruptive state that undermines performance and aspirations. As discussed earlier, there are less women in leadership positions in academic medicine. Descriptive and prescriptive gender stereotypes affect women in these roles. A descriptive component consists of beliefs about the inherent characteristics of men and women. At the center of these beliefs is that women are more nurturing, sympathetic kind and caring. Men are often described as agentic or assertive, ambitious and independent. Stereotype threats against women are especially common for women in leadership roles. The stereotype-based perspective towards women has been used to explain the lack of fit for leadership roles in medicine. These stereotypes canter on perceived characteristics, skills and aspirations of women and how they have been perceived to not coincide with what us valued for effective leadership. In a twenty-year study done on stereotype threats, researchers found that stereotype threats can increase feelings of anxiety, mind-wandering, negative thinking, and can decrease the function of working memory. A functional working memory is needed to successfully execute a task in many scenarios. This study also found that individuals experiencing stereotype threats may find it necessary to negate these threats and put forth effort to suppress these thoughts which can be inconsistent with the goals of the task. Male clinicians Males make up approximately 12% of nurses in the United States. Unfortunately, when men enter the profession of nursing, they may encounter barriers that limit their choice of specialty. They run the risk of being labeled and stereotyped, in addition to being relied upon excessively for their strength in lifting patients. These gender biases and role stereotyping occur because many people retain the notion that caring for others is a feminine task, and thus beneath the status of the male. In a British study, it was reported that the majority of subjects assumed that a nurse referred to a female. This type of stereotyping of men is related to nursing being considered a profession for women. Men tend to face two common stereotypes when it comes to being nurses. The first being the stereotype that male nurses are gay since they are in a ‚Äúfeminine occupation.‚Äù The other common stereotype is that men are generally hypersexual and that this will inhibit them from being able to provide intimate care to women in nonsexual ways. Male nurses report being told that a female nurse is preferred and being teased as a child for wanting to be a nurse. Other questions are often asked of male nurses such as 'why did you go into nursing'? Or they are asked if they are gay, failed medical school, or became a nurse because it was easier. Sometimes a male nurse can be asked if he is a nurse so that he can see undressed women. In some instances male nurses were assumed to be the 'muscle' for other female nurses. Male nurses may be passed over for work with female patients, or disallowed on birthing or gynecological units, while male physicians are completely welcome in these situations. In addition, male nurses find that they are pushed toward tasks that are stereotypically consistent with their gender role. Some of these might include heavy lifting, administrative roles, or psychiatric nursing. Despite these drawbacks, male nurses continue to make more money than their female counterparts.

The light green thallus has an applanate to pulvinate habit and is usually around across and thick. It has irregular lobes and moderately firm while alive becoming more spongy once dead. The utricles form in large clusters and are long and coated in many hairs. The species is similar to Codium lucasii which adheres more tightly to rock surfaces. It is epilithic in the subtidal to intertidal zones. Mostly situated in calmer waters from the low tide mark to several metres depth. It is often found in warmer waters but has a scattered distribution in colder waters. The species was first formally described by the botanist Harvey in 1855 in Some account of the marine botany of the colony of Western Australia, published in the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy. The type specimen was collected from King George Sound along the south coast of Western Australia. In Western Australia is found along the coast in the Kimberley and as far south as the Recherche Archipelago. It is also found along South Australian coasts on the Eyre Peninsula, Yorke Peninsula, Kangaroo Island and Fleurieu Peninsula. It is common in all tropical and subtropical waters.

Flooding from the hurricane disabled the refrigeration system at the plant which manufactured organic peroxides. The unrefrigerated organic peroxides decomposed and self-ignited. Arkema Crosby Plant The Arkema plant is located in Crosby, Texas with a staff of approximately 50 workers, and produces 30 types of organic peroxide products. The plant was constructed in 1960, by Wallace & Tiernan. A 1969 merger with Pennsalt created Pennwalt, who owned the plant until it was acquired by Elf Aquitaine in 1990. In 2004, Arkema Inc was formed, and took possession of the facility. The earliest floodplain map located in the Chemical Safety Board investigation, was from September 1985, and indicated the plant was in \\"Zone C - Area of Minimal Flooding\\". A November 1996 update to the floodplain map, placed most of the facility into \\"Other Areas - Zone X - Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain\\". However, a June 2007 update floodplain map now indicated most of the facility was inside of 100-year floodplain, including the storage warehouses, backup generators and electrical transformers for commercial power. A smaller area of the facility was within the 500-year floodplain. The organic peroxides are stored in nine storage buildings. Seven of these buildings are Low Temperature Warehouses, kept at . One building is kept at ambient temperature and the largest storage building contained multiple compartments kept at various temperatures ranging from to ambient temperature. The Low Temperature Warehouses contain two refrigeration systems: mechanical refrigeration units, powered by electricity and a liquid nitrogen system not reliant on electricity. Additionally, refrigerated trailers were used by Arkema as a final emergency backup and when warehouse refrigeration systems need to be shut down for maintenance work. When filled with a full tank of fuel, the trailers could keep the organic peroxides at a safe temperature for more than one week. Arkema stored and transported the organic peroxides in plastic or containers. These were typically stacked on pallets and shrink-wrapped together. A 2016 analysis done by the Houston Chronicle and Texas A&M; identified the Arkema facility as a facility posing a high potential for harm to the public. The analysis and subsequent series by the newspaper revealed major flaws in the regulation of chemical facilities in the U.S. In February 2017, OSHA issued safety fines regarding general safety and maintenance in the sum of $91,724. Timeline Thursday, 24 August 10:00am, Central Daylight Time (CDT), following warnings from the National Hurricane Center that predicted widespread flooding with rainfall of . In the town of Crosby, where the plant was based, forecasts expected in the town of Crosby. Using experiences from past storms, staff at the facility determined a 'ride-out crew' would likely be needed at the plant, as the flooding predicted of floodwaters would render local roads impassible. However, it was believed that while the facility would suffer some flooding that would make travel between buildings difficult, the safety, refrigeration and standby electrical systems would unaffected by the flooding. Friday, 25 August Revisions to weather forecasts raised the expected rainfall to with some areas seeing rainfall amounts of . With flooding of local roads now certain, the ride-out crew was activated. Staff were still confident the facility would have no issues with maintaining refrigeration of organic peroxides on site. During the day, production was discontinued, and staff prepared the facility for Harvey's arrival, securing loose materials, moving portable equipment that could be damaged by flooding, preparing storm equipment, such as an off-road forklift, ensuring fuel tanks were filled and reducing waste water levels in expectation of the significant rain. At 10:00pm CDT, Harvey made landfall northeast of Corpus Christi, Texas. At this time, the National Hurricane Center released another forecast, which now called for rainfall of with isolated amounts up to . Saturday, 26 August Gauge station 1740 recorded a increase in the Cedar Bayou Stream's water level, during the day. Meanwhile, the ride-out crew monitored the facility. Towards the end of the day, they determined preempted electrical shutdowns would be needed to reduce danger of equipment damage and electrocution. During the evening, landline phones failed and water continued to rise, surrounding the Low Temperature Warehouses, where the organic peroxides were stored. Sunday, 27 August At 10:00am CDT, the National Hurricane Center updated its forecast, calling for an additional rainfall and up to over the next several days. Early in the day, the ride-out crew shut down electricity to several Low Temperature Warehouses. Organic peroxides in these warehouses were transferred into refrigerated trailers. The ride-out crew was optimistic that flooding would crest. In addition to the Low Temperature Warehouses, power was also cut off to other structures, the water supply and fire suppression pumps. Additionally some of the backup electrical generators were also compromised by floodwaters, along with the piping for emergency liquid nitrogen tank that was on hand should the mechanical (electrically powered) refrigeration fail. Workers were able to restore this temporarily, however the piping was later submerged again by floodwaters. By the end of the night, only one Low Temperature Warehouse was still operational, with the organic peroxides from the other six warehouses now stored in six refrigerated trailers, now being stored in the 'laydown area' one of the highest points in the facility. Monday, 28 August At 2:00am CDT, commercial power was lost, when transformers were flooded. The two remaining standby generators were activated to continue providing electricity to the last Low Temperature Warehouse. However, one of these generators was quickly flooded. At 3:00am CDT, the ride-out crew began transferring the organic peroxides in the last warehouse into two refrigerated trailers, fearing loss of the last remaining generator. Two hours later, at 5:00am CDT, the last generator was turned off by the ride-out crew. Later that morning, they also discovered that the nitrogen tank was also now inoperable after the piping had become submerged again. Throughout the morning, the forklift and two trucks were lost to rising floodwaters, stranding three trailers by the Low Temperature Warehouses. Water in this area had reached chest height on the ride-out crew. This left around 50 pallets of organic peroxide in the last warehouse. The ride-out crew hand carried the small containers to refrigerated trailers at an adjacent building to keep them cool, finishing this task around midnight. At this point, three trailers, containing 4,000 containers were still sitting in the floodwaters. The ride-out crew was concerned that these trailers would fail and the organic peroxide would began to warm. Tuesday, 29 August The ride-out crew discovered one of the refrigerated trailers that could not be moved from the warehouses had started to lean, and likely going to fail. Additionally, the Arkema corporate crisis team suspected there would be at least one fire caused by decomposition of the organic peroxides, and decided to have the ride-out crew evacuate the facility. After a final inspection by boat, the ride-out crew was evacuated by Harris County emergency responders by boat around 12:00pm CDT. At some point during the day, the secondary containment dikes around the wastewater tanks were overcome by floodwaters, and two tanks released approximately of organic materials mixed with floodwaters and escaped the facility. Due to the likelihood of a fire from the decomposing organic peroxides, emergency personnel established a evacuation zone around the plant, and evacuated approximately 205 residents from this area. Notably, this evacuation area included U.S. Highway 90, one of the few major roads that remained not impacted by flooding. Wednesday, August 30 A Unified Command was set up at the Crosby fire station, to coordinate the response to the eventual fire at the facility, consisting of Arkema personnel, various environmental agencies, and fire departments. Roadblocks and air monitoring stations were put into place at the edges of the evacuation zone. Due to the flooding of Interstate 10, emergency personnel continued to use U.S. Highway 90, as closing the U.S. 90 would have resulted in a multi-hour detour, effectively cutting off Houston from Beaumont. Near midnight, two police officers traveling along U.S. 90 entered the evacuation area at the northern end, and eventually entered a \\"large cloud of gas\\" near the Arkema plant. The officers turned around, and retreated back to the northern edge of the evacuation zone, having irritation to their eyes, skin and respiratory systems. The officers closed the highway, and reported the cloud to the Unified Command. Thursday, August 31 Just after midnight, Arkema personnel data from sensors from six of the nine trailers. The data showed no indications of a temperature increase within these six trailers. Firefighters were sent out to the facility, but failed to observe any signs of organic peroxide decomposition. At 12:30am CDT, U.S. Highway 90 was reopened by Unified Command. CSB investigators suspect that the chemical cloud may have originated in one of the three trailers not fitted with equipment to remotely report temperature data. Several police officers drove U.S. 90 from the northern edge of the evacuation zone, and entered a cloud of gas. Upon reaching the southern end of the evacuation zone, multiple officers reported nausea, headaches. Additionally, Emergency medical technicians called to assist the police officers, drove through the cloud. Twenty-one first responders were taken to a local hospital for examination due to exposure to smoke. Unified Command closed U.S. 90 until 4 September. At 2:00am CDT, the contents of the refrigerated trailer that had tipped, decomposed and ignited the trailer. Friday, 1 September At 10:00am CDT, Harris County helicopters surveyed the facility and noticed the eight remaining trailers were stable and showing no signs of decomposition. However, around 5:00pm CDT two more trailers caught on fire, both of which were located in floodwaters near the Low Temperature Warehouses. The six remaining trailers, all located in the higher 'laydown area' showed no signs of decomposition. Saturday, 2 September The six trailers in the 'laydown area' were still intact. A survey flight conducted around 1:20pm CDT determined a trailer had lost its cooling capacity. Infrared images determined one of the trailers was leaking a substance that was at an elevated temperature, that was suspected to be a byproduct of decomposition of the organic peroxides. At 7:00pm CDT Unified Command and Arkema decided to carry out a controlled burn of the remaining trailers. However, a storage tank filled with isobutylene was located about . It was decided that the burn would be conducted with the trailer closest to the tank being left until last, to use it as a heat shield while burning the other trailers. Sunday, 3 September A survey flight in the morning revealed more materials leaking from the trailers. Responders met at 10:00am CDT to reevaluate the plan, and ultimately decided to move forward with it. At 12:45 the plan was started, with an entry team confirming no leaking decomposed organic peroxides were near the isobutylene tank. It was confirmed the leaking material was not near the tank, and at 3:40pm CDT, the controlled burn was started. At 9:00pm CDT air monitoring was conducted in the evacuation zone, which showed no elevated readings of hazardous gases. Monday, September 4 At 1:00am CDT, Unified Command ended the evacuation order, allowing residents back into their homes and reopened U.S. Highway 90. Floodwater contamination In addition to the explosions, two wastewater tanks overflowed during the storm, releasing more than 23,000 pounds of contaminants that were carried by floodwaters into nearby homes. Noxious toxins including heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, dioxins and semi-volatile organic compounds have been identified in homes and soil in neighborhoods near the plant. It is uncertain what proportion of the chemical residues originated in gases released by the plant, and what proportion flowed out of the flooded wastewater tanks. Investigations Chemical Safety Board On Thursday, August 31, 2017, the same day as the first fire, the U.S. Chemical Safety Board announced an investigation. This report concluded on 24 May 2018. The report made five recommendations, directed at four entities: As of January 2020, the Chemical Safety Board classifies the three recommendations made to Arkema Inc/Arkema Crosby Facility as 'Open - Awaiting Response or Evaluation/Approval of Response (O - ARE/AR)'. The recommendations sent to Harris County and CCPS are marked as 'Open - Acceptable Response or Alternate Response (O - ARAR)' Other investigations The Environmental Protection Agency began formally asking questions of Arkema on September 7, 2017.  Fight over public records  When Arkema North American CEO Richard Rowe announced at a press conference that nothing could prevent an explosion at the Crosby facility, reporters requested documents about the plant. The company repeatedly refused to disclose detailed chemical inventories, facility maps and other documents about the Crosby site to the public, citing concerns about terrorism. Many of the documents were later released to reporters after Freedom of Information requests. Arkema's 2016 and 2017 detailed chemical inventories, also known as Tier IIs, remain secret. Legal proceedings In September, emergency workers who responded to the explosion filed a lawsuit against the plant for damage to their health caused by the negligence of plant management. In September, the civil attorney for Harris County (Houston area) has announced an investigation, and the criminal district attorney announced a pending lawsuit against Arkema.

Two classes of cruciform DNA have been described; folded and unfolded. Folded cruciform structures are characterized by the formation of acute angles between adjacent arms and main strand DNA. Unfolded cruciform structures have square planar geometry and 4-fold symmetry in which the two arms of the cruciform are perpendicular to each other. The formation of cruciform structures in linear DNA is thermodynamically unfavorable due to the possibility of base unstacking at junction points and open regions at loops. Cruciform DNA is found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and has a role in the transcription of DNA, double strand repair, DNA translocation and recombination. Cruciform structures can increase genomic instability and are involved in the formation of various diseases, such as cancer.  Biological significance  Cruciform DNA structures are stabilized through supercoiling and their formation alleviates stress generated from DNA supercoiling. Cruciform structures block the recognition of the tet promoter in pX by RNA polymerase. The cruciform structures can also disrupt a step in the kinetic pathway, shown when gyrase is inhibited by novobiocin. Cruciform structures regulate transcription initiation such as the suppression of pX transcription. DNA replication can then be inhibited by cruciform containing tertiary structures of DNA formed during recombination, which can be studied to help treat malignancy. Recombination is also observed in Holliday junctions, a type of cruciform structure.  RuvA / RuvB repair  In bacterial plasmids, RuvA and RuvB repair DNA damage, and are involved in the recombination process of Holliday junctions. These proteins are also responsible for regulating branch migration. During branch migration, the RuvAB complex helps to initiate recombination when it binds and unzips the Holliday junction, like DNA helicase, and also when the RuvAB/Holliday junction complex is cleaved, once RuvC binds to it.  p53 binding to cruciform forming targets  Another example of cruciform structure significance is seen in the interaction between p53, a tumor suppressor, and cruciform forming sequences. p53 binding correlates with inverted repeat sequences, such as the ones that help form cruciform DNA structures. Under negative superhelical stress p53 binds preferentially to cruciform forming targets due to the A/T rich environment which feature these necessary inverted repeat sequences.

He is a strong advocate of Israel, and is critical of both the Catholic ChurchPaddy Monaghan, 'The Vatican Against Israel ‚Äì J‚Äôaccuse‚Äù by Giulio Meotti: a Catholic Response,' Catholics for Israel, 19 March 2014 and of Jews who are themselves critical of Israel, regarding them as abettors of anti-semitism. He was subject to accusations of engaging in plagiarizing the work of other journalists, and since has worked for Il Foglio and Arutz Sheva.  Biography  Meotti was born in Arezzo, the son of a goldsmith, who had an extensive clientale of polyglot Jews from whom Meotti is said to have absorbed their cosmopolitan outlook. He graduated in philosophy at the University of Florence with a Phd about George Steiner. Criticism of Jewish critics of Israel In his book Jews against Israel (2014)Giulio Meotti,Ebrei contro Israele, (Salomone Belforte Editore 2014. Meotti took to task a large number of Jewish critics of Israel's behavior towards Palestinians, accusing them variously of intellectual treason, Jewish anti-Semitism, of being self-hating JewsFiona Diwan, 'Questa brava gente che odia Israele,' Bet Magazine mosaico 11 settembre 2015 as suffering from what in his view was a 'pathology' of Jewish anti-israelism or as being 'deranged' (squilibrati) Jew-haters'. The list of notable Jews he censures for their attitudes towards Israel and defense of human rights of Palestinians includes George Steiner, the philosopher Hannah Arendt, the Franco-German politician Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the former Chancellor of Austria Bruno Kreisky, Pulitzer prize-winning playwright and screenwriterTony Kushner, director Steven Spielberg, British historian Eric Hobsbawm, the bioethics and moral philosopher Peter Singer, British politician Gerald Kaufman, French journalist Jean Daniel, French essayist Dominique Vidal, the Argentinian civil rights activist Jacobo Timerman, rabbi Arnold Wolf philosopher Edgar Morin, the United Nations special rapporteur for Palestinian rights Richard A. Falk, the American historian Norman Finkelstein, English film, director Mike Leigh, neuroscientist Steven Rose and his wife, the sociologist Hilary Rose, rabbi Michael Lerner, Nobel-prize winning dramatist Harold Pinter, philosopher Judith Butler, the historian Tony Judt, the orientalist scholar Maxime Rodinson, Italian novelist Natalia Ginzburg, the Italian Germanist Cesare Cases, the antifascist intellectual Emilio Sereni, the poet and literary critic Franco Fortini, the Italian journalist Gad Lerner, the Italian Yiddish playwright and musician Moni Ovadia, the Israeli biochemist and philosopher of Judaism Yeshayahu Leibowitz, the Israeli historian Shlomo Sand, the Israeli political geographer Oren Yiftachel, the Israeli political scientist Neve Gordon, the Israeli journalist Amira Hass Israeli historian Moshe Zimmermann, the Israeli historian Ilan Papp√©, the Israeli conflict theorist Lev Grinberg, the Israeli historians Tom Segev and Idith Zertal, the Argentinian musician and comic Danny Rabinovitch, the Israeli novelists Amos Oz, David Grossman and Abraham Yehoshua, the cosmopolitan conductor Daniel Barenboim, and the diplomat Martin Indyk, and survivors of the Holocaust such as Warsaw ghetto survivor Marek Edelman, Marion Kozak (the mother of David Miliband and Ed Miliband), the sociologist Zygmunt Bauman, resistance leader St√©phane Hessel, the Israeli political scientist Zeev Sternhell, the French historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet, the writer Primo Levi and the writer Isaac Deutscher.Giulio Meotti, Chi sono gli ebrei in guerra con Gerusalemme, Il Foglio 11 Maggio 2014 Meotti's polemic against Jewish writers, thinkers, and cultural figures critical of Israeli actions was described as 'vitriolic' by reviewer Stefano Caviglia writing for Panorama. Caviglia suggested that the real weakness of Jews who are overly critical of Israel lies in a putative inability to resist ‚Äòexternal pressure‚Äô, in what he considers a ‚Äòneed to be accepted and considered politically correct by their readers or friends (Jews and non-Jews) of the same political leaning.' At the same time, he added, one should remember that the Jews have an enduring tendency for controversies, as summed up in the age old adage:‚ÄôTwo Jews, three opinions.‚Äô Stefano Caviglia, 'Ebrei contro Israele,' Panorama 30 April 2014. Work Since 2003, Meotti has written for the Italian daily newspaper Il Foglio, where he is the Cultural Editor. He has in the past written articles for the rightwing think tank Gatestone Institute, The Wall Street Journal,Giulio Meotti, 'Italia, R.I.P.,' Wall Street Journal 7 September 2010 Commentary, National Review, the West Bank settler newspaper Arutz Sheva, Jerusalem Post, Fox News, J√ºdische Allgemeine, Yedioth Ahronoth and FrontPage Magazine. His book A New Shoah: The Untold Story of Israel's Victims of Terrorism, which was translated in English and Norwegian, was described by Israeli President Reuven Rivlin as \\"a valuable publication that presents a comprehensive picture of the many acts of terrorism against Israeli citizens.\\" A New Shoah: The Untold Story of Israel's Victims of Terrorism Encounter Books 2010, blurb. Charges of plagiarism In mid 2012, Meotti was accused by Marc Tracy in Tablet of being a 'serial plagiarist' for lifting, unacknowledged, material written by other journalists. The accusation was also endorsed by Max Blumenthal who provided several other examples of apparent copyright violations.Max Blumenthal, 'Giulio Meotti:Serial plagiarist or common hasbarist?,' OpEdNews 19 May 2012. When this documentation imputing to Meotti a practice of copying other journalists emerged, not only Ynet but also Commentary magazine‚Äôs John Podhoretz severed their relationship with him for having engaged in journalistic theft.Marc Tracy, 'Op-ed on Israeli Gay Rights Lifts Without Credit,' The Tablet May 16, 2012.Marc Tracy, 'Italian Journalist Also Plagiarized in U.S. Outlets,' The Tablet May 22, 2012. In self-defense, Meotti stated that if he indeed quoted without crediting his sources it was just carelessness, but claimed the accusations were actually a form of demonization of himself, whom he described as one of \\"the last and few pro-Israel journalists in Europe,\\" part of an ad hominem campaign infused with envy which had been ongoing for some years.Sydney Smith, ‚Äò YNet Puts ‚ÄòClarification‚Äô on Op-ed with Plagiarized Content, Journalist Apologizes,‚Äô IMedia Ethics 26 May 26, 2012 According to Blumenthal, Meotti considered the accusations as forms of incitement that put his life at risk.Max Blumenthal, 'Giulio Meotti: Serial Plagiarist or Common Hasbarist?:Update,' Al-Akhbar 18 May 2012:'Meotti responds by accusing me of placing him in danger, or at least causing him to \\"suffer.\\" But so far, any suffering that Meotti has endured has been self- inflicted. Meotti: \\"But this is a personal attack against my person and work of ten years, a demonization, a witch hunt against one of the last and few pro-Israel journalists in Europe. An attack in which arrogant and failed journalists didn‚Äôt hesitate to call me ‚Äòhasbarist‚Äô and ‚Äòzionist‚Äô in Arab newspapers. It seems that they don‚Äôt understand the consequences and the severe risks that an author like me in Europe can suffer because of their incitement \\".'  Political views  Meotti describes himself as a liberal conservative.  Private life  Meotti is married and has two children. He resides in Rome.  Bibliography  * Il processo della scimmia.

Lesbianism was not criminalized as was male homosexuality in Switzerland during her activist period, however Vock faced public recrimination for her work in publishing, was monitored by police, and arrested. Amaticia In 1931 together with Laura Thoma Vock formed the group Amiticia, taking the position of secretary. The aim of the organization was to relieve the isolation of lesbians and through strong associations promote acceptance and visibility. The original ad in lesbian magazine Garconne proclaimed: \\"Sisters of Lesbos, you too have a full right to love and its freedom.\\" In October of the same year, Volk joined the gay organization, Excentric Zurich Club (EZC) and made it an integrated organization, in which Volk herself became president in 1933. Freuntshafts-Banner / Der Kreis In 1932, Thoma and EZC member August Bambula founded the magazine Freundschafts- Banner, which changed its name several times, to eventually become Der Kreis (The circle, 1942-1967), the primary homosexual publication in Europe. Vock was involved at the beginning, focusing on the women's section and personal ads, but became more and more involved, eventually becoming the editor and publisher of the magazine from 1933-1942. During her time as editor, Volk was targeted by multiple sources for her work on the paper.

Personal life  Abraham Godwin was born to Captain Abraham Godwin and Phebe Coole in Totowa, New Jersey. His father built up the area around Totowa, now known as Paterson, New Jersey, building the Godwin Hotel and creating the first stage coach line for tourists to travel to the Passaic Falls. Abraham Godwin married Mary Maria Munson on July 3, 1783 in the First Presbyterian Church in Morristown, New Jersey. They had nine children, Phebe, Henry, Caleb, Susanna, Abraham, Maria, Catharine, Elizabeth, and Margaret. His son Henry committed suicide after going bankrupt producing cotton in 1816. His grandson, Parke Godwin, was an acclaimed author and journalist.  Career   Revolutionary War  Abraham's father joined the American cause in early 1776 and was Captain of Marines stationed on board the USS Lady Washington in New York City. Abraham's older brother Henry became a Quartermaster in Fishkill, New York, and his younger brother David was a Drummer. Abraham and David were re-united with their father when they enlisted in New York City. Abraham's father survived getting shot during the Siege of New York. Knowing the topography of New Jersey, they led George Washington's army to Totowa where he stayed at the Godwin Hotel. After that they split ways, Washington to the Delaware River, and the Godwins to Fishkill. The Godwins had much debt to the Tories, and lost half their land as a result. The British raided the Godwin homestead, stripping Phebe and the daughters of everything. This sickened Abraham's father even more, to the point where he died early in 1777. In the spring, Abraham, Henry, and David were ordered to Fort Montgomery to lay a chain across the North River. On October 7, 1777 the Battle of Forts Clinton and Montgomery took place. David was ordered to send for help, Henry was captured by the British, and Abraham jumped into the Hudson and swam to shore. Abraham was present at the Siege of Yorktown, witnessed the surrender of Charles Cornwallis to George Washington, and received an honorable discharge signed by George Washington. Abraham Godwin, now Brigadier General of the New Jersey militia, marches a troop of Seventy Six men to Sandy Hook point, where they would build the first American forts. August 17th, 1814.  Master Engraver  Towards the end of the war Abraham became an engraving apprentice of Andrew Billings, a silversmith and an engraver of bookplates. Within a few years Abraham became better than his master. Abraham soon found himself with high-profile projects, like his engraving of the certificate for the General Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen of the City of New York or his certificate for the Fire Department of New York City, among others. http://metmuseum.org/art/collection/sea He most likely painted a portrait of George Washington while he stayed at the Passaic Hotel.  Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures  Alexander Hamilton had envisioned the Passaic Falls as a powerhouse for manufacturing since his first visit in 1778. While he was Treasury Secretary he led the Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures and they decided on the newly named Paterson. They met at the Godwin Hotel. Abraham led the group surveying the land surrounding the falls. Hamilton made the final call to place the factories right next to the falls rather than dig expensive canals to place them miles away. They all agreed.  New Jersey General Assembly (1802-1806)  Abraham voted for the gradual abolition of slavery in 1804, and the law was overruled in 1807. Godwin also attended numerous lodge meetings with the Freemasons in Trenton, New Jersey from 1802-1820.  Brigadier General in the War of 1812  Abraham quickly rose to the rank of Brigadier General because of his time in the New Jersey State Legislature. His son was a Lieutenant. He patrolled the beaches between Atlantic City and Sandy Hook, and was praised when he brought volunteers from Paterson to help build the first fort in Sandy Hook.  Later life  Abraham retired to a peaceful life running a hotel in Paterson. He wrote poems and songs, continued engraving, and made many paintings. The Godwin Hotel was a well known tourist attraction while he was alive. It was advertised in the papers that there was always a fiddler ready to play. He was nominated the only elector for Andrew Jackson in New Jersey in 1828. In 1829, the greatest honor was bestowed upon him, the township just north of the Passaic river was named Godwinville.  Death  He died of unknown causes in Paterson on October 5, 1835.  Legacy  Godwinville was renamed Ridgewood in the 1876 by Samuel and Cornelia Dayton. The Paterson and Ramapo Railroad Company fought this decision.http://theridgewoodblog.net/history-of-the-village-of-ridgewood/ The Godwin Hotel lost its prestige after Abraham died, and it fell into disrepair. The building was torn down in 1915. Many remnants of Godwin still remain in Paterson, Ridgewood, and the surrounding areas. There are two roads in Paterson, Godwin Street and Godwin Avenue, that were chopped in half by the train tracks. From Wyckoff through Midland Park and ending at Ridgewood another Godwin Avenue exists, formerly known as Godwinville Road. In 1951, the Captain Abraham Godwin chapter of the Sons of the American Revolution erected a monument in to Abraham Godwin in Van Neste Square in Ridgewood, New Jersey. In 2016, the monument had lights installed so it could be viewed at night.

Geometric, Algebraic and Topological Methods for Quantum Field Theory Villa de Leyva Summer School ‚Äì 2017 Xenia de la Ossa is known for her contributions to mathematical physics with much of her work focusing on string theory and its interplay with algebraic geometry. In 1991, she coauthored \\"A pair of Calabi-Yau manifolds as an exactly soluble superconformal theory\\", which contained remarkable predictions about the number of rational curves on a quintic threefold. This was the first work to use mirror symmetry in order to make enumerative predictions in algebraic geometry, which moreover went far beyond what could be proved at the time using the available techniques within the area. This paper was cited in the more important books about String Theory. In 2004, Roger Penrose mentioned it in his book The Road to Reality: The breakthrough enumerative predictions of the de la Ossa et al paper were eventually confirmed for low degrees of the curves (up to 9) and required corrections in higher degree.

The event is marked by military parades, fireworks and ceremonies around of the country.  History  The day has its roots with the Red Army Day in the Soviet Union. On February 23, 1992, President Emomali Rahmon signed a decree establishing the Armed Forces of Tajikistan. Also known as the Tajik National Army, it now consists of the Air and Air Defense Forces, the Ground Forces and Mobile Forces, all of which serve under the Ministry of Defence. The armed forces also includes the Presidential National Guard, the Border Guards Day and the Tajik Internal Troops under the Ministry of Internal Affairs (VKD). February 23 is also celebrated in Russia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, and partially recognized republics of South Ossetia and Transnistria as Defender of the Fatherland Day.  Military events and notable celebrations  Celebrations of Tajik National Army Day are organized by the Ministry of Defence. On most years, the anniversary of the Tajik National Army is celebrated during events held in Victory Park, Dushanbe, where wreaths are laid. On jubilee years, the Tajik defence ministry will decide to hold a large military parade of the Dushanbe Garrison (similar to the Tajikistan Independence Day Military Parade) through the center of Dushanbe. Concerts of Tajik military bands will also take place in the city and throughout the country. With the holiday coinciding with Defender of the Fatherland Day, it is commonplace for personnel of the Russian 201st Military Base in Tajikistan to celebrate Armed Forces Day alongside their Tajik counterparts.  1993  The first military parade of Tajikistan took place in Dushanbe in honor of the founding of the Tajik National Army, which took place that same day. The parade was commanded by the country's first defence minister, Colonel Alexander Shishlyannikov, as well as Colonel Ramazon Radjabov (the Deputy Minister of Defense), an officer who often considered to be a potential successor to Shishlyannikov.https://asiaplustj.info/ru/news/tajikistan/society/20170615/on- ne-vernulsya-iz-boya Participants in the parade were attended an induction ceremony in the presence of President Rahmon Nabiyev on Ozodi Square prior to the start of the parade.https://www.c-span.org/video/?38204-1/russian- national-newscast  2003  It was dedicated to the 10th anniversary of the Tajik military.

She has directed plays by Dan Dietz, Kyle Schmidt, Heather Raffo, Jose Rivera, Quiara Alegr√≠a Hudes, and Kristoffer Diaz. As an actress, she has been on stages at The Humana Festival of New Plays, The Goodman Theater, Berkeley Repertory Theater, Long Wharf Theater, New York Theatre Workshop and Brooklyn Academy of Music. She is also the voice of many characters in the Nickelodeon cartoons Dora the Explorer and Go, Diego, Go!. As the producer, director and co-author (with Emily Ackerman) of ReEntry, a play based on interviews with Marines returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, KJ produced its international tour and contracted with the United States Department of Defense, taking the play to service members at over thirty military bases and hospitals throughout the US and internationally. KJ is a former member of Anne Bogart‚Äôs SITI Company, an Associate Artist with The Civilians, a Fox Fellow, Douglas Wollop Fellow, Albert Award Nominee, an NEA CDP recipient and a TCG Doris Duke/Andrew W. Mellon Foundation New Generations Future Leaders Recipient. Life and career Sanchez was born and raised in Tome, New Mexico, where she attended Belen public school. She earned her Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of California, San Diego in 1989, followed by a Master of Fine Arts degree in Theatre ‚Äì also from UCSD ‚Äì in 1992. Sanchez started her theater career as an actor. She played Juliet and Ophelia at the Actors Theater of Louisville, both productions directed by Jon Jory. She also worked extensively with Anne Bogart‚Äôs SITI Company and was a company member from 1994-1997. With SITI Company, Sanchez played Mille Owen in Picnic, Hermia in A Midsummer Night‚Äôs Dream, Sibyl in Private Lives (all directed by Anne Bogart), and more. In 2000, Sanchez originated the role of Thyona in the world premiere of Charles Mee‚Äôs Big Love(Humana Festival) and went on to perform the play at Long Wharf, Berkeley Repertory Theater, The Goodman and Brooklyn Academy of Music. In 2001, Sanchez shifted her focus to writing and directing ‚Äì she made Too Much Water (a devised piece about Shakespeare‚Äôs Ophelia, madness, and suicide) at the University of Washington. The next year, also at the University of Washington, Sanchez made Panaphobia, a play based on interviews about phobias and fears and the culture of fear in America. From there, Sanchez went on to create Handcuff Girl Saves the World with the Ensemble at Washington Ensemble Theater. Sanchez then wrote Highway 47, an autobiographical piece exploring the history of her hometown and an inter-family land feud that nearly destroyed both clan and community. Highway 47 began as an ensemble play produced by Working Classroom in Albuquerque, New Mexico; it was later rewritten as a solo play, commissioned by Two River Theater and performed by Sanchez. The solo version of Highway 47 was produced by Yo Solo Festival, HERE, and Frontera Rep (with another actress playing Sanchez). Cornerstone Theatre commissioned Sanchez to write For All Time, and in 2008, they produced the play about America‚Äôs criminal justice system. The following year, Life in the Middle was commissioned and produced by Asolo Repertory Theater and Two River Theater Company. Based on interviews with real students, Life in the Middle is a musical designed for actors in middle school to perform with their own rock band. American Records In 2010, Sanchez founded American Records, a theater company with the mission ‚Äúto make plays that chronicle our time, plays that serve as a bridge between people.‚Äù In line with this mission, American Records often makes documentary plays based on interviews conducted by Sanchez and other company members. American Records first developed ReEntry, a play Sanchez co-wrote with Emily Ackerman. ReEntry is ‚Äúan unflinching look at the lives of Marines getting ready for and returning from deployment, ReEntry is a docudrama exploration of the challenges faced when re-entering family, community and country. Honest, moving, and surprisingly funny, this play is based entirely on interviews with Marines and their families.‚Äù ReEntry was commissioned and produced by Two River Theater Company, and received further productions at Urban Stages, Baltimore‚Äôs CENTERSTAGE, Round House Theater Company, Actors Theater of Louisville, and more. In addition to these productions, ReEntry also tours and, through American Records, works directly with the military. The United States Department of Defense uses the play as post-deployment resiliency training, for which the company goes to bases and performs the play followed by town-hall and break-out discussions with base chaplains, social workers, psychiatrists and therapists. ReEntry has toured to over 50 military bases, hospitals, and VA centers in the US and abroad. With Jenny Mercein, Sanchez was co-commissioned by Berkeley Repertory Theater and CENTERSTAGE to create X‚Äôs and O‚Äôs (a football love story), a docudrama exploring American identity and ritual, football, and the game‚Äôs traumatic effect on players and their families. Berkeley Rep produced the world premiere, directed by Tony Tacconi. American Records is an S Corporation, of which Sanchez is the owner and CEO. The company works under the fiscal sponsorship of Fractured Atlas and is pioneering a new model for theater company operation; all the money made by American Records in earned and contributed revenue goes directly to pay artists fees and productions costs. As a result, the company has very little overhead and is able to reach a wider variety of theaters and audiences. Sanchez designed a model for touring flexibility that allows plays to be produced in new ways and tour to a multitude of venues. American Records also regularly collaborates with other theaters, often making projects for specific communities as well as helping theaters with community engagement and outreach. A current project is Cincinnati King, which documents the King Records label and its founder, Syd Nathan. King Records was one of the first racially integrated businesses in Cincinnati and was a revolutionary presence in the music industry for two decades starting in the 1940s, ‚Äúmaking enormous contributions‚Äù to the birth of Rock and Roll.

He built the Godwin Hotel, and opened a stage coach line for tourists visiting the Passaic Falls, briefly holding a monopoly. In April 1758, after making a good impression on the Dutch, Abraham was selected Town Collector for the Saddle River Township, now known as Saddle Brook. Godwin became a member of the general committee of local government in 1775. Early settlement in New Jersey Godwin's parents came over from England in 1720 and worked as a carpenter for the Dey company in New York City. He visited the Falls of the Passaic and was determined to leave the city to build a new life for himself. Even the natives encouraged him to do so. The Dey company was determined to keep one of their best workers so they offered him all the property west of Broadway and south of Dey street on the southern tip of Manhattan. In 1755 Abraham Godwin purchased lot Number eight of the Boght Division of the Acquackanonk Patent, (now Riverside), Paterson, New Jersey). Originally, Godwin built a house across the street from the notorious Godwin Hotel (later renamed Passaic Hotel). He brought his family from New York City to the country when the house was finished. The Native-Americans would still come and camp across the river for a few weeks during the summer. They were friendly, and Abraham would give them liquor but told them that it could make them violent. They understood his warnings and would use it to dance. His children would play with the natives and come home covered in paint and pine needle attire. The Ringwood Iron Works would travel through Paterson to get to the city and over time Abraham got to know the management at the company. They appointed Godwin as an agent to get Iron from the city. He bought a large tract of land on the other side of the river. If the river would become too high to cross, the iron would be stored on this land. He then built two more houses, the Doremus house and the Benson house. The Benson house was demolished in August 1883. When he would go into the city the natives would send warriors to his dwelling to keeps its occupants safe. He had three sons, Henry, Abraham and David. American Revolution Godwin joined the American Revolutionary War in New York on February 13, 1776, after a failed attempt to join in New Jersey. He was declared enemy of the King. Abraham owned considerable real estate, but his creditor from New York City, who was loyal to the King, demanded he pay off his debts. In order to satisfy his creditor, half of his estate was sold to Jacob Van Winkle, a neighbor and well-known Tory. Godwin built another house with a half acre he bought from Abraham Van Houten. Abraham was stationed in New York City as Captain of Marines on board the row galley USS Lady Washington. Godwin was shot sometime around the Battle of Brooklyn, but survived.https://archive.org/details/journalsofprovin02newy Godwin was wounded in 1777 and taken to Fishkill, New York, where he died. He was buried at the Fishkill Supply Depot Burial Ground. After the war, his son Abraham Godwin reclaimed the family Hotel and estate. He ran the Hotel very successfully until his death in 1835.

It is more commonly known as the Circular-scaled Chameleon.  Habitat  The habitat for Kinyongea gyrolepis has been heavily logged and is under severe threat. Found in high elevation mosaic habitats of the Lendu Plateau, a shrubby grassland and former montane forest which has been cleared for agriculture. The chameleons reside in shrubby habitats, although it is thought this is not the original habitat and the species has been shifted from forests as they were cleared. Although Kinyongia are typically found in forest areas this species is not, suggesting a habitat shift is in progress.  Distribution  The Kinyongia gyrolepis is found in the Lendu Plateau region, west of Lake Albert in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is found in the grassland areas, although this could be attributed to the destruction of afromontane forest areas in its habitat range. All recent specimens have been collected within 1 km of afromontane areas which were totally cleared in the last 10 years.  Conservation  Given uncertainty and paucity of records, and the fact that recently a lot of the species habitat has been cleared, the IUCN has been unable to give this species a rating, instead opting for 'data deficient'. There has been no current CITES quota for this species.

The neighbourhood owes its name to the large bend that the river forms on its North Arm.  History  Big Bend, originally called \\"Fraser Arm,\\" has been an agricultural community since 1861. The British Columbia Electric Railway tram line cut through the neighbourhood, with many streets today bearing the same names as the former tramway's multiple stations. The same right-of-way is used for freight today.  Boundaries  Big Bend is bounded by Marine Drive to the north, Fenwick Street to the east, the Fraser River to the south and Boundary Road to the west.  Geography  Big Bend is flat and to the north borders the more rugged South Slope neighbourhood of Burnaby. Due to its unique geography and proximity to the Fraser River it remains a flood risk; in December 2014, 100 millilitres of rain flooded parts of Big Bend, although the City of Burnaby's dike system and other anti-flood measures mitigated the damage.  Demographics  The neighbourhood is very thinly populated and consists of productive farmland, industrial parks, movie studios, and commercial areas such as the Big Bend Crossing and Market Crossing malls to the north and south of Marine Way. The formerly narrow and quiet Byrne Road now fronts many commercial businesses along the route to the popular Burnaby Fraser Foreshore Park, which offers riverside paths and trails, outdoor gym equipment, an off-leash dog zone, picnic and fishing spots, and a playground.  Agriculture  Big Bend is known for being the only \\"true\\" farmland left on the Burrard Peninsula. It maintains small to medium-sized farms, community farms north of Marine Way on Willard Street, and almost six hectares of community gardens on Meadow Avenue. The farms are company owned, and they are protected under the Agricultural Land Reserve. Chinese-Canadians have for decades leased or owned market gardens on the rich soils of Big Bend after draining the natural cranberry marshes once used by First Nations.  Main roads  Main roads include Marine Way (which continues to New Westminster and links to the Queensborough Bridge), Marine Drive, North Fraser Way, and Byrne Road.

It manufactured explosives for use in quarries, mines and fireworks. During World War I (1914‚Äì18) it manufactured munitions. It expanded after the war, producing explosives for civil use. During World War II (1939‚Äì45) production was scaled back drastically, but expanded again after the war. The powder mill was fully privatized in 2008. Location and facilities The powder mill is located in the communes of Vonges and Pontailler-sur-Sa√¥ne, east of Dijon in the department of the C√¥te d'Or. The site is bounded by the B√®ze and Sa√¥ne rivers. Etienne Berthelot de Planeuf, Commissary General of Powders and Saltpeter, leased the site beside the B√®ze river on 20 February 1691 to build two powder mills, a powder grinder, a winter dryer, a powder magazine and a small refinery. The five year leases were renewed until July 1753, when the site was purchased outright by Charles-Emmanuel Pioche, Inspector-General of Powder and Saltpeter. A decree by the King in the Council of State of 18 January 1757 confirmed that the contract was perpetual. The facilities were expanded with another powder mill, a moulder and a shed. The General Services buildings were erected in 1810‚Äì13, and another powder magazine was built in 1825. Further extensions began in 1839, and the facilities were completely overhauled. There were offices, manufacturing buildings and dwellings to the east of the powder mill, and around a yard to the west there were storage buildings, carpentry and cooperage workshops. Between 1840 and 1850 two canals were built to supply hydraulic machinery. Earth banks and rows of trees secured the site. Operations The main products produced by the Vonges powder mill were gunpowder, potassium chlorate powders (Cheddite type powders) and nitrogenous and chlorinated explosives. Private companies packaged the powders into cartridges for mine and quarry explosives. The institution also conducted surveillance and inspection of industrial establishments and fireworks factories using the explosives. The number of products increased through the 19th and early 20th century. The facility developed manufacture of chlorate explosives, or \\"mine powders\\", for use in iron ore mines in the Briey basin. In 1870 the mill was one of four military powder works, under the direction of an artillery colonel. On 31 May 1873 the powder mill held an auction of of glycerol, of sulfuric acid and of nitric acid. Dynamite cartridge with fuse for military use, made at the Poudrerie de Vonges In the 1870s another were added for a dynamite factory. The official composition of the dynamite at this and other French powder works was 75% nitroglycerin, 20.8% randanite silica, 3.8% Vierzon silica and 0.4% magnesium carbonate. There were explosions in 1881 and 1882. Production of dynamite was stopped in 1885. In September 1887 the powder mill sold of dynamite to the Soci√©t√© g√©n√©rale de dynamite in Paris that was declared to be superior but was found to be inert. The dynamite was of very low quality, with the cartridges holding about 30% nitroglycerin. Map of the powder mill in 1884 In 1875 the powder mill covered over . In 1876 a small amount of land was acquired for more buildings. An earth embankment was built in 1877. Buildings continued to be added or rebuilt in the years that followed, including factories, sheds and lodgings, and trees were planted. As of 1890 the powder mill covered and employed 204 workers. By 1891 the powder mill was one of ten in France, the others being at Esquerdes, Saint-Poncy, Le Ripault (Monts, Indre-et-Loire), Pont de Buis, Angoul√™me, Saint-Chamas, Toulouse, Saint-M√©dard and Sevran-Livry. At the start of the 20th century the powder mill manufactured gunpowder, picric acid, cresylite (trinitrocresol and picric acid), TNT, Cheddites and the \\"prom√©th√©e\\" explosive. World Wars (1914‚Äì45) At the start of the World War I (1914‚Äì18) the site covered , and had an interior network of Decauville railways between the facilities. The daily production capacity was 4 tons of gunpowder, 7 tons of melinite, 5 tons of cheddite and 1 ton of nitronaphthalene, produced by 281 workers. Capacity expanded steadily to produce a greater quantity and variety of explosives. The powder mill was connected to the Auxonne-Gray railway line, and the internal railway network was expanded. A wharf was built on the Sa√¥ne for water transport. The manufacturing and storage facilities were expanded and barracks were built to house a rapidly growing workforce. The mining engineer Jules Aubrun was assigned to the powder mill in 1915‚Äì16. By May 1918 the facility covered and employed 2,744 workers. Of these, 384 were civilian workers, 1,170 were enlisted workers and 1,142 were Algerians and colonials. The others were managers, engineers and technicians. After the war production of gunpowder for use in the mines expanded, and production of \\"Yonckite\\" and Favier explosives began. There was an explosion on 7 July 1920, after which the manufacture of chlorate explosives was reorganized. Between 1920 and 1938 the number of employees and workers varied from 407 to 530. By 1928 the site had been expanded through land purchases to . A decree of 23 September 1934 classified the mill as being used for storage, handling and manufacture of powders, ammunition, fireworks and explosives, and defined a polygon of isolation around it. Louis Jean Charles Maurel was the chief engineer at Vonges at the outbreak of World War II until June 1940. He later joined the Arm√©e secr√®te (AS), was arrested in October 1943 and was shot in February 1944. During World War II (1939-45) German troops entered Vonges on 15 June 1940, and the French retreated to Toulouse. Italian aircraft bombed the facility on 16 June 1940 and destroyed the General Service buildings. The personnel returned from Toulouse in August 1940. Production of explosives and gunpowder resumed in October 1940 at a reduced level, since the powder mill could not supply customers in the unoccupied zone of France. Delivery wagons were requisitioned by the German authorities, preventing deliveries, and the growth of stocks raised the risk of explosions. After December 1940 the Germans took control of the facility and authorized deliveries of powders and explosives to the mines. Starting in 1943 the operation was severely affected by workers being requisitioned to work in Germany, and others leaving the powder mill to avoid being sent to Germany. The number of workers dropped from 311 to 174, and output dropped correspondingly. After the Liberation of France the personnel were purged before production was restarted. Later developments View from the sports facility In the 1950s the French powder mills expanded their exports. In 1957 the Vonges facility covered , of which were wooded. In the late 1960s there were 500 employees producing gunpowder and nitrate and chlorate explosives. Around this time the mill diversified into producing composite materials and industrial paint. A decree of 19 March 1963 extended the polygon of isolation. The powder mill included a medical service, a social service and a school for apprentices. On 28 February 1970 as part of a reform of the Powder Department the Esquerdes Powder Mill in the Pas de Calais was closed and annexed to the Vonges Powder Mill. In 1971 the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Poudres et Explosifs (SNPE) took over all the manufacturing and sales of the government's powder department, including the Vonges Powder Mill, which continued to manufacture gunpowder and industrial explosives cartridges, as well as plastic parts for industrial use. The state was the majority shareholder in the SNPE. In 1995 Nobel explosifs France was created as a subsidiary of SNPE. In 2008 this subsidiary was merged with the private company Titanite to create Titanobel, now fully private. As of 2012 the Vonges Power Mill was operated by Titanobel. Titanobel SAS manufactures and markets explosives in France and abroad for use in mines, quarries and other works. A decree of 1 July 2013 repealed the decrees of 1934 and 1963 that defined the site's use and its polygons of isolation.

This was based on the claim by the Conservative government that it undermined national security. It sparked a dispute which became a cause c√©l√®bre, one of the most important trade union issues of the 1980s and the second longest continuously fought dispute in British trade union history. History In 1981, a series of strikes in Whitehall over pay led to industrial action at Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) intelligence 'listening centre' network based in Cheltenham. Following the expression of concern by US spymasters, trade unionism was banned at GCHQ (which monitors radio communications around the world as a part of an Anglo- American intelligence agreement). The US security agency used its diplomatic influence to secure the union ban. Margaret Thatcher claimed industrial action at the base, particularly during the 1981 civil service pay strike, had undermined the nation's security and justified the ban. Enforcement of the ban On 25 January 1984, during the Second Thatcher ministry, Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe announced in the House of Commons that trade unionism was no longer acceptable at GCHQ. The TUC, CCSU, the leaders of all opposition parties, and MPs from all parties reacted with indignant anger at this declaration. On 1 March 1984, the ban took effect and all GCHQ workers were ordered to leave their trade unions by 1 March 1984 and receive ¬£1,000 (less tax) or face dismissal. Access to industrial tribunals was also banned. 130 GCHQ workers refused to sign away their union rights but the last 14 workers who were still holding out were not dismissed by the government until early 1989. Fourteen GCHQ employees led by Mike Grindley refused to give up union membership and were dismissed on the order of the Conservative government after refusing to relinquish union membership in exchange for ¬£1,000. The GCHQ Staff Federation was an organisation created in the absence of orthodox unions. The first four sackings, in November 1988, were followed by ten more during December and into the spring of 1989. The fourteen employees were thirteen men and one woman. They included Mandarin Chinese linguist Mike Grindley, executive officer Graham Hughes, telecommunications technician Brian Johnson and radio officer Alan Rowland (dismissed 18 November 1988), Robin Smith (dismissed 29 November 1988), electronics specialist Gerry O'Hagan (dismissed 5 December 1988), Dee Goddard (dismissed 12 January 1989), Margaret O'Hagan, Allan Chambers, Bill Bickham, cypher co-ordinator John Cook, radio officer Harry Underwood and Roy Taylor (dismissed 22 February 1989), and executive officer Gareth Morris (dismissed 2 March 1989). Only Gareth Morris and Alan Rowland made it back into mainstream employment. Aftermath The issue became one of the most important trade union issues of the 1980s. Trade unions said the ban was a breach of civil liberties. Mass protests followed and a number of mass national one-day strikes were held to protest this decision, seen as a first step to wider bans on trade unions. This led to the long-running campaign organised to restore the unions by the civil service unions and the Trades Union Congress (TUC), which united all members in anger at the accusation that people belonging to unions could not be relied upon to be loyal to their own country. The Labour Party supported the campaign and made a commitment to full union rights at GCHQ. National Union of Civil and Public Servants banner during a march in Cheltenham in 1992 Thousands of people marched through Cheltenham every January on the anniversary of the ban and there were a series of twelve annual union rallies in Cheltenham. Issues of the campaign journal Warning Signal were published and media interviews were given. Trade union and party political conferences were addressed and branch meetings, trades councils, rallies and seminars, and MPs were regularly lobbied. The sacked workers travelled the country addressing conferences and meetings, trades councils and rallies. Len Murray, then General Secretary of the TUC, waded into negotiations alongside civil service unions, making a deal with the Cabinet Secretary Robert Armstrong which allowed members to keep their cards, in exchange for the unions agreeing not to interfere with GCHQ. Margaret Thatcher, believing they faced a conflict of loyalty, decided to tear up the agreement. The unions pursued legal arguments in British and international courts and appeals to British courts and the European Commission of Human Rights were unsuccessful. The government offered a sum of money to each employee who agreed to give up their union membership. Appeal to the International Labour Organization (ILO) resulted in a decision that government's actions were in violation of Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention. para. IV Grindley blocked any compromise by national union leaders with more amenable ministers and insisted that essential services have always been maintained during industrial action ‚Äì a contention supported by Sir John Nott, the then secretary of state for defence, who said the industrial action had \\"not in any way affected operational capability\\". By 1997, the campaigning 'Roadshow' had covered over 150,000 miles, attended over 350 events and raised a large amount of money for the cause. Every January there was a support rally in Cheltenham with top- level political and TUC speakers, each march through the town led by the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), Frickley Colliery Brass Band, or the GMB Glasgow pipe band. Abolition of the ban On 13 May 1997, the new Labour government allowed staff at GCHQ to join trade unions and offered Grindley and his former colleagues re-employment at the GCHQ intelligence network based in Cheltenham. Three of the fourteen dismissed workers resumed their careers at GCHQ, the others declined re-employment due to retirement or because they have embarked on other careers. The Government Communications Group of the Public Services, Tax and Commerce Union (PTC) merged with the Civil and Public Services Association (CPSA) to form the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) to represent interested employees at all grades. in March 1998. Foreign Secretary Robin Cook announced the government was lifting the ban on trade unions at GCHQ as part of the debate on the Queen's Speech for the government's commitment to \\"open and fair relations\\" in the workplace. He added: \\"As part of that commitment I want today to right a long-standing wrong. Since 1984, we have been pledged to restore normal trade union rights to the staff of GCHQ.\\" The Conservative Party's chief whip Alastair Goodlad said the decision had \\"potential implications for national security...\\" Trades Union Congress (TUC) general secretary John Monks said the lifting of the ban would be widely welcomed: \\"The ban has always been a blot on Britain's reputation for democracy and human rights. The previous government's belief that free trade unionism compromised national security was always an unjustified slur against the trade union movement and GCHQ staff in particular.\\" Civil and Public Services Association general secretary Barry Reamsbottom said: \\"We have waited 13 long years for this dark stain on our democratic society to be removed.\\" TUC former general secretary Brendan Barber said: \\"Of all the 1980s government attacks on trade unions, the GCHQ ban was the most spiteful...\\" Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) Deputy general secretary Hugh Lanning said: \\"The successful restoration of trade union rights, jobs, and pensions in 1997, was a huge achievement following a long-running campaign, and we now have a thriving organisation in GCHQ.\\" Mike Grindley said: \\"It's been a mixture of tenseness, tiredness, excitement and endurance. We always knew in our heart of hearts that we would win our rights back, but if we had been told it would take 13 years, the prospect would have been daunting indeed.\\" In February 2000, the government announced the sacked GCHQ employees shared a payout of up to ¬£550,000 after tax to compensate for lost earnings and pension rights. Public and Commercial Services union joint general secretary Barry Reamsbottom said: \\"We are delighted that this has finally been settled and that the fourteen members will have suffered no long term financial loss for sticking by their principles.\\" By this time out of the fourteen, eight had retired, three had returned to GCHQ, and three had taken jobs elsewhere. The ban was the second longest continuously fought dispute in British trade union history.

They were the first race riots in the history of the city. The riots were spurred by the imprisonment of Thornton and Rutha Blackburn, an African- American couple that had escaped slavery in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1831. They were caught by slave catchers, thrown in jail, and sentenced to be returned to their owners in Kentucky. This ruling angered the African-American population of Detroit. Rutha Blackburn was smuggled out by two African- American women, and the following day, a mob formed outside the jail, demanding the release of Thornton. Refusal was met with violence as the mob stormed the jail, beating the authorities and taking Thornton. Thornton was transported to Canada where he was reunited with Rutha. The rioting continued in Detroit into July. White Detroiters, angered by the escape of the Blackburns, retaliated by assaulting African Americans in the street and burning many of their buildings. The rioting came to a climax as the jail and adjacent stables were set aflame on July 11 and 15. The mayor was forced to bring in troops to restore order to the city on July 30. Following the riots, a set of city-wide ordinances were issued, including a mandated bond payment of $500 for every African-American resident. This caused a majority of the African-American population of Detroit to relocate to Canada.  History  Thornton and Rutha Blackburn lived as slaves in Louisville, Kentucky during the early 1800s. The early 1800s was a volatile time for slavery in the United States. Practices and attitudes about slavery were changing and highly controversial between the northern and southern states. During the 1700s, slave owners of the South claimed that slavery was a positive thing, and claimed to care for their slaves as they tried not to separate them from their families when selling them. However, the invention of the cotton gin in 1793 caused the slave industry to skyrocket, and border states like Kentucky and Maryland could make a lot of money by shipping surplus slaves down South where slavery was growing. This promoted the practice of selling slaves, and slave owners no longer avoided separating slaves from their loved ones. Due to the increased risk of being separated from their families, slave flight to the North became popular during this time. Among those threatened by separation were Thornton and Rutha Blackburn. The couple, though slaves owned by different people, were married in Louisville in 1831. A few months after their marriage, Rutha was sold to another slave owner. Before she could be shipped off, however, Rutha fled Kentucky with her husband on July 3, 1831. The two settled down in the free, northern city of Detroit, Michigan. That fall, a white man from Louisville named Thomas J. Rogers visited Detroit. He ran into Thornton Blackburn and recognized him as a slave who had fled his town a few months prior. Thornton, on the other hand, did not recognize him, and the two struck up a conversation, in which Rogers found out that another escaped slave, Rutha Blackburn, was living with him. For unknown reasons, Rogers waited two years, until the summer of 1833, to report the slaves‚Äô whereabouts to the Kentucky authorities. When the Blackburns' owners were notified, they hired slavecatchers to capture them. The couple was arrested and put in the Detroit jail. A hearing was held on June 15, in which they were found guilty under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 and sentenced to be shipped back to their owners in Kentucky on June 17.  Event  News of the Blackburns‚Äô fate traveled fast throughout Detroit, angering the African-American community. Two African-American women, Tabitha Lightfoot and Caroline French, friends of Rutha Blackburn, went to the jail and asked if they could see Rutha one last time. Once inside, Rutha and French traded places and Lightfoot walked out of the jail with Rutha, disguised as French. Later, when this was discovered, French was told she would have to permanently take Rutha's place to compensate for the loss of a female slave. French, however, was released from the jail later that day. The next day, 17 June 1833, a large, armed mob gathered outside the jail, demanding that the sheriff release Thornton Blackburn. The number of protesters ranges from 40 to 400, according to different accounts. The sheriff, John M. Wilson, attempted three times to reason with the mob. On the third try, he brought Thornton out to calm the crowd. On Thornton's emergence from the jail, he was slipped a pistol and pointed it at the jailer, threatening to shoot. The sheriff then lunged at Thornton and the two fought for the gun. This provoked the mob to storm the jail, attacking the sheriff, the jailer, the deputy, and the guards. The sheriff was fatally injured by an unknown assailant. During the confusion, Thornton was smuggled from the jail and delivered to a boat which took him and many of his supporters to Canada, where he would join his wife. The conflict did not cease in Detroit once the Blackburns were rescued, however. White Detroiters were outraged by the Thornton's escape and joined in on the rioting. They assaulted African- American men and women in the streets and burned down over 40 buildings belonging to African Americans. The protest began as an effort to save the Blackburns, but it turned into a city-wide racial riot. The Blackburn riots are said to be the first race riots in Detroit's history. During this time, 29 people were arrested for unlawful assembly. Hearings were held on June 21 and June 22, though some arrested and tried were white, the 11 that were convicted were all African American. The struggle continued into July as a march was organized to demand the release of the jailed protesters who had not been charged of any crimes. On July 11, the jail was set on fire, but it was quickly extinguished. On July 15 the stables next to the jail were all burned down, causing $150 of damage. Following the stable fire, the mayor of Detroit, mayor Chapin, wrote the U.S. Secretary of War, Lewis Cass, and requested that troops from Fort Gratiot be brought into the city to restore order. The troops arrived on July 30 and enforced martial law, effectively putting an end to the riots.  Outcomes for Detroit  With the rioting dispersed, Mayor Chapin, with the advice from the Detroit city council, issued several city-wide rulings. All African-American citizens were obligated to carry a lantern at night to make themselves visible to white citizens. A 9:00 pm curfew was set, and a night watch was established to patrol the river. All boats coming to Detroit from Canada were stopped. Those imprisoned were sentenced to work in a street repair gang to undo the damage from the riots. The Michigan law of 1827 was reinforced, \\"requiring blacks to register and post bond with the clerk of the county court\\". This meant that all African-American residents of Detroit who could not prove their freedom were to be expelled from the city. It also required a bond payment of $500. This ruling resulted in the emigration of the majority of the African-American population of Detroit to Canada.  Outcomes for the Blackburns  Upon arriving in Canada, Thornton and Rutha Blackburn were arrested and put in jail in Sandwich, Windsor, Ontario. Michigan officials tried twice to get them extradited but Upper Canada had just passed an act concerning the capture and extradition of ‚Äúfugitive offenders from foreign countries‚Äù that allowed Lieutenant Governor John Colburne to refuse their extradition. This law affirmed that ‚Äúfugitive slaves could not be extradited to the United States if they had not committed a crime that was punishable under Canadian law‚Äù. The Blackburns had not committed a Canadian crime because slavery had just been made illegal by the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833. The principal of this action was that Canada would not return slaves to their masters in the United States no matter what they had done. This established Canada as a safe terminus for the Underground Railroad. The Blackburn case was the first to be decided under that law. The Blackburns were released from jail, spent some time in Amherstburg, and then permanently relocated to Toronto in 1834.

Early life  Baird and her twin sister Anna were born to a working class household in Rutherglen in 1925. Baird's middle name, Ian, was on account of the fact that her father, John (a janitor at Bankhead Primary School) had been expecting a boy. Her brother, Archie Baird, was a noted footballer for Aberdeen and Scotland in addition to being an escapee from a German prisoner-of-war camp. The two sisters attended Rutherglen Academy where Baird's desire to become a journalist was well known. Her Latin teacher mentioned the fact to a senior member of staff at The Sunday Post newspaper during a chance meeting. Baird was invited to submit a piece of writing which she submitted in a journalistic style and was rewarded with her first job in journalism as a result.  Career  Baird began her career as a journalist aged seventeen working for The Sunday Post in the nineteen forties before eventually being headhunted in 1947 by the Scottish Daily Express,, the biggest selling daily newspaper of the time. Her big scoop came in October that year when she visited Birkhall in Deeside where Queen Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh were honeymooning. Though expecting to be turned away, Baird was surprised to be invited inside and was therefore able to give her readers an exclusive glimpse inside their honeymoon suite during a period of high interest in the newlyweds. It was also while working at the Scottish Daily Express that she met her future husband, the writer and presenter Magnus Magnusson. The couple married in 1954 and enjoyed the joke that he had only married her to get her job since he had been four years her junior at the paper. Taking maternity leave in the years that followed only paused her writing temporarily. Roger Wood, editor of the Express, visited Baird and urged her to continue to write columns for the paper where she had established herself. Baird continued to work as a freelance writer whilst bringing up the couple's children and it was not unknown for her to do half the researching and writing on books commissioned to her husband. Her own commissions, a history of the Women's Guild and a history of the Scottish Mutual Assurance Society were both well-received and she was a regular after dinner speaker for the Scottish Literary Agency.  Personal life  The family moved from Garrowhill to Balmore as it grew in size with a total of five offspring: Sally, Margaret, Anna, Jon and Siggy. Pre-deceased by husband Magnus and son Siggy, Mamie died on 12 April 2012, after suffering from dementia for eight years. She was eighty-six. Her eldest daughter, the broadcaster Sally Magnusson, has since written a memoir, Where Memories Go: Why Dementia Changes Everything.  Legacy  In 1982, The Glasgow Herald columnist, Jack Webster wrote of Baird: > ‚ÄúHer secret springs from a wonderfully observant eye... She stood in her own > right as Mamie Baird, one of the finest journalists of her day.‚Äù  Bibliography  * Out of Silence: The Women's Guild (1887‚Äì1987) * A Length of Days:The Scottish Mutual Assurance Society (1883‚Äì1983)  References   External links  # Photograph album of Mamie Baird on the BBC website. # Interview with Sally Magnusson on her mother on the BBC Radio 4 website. 1925 births 2012 deaths People from Rutherglen People educated at Rutherglen Academy Scottish women writers British women journalists Daily Express people Scottish journalists Twin people from Scotland ","title":"Mamie Magnusson"},{"id":"55105479","text":"Frederick X. \\"Rick\\" Gibbons is an American psychologist who has been a professor of psychology at the University of Connecticut since August 2012.

The remains, most of which were centered around a shallow grave, were identified as belonging to a woman between the ages of 40 and 55 with a seriously arthritic knee. Due to holes and cuts on her bra, and similar cutting marks on the bones, investigators ruled that the unidentified decedent had been stabbed to death. Dental records and the arthritic knee soon led the body to be identified as that of Judy Smith (born Judith Eldredge December 15, 1946, in Hyannis, Massachusetts), a 50-year-old nurse from Newton, Massachusetts, who had last been positively seen alive by her husband Jeffrey at a hotel in Philadelphia almost five months earlier. When she had not shown up after a day purportedly spent sightseeing in the city, he had reported her missing. Until the bones were found, the search for her had been concentrated in the Philadelphia area, where several sightings had been reported, although some of them may have been of a homeless woman who strongly resembled Smith. The investigation into the killing has been complicated by the unresolved question of how Smith got to North Carolina from Philadelphia, away, in the first place. She and her husband planned to stay in the Philadelphia area and visit friends after the conference he was attending ended; she had not expressed any desire to visit the Asheville area where her body was found. Yet when found she was wearing clothes more appropriate for hiking than those she had on when last seen in Philadelphia. It has been speculated that she might have been a victim of serial killer Gary Michael Hilton, who had left one of his victims in a similar condition near where Smith's body was discovered. Philadelphia police initially considered Jeffrey Smith a suspect, casting doubt on the idea that his wife had even been to the city in the first place and suggesting his story was fabricated. Later, however, the unlikelihood that he could have disposed of her body where it was found due to severe health problems ruled him out; he died in 2005. The Philadelphia police, the FBI, and the Buncombe County sheriff's office continue to investigate; the case has been the subject of a segment on Unsolved Mysteries. Background Judy Bradford (her name from her second marriage), a home care nurse in the Boston area, met Jeffrey Smith, a lawyer, when she cared for Smith's father for a week following the latter's throat surgery in the mid-1980s. Jeffrey later recalled Judy's devotion to his father's care, using a window curtain rod to hold an IV bag his father needed dripped into him, in the absence of a proper holder. Jeffrey, a divorc√© with a grown daughter, began dating Judy, who also had two adult children from a previous marriage, and in September 1996 the two wed. Jeffrey's work as a lawyer was also related to health care; he represented the Northeast Pharmaceutical Conference, an organization of researchers and executives primarily from New England. Eight months after their marriage, the couple planned their first trip together, attending a conference in Philadelphia from April 9‚Äì11, 1997. Following that they planned to spend the rest of the week visiting friends in nearby New Jersey. Disappearance When the couple came to Logan International Airport on April 9, 1997, to check in for their flight to Philadelphia, Judy suddenly realized that she had forgotten to bring her driver's license. New FAA regulations at the time required that airlines verify passengers' identities before allowing them to fly. Judy told her husband she would return to their home to get it and then take a later flight; that evening she caught up to him in the lobby of the DoubleTree hotel in Center City Philadelphia where the conference was being held, apologizing for her mistake and bringing flowers. The next morning Jeffrey awoke before his wife and went downstairs to get breakfast. He returned to the room afterwards and found her awake, in the shower. He told her the breakfast was exceptional and that she should have it for herself. She joked in response that she should just go down as she was at the time, naked. Jeffrey left for the day's first session. The night before, the couple had agreed that Judy, who was making her first visit to Philadelphia, would go visit the city's tourist attractions such as Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell, and then reunite at the hotel at the end of the day for the conference's cocktail party at 6 p.m.. When Jeffrey finished moderating the last of the day's sessions, he returned to their room. Judy was not there. He assumed she had returned, changed, and gone down to the party ahead of him, perhaps having gotten confused about their plans. When he went downstairs to check on this, however, she was not there. After going back and forth between the party and the room several times, he grew concerned and informed a concierge, who began calling area hospitals. There were many reasons why Judy might have been delayed, Jeffrey knew. She would not have thought twice to have helped a stranger in need, as she had helped a sick passenger suffering from AIDS on another flight the year before. But if she did something like that, she usually called or tried to let someone know. Jeffrey left the cocktail party and paid a cab driver to slowly follow the route of the Philadelphia PHLASH tourist bus, which Judy had told him she was planning to use, for any sign of her. He called his stepchildren in Boston and asked one of them to go to their house and check their answering machines for any messages. None of those options yielded any useful information. Finally he went to the Philadelphia police around midnight to report Judy missing. Investigation The Philadelphia police told Jeffrey that he could not file a missing person report until 24 hours after he had last seen Judy. He recalls that a detective said that if he wanted to \\"push it\\", he could file his report in the morning. After spending the remainder of the night sleepless in his hotel room, he did. Before Jeffrey did, however, he talked to Philadelphia mayor Ed Rendell and John Perzel, a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from the city, who were both attending the conference, about what he felt was the police's dismissive attitude to his complaint. He said later that he believed those conversations had made a difference, as when he returned to the police station to make his report, two detectives were waiting to take it and he was treated with courtesy and respect; he said he even overheard one saying on the telephone that Commissioner Richard Neal was to receive a copy of the report. Nevertheless, Jeffrey said several months later that there was some resistance. One detective, he claimed, was still saying four days later that he thought Judy had just had a midlife crisis and had done this just for the attention; the detective later repeated that speculation, with some qualification, to The Boston Globe. Jeffrey also believed the police, while cooperative overall, seemed to be inordinately focused on him as a suspect. \\"When you look at the statistics, 85 to 90 percent of females [who are murdered] are killed by someone very close to them: a family member, spouse, boyfriend\\", police captain John McGinnis explained later. \\"Statistically, we have to look at Jeffrey Smith as a suspect, until it's proven that he is not a suspect\\". While Jeffrey understood and cooperated when they asked to interview his stepdaughter without him present, since she told the police he \\"[didn't] cheat on his taxes\\", he was distressed that they expressed doubt that Judy had ever been in Philadelphia to begin with. If, they asked, Judy was the experienced traveler who had once gone to Thailand on her own to visit the family of a grateful patient, why had she forgotten her driver's license? Jeffrey later explained in response to the Philadelphia City Paper that the rule had only been in effect for 18 months and Judy had only flown once during that time, so it was entirely possible that she made an honest mistake. According to police, only one other witness, a desk clerk, could corroborate him on having seen Judy at the hotel, which did not have a guest register, until another conference attendee recalled in August that he had seen her in the lobby when she arrived (even so, police were still cautious since he did not know Judy personally). A female detective who searched the Smiths' hotel room said it struck her as unusual that the clothes Judy left behind did not appear to have been worn at all, suggesting she had worn the same clothes both on her flight from Boston and the day she disappeared; nor did she appear to have brought any cosmetics. But her daughter said that was typical travel behavior for her mother. The police also made much of what they asserted was Jeffrey's refusal to take a lie detector test. He says he never refused; he only insisted that any such test be administered by the FBI and that if he passed, the police formally request that the bureau assist with its investigation. But according to McGinnis, at the time he made that demand Jeffrey already knew the FBI would not join the investigation, and still declined to submit to the test even when the Philadelphia police arranged for it to be administered by the Massachusetts State Police. \\"Certain conditions were met, but as far as I'm concerned he refused\\", said deputy commissioner Richard Zappile. Possible sightings In the days after Judy disappeared, Philadelphia newspapers and television ran stories about the case. Jeffrey and friends and family put up flyers with her picture seeking information. These led to reports of sightings, some of which Jeffrey found credible. Most were in the city, but later reports came from outside the city. A number of reports described a woman who matched Judy's description but appeared to have psychological issues. She was described by staff at the Society Hill Hotel as their \\"weirdo of the week\\" when she stayed there between April 13 and 15, signing in as \\"H.K. Rich/Collins\\". While there she masturbated in front of an open window, spoke to herself in tongues, and then loudly claimed \\"the emperor\\" would wire her money when she needed it to extend her stay. Another report mentioned a woman at the junction of Broad and Locust Streets around 3 p.m. on the day Judy was last seen, describing the woman as \\"disoriented\\". There were some other reports of a similar woman, also apparently disturbed, in the Penn's Landing neighborhood, a PHLASH stop and popular tourist attraction as well. But both the police and the family believe that those who saw her confused Judy with a homeless woman in the area who strongly resembled her, so much that even Judy's son thought the woman was his mother when he saw her from across the street. However, one other homeless man in Penn's Landing, when shown Judy's picture, insisted he had seen her and not the other homeless woman, sleeping on a bench next to him the night before. On April 15, he told the family that they had just missed this woman, but they were unable to locate her in the vicinity. The family believed this was significant because it was the last time anyone had identified Judy based on seeing her picture. Sightings that seemed a more positive identification were centered around the PHLASH bus and its route. A hotel employee said she had asked later on the morning of April 10 where she could catch the bus nearby; a driver said he had picked her up at Front and South Streets early in the afternoon and may have let her off near the hotel. She was also reportedly seen entering and leaving the city's Greyhound bus terminal, possibly to use the bathroom, her family believes. The terminal is near Philadelphia's Chinatown, and since Judy loved Chinese and Thai food she might have gone there to eat; however, no one at any of the many restaurants in the neighborhood recalled her. Another report surfaced that Judy had been seen shopping for dresses at Macy's in the Deptford Mall in Deptford, New Jersey, across the Delaware River. She could have gotten there, they realized, via NJ Transit Bus Route 400, which makes hourly runs to the mall from Market Street in Center City and the intersection of Broad and Cherry Streets. A salesperson and customer at Macy's gave an account of the actions of a woman there who may have been Judy, saying she had said she was shopping for her daughter even though her daughter often disliked what she bought her‚Äîwhich rang true to her family‚Äîand giving a description that included the distinctive red backpack she carried almost everywhere, especially when traveling. As the woman left, they recalled, she had tried to get a younger woman, whom they assumed at the time was the woman's daughter, to leave with her. There were also reports that she had been seen in Easton, north of Philadelphia, a few days after going missing. Jeffrey Smith finds another report from Philadelphia \\"more credible.\\" A private investigator he had hired told a reporter that later in the week a man told Smith he had been leaving a Wawa near Rittenhouse Square on his way to work just before 6 a.m. when he saw \\"a well-dressed white woman\\" sitting outside a nearby gourmet grocery store, a sight he found unusual for that time of day. Later he saw a newspaper article on the case and realized the woman looked a lot like Judy. Discovery of body Jeffrey hired two other private investigators to look for his wife, and faxed and mailed copies of his wife's missing person flier to hospitals all over the country, asking them to look for her. Eventually those efforts helped locate her before the end of the year. However, she was not alive. On September 7, 1997, a father and son hunting for deer out of season on a hillside in an area of North Carolina's Pisgah National Forest found what appeared to be human bones near the Stoney Fork picnic area along Chestnut Creek, just from Asheville. The bones had been scattered around an area in diameter, likely by animals. At the center was a shallow grave where the majority of the skeleton remained, still partially buried and clothed. Some personal effects were found in the area as well. The lead investigator on the case put aside his convalescence from recent back surgery to scour the area for evidence; he crushed his sciatic nerve as a result, requiring further surgery. The state medical examiner determined that the bones of the then unidentified decedent were those of a white woman between the ages of 40 and 55. She had had extensive dental work and suffered from severe arthritis in her left knee. There were cutting marks on her ribs, and among the clothing recovered from the scene was her bra, which also had cuts and punctures. The investigation concluded that she been fatally stabbed, and her death was officially classified as a homicide. The remains did not remain unidentified for long. An emergency room physician in Franklin, North Carolina, west of Asheville, saw an article about the discovery in the newspaper. He connected it to one of the fliers Jeffrey had sent out, and faxed a copy of the article to the Philadelphia police. A detective there asked Jeffrey for his wife's dental records, which he provided; they were then sent to the medical examiner in Asheville. The records matched the dental work on the bones discovered earlier in the month, and by the end of September the remains were positively identified as those of Judy Smith. While the discovery of Judy's remains ended the missing person investigation, the homicide investigation it started posed new questions for detectives with the Buncombe County Sheriff's Office, which took the lead role. In order to identify her killer, they would probably need to figure out how she got to North Carolina in the first place. The evidence found with her bones suggested that she had been with someone else, possibly whoever killed her, and that she had been alive when she reached the Asheville area. Most significantly, her leg bones were still clad in jeans, thermal underwear, and hiking boots. These were not the clothes she was wearing when Jeffrey or any of the other witnesses who might have seen her in Philadelphia saw her, but they were what she might have worn while hiking in the mountains around Asheville in mid-April. No wallet or other identification was found in her pockets. A blue and black vinyl backpack was found with the body; in it were winter clothes and $80 in cash. A shirt buried nearby also had $87 in the pockets. The combined $167 is consistent with the $200 Jeffrey believed Judy to have had on her at the time of her disappearance; the presence of the money and her wedding ring have led investigators to conclude that robbery was not the motivation for her killing. However, her red backpack was not found, nor other clothes she was wearing when last seen. Judy's family also said that an expensive pair of sunglasses found near the bones were not hers as far as they knew. Judy's family could not imagine why she might have gone to the Asheville area. According to them, she never expressed any desire to go there, and had only twice been to that general region of the country. Once she had visited Jeffrey for a week when he was at a weight loss clinic in Raleigh‚ÄìDurham; on another occasion she had accompanied a patient on a drive south as he visited family that either lived closer in North Carolina to Asheville or in a neighboring area of Virginia or Tennessee (the family's memories differ). Sightings in Asheville area Several people in the Asheville area recalled having seen Judy, or a woman matching her description, in April. A clerk at a local retailer said: \\"She seemed very alert to me. She was very pleasant. I didn't see anything about her that would indicate that she wasn't right in any way\\". The woman she talked to said her husband was an attorney from Boston, attending a conference in Philadelphia, and during that time she had just decided to go to the Asheville area. An employee at the Biltmore Estate also recalls seeing Judy. At a campground near where her body was found, the owner recalls that she drove up in a gray sedan filled with boxes and bags, asked if she could spend the night there in her car, and drove away after learning she could not. A deli owner in the same area told the Philadelphia City Paper that Judy came up to her store in a gray sedan and bought $30 worth of sandwiches and a toy truck. Local investigators consider these sightings credible. Theories Investigators with the Buncombe County sheriff's office have ruled out Jeffrey Smith, who died in 2005, as a suspect, since as he was morbidly obese they believe he would have been physically unable to have taken his wife's body up the slope to where it was found. His presence at the conference during the day Judy disappeared has also been corroborated. The Philadelphia police, however, never completely eliminated him as a suspect. Sam Constance, the Buncombe detective who investigated the case, believes Judy was not abducted and came to the Asheville area voluntarily. He wanted to determine how and why in 1997 when interviewed. Constance also did not believe Judy was killed elsewhere and dumped at the site, due to the distance anyone, even someone in the best physical condition, would have had to carry her body to dispose of it there. Judy may even have planned to disappear for a while, or perhaps even permanently. While Jeffrey and her children did not say there had been any problems in the marriage, one of her friends said otherwise. \\"At the time this happened, Jeff and Judy's marriage was very tenuous\\", Carolyn Dickey told Unsolved Mysteries in 2001. \\"I believe that something did happen that triggered her to want to have some time away from Jeff\\". Although some of Judy's jewelry was missing, the presence of most of it and the cash suggests that robbery was not a motive for the killing. It has also been suggested that she might have encountered a local serial killer who had less than a year earlier left the raped and murdered body of one of his victims tied to a tree not far away. However, that killer, Gary Michael Hilton, was later arrested and convicted of that crime as well as several other killings on hiking trails in national forests in the southern Appalachian Mountains during the 2000s, and has not been linked to Smith's killing. The state of North Carolina and Jeffrey combined to offer $17,000 in reward money for any information leading to the resolution of the case.

He later rose to the rank of Brigadier General in the New Jersey state militia. In 1816 when his eldest brother Henry committed suicide, he became Postmaster of Paterson, a position he would hold until 1829, and briefly again before his death in 1849. In 1821, he was elected to the New Jersey General Assembly, of which he served until 1832. In November 1840, Abraham was tasked to take the New Jersey votes to Washington, D.C. for the Presidential Election. Personal life He is the son of Abraham Godwin, Grandson of Captain Abraham Godwin, Husband of Martha Parke & father of three sons. His eldest was famous Parke Godwin, his second son Henry was a lawyer in Binghamton, New York, and disappeared in the Civil War, and the youngest son Abraham, was a house painter, captured at The Battle of Wilderness and died a prisoner of the Confederacy in Andersonville, Georgia. At the Godwin Hotel on the Passaic in 1828 he created Passaic County. He was elected an officer for the State of New Jersey at the New York Convention on October 26, 1831. He lived in the house his grandfather built and his grandmother Phebe turned into a Tavern known as the 'Widow Godwin Tavern', right down the street from the Passaic Hotel/Godwin Tavern. An old resident of Paterson recalls back to their youth about their memories of Abraham as the Postmaster: > It was a very fine coach, hung on straps, and comfortable to ride in. It had > room inside for nine, and two more passengers could be accommodated on top. > A rack for trunks and packages was fixed behind. it bowled along the > turnpike drawn by four speedy horses. this was all before the railroads > came. The driver was a man of pleasant address, and well thought of by all. > How proud we boys were to grab up the mail bag when he threw it down in > front of the tavern and run with it across to the postoffice, where its > contents were emptied and sorted.

I remember his being helped down > from the seat one winter's day, when the thermometer was said to have been > eighteen below. He commanded the martial music at his father's funeral and Revolutionary War hero William Colfax's funeral in 1838. He inherited his fathers epaulets. In 1820 Abraham became partners with Thomas Rogers and went into business running a cotton mill. They leased several mills over the years and worked together until 1830 when Thomas Rogers decided to go on his own. Soon after he founded the Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works. On 2 March 1831 books to receive stock in the \\"Paterson and Hudson River Valley Railroad Company\\" were commissioned by Abraham at the Godwin Hotel, which was being run by Abraham's sister Maria and her husband Henry Post. This railroad would go on to split Godwin Avenue in two, creating Godwin Street. Death Abraham died in the Widow Godwin Tavern on August 18, 1849, from tuberculosis, and was buried in Cedar Lawn Cemetery in Paterson, New Jersey. He and his wife's gravestones were tipped over. Abraham's was split in half. In 2017, the stones were returned upright and fixed with cement.

He is most known as the first African-American elected to public office in Worcester County, Maryland. Prior to his election he was one of the lead plaintiffs, along with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in a voting rights lawsuit to end at-large voting and create a majority \\"minority\\" voting district in Worcester County, Maryland. At the time, Purnell was President of the NAACP's Worcester County branch. Early life and education Purnell was born on July 26, 1937 in Berlin, Maryland on the black side of town known as Briddeltown, to Hulda McCray Purnell (1911-2000) and James Lee Purnell Sr. (1908-1994), a mill worker and dairy farmer. He is the oldest of eight children from his parents' marriage, followed by Edward L. Purnell, Patricia E. Purnell Hingleton, Gerald W. Purnell Sr., Benjamin H. Purnell Sr., Gilbert C. Purnell, Hennie M. Purnell Chase, and Bertha C. Purnell. He also has three older siblings from his parents' previous relationships: Joshua W. McCray, Osie Henry, and Virginia Purnell.O'Sullivan, Sean. \\"The History of a History Maker\\", The Daily Times, Salisbury, 5 December 1995. He is the cousin of American college basketball coach Oliver Purnell, and of the Honorable Gerald V. Purnell, the first African-American judge on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Before walking a mile to his primary school, his daily chores included milking the family's seventeen cows and delivering fresh milk with his father. At the all-black schools he attended, the students only had access to secondhand books from the white schools. The books frequently had marked-up, torn, and missing pages. Despite this, Purnell's grades were good through seventh grade. When his grades slipped, the principal and three teachers came to his parents' home to discuss them. Berlin was a segregated town with whites and blacks living on opposite sides of U.S. 113. Blacks who went uptown to shop had a designated parking area and only had access to one filthy bathroom. Two years in a row, he and his friends went to watch the Halloween parade in town and were chased back across the highway by white boys wielding bricks. Loitering on the sidewalks was prohibited. Around 1947, he and his sister Patricia were standing near the corner of Main and William Streets while waiting for their mother to complete her purchase at the shoe store. Berlin policeman Noah Hudson yelled at them, \\"N____, get off the street!\\" and then struck his sister in the stomach with his blackjack. His sister was age 7 at the time. Hudson apologized when their father confronted him, but still lost his job as James Lee Purnell Sr. pursued the incident with Hudson's superiors and town officials. James Jr. learned a valuable lesson about persistence and fighting for good. Despite the discouragement of others, Purnell applied for a job at Sunshine Laundry on the white side of town in 1953. They hired him on the spot, and as their first black employee, he worked there as an extractor until he graduated from Worcester High School in 1955. During his young adulthood, Purnell became a long distance truck driver. He married Clemeth Hardy on Christmas Day 1961.Morse, Joseph E. \\"Outstanding Achiever James L Purnell Jr\\", Maryland African American Pride Magazine, Salisbury, January/February 2007. In 1971, he began a successful drapery installation business with his wife during the condominium boom in the resort town of Ocean City, Maryland.Morse, Joseph E. \\"Worcester County Civic Leader James L Purnell\\", Shore Living Magazine, Salisbury, August 1995. In 1976, he also became a bus contractor for Worcester County Public Schools and continues as one. Social activism In 1981, Purnell and others in the black community of Berlin and the Worcester County NAACP went before the county's Board of Commissioners to request the closure of the landfill that was behind his parents' home and in the center of Briddeltown. Once believed to be temporary, the uncovered and untreated landfill created a stench on the black side of town. The Commissioners refused, but after the Maryland Board of Health became involved the landfill was closed nearly 4 years later. Since the landfill had been polluting their well water supplies, the black residents were also given access to the county's water system.O'Sullivan, Sean. \\"The History of a History Maker\\", The Daily Times, Salisbury, 5 December 1995. After becoming President of the Worcester County NAACP in 1986, he led the organization and black county residents to march along the Ocean City Boardwalk. The July 5, 1986 march was to draw attention to the lack of non-menial resort jobs for blacks and the lack of images of black families in its tourism advertisements.Canfora, Susan. \\"Purnell honored for role in community\\", Ocean Pines Independent, Ocean Pines, 3 May 2006. As their President, Purnell and the NAACP began to challenge the illegal voting practices of the county. Prior to this, only three African-Americans had run for the office of Commissioner in Worcester County, but all lost their bids.Meyer, Eugene L. \\"Tuesday May Be New Day For Blacks In Md. County\\", Washington Post,Washington, 4 November 1995. Retrieved on 1 September 2017. Together with the ACLU, Purnell was a plaintiff in a 1992 lawsuit stating that at-large voting discriminated against blacks.Morse, Joseph E. \\"Worcester County Voting Case Judge rules for Black District\\", Shore Living Magazine, Salisbury, August 1995. After multiple appeals by the Worcester County Board of Commissioners and the Supreme Court's refusal to hear the case, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered Worcester County on June 16, 1995 to abolish at-large voting, to create (at that time) the only majority \\"minority\\" voting district on the Eastern Shore, and to hold elections in November. The lawsuit and appeals had kept the county polls closed in 1994.Fisher, Tim. \\"Purnell Files for Commissioner\\", Maryland Times Press, Ocean City, 28 June 1995. The five Republican Commissioners accrued $800,000 in legal fees in their attempt to retain the old voting system. Worcester County was also liable for the $400,000 in legal fees due to the plaintiffs' legal team, the ACLU. With a looming July 3 deadline to file as a candidate, no other African-Americans stepped forward to run in the new minority District 3. Purnell resigned as NAACP President and announced his candidacy for County Commissioner on June 23, 1995. The 1995 election Worcester County's election for the 5-member Board of Commissioners was held November 7, 1995. Purnell narrowly defeated Republican incumbent Floyd Bassett. His win made him the first African-American elected to public office in Worcester County's 253-year history.Shaffer, Joshua. \\"Victory cause for celebration Purnell first black elected\\", Daily Times, Salisbury, 8 November 1995. Purnell remarked that day was both the \\"proudest and saddest\\" day of his life, because his father was not alive to witness it. He was sworn into office on December 3, 1995. Long-serving County Commissioner Purnell retained his seat as County Commissioner through five terms until he retired in 2014. During his time in office, his fellow Commissioners elected him their Vice- President from 1995 to 2005, and from 2010 to 2012.

He played as fullback. Career Born in Setagaya Ward, Tokyo. In 1971, Imazumi moved to Oita Prefecture and started to play rugby at the age of 6. At Maizuru High School, entering through Ichinami, Makoto Hida at the second grade (who later served captain at Meiji University and active at Kobe Steel) and he missed participation in the National High School Championship (At the end of 2015, Maizuru could not play at Hanazono) after the defeat against Oita Fishery High School. He also plays as number 8 and as flanker. After attending Waseda University, he was converted to wing by Kenji Kimoto, then switched to fullback, while active as a player for Waseda. When he kicked a goal kick, the stand shouts \\"1, 2, 3, 4, 5!\\", keeping with the pace of going backwards one and two steps slowly, which was the air that envelopes the whole stadium. Originally, it was the correct manner to keep the quiet the place during the penalty kick, but it was different for Imazumi. It was originally during a fiery competition, when the opponent fans attempted to disrupt his concentration, but it became a chant dedicated to Imazumi. After that, similar chants almost not seen. In the 4th grade, kicking a drop lessened, but during the penalty kick near the halfway line during the University Championship semi-finals against Doshisha University, when Imazumi stood at the kicking pont, the clapping took off from the whole audience, followed by the \\"1, 2, 3, 4, 5!\\" chant, shaking the nation. Imazumi kicked a splendid penalty kick and got the best cheers on that day. He showed a big play that no one anticipated on the big stage, such as a miraculous try leading to the same score from the last 12 points in the 1990 match against Meiji. In his four years studying in the university, Imazumi won the University Championship twice and won the Japanese Championship once. From the late 1980s to the early 1990s, he was a player deserving to be called a \\"senior boss\\" who contributed greatly to the popularity of Japanese rugby. It was hard to be difficult to understand, while he did not knew what to do, on the other hand, although he did not played for the Japanese national team, his talent was highly appreciated by Onishi Tetsunosuke. After graduating from university and studying abroad in New Zealand, Imazumi joined Suntory in 1994. The following year, he was called up in Japanese National team for the 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa, He also played for Japan sevens. In the 1995 Rugby World Cup, played in South Africa, he did not see action during the tournament. The leaders, who were interested in golf, criticized the disturbance in the management when Imazumi was appointed as backs coach for Amway. After the 2000 Japanese championship season, he retired, becoming, being appointed as coach for his alma mater, Waseda University RFC. In addition, he moved to subsidiary Suntoryfoods Sundelphis and assumed office as playing coach. In March 2005, Imazumi left Sundelphis (remaining the head coach in the rugby club) and went to Graduate School of Public Management at Waseda University.

It was formed in 2016 by John Haughm, Trevor Matthews, and Stephen Parker. Pillorian released their only full-length album, Obsidian Arc, on March 10, 2017. History Pillorian was formed early in the summer of 2016 with the stated goal of \\"[creating] a unique, sinister, and twisted style of dark/black metal\\". The word \\"pillorian\\" means \\"of or relating to scorn and condemnation\\". The band formed shortly after the breakup of Haughm's previous band, Agalloch. On February 10, 2017 Pillorian released their first single, \\"A Stygian Pyre\\". NPR described the titular song as \\"feral\\" and \\"bestial\\", but with \\"enormous\\" production values. One month later, on March 10, 2017 Pillorian released their first full studio album, Obsidian Arc. The album received mixed to positive reviews. Sputnik Music gave the album a rating of 5 out of 5, or \\"classic\\", and alluding to a lyric from one of Agalloch's songs, summarized its review by saying that \\"if this grand panorama before me is what you call god... then god is not dead.\\" Decibel magazine gave the album an 8/10 review, calling it \\"categorically black metal\\" and \\"darker, edgier and far more dissonant\\" than Haughm's previous work as the frontman of Agalloch. Metal Injection called the album a \\"somewhat promising start\\", but said that the album was too safe and that despite being good, \\"seldom [veers] towards being great\\". In February 2019, Matthews and Parker both left the band after Haughm made comments on Facebook that were criticized for being anti-Semitic. In his apology letter, Haughm stated that Pillorian would not continue.

It consists of the V√§h√§-Ahvenkoski (Swedish: Lillabborfors) village in Loviisa and the Ahvenkoski village in Pyht√§√§. The site is especially known of its rich military history. Between 1743 and 1809, Ahvenkoski was a border crossing of Sweden and the Russian Empire. Ahvenkoski was originally part of the Pyht√§√§ municipality. As the border divided the village in two, the Swedish side became known as Ruotsinpyht√§√§, the Swedish Pyht√§√§, which was annexed to the town of Loviisa in 2010. Ahvenkoski is listed as a Cultural environment of national significance by the Finnish National Board of Antiquities. The Ahvenkoski rapid was mostly destroyed in the 1930s, as the water level rose several meters due to the construction of a hydroelectric power station.  History  The 18th-century mail house in a Finnish stamp Ahvenkoski was known as a marketplace since the 13th century. In 2010, the archaeologists found a remnants of a Viking Age harbor. The found objects are similar to the ones found at various Norse activity in the British Isles, and in Norse settlements in different parts of the Northern Europe. The historical King's Road ran by the village, crossing the river through the Kirmusaari Island. The Ahvenkoski Manor was established in 1561. During the Livonian War in the 1570s, the manor and the village were burned down by the Russian troops. The manor was last destroyed in the mid-1800s, the present building was completed 1894. After the 1741‚Äì1743 Russo-Swedish War, the border between Sweden and Russia was moved to Ahvenkoski. Both sides established their mail and custom houses to the village and started building various fortifications by the river. The Finnish War begun in February 1808, as the Russian troops crossed the border in Ahvenkoski. As war ended, Finland became an autonomous part of the Russian Empire. In 1812, the border of Grand Duchy of Finland and Russia was moved 200 kilometres east to the Karelian Isthmus, Ahvenkoski lost its importance and the structures started slowly decaying. The last military conflict in the area was the Finnish Civil War Battle of Ahvenkoski, fought between the German troops and the Finnish Red Guards in April 1918. It was the final battle of the Civil War.  Transport  The Finnish national road 7 runs by Ahvenkoski as a part of the European route E18 highway. The highway was rerouted in the 1960s, and the modern four-lane motorway was opened in 2013‚Äì2014. The 1928 completed Savukoski Bridge, replacing the one destroyed in the 1918 Civil War, is today a tourist attraction, holding a status of a museum bridge.

For most of the battle both sides occupied trenches along the Kymi river. Ahvenkoski and the surrounding Kymi valley region were the last strongholds of the Reds. The battle ended with the surrender of the last of the Red Guards on 5 May, which ended the war with White Finland and Germany defeating Red Finland.  German campaign begins  The German Empire supported White Finland, the precursor of the modern Finnish state, during the civil war against Red Finland and its paramilitary army, the Red Guards. Thus, Germany launched a military campaign in southeast Finland on 7April 1918 with the landing of Detachment Brandenstein () in Loviisa. Their goal was to take the coastal town of Kotka situated east of Loviisa, then move north along the vital Saint Petersburg railway to the railway junction of Kouvola. The next morning, a 300-soldier reconnaissance unit reached the outskirts of Kotka, but was stopped in the Battle of Kyminlinna. As the Germans waited for reinforcements, they tapped enemy telephone lines and mistakenly believed that the Red Guards had a reserve of 10,000‚Äì30,000 soldiers heading to Kotka from the northern Kymi valley region. In reality the Reds were strengthened by only 450 men. The German unit retreated to Ahvenkoski, east of Kotka. As they were soon followed by the Reds, they moved further west, where they dug into defensive positions by the Taasianjoki river. The Reds did not advance past Ahvenkoski, where they occupied 18th- century fortifications by the Kymi river. They were soon reinforced by units who had retreated from the Karelian front.  Battle at Ahvenkoski  The next ten days were quiet, as the fighting was focused north of Loviisa in the Eastern Uusimaa region. On 22April the Germans moved up to Ahvenkoski and attacked the next morning. The battle lasted two days, but they were not able to break through the Red lines. On25 April, the Reds left their positions on the western side of the Kymi river and retreated across it, destroying bridges behind them. The Germans occupied the trenches on the western side of the Kymi river, and the battle paused for the next eight days. The Reds' front in Karelia collapsed after the Battle of Vyborg () on 29April and they suffered a decisive loss at the Battle of Lahti. This meant that the Kymi valley region was now the last Red stronghold. A ceasefire was established on 3 May, and the parties started negotiations for a Red surrender.  Red Finland surrenders  The Reds in Kymenlaakso started surrendering on 4 May, first in the village of Inkeroinen in Anjalankoski. The same evening the Whites entered Kotka, where 4,000 Reds surrendered with hardly any resistance. The last Reds left were now the 800‚Äì900 fighters in Ahvenkoski. The negotiations in Ahvenkoski were mediated by foreign representatives based in Kotka. The Red delegation was led by Juho Kaven, a 24-year-old carpenter from Malmi, Helsinki. The Finnish Whites demanded an unconditional surrender, but according to the agreement concluded with the Germans, the individual soldiers would be released and only the leaders would be made prisoners. The Reds were to surrender their weapons by 6p.m. on 5May at the latest. The surrender became effective at midday of 5 May, as 800 Reds marched behind their commander Oskar Vinter towards the German lines on the western bank of the Kymi river. After crossing the Rajasilta (\\"border bridge\\"), they surrendered their weapons. Despite the agreement, the Red fighters were not released. After capturing the Reds, the Whites separated the staff members, platoon leaders and trade union activists from the crowd, and took them to the Svartholm fortress, where they were immediately shot. The rest were kept overnight in the V√§h√§-Ahvenkoski village, and then transported to various White prison camps in Southern Finland. The following week, the Whites executed nearly 300 Reds in Kymi valley.  Aftermath  According to a list of Germans who were killed in action during the war, at least 13 Germans died during the attack of 22 and 23April. According to a Finnish casualty database, at least 13 Reds died during the battle within the Pyht√§√§ municipality. Seven Germans were buried in Ahvenkoski Cemetery, as well as an unknown number of Reds. A memorial on the Red mass grave was erected in 1946. In September 2013, a memorial to the end of the Civil War was unveiled at the site where the last Reds surrendered. The Battle of Ahvenkoski was the last action of the Civil War, but the White Army Commander-in-Chief C. G. E. Mannerheim did not declare the war over until 16May, when the Russians had left Fort Ino near Petrograd.

The contract was awarded to in 2012 with delivery scheduled for 2015‚Äì2018. After delays in production, a prototype car failed buff strength test in August 2015, leading to the cancellation of the contract with Nippon Sharyo. Siemens replaced Nippon Sharyo as the construction subcontractor in late 2017 and under the new contract, the Siemens Venture be delivered in 2020‚Äì2023 instead of the bilevel design. The cars were designed by the Next Generation Corridor Equipment Pool Committee (NGCE) under the provisions of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008. The cars were intended to replace single-level Amfleet and Horizon cars in the Midwest and supplement the bilevel Surfliner railcar and California Car railcars in California. History The Next Generation Bi-Level Passenger Rail Car was to be the third generation of a design that began with the California Car, which entered service in 1996. The California Car was itself a derivative of Amtrak's successful Superliner long- distance coach, which entered service in 1979. An improved version of the California Car, the Surfliner, entered service in 2000. Caltrans and Amtrak began drafting the specification for a third generation of the design in 2006. This specification, dubbed \\"Corridor Car for the 21st Century\\" or C21, became the basis for the design work undertaken by the Next Generation Corridor Equipment Pool Committee (NGCE) under the provisions of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 beginning in 2009. The specification encompassed three car types: a standard coach, a combination cab-baggage car, and a cafe-lounge car. All three types would measure high, long, and wide. The cars were designed for low-level boarding only; the distance from the rail to the bottom step is . The coach would seat a maximum of 89 passengers, most of them on the upper level. Seating would be 2√ó2, with some table seating provided. Stairs at both ends of the car provided access between levels. There would be restrooms on both levels, and a bicycle rack on the lower level. The cab-baggage design would have capacity for 15 fewer passengers, with much of the lower level seating given over to checked baggage storage. The cafe-lounge would have a single staircase at one end, with the galley located centrally on the upper level. The car would have some passenger seating, but most space would be used for lounge seating. Caltrans, on behalf of the state coalition (California, Michigan, Missouri and Illinois), issued a request for proposal (RFP) for building cars to the new bilevel specification in April 2012. Five companies submitted final proposals: Alstom, Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles (CAF), Kawasaki, Siemens, and Sumitomo. Caltrans awarded the contract to Sumitomo in November 2012. Sumitomo, in turn, selected Nippon Sharyo as the carbuilder for the order. The contract was for 130 cars, valued at $352 million. Eighty-eight of the cars were for the Midwestern states and 42 for California. Delivery of the new cars was scheduled for 2015‚Äì2018. The 88 Midwestern cars were funded by a $220 million American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) grant which, by law, had to be spent by September 30, 2017. This ambitious schedule proved untenable. By May 2015, Caltrans acknowledged that the project was fourteen months behind schedule and replaced much of its project management team. The project slipped further that August when the new car shell failed a buff strength compression test. This failure forced a complete redesign of the car, delaying the project by at least two years. This would place delivery beyond the expiration of the ARRA funds. In November 2017, Caltrans and Sumitomo announced that Siemens would replace Nippon Sharyo as a subcontractor. Under a new contract, valued at $371 million, Siemens would deliver 137 Siemens Venture single-level cars instead of bilevel cars. The cars will be delivered from mid-2020 to 2023.

History While the use of timber frames for the construction of 1-2 story buildings is typical in many countries (see: timber framing), antiquated building codes in the United States discouraged wood frame construction in 5-floor buildings or higher for many years.Garrett Andrews, Wood: the sky‚Äôs the limit, Daily Journal of Commerce, 8 March 2017 With the advancement of science, construction technologies and innovation have led to the use of engineered wood products that have load capacities stronger than steel, and fire resilience beyond those required to meet US building code standards. These improved qualities, alongside the historical construction of tall wood buildings in Europe., have led to an acceptance of wood in US construction and new building codes are being proposed to adjust for this The Carbon12 building ran in the USDA's Tall Wood Buildings contest (2014) but did not win the prize. Oregon Governor Kate Brown was present when the building reached its peak height. The Carbon12 is acclaimed as a booster for Oregon's timber industry. Given the rising popularity of wood construction, Carbon12's title of tallest wood building in the United States is already being challenged by a 148-feet, 11-floor wood-framing building in Portland, Framework, under construction. Description The building measures 85 feet high for 8 floors, 2 units per floor. The building employs mass timber, glued laminated timber (glulam) and CLT (cross-laminated timber) in its structural system. Steel is used in the core and for connecting braces, and concrete for the basement, ground floor and garage (automated garage), with two ground floor retail spaces. Residents of the Carbon12 have given interviews describing the building as \\"beautiful\\" and \\"bright\\". Some residents have also applauded the buildings commitment to universal design, which accommodates individuals who are not typically considered in the use of a building and might otherwise find themselves unable to access areas of a structure or their home.

The full-length directorial debut of Kathleen Hepburn, the film is a family drama which stars Shirley Henderson as Judy, a woman struggling with the advancing symptoms of Parkinson's disease while her son Jamie (Th√©odore Pellerin) is struggling to come to terms with his identity. The film is an expansion of Hepburn's earlier short film of the same title, which starred Tina Hedman as Judy and Dylan Playfair as Jamie and is partially based on Hepburn's own experiences with her mother's Parkinson's. Plot Judy and her husband Ed live with their 18-year-old son Jamie in a remote, isolated community at the edge of Stuart Lake, British Columbia. Judy has suffered from Parkinson's Disease for 19 of the 23 years she and Ed have been married, with Ed acting as her supportive caregiver, helping her to complete basic tasks such as getting dressed and taking her medication. Despite her illness, Judy attempts to lead a normal life by attending a Parkinson's support group each week to help manage her disease. Jamie spends most of his time hanging out with his best friend Danny, smoking and playing hockey. When Danny moves away for college, Jamie finds himself at loose ends, struggling to fully deal with the enormity of his mother's illness, and feeling left behind as Danny's phone calls become more sporadic. Ed convinces Jamie to get a job in the Alberta oil fields. Jamie finds it somewhat difficult to fit in with his overly macho co-workers and the testosterone- fuelled environment they create by frequently discussing topics that make him uncomfortable, such as sex and violence, and by relentlessly bullying him. He struggles with his sexuality and briefly fantasizes about kissing Danny. After returning from her support group one day, Judy finds Ed face down in the water, having suffered a fatal heart attack. Jamie returns for the funeral and offers to move back home in order to look after Judy but she refuses, telling him he has to go and live his life. When she asks if he enjoys his job, he lies. Without Ed, Judy begins to find daily life more and more challenging but fiercely battles to remain independent. She often wakes up early in the morning and goes to sit on a boat in the lake where Ed drowned as a way to try and maintain their connection. While shopping in town, the cashier, a pregnant 17-year-old girl named Kaly, tells Judy that the store operates a home delivery service should she require it. Judy is pulled over when driving home because she is driving erratically and the police officer suspects that she is drunk. After explaining that she just needs to take her pills, he advises her that it is probably best she not drive unless she has taken her medications. As winter intensifies, tasks such as chopping firewood become even more difficult, so Judy begins having her groceries delivered. Kaly befriends Judy, who in turn provides her with advice about her impending motherhood. The death of his father causes Jamie to spiral and he uses cocaine after finding some that his supervisor Daryl has dropped. When Daryl chastises him for working too slowly, Jamie lashes out and the two men get into a fight, but Daryl is blamed and their boss tells Jamie that he is free to continue working as long as he passes a drug test. Jamie refuses to take the test and walks off the job. He pays a female prostitute to give him oral sex but he does not enjoy it, and he destroys his car windshield in a fit of rage when it won't start. He returns home where he meets Kaly during one of her deliveries. Judy asks Jamie to pick up her pills and, while in town, he visits Kaly at work and asks her about her baby's father. She explains that he has taken an out-of-town job and she thinks he is scared. Although initially resistant, Jamie persuades her to meet him after her shift. They discuss his mother, and he says that he finds it difficult to see her slowly deteriorate knowing that there is no chance she will get better. He then asks Kaly if she has ever been with another girl before admitting that he is confused and has thought about being with Danny. She kisses him and the two have a sexual encounter in his car. Afterwards, Kaly asks if he enjoyed it and he tells her that he did. Jamie drives home and finds all of the lights turned off. Judy calls to him from the bathroom and he finds her lying in freezing cold water, unable to get out because she hasn't taken her pills. He carries her to her bed and helps her get dressed before breaking down in tears. He apologizes for not bringing her medication sooner but she tells him not to worry. She then apologizes to him, saying that she should be the one supporting him as opposed to the other way around. They embrace and promise to be there for one another. The next morning, Judy wakes up early and makes her way to the now-frozen lake where she sits down and talks to Ed, wishing him a Merry Christmas.

On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 70 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating \\"generally favourable reviews\\". Shirley Henderson received critical acclaim for her role as Judy, with The Irish Times calling it a \\"career-best performance\\" and an \\"extraordinary, detailed turn\\". Similarly, Screen Daily stated that \\"not only does [Henderson] convincingly embody the relentless motion of Judy's disease, but also encapsulates the dignified resilience of a life lived with the affliction\\" before going on to say that her performance is a \\"tour de force which is, at times, devastating to watch\\". Henderson was referred to as the \\"highlight\\" of the film by reviewers at the Glasgow Film Festival, explaining that \\"she never comes across as a victim of her disease, but rather as a strong individual who manages to cope in spite of her disability\\".
