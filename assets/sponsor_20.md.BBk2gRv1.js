At a young age he showed considerable talent as a pianist, attending the Juilliard School along with pianist Van Cliburn as a student of Rosina Lh√©vinne.Rolfe, L. (2004). The Uncommon Friendship of Yaltah Menuhin and Willa Cather. California Classic Books; While later studying in London with famed pianist Dame Myra Hess in 1959, Joel Rice was introduced to Yaltah Menuhin, sister of violinist Yehudi Menuhin, who had come to play in the Bath Festival. A year later, after their marriage in America on Joel's 27th birthday in 1960, the young pianists were invited to play together at a festival in California. They so enjoyed this first performance, that they subsequently devoted a large portion of their time each season to joint appearances, playing solos, duets and works for two pianos and television appearances in New York, Paris and Geneva. In 1962, the duo won the Harriet Cohen International Music Award for their London debut, in a program largely devoted to works by Schubert for four hands. In 1966, they performed the Mozart Double Piano Concerto under the baton of Yehudi Menuhin in Gstaad, Switzerland and other venues in Europe. In 1967, Yaltah and Joel recorded the entire duet repertoire of Mozart in America for Everest Records, the first time ever that this was done by one team of artists. During their annual tours in America and Europe, they gave many charity performances, for such organizations as the Swiss Technical Overseas Relief, for mental hospitals, needy infants in Germany, the World Day of Peace at the Lausanne Swiss National Exposition, and for the opening of United Nations Week in London. Jungian psychology The Self in Early Childhood by Joel Ryce-Menuhin, 1988. Physical illness forced Joel to end his musical career in 1971. During the following years, strongly supported by Yaltah, he studied psychology in Switzerland with the founder of Sandplay therapy, Dora M. Kalff, and he became a highly regarded Jungian psychotherapist. He wrote several music-related books with his wife, Yaltah Menuhin, and wrote and edited several books on psychology (Jung and the Monotheisms, Jungian Sandplay: The Wonderful Therapy, et al.). He formerly edited the Jungian journal, Harvest. Personal life Joel Ryce-Menuhin and his wife were married for almost forty years. Following an extended struggle with cancer, Ryce-Menuhin died on March 31, 1998, aged 64, with his wife by his side. Yaltah Menuhin continued to live in their home in Canfield Gardens, Hampstead, England, where she died on June 9, 2001.

Born in the far north in a family of hunters, he became the first Nenets artist. He started to paint his landscapes, although he had never seen any paintings. As Gennady Gor wrote, \\"Pankov's paintings are meditations on his land in terms of color. In the Far North airplanes and self-propelled sledges can be seen side by side with sleds pulled by teams of reindeer. Even in our day, books and TV screens co-exist there with the folklore of times past. Pankov's life reads like a fairy-tale. As a youth he used to ski through his native taiga with a song on his lips. Then the song assumed the shape of paintings and, thus metamorphosed, reached Leningrad and Moscow, and Paris\\". Konstantin was born in 1910 in the village Saranpaul which is now in Beryozovsky District, Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, in the Northern Urals. His father was a Nenets, his mother a Mansi. He entered the Institute for Peoples of the North in Leningrad. The art studio of the institute was supervised by A. Uspensky and L. Mess. They fully realized how intricate and unusual had been the road traveled by their talented disciple, a primitive hunter only two years before. Pankov and his studio mates had no idea of the long-standing traditions of Western and Russian art before they came to Leningrad, for they had simply never seen a picture. Perhaps Pankov ought to have been first taken to the Hermitage or the Russian Museum and shown the great masterpieces of Rembrandt and Rubens or Briullov and Alexander Ivanov. Uspensky and Mess did not want to rush things, because Pankov had never seen a picture in his life, except the portraits at the Institute, and might have taken the first masterpiece he saw for an inviolable standard to follow and surrendered his will to somebody else's way of vision. The traditions of \\"anonymous\\" art, folklore, so different from those of the present-day visual arts, are obvious in Pankov's works. Pankov is unique, for he fuses the folkloristic vision of life and ingenuousness of taiga-born hunter with the modern technique of painting and faultless sense of colour and composition. The high aesthetic merit of the young artist's pictures, their singular and novel character, could not, of course, remain unnoticed. Pictures by Pankov and his studio mates were repeatedly reproduced in many magazines in the thirties. They decorated the Pavilion of the Far North at the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition and the Soviet Pavilion at the Paris Exposition of 1937. Thousands and thousands of Parisians visiting the Soviet Pavilion were deeply impressed by the art of the minor nationalities of the Soviet Far North, to whom the October Revolution had given a new lease of life. The Jury of the Exposition rated the works of the painters of the Far North, notably Pankov, who were awarded the Grand Prix and Gold Medals. The Honorary Diploma of the Exposition conferred upon the Institute for Peoples of the North is kept at the Leningrad Museum of the Arctic. As soon as World War II began, Konstantin Pankov joined the Red Army as a sniper and scout, making good use of his knowledge of the North. He was fighting on the Volkhov Front in 1942 when he was killed in action. References * Konstantin Pankov.

It was first syndicated in 1999. It is currently syndicated by Creators Syndicate. Overview Agnes chronicles the adventures of an elementary school-aged girl living in an Ohio trailer park called \\"The People's Court\\" with her kind yet weary grandmother (whom Agnes refers to as ‚ÄúGranma‚Äù). It has not been revealed what happened to Agnes' parents or how she came to be in her grandmother's custody. Agnes is poor and not what one would consider a classical beauty, yet is a dreamer and schemer, whose limitless imagination and ambitions are constantly brought down to Earth by her limited resources and social standing. Agnes is constantly confronted with the harsh realities of the life of the poor working class but still manages to find the optimism to carry on, frequently with a bit of sarcasm and wit using surprisingly sophisticated vocabulary. A typical strip will show Agnes finding new schemes in hopes of getting rich or attaining celebrity, or just using her imagination to get through everyday terrors and frustrations. Although quite intelligent, Agnes does not do well in school; she frequently exasperates her teachers and finds herself in the principal's office. Her social interactions are generally limited to Granma and neighbor/schoolmate/confidant Trout, both of whom constantly pop the balloon of Agnes' dreams with hard facts and wisdom. Main characters =Agnes= Within a body consisting of skinny legs, a large nose and huge spectacles covering the majority of her face lays the creative mind and indomitable spirit of the strip‚Äôs protagonist, Agnes. Born into poverty and seemingly abandoned by her biological parents she has lived a nomadic life with her grandmother in a rather old and decidedly sparse trailer. Having settled down on the fringe of an un-specified town she is also on the fringe of life. Agnes does not accept or believe that she will always remain unattractive, poor and a social outcast; quite the contrary, she can imagine a multitude of scenarios that will allow her to escape her humdrum existence. The heir apparent to a long history of American hucksters, Agnes can seemingly find potential profit and fame from items one would usually consign to the garbage dump. She is always going from one ‚Äúget rich quick‚Äù scheme to another, be it a medical breakthrough (one of her inventions was a balm for bugs) or a new untried, unheard-of fashion accessory. She also attempts to create new characters and mascots for various holidays, most famously ‚ÄúKaloopa Queen of the Snow Leopards,‚Äù who she hopes will become a new symbol of Christmas. Acutely aware of her personal aesthetic limitations, she frequently hopes that Granma will buy her various high-fashion garments or shoes, though is usually limited to whatever Granma can find that is practical and on sale. Agnes‚Äô lack of marks of classical beauty are emphasized by her inanimate yet frequent companion, a Barbie-like doll named ‚ÄúMiss Glitter‚Äù. =Granma= Granma Practical and pragmatic, Agnes' grandmother most likely did not imagine her golden years being spent living in a trailer, working a dead-end factory job and raising her precocious granddaughter. Granma‚Äôs no-nonsense way of dealing with life‚Äôs everyday disasters is described by Agnes as ‚Äúmixing tragedy and farce.‚Äù Barely eking along from small-paycheck-to-small-paycheck, she still manages to keep Agnes reasonably fed and clothed, though certainly not to her granddaughter's fantastical standards. Poor but proud, Granma may live in an old trailer but insists on it being kept neat and tidy, much to Agnes‚Äô (who especially despises folding towels and having to make her bed) chagrin. =Trout= Agnes‚Äô best friend and trailer court neighbor, the tomboyish Trout is a foil to Agnes‚Äô dreaming. Trout seems to be happy with what life has handed her, but frequently will go along with Agnes‚Äô latest scheme ‚Äî generally because there really isn‚Äôt that much else to do in their world. Easily satisfied with what she has yet quick to point out hard logic and facts to Agnes, Trout is a loyal friend.

History The council follows a tradition of presidential advisory panels focused on science and technology that dates back to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Science Advisory Board, continued by President Harry Truman. Renamed the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) by Dwight Eisenhower, it was disbanded by President Richard Nixon. Reagan science advisor Jay Keyworth re-established a smaller \\"White House Science Council\\" It reported, however, to him, not directly to the President.Robert C. Cowan, \\"Reagan Adviser Keyworth on Administration's Science Policy\\", Christian Science Monitor, January 22, 1985. Renamed PCAST, and reporting directly to the President, a new council was chartered by President George H. W. Bush in 1990, enabling the President to receive advice directly from the private and academic sectors on technology, scientific research priorities, and mathematics and science education.Elizabeth Pennisi, \\"Low-Key Start For Bush's Science Panel\\", The Scientist, March 5, 1990. Mission The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology mission is to provide advice to the President and the Executive Office of the President. PCAST makes policy recommendations in areas such as understanding of science, technology, and innovation. PCAST is administered by the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). Recent PCAST reports have addressed antibiotic resistance, education technology (with a focus on MOOCs), cybersecurity, climate change, networking and information technology, and agricultural preparedness, among many others.  Members and structure  PCAST has been enlarged since its inception and currently consists of 18 members plus the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, who serves as the Council's Co-Chair.

In Sabathu the 4th Gorkha Rifles Centre was merged with the 1st Gorkha Rifles Centre to become the First and Fourth Gorkha Training Centre (14 GTC). In the wake of the move of the 4 GRRC from Bakloh to Sabathu, Indian Army Headquarters, in Delhi, on the prompting of senior officers of regiment, was \\"ready to consider\\" locating one battalion of the regiment in Bakloh to look after regimental pensioners, property, and widows. The idea, of reserving Bakloh for a battalion of the Regiment, however, did not find favour with many officers, including Commanding officers and \\"nothing came of it.\\" The main objections raised against Bakloh being designated as reserved location for the Regiment was lack of educational facilities, and sources of \\"entertainment of big cities\\". Following the move of the 4 GR Regimental Centre to Sabathu, Bakloh ceased to be exclusively a 4th Gorkha Rifles station. The Barracks, and Bungalows of 1/4 GR, and 2/4 GR, eponymously referred to as 1/4 and 2/4 lines, became peacetime locations for two battalion-sized units through which infantry units are rotated every two-three years. =Battalions in Bakloh= 3/4 GR In 1948, 3/4 Gorkha Rifles (3/4 GR), which was in Jammu, was moved to Bakloh to occupy the spare accommodation in Bakloh, as the centre started to move out. While the Third Battalion (3/4GR) was in Bakloh, Maj General Walter David Alexander Lentaigne, CB, CBE, DSO, better known as \\"Joe\\" Lentaigne, who was then the Commandant of the Indian Defense Services Staff College, Wellington, Niligri hills, Tamil Nadu, and the Colonel of Regiment, 4 Gorkha Rifles, visited Bakloh on his farewell rounds and to be with the Third Battalion, which had served under him during the Burma campaign, as part of the Chindit Operations, in World War II . During the visit, he made a big impression on the young Indian Officers. While reviewing the Guard of Honor he spoke with the men in fluent Nepali, reminisced about the war in Burma, and recognized those who had served with him in the war by their names and, more impressively, by their regimental numbers. 5/4 GR The Fifth Battalion (5/4 GR) was raised in the 1/4 GR lines, Bakloh, in 1963, by Lt Colonel Ranjit Singh Chandel. The battalion, after three years in NEFA, returned to Bakloh for a second tenure in 1974. On 5 June 1976, Lt Colonel V Rajaram, formerly of 3/4 GR, succeeded Lt Colonel Jayant Pawar, as the commanding Officer. During its second tenure in Bakloh, the regimental reunion was held, in 1977. After the reunion, the battalion moved to Jammu and Kashmir in 1977. The reunion was attended by a large number of officers, junior commissioned officers and men, including many Indian and British officers who had served in Bakloh before the 4 GR Centre was shifted to Sabathu. =4 Gorkha Rifle properties= The 4 GR owns several historical regimental properties in Bakloh. These include the 4 GR Memorial on the edge of the old 1/4 GR parade ground, Kharati lines, 1/4 GR and 2/4 GR widow's lines, mandirs, and the 19th century Sealy Bungalow, which briefly housed the regimental kindergarten, but is now in a state of neglect and disrepair. Senior officers of the regiment have suggested that it be converted into a holiday home. The resident battalion of the regiment is expected to take care of the regiment‚Äôs properties in Bakloh. In the absence of a battalion of the regiment, the Gorkha Sabha is expected to take care of these properties for which it receives a small supplement from the regiment. To ensure better care of these and other regimental 'remains' in Bakloh, it has been suggested that these be handed over to the Gorkha Sabha, Bakloh, for better upkeep. =Regimental memorial, Bakloh= A regimental memorial \\"To commemorate the relationship with Bakloh and 4 GR, ie the Home of the 4 Gorkhas\\" was constructed at the entrance of the parade ground, in 2003. The Cantonment Board, Bakloh, was given the responsibility for its upkeep and maintenance, by the General Officer Commanding, Mountain Division. Since then doubts have arisen on the commitment of the Cantonment Board to maintain the memorial, and it has been suggested that the Gorkha Sabha should be enlisted to ensure its care and security. = Regimental mandirs = Over the years 4 Gorkha Rifles has constructed several temples in Bakloh. The first temple, the 1/4 GR Mandir, was made by the 1/4 GR in the 19th century. In it are three deities- Shiva, Kali-ka, and Gorakh Nath. This Mandir is maintained by 1/4 GR and 5/4 GR. It was renovated in 2012. The first Pujari of 1/4 GR temple was Pandit Neel Kanth. In 1890, 2/4 GR constructed the Kali-ka mandir or 2/4 GR mandir. This temple is currently being maintained by the Gorkha Sabha, Bakloh. In 1923, the Gorkh Nath mandir was constructed.

The temple was inspired and designed by Agam Gurung. It was constructed in 1946 with local material, in the Nepal temple style, with three tier roof, by demolished men waiting to released after World War II. It is located on the path to Dalhousie, below the First Four Bazaar. The temple contain memorial plaques with names of those killed in World War II. Until the construction of the new regimental mandir in 2008, this was considered the main and the most sacred Regimental Mandir, in Bakloh, used for Sansari Pooja. The regiment's centenary pooja in 1957 was conducted in this mandir. It was maintained by annual contributions by battalions of the regiment. However, over the years, its upkeep was neglected. It lost patrons because of, amongst other reasons, its relative remoteness. 2/4 GR after it returned from the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), in 2000, carried out repairs and renovation of Shri Guru Gorakhnath Mandir. The repair and renovation was led by Subedar Major Dhan Bahadur Rana, and executed by Pioneer/Assault Platoon Commander Subedar Indra Bahadur Gurung. The renovated mandir was inaugurated by Lt Gen Ashok Chakki, Colonel Commandant, 4GR, in July 2001. 4GR Gorakh Nath Regimental Mandir Despite the many regimental mandirs in Bakloh, in May 2007, it was decided by the Colonel of the Regiment and the Centre Commandant, to construct yet another mandir. The new mandir, designated as 4GR Gorakh Nath Regimental Mandir, was constructed in four months from December 2007 to April 2008, under the supervision of Mr Swaminathan, from Tamil Nadu, and Naib Subedar Sher Bahadur Thapa, who was awarded a 'Commendation Card' by the Army Commander for his work in constructing the new mandir. The new mandir is located above and on the right of the Kalimata mandir. The new regimental mandir was formally inaugurated on 22 April 2008, with much fan-fare, by Lt Gen TK Sapru, GOC in C Western Command, in the presence of all the Commanding Officers, Subedar-Majors, and religious teachers of the Regiment.  Annual Shobha Yatra  Every year in April a Shobha yatra, in which large number of ex-servicemen participate, starts from the Guru Gorakh Nath Mandir. The yatra goes around Bakloh, covering a distance of approximately 10 kilometers. From 19 to 22 April each year Puja, is conducted at the Guru Gorakh Nath Mandir,the Sansari Mandir, and the Kali Mata Mandir. On the last day of the puja program a combined Regimental puja is held in Guru Gorakh Nath Mandir. The format for the Pooja celebrations is issued by the Commandant 14 GTC as a Standing Operating Procedure. In addition to ex-servicemen, small puja contingents from each of the five battalions and the 14 GTC also participate in the event. These celebrations are followed by a barakhana for ex-servicemen and their families. Cantonment Board Bakloh Cantonment was established in 1866. It is category IV Cantonment. The board consists of four members, including two elected members. Gorkha Sabha, Bakloh The Gorkha Sabha was established in 1933.

The News from Bakloh usually carries a brief account of the work of the Gorkha Sabha, the activities of its members, and its concerns. In the News from Bakloh, for 2012, the President of the Sabha, noted that ‚Äò Bakloh has been forgotten‚Äô by the regiment, and that \\"Bakloh is developing well day by day\\". The Gorkha Sabha leadership has often been faulted for lack of leadership, particularly in motivating pensioners to participate in self-help community projects; mobilizing funds for its activities; and tardiness in the upkeep and securing of regimental properties. A former Commanding Officer of 2/4 Gorkha Rifles, in 2011, wrote, that his attempts in the 1980s to \\"improve the ‚Äòconditions of ex servicemen'\\" did not make headway and that pensioners were \\"reluctant to tread fresh ground and were unwilling to undertake any projects.\\" Another senior officer of the Regiment, in 2011, observed that the Gorkha Sabha is a divided house with \\"various stake holders (from different regiments pulling in different directions)\\", and that the \\"present avatar of Gorkha Sabha is mostly on a 'begging bowl mode'.\\" =Aims and objectives= The Gorkha Sabha receives financial assistance from the Government of India for welfare activities which includes providing Stipends and scholarship to deserving dependents of ex servicemen; and conducting coaching classes and vocational training, in various fields. In addition, it interfaces with respective record offices to resolve pension problems, secure financial assistance from the AIGEWA, and the Zila Sainik board in Chamba, and arrange to issue of canteen and ECHS smart cards.

In 1877 the 4 Gurkhas Regimental School, had 56 students. The Inspector of Education, in that year, in his annual report, noted that the progress was ‚Äònot very satisfactory‚Äô, and that improvement was expected after the return of the Master who had been sent to Umballa, for ‚Äòa course of instruction in the Military Normal School. Even after the 4th GR Centre moved from Bakloh to Sabathu, battalions of the regiment, whenever located in Bakloh, as a matter of course, have run primary school for the children of soldiers, and dependents of pensioners.

History Balapur was an important military station after Ellichpur now Achalpur during the Mughal period.Imperial Gazetteer2 of India, Volume 6, page 234 - Imperial Gazetteer of India - Digital South Asia Library It became the seat of Provincial governor of Berar instead of EllichpurImperial Gazetteer2 of India, Volume 12, page 20 - Imperial Gazetteer of India - Digital South Asia Library and Prince Murad, son of Akbar settled in Barar with Balapur as his headquarters in 1596. Near Balapur he founded a new city named Shahpur and constructed a beautiful palace for himself which is now in ruins. As his relationship was deteriorating with Abdur Raheem Khan-i-Khanan, the commander of the army, Akbar recalled the Khan-i-Khanan and sent his trusted friend Abul Fazl to help him. After the fall of Ahmadnagar, Balapur was still the principal garrison town of Berar, but the next prince sent to administer the Deccan after the death of Murad, Daniyal Mirza preferred Burhanpur, as his viceregal capital. Daniyal died of drink in 1605. The death of his third son was a severe shock to the Emperor Akbar, who survived Daniyal Mirza only for a few months, and died in October 1605, when he was succeeded by his eldest son Salim (Jehangir). The climate of Balapur had an unfortunate effect on the Mughal officers. Akbar's son Murad had already died there from the effects of drink, and in 1617 Raja Maan Singh, a distinguished and valued officer of Jahangir's, died there from the same cause. Shahnawaz Khan succumbed to the same fate a few years later. Balapur was one of the richest Pargana in Berar Subah. Muhammad Azam Shah, Son of Aurangzeb resided and build a Mud fort here. A Chhatri or Pavilion was erected by Mirza Raja Jai Singh, Commander of Shah Jahan and general of Aurangzeb. In 1720 Asaf Jah defeated the Mughal forces dispatched against him. Education 1\\\\.

The √©tale topology was originally introduced by Grothendieck to define √©tale cohomology, and this is still the √©tale topology's most well- known use. Definitions For any scheme X, let √ât(X) be the category of all √©tale morphisms from a scheme to X. This is the analog of the category of open subsets of X (that is, the category whose objects are varieties and whose morphisms are open immersions). Its objects can be informally thought of as √©tale open subsets of X. The intersection of two objects corresponds to their fiber product over X. √ât(X) is a large category, meaning that its objects do not form a set. An √©tale presheaf on X is a contravariant functor from √ât(X) to the category of sets. A presheaf F is called an √©tale sheaf if it satisfies the analog of the usual gluing condition for sheaves on topological spaces. That is, F is an √©tale sheaf if and only if the following condition is true. Suppose that is an object of √ât(X) and that is a jointly surjective family of √©tale morphisms over X. For each i, choose a section xi of F over Ui. The projection map , which is loosely speaking the inclusion of the intersection of Ui and Uj in Ui, induces a restriction map . If for all i and j the restrictions of xi and xj to are equal, then there must exist a unique section x of F over U which restricts to xi for all i. Suppose that X is a Noetherian scheme. An abelian √©tale sheaf F on X is called finite locally constant if it is a representable functor which can be represented by an √©tale cover of X. It is called constructible if X can be covered by a finite family of subschemes on each of which the restriction of F is finite locally constant. It is called torsion if F(U) is a torsion group for all √©tale covers U of X. Finite locally constant sheaves are constructible, and constructible sheaves are torsion. Every torsion sheaf is a filtered inductive limit of constructible sheaves. Grothendieck originally introduced the machinery of Grothendieck topologies and topoi to define the √©tale topology. In this language, the definition of the √©tale topology is succinct but abstract: It is the topology generated by the pretopology whose covering families are jointly surjective families of √©tale morphisms. The small √©tale site of X is the category O(X√©t) whose objects are schemes U with a fixed √©tale morphism U ‚Üí X. The morphisms are morphisms of schemes compatible with the fixed maps to X. The big √©tale site of X is the category √ât/X, that is, the category of schemes with a fixed map to X, considered with the √©tale topology. The √©tale topology can be defined using slightly less data. First, notice that the √©tale topology is finer than the Zariski topology. Consequently, to define an √©tale cover of a scheme X, it suffices to first cover X by open affine subschemes, that is, to take a Zariski cover, and then to define an √©tale cover of an affine scheme. An √©tale cover of an affine scheme X can be defined as a surjective family {uŒ± : XŒ± ‚Üí X} such that the set of all Œ± is finite, each XŒ± is affine, and each uŒ± is √©tale. Then an √©tale cover of X is a family {uŒ± : XŒ± ‚Üí X} which becomes an √©tale cover after base changing to any open affine subscheme of X.  Local rings in the √©tale topology  Let X be a scheme with its √©tale topology, and fix a point x of X. In the Zariski topology, the stalk of X at x is computed by taking a direct limit of the sections of the structure sheaf over all the Zariski open neighborhoods of x. In the √©tale topology, there are strictly more open neighborhoods of x, so the correct analog of the local ring at x is formed by taking the limit over a strictly larger family. The correct analog of the local ring at x for the √©tale topology turns out to be the strict henselization of the local ring \\\\mathcal{O}_{X,x}. It is usually denoted \\\\mathcal{O}_{X,x}^\\\\text{sh}.  Examples  *For each √©tale morphism U \\\\to X, let \\\\mathbb{G}_m(U) = \\\\mathcal{O}_U(U)^{\\\\times}. Then U \\\\mapsto \\\\mathbb{G}_m(U) is a presheaf on X; it is a sheaf since it can be represented by the scheme \\\\operatorname{Spec}_X (\\\\mathcal{O}_X[t, t^{-1}]).

In 1963, Heinz acquired StarKist, and by 1969, the first Morris TV commercials aired. Heinz sold StarKist and 9Lives to Del Monte in 2002. Del Monte spun off the pet foods division as Big Heart in 2014. For a period of time in the late 1970s and early 1980s, 9Lives used Sylvester the Cat from Warner Bros. Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons on the packages and in advertising as the mascot for its newly introduced dry cat food. The animated cartoon TV commercials usually consisted of Sylvester trying to get to his box of 9Lives, while avoiding Hector the Bulldog. Sylvester would always succeed in luring the dog away so he could get his food, but he would find himself a target again by the end of the commercial, when Sylvester would always proclaim 9Lives dry food as \\"worth riskin' your life for!\\" Sylvester never appeared in commercials for 9Lives canned cat food and by 1986 he would be replaced by Morris for the dry food packaging and advertising.

The film involves a group of college students on a houseboat for spring break who stumble across a nest of eggs, and unknowingly enrage a large female Nile crocodile that stalks and kills them one by one. It was followed by Crocodile 2: Death Swamp, a film with no relation to the plot of the original beyond featuring a giant crocodile. Plot Eight teenagers, including Brady (Mark McLachlan), Claire (Caitlin Martin), Duncan (Chris Solari), Kit (D. W. Reiser), Annabelle (Julie Mintz), Sunny (Summer Knight), Foster (Rhett Jordan), and Hubs (Greg Wayne) are going on a weekend boat trip on a remote lake in Southern California for spring break. As the group is about to depart on their boat, they are warned by Sheriff Bowman (Harrison Young) to be sensible and keep out of danger. After a day of partying, the group have a bonfire, where Kit tells them a local story about how in the early 1900s, ninety-six years ago, a hotel owner named Harlan featured a crocodile named Flat Dog at his hotel. Harlan eventually sets up a shrine to Flat Dog, believing her to be an avatar to the ancient Egyptian crocodile god (Sobek), creating a cult that worshiped the crocodile. The town eventually ran Harlan away because of his heathenism and torched his hotel years later when Kit was a kid. Close by, two local fishermen destroy a crocodile nest, only for them both to be attacked by Flat Dog, who devours them both. The following day the teenagers continue to party. Annabelle's dog, Princess, runs away, leading the group to the crocodile's nest, where Duncan breaks an egg and Hubs hides one in Claire's bag. At night, Sunny becomes incredibly drunk and reveals Brady cheated on Claire with her, resulting in Claire breaking up with Brady. Hubs, who is also heavily intoxicated falls asleep at the bonfire while the rest of the group returns to the boat. Sometime later, Hubs attempts to return to the boat but is eaten by Flat Dog, while the boat becomes untied and begins to drift in the lake. In the morning, the friends find their boat has become stuck, leaving them stranded. While the rest of the group attempt to fix the boat, Brady and Sunny go to try to find Hubs. Sunny attempts to get Brady to go swimming, but she narrowly escapes an attack by Flat Dog. The pair rush back to the boat to warn the others. However, Flat Dog arrives and sinks the boat, killing Foster in the process. Meanwhile, Sheriff Bowman finds the fishermen and Hubs remains before visiting Shurkin (Terrence Evans) and Lester (Adam Gierasch), two locals who take care of alligators. Shurkin sets out with the Sheriff to find Flat Dog‚Äîand kill her to avenge the deaths of his grandfather and father‚Äîwhile Lester is seen to be feeding the crocodile, but is eventually devoured himself. As night falls, the teenagers are still stranded in the woods searching for a road. Flat Dog returns, and ultimately Sunny is eaten. The rest of the group reach a small shop, where Brady attempts to phone the Sheriff, but Flat Dog breaks through a wall and devours Annabelle. As Kit escapes to start the truck outside, Brady, Claire, and Duncan fight off Flat Dog. In the chaos, a fire starts which causes the truck to explode, killing Kit and scaring away Flat Dog. The next day, the Sheriff and Shurkin find Brady, Claire, and Duncan and pick them up on their boat. Soon after, Shurkin is knocked into the water and eaten, before the Sheriff is also killed. With the boat's engine broken, the survivors swim to land. Claire finally discovers the crocodile's egg in her bag, and the group uses it as bait to lure the crocodile to them so they can kill it. As Flat Dog arrives, Duncan attempts to kill her. However, he is quickly swallowed whole, only to be regurgitated moments later. Claire gives the crocodile the egg, which hatches into a baby crocodile, before it returns to its nest, leaving Claire, Princess, Brady, and Duncan free to escape. Cast Production Producer Frank DeMartini proclaimed that director Tobe Hooper was \\"trying to do with this movie is recapture the fright of [The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]\\". Hooper reflected on this stating \\"It's the 25th anniversary of the first Chain Saw, and I really wanted to create an atmosphere that will wind you up like that.\\" Hooper also comparatively said the film was \\"Stylistically, I'm going for an entirely different look from anything I've ever done, or anything you'd expect me to do.\\" To do this DeMartini explained that he had their casting director Cathy Henderson-Martin go through 2,000 people with Hooper and DeMartini meeting a few hundred. Hooper compared the characters in the film to Deliverance as the film becomes about survival. The screenplay was written by Michael D. Weiss, Adam Gierasch, and Jace Anderson which Thomas Crow of Fangoria stated that Hooper had \\"tinkered with\\". Hooper stated that \\"On paper, something may look good, but things change. Speaking in broad strokes, we've been reshaping some of the dialogue [to suit the actors]. The idea on the page will certainly get to the screen, but I'm aiming for spontaneity.\\" Hooper described doing a second film film about crocodiles after Eaten Alive, describing the film as a campfire film with a \\"mythological background. There's a legend connected with it. Every town in American seems to have some story of lake or woods with a monster in it.\\" Release Crocodile was released direct-to-video on DVD on December 26, 2000. Crocodile was included on a DVD box set from Trimark in October 9, 2001 that included King Cobra, Octopus and Spiders. Crocodile was followed-up with Crocodile 2: Death Swamp also for Nu Image. Director Gary Jones said the film was \\"not really a sequel. It doesn't follow the poltline, characters or anything. It's a totally new story, except that one of the characters happens to be a crocodile.\\" Reception From contemporary reviews, Joseph O'Brien of Rue Morgue declared that \\"There are occasional flashes of Hooper's brand of weirdness\\" noting a scene where a croc hunter attacks the beast that killed his father, but that the film was like an episode of \\"Dawson's Creek where most of the cast are munched by a big reptile; a not-unrewarding experience if viewed in this light.\\" and that \\"Ultimately though, even the good bits are only good enough to make you wish you were watching Alligator or maybe even Lake Placid, instead.\\" Will Wilson of Deep Red gave the film a one out of four rating, stating that \\"the degree to which Tobe Hooper continues to mar his early cinematic legacy is alarming. His once imposing filmic reputation suffers another deadly blow with this stuff, an as by-the-numbers film as one can get.\\" Wilson declared that \\"arguing that Hooper has lost it is rather a redundant point. We all know he has. It is just how far he has plummeted that is shocking.\\" From retrospective reviews, Matthew Chernov of Variety placed the film on their list of top ten alligator films at number 8, noting it was not as strong as Eaten Alive, but that it had a \\"cheesy charm that's undeniable.\\" and was better than the \\"SyFy Channel movies it occasionally resembles [...] Despite some dodgy CGI effects, Hooper's talent behind the camera shines through.\\" See also * List of killer crocodile films References =Sources=   External links * Films about crocodilians 2000 horror films American monster movies American films American natural horror films Nu Image films American independent films Giant monster films Films directed by Tobe Hooper Films set in California 2000 films Direct-to-video horror films American direct-to-video films ","title":"Crocodile (2000 film)"},{"id":"5707606","text":"Bengt Eriksson (22 January 1931 ‚Äì 19 November 2014) was a Swedish nordic combined skier.

Rail transport in Costa Rica is primarily under the stewardship of Incofer (Instituto Costarricense de Ferrocarriles), an autonomous institution of the state. Incofer owns the national railway infrastructure and operates virtually all freight and passenger services, which consist primarily of commuter trains through the highly populated Central Valley. The whole Incofer network is narrow gauge, although there are several small tourist railways of other gauges. Unfortunately, much of the railway system requires major repairs.http://www.infrastructure- intelligence.com/article/aug-2016/infrastructure-costa- rica%E2%80%99s-achilles%E2%80%99-heel An August 2016 OECD report provided this summary about the infrastructure, including the railways: \\"The road network is extensive but of poor quality, railways are in disrepair and only slowly being reactivated after having been shut down in the 1990s ...

The railroad from Alajuela to San Jos√© was completed by the beginning of 1873 and later continued until Cartago. Materials and equipment were brought into Alajuela from Puntarenas by oxen-powered carts. Due to a shortage of finances and natural obstacles (especially around R√≠o Sucio), the construction of the remaining sections was delayed, and the entire line did not become operational until December 7, 1890. Steam locomotive F.C. al P. no 1 Maria Cecilia in San Jose A contract for the building of the Pacific Railroad was signed in 1897, but again, the enterprise faced natural, financial and political difficulties. The Pacific Railroad was officially launched on July 23, 1910, when the first Pennsylvania-built steam locomotive, , named after the granddaughter of former President Rafael Iglesias, departed from Puntarenas to San Jos√© with passengers and cargo. The transcontinental railway from Limon to Puntarenas became operational in 1910 and was central for the connection of the various fertile regions of the country, as well as linking Nicaraguan and Panamanian railways. The route followed the Atlantic coast until the small port of Matina, before it passed inland to Reventaz√≥n River. From there, it bifurcated to cross the northern mountains, with one branch going north of Iraz√∫ and the other traversing the Ochomogo Pass. At San Jos√©, these lines reunited and the railway continued onto Alajuela, the small Pacific port of Tivives and Puntarenas. The railroad was jointly owned by the state and the Costa Rica railway company, with the latter behind the 1904 arrangement to build several branch lines through the banana districts of the Atlantic littoral. In 1926, a decision was made to electrify the lines, and the first electric train ran from San Jos√© to Puntarenas on April 8, 1930. The Costa Rican railroad network was damaged during an earthquake in 1991 and its operation was suspended in 1995. Since 2000, Incofer has been working to recommence and popularize rail transport again. =Jamaican Railroad Workers= Henry Meiggs Keith, an American hired by the Costa Rican government, was in charge of railroad construction to the Atlantic Ocean. Keith insisted on utilizing \\"black\\" (later known as Afro-American) workers for clearing the forest and building the railroad tracks, and in 1872 the first group of Jamaicans entered the country. These Jamaicans and their descendants would become the main inhabitants of the region, thereby establishing a culture that was unique within Costa Rica. Two large Jamaican migrations occurred; firstly, during the railroad construction era, and then in the next century, for the banana plantations owned by the United Standard Fruit Company. =Italian Railroad Workers= San Vito area Groups of Italian workers were hired to work in the construction of the Costa Rica's railways in the first years of the 20th century. Some of them remained to live in Costa Rica and a few of their descendants moved to the San Vito area in the mid 1950s. These agricultural colonists had to confront many problems, especially due to the isolation of this region. Nevertheless, from 1964 on, the production of coffee caused the outlook to change for the better: 500 Italian colonists and many Costa Ricans (someone descendants from the Italian rail workers) from different parts of the country were attracted by the economic possibilities that the area offered. = Current status = Although it once connected the Caribbean ports of Limon and Moin with the Pacific port of Caldera, traversing the Central Valley area and Costa Rica's largest cities along the route, the system fell into disrepair towards the end of the 20th century following a financial crisis that saw the President of Costa Rica, Jos√© Mar√≠a Figueres, order the cessation of Incofer's commercial activity, resulting in the redundancies of most of its workforce except for a select few who were charged with preserving railway assets. However, operations were never fully suspended, and there was always at least the occasional freight and maintenance traffic along certain parts of the network. Some other parts, on the other hand, were essentially abandoned until 2005 when urban passenger services were reintroduced along a corridor between the suburbs of Pavas, to the west of San Jos√©, and San Pedro, to the east. Since then, services have been greatly increased following investment in second-hand DMUs imported from Spain and the rehabilitation of dozens of kilometres of previously inoperative track. , the bulk of railway operations occur in the Central Valley area and consist of passenger services between the San Jos√© suburbs of Pavas, Curridabat and Belen, and between San Jos√© and the cities of Heredia and Cartago. Work is now under way to rehabilitate further sections beyond these main termini, such as between Heredia and Alajuela, and from Cartago to Paraiso, in order to extend the existing services. Trains (particularly freight trains, as well as a privately operated tour train) ran between San Jos√© and the port of Caldera until 2011, when a short section of the line was compromised following the construction of Route 27. This prompted a dispute between Incofer and the highway developer, Autopistas del Sol. This dispute has not yet been resolved and Incofer officials have been quoted as saying that while they are technically able to run trains over the damaged section, it is dangerous to do so. Unfortunately, the resulting lack of regular traffic on this line has facilitated the theft of rails. Visitors to Costa Rica may perceive the railway as being somewhat limited compared to other forms of transport, due to the current lack of anything except a basic commuter service.  Passenger rail  While mainly freight lines, there were passenger services to the Pacific since 1910 and to the Caribbean since 1890 from San Jos√©, but these were abandoned and under maintained. Only the remnants of the urban areas remain. By reconditioning and restoring the railway tracks in the Greater Metropolitan Area, Incofer was able to put into work a commuter line, the Tren Interurbano, which connects the provinces of Alajuela, Heredia, San Jos√© and Cartago.  Freight transport  * Freight trains San Jos√© - Caldera (Incofer) * Freight trains from Puerto Lim√≥n to Fortuna and towards Gu√°piles, mainly for banana transportation, as from 2007 on steel and construction materials have been added to the freight transported  International connections  There was a railway connection in the Caribbean over the Sixaola River between Panama and Costa Rica. The bridge collapsed in 2017. In 2018, China donated to Panama a factibility plan to open a high speed train between Panama and Costa Rica, but by 2019, the plan was rejected. As of 2020 there are no current or planned connections to Panama or Nicaragua.  Inter- oceanic Dry Canal  There are plans and studies regarding the construction of an inter-oceanic dry canal () across the country, from the Caribbean sea to the Pacific ocean, through the northern plains of the country, in a similar and parallel route to the Route 4 road. The main way of merchandise transportation would be using railroad to transport container, with plans to build ten road lanes alongside the railroad tracks, two new ports on each coast terminus.

Splice site consensus sequences that drive exon recognition are located at the very termini of introns. The deletion of the splicing site results in one or more introns remaining in mature mRNA and may lead to the production of abnormal proteins. When a splice site mutation occurs, the mRNA transcript possesses information from these introns that normally should not be included. Introns are supposed to be removed, while the exons are expressed. The mutation must occur at the specific site at which intron splicing occurs: within non-coding sites in a gene, directly next to the location of the exon. The mutation can be an insertion, deletion, frameshift, etc. The splicing process itself is controlled by the given sequences, known as splice-donor and splice-acceptor sequences, which surround each exon. Mutations in these sequences may lead to retention of large segments of intronic DNA by the mRNA, or to entire exons being spliced out of the mRNA. These changes could result in production of a nonfunctional protein. An intron is separated from its exon by means of the splice site. Acceptor-site and donor-site relating to the splice sites signal to the spliceosome where the actual cut should be made. These donor sites, or recognition sites, are essential in the processing of mRNA. The average vertebrate gene consists of multiple small exons (average size, 137 nucleotides) separated by introns that are considerably larger. A visual representation of a splice site mutation instance Background In 1993, Richard J. Roberts and Phillip Allen Sharp received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of \\"split genes\\". Using the model adenovirus in their research, they were able to discover splicing‚Äîthe fact that pre-mRNA is processed into mRNA once introns were removed from the RNA segment. These two scientists discovered the existence of splice sites, thereby changing the face of genomics research. They also discovered that the splicing of the messenger RNA can occur in different ways, opening up the possibility for a mutation to occur. Technology Today, many different types of technologies exist in which splice sites can be located and analyzed for more information. The Human Splicing Finder is an online database stemming from the Human Genome Project data. The genome database identifies thousands of mutations related to medical and health fields, as well as providing critical research information regarding splice site mutations. The tool specifically searches for pre-mRNA splicing errors, the calculation of potential splice sites using complex algorithms, and correlation with several other online genomic databases, such as the Ensembl genome browser. Role in Disease Due to the sensitive location of splice sites, mutations in the acceptor or donor areas of splice sites can become detrimental to a human individual. In fact, many different types of diseases stem from anomalies within the splice sites. = Cancer = A study researching the role of splice site mutations in cancer supported that a splice site mutation was common in a set of women who were positive for breast and ovarian cancer. These women had the same mutation, according to the findings. An intronic single base-pair substitution destroys an acceptor site, thus activating a cryptic splice site, leading to a 59 base-pair insertion and chain termination. The four families with both breast and ovarian cancer had chain termination mutations in the N-terminal half of the protein. The mutation in this research example was located within the splice-site. =Dementia= According to a research study conducted Hutton, M et al, a missense mutation occurring on the 5' region of the RNA associated with the tau protein was found to be correlated with inherited dementia (known as FTDP-17). The splice-site mutations all destabilize a potential stem‚Äìloop structure which is most likely involved in regulating the alternative splicing of exon10 in chromosome 17. Consequently, more usage occurs on the 5' splice site and an increased proportion of tau transcripts that include exon 10 are created. Such drastic increase in mRNA will increase the proportion of Tau containing four microtubule-binding repeats, which is consistent with the neuropathology described in several families with FTDP-17, a type inherited dementia. =Epilepsy= Some types of epilepsy may be brought on due to a splice site mutation. In addition to a mutation in a stop codon, a splice site mutation on the 3' strand was found in a gene coding for cystatin B in Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy patients. This combination of mutations was not found in unaffected individuals. By comparing sequences with and without the splice site mutation, investigators were able to determine that a G-to-C nucleotide transversion occurs at the last position of the first intron. This transversion occurs in the region that codes for the cystatin B gene. Individuals suffering from Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy possess a mutated form of this gene, which results in decreased output of mature mRNA, and subsequently decreases in protein expression. A study has also shown that a type of Childhood Absence Epilepsy (CAE) causing febrile seizures may be linked to a splice site mutation in the sixth intron of the GABRG2 gene. This splice site mutation was found to cause a nonfunctional GABRG2 subunit in affected individuals. According to this study, a point mutation was the culprit for the splice-donor site mutation, which occurred in intron 6. A nonfunctional protein product is produced, leading to the also nonfunctional subunit. =Hematological Disorders= Several genetic diseases may be the result of splice site mutations. For example, mutations that cause the incorrect splicing of Œ≤-globin mRNA are responsible of some cases of Œ≤-thalassemia. Another Example is TTP (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura). TTP is caused by deficiency of ADAMTS-13. A splice site mutation of ADAMTS-13 gene can therefore cause TTP. It is estimated that 15% of all point mutations causing human genetic diseases occur within a splice site. =Parathyroid Deficiency= When a splice site mutation occurs in intron 2 of the gene that produces the parathyroid hormone, a parathyroid deficiency can prevail. In one particular study, a G to C substitution in the splice site of intron 2 produces a skipping effect in the messenger RNA transcript. The exon that is skipped possesses the initiation start codon to produce parathyroid hormone. Such failure in initiation causes the deficiency. Analysis Using the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, data has been compiled regarding the genomic information and sequencing of this organism. A prediction model exists in which a researcher can upload his or her genomic information and use a splice site prediction database to gather information about where the splice sites could be located. The Berkeley Drosophila Project can be used to incorporate this research, as well as annotate high quality euchromatic data. The splice site predictor can be a great tool for researchers studying human disease in this model organism. Splice site mutations can be analyzed using information theory.

One of the tallest buildings in the neighborhood, it serves primarily as a residence hall for Columbia undergraduates, although it also contains a small hotel, the university's Center for Career Education, its Facilities Management office, and the Heyman Center for the Humanities. East Campus, a $28.7 million facility, was designed by Gwathmey Siegel & Associates Architects and built in 1979-1982.  History  An earlier plan for East Campus (1965), by Harrison and Abromowitz architects, included twin concrete slab towers.Unbuilt: Original East Campus Proposal at Morningside Heights neighborhood website Along with the rest of the ambitious expansion plans of University President Grayson L. Kirk, it was scrapped in the wake of the 1968 protests against, among other things, a university gym proposed for nearby Morningside Park. When expansion finally did reach East Campus, by the late 1970s, the university was seeking a more humanist design, one which would both harmonize better with the surrounding campus and reflect, to some degree, the residential college quads of Oxford and Yale. When East Campus opened, students appreciated its expansive suite space, commanding views, and spacious townhouses, which were a relieving contrast to cramped conditions in much of the rest of the university's housing. Many of the outer townhouses were donated and built by famous Columbia University benefactors. The most notable of these is Thomas J. Watson, Jr. who donated the popular Watson House. Donor George Delacorte, for whom the building's central courtyard is formally named, said of his former room at the university \\"we had two nails on the wall for a closet...now I've paid for a dormitory where boys loll around in marble bathtubs.\\" The bathrooms are not, however, actually marble, but imitate that material.\\"Columbia Dedicates New Suites and Townhouses for Students\\" in the New York Times, June 4, 1981 On October 10, 1985, a Columbia engineering student, Sarah M. Thomas, was stabbed in her East Campus suite by an intruder, a man who had been signed in as a guest by another resident. It was one of a number of violent crimes in the Columbia dormitories during the 1980s.\\"Intruder Stabs Student in Columbia Dormitory\\" by Keith Schneider in the New York Times, October 11, 1985 An inspection in 1987 revealed that the tiled exterior which had earned the building accolades had begun to peel off its facade, and a large chunk collapsed into its courtyard in February 1988, prompting the university to order its recladding, a $15 million project handled by the architects Gruzon Sampton Steinglass, in the campus' traditional red brick and limestone. In the course of the scandal, Columbia sued both Gwathmey Siegel and the engineering firm that had worked on the project.\\"Columbia Dormitory, A New Facade,\\" in the New York Times, June 23, 1991 In 2006, a homophobic message written on a dry-erase board in East Campus was denounced as a hate crime, the sixth one alleged that year, and prompted the creation of the controversial student group Stop Hate on Columbia's Campus (SHOCC).  Architecture  East Campus was originally clad in red and white tiles, a surfacing architectural critics praised as innovative. The American Institute of Architects Guide to New York City called it \\"elegant and handsome\\". Reception to the building was mixed overall. Architecture critic Ada Louise Huxtable wrote of East Campus: \\"Consider a building that has to be vandal-proof, constructed of maintenance-free materials, with every surface resistant to neglect and abuse, where violation of design and function must be an anticipated fact, along with defacement and petty thievery - a place where surveillance is a necessity and the population is transient. A description of a maximum security prison? Not at all. This is a dormitory at Columbia University.\\" \\"Architecture View: An Ingenious Advance in Housing Design\\" by Louise Huxtable in the New York Times, October 4, 1981  Notable residents  East Campus was home to writer and musician Michael Azerrad, US presidential adviser and television news personality George Stephanopoulos, and actors Matthew Fox, Julia Stiles and Rider Strong. Political cartoonist Ted Rall also lived in East Campus, but was kicked out after targeting pedestrians below his window with water balloons.Fatal Defenstration: Men Who Love Gravity Too Much on Ted Rall's website Recently, however, the building has begun to show signs of aging, with frequent flooding leading to many displeased undergraduate upperclassmen.

He was the lead guitarist of the rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars from 2003 to 2018. Born in Sarajevo but raised in the United States, Miliƒçeviƒá moved to Troy, Michigan in the early 1980s, where he became active in the local heavy metal scene and played in a number of bands, co-founding Morphic. In 2003, he joined Thirty Seconds to Mars, with whom he achieved worldwide recognition in the mid-2000s after recording the band's second album A Beautiful Lie (2005). Its full-length follow-ups, This Is War (2009) and Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams (2013), received further critical and commercial success. Miliƒçeviƒá has also worked as a collaborator and music producer. Throughout the 2010s, he was featured on a recording with Dommin and collaborated with Ivy Levan on a number of releases, including Introducing the Dame (2013) and No Good (2015). Miliƒçeviƒá has experimented with various guitar effects and introduced influences from several genres of music into his own style.  Early life  Tomo Miliƒçeviƒá was born on September 3, 1979 in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, then part of SFR Yugoslavia, to a Croatian family. He is the middle child of Tonka and Damir Miliƒçeviƒá. He has an elder sister, Ivana, and a younger brother, Filip. His father worked in agricultural engineering and his mother was a doctor. His family first arrived in the United States in 1982, where Miliƒçeviƒá's brother Filip was born. They traveled back and forth until they permanently emigrated to Troy, Michigan when Miliƒçeviƒá enrolled in the third grade, to avoid the Bosnian War. He stated that he \\"would be in the army by 16, fighting in the front lines by age 17\\" if his family had not emigrated. After moving to the United States, both his parents worked in manufacturing industries in Troy and Detroit. A few years later, they started their own business. Miliƒçeviƒá became interested in classical music at early age, when he started to take violin lessons inspired by his uncle ≈Ωeljko \\"Bill\\" Miliƒçeviƒá, a virtuoso violinist and professor of music at Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan. \\"I was actually born and bred to be a concert violinist\\", he explained. Miliƒçeviƒá's introduction to the world of heavy metal music was around the age of 11. His parents supported his decision to start playing guitar, so he and his father made one together. He began writing his own music in high school, while at the same time performing in a number of local bands. Miliƒçeviƒá gained American citizenship in the early 1990s. He attended culinary school at Oakland Community College, becoming a certified executive and pastry chef, and worked in a number of restaurants in Metro Detroit. He graduated from Athens High School in Troy and then moved to Los Angeles, rejoining his siblings Ivana and Filip. The three later convinced their parents to leave Troy and resettle in Los Angeles, where they opened a restaurant.  Career  Miliƒçeviƒá began playing in bands around Troy in the late 1990s. He co-founded the group Morphic with some friends in 2000. The band first operated under the name Loki, before settling on its final name. By 2001, the group performed gigs at small Michigan venues and clubs, and recorded a number of demo tracks. The following year, Miliƒçeviƒá left the band and was almost ready to quit his musical career. However, during this period, manager Arthur Spivak, who had previously met Miliƒçeviƒá at a showcase concert with Morphic, told him about an audition for Thirty Seconds to Mars. Miliƒçeviƒá then decided to move to Los Angeles where he had a successful audition with Thirty Seconds to Mars, replacing guitarist Solon Bixler. By 2003, the band consisted of Miliƒçeviƒá, lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Jared Leto, drummer Shannon Leto, and bassist Matt Wachter. The new lineup debuted on The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn in February 2003. Miliƒçeviƒá performing in Padova, Italy in July 2013 Thirty Seconds to Mars entered the studio in March 2004 to begin working on their second album A Beautiful Lie. The recording process saw the band traveling to four different continents to accommodate Jared Leto's acting career. A Beautiful Lie was released on August 30, 2005 in the United States. Fueled by the band's relentless touring and the mainstream success of the single \\"The Kill\\", the album received multiple certifications all over the world, including platinum in the United States, with a worldwide sales total of over four million. The album tour saw the band playing at several major festivals, including Roskilde, Pinkpop, Rock am Ring, and Download. In August 2008, during the recording process of the band's third studio album, Thirty Seconds to Mars attempted to sign with a new label, prompting EMI (the parent label of Virgin), to file a $30 million breach of contract lawsuit. After nearly a year of legal battles, the band announced on April 28, 2009, that the suit had been settled following a defense based on the De Havilland Law. Thirty Seconds to Mars then signed a new contract with EMI and released their third album This Is War in December 2009 to critical acclaim. This Is War reached the top ten of several national album charts and earned numerous music awards. The band began their Into the Wild Tour in support of the record in February 2010 and was among the hardest-working touring artists of the year. In December 2011, they entered the Guinness World Records for most live shows during a single album cycle, with 300 shows. Miliƒçeviƒá collaborated with American band Dommin on a rendition of Cutting Crew's song \\"(I Just) Died in Your Arms\\", which was released on a special edition of Dommin's album Love Is Gone (2010). He began producing American singer Ivy Levan in 2012. After signing to Cherrytree Records, Levan released the EP Introducing the Dame (2013), which features a collaboration with Miliƒçeviƒá, who wrote and produced a number of tracks. Thirty Seconds to Mars released their fourth album, Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams, in May 2013 through Universal. It received generally positive reviews and reached the top ten in more than fifteen countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States. The band promoted the album by embarking on their Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams Tour and the Carnivores Tour, co-headlining with Linkin Park. In April 2014, Thirty Seconds to Mars announced that they have parted from Virgin Records after tumultuous years with the label. The following year, Miliƒçeviƒá engineered Ivy Levan's debut album No Good alongside Patrick Nissley. He also wrote and performed on selected tracks. Thirty Seconds to Mars released their fifth album, America, in April 2018 through Interscope. During the Monolith Tour in support of the album, it was announced that Miliƒçeviƒá would be taking a break from touring due to personal matters. In June 2018, he officially announced his departure from the band.  Artistry  Miliƒçeviƒá is a classically trained musician who began his musical education at a very early age, playing the violin. During his youth, he had been influenced by jazz and classical music, listening to performers such as St√©phane Grappelli, John McLaughlin, Paco de Luc√≠a, and Al Di Meola. His own ethnic background, and the diverse social and cultural mix in and around Detroit, were crucial in the formation of Miliƒçeviƒá as a musician. He developed his interest in guitar from the moment he was introduced to heavy metal music, becoming a devoted fan of bands such as Pantera, Metallica, and Slayer. When he started writing his own music, Miliƒçeviƒá regarded Pantera's album Vulgar Display of Power as a particularly influential record. He was further drawn into guitar when he realized the \\"genius\\" of emotions and passions which characterizes the common songwriting of rock music. Miliƒçeviƒá explained, \\"All of the music that I have ever listened to, in some shape or form, has inspired me to do music\\". He grew up listening to progressive rock and blues artists, citing Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, and Led Zeppelin. His major influences also include alternative rock bands such as Nirvana and The Smashing Pumpkins. He is inspired by electronic music, including The Cure and Depeche Mode. Miliƒçeviƒá explained that when making music his passion for the creative process is what drives his works and allows to constantly reinvent his style. Rod Lockwood from The Blade described his work as \\"propulsive and energetic, with a big, anthemic sound that draws on U2, The Cure, and classic rock for its aural infrastructure\\". Artistdirect complimented the \\"beautifully complex guitars\\" featured on the album A Beautiful Lie. A writer from the Chicago Music Guide commended the \\"imaginative effects\\" on This Is War, while Guitar Edge stated that the guitar work on the album is \\"in a class of its own\\", noticing \\"rich atmospheres\\" and \\"masterful guitar tone\\". Miliƒçeviƒá experimented with different instruments and drew influences from a varied range of styles in Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams. In addition to the guitar and violin, Miliƒçeviƒá is also a fluent player of bass instruments, keyboards and percussion, and supplies backing vocals during concerts.  Personal life  Miliƒçeviƒá's immediate family includes his sister, actress Ivana, and his late brother, photographer Filip. He is a nephew of ≈Ωeljko \\"Bill\\" Miliƒçeviƒá, professor of music at Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan. Miliƒçeviƒá married his longtime girlfriend Vicki Bosanko in Crete, Greece in July 2011. After living in Los Angeles for over a decade, Miliƒçeviƒá came back to Michigan in August 2014, moving to Indian Village in Detroit with his wife. He described himself as a \\"Michigan kid\\" who grew up with the music scene of Detroit. He also explained to have a \\"deep-rooted affinity\\" for the city. Miliƒçeviƒá lives a vegan lifestyle and supports animal rights. He worked with the Best Friends Animal Society on a number of programs. In the 2008 presidential election, Miliƒçeviƒá supported Senator Barack Obama of Illinois.

They have appeared in Uncanny X-Men within the Marvel Comics universe. They were created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Dave Cockrum. Many of them were enslaved by the Brood empire. Physical characteristics The Acanti roughly resemble whales. They are a reddish-brown color. They have dorsal, ventral, lateral, and caudal fins, as well as green eyes widely spaced on their heads. The Acanti are large space-faring creatures most closely resembling Earth's whale shark. An adult Acanti can grow to a few kilometers in length, and even an infant is large enough to swallow a 15-person spaceship with room to take in at least four more. They are sentient creatures which communicate through psionic sounds referred to as songs. Acanti have the innate ability to fly faster than the speed of light, without technological assistance. Fictional race biography According to myth, the Acanti are an ancient species which peacefully wandered through space, benevolent and compassionate by nature. The Acanti were led by one individual known as the Prophet-Singer. The Prophet- Singer was the repository of the Acanti's racial Soul, a collective semi- mystical force that linked and motivated the Acanti species. As death approached, the Acanti typically hurled themselves into stars. The Prophet- Singer of each generation would also do so, releasing the Soul to join the body of the next Prophet-Singer. Upon migrating to the Milky Way galaxy, the Brood began to enslave the Acanti to take advantage of their natural ability to travel at speeds exceeding light. The Brood would infect individual Acanti with a disease known as the Slaver Virus, which would destroy the higher cognitive functions of their minds, making them ripe for easy control. Then, the Brood would transform the mindless husks into living starships. The Brood succeeded in enslaving the Acanti Prophet-Singer, and when he eventually died and crashed on a planet, its body was reconstructed as the \\"throne city\\" (presumably like a capital) on the planet (referred to as \\"Broodworld\\" or \\"Sleazeworld\\") that the Brood then established as the center of their empire. Thus, the Soul remained trapped in the skull of the dead Prophet-Singer. Salvation for the Acanti came when a new Prophet-Singer was born, however, without transferring the soul to him, the Acanti were still stuck near Sleazeworld. During the X-Men's first conflict with the Brood the X-Men had been abducted and infected by the Brood and brought to their homeworld. Carol Danvers (formerly Ms. Marvel) became linked with a white hole and transformed into Binary. The process made her temporarily insane, and she blasted out of Lilandra's yacht, causing an explosive decompression that sucked Storm into space, where she was found by the newborn Prophet-Singer, whose mother had just been enslaved by the Brood. Storm herself was now becoming a Brood as the egg began to hatch. The Prophet-Singer saved Storm (who had destroyed the egg and critically wounded herself).Uncanny X-Men #165 (January 1983). Other Acanti merged Storm's consciousness with that of the Prophet-Singer while Storm's body healed in a cocoon within him. The Acanti saved Storm, entering into a symbiotic relationship in which the Acanti healed Storm's body, purging it of the Brood embryo, and Storm's experienced mind provided a source of focus and strength for the baby Prophet-Singer. The Acanti then swallowed Liliandra's yacht, masking it from Brood sensors while the crew effected repairs. The X-Men then agreed to release the Soul from Broodworld. After a battle against the Brood, Binary succeeded in releasing the Soul from the crystalline room in which it was trapped. The foul nature of the Brood Queen and the embryos within the X-Men immediately resonated as black pools throughout the chamber. The grateful Soul purged the X-Men of the Brood embryos and transformed the Brood Queen into pure inanimate crystal. The Soul united with the young Prophet-Singer, who assumed leadership of the Acanti.Uncanny X-Men #166 (February 1983). Recently, however, the Brood attempted to invade Earth using a fleet of Acanti ships, though ones without external domes. It is unknown whether these were leftovers from before the X-Men freed the Prophet-Singer, or whether the Brood have continued their depredations on the Acanti even afterwards. The fleet was scared away from Earth with a telepathic illusion of the Phoenix Force and Galactus. One Acanti was obtained by Roxxon Energy Corporation. With a riding device added to it, the Acanti was controlled by an unidentified Brood-infected human working for Dario Agger in his plot to hire Weapon H into working for Roxxon. Weapon H used his punch to defeat the Acanti.Weapon H #1. Marvel Comics. Ultimate Marvel Although not named, in the Ultimate Fantastic Four #35 (Dec. 2006) there is a huge alien creature, used by the Acheron Empire, ruled by Thanos, that resembles the Acanti. Other media An Acanti appears in the X-Men episode \\"Love in Vain\\". Enslaved by the Brood (here called \\"The Colony\\") to be their vessel, it is freed when Professor X uses his psychic powers to break the Brood's control. The Brood cannot stand the Acanti's song while the X-Man Rogue finds it beautiful.

The name originates from the fact that the DuPont company arranged the sale of the original tract to the state. Adjacent tracts have since been purchased and added to the state forest. Portions of the forest formerly contained a manufacturing facility for the production of X-ray film. The forest was used to shoot scenes from the 1992 film The Last of the Mohicans as well as the 2012 box office hit The Hunger Games. On February 12, 2019, the forest added from Conserving Carolina, part of a section called the Continental Divide Tract that connects with other public lands. 314 more acres will be added to the forest by the end of 2019.  History  Before 1996, the area that is DuPont state forest today, Buck Forest, was owned by Dupont, who ran a plant on the property, until it was sold to Sterling Diagnostic Imaging. The remainder of the land was sold to the state of North Carolina, which created DuPont State Forest. However, the original state forest was much smaller than it is today. Later, in 2000, 500 acres were added to the forest. In 1999, Sterling held a private bid for 2,223 out of the 2,700 acres the company had acquired. The state and several conservation groups tried to obtain it, but were unsuccessful. The property was eventually acquired by a developer named Jim Anthony. When the property was sold, Sterling prohibited the land from being used for private development. Anthony stated that he was not planning to develop the property, even though it was obvious based on the improvements he was making to the property. The conservation groups also learned around this time that the restrictions were unenforceable, and that the Landowner could do whatever they wanted with the land. Despite the efforts of the conservation groups, Anthony continued to develop the property, and eventually divided it into lots. Following this, on October 23, 2000, Governor Jim Hunt and the North Carolina Council of State voted to condemn the property. The state paid Anthony $24 million USD for the property, then it was absorbed into DuPont State Forest. In 2019, Conserving Carolina gave the forest several hundred acres of land in the continental divide tract. Recreation Nearly of multi- use trails and roads thread through the forest. The forest is widely used for many recreational activities, including mountain biking, hiking, horseback riding, swimming (where permitted), wading, and kayaking. Destinations include mountaintop views (such as from the summit of Stone Mountain, and Cedar Rock), lakes (such as Lake Imaging, Lake Julia, Lake Dense, and Fawn Lake), and waterfalls, including: * Bridal Veil Falls * Grassy Creek Falls * High Falls * Hooker Falls * Triple Falls * Wintergreen Falls Popular mountain biking trails include Ridgeline, Big Rock, Cedar Rock, and Airstrip trails. The Airstrip trail starts from near a small unused (or emergency use) airplane landing area. The Ridgeline trail is particularly noted for its long continuous, winding and uninterrupted run, with a mild downhill grade.

Salinger has had a lasting influence as it remains both a bestseller and a frequently challenged book. Alternate URL. Numerous works in popular culture have referenced the novel. Factors contributing to the novel's mystique and impact include its portrayal of protagonist Holden Caulfield; its tone of sincerity; its themes of familial neglect, tension between teens and society, and rebellion; its previous banned status; and Salinger's reclusiveness. The Catcher in the Rye has inspired \\"rewrites\\" which have been said to form their own genre. On the other hand, there are examples of similarities between the novel and other works that were not intended by their authors, which suggests that the novel is \\"present, at least spiritually, in ... any story line that involves quirky young people struggling to find their places in a society prone to reward conformity and condemn individuality.\\" While the novel is linked to several murders and murder attempts, it has been claimed that the novel's overall effect on society is \\"far more positive than negative.\\" The novel also helped popularize the slang verb \\"screw up\\". In recent years there has been a discussion of depression as exhibited in Holden Caulfield. Shootings The best-known event associated with The Catcher in the Rye is arguably Mark David Chapman's shooting of John Lennon. Chapman identified with the novel's narrator to the extent that he wanted to change his name to Holden Caulfield. On the night he shot Lennon, Chapman was found with a copy of the book in which he had written \\" _This_ is my statement\\" and signed Holden's name. Later, he read a passage from the novel to address the court during his sentencing.Whitfield, 571‚Äì572. Daniel Stashower speculated that Chapman had wanted Lennon's innocence to be preserved by death, inspired by Holden's wish to preserve children's innocence despite Holden's later realization that children should be left alone. After John Hinckley, Jr.'s assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan in 1981, police found The Catcher in the Rye in his hotel room. Whitfield, 572. Hinckley later admitted to being an admirer of Chapman and studying his attempt on John Lennon. Hinckley's possession of the novel was later dismissed as an influence, as a half dozen various other types of books were also discovered in his possession. Robert John Bardo, who murdered Rebecca Schaeffer, was carrying the book when he visited Schaeffer's apartment in Hollywood on July 18, 1989 and murdered her. Christopher Buckley made reference to these shootings in a 1995 commencement speech at his alma mater of Portsmouth Abbey School, where he commented on Chapman's possession of the book and later remarked \\"Catcher in the Rye is a fine piece of literature and well worth your time, if you have not so read it already. So long as does not inspire you to shoot any of the remaining Beatles.\\" Films Although Salinger had refused a film adaptation, many Hollywood films have based characters on Holden Caulfield. Holden has been identified as \\"one of the most reproduced characters on film.\\" Furthermore, many such films reference each other. Anthony Caputi, a specialist in dramatic literature at Cornell University, claims that the novel inspires both \\"variations\\" and \\"imitations\\", comparing it with several coming-of-age films. * In The Collector (1965), which is based on the John Fowles novel, Clegg cannot understand why Miranda likes The Catcher in the Rye. * In the 1990 play and 1993 film Six Degrees of Separation, the impostor Paul gives an analysis on the novel in a monologue. According to him, the novel, a \\"manifesto of hate\\" against phonies, would have been the excuse or defenseWhitfield, 573. for Chapman and Hinckley's shootings. * In Conspiracy Theory (1997), Mel Gibson's character is programmed to buy the novel whenever he sees it, though he never actually reads it. * Chasing Holden (2001) is named after Holden Caulfield. The protagonist Neil relates his life to Holden's, skips class to go to New York City, goes on a road trip to New Hampshire to find Salinger, and contemplates killing Salinger. * Screenwriter Mike White regards the novel as \\"part of a literary trend that goes back to Goethe's The Sorrows of Werther (1774) ... I don't think Salinger discovered it. He just did the quintessential American version.\\" He thought the influence of the novel may rise in Hollywood, and two of his 2002 films reflect this. In Orange County, protagonist Shaun searches for the professor who wrote the book that changed his life. * In The Good Girl, protagonist Thomas Worther calls himself Holden and is seen reading the novel. * Igby Goes Down (2002), originally intended to be a novel, has been interpreted as being inspired by The Catcher in the Rye, but director and screenwriter Burr Steers said it is not a direct influence and the story is more of an autobiography. On the influence of the book, Steers \\"liken[s] it to being a musician and being influenced by the music ingrained in you, like the Beatles.\\" * The Catcher in the Rye deeply influenced the 2017 biographical drama film Rebel in the Rye, which is about Salinger. It is a visual about his life, before and after World War II, and gives more about the author's life than the readers of The Catcher in the Rye learned from the novel. Television * The main plot for the Japanese anime television series Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex (2002) hinges on elements from The Catcher in the Rye from which a character uses a digital logo representing Holden Caulfield, and the quote \\"I thought what I'd do was, I'd pretend I was one of those deaf-mutes.\\" These themes and some additional quotes are also expressed in Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG (2004), although the characters and plot have changed. * South Park episode \\"The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs\\" (2010) makes particular reference to The Catcher in the Rye and shows that its once- controversial use of vocabulary has no impact among young readers nowadays, and pokes fun at literary critics reading deeper meaning into books. It also references its connection towards the series of high-profile assassination attempts in the 1980s, with character Butters Stotch expressing a desire to kill John Lennon after reading the book until his father tells him that Lennon was already killed. Books The Catcher in the Rye has had significant cultural influence, and works inspired by the novel have been said to form their own genre. Sarah Graham assessed works influenced by The Catcher in the Rye to include the novels Less Than Zero by Bret Easton Ellis, The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky, A Complicated Kindness by Miriam Toews, The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath, Ordinary People by Judith Guest, and the film Igby Goes Down by Burr Steers. * John Fowles's 1963 novel The Collector uses The Catcher in the Rye as \\"one of the most brilliant examples of adolescence\\" in popular culture, possibly under a moral light.Whitfield, 570. In it, Miranda encourages her kidnapper Clegg to read Catcher, thinking he might relate to Holden's alienation. However, Clegg finds Holden's actions unrealistic given Holden's wealth and status, and \\"[doesn't] see much point in it.\\" In the film adaptation of The Collector, this conversation and Clegg's attitude toward the novel and popular culture is subdued.Whitfield, 571. The novel has itself been linked to several serial killers. * Alberto Fuguet's first novel Mala onda (Bad Vibes, 1991), which is set in Santiago, Chile three months before the John Lennon assassination, references The Catcher in the Rye extensively.Santini, Beno√Æt (2013). Chile en el siglo XXI: ¬øNuevos recorridos art√≠sticos, nuevos caminos hist√≥ricos?. Mago Editores. Like Holden, Mat√≠as Vicu√±a (the 17-year-old narrator and protagonist of the novel) is a cynical, alienated, upper-class teenager who feels fed-up with the blandness of his friends and family. After reading Salinger's book, Mat√≠as feels a special connection with Holden. He attempts to replicate Holden's self-inflicted isolation by fleeing home and locking himself up in a hotel room, and he even purchases a red hunting hat to complete the persona.Fuguet, Alberto (1997). Bad Vibes. St. Martin's Press. * Lawrence Block wrote a novel called Burglar in the Rye (1999) in his series on burglar Bernie Rhodenbarr. The plot focuses on an auction of a reclusive writer's letters, and Bernie works to track down the character based on J. D. Salinger. * In Galt Niederhoffer's novel A Taxonomy of Barnacles (2005), Bridget and Billy think about Holden's question as to the whereabouts of ducks during winter. * John David California wrote 60 Years Later: Coming Through the Rye (2009), an unauthorized sequel in which seventy-six-year-old Holden escapes a retirement home for a journey in New York. Comic strips and magazines * The Frazz character Caulfield is named after Holden. Music * The Ataris' song \\"If You Really Want to Hear About It\\" from their album End is Forever takes its title from the novel's opening sentence. The final lines paraphrase those of the book with \\"Don't ever tell anyone anything or else you'll wind up missing everybody.\\" Several other specific references are made within the lyrics. * Billy Joel's \\"We Didn't Start the Fire\\" mentions the novel as a historic item of note during his lifetime. * Green Day's \\"Who Wrote Holden Caulfield?\\" from their album Kerplunk (1991) is named after and is about the novel's main character, Holden Caulfield.

Demographics India census, Banbasa had a population of 7,990, up from 7,138 in 2001. The human sex ratio of Banbasa is 887, with 52% of the population being Male and other 48% female. Children constitute 12.22% of total population of Banbasa. The literacy rate of Banbasa is 77.19%. The Buksas and Tharus are the native inhabititants of the region. It is located 10 km away from Tanakpur. Banbasa is known for the Banbasa Barrage and Dam across the Sharda river, its canal and what many consider the launching point for the trip up into the mountains on the Holy Purnagiri Pilgrimage. The place abounds in sugarcane, paddy, wheat, mango orchards etc. and has a hot and humid climate, typical of the Terais, during summers, with heavy rains in late summers and hard winters. To enter into Banbassa from Delhi one must pass through a lush 6 km stretch of jungle in which elephants, leopards, tigers, monkeys, bears, snakes, deer and many other species of wild animal are regularly seen. Much of Banbasa's outer population lives in the jungles that surround the town.  The Town & Tourism  Street view of Banbasa While Banbassa has several small hotels, it is not generally considered a 'tourist destination'. The majority of tourists and visitors that arrive in Banbasa are either crossing into Nepal (via Mahendranagar) or heading up in to the Himalayas and its hill stations. A popular place to visit while staying in Banbasa is The Good Shepherd Agricultural Mission, an orphanage home for around 80 orphan children located just 1 km from the town -though visitors must obtain permission prior to visiting via their website. The GSAM is situated on the border of the jungle and has been registered and running since 1948. Banbasa is a popular spot for people to cross into Nepal from India as there is an immigration office for both countries. The Nepal border is about 5 km from Banbasa and rickshaws, tuktuk or horse-drawn carts can be hired with ease. Vehicles can also cross the border into Nepal/India but specific times are held when this can happen (3-4 times per day).  Transport  Buses run direct between Banbasa and Delhi, Agra, Bareilly, Rudrapur, Nanital, Haldwani, Dehradun, Haridwar, Amritsar, Chandigarh, Shimla and many other places. Most services have several timings but some only have 1-3 buses per day. Banbasa is one of the last stops before the Himalayan mountain climb begins on the road to Almorah, Champawat and Pithoragarh. Trains also run to Banbasa, a direct line from Delhi via Bareilly. Banbasa is near India's border with Nepal, across from the Mahendranagar municipality. Nepalese and Indian nationals may cross unrestricted, however there is a customs checkpoint for goods and third country nationals.

He personally explored and photographed all the routes he describes in his famous mountain guides, so that users can be assured of correct directions. His guides were based on earlier books covering most of the mountainous regions of Britain, but exclude routes on less popular mountains such as the Berwyns, and are restricted in areas such as the Black Mountains and Brecon Beacons. He was an accomplished and skilled photographer. He joined the Royal Photographic Society in 1940 achieving Associateship in 1941 and Fellowship (FRPS). He was awarded Honorary Fellowship in 1975. He was also a leading researcher who specialised on the chemistry of perfumes, cosmetics and soaps. Regional books The Snowdon Ranger Path (foreground) crosses a boggy area before ascending past Llyn Ffynnon-y-gwas. Scrambling on Crib Goch, Snowdonia, Wales Pennine Way near Black Hill summit Sharp Edge on Blencathra in the Lake District Poucher first started writing during the Second World War with large format (quarto) well illustrated volumes on various regions in Britain, such as *Lakeland through the Lens (Chapman & Hall, 1940) *Snowdonia through the Lens (Chapman & Hall, 1941) *Lakeland Holiday (Chapman & Hall, 1942) *Snowdon Holiday (Chapman & Hall, 1943) *Scotland through the Lens: Loch Tulla to Lochaber (Chapman & Hall, 1943) *Escape to the Hills (Country Life, 1943) *Highland Holiday: Arran to Ben Cruachan (Chapman & Hall, 1945) *The Backbone of England (Country Life, 1946) *Peak Panorama: Kinder Scout to Dovedale (Chapman & Hall, 1946) *A Camera in the Cairngorms (Chapman & Hall, 1947) *Over Lakeland Fells (Chapman & Hall, 1948) *The Surrey Hills (Chapman & Hall, 1949) *Wanderings in Wales (Country Life, 1949) *The Magic of Skye (Chapman & Hall, 1949) *Watch it, Sailor!

The books followed those of the Abraham Brothers in being exhaustively illustrated with the author's own photographs (usually in black and white). His habit in later volumes of drawing the route of ascent in white on the photograph was helpful for route-finding. Landmarks are important for route-finding, especially where paths are indistinct (as on many Scottish hills), and he advises on important features to look for on the paths he describes. They include cairns, standing stones, bothies, distinctive rock formations, panoramas, views and natural features such as cascades and waterfalls. He also warns of problems to be aware of on more challenging paths (such as the \\"bad step\\" on the climb up to Crib Goch). He generally used a Leica for his photography, and gave details of his methods in the pocket guides, together with friendly advice on hillwalking and scrambling. Each guide includes a list of the principal peaks and details of towns and villages useful for supplies, and closest points of access to the routes. Important national footpaths such as the Pennine Way are mentioned. He includes advice on essential equipment such as clothing including anorak or cagoule, compass, aneroid barometer, map, rucksack and climbing boots (the most important item), and when necessary, ice axe. Tweed is preferable to corduroy or cotton, and he personally prefers plus fours. Woollen clothing, especially pullovers or sweaters are also useful, and external clothing should be coloured red for visibility. He mentions hobnailed boots in one volume (The Lakes), but they are no longer available, having been displaced by the lighter vibrams with serrated rubber soles. To conserve heat, he recommends either a Bob-cap or balaclava, while a string vest is advisable to prevent heat loss in the cold. Essential foods included sweets for energy and water to prevent dehydration. He describes the skills needed, such as map reading, prevention of accidents and precautions to counter hypothermia. The problems of inclement weather in the hills are discussed and advice given on weather forecasting as well as anticipating hazardous conditions, especially fog and mist, but also rain and snow. A whistle is an essential when seeking help, while a torch is vital should darkness fall when on the path. His guides include relevant maps and the photographs of key parts of the routes he describes. Some natural phenomena encountered in the hills, such as the Brocken spectre and glory are briefly mentioned. Poucher's guides include: :The Welsh Peaks (1962) :The Scottish Peaks (1965) :The Lakeland Peaks (1960) :The Peak and Pennines (1966) :The Magic of Skye (1949, new edition 1980) Routes The rocky crest of Stac Pollaidh The Brecon Beacons in winter In all these books, he provides routes up the major peaks, and many minor ones as well, not being totally obsessed with peak bagging, but rather the interest and enjoyment of a particular route. So the route on Stac Pollaidh in Wester Ross is described in detail, despite being only about 2000 feet in height, for example. The crest of the ridge presents many interesting scrambling diversions, including at least one bad step before the final peak. A bad step is an awkward point in a scramble where hand support is needed. Bad steps are also usually exposed to steep drops below, so need a good head for heights. However, the routes described are necessarily limited to well-known paths, such as the Pyg track on Snowdon or the traverse of Kinder Scout in the Peak District, and walkers can vary their routes according to choice or need. The limited scope of his guides is clear from the Wales volume, which has few routes in the Brecon Beacons or Black Mountains for example. The routes in that volume are concentrated in Snowdonia and North Wales, where rock exposure is much greater than in the south or central areas of the country. Notable omissions include the Berwyns or Clwydian hills however, both ranges of mountains to the east of Snowdonia, which have many interesting routes to their summits. Likewise there are no paths described in Shropshire such as the Stiperstones, The Wrekin, Caer Caradoc or the Long Mynd. The Welsh borders is not considered at all. There are no routes described for the Cheviots, a hilly region in the Scottish Borders and Northumberland. And all coastland paths, many of which are exposed and rocky, are omitted from the guides, . Such routes and other in less mountainous regions are described however, in the many guides to the National Trails in Britain, such as that to the Pennine Way published by HMSO and written by Tom Stephenson. Later volumes of these works, updated in consultation with his son, John, remain in print as paperbacks by Frances Lincoln Publishers (who also publish the many Lakeland walking guides by Alfred Wainwright) . On the basis of the success of these guides, Poucher encouraged his publishers (Constable) to publish selections of rock-climbs in each area, in a similar photographic format. Tourist guides Poucher went on to create a series of coffee table books using high-quality colour photography. They included travel guides to the West Country, Scotland, Ireland and Wales. Perfumery Poucher was a research chemist by profession, working on the chemistry of perfumes. His 1923 textbook Perfumes, Cosmetics and Soaps has been revised and reprinted over the years and is now in its 10th edition. He was frequently given leave of absence by Yardley for part of the year to pursue his mountain photography. His profession caused some amusement in climbing circles, where he was occasionally described as \\"a perfume salesman who wears his wares\\".Janet Street-Porter, \\"The unsung hero of the Yardley soap opera\\", The Independent, 30 April 2000. Poucher appeared as a guest on Russell Harty's BBC chat show in November 1980 wearing makeup, perfume and ladies' gloves. This was incidentally the same edition of Harty's show that included Grace Jones' infamous physical attack on the host. Poucher was the guest to whom Harty was talking when he appeared to keep turning his back to her.http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01dwgwn Retrieved 28 July 2017 In May 2012 Poucher was the subject of a BBC Radio 4 programme The Perfumed Mountaineer presented by geographer Hayden Lorimer.

Plot Reno Davis is an American writer who has recently retired from boxing. Now unemployed and broke in France, he encounters the wealthy widow of a French general. Anne de Villemont is attracted to Reno, and he to her, but she keeps him at arm's length. She also hires him to tutor her eight-year-old son Paul. The real reason she wants Reno is for protection. Reno is led to believe that Anne's husband was killed in the Algerian conflict, and he is troubled by Anne's intense fear that Paul will be kidnapped. He then discovers the family has ties to a fascist organization that plans to take over all of Europe. He takes on the shady psychiatrist Morillon and mysterious family friend Leschenhaut, both of whom frighten Anne whenever they are around. Reno is framed for his best friend's murder as he and Anne become the targets of the ambitious and maniacal schemers who wish to rule Europe.

It is located on the northern banks of Wular Lake‚Äîthe second-largest freshwater lake in Asia. Bandipora has a terraced garden similar to that of Nishat Bagh in Srinagar. Bandipora is bound by mountains on three sides and by Wular Lake on the fourth. Bandipora is famous for three A's - A'lim (knowledge), Adab (good habits or literature) and Aab (water). As can be known from the folklore, the name of Bandipora originated either from Bund of Wular as Bund e pur, from the local folk- singing bands (bƒÅ·πád) as Baand e pur or from the enclosed (band) geographical location as Bandh e pur. Bandipora is bound by mountains on three sides and by Wular Lake in the fourth. Geography Bandipore is situated on the banks of the Wular, a large fresh-water lake which is home to a lot of migratory birds. Inadvertent dumping of the polluted river waters and sewage affluence has led to a pandemic growth of algae in the waters of the Wular which is threatening the lake and its supporting life itself. The main source of pollution to Wular is Jhelum River. The Jhelum River carries all the waste from Srinagar city and other surrounding areas and deposits it in Wular. Despite being the richest wetland of South Asia and the largest freshwater lake in Asia, no steps have been taken to save Wular. Bandipore is also a stepping town to the higher reaches of Razdan, Gurez and Tragbal. The famous Lolab Valley in Kupwara district is adjacent to the Bandipore. It is just from Bandipore via Aloosa village. Once this road is upgraded it will become a lifeline of the Lolab valley and it will provide an additional route to the Kupwara district. Bandipore was the connecting link between North India and Central Asia via the Silk Road. At Pazalpora village there was a custom and immigration department which is now a forest check-post. Due to the fact, Bandipore is also known as the gateway to Central Asia. There are strong links between Skardu, Gurez and Bandipore. Tehsils Bandipore is divided into seven tehsils * Bandipore * Sumbal Sonawari * Ajas * Hajin * Aloosa * Gurez * Tulail http://bandipore.gov.in/ Demographics Indian census, Bandipore had a population of 25,714.

Twelve per cent of the population is under 6 years of age. It has a Muslim majority though there are a few villages where Pandits also lived before they were ethnically cleansed from the region. The Pandit population were in large numbers at Ajar, Sonerwani, Kaloosa, Kharapora, Mantrigam, Aragam etc. Some Pandit families at Ajar and Kaloosa did not migrate. The temple at Kaloosa, known as Sharda Mandir, dates back to old times. It has a very big and old tree which is a few hundred years old and is a rare tree of its type. This is popularly known as Bran, a revered tree. There are many villages in this newly formed district named after Hindu gods and goddesses such as Chakreshipora, named after Chakerishwar. The forest training school of Kashmir is located in Bandipore. It was established in 1905. This institute is a premier body in the conservation process of the forest department. The majority of the population speak Kashmiri. Gojri and Pahari are also spoken. Tehsil Gurez is Shina- speaking and has a Shina majority. There are few Pashtun villages on the Line of Control. The Kishan Ganga Hydro Electric Project is also located in the Gurez Tehsil of Bandipore. Project is worth Rs. 2700 Crore (Rs. 27 billion).

M. Cornish. It tells the story of Rossam√ºnd, a boy unfortunately christened with a girl's name, who has lived his entire life in a foundlingery (kind of an orphanage) before he is chosen to become a lamplighter in a far away city. The book's action takes place entirely on the Half-Continent, a Dickensian world run by arcane science and alchemy, and plagued with deadly (and not-so-deadly) monsters. The books are notable for the extraordinary amount of constructed language which pervades the entire narrative; an extensive glossary of terms is provided, as an in-universe document \\"The Explicarium\\". Book One: Foundling Book Two: Lamplighter Lamplighter, the second book in the series, was due for release in May 2007 but was delayed to late April 2008.MonsterBlood Tattoo blog On 16 October 2007, D.M. Cornish announced on his blogsite that the Australian and New Zealand version of Lamplighter had just gone to the printers. It was later shortlisted for the 2008 Aurealis Award Best Young Adult Novel.Aurealis Awards The book covers Rosamund's final weeks as a prentice-lighter, the internal politics of the Lamplighters, his first posting, court-martial and leaving the service. Book Three: Factotum The third book is titled Factotum, it was published in October 2010. (Hard Cover) Available now in Australia, the United States and New Zealand. Setting The Half-Continent is the book's setting, a huge expanse of land bordered by ocean on its south and east sides. The continent, despite being thousands of miles across, is just one part of a larger world named Harthe Alle. The map of the Half-Continent labels other lands across the ocean. The events of the book take place in only a (relatively) tiny section of the Half-Continent, and it is a testament to Cornish's worldbuilding, as well as the substantial appendices at the end of each book, that many other places are named or alluded to within the story. The world of the Half-Continent is based around 18-19th century European culture, bearing some Gormenghastian traits as well as German influences. Much of the terminology and the names of the bickering city-states that constitute the Empire are drawn from the Holy Roman Empire. The key difference is the presence of a fantastic element. While there is no mention of magic, many characters exhibit magic-like powers that are attributed to science and alchemy. Also, there is the obvious existence of monsters - some natural, which differ from animals only through having sentience, and some man-made which are much more twisted and otherworldly than the natural kind. Technology as we know it has been replaced in Cornish's world with a sort of blend of mechanical and biological machinery. For example, many boats and ships are driven not by oars or engines but by \\"gastrines\\", living, mindless organs and organisms grown into the ship itself, which produce the kinetic energy required for the ship's propulsion, and must be \\"fed\\" nutrients and kept alive. Other examples include \\"Leers\\", individuals whose sensory organs have been specially treated with various alchemical concoctions to allow them to sense monsters or when another person is lying.

It is a rural and hilly area with Kamirwah being one of the most spectacular hills. It is located about away from Qazigund of Anantnag district on NH 44 (former name NH 1A before renumbering of all national highways). However, the distance between Banihal and Qazigund is only 18 km by train on the new railway line which is much shorter than the road. The most common language spoken in the region is Kashmiri; Urdu Gujjari English being other familiar languages. Etymology \\"Banihal\\" means blizzard in the Kashmiri language. Another view regarding the origin of the name of the place is that the word 'Banihal' has actually been derived from two Kashmiri words viz 'bah' meaning twelve and 'nallhe' meaning a rivulet. Twelve rivulets signifying the various brooks flowing through the area and eventually joining the small local river called Nalla Bischlari. There is a yet another school of thought amongst the locals and some scholars in which the word Banihal is thought of as having a Persian origin. \\"Nihal\\" in Persian means greenery and hence Banihal would imply 'Eternally green'. In some older texts, it has also been referred to as 'Devgol' (The abode of mystical giants). Banihal Pass Banihal Pass At elevation, the Pir Panjal mountains connect Banihal with Qazigund on the other side of the mountains. The Pir Panjal mountain range separates the Kashmir valley in the Indian state Jammu and Kashmir from the outer Himalaya and plains to the south. After the closure of the Murree-Muzaffarabad-Srinagar road on the partition of India in 1947, Banihal pass was the only passage from Jammu to Srinagar after independence until 1956 when Jawahar Tunnel was bored through the Pir Panjal range. The pass is accessible only in summer and in winters also if there is no heavy snowfall. If there is heavy snowfall during winters the roads are closed for few days until the snow is cleared from the highway. Banihal Road Tunnels =Existing road tunnel= A tunnel at elevation of through Pir Panjal mountain under the Banihal pass connects Banihal with Qazigund on the other side of the mountain. The tunnel named Jawahar tunnel after the first Prime Minister of India was constructed in early 1950s and commissioned in December 1956 to ensure snow-free passage throughout the year. However, it remains closed for a few weeks in winter due to snow avalanches. It was designed for 150 vehicles per day in either direction but now used by more than 7,000 vehicles per day in both directions. Therefore, a new wider and longer tunnel has been planned at a lower elevation. Jawahar tunnel is maintained by Border Road Organisation (BRO) of the Indian army and guarded 24x7 by the CRPF (Central Reserve Police Force), which also monitors it by CCTVs as the tunnel is vital for the Kashmir valley. The tunnel used to be closed to civilian traffic from midnight to 08:00 until 2009. Now it is open 24 hours a day. =New double road tunnel= Construction of a new Banihal Qazigund Road Tunnel started in 2011 to widen NH 44 (former name NH 1A before renumbering of all national highways) to four lanes. It is a double tube tunnel consisting of two parallel tunnels ‚Äì one for each direction of travel. Each tunnel is 7 metres wide and has two lanes of road. The two tunnels are interconnected by a passage every 500 metres for maintenance and emergency evacuation. The tunnel will have forced ventilation for extracting smoke and stale air and infusing fresh air. It will have state of the art monitoring and control systems for security. The new tunnel's average elevation at 1,790 m is 400 m lower than the existing Jawahar tunnel's elevation and would reduce the road distance between Banihal and Qazigund by 30 km. The new tunnel would also be less prone to snow avalanche as it will be at a lower elevation. The vehicles will have to pay toll tax to use the tunnel. The Southern portal (end) of the tunnel is at and the Northern portal (end) of the tunnel is at . Boring of the entire 8.5 km tunnel was completed on 20 May 2018 and the tunnel may open in 2019. Banihal Rail Tunnel A new 11.215 km (7 mile) long Banihal-Qazigund tunnel (also known as Pir Panjal railway tunnel) for the Jammu‚ÄìBaramulla line connecting Bichleri Valley of Banihal with Qazigund area of Kashmir Valley has been constructed. The tunnel is 8.40 m wide with a height of 7.39 m. There is a road along the length of the tunnel for the maintenance of railway tracks and emergency relief. The boring was completed in October 2011, its lining and laying of rail tracks was completed in the next one year and trial run commenced at the end of 2012. Commercial runs started from 27 June 2013 reducing the distance between Quazigund and Banihal by 17 km (from 35 km by road to 17.5 km by train). The tunnel's average elevation at is below the existing road tunnel. The rail tunnel will facilitate transportation during winters when inclement weather forces closure of the road tunnel and Srinagar-Jammu highway. Pir Panjal Railway Tunnel is India's longest and Asia's third longest railway tunnel (28 km long Taihang Tunnel in China is the longest and 21 km long Wushaoling Tunnel in Gansu, China is the second longest). The north portal of the Banihal railway tunnel is at and the south portal is at . Banihal railway station Banihal railway station (2014) Banihal railway station is situated at above mean sea level. It was commissioned on 26 June 2013 and passenger trains run from Banihal to Qazigund. The railway network in Kashmir from Banihal to Baramulla is now 137 km. Five trains run daily from Banihal to Baramulla. Until the 148 km Katra- Banihal section of Jammu‚ÄìBaramulla line gets constructed, expected to be completed by 2018, people can travel from Jammu Tawi or Udhampur to Banihal by road and take the train from Banihal to Srinagar.

Historical references According to the Rajatarangini (C-1000-1011 AD) ‚Äì a chronicle that recorded the history of Kashmir and its Kingdoms and Kings, Banihal was known as ‚ÄòVishalta‚Äô in the 11th Century and was a very narrow mountain valley which was used as an escape route by revolting Princes, rebel Chieftains, and even conspirators from Kashmir. In the 11th Century, a small fort called ‚ÄòBansalla‚Äô also existed below the old Banihal Pass. The Bansalla Fort belonged to the 11th Century ruler of Vishalta the Khasa Lord Bhagika who was the son-in-law of the Lord of Buddha Tikka. Pandit Sahib Ram, who in his book ‚ÄúTirthas‚Äù copies Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak's notes, metamorphosizes the Sanskrit name of village Banihal from Bhanusita or Bhanusata, i.e., rocks of the Sun or land of the Sun. Aurel Stein on his commentary on Kalhana's Rajatarangini describes the place differently. According to him, Visalata or Banihal must be identified with the valley drained by rivulet Bischlari.

Currently working in New York City, Nikki (Seunghee) Lee, works professionally in the field of photography and film. Her work is informed as an 'Asian notions of identity, where identity is not a static set of traits belonging to an individual, but something constantly changing and defined through relationships with other people.'  Early life  During her childhood, Lee was exposed to a variety of foreign cultures through the media. She developed an interest in learning about various cultures and its people; however, because of the social belief of the time that it is impossible for a female artist to gain recognition, she was hesitant to pursue a career in art. Lee pursued an acting career instead but left due to insecurities of her physical appearance. At age 23, Lee attended Chung-Ang University to gain a degree in photography. Education Lee earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in photography at Chung-Ang University in South Korea in 1993. After a year, she moved to New York City to attend the Fashion Institute of Technology to study commercial photography. Then she earned her Master of Arts in photography at New York University (NYU) in 1998. At NYU, she found her interest in the conceptual aspect of photography. Until her study in New York University, she mainly worked on documentary projects, which made her to go out to the streets and take photographs; she disliked this aspect of documentary because she did not like 'bothering people.' Her time at NYU was an influential force that encouraged her to become re-engaged with art and the art world. While at NYU, she encountered a friend who took her to art galleries and introduced her a wide range of books. Like this, the personal relationships she formed at school led her to later pursue her career as an artist. Work In Lee's early career, she started as a photo assistant for the LaChapelle Studio. She carried lighting, helped set up the studio, and loaded film as an intern. Although she enjoyed working for commercial photography, she suddenly wanted to 'make something on her own', which propelled her to enter a new career as a photographer. =Projects, 1997‚Äì2001= Lee's most noted work, Projects (1997‚Äì2001), began as a graduation requirement. Photographs were of herself with many groups of people such as drag queens, punks, swing dancers, senior citizens, Latinos, hip-hop musicians and fans, skateboarders, lesbians, young urban professionals, and schoolgirls. With a simple point-and-shoot camera, she asked others to record her.Miller, J. Macneill (September 2007), \\"The Impersonal Album: Chronicling Life in the Digital Age.\\", Afterimage, 35 (2): 9‚Äì12 She immersed herself into each American subculture and created a new self-identity. Lee devised her work about investigating notions of identity and the uses of vernacular photography rather than creating beautiful pictures.\\"Fluid Identities: The \\"Parts\\" and \\"Projects\\" of Nikki Lee\\". Broad Strokes: The National Museum of Women in the Arts' Blog. 1 November 2013. Retrieved 2018-05-11. Lee would select a subculture, research it, and adopt the clothing, customs, and mannerisms of the group to fully integrate herself with the culture. She would try out many culturally diverse types of makeup, hairstyles, dyeing salon, multicolor contact lenses, and dance exercises. After three or more months of developing the identity, Lee would ask a person to take a picture of her with the group.Lee, Phil (January 2008), \\"\\"Indefinite \\"Nikkis\\" in a World of Hyperreality: An Interview with Nikki S. Lee.\\"\\", Chicago Art Journal, 18: 76‚Äì93 The use of the automatic camera provided Lee with a red timestamp, capturing that moment the person took a picture. While Lee's projects appear completely unique from one another, there is a common thread among all of the subcultures she portrays. One such is that each of the groups she chose to create an identity has a distinctive look that functions as a connection between the members of their community. Lee's projects highlight her underlying concept of how other people make her a certain kind of person and the influence of inner relationships on the idea of identity.University of Michigan (19 August 2009), Nikki S. Lee - Parts and Projects ‚Äì via YouTube Lee continues to question the concepts of identity and social behavior; she believes that 'essentially life itself is a performance. When we change our clothes to alter our appearance, the real action is the transformation of our way of expression- the outward expression of our psyche.' \\"Museum of Contemporary Photography\\". www.mocp.org. Retrieved 2019-04-26. Lee claims that when she shows her work, she prefers presenting a number of photographs together since they are all connected. The projects support and define one another. Lee's ultimate goal is for the audience to make up their own story when they see her work. To many, The Yuppie Project (1998) is the most significant of Lee's series. Lee immerses herself in the world of Wall Street professionals and whiteness as a race. The Yuppie Project highlights how white people rarely acknowledge the intricate subcultures of their own race by focusing on documenting a small minority of influential men in business settings. Whiteness is represented in two ways; one being the affluence of these young business men and the other being the exclusivity and alienation. In a couple of months of this project, Lee adopts the appearance, body language, and speech pattern of the subcultures to document them in her photographs. Unlike other projects of the series in which Lee is almost indistinguishable from her new clique, Lee stands out in the photographs of The Yuppy Project.\\"Photographer Nikki S. Lee Can Turn Into Anyone\\". Architect Magazine. Retrieved 28 December 2019. =2002‚Äìpresent= A more recent series by Lee, Parts (2002‚Äì2005), uses images of Lee posing in different settings with a male partner, cropped to make it impossible to directly see who she is with, leaving only a trace of the man, such as an arm or a foot. This picture sets the focus completely on Lee, which suggests that her identity also changes after each emotional relationship. Lee states that after each photo, her companions state that she looks different then what they thought. With this project, Lee demonstrates the development of an identity that grows and mutates based on the unknown identity of the companion. Parts portray how one of Lee's persona diverges on where she is, how she acts, and how her own identity conforms around the identity of her partner. In 2006, Lee released the film, A.K.A. Nikki S. Lee. The project, described as a \\"conceptual documentary\\", alternates segments presenting Lee as two distinct personalities, one a reserved academic and another an outgoing socialite. It had its premiere at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, October 5‚Äì7, 2006. The film appears to be a true Nikki documentary, a young woman who is serious about making a second documentary about herself. Nikki No. 2, an impulsive personality, flaunts in the photo. Lee explained in an interview, \\"Nikki number one should be Nikki, and Nikki number two should be fake. But both are Nikki fake.\\" Through this work, she aims to point out the interesting concept of showing reality and non-reality at the same time. During her career, Lee's only work for a commercial magazine was with Black Book. Lee collaborated with the magazine on the theme of Bourgeois which featured photographs of herself and her companion as a bourgeois couple.Waltener, Shane. \\"The Real Nikki.\\" Modern Painters 17, no. 1 (2004): 67-69. One of her most recent works is Layers (2008), which is a series of photographs that show layers of the portraits she collected from 14 different cities. Lee would requests street artists to draw her portrait in which she would layer them together underneath a lightbox and take a photo of the mix. The purpose of this project was to find out how people from different cities and ethnicity would view her and describe her features. With this project, Lee asserts that everyone has complex, multilayered personalities, in which any small parts can be viewed by others of different ethnicity.

Celtis laevigata is a medium-sized tree native to North America. Common names include sugarberry, Southern hackberry, or in the southern U.S. sugar hackberry or just hackberry. Sugarberry is easily confused with common hackberry (C. occidentalis) where the range overlaps. Sugarberry has narrower leaves which are smoother above. The species can also be distinguished by habitat: where the ranges overlap, common hackberry occurs primarily in upland areas, whereas sugarberry occurs mainly in bottomland areas. Sugarberry's range extends from the Eastern United States west to Texas and south to northeastern Mexico. It is also found on the island of Bermuda. Ecology Sugarberry occurs primarily along streams and in moist soils on floodplains. Its sweetish fruit is eaten by birds and rodents, helping to disperse the seeds. The leaves are eaten by a number of insects, for example caterpillars of the Io moth (Automeris io). Sugarberry's leaf litter contains allelopathic chemicals that inhibit seed germination and growth in many other plant species.M.A.K. Lodhi, E.L. Rice. 1971. Allelopathic effects of Celtis laevigata.

Small amounts are used for dimension stock, veneer, and containers, but the main use of sugarberry wood is for furniture. The light-colored wood can be given a light- to medium-brown finish that in other woods must be achieved by bleaching. The wood is also used to produce sporting goods and plywood.Florida Forest Trees: Sugarberry (Celtis laevigata) Sugarberry is frequently planted as a shade-tree within its range.

According to an inscription, the mosque is dated 698 AH (1298 AD). Tribeni (junction of three rivers viz, the Ganges, the Yamuna, and the Sarasvati - hence the name) was an ancient holy place of the Hindus. The Muslims conquered it during the early phase of their conquest of Bengal. The mosque is an oblong structure measuring externally. It is the earliest surviving example of the brick-and-stone style introduced by the Muslims in Bengal in place of the traditional Hindu style of laying rectangular cut stones one upon another without mortar. The stones used in the mosque were originally materials from temples, as evidenced by figures of Hindu deities carved on some pieces. The original structure has suffered reconstruction a number of times. There are five arched entrances in the east wall. The arches are supported by stumpy hexagonal stone piers. The mosque represents the multi-domed oblong type developed by the Muslims in Bengal in which the number of domes on the roof equals the number of entrances in the east wall multiplied by those on either sides. The north and south walls have two doors each. There are thus ten domes roofing the mosque. The interior of the structure is broken into two longitudinal aisles and five short bays by means of stone pillars, creating ten equal compartments. The brick-built domes rest on stone pillars and pointed arches with brick pendentives at the corners. Zafar Khan Ghazi Masjid, Tribeni The silhouette of the successive pointed arches has added to the spaciousness and grandeur of the mosque interior. Corresponding to the five entrances in the east, there are five mihrabs in the west wall contained within multifoil arches. The mihrab wall shows sparse decoration within panels. The cornice and the parapet of the structure are straight. The mosque follows the Bengali type with only the prayer chamber without court, riwaq and minaret. A significant feature of the mosque interior is that a brick wall up to the level of the arch-spring has closed the bay at each end, north and south, across the middle. These are the only parts of the mosque which show terracotta ornamentation. The southern part is in a fair state of preservation and shows a panelled composition. The central panel is broken into two halves vertically by means of rosettes within square frames - the lower depicting a swinging creeper with luxuriant leaf age and the upper two half-arch motifs with a finial in the thick of shrubs and foliage. The flanking panels are similarly disposed and ornamented. All the panels depict multifoil arches with finials. The vegetal motifs betray local influence and speak of the Muslim adaptive spirit. The ornamentation of the northern bay wall is in ruins, but surviving traces show its dissimilarity from the southern. The composition here shows two small vertical panels each containing a multifoil arch with a finial from which hangs a chain ending in a round pendant. What is significant about these bay walls is that they are completely incongruous with the mosque interior but their ornamentation resembles that in the Bagha mosque (1524) in Rajshahi district. The western chamber of Zafar Khan Ghazi Dargah, Tribeni Only yards away to the east of the mosque, beyond an open courtyard, stand two square rooms aligned east-west side by side, the western housing two graves - those of Zafar Khan Ghazi and his wife and the eastern showing four graves on a masonry platform. The walls are built of old temple materials - rectangular stone pieces - and the rooms are without a roof and open to the sky. They are entered through a central door in the north wall flanked on either side by a rectangular shallow niche with a trefoil arch above. The northern door of the western room is made up of a Hindu frame as shown by carved Hindu figures. The eastern room shows sculptured scenes from the ramayana and the mahabharata. There are other stone sculptures fixed at the plinth on the outer face. The structure neither conforms to a Hindu temple nor to a Muslim tomb. What is probable is that it was built on a makeshift plan with reshuffled temple materials. The unsettled nature of Muslim occupation of the region at the time supports such a suggestion.

However, the popularity of Kartik Puja (worshipping Kartik) is decreasing now, and Lord Kartik is primarily worshipped among those who intend to have a son. In Bengal, traditionally, many people drop images of Lord Kartik inside the boundaries of different households, who all are either newly married, or else, intend to get a son to carry on with their ancestry. Lord Kartik is also associated to the Babu Culture prevailed in historic Kolkata, and hence, many traditional old Bengali paintings still show Kartik dressed in traditional Bengali style. Also, in some parts of West Bengal, Kartik is traditionally worshipped by the ancestors of the past royal families too, as in the district of Malda. Kartik Puja is also popular among the prostitutes. This can probably be linked to the fact that the prostitutes mostly got clients from the upper-class babu-s in old Kolkata, who all, in turn, had been associated to the image of Kartik (as discussed above). In Bansberia (Hooghly district), Kartik Puja festival is celebrated like Durga puja of Kolkata, Jagadhatri puja in Chandannagar for consecutive four days. The festival starts on 17 November every year or on 16 November in case of a leap year. Some of the must-see Puja committees are Bansberia Kundugoli Nataraj, Khamarapara Milan Samity RadhaKrishna, Kishor Bahini, Mitali Sangha, Yuva Sangha, Bansberia Pratap Sangha and many more.

Voltio is now retired. His nickname came to be as the result of an accident. Before joining Karel, he worked as an electrician. One day, he stuck his hand in the wrong place and got shocked. Everyone then called him \\"Bombillo\\" (Light Bulb) and \\"Corto Circuito\\" (Short Circuit), until eventually giving him a nickname that stuck: \\"Voltio\\" (Spanish word for volt). Julio Voltio now identifies as a born-again Christian. Julio said in an interview: \\"Yes, really I accepted Christ as my savior, I really do because sometimes you have a void in the hearts and one therefore needs.\\"  Music career  Growing up in the Parque Ecuestre section of Carolina, Voltio entered the music business as a teenager. Together with Rey 29 and H√©ctor Delgado (AKA Hector \\"El Father\\"), he formed The Masters of Funk. Although the trio released no listed albums, they were influential in starting the reggaeton movement. Shortly after separating from The Masters of Funk, Voltio partnered with Karel, a neighborhood friend, to form Karel y Voltio. They released their debut album Los Due√±os del Estilo in 2003. The album languished, however, and the duo's enthusiasm dwindled. Karel was last featured in La Mision 4. Voltio was signed under Pina Records company. Pina stole money from Voltio and he left that company, then went into a musical battle (Tiraera Pina, Bling Bling, Wasa Wasa) against Lito y Polaco, Pina Records main artists. With few options, Voltio was preparing to exit the music business when Tego Calder√≥n, a leading artist with White Lion Records, convinced him to sign with the label. Having taken Tego's advice, Voltio released the album Voltage AC, with the hits \\"Bumper\\", \\"No Amarres Fuego\\" (featuring Zion & Lennox) and \\"Julito Mara√±a\\". Voltio also featured on a remix of the song \\"Locked Up\\" by Akon, which was released in the UK as part of Locked Up-Global Remixes.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJZv-PQlGjs Having experienced relative success, Voltio returned with his a self-titled release in 2005, which included his biggest hit to date \\"Chul√≠n Cul√≠n Chunflai\\", which features Residente Calle 13 and a remix version with Three 6 Mafia. In 2006, Voltio was on Frankie 2006 remix of his \\"Puerto Rico\\". Voltio recently teamed up with Calle 13 to speak out against police brutality in Puerto Rico. On August 11, 2008, announced the publication of a documentary titled \\"En vivo desde Oso Blanco\\". The production covers the time that Voltio spent in prison. Voltio is also included on the Grand Theft Auto IV soundtrack with his song P√≥nmela from the 2007 release of En lo Claro. He made collaborations with Jowell & Randy (Welcome to my crib). En lo Claro has experienced mild success in contrast to Voltio's first two releases, garnering #36 on the U.S. Billboard Top Latin Albums chart. The album also peaked at #24 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart. In 2014, Voltio left reggaeton and converted to Christianity.

The various species were large, displaying a suit of semiaquatic adaptations similar to those of the modern hippopotamus despite their closer affinities with rhinoceroses. Taxonomy Restoration by Charles R. Knight Metamynodon is a member of the extinct family Amynodontidae, sometimes called \\"swamp rhinos\\" as they were once all believed to be semi- aquatic. It is split into two tribes: the semi-aquatic Metamynodontini‚ÄìParamynodon, Sellamynodon, Megalamynodon, and Metamynodon‚Äìand the tapir-like Cadurcodontini‚ÄìProcadurcodon, Zaisanamynodon, Cadurcodon, and Cadurcotherium. The Metamynodontini are found across the world, with Paramynodon from Myanmar, Sellamynodon from Romania, and Megalamynodon and Metamynodon from North America. Megalamynodon is likely the ancestor of Metamynodon, though it is possible it could have evolved from an Asiatic ancestor. Metamynodon was first described in 1887 by William Berryman Scott and Henry Fairfield Osborn based on a skull of M. planifrons found in the White River Formation. In 1922, paleontologist Clive Forster-Cooper initially described tooth remains from Balochistan, Pakistan as M. bugtienses before returning 2 years later and reassigning it to the genus Paraceratherium. Metamynodon bones are common in Early Oligocene riverbed deposits of Badlands National Park in South Dakota, giving them the nickname \\"the Metamynodon channels.\\" In 1981, a large jawbone, 41723-5, from Brewster County, Texas was described as M. mckinneyi, named after one of the discoverers Billy Pat McKinney, and was found in an area dated to 43 mya in the Late Eocene. The jawbone and tusks were more massive than that of M. chadronensis, and it could represent either a transitional phase between Amynodon and M. chadronensis, or simply a migrant to the area. Description Restoration by Heinrich Harder Metamynodon planifrons, the largest species, was about in length and in weight, and, although it was distantly related to modern rhinos, looked more like a hippo (Hippopotamus amphibius). Its front legs had four toes instead of the three found in modern rhinos. Like other swamp rhinos, Metamynodon has large canines, and Metamynodonts generally have larger canines than other swamp rhinos. The shortened snout and large nostrils indicate Metamynodon had a prehensile lip. Metamynodonts were more brachycephalic and had a broader than longer snout. The nostrils would have been on the top portion of the snout like the modern hippo. As other aquatic mammals, Metamynodon had a poorer sense of smell than other swamp rhinos. The eyes were located high on the skull so it could see while also being completely submerged. It had a dental formula of . Like other aquatic mammals, Metamynodon had small neural spines projecting upwards from the thoracic vertebrae, indicating weak neck muscles, which probably was due to buoyancy and a lack of necessity to support the head while submerged. The ribcage was broad and Metamynodon had a barrel- like chest similar to the hippo, which could either be an adaptation to an expanding digestive tract or to develop muscles necessary to prevent rolling over in the water. Like other aquatic mammals, the leg muscles‚Äìpopliteus in the knee; gastrocnemius, soleus, and peroneus tertius in the calf; and extensor digitorum longus in the foot‚Äìwere all large and well-developed, probably to exert more force while walking and to better wade through muddy soil. Paleobiology Restoration of the Oligocene South Dakota Badlands Like other Metamynodonts, Metamynodon was semi-aquatic. Like the modern hippo, Metamynodon was likely a grazer, feeding on grass and tough plant material at night and residing in the water during the day. Like hippos, males may have used their large tusks for fighting or for finding food in river banks. They went extinct in the Late Oligocene. The Early Oligocene Badlands National Park were probably streams coursing through grasslands, gallery woodlands, and savannas. Metamynodon was probably abundant and restricted to the streams; common in the gallery woodlands were the horse Mesohippus and the pig-like Merycoidodon; and in the savannas the rabbit Palaeolagus, the deer-like Leptomeryx and Hypertragulus.

The move provided a more modern classroom standard, science laboratories and a playing field. Another house, Woodview House, was purchased in 1913.

H. Bennett Studio is a historic photographic studio and photography museum located in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States. The studio building was built in 1875 by noted landscape photographer H. H. Bennett. It was operated by his family until 1998, when the studio was donated to the Wisconsin Historical Society. Today the studio, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, serves as a historical museum.  History  H. H. Bennett began his career as a photographer in 1865, when he bought a portrait studio in Kilbourn City (now Wisconsin Dells) from local photographer Leroy Gates. Although there was little demand for portraits in the area, Bennett was able to achieve fame for a series of photographs he took of the nearby Dells of the Wisconsin River. As Bennett's pictures of local scenery became popular in cities across the nation, sightseers began to flock to Kilbourn City to view the Dells in person. Bennett capitalized on this by offering the tourists souvenir postcards and portraits, and was able to build a new red brick studio in 1875. This is the structure that still stands in Wisconsin Dells today. In addition to operating as a typical photographic studio, Bennett's studio functioned as a gift shop and information center for the surrounding area, selling souvenirs and crafts to visitors. Bennett's darkroom At the studio, Bennett devised a number of new technologies to advance his photography. Among the most notable of his creations was his revolving solar printing house. Printing photos in Bennett's time required light, and because electricity was not available, sunlight was needed for Bennett to print any pictures. However, in order to ensure that he had sufficient sunlight throughout the day, Bennett needed a way to move his workspace while the sun moved in the sky. In order to achieve this, he constructed a small building with skylights, and mounted it upon rollers that rode a circular track outside his studio. Then, using a cable and pulley system, he was able to move the printing house around the track as often as needed to ensure optimum sunlight for printing. Bennett's unique creation is now housed in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.  Museum  Following H. H. Bennett's death in 1908, the operation of the photography studio passed to his children, and his descendants continued to own the studio until 1998, when it was donated to the Wisconsin Historical Society for use as a historic site.H. H. Bennett Studio, Studio Overview. Following its acquisition of the site, the historical society restored the studio building to its 1908 appearance. This project was completed in 2000, and the restored studio is now open to the public as the H. H. Bennett Studio & History Center. In addition to offering exhibits that recreate the interior workspace of the studio as it was used by Bennett, the museum gives visitors the opportunity to view Bennett's many stereoscopic images of the Wisconsin Dells in three dimensions using LCD shutter glasses. The site is also home to a replica of Bennett's revolving solar printing house. References External links *H. H. Bennett Studio & History Center * H. H. Bennett photographs *Wisconsin Stories: The H.

He likely studied with Palestrina, and was a skilled and prolific composer, especially of cyclic madrigals of the type popular in Rome. Life Mel was born in Mechelen to an aristocratic family closely connected to the Duchy of Lorraine; his father was in charge of the financial management of the Duke's estate. In 1562, at the probable age of eight, he began study at the Cathedral of St. Rombaut, with S√©verin Cornet being his principal teacher. In 1572, after finishing his schooling, he was sent to Lisbon by his family, where he may have served as maestro di cappella at the court (according to Giuseppe Baini, the 19th century writer on music, who was not always a reliable source). By 1580 he was in Rome, possibly studying with Palestrina. Records indicate he was at Chieti in 1583, and in January 1584 in Venice; in July of that year he accepted a position as maestro di cappella at Rieti Cathedral, but was dismissed shortly thereafter for being too often absent from his duties. Between 1585 and 1591 Mel traveled widely, returning to Flanders, including Li√®ge and Antwerp. He served briefly as maestro di cappella for the Duke of Bavaria, then in Li√®ge, for at least a few months beginning in July 1587. He visited Venice, Rome, Magliano Capo di Sabina, and Aquila during the years 1585 to 1591 as well. Between 1591 and 1597 he was music director at the cathedral and seminary in Magliano Capo di Sabina. He disappears from the record after 1597, but a book of newly composed chansons by him, published in Antwerp that year, has suggested that he may have again returned to the land of his birth. Music All of Rinaldo del Mel's surviving music is vocal, and it is both sacred and secular. He was a prolific composer, and wrote both motets and madrigals, as well as some forms that blended elements of the sacred and secular, such as a collection of \\"spiritual canzonets\\". His style shows the craftsmanship of an exceptional Netherlandish musical training, as well as the influence of Palestrina, who was probably his teacher, as claimed by Baini. Mel's sacred music, as would be expected of a composer of the Roman School, is more conservative stylistically than his secular music. Since his music is yet to appear in a modern edition it has not been fully evaluated by scholars. Mel wrote several sets of cyclic madrigals, i.e. sets of madrigals which set successive stanzas of a long poem (Monteverdi's Sestina: Lagrime d'Amante al Sepolcro dell'Amata is probably the most famous example of a cyclic madrigal set). Setting cyclic madrigals was a hallmark of Roman School composers. Mel's settings show some progressive tendencies, such as an increasing melodic emphasis on the uppermost part, a feature which foreshadowed the polarization of soprano and bass parts that was a feature of the Baroque style several decades later. In addition, in his secular music he often employs harmonic progressions with root motions in fifths, another feature of the Baroque style to follow. Another stylistic aspect of his madrigals is the prominent use of textural contrast, with chordal, syllabic passages alternating with passages in running thirds or sixths, or brief imitative sections. Long sections of purely contrapuntal writing are absent from his secular music, although, as in Palestrina, smooth counterpoint is the primary textural language of his sacred music.

Carol Publishing Group from Newport Rhode Island to Bermuda. During the journey, Lennon's yacht encountered a prolonged and severe storm, resulting in most of the crew eventually succumbing to profound fatigue and seasickness. Lennon (free of seasickness) was eventually forced to take the yacht's wheel alone for many hours. Lennon found this terrifying but invigorating, with the effect of both renewing his confidence and making him contemplate the fragility of life (Lennon claimed his recovery from heroin addiction some years earlier had rendered him immune to seasickness). Once he arrived in Bermuda, Lennon heard the line 'living on borrowed time' from Bunny Wailer's \\"Hallelujah Time\\" and was inspired by his recent experience to write the lyrics around that theme. Wailer was also the inspiration for the reggae feel of the music. Lennon commented that living on borrowed time was exactly what he was doing but then said, \\"come to think of it, it's what we're all doing, even though most of us don't like to face it.\\" (Seaman, 1991, p159). Recording A demo of the song with acoustic guitar and double-tracked vocals was recorded in Bermuda on 22 June 1980 and was released on the John Lennon Anthology in 1998. An attempt was made to formally record the song during the Double Fantasy sessions on 6 August 1980. It was the second song attempted during the sessions, with Lennon telling the band to think of the Isley Brother's \\"Twist and Shout\\" and \\"Spanish Twist\\". As he was somewhat frustrated that the band could not quite catch the reggae feel, Lennon decided to set the song aside. A horn overdub was planned, but never recorded.

See text for nomenclature history Daeodon is an extinct genus of entelodont artiodactyl that inhabited North America between 29 and 19 million years ago during the middle Oligocene and early Miocene epochs. It had a broad distribution across the United States, but it was never abundant. The type species is Daeodon shoshonensis, the last and possible largest of the entelodonts; known adults of this species possessed skulls about in length. Another huge member of this family, similar in size and morphology to Daeodon, is the Asian Paraentelodon but it is known by very incomplete material.  Etymology  Although not specified in Cope's original description, the name Daeodon comes from the Greek words , meaning \\"hostile\\" or \\"dreadful\\" and , meaning \\"teeth\\".  Classification  The genus Daeodon was erected by the American anatomist and paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in 1878. He classified it as a perissodactyl and thought that it was closely related to Menodus. This classification persisted until the description of \\"Elotherium\\" calkinsi in 1905, a very similar and much more complete animal from the same rocks, which was promptly assigned as a species of Daeodon by Peterson (1909). This led to Daeodons reclassification as a member of the family Entelodontidae. The exact relationships between Daeodon and other entelodonts are not well understood, some authors (Lucas et al., 1998) consider the greater morphological similarity of Daeodon to Paraentelodon rather than to earlier North American entelodonts, like Archaeotherium, as evidence for Daeodon being a descendant from a Late Oligocene immigration of large Asian entelodonts to North America. However, the existence of distinct specimens of Archoetherium showing characters reminiscent of those present in both Paraentelodon and Daeodon raises the possibility of both genera actually descending from a North American common ancestor. = Species = The type species of Daeodon is D. shohonensis, which is based on a fragment of a lower jaw from the John Day Formation of Oregon. Several other species were assigned to the genus in the subsequent decades, like D. calkinsi, D. mento and D. minor. Since 1945, it had been suggested that two other taxa were actually junior synonyms of Daeodon, but the formalization of this referral didn't take place until the work of Lucas et al. (1998). Ammodon leidyanum, named by Cope's rival, O. C. Marsh, and Dinohyus hollandi, a complete skeleton from the Agate Springs quarry of Nebraska, were found to be indistinguishable from each other and in turn both were indistinguishable from D. shoshonensis. With the exception of D. calkinsi, which was tentatively excluded from Daeodon, the other previously recognized species of Daeodon were also synonymized to D. shoshonensis. That same year, an obscure entelodont, Boochoerus humerosum, was also synonymized to Daeodon by Foss and Fremd (1998) and, albeit its status as a distinct species was retained, they note that the differences could still be attributed to individual or population variation or sexual dimorphism.  Description  Skeletal restoration Daeodon shoshonensis is the largest-known entelodont; known adult individuals had skulls about long and were about tall at the shoulders. It's differentiated from other entelodonts by a suite of unique dental characters, the shape and relatively small size of the cheekbone flanges of its skull compared to those of Archaeotherium, the small size of its chin tubercle, as well as features of its carpus and tarsus and the fusion of the bones of the lower leg. Like other entelodonts, its limbs were long and slender with the bones of the foreleg fused together and with only two toes on each foot. It also had a relatively lightly constructed neck for the size of its head, whose weight was mostly supported by muscles and tendons attached to the tall spines of the thoracic vertebrae, similar to those of modern-day bison and white rhinoceros.

Barnala city serves as the headquarters of the Barnala district which was formed in 2006. Prior to formation of Barnala district, this city was located in Sangrur district. It is situated near Bathinda. History Sikh historian Giani has recorded the details of setting up of Barnala in the annals of Khalsa in this manner that in the year 1775 Baba Ala Singh after offering Bhadaur (set up by King Padhar Sain) to his brother Duna Singh came to Barnala region which was lying aloof at that time. Setting it up, he made it his capital and took under his control surrounding villages. It too appears that Anahadgarh may be existing before and must have been deserted following attacks of Dharvis. There are different opinions about the nomenclature of Barnala. Some are of the view, Vaaran being a region because of frequent storms was at that time also called Varna. So Barnala was called a land of too many storms which later on became Barnala because of precision of example. Another view reveals that a fort here is said to be built by Baba Ala Singh in which there was a ‚ÄòBaahuli‚Äô (a well which had stairs going down). That too due to precision and Malwai accent was known as ‚ÄòBaain‚Äô. Thus Baain Wala ultimately became Barnala. Thus these are different views only but no historical detail is available that how name Barnala came into existence. Barnala was named after Baba Ala Singh. Baba Ala Singh left Bhadaur with his elder brother (hometown of Patiala State) and settled at Barnala and conquered many areas with the help of his brothers the Bhadaur Sardars. Though it was a district headquarters in erstwhile princely state system, it was later merged in PEPSU (Patiala & East Punjab States Union) and degraded as sub divisional headquarters.

Brown, 366 U.S. 599 (1961), was a case decided by the United States Supreme Court. In a 6-3 decision, the Court held that a Pennsylvania law forbidding the sale of various retail products on Sunday was not an unconstitutional interference with religion as described in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Prior history Plaintiffs sought to have a 1959 Pennsylvania statute, 18 Purdon's Pa. Stat. Ann. 4699.10 (1960 Cum. Supp.) overturned as unconstitutional. A three judge panel rejected their petition. (See Abraham Braunfeld v. Thomas J. Gibbons and Victor H. Blanc, 184 F. Supp. 352 (E.D.Pa 1959)). The Court also based its opinion in part on two earlier rulings. * In Two Guys from Harrison-Allentown, Inc., v. McGinley, 366 U.S. 582 (1961), the Court had previously ruled that the same Pennsylvania statute was not unconstitutional, either as (i) a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution or (ii) an impermissible establishment of religion under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Therefore, the only remaining issue in Braunfeld was whether the Pennsylvania statute was an unconstitutional interference in the appellant's religion. * In McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420 (1961), the Court had previously held that a similar Maryland statute was constitutional. The case =Background= Abraham Braunfeld and the other appellants were Pennsylvania merchants. As Orthodox Jews, the appellants were unable to do business on Friday evening or Saturday. They objected to a Pennsylvania law forbidding them from doing business on Sunday, arguing that the law unfairly discriminated against them by effectively forcing them to remain closed for one more day than competing Christian merchants. =Plurality opinion= Chief Justice Warren wrote the plurality opinion, joined by Justices Black, Clark, and Whittaker. * Chief Justice Warren first rejected appellants' Establishment Clause and Equal Protection Clause arguments, ruling that the Court's earlier opinion in Two Guys from Harrison-Allentown, Inc., v. McGinley, 366 U.S. 582 (1961) had concluded that the statute at issue did not violate either of those provisions. Braunfeld, 366 U.S. at 600-01. * Chief Justice Warren then addressed appellants' remaining argument - that by requiring Orthodox Jewish merchants to remain closed for one day in addition to their religiously required day of rest, the statute unfairly burdened existing Orthodox Jews and made it more difficult for the religion to recruit more members, thereby violating the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Braunfeld, 366 U.S. at 601-02. Chief Justice Warren reasoned as follows: ** While originally enacted for religious purposes, the so-called \\"Sunday Closing Laws\\" had a legitimate state purpose in providing for the general welfare by establishing a day of rest. Braunfeld, 366 U.S. at 602-03, citing McGowan, 366 U.S. at 437-40. ** Although the Court had previously held that the Free Exercise Clause prevented the States from passing laws that forbade the exercise of religion or required citizens to \\"say or believe anything in conflict with [their] religious tenets,\\" states could in some cases regulate conduct, even if that regulation burdened citizens of a particular religion. Braunfeld, 366 U.S. at 603-05. ** In order to balance the interests at issue, the Court held that: ::# Where the \\"purpose or effect of a law is to impede the observance of one or all religions or is to discriminate invidiously between religions, that law is constitutionally invalid even though the burden may be characterized as being only indirect.\\" Braunfeld, 366 U.S. at 607. ::# However, where \\"the State regulates conduct by enacting a general law within its power, the purpose and effect of which is to advance the State's secular goals, the statute is valid despite its indirect burden on religious observance unless the State may accomplish its purpose by means which do not impose such a burden.\\" Braunfeld, 366 U.S. at 607. ** In the specific case before the Court, the plurality opinion held that the law in question had only an indirect effect, and that the Court could not conclude that there was any less burdensome means of achieving the State's goals. In particular, although appellants argued that a law exempting citizens who were required to rest on other days from the Sunday rest day would be a wiser choice, the Court concluded that there were valid reasons for which a state might choose a single day of rest. Braunfeld, 366 U.S. at 607-09. =Concurrence/dissent (Frankfurter)= Justice Frankfurter wrote a concurring opinion with which Justice Harlan joined as to most points. (Justice Frankfurter published that opinion as part of McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420 (1961), but declared his opinion applicable to Braunfeld and several other cases. McGowan, 366 U.S. at 459, fn). * First, Justice Frankfurter examined the history of the First Amendment and \\"Sunday Statutes\\" in detail, and concluded that the Sunday statutes had a long history and substantial non- religious purpose. McGowan, 366 U.S. at 460-511. * On that basis, Justice Frankfurter rejected most of the appellants' claims. McGowan, 366 U.S. at 511-42. * However, Justice Frankfurter, writing solely for himself and not for Justice Harlan, did dissent on one point. Based on the procedural history of Braunfeld, Justice Frankfurter argued that appellants' claim that the law was irrational and arbitrary should not have been dismissed for failure to state a claim, but should have been permitted to proceed to an evidentiary stage. McGowan, 366 U.S. at 542-43. =Concurrence/dissent (Brennan)= In his opinion, Justice Brennan concurred in the plurality opinion to the extent that it held that the Pennsylvania statute did not violate the Establishment Clause or the Equal Protection Clause, but dissented from the remainder of the opinion, arguing that the statute should be held unconstitutional under the Free Exercise Clause. Justice Brennan wrote in part: > [T]he issue in this case - and we do not understand either appellees or the > Court to contend otherwise - is whether a State may put an individual to a > choice between his business and his religion. The Court today holds that it > may. But I dissent, believing that such a law prohibits the free exercise of > religion. Two years later, Justice Brennan wrote a majority opinion, in Sherbert v. Verner, that largely tracked his dissent in this case. In the Sherbert case, the court struck down a law on Free Exercise grounds that prohibited a worker from collecting unemployment compensation who was terminated from her job because she would not work on Saturdays for religious reasons. =Dissent (Douglas)= Like Justice Frankfurter, Justice Douglas also published his Braunfeld dissent as part of the earlier McGowan decision, at 366 US 561-82. In that opinion, Justice Douglas argued that the \\"Sunday Laws\\" could not be separated from their religious roots, and that the imposition of those laws on persons of other religions violated both the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution =Dissent (Stewart)= Justice Stewart joined Justice Brennan's dissent, and wrote further: > Pennsylvania has passed a law which compels an Orthodox Jew to choose > between his religious faith and his economic survival. That is a cruel > choice. It is a choice which I think no State can constitutionally demand. > For me this is not something that can be swept under the rug and forgotten > in the interest of enforced Sunday togetherness. I think the impact of this > law upon these appellants grossly violates their constitutional right to the > free exercise of their religion. Braunfeld, 366 U.S. at 616.

Andrew Lang included it in The Red Fairy Book. Synopsis A great lord was so cruel to his peasants that they called him Burchard the Wolf. His wife was kind and generous, and would secretly do good for those whom her husband wronged. One day Burchard saw a peasant woman named Renelde. He told her if she came to the castle, he would make her the countess's lady-maid. She refused because she had to look after her grandmother, and was betrothed to a huntsman named Guilbert. He returned again, offering to make her a lady-in-waiting, and then to dismiss the countess and marry her. The last offer would not have moved her even if she had wanted to be the countess, because the countess had helped her when her grandmother was ill. Some time later, he saw her spinning flax, and asked what she was about. She told him she was making her wedding shift, as she was to be married, if he gave his leave. He told her that she must spin nettles instead, to make her shift and his shroud, because she would not marry until he was laid in his grave. Guilbert offered to kill the count. Renelde refused because it would be murder, and besides, the countess had been kind to her. Her grandmother suggested that she try spinning the nettles. She found she could make good thread of them, and when Burchard came by again, she showed him her shift. She began on the shroud, and Burchard felt ill that evening. He sent soldiers to throw her into the river, but she struggled to shore and went on spinning. When they tried to tie a stone to her neck, it untied itself, and she made to shore. The Count had himself carried to the cottage‚Äîhe was too ill to walk‚Äîand tried to shoot her, but the bullet rebounded harmlessly. He broke the spinning wheel, but it was repaired the next day. He had her tied and set guards, but the guards fell asleep and the bonds untied themselves. He had every nettle uprooted, but they instantly sprouted again, even in her cottage. Every day the Count grew worse, and the Countess found out why. She asked Renelde to stop, and she did. The count recovered but still refused Renelde permission to marry Guilbert. After a year, Guilbert left. Another year went by, and Burchard fell ill again, though Renelde had not started spinning again. He grew worse and worse and longed for death, but could not die. Then he realized that his shroud was not ready. He sent word to Renelde to prepare it. His pains grew less as she spun, wove, and sewed. When she took the last stitch he died. Soon after this, Guilbert returned. He still loved Renelde and married her.

They are a fundamental element in frame building. Etymology Stud is an ancient word related to similar words in Old English, Old Norse, Middle High German, and Old Teutonic generally meaning prop or support.\\"Stud\\". def. 1. Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) ¬© Oxford University Press 2009 Other historical words with similar meaning are quarter and scantling\\"Scantling\\" def. 3.a. Oxford English Dictionary (one sense meaning a smaller timber, not necessarily the same use). Stick is a colloquial term for both framing lumber (timber) and a \\"timber tree\\"Whitney, William Dwight, and Benjamin E. Smith. The Century dictionary and cyclopedia. New York: Century Co., 1901. Print. accessed 1/9/2014 (a tree trunk good for using as lumber (timber)); thus, the names \\"stick and platform\\", \\"stick and frame\\", \\"stick and box\\", or simply stick framing. The stud height usually determines the ceiling height, thus sayings like: \\"...These rooms were usually high in stud...\\" Purpose Studs form walls and may carry vertical structural loads or be non load-bearing, such as in partition walls, which only separate spaces. They hold in place the windows, doors, interior finish, exterior sheathing or siding, insulation and utilities and help give shape to a building. Studs run from sill plate to wall plate. In modern construction, studs are fastened to the plates in a way, such as using ties, to prevent the building from being lifted off the foundation by severe wind or earthquake. Properties Studs are usually slender, so more studs are needed than in post and beam framing. Sometimes studs are long, as in balloon framing, where the studs extend two stories and carry a ledger which carries joists. Balloon framing has been made illegal in new construction in many jurisdictions for fire safety reasons because the open wall cavities allow fire to quickly spread such as from a basement to an attic; the plates and platforms in platform framing providing an automatic fire stop inside the walls, and so are deemed much safer by fire safety officials. Being thinner and lighter, stick construction techniques are easier to cut and carry and is speedier than the timber framing. In the United States and Canada, studs are traditionally made of wood, usually 2√ó4 or 2√ó6 by name; however, these historical dimensions have been reduced but still carry the name of \\"two by four\\" and \\"two by six\\". Typical dimensions of today's \\"two by four\\" is dimensional lumber and typically placed from each other's center, but sometimes also at or . The wood needs to be dry when used, or problems may occur as the studs shrink and twist as they dry out. Steel studs are gaining popularity, especially for non load- bearing walls, and are required in some firewalls. Other terms Studs used to frame around window and door openings are given different names, including * king stud ‚àí stud to left or right of a window or door that is continuous from the bottom plate to the top plate * trimmer or jack ‚àí stud to the left or right of a window or door that runs from the bottom plate to the underside of a lintel or header * cripple stud ‚Äì a stud located either above or below a framed opening, that does not run the full height of the wall * post or column ‚àí a doubled or other integral multiple of a group of studs nailed side by side. Posts in walls are used at point loads such as long spans near a wide window or sliding door, etc. A building technique mostly associated with Lincolnshire, England, and parts of Scotland gets part of its name from the studs: mud and stud (stud and mud). This building method uses studs in a framework which is then totally covered with mud which resembles the building material cob.Keefe, Laurence. Earth building: methods and materials, repair and conservation. London: Taylor & Francis, 2005. 14. Print. Another traditional building method is called stud and plaster where the plaster walls are held by lath on the studs. Studs are also the namesake of a type of timber framing called close studding. Grades Based on the American West Coast Lumber Inspection Bureau (WCLIB) grading rules, there is only one grade of stud: STUD. A stud is graded for vertical application and its stress requirements and allowable visual defects reflect that application. A stud is most similar to a #2 grade, which is held to a higher standard during grading. The biggest difference between the two is the frequency, placement and size of knots and overall allowable wane.

Wilson Fuel brands itself as the largest \\"independent\\" home heating fuel and gasoline retailer in Atlantic Canada; this is usually in reference to the fact that the company is a medium-scale retailer, as opposed to its competitors which are refiners and large-scale retailers. History Wilson Fuel traces its history to a mercantile trade company founded in Truro during the early 19th century. It branched out into construction in Colchester County during the early 20th century and was involved in some of the reconstruction efforts in Dartmouth following the Halifax Explosion. It was also a general contractor for many of Nova Scotia's historic buildings from the late 19th century and early 20th century. The company gradually left the construction industry and began to supply coal to Truro's residential and commercial customers for heating from a coal yard alongside the Canadian National Railways main line at Pleasant Street. The company adopted its present name of Wilson Fuel Company Limited during the 1950s when fuel oil replaced coal. The company expanded its residential and commercial fuel oil distribution and wholesale business through the 1960s-first decade of the 21st century and branched out into the retail petroleum business during the 1990s. The company maintains its headquarters on the original retail coal yard in Truro. The retail petroleum subsidiary of Wilson Fuel owns and operates 78 service stations, with 66 operating under the Esso brand, and the remainder under the brand Wilsons Gas Stops. The company also distributes gasoline to 155 independent retail stations throughout Atlantic Canada. All company owned and operated stations have convenience stores and fast food outlets. The company's president is Ian Alexander Wilson. Its former vice-president, Dave Collins, is often quoted by Nova Scotian media discussing that province's petroleum pricing policies, particularly when prices increase.25pix Petroleum price regulation controversy The provinces of Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick regulate the retail prices of all petroleum products (gasoline, diesel, propane, home heating fuel). Prince Edward Island has been regulating its prices since the 1980s and Newfoundland since the 1990s, however Nova Scotia and New Brunswick only implemented price regulation in 2006 in response to public pressure over wild price fluctuations during the winter of 2005-2006. Wilson Fuel's subsidiary Wilsons Gas Stops has been consistently opposed to price regulation. Wilsons Gas Stops moved into the Prince Edward Island marketplace in early 2005 after purchasing several Esso stations from Imperial Oil; this coming after several years of studying how the long-established price regulation scheme was working in that province. In the days following Hurricane Katrina, wholesale international prices for petroleum increased dramatically, forcing Wilsons and other independent (i.e. non-refining) retailers to adjust their prices accordingly, except that this wasn't possible in the regulated retail market in Prince Edward Island. On September 1, Wilsons Gas Stops announced that it would stop supplying fuel to its company- owned stations and its independent retail customers since the company would be taking a severe financial loss if it were to do so. Wilsons Gas Stops has continued to voice concern at increased price regulation in Atlantic Canada in the months since the price fluctuations following Hurricane Katrina.

The anterior pituitary gland produces the pro-hormone POMC, which is then cleaved again to form adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and Œ≤-lipotropin (Œ≤-LPH).  Œ≤-Lipotropin  Œ≤-Lipotropin is a 90-amino acid polypeptide that is the carboxy-terminal fragment of POMC. It was initially reported to stimulate melanocytes to produce melanin. It was also reported to perform lipid-mobilizing functions such as lipolysis and steroidogenesis. However, no subsequent studies have been published that support these early findings and no receptor has been identified for Œ≤-lipotropin. Œ≤-Lipotropin can be cleaved into smaller peptides. In humans, Œ≥-lipotropin, Œ≤-MSH, and Œ≤-endorphin, are all possible fragments of Œ≤-lipotropin. Œ≤-Lipotropin is the predominant opioid of the anterior human and rat pituitary gland. It is found in essentially equimolar concentrations to that of corticotropin. Evidence shows that Œ≤-Lipotropin is metabolized into endorphins that can greatly affect mood and behavior and is thus regarded as a prohormone.  Œ≥-Lipotropin  Œ≥-lipotropin is the amino-terminal peptide fragment of Œ≤-lipotropin. In humans, it has 56 amino acids. Gamma lipotropin is identical to the first 56 amino acid sequences of Œ≤-lipotropin. It can be cleaved to Œ≤-melanocyte stimulating hormone.  Use in sport  Lipotropin has also, under its alternate name AOD-9604 (Anti-Obesity Drug-9604),Peptides Direct information page, accessed 26 August 2013 been connected with controversies in Australian Rules Football. Allegations have arisen around the use of the drug and its administration to players of the Essendon Football Club as a supplement, including weekly administration to players in the 2012 season. The matters are currently under investigation due to the relationship between Lipotropin and growth hormones, as noted by club medical staff.AFL Statement of Charges against James Hird and Essendon Football Club, accessed 26 August 2013  References   External links   Tumor markers ","title":"Lipotropin"},{"id":"5708629","text":"Begumganj is a town and a municipality in Raisen district in the state of Madhya Pradesh, India. and is located on the Bhopal - Sagar National Highway (NH-86 A) 120 km away from Bhopal.

Description  Restoration Platygonus were gregarious animals and, like modern peccaries, possibly traveled in herds. At least nine known species of Platygonus are known and ranged from southern Canada to Mexico and from California to Pennsylvania. Stratigraphically, they occur throughout the Pleistocene (Calabrian), and as early as the Blancan in the Gelasian of the Pliocene. The most recent credible date obtained for some species remains is about 11,000 BP. They probably appeared very similar to their closest living relative, the Chacoan peccary.  Taxonomy  Platygonus compressus skull in The Children‚Äôs Museum of Indianapolis Platygonus was named by John Lawrence LeConte in 1848 for fossils found in Pleistocene karst deposits in Illinois, which are now preserved in the Academy of National Sciences in Philadelphia. The following species of Platygonus have been described: * P. bicalcaratus (nomen dubium) * P. brachirostris * P. chapadmalensis * P. cinctus * P. compressus (type) * P. kraglievichi * P. marplatensis * P. narinoensis * P. oregonensis * P. pearcei * P. pollenae * P. scagliae * P. setiger * P. striatus * P. texanus * P. vetus  Morphology  Most Platygonus species were similar in size to modern peccaries especially giant peccary, at around in body length, and had long legs, allowing them to run well. They also had a pig-like snout and long tusks which were probably used to fend off predators. They had a complex digestive system, similar to that of a modern ruminant.

Set primarily in the March of Wales during A.D. 1199 and 1200, it features a young boy named Arthur de Caldicot who observes a secondary story in the \\"Seeing Stone\\", the early life of legendary King Arthur. Crossley-Holland and The Seeing Stone won the annual Guardian Prize and Tir na n-Og Award. The trilogy is a contemporary retelling of Arthurian legend, told by Arthur de Caldicot as a first-person narrative, where both the primary and secondary settings contribute to the retelling. Plot = Plot in the Real World = The story begins in the year 1199, just before the beginning of the Fourth Crusade. Young Arthur de Caldicot, thirteen years of age at the time, is the second son of a knight living in Caldicot manor in the \\"Middle Marches\\" of the March of Wales. Most of the first book deals with the stresses associated with medieval life. Most important to Arthur is the fact that he is Sir John's second son, and thus ineligible to inherit land. To have a life of his own, he must become a squire and then a knight, and create his own manor and farmland. One challenge to overcome is his inadequate \\"yard-skills\\", especially jousting and swordplay. He is left-handed, considered a dangerous oddity in those days, but he must joust and fence with his off-hand. Another challenge is that his father would make him a scribe for his skill reading and writing. The obstacles disappear when he learns on his fourteenth birthday that his \\"uncle\\" Sir William de Gortanore is really his father; he becomes heir to a large manor. Unfortunately, it seems that his mother's husband was murdered by Sir William, who was jealous of him. And the revelation terminates the betrothal of Arthur and Grace, Sir William's daughter; as Grace is Arthur's half-sister they cannot marry. The novel ends with Arthur accepted as squire to the Lord of the Middle Marches, Stephen de Holt. The Seeing Stone (2006 paperback) = Plot in the Seeing Stone = The wizard Merlin gives Arthur de Caldicot the \\"Seeing Stone\\" early in the story, along with the warning it will cease to work if anyone else shares in its knowledge. Through the stone Arthur observes the life of legendary King Arthur until his rise to power as King of Britain. It begins with the marriage of King Uther and Ygerna. They conceive a child, who is named Arthur and is taken by Merlin to a foster family. Years later, when King Uther dies, Arthur comes to be king. Many specific people look similar to or exactly like people in Arthur's life. The most notable resemblance is between Arthur and young King Arthur himself, which leads de Caldicot to suppose that Arthur in the stone is himself in the near future. This belief is only accentuated when he learns on his birthday that his parents are only foster parents, as for young King Arthur. Eventually it becomes clear that King Arthur inhabits a parallel universe, with events in both worlds reflecting each other. Awards Crossley-Holland won the annual Guardian Children's Fiction Prize, a once-in-a-lifetime book award judged by a panel of British children's writers, recognising the best children's book by an author who has not yet won it. Exceptionally the 2001 Prize covered new publications during 21 months 2000‚Äì2001 as the schedule was re-aligned with the preceding school year rather than calendar year. The Welsh Tir na n-Og Award recognised The Seeing Stone as the year's best English-language book for young people with \\"authentic Welsh background\\". The Seeing Stone was bronze runner up for the Smarties Prize in ages category 9‚Äì11 years and it made the 2000 Whitbread Awards children's book shortlist.

It is located on NH-709B on the banks of Eastern Yamuna Canal, about 30 km (18 miles) north of Saharanpur, 190 km (118 miles) from New Delhi, and 77 km (48 miles) from Haridwar. It has an average elevation of 345 m above sea level. It is famous for the production of fruits such as mangoes, guavas, moorhas (reed stools), brass bells, and wrought iron handicrafts. It is home to the Mata Shakumbari Devi Temple. History Archaeological excavations and surveys provided evidence of the existence of many ancient settlements in and around Behat. Based on the artifacts discovered during these excavations, human habitation in and around this area is traced back to 2000 BCE. It is conjectured that Behat was known as Brihat-vat during the reign of the Nanda Dynasty (circa 501 BCE). An Ashoka pillar excavated from Topari (KhiderabƒÅd), near Saharanpur, was taken to Delhi by Sultan Firoz Shah Tughluq, and still resides in Feroze Shah Kotla. Mayapur and Behat were well-known cities in the Mauryan Dynasty (circa 180 BCE). Behat was next to Mayapur in importance, because it was an important Buddhist centre.A Gazetteer of Saharanpur District District Volume XIV: Gazetteers of the United Provinces edited by H. R Neville Xuanzang traveled through Behat and had come across important Buddhist monasteries in Behat (circa 630 CE) while searching sacred Buddhist texts and scriptures. During the reign of Bahlul Khan Lodi (1451-1489), a Muslim colony was founded in Behat by Shah Abdullah, who was a descendant of Saint Sheikh Baha-ud-din Zakariya Suhrawardi. The western part of Behat along the Naugaon Rau is named Abdullah Mazra after him. Behat remained the headquarters of a Paragana during the time of Akbar and was known as Behat Kanjawar. Around 1710 CE, Behat was called Jagir. It was famous for cow slaughtering, and Pirzadas normally only treated Jagir Muslims well. Around this time, the Sikh Army of Banda Bahadur Singh attacked, plundered, and razed the area. In 1834, Captain Proby Thomas Cautley discovered a buried town 5.18 m (17 ft) below the surrounding country and 7.62 m (25 ft) under the preexisting site while supervising the redesign of the Eastern Yamuna Canal (then known as the Doab Canal). The township was from pre-Indo Scythian times according to archaeological evidence found there. Cautley also found a large number of Indo Scythian coins and other pieces of evidence about the existence of a large Buddhist settlement. After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, a police station was established in Behat. Towards the end of the 19th century, the town had a post office and an upper primary school. An annual fair organised by Pirzadas was held in honor of Shah Abdullah until the end of the 19th century, chiefly organized by the local Pirzadas who then fell into difficult times due to their extravagance. After India became independent in 1947, the government has neglected the area; as a result, Behat has made little progress in last 70 years.  Geography  *The city is located 30.1¬∞N and 77¬∞E, north of Saharanpur.

Economy Behat's economy has been focused on agriculture for the last 200 years. The Western Yamuna Canal irrigates most of the arable land in Behat and crops have been good dueto rich soils.

During the recitation of the required texts, Rabbi Karo had a mystical experience: The Shekhinah appeared as a maggid, praising the circle and telling them to move to the Land of Israel. When they stayed up again the second night of Shavuot, the Shekhinah was adamant about their moving to the land of Israel. The account was recorded by Alkabetz.Introduction to book, Magid Mesharim He settled in Safed in 1535.  Thought  His works written in Adrianople center on the holiness of the people Israel, the Land of Israel, and the specialness of the mitzvot. Alkabetz accepts the tradition that Esther was married to Mordechai before being taken to the king's palace and becoming queen, and even continued her relationship with Mordechai after taking up her royal post. The view of midrash articulated by Alkabetz and other members of the school of Joseph Taitatsak represents an extension of the view of the authority of the oral law and halachic midrash to aggadic midrash and thus leads to the sanctification and near canonization of aggadic expansions of biblical narrative Barry Walfish, Kosher Adultery?

The notation is named after Clifford Hugh Dowker and Morwen Thistlethwaite, who refined a notation originally due to Peter Guthrie Tait. Definition To generate the Dowker‚ÄìThistlethwaite notation, traverse the knot using an arbitrary starting point and direction. Label each of the n crossings with the numbers 1, ..., 2n in order of traversal (each crossing is visited and labelled twice), with the following modification: if the label is an even number and the strand followed crosses over at the crossing, then change the sign on the label to be a negative. When finished, each crossing will be labelled a pair of integers, one even and one odd. The Dowker‚ÄìThistlethwaite notation notation is the sequence of even integer labels associated with the labels 1, 3, ..., 2n ‚àí 1 in turn. Example For example, a knot diagram may have crossings labelled with the pairs (1, 6) (3, ‚àí12) (5, 2) (7, 8) (9, ‚àí4) and (11, ‚àí10). The Dowker‚ÄìThistlethwaite notation for this labelling is the sequence: 6 ‚àí12 2 8 ‚àí4 ‚àí10\\\\. Uniqueness and counting Dowker and Thistlethwaite have proved that the notation specifies prime knots uniquely, up to reflection. In the more general case, a knot can be recovered from a Dowker‚ÄìThistlethwaite sequence, but the recovered knot may differ from the original by either being a reflection or by having any connected sum component reflected in the line between its entry/exit points - the Dowker‚ÄìThistlethwaite notation is unchanged by these reflections. Knots tabulations typically consider only prime knots and disregard chirality, so this ambiguity does not affect the tabulation. The m√©nage problem, posed by Tait, concerns counting the number of different number sequences possible in this notation.

Upperside silvery light blue with a satiny sheen in certain lights. Forewing: the apical half of the costa narrowly and the terminal margin for varying widths fuscous black, bounded outwardly on the latter by an obscure anteciliary black line. Hindwing: the costa broadly, the termen somewhat more narrowly fuscous black as in the forewing, with the width of this dark edging similarly variable; in addition there is a very diffuse and ill-defined subterminal series of spots darker than the fuscous margin. Underside: brownish grey. Forewing: a spot in cell, a transverse lunule on the discocellulars, and a transverse anteriorly inwardly curved series of eight discal spots, black; the transverse lunule and each spot encircled with a narrow white edging; the posterior two spots of the discal series geminate (paired). Beyond these are a postdiscal and a subterminal series of short transverse dusky black spots followed by an anteciliary black line; the ground colour between the discal and postdiscal series and between the latter and the subterminal series of spots posteriorly paler than on the rest of the wing. Hindwing: a transverse, subbasal, slightly sinuate line of four spots, a short, slender, lunular line on the discocellulars, and a very strongly curved discal series of eight small spots, black; the lunule and each spot encircled with a narrow edging of white; the posterior two spots of the discal series geminate as on the forewing; beyond these as on the forewing there is a double line of dusky spots, only more lunular, with between them and between the discal and postdiscal series the ground colour in the same way followed by slightly paler; an anteciliary fine black line. Cilia of both forewings and hindwings whitey brown, darker anteriorly on the forewing. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen dark brown, shafts of the antennae ringed with white; in fresh specimens the thorax and abdomen with a little light blue pubescence; beneath: palpi, thorax and abdomen white. Female upperside: brownish black; the basal halves of the wings slightly suffused with light blue, anteciliary black lines on both forewings and hindwings, and on the latter wing an obscure subterminal series of spots as in the male. Underside, similar,only the ground colour darker, the markings larger and more clearly defined. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in the male, but with no blue pubescence on the thorax and abdomen on the upperside. =Dry-season brood= South Indian race laying eggs on Oxalis Male upperside: pale bluish grey with, in some specimens, a pinkish undertone. Forewing: as in the wet-season brood, but the black terminal edging much reduced in width in some specimens to a transverse, somewhat diffuse, very narrow band that borders the anteciliary black line on the inner side, in others to a much broader similar band that coalesces with the anteciliary black line and occupies about the outer sixth of the wing. This edging along the termen is sometimes even, sometimes it widens from a slender anteciliary at and above the tornus to a broad black patch at the apex of the wing. Mating in Osaka, Japan Hindwing: the terminal black edging much narrower proportionately than in wet-season specimens, most often reduced to a slender black anteciliary line with a series of black spots on the inner side, bordering and sometimes coalescing with the line. Underside: as in the wet- season brood but the ground colour paler, in some specimens much paler, the markings on both forewings and hindwings similar, with frequently the terminal markings obsolescent, sometimes entirely absent or only indicated anteriorly on each wing. Cilia whitish. Antennae, head, thorax, and abdomen as in the wet-season specimens. Upperside left, underside right, illustration from Adalbert Seitz's work Female upperside, illustration from Seitz's work Female similar to the female of the wet-season brood, but more like the male, with the light silvery-blue suffusion very irregular, but generally extended much further outwards from the base. Underside: as in the male, the ground colour slightly darker. Other variations exist: Antenna, head, thorax and abdomen similar to those of the male. Food plants The eggs are laid on the host plants and the larvae hatch to feed on them. The plants include members of the Oxalidaceae including Oxalis corniculata, some Leguminosae and Acanthaceae. Other studies A study in Japan used this species to detect the side- effects of transgenic Bt corn, particularly by way of pollen falling onto leaves of the Oxalis host plants. No significant effect was found in that study.Yoichi Shirai; Mami Takahashi (2005) Effects of transgenic Bt corn pollen on a non-target lycaenid butterfly, Pseudozizeeria maha Applied Entomology and Zoology 40(1):151-159 Full text Other Japanese studies showed increased abnormalities in individuals of this species subjected to radiation following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.

Although the title of Town Mayor has only been in existence since the Local Government reforms of 1974, the Mayor is still able to be called Mayor of \\"Over\\". The original Town Hall near the river was burnt down in 1946 and the Council met for many years in a former manufacturer's mansion at Over Hall (now The Loont). This was deemed impractical for modern council business and the Council now has a cupboard in Wyvern House, offices for Cheshire West and Chester Council. Regalia In front of the mayor on civic occasions are two wardens each carrying a silver mace. The oldest dates from around 1660 and is made of silver around a wooden core. It was presented by the owner of Vale Royal Abbey mansion during this time, although it is unclear exactly by whom and when. It shows the arms of Cheshire and the arms of the Cholmondeley family below the crown. There is also a Tudor rose and a fleur-de-lys, emblems of England and France. There may have been an earlier mace, which was destroyed at the time of Oliver Cromwell, when maces were considered a sign of loyalty to Charles I. It is still in the possession of Winsford Town Council. The second mace was given in 1910 by Sir John Brunner the local MP. The original mace was taken to Kenya by Lord Delamere who was responsible in the 19th century for opening Kenya to white settlers. It was his property and he approved each mayor by presenting the mace. In 1946 his son, who had settled in Kenya, returned the old mace to Winsford when he sold the remaining family land. The mayor wears the red robe and hat made by the London robe makers to Queen Victoria and the gold chain of Office that was presented in 1894 to the former Urban District of Winsford. For many years an additional link was added to record the names of each Chairman and then Mayor. However, it eventually became so heavy that it was difficult to wear and the silver links were detached and put on display in the Town Council Chamber, which is furnished with heavy committee tables given by Sir John Brunner. Coat of arms The town's Coat of Arms consists of three salt baskets dripping brine in honour of the salt industry, the lion on a castle from the arms of the Verdin family who were great benefactors to the area a century ago, the three wheatsheafs of Cheshire and the three lions of England with a crozier, the emblem of Vale Royal Abbey.

A commonly used wireless LAN is a Wi-Fi network. Wireless LANs have inherent security weaknesses from which wired networks are exempt.Hacking Wireless Networks For Dummies by Kevin Beaver and Peter T. Davis, Wiley Publishing, Inc., 2005, pages 9-10. Wireless cracking is an information network attack similar to a direct intrusion. Two frequent types of vulnerabilities in wireless LANs are those caused by poor configuration, and those caused by weak or flawed security protocols. Wireless network basics *Wireless local-area networks are based on IEEE 802.11. This is a set of standards defined by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.Hacking Wireless Networks For Dummies by Kevin Beaver and Peter T. Davis, Wiley Publishing, Inc., 2005, page 9. *802.11 networks are either infrastructure networks or ad hoc networks. By default, people refer to infrastructure networks. Infrastructure networks are composed of one or more access points that coordinate the wireless traffic between the nodes and often connect the nodes to a wired network, acting as a bridge or a router. **Each access point constitutes a network that is named a basic service set or BSS. A BSS is identified by a BSSID, usually the MAC address of the access point. **Each access point is part of an extended service set or ESS, which is identified by an ESSID or SSID in short, usually a character string. **A basic service set consists of one access point and several wireless clients. An extended service set is a configuration with multiple access points and roaming capabilities for the clients. An independent basic service set or IBSS is the ad hoc configuration. This configuration allows wireless clients to connect to each other directly, without an access point as a central manager.Hacking Wireless Networks For Dummies by Kevin Beaver and Peter T. Davis, Wiley Publishing, Inc., 2005, pages 179-181. **Access points broadcast a signal regularly to make the network known to clients. They relay traffic from one wireless client to another. Access points may determine which clients may connect, and when clients do, they are said to be associated with the access point. To obtain access to an access point, both the BSSID and the SSID are required.Security Power Tools by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 102-103. *Ad hoc networks have no access point for central coordination. Each node connects in a peer-to-peer way. This configuration is an independent basic service set or IBSS. Ad hoc networks also have an SSID. Wireless network frames 802.11 networks use data frames, management frames, and control frames. Data frames convey the real data, and are similar to those of Ethernet. Management frames maintain both network configuration and connectivity. Control frames manage access to the ether and prevent access points and clients from interfering with each other in the ether. Some information on management frames will be helpful to better understand what programs for reconnaissance do. *Beacon frames are used primarily in reconnaissance. They advertise the existence and basic configuration of the network. Each frame contains the BSSID, the SSID, and some information on basic authentication and encryption. Clients use the flow of beacon frames to monitor the signal strength of their access point. *Probe request frames are almost the same as the beacon frames. A probe request frame is sent from a client when it wants to connect to a wireless network. It contains information about the requested network. *Probe response frames are sent to clients to answer probe request frames. One response frame answers each request frame, and it contains information on the capabilities and configurations of the network. Useful for reconnaissance. *Authentication request frames are sent by clients when they want to connect to a network. Authentication precedes association in infrastructure networks. Either open authentication or shared key authentication is possible. After serious flaws were found in shared key authentication, most networks switched to open authentication, combined with a stronger authentication method applied after the association phase. *Authentication response frames are sent to clients to answer authentication request frames. There is one answer to each request, and it contains either status information or a challenge related to shared key authentication. *Association request frames are sent by clients to associate with the network. An association request frame contains much of the same information as the probe request contains, and it must have the SSID. This can be used to obtain the SSID when a network is configured to hide the SSID in beacon frames. *Association response frames are sent to clients to answer an association request frame. They contain a bit of network information and indicate whether the association was successful. *Deauthentication and disassociation frames are sent to a node to notify that an authentication or an association has failed and must be established anew.Security Power Tools by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 103-105. Reconnaissance of wireless networks Wardriving is a common method of wireless network reconnaissance. A well-equipped wardriver uses a laptop computer with a wireless card, an antenna mounted on the car, a power inverter, a connected GPS receiver, and a way to connect to the internet wirelessly. The purpose of wardriving is to locate a wireless network and to collect information about its configuration and associated clients. The laptop computer and the wireless card must support a mode called monitor or rfmon.Security Power Tools by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 101-102. =Netstumbler= Netstumbler is a network discovery program for Windows.

With this support, Netstumbler displays GPS coordinate information next to the information about each discovered network, which can be useful for finding specific networks again after having sorted out collected data.Security Power Tools by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 105-106.

Penetration of a wireless network There are two basic types of vulnerabilities associated with WLANs: those caused by poor configuration and those caused by poor encryption. Poor configuration causes many vulnerabilities. Wireless networks are often put into use with no or insufficient security settings. With no security settings ‚Äì the default configuration ‚Äì access is obtained simply by association. Without sufficient security settings, networks can easily be defeated by cloaking and/or MAC address filtering. Poor encryption causes the remaining vulnerabilities. Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is defective and can be defeated in several ways. Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and Cisco's Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP) are vulnerable to dictionary attacks.Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, page 279. =Encryption types and their attacks= Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) WEP was the encryption standard firstly available for wireless networks. It can be deployed in 64 and 128 bit strength. 64 bit WEP has a secret key of 40 bits and an initialisation vector of 24 bits, and is often called 40 bit WEP. 128 bit WEP has a secret key of 104 bits and an initialisation vector of 24 bits, and is called 104 bit WEP. Association is possible using a password, an ASCII key, or a FMS attack and the chopping attack. The FMS attack ‚Äì named after Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir ‚Äì is based on a weakness of the RC4 encryption algorithm . The researchers found that 9000 of the possible 16 million initialisation vectors can be considered weak, and collecting enough of them allows the determination of the encryption key. To crack the WEP key in most cases, 5 million encrypted packets must be captured to collect about 3000 weak initialisation vectors. (In some cases 1500 vectors will do, in some other cases more than 5000 are needed for success.) The weak initialisation vectors are supplied to the Key Scheduling Algorithm (KSA) and the Pseudo Random Generator (PRNG) to determine the first byte of the WEP key. This procedure is then repeated for the remaining bytes of the key. The chopping attack chops the last byte off from the captured encrypted packets. This breaks the Cyclic Redundancy Check/Integrity Check Value (CRC/ICV). When all 8 bits of the removed byte were zero, the CRC of the shortened packet is made valid again by manipulation of the last four bytes. This manipulation is: result = original XOR certain value. The manipulated packet can then be retransmitted. This method enables the determination of the key by collecting unique initialisation vectors. The main problem with both the FMS attack and the chopping attack is that capturing enough packets can take weeks or sometimes months. Fortunately, the speed of capturing packets can be increased by injecting packets into the network. One or more Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) packets are usually collected to this end, and then transmitted to the access point repeatedly until enough response packets have been captured. ARP packets are a good choice because they have a recognizable size of 28 bytes. Waiting for a legitimate ARP packet can take awhile. ARP packets are most commonly transmitted during an authentication process. Rather than waiting for that, sending a deauthentication frame that pushes a client off the network will require that client to reauthenticate. This often creates an ARP packet.Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, pages 284-288. Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA/WPA2) WPA was developed because of the vulnerabilities of WEP. WPA uses either a pre-shared key (WPA-PSK) or is used in combination with a RADIUS server (WPA-RADIUS). For its encryption algorithm, WPA uses either the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) or the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). WPA2 was developed because of some vulnerabilities of WPA-PSK and to strengthen the encryption further. WPA2 uses both TKIP and AES, and requires not only an encryption piece but also an authentication piece. A form of the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is deployed for this piece.Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, page 285. WPA-PSK can be attacked when the PSK is shorter than 21 characters. Firstly, the four-way EAP Over LAN (EAPOL) handshake must be captured. This can be captured during a legitimate authentication, or a reauthentication can be forced by sending deauthentication packets to clients. Secondly, each word of a word-list must be hashed with the Hashed Message Authentication Code ‚Äì Secure Hash Algorithm 1 and two so called nonce values, along with the MAC address of the client that asked for authentication and the MAC address of the access point that gave authentication. Word-lists can be found at.Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, page 288. LEAP uses a variation of Microsoft Challenge Handshake Protocol version 2 (MS-CHAPv2). This handshake uses the Data Encryption Standard (DES) for key selection. LEAP can be cracked with a dictionary attack. The attack involves capturing an authentication sequence and then comparing the last two bytes of a captured response with those generated with a word-list.Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, page 289. WPA-RADIUS cannot be cracked.Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, page 281. However, if the RADIUS authentication server itself can be cracked, then the whole network is imperilled. The security of authentication servers is often neglected.Wireless Security Handbook by Aaron E. Earle, Auerbach Publications, 2006, page 196. WPA2 can be attacked by using the WPA-PSK attack, but is largely ineffective. =Aircrack-ng= Aircrack-ng runs on Windows and Linux, and can crack WEP and WPA-PSK. It can use the Pychkine- Tews-Weinmann and KoreK attacks, both are statistical methods that are more efficient than the traditional FMS attack. Aircrack-ng consists of components. Airmon-ng configures the wireless network card. Airodump-ng captures the frames. Aireplay-ng generates traffic. Aircrack-ng does the cracking, using the data collected by airodump-ng. Finally, airdecap-ng decrypts all packets that were captured. Thus, aircrack-ng is the name of the suite and also of one of the components.Security Power Tools by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 226-227. =CoWPAtty= CoWPAtty automates the dictionary attack for WPA-PSK. It runs on Linux. The program is started using a command-line interface, specifying a word-list that contains the passphrase, a dump file that contains the four-way EAPOL handshake, and the SSID of the network.Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, page 306. =Void11= Void11 is a program that deauthenticates clients. It runs on Linux.Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, pages 302-303. =MAC address filtering and its attack= MAC address filtering can be used alone as an ineffective security measure, or in combination with encryption. The attack is determining an allowed MAC address, and then changing the MAC address of the attacker to that address.Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, page 301. EtherChange is one of the many programs available to change the MAC address of network adapters. It runs on Windows.Wireless Security Handbook by Aaron E. Earle, Auerbach Publications, 2006, pages 319-320. =Conclusion= Penetration testing of a wireless network is often a stepping stone for penetration testing of the internal network. The wireless network then serves as a so-called entry vector.WarDriving & Wireless Penetration Testing by Chris Hurley and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2007, page 150.Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, page 311. If WPA-RADIUS is in use at a target site, another entry vector must be investigated.SSID : ANE- LX1%3803%CLoudClone Encryption : WPA Password : 40084012 Reconnaissance of the local-area network =Sniffing= A 'wireless' sniffer can find IP addresses, which is helpful for network mapping.Wireless Security Handbook by Aaron E. Earle, Auerbach Publications, 2006, page 301. Access points usually connect the nodes of a wireless network to a wired network as a bridge or a router.Security Power Tools by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, page 102. Both a bridge and a router use a routing table to forward packets.Sams Teach Yourself TCP/IP in 24 Hours, 4th edition, by Joe Casad, Sams, 2009, page 167. =Footprinting= Finding relevant and reachable IP addresses is the objective of the reconnaissance phase of attacking an organization over the Internet. The relevant IP addresses are determined by collecting as many DNS host names as possible and translating them to IP addresses and IP address ranges. This is called footprinting.Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, pages 2-3, 5-6. A search engine is the key for finding as much information as possible about a target.Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, page 36. In many cases, organizations do not want to protect all their resources from internet access. For instance, a web server must be accessible. Many organizations additionally have email servers, FTP servers, and other systems that must be accessible over the internet.Sams Teach Yourself TCP/IP in 24 Hours, 4th edition, by Joe Casad, Sams, 2009, page 178. The IP addresses of an organization are often grouped together. If one IP address has been found, the rest probably can be found around it.Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, pages 19, 25. Name servers store tables that show how domain names must be translated to IP addresses and vice versa.Sams Teach Yourself TCP/IP in 24 Hours, 4th edition, by Joe Casad, Sams, 2009, page 15. With Windows, the command NSLookup can be used to query DNS servers. When the word help is entered at NSLookup's prompt, a list of all commands is given.Sams Teach Yourself TCP/IP in 24 Hours, 4th edition, by Joe Casad, Sams, 2009, pages 201-202. With Linux, the command dig can be used to query DNS servers. It displays a list of options when invoked with the option -h only. And the command host reverses IP addresses to hostnames.Linux in a Nutshell, 6th edition, by Ellen Siever and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2009, pages 116-117, 197. The program nmap can be used as a reverse DNS walker: nmap -sL 1.1.1.1-30 gives the reverse entries for the given range.Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, page 29. ARIN, RIPE, APNIC, LACNIC, and AFRINIC are the five Regional Internet Registries that are responsible for the assignment and registration of IP addresses. All have a website with which their databases can be searched for the owner of an IP address. Some of the Registries respond to a search for the name of an organization with a list of all IP address ranges that are assigned to the name. However, the records of the Registries are not always correct and are in most cases useless.Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, pages 26-27. Probably most computers with access to the internet receive their IP address dynamically by DHCP. This protocol has become more popular over the last years because of a decrease of available IP addresses and an increase of large networks that are dynamic. DHCP is particularly important when many employees take a portable computer from one office to another. The router/firewall device that people use at home to connect to the internet probably also functions as a DHCP server.Sams Teach Yourself TCP/IP in 24 Hours, 4th edition, by Joe Casad, Sams, 2009, pages 215-217. Nowadays many router/DHCP devices perform Network Address Translation (NAT). The NAT device is a gateway between the local network and the internet. Seen from the internet, the NAT device seems to be a single host. With NAT, the local network can use any IP address space. Some IP address ranges are reserved for private networks. These ranges are typically used for the local area network behind a NAT device, and they are: 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255, and 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255.Sams Teach Yourself TCP/IP in 24 Hours, 4th edition, by Joe Casad, Sams, 2009, pages 61, 223-224. The relevant IP addresses must be narrowed down to those that are reachable. For this purpose, the process of scanning enters on the scene.Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit by Johnny Long and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2006, pages 3, 7. =Host scanning= Once access to a wireless network has been gained, it is helpful to determine the network's topology, including the names of the computers connected to the network. Nmap can be used for this, which is available in a Windows and a Linux version. However, Nmap does not provide the user with a network diagram. The network scanner Network View that runs on Windows does. The program asks for one IP address or an IP address range. When the program has finished scanning, it displays a map of the network using different pictures for routers, workstations, servers, and laptops, all with their names added.WarDriving & Wireless Penetration Testing by Chris Hurley and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2007, pages 112-115. The most direct method for finding hosts on a LAN is using the program ping. When using a modern flavour of Unix, shell commands can be combined to produce custom ping-sweeps. When using Windows, the command-line can also be used to create a ping-sweep. Examples are given in the reference.Security Power Tools by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 87-88. Ping-sweeps are also known as host scans. Nmap can be used for a host scan when the option -sP is added: nmap -n -sP 10.160.9.1-30 scans the first 30 addresses of the subnet 10.160.9, where the -n option prevents reverse DNS lookups. Ping packets could reliably determine whether a computer was on line at a specified IP address. Nowadays these ICMP echo request packets are sometimes blocked by the firewall of an operating system. Although Nmap also probes TCP port 80, specifying more TCP ports to probe is recommended when pings are blocked. Consequently, nmap -sP -PS21,22,23,25,80,139,445,3389 10.160.9.1-30 can achieve better results. And by combining various options as in nmap -sP -PS21,22,23,25,80,135,139,445,1025,3389 -PU53,67,68,69,111,161,445,514 -PE -PP -PM 10.160.9.1-30, superb host scanning is achieved. Nmap is available for Windows and most Unix operating systems, and offers graphical and command-line interfaces.Security Power Tools by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 34-37. Port scanning The purpose of port scanning is finding the open ports on the computers that were found with a host scan.Security Power Tools by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, page 37. When a port scan is started on a network without making use of the results of a host scan, much time is wasted when many IP addresses in the address range are vacant.Security Power Tools by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 35-36. =Open ports= Most programs that communicate over the Internet use either the TCP or the UDP protocol. Both protocols support 65536 so called ports that programs can choose to bind to. This allows programs to run concurrently on one IP address. Most programs have default ports that are most often used. For example, HTTP servers commonly use TCP port 80. Network scanners try to connect to TCP or UDP ports. When a port accepts a connection, it can be assumed that the commonly bound program is running. TCP connections begin with a SYN packet being sent from client to server. The server responds with a SYN/ACK packet. Finally, the client sends an ACK packet. When the scanner sends a SYN packet and gets the SYN/ACK packet back, the port is considered open. When a RST packet is received instead, the port is considered closed. When no response is received the port is either considered filtered by a firewall or there is no running host at the IP address. Scanning UDP ports is more difficult because UDP does not use handshakes and programs tend to discard UDP packets that they cannot process. When an UDP packet is sent to a port that has no program bound to it, an ICMP error packet is returned. That port can then be considered closed. When no answer is received, the port can be considered either filtered by a firewall or open. Many people abandoned UDP scanning because simple UDP scanners cannot distinguish between filtered and open ports.Security Power Tools by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 32-33. =Common ports= Although it is most thorough to scan all 65536 ports, this would take more time than scanning only the most common ports. Therefore, Nmap scans 1667 TCP ports by default (in 2007).Security Power Tools by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 37-39. =Specifying ports= The -p option instructs Nmap to scan specified ports, as in nmap -p 21-25,80,100-160 10.150.9.46. Specifying TCP and UDP ports is also possible, as in nmap -pT:21-25,80,U:5000-5500 10.150.9.46.Security Power Tools by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 38-39. =Specifying targets= Nmap always requires the specification of a host or hosts to scan. A single host can be specified with an IP address or a domain name. Multiple hosts can be specified with IP address ranges. Examples are 1.1.1.1, www.company.com, and 10.1.50.1-5,250-254.Security Power Tools by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 40-42. =Specifying scan type= TCP SYN scan Nmap performs a TCP SYN scan by default. In this scan, the packets have only their SYN flag set. The -sS option specifies the default explicitly. When Nmap is started with administrator privileges, this default scan takes effect. When Nmap is started with user privileges, a connect scan is performed. TCP connect scan The -sT option instructs Nmap to establish a full connection. This scan is inferior to the previous because an additional packet must be sent and logging by the target is more likely. The connect scan is performed when Nmap is executed with user privileges or when IPv6 addresses are scanned. TCP null scan The -sN option instructs Nmap to send packets that have none of the SYN, RST, and ACK flags set. When the TCP port is closed, a RST packet is sent in return. When the TCP port is open or filtered, there is no response. The null scan can often bypass a stateless firewall, but is not useful when a stateful firewall is employed. UDP empty packet scan The -sU option instructs Nmap to send UDP packets with no data. When an ICMP error is returned, the port can be assumed closed. When no response is received, the port can be assumed open or filtered. No differentiation between open and filtered ports is a severe limitation. UDP application data scan The -sU -sV options instruct Nmap to use application data for application identification. This combination of options can lead to very slow scanning.Security Power Tools by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 42-44. =Specifying scan speed= When packets are sent to a network faster than it can cope with they will be dropped. This leads to inaccurate scanning results. When an intrusion detection system or intrusion prevention system is present on the target network, detection becomes more likely as speed increases. Many IPS devices and firewalls respond to a storm of SYN packets by enabling SYN cookies that make appear every port to be open. Full speed scans can even wreak havoc on stateful network devices. Nmap provides five templates for adjusting speed and also adapts itself. The -T0 option makes it wait for 5 minutes before the next packet is sent, the -T1 option makes it wait for 15 seconds, -T2 inserts 0.4 seconds, -T3 is the default (which leaves timing settings unchanged), -T4 reduces time-outs and retransmissions to speed things up slightly, and -T5 reduces time-outs and retransmissions even more to speed things up significantly. Modern IDS/IPS devices can detect scans that use the -T1 option. The user can also define a new template of settings and use it instead of a provided one.Security Power Tools by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 45-47. =Application identification= The -sV option instructs Nmap to also determine the version of a running application.Security Power Tools by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, page 49. =Operating system identification= The -O option instructs Nmap to try to determine the operating systems of the targets. Specially crafted packets are sent to open and closed ports and the responses are compared with a database.Security Power Tools by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 49-50. =Saving output= The -oX option instructs Nmap to save the output to a file in XML format.Security Power Tools by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, page 51. Vulnerability scanning A vulnerability is a bug in an application program that affects security. They are made public on places such as the BugTraq and the Full-Disclosure mailing lists. The Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) brings out a statistical report every year. There were 8064 vulnerabilities counted in 2006 alone.Security Power Tools by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, page 269. Vulnerability scanning is determining whether known vulnerabilities are present on a target.Security Power Tools by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, page 55. Exploitation of a vulnerability An exploit takes advantage of a bug in an application. This can take effect in the execution of arbitrary commands by inserting them in the execution path of the program. Escalation of privileges, bypass of authentication, or infringement of confidentiality can be the result. =Metasploit= The Metasploit framework was released in 2003. This framework provided for the first time: *a single exploit database with easy updating, *freely combining of an exploit with a payload, *a consistent interface for setting options, and *integrated encoding and evasion, where: *an exploit is a code module that uses a particular vulnerability, *a payload is code that is sent along with the exploit to take some action, such as providing a command- line interface, *options are used to select variants of exploits and payloads, *encoding is modifying the payload to circumvent limitations, whether they are caused by the logic of the vulnerability or an inadequate IPS, and *evasion is bypassing security devices by employing evasion techniques. The basic procedure of using Metasploit is: choose an exploit, choose a payload, set the IP address and port of the target, start the exploit, evaluate, and stop or repeat the procedure.Security Power Tools by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 193-194, 219. Metasploit is not suited for finding the vulnerabilities of a host; a vulnerability scanner is. Alternatively, when a port scanner has found an open port, all exploits for that port may be tried.Security Power Tools by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 200-201. Metasploit 3.0 provides the following payloads: *VNC injection. This payload for targets that run Windows gives a graphical user interface to the target that is synchronized with the graphical user interface of the target. *File execution. This payload for targets that run Windows uploads a file and executes it. *Interactive shell. This payload gives a command-line interface to the target. *Add user. This payload adds a user with specified name and password that has administrator access. *Meterpreter. This payload gives a rich command-line interface to targets that run Windows.Security Power Tools by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 203-205, 325. VNC connections need a relatively large bandwidth to be usable, and if someone is in front of the compromised computer then any interaction will be seen very quickly. The command-line interfaces of Linux and OS X are powerful, but that of Windows is not. The Meterpreter payload remedies these shortcomings. The reference gives a list of Meterpreter commands.Security Power Tools by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 215-218. Maintaining control The ultimate gratification for a network intruder always is to obtain administrator privileges for a network. When an intruder is inside, one of his or her first undertakings is often to install a so-called rootkit on a target computer. This is a collection of programs to facilitate durable influence on a system. Some of these programs are used to compromise new user accounts or new computers on the network. Other programs are to obscure the presence of the intruder. These obscuring programs may include false versions of standard network utilities such as netstat, or programs that can remove all data from the log files of a computer that relate to the intruder. Yet other programs of a rootkit may be used to survey the network or to overhear more passwords that are travelling over it. Rootkits may also give the means to change the very operating system of the computer it is installed on. The network intruder then proceeds with creating one or more so called back doors. These are access provisions that are hard to find for system administrators, and they serve to prevent the logging and monitoring that results from normal use of the network. A back door may be a concealed account or an account of which the privileges have been escalated. Or it may be a utility for remote access, such as Telnet, that has been configured to operate with a port number that is not customary. The network intruder then proceeds with stealing files, or stealing credit card information, or preparing a computer to send spam emails at will. Another goal is to prepare for the next intrusion. A cautious intruder is protective against discovery of his or her location. The method of choice is to use a computer that already has been attacked as an intermediary. Some intruders use a series of intermediate computers, making it impracticable to locate them.Sams Teach Yourself TCP/IP in 24 Hours, 4th edition, by Joe Casad, Sams, 2009, pages 87, 275, 376-377, 385. =Back doors= The purpose of a back door is to maintain a communication channel and having methods to control a host that has been gained entry to. These methods include those for file transfer and the execution of programs. It is often important to make sure that the access or communication remains secret. And access control is desirable in order to prevent others from using the back door.Security Power Tools by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 323-324. Back Orifice 2000 was designed as a back door. The server runs on Windows, and there are clients for Windows, Linux and other operating systems. The server is configured easily with a utility. After configuration, the server needs to be uploaded to the target and then started. Back Orifice 2000 supports file transfer, file execution, logging of keystrokes, and control of connections. There is also an AES plug-in for traffic encryption and an STCPIO plug-in for further obfuscation of the traffic. The first plug-in adds security and the combination of these plug-ins makes it much harder for an IDS to relate the traffic to a back door. More information can be found at http://www.bo2k.com.Security Power Tools by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 334-335, 355-358. =Rootkits= Rootkits specialize in hiding themselves and other programs. Hacker Defender (hxdef) is an open source rootkit for Windows. It can hide its files, its process, its registry entries, and its port in multiple DLLs. Although it has a simple command-line interface as a back door, it is often better to use its ability to hide a more appropriate tool.Security Power Tools by Bryan Burns and others, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2007, pages 363-365. =Further reading= The Rootkit Arsenal: Escape and Evasion in the Dark Corners of the System by Bill Blunden, Jones & Bartlett Learning, 2009. Prevention and Protection An unprotected wireless network is extremely insecure. From anywhere within broadcast range, someone can eavesdrop or start using the network. Therefore, the IEEE 802.11 standard for wireless networks was accompanied with Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP). This security protocol takes care of the following: *authentication: assurance that all participants are who they state they are, and are authorized to use the network *confidentiality: protection against eavesdropping *integrity: assurance of data being unaltered WEP has been criticized by security experts. Most experts regard it as ineffective by now. In 2004 a draft for a better security protocol appeared, and it was included in the IEEE 802.11 standard in 2007. This new protocol, WPA2, uses an AES block cipher instead of the RC4 algorithm and has better procedures for authentication and key distribution. WPA2 is much more secure than WEP, but WEP was still in wide use in 2009. Many wireless routers also support controlling the MAC addresses of computers that are authorized to use a wireless network. This measure can effectively stop a neighbour from using the network, but experienced intruders will not be stopped.Sams Teach Yourself TCP/IP in 24 Hours, 4th edition, by Joe Casad, Sams, 2009, pages 161-162. MAC filtering can be attacked because a MAC address can be faked easily. In the past, turning off the broadcasting of the SSID has also been thought to give security to a wireless network. This is not the case however. Freely available tools exist that quickly discover an SSID that is not broadcast. Microsoft has also determined that switching off the broadcasting of the SSID leads to less security. Details can be found in Non-broadcast Wireless Networks with Microsoft Windows. Returning to encryption, the WEP specification at any encryption strength is unable to withstand determined hacking. Therefore, Wi- Fi Protected Access (WPA) was derived from WEP. Software upgrades are often available. The latest devices that conform to the 802.11g or 802.11n standards also support WPA2. (WPA uses the TKIP encryption, WPA2 uses the stronger AES method.) It is recommended to use only hardware that supports WPA or WPA2.Upgrading and repairing PC's, 19th edition, by Scott Mueller, Pearson Education, Inc., 2010, pages 900-901. Installing updates regularly, disabling WPS, setting a custom SSID, requiring WPA2, and using a strong password make a wireless router more difficult to crack. Even so, unpatched security flaws in a router's software or firmware may still be used by an attacker to bypass encryption and gain control of the device. Many router manufacturers do not always provide security updates in a timely manner, or at all, especially for more inexpensive models. WPS currently has a severe vulnerability in which the 8 pin numbered (0-9) passwords being used can easily be split into two halves, this means that each half can be brute-forced individually and so the possible combinations are greatly lessened (10^4 + 10^4, as opposed to 10^8). This vulnerability has been addressed by most manufacturers these days by using a lock down mechanism where the router will automatically lock its WPS after a number of failed pin attempts (it can take a number of hours before the router will automatically unlock, some even have to be rebooted which can make WPS attacks completely obsolete). Without a lock down feature, a WPA2 router with WPS enabled can easily be cracked in 5 hours using a brute force WPS attack. SSID's are used in routers not only to identify them within the mass of 2.4, 3.6, 5 and 60 GHz frequencies which are currently flying around our cities, but are also used as a \\"seed\\" for the router's password hashes. Standard and popular SSID's such as \\"Netgear\\" can be brute forced through the use of rainbow tables, however the use of a salt greatly improves security against rainbow tables. The most popular method of WPA and WPA2 cracking is through obtaining what's known as a \\"4 way handshake\\". when a device is connecting with a network there is a 4-stage authorization process referred to as a 4 way handshake. When a wireless device undergoes this process this handshake is sent through the air and can easily be monitored and saved by an external system. The handshake will be encrypted by the router's password, this means that as opposed to communicating with the router directly (which can be quite slow), the cracker can attempt to brute force the handshake itself using dictionary attacks. A device that is connected directly with the router will still undergo this very process, however, the handshake will be sent through the connected wire as opposed to the air so it cannot be intercepted. If a 4 way handshake has already been intercepted, it does not mean that the cracker will be granted immediate access however. If the password used contains at least 12 characters consisting of both random upper and lower case letters and numbers that do not spell a word, name or have any pattern then the password will be essentially uncrackable. Just to give an example of this, let's just take the minimum of 8 characters for WPA2 and suppose we take upper case and lower case letters, digits from 0-9 and a small selection of symbols, we can avail of a hefty choice of 64 characters. In an 8 character length password this is a grand total of 64^8 possible combinations. Taking a single machine that could attempt 500 passwords per second, this gives us just about 17,900 years to attempt every possible combination. Not even to mention the amount of space necessary to store each combination in a dictionary. Note: The use of MAC filtering to protect your network will not work as MACs using the network can be easily detected and spoofed. =Further reading= *Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment - Recommendations of the National Institute of Standards and Technology by Karen Scarfone, Murugiah Souppaya, Amanda Cody, and Angela Orebaugh, 2008. *WPA vs. WPA2: Is WPA2 Really an Improvement on WPA? by Frank H. Katz, 2009. Detection A network scanner or sniffer is an application program that makes use of a wireless network interface card. It repeatedly tunes the wireless card successively to a number of radio channels. With a passive scanner this pertains only to the receiver of the wireless card, and therefore the scanning cannot be detected. An attacker can obtain a considerable amount of information with a passive scanner, but more information may be obtained by sending crafted frames that provoke useful responses. This is called active scanning or probing. Active scanning also involves the use of the transmitter of the wireless card. The activity can therefore be detected and the wireless card can be located. Detection is possible with an intrusion detection system for wireless networks, and locating is possible with suitable equipment. Wireless intrusion detection systems are designed to detect anomalous behaviour. They have one or more sensors that collect SSIDs, radio channels, beacon intervals, encryption, MAC addresses, transmission speeds, and signal-to-noise ratios. Wireless intrusion detection systems maintain a registry of MAC addresses with which unknown clients are detected. =Further reading= *Wireless Intrusion Detection Systems by Jamil Farshchi, 2003. *Guide to Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) - Recommendations of the National Institute of Standards and Technology by Karen Scarfone and Peter Mell, 2007. Legality =The Netherlands= Making use of someone else's wireless access point or wireless router to connect to the internet ‚Äì without the owner's consent in any way ‚Äì is not punishable by criminal law in The Netherlands. This is true even if the device uses some form of access protection. To penetrate someone else's computer without the owner's consent is punishable by criminal law though.PC Plus (Dutch computer magazine), issue 04/2011, page 60. Crackers and society There is consensus that computer attackers can be divided in the following groups. *Adolescent amateurs. They often have a basic knowledge of computer systems and apply scripts and techniques that are available on the internet. *Adult amateurs. Most of them are motivated by the intellectual challenge. *Professionals. They know much about computers. They are motivated by the financial reward but they are also fond of their activity.Sams Teach Yourself TCP/IP in 24 Hours, 4th edition, by Joe Casad, Sams, 2009, page 376. =Naming of crackers= The term hacker was originally used for someone who could modify a computer for his or her own purposes. Hacking is an intrusion combined with direct alteration of the security or data structures of the breached system. The word hacking is often confused with cracking in popular media discourse, and obfuscates the fact that hacking is less about eavesdropping and more related to interference and alteration.Running Linux, 5th edition, by Matthias Kalle Dalheimer and Matt Welsh, O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2005, pages 829-830. However, because of the consistent abuse by the news media, in 2007 the term hacker was commonly used for someone who accesses a network or a computer without authorization of the owner.WarDriving & Wireless Penetration Testing by Chris Hurley and others, Syngress Publishing, Inc., 2007, page 4. In 2011, Collins Dictionary stated that the word hacker can mean a computer fanatic, in particular one who by means of a personal computer breaks into the computer system of a company, government, or the like. It also denoted that in that sense the word hacker is slang. Slang words are not appropriate in formal writing or speech.Collins Dictionary, 11th edition, HarperCollins Publishers, 2011, pages xi, 741. Computer experts reserve the word hacker for a very clever programmer. They call someone who breaks into computers an intruder, attacker, or cracker.

Along the way it intersects several major highways including U.S. Route 3 (US 3) in Chelmsford, Interstate 93 (I-93) in Wilmington, I-95 and Route 128 in Wakefield, and US 1 in Saugus and Lynnfield. Route description Route 129 begins at Route 110 in Chelmsford Center, where the northbound lanes of Route 4 leave Route 110. The route passes out of the town center to the east before intersecting U.S. Route 3 at Exit 29. It passes into Billerica, and shortly thereafter has a concurrency with Route 3A for just over a mile, following southbound on that route and crossing the Concord River. The route then turns eastward once more, heading over the Shawsheen River into Wilmington. In Wilmington, Route 129 becomes concurrent with Route 38, crossing Route 62 and passing the Wilmington MBTA station in the process. The two routes split south of the intersection, with Route 129 heading more southeasterly towards its intersection with Interstate 93 at Exit 38. After crossing I-93, Route 129 heads into Reading. The route crosses Route 28 just north of the town center before continuing eastward. At the town line with Wakefield, the route enters a rotary intersection with I-95/Route 128 at Exit 40, most of which is in the town of Wakefield. Shortly after leaving the rotary, and just after crossing the Saugus River, Route 129 turns southward along Main Street, following the eastern side of Lake Quannapowitt towards the town center. At Water Street, Route 129 turns eastward, passing the Center Depot, which is on the National Register of Historic Places and along the Haverhill Line (though currently without a stop). From Wakefield, Route 129 enters Saugus and Essex County. Passing the Breakheart Reservation, the route joins U.S. Route 1 at a cloverleaf intersection, following the route concurrently northward into Lynnfield. Route 129 eastbound in Swampscott In Lynnfield, Route 129 leaves Route 1 at the Lynnfield Tunnel, a traffic landmark just south of I-95 and Route 128. Just east of this point, Route 129 enters Goodwin Circle, which provides access to all three highways via a connector road. Immediately after leaving the circle, Route 129 enters the city of Lynn. In Lynn the route heads southeastward, above the Lynn Woods Reservation, twisting around Sluice Pond before meeting Route 129A next to Flax Pond. At this intersection, Route 129 turns southwest along Boston Street before turning southeast on Washington Street, where it crosses Route 107. After passing east of Lynn Common, the route splits, with the eastbound side staying on Washington Street and the westbound following Central Avenue and Exchange Street. Both directions meet again on Route 1A, staying concurrent with that route until meeting the eastern end of Route 129A, turning south before turning eastward once more an entering Swampscott. In Swampscott, Route 129 follows along King's Beach, above Black Will's Cliff and then along Fisherman's Beach before turning more inland, bypassing the Phillips Point neighborhood before coming close to the ocean once again in the Beach Bluff neighborhood as it enters Marblehead. Once in Marblehead, Route 129 continues along Atlantic Avenue before finally terminating at the corner of Atlantic and Ocean, where it meets the eastern end of Route 114. Atlantic Avenue continues into downtown Marblehead from this point, while Ocean Avenue heads across a short isthmus onto Marblehead Neck. History Route 129 (which was likely formed sometime in the 1920s) was originally a shorter route that only existed between Wilmington and Lynn, expanding to Marblehead by 1933 and to Chelmsford sometime in 1939. Prior to the construction of the Yankee Division Highway, Route 128 shared a short concurrency with Route 129 in Wakefield, joining the route at the intersection of Water Street and Main Street and leaving at the junction of Vernon Street and Water Street. In 1996, Route 129 had a realignment in Lynn, with the old route re-designated as Route 129A. This was done to bring the route through downtown. Major intersections Suffixed routes Route 129A is an east- west Massachusetts state route that serves as an alternate to Route 129, located entirely in Lynn, Massachusetts. The route was created in 1996, taking over the old routing of Route 129 in Lynn after it was realigned to enter downtown. The route starts where Route 129 leaves its old routing when it enters Lynn, heading southeast. It soon enters into a concurrency with Route 107 and goes northeast, but returns to going southeast when the concurrency ends. Route 129A ends at the end of a concurrency between Routes 1A and 129, when 129 returns to its older route.

Three deities ‚Äì Dharmaraj, Swarupnarayan, Madan ‚Äì were taken on large wooden horses and the ritual of ban-phonra (piercing of tongue, hand or breast with bamboo splinters) was performed by devotees from the lower castes such as Bauris, Khaira, Lohar and others. The village was predominantly populated by the people of lower castes, mainly Bauris, in earlier days. Some well-to-do trading families came and settled there and around two hundred years ago the zamindars, the Roy family, came in. Both belonged to the upper castes. The worship of Dharmathakur, in its present form, was taken up at Beliatore after both the zamindar and trading families had dreams about it. The worship of a popular folk deity of the lower castes was taken up by the upper caste people as per dream wishes and obviously as a part of the process of Brahminisation in the area. With the passage of time, the proportion of upper caste people in the village has gone up and that of the lower castes has come down. Manasa puja and Bhadu festival are celebrated in a big way. In earlier days, Jhapan Utsav, with display of live snakes, was celebrated in Beliatore, but it has been discontinued.Ghosh, Binoy, Paschim Banger Sanskriti, , part I, 1976 edition, pages 394-399, Prakash Bhaban, Kolkata Kachu Roy came and first settled in Jagannathpur and then moved to Beliatore, around 200 years prior to Binoy Ghosh‚Äôs visit.

She developed a primary school, which is still there. Initially she had a small number of upper caste students, but later collected a large number of Bauri students. Her move drew in bitter criticism from village folk. Sujankumari was 80 years old, but still active, when Binoy Ghosh visited Beliatore. When asked what the meaning of the word ‚ÄòBauri‚Äô was, she had explained how the word meant, ‚Äòthose who have been kept out of society‚Äô.

The approach involves coming up with a transformation of the nonlinear system into an equivalent linear system through a change of variables and a suitable control input. Feedback linearization may be applied to nonlinear systems of the form :\\\\begin{align}\\\\dot{x} &= f(x) + g(x)u \\\\qquad &(1)\\\\\\\\\\\\ y &= h(x) \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad &(2)\\\\end{align} where x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n is the state vector, u \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^p is the vector of inputs, and y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^m is the vector of outputs. The goal is to develop a control input :u = a(x) + b(x)v\\\\, that renders a linear input-output map between the new input v and the output. An outer-loop control strategy for the resulting linear control system can then be applied.  Feedback Linearization of SISO Systems  Here, consider the case of feedback linearization of a single-input single-output (SISO) system. Similar results can be extended to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In this case, u \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} and y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}. The objective is to find a coordinate transformation z = T(x) that transforms the system (1) into the so-called normal form which will reveal a feedback law of the form :u = a(x) + b(x)v\\\\, that will render a linear input-output map from the new input v \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} to the output y. To ensure that the transformed system is an equivalent representation of the original system, the transformation must be a diffeomorphism. That is, the transformation must not only be invertible (i.e., bijective), but both the transformation and its inverse must be smooth so that differentiability in the original coordinate system is preserved in the new coordinate system. In practice, the transformation can be only locally diffeomorphic, but the linearization results only hold in this smaller region. Several tools are required to solve this problem. = Lie derivative = The goal of feedback linearization is to produce a transformed system whose states are the output y and its first (n-1) derivatives. To understand the structure of this target system, we use the Lie derivative. Consider the time derivative of (2), which can be computed using the chain rule, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\dot{y} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}h(x)}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} &=\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}h(x)}{\\\\mathrm{d}x}\\\\dot{x}\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}h(x)}{\\\\mathrm{d}x}f(x) + \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}h(x)}{\\\\mathrm{d}x}g(x)u \\\\end{align} Now we can define the Lie derivative of h(x) along f(x) as, :L_{f}h(x) = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}h(x)}{\\\\mathrm{d}x}f(x), and similarly, the Lie derivative of h(x) along g(x) as, :L_{g}h(x) = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}h(x)}{\\\\mathrm{d}x}g(x). With this new notation, we may express \\\\dot{y} as, :\\\\dot{y} = L_{f}h(x) + L_{g}h(x)u Note that the notation of Lie derivatives is convenient when we take multiple derivatives with respect to either the same vector field, or a different one. For example, :L_{f}^{2}h(x) = L_{f}L_{f}h(x) = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}(L_{f}h(x))}{\\\\mathrm{d}x}f(x), and :L_{g}L_{f}h(x) = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}(L_{f}h(x))}{\\\\mathrm{d}x}g(x). = Relative degree = In our feedback linearized system made up of a state vector of the output y and its first (n-1) derivatives, we must understand how the input u enters the system. To do this, we introduce the notion of relative degree. Our system given by (1) and (2) is said to have relative degree r \\\\in \\\\mathbb{W} at a point x_0 if, :L_{g}L_{f}^{k}h(x) = 0 \\\\qquad \\\\forall x in a neighbourhood of x_0 and all k \\\\leq r-2 :L_{g}L_{f}^{r-1}h(x_0) eq 0 Considering this definition of relative degree in light of the expression of the time derivative of the output y, we can consider the relative degree of our system (1) and (2) to be the number of times we have to differentiate the output y before the input u appears explicitly. In an LTI system, the relative degree is the difference between the degree of the transfer function's denominator polynomial (i.e., number of poles) and the degree of its numerator polynomial (i.e., number of zeros). = Linearization by feedback = For the discussion that follows, we will assume that the relative degree of the system is n. In this case, after differentiating the output n times we have, :\\\\begin{align} y &= h(x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{y} &= L_{f}h(x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\ddot{y} &= L_{f}^{2}h(x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ y^{(n-1)} &= L_{f}^{n-1}h(x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ y^{(n)} &= L_{f}^{n}h(x) + L_{g}L_{f}^{n-1}h(x)u \\\\end{align} where the notation y^{(n)} indicates the nth derivative of y. Because we assumed the relative degree of the system is n, the Lie derivatives of the form L_{g}L_{f}^{i}h(x) for i = 1, \\\\dots, n-2 are all zero. That is, the input u has no direct contribution to any of the first (n-1)th derivatives. The coordinate transformation T(x) that puts the system into normal form comes from the first (n-1) derivatives. In particular, :z = T(x) = \\\\begin{bmatrix}z_1(x) \\\\\\\\\\\\ z_2(x) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ z_n(x) \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}y\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{y}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ y^{(n-1)} \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}h(x) \\\\\\\\\\\\ L_{f}h(x) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ L_{f}^{n-1}h(x) \\\\end{bmatrix} transforms trajectories from the original x coordinate system into the new z coordinate system. So long as this transformation is a diffeomorphism, smooth trajectories in the original coordinate system will have unique counterparts in the z coordinate system that are also smooth. Those z trajectories will be described by the new system, :\\\\begin{cases}\\\\dot{z}_1 &= L_{f}h(x) = z_2(x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_2 &= L_{f}^{2}h(x) = z_3(x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_n &= L_{f}^{n}h(x) + L_{g}L_{f}^{n-1}h(x)u\\\\end{cases}. Hence, the feedback control law :u = \\\\frac{1}{L_{g}L_{f}^{n-1}h(x)}(-L_{f}^{n}h(x) + v) renders a linear input- output map from v to z_1 = y. The resulting linearized system :\\\\begin{cases}\\\\dot{z}_1 &= z_2\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_2 &= z_3\\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_n &= v\\\\end{cases} is a cascade of n integrators, and an outer-loop control v may be chosen using standard linear system methodology. In particular, a state- feedback control law of :v = -Kz\\\\qquad, where the state vector z is the output y and its first (n-1) derivatives, results in the LTI system :\\\\dot{z} = Az with, :A = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & \\\\ldots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & \\\\ldots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\ldots & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -k_1 & -k_2 & -k_3 & \\\\ldots & -k_n \\\\end{bmatrix}. So, with the appropriate choice of k, we can arbitrarily place the closed-loop poles of the linearized system. = Unstable zero dynamics = Feedback linearization can be accomplished with systems that have relative degree less than n. However, the normal form of the system will include zero dynamics (i.e., states that are not observable from the output of the system) that may be unstable. In practice, unstable dynamics may have deleterious effects on the system (e.g., it may be dangerous for internal states of the system to grow unbounded). These unobservable states may be controllable or at least stable, and so measures can be taken to ensure these states do not cause problems in practice. Minimum phase systems provide some insight on zero dynamics.  See also  * Nonlinear control  Further reading  * A.

Cherni Vrah (, \\"Black Peak\\") is the summit of Vitosha Mountain in Bulgaria. Rising to 2290 m, the peak is the fourth highest mountain summit in the country after Musala (2925 m, Rila Mountain), Vihren (2914 m, Pirin Mountain), and Botev Vrah (2376 m, Balkan Range). Cherni Vrah is bounded to the northwest by Torfeno Branishte (Turf Nature Reserve) which ‚Äî like the extensive adjacent territory to the south ‚Äî is a no-go drinking water catchment area. Several major stone rivers are situated in the peak's vicinity, occupying the upper courses of Vladayska and Boyanska Rivers to the north, and Struma River to the south. The peak is part of the water divide between Black Sea and Mediterranean Sea, its northern slopes draining into Iskar River, and eventually into Danube River and Black Sea, and the southern slopes draining into Matnitsa River, flowing in turn into Struma River and Aegean Sea. Cherni Vrah hosts a weather station built in 1935, one year after the mountain became the oldest national park on the Balkans. The station provides refuge in bad weather (no tourist accommodation though), and has a well supplied cafeteria offering hot meals. A Mountain Rescue Service team is based on the peak too. The nearest mountain chalets are Aleko Chalet situated 3 km to the north-northeast (1810 m, major ski and snowboard centre accessible by gondola lift from Simeonovo, Sofia), and Kumata Chalet (1725 m) situated 5.5 km to the northwest. Ski paths link Cherni Vrah to Aleko and Kumata areas in winter, and a ski run on the northern slope of the peak itself is served by a 600-m surface lift. Torfeno Branishte Nature Reserve from Vrah Ushite (‚ÄòEars Peak‚Äô); Cherni Vrah in the background. With its annual average wind speed of 9.3 m/s Cherni Vrah is the second most windy peak in Bulgaria after Murgash Peak in the Balkan Range (10.3 m/s). The legend holds it that Cherni Vrah was climbed as early as 181 B.C. by King Philip V of Macedon. Nowadays, the easiest access to the peak is by a 1.4-km track from the upper station of Romanski chair lift situated on Malak Rezen Peak (2191 m). Cherni Vrah has a special place in Bulgarian tourism. Thanks to its proximity to Sofia the peak is by far the most visited mountain summit in the country, attracting tens of thousands of visitors annually. The first group of tourists to climb the peak involved 300 people, among them the contemporary doyen of Bulgarian literature Ivan Vazov, and was led by another famous Bulgarian writer, Aleko Konstantinov. The event took place on August 27, 1895, and annual tourist rallies are held on Cherni Vrah on that date considered the birthday of Bulgarian tourist movement. The etymology of the name Cherni Vrah (Black Peak) is uncertain. Popularly, it is attributed to the black colour of the conspicuous rock formations dominating the peak's tip. Another belief holds it that the name derived from the darker appearance the peak presumably had in the past, when the Subalpine zone of Vitosha used to be overgrown by mountain pine (Pinus mugo) that was burnt in the Middle Ages to expand sheep pastures. Nowadays only few isolated mountain pine communities have survived in the vicinity of Cherni Vrah, and their process of expansion and recovery is very slow.

The town also has a Maa Tarini temple, near the NAC Checkpost (which is not closed), in the dense forest =Ullapgarh= View of surrounding hillocks from Ullapgarh This is a hillock about fifteen minutes away from Belpahar Railway Station. It is said that the revolutionaries fighting in the freedom struggle of India took refuge in this hillock. The spaces carved out from the rock face to hold torches can be seen to this day. The journey uphill entails one to be of a strong disposition as the sun and the dry heat can take their toll on one's bodily fluids. But once the summit is reached, it is a view to behold. Greenery combined with the piercing silence is a great restorative. It would be advised to remember one's way up lest one may find themselves going down by a completely different path and hence get lost. It is a picnic spot. On the foot of Maheswar Pahad, there is a small village called \\"Ulap\\". About one kilometer from the village, the ruins of Ulapgarh are situated. At this place, the Maheswar pahad is about 1000 ft high and on the top there is a huge plain surface. On this rectangular plain stone surface the fort of Ulapgarh had been constructed. The plain stone fine surface is about 400 metre long and 250 metre wide. On the eastern side of the fort there are almost 7 km of densely forested Baramunda Hills and on the western side, the Belpahar Railway Station is located at a distance of 5 km. On the north there is a dense forest stretching up to Hemgir and in the south stretching up to Badjob village. A 12 ft (3.66 m) wide and 500 ft (150 m) long moat had been constructed which stretches from east to west. There was a Sivalingam and a place of worship in the Fort. A well had been dug on the stone floor which provided drinking water to the inmates of the Fort throughout the year. On the stone floor, there are many square holes and 70 round holes. The diameters of the hole vary from 1-3 inches. Wooden poles used to be put on these holes to support super structures for living room, store room, arsenals, kitchen, sleeping room, etc. About 1000 people could take shelter at Ulapgarh at a time. On the western side of Ulapgarh and down hill there is Ushakothi cave. On the walls and floors of this cave also there are many circular and square holes. Probably the defence personnel of the fort used to suspend there clothes and other belonging from wooden poles fitted to these holes. The soldiers of the dense forest of Maheswar hill could easily over power and defeat the enemies before they could climb up the hill and attack the fort. It is believed that Ulapgarh was being used as a residential fort by some kings of \\"Naja\\" Dynasty. This is being researched by both Indian and foreign researchers and historians.

It has a top that opens by raising and lowering. A moving \\"Glidercraft\\" ship will be extended from the pyramid when the pyramid is open. The \\"Glidercraft\\" will zigzag left-right, in front of the pyramid, with about 90 degrees of horizontal movement. This game also features two \\"Horus\\" targets. These are basically the reverse of drop targets: they are targets that, rather than dropping down into the playfield when hit, rise up into the air. Each target is attached to a large \\"Horus\\" structure, which is itself attached to a pivot that can raise and lower. These Horus structures drop down to block the player from reaching two key shots. The game occasionally raises them, allowing the player to temporarily make the shots.

Peptide YY is a short (36-amino acid) peptide released from cells in the ileum and colon in response to feeding. In the blood, gut, and other elements of periphery, PYY acts to reduce appetite; similarly, when injected directly into the central nervous system, PYY is also anorexigenic, i.e., it reduces appetite. Dietary fibers from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, consumed, increase the speed of transit of intestinal chyme into the ileum, to raise PYY3-36, and induce satiety. Peptide YY can be produced as the result of enzymatic breakdown of crude fish proteins and ingested as a food product.http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/mccormick/pdf/Murashita%20et%20al%202009.pdf Structure Peptide YY is related to the pancreatic peptide family by having 18 of its 36 amino acids located in the same positions as pancreatic peptide. The two major forms of peptide YY are PYY1-36 and PYY3-36, which have PP fold structural motifs. However, the most common form of circulating PYY immunoreactivity is PYY3-36, which binds to the Y2 receptor (Y2R) of the Y family of receptors. Peptide YY3-36 (PYY) is a linear polypeptide consisting of 34 amino acids with structural homology to NPY and pancreatic polypeptide. Release PYY is found in L cells in the mucosa of gastrointestinal tract, especially in ileum and colon. Also, a small amount of PYY, about 1-10%, is found in the esophagus, stomach, duodenum and jejunum. PYY concentration in the circulation increases postprandially (after food ingestion) and decreases by fasting. In addition, PYY is produced by a discrete population of neurons in the brainstem, specifically localized to the gigantocellular reticular nucleus of the medulla oblongata. C. R. Gustavsen et al. had found PYY- producing cells located in the islets of Langerhans in rats. They were observed either alone or co-localized with glucagon or PP. Function PYY exerts its action through NPY receptors; it inhibits gastric motility and increases water and electrolyte absorption in the colon. PYY may also suppress pancreatic secretion. It is secreted by the neuroendocrine cells in the ileum and colon in response to a meal, and has been shown to reduce appetite. PYY works by slowing the gastric emptying; hence, it increases efficiency of digestion and nutrient absorption after a meal. Research has also indicated PYY may be useful in removing aluminium accumulated in the brain. Animal studies Several studies have shown acute peripheral administration of PYY3-36 inhibits feeding of rodents and primates. Other studies on Y2R-knockout mice have shown no anorectic effect on them. These findings indicate PYY3-36 has an anorectic (losing appetite) effect, which is suggested to be mediated by Y2R. PYY-knockout female mice increase in body weight and fat mass. PYY-knockout mice, on the other hand, are resistant to obesity, but have higher fat mass and lower glucose tolerance when fed a high-fat diet, compared to control mice. Thus, PYY also plays a very important role in energy homeostasis by balancing food intake. PYY oral spray was found to promote fullness. Viral gene therapy of the salivary glands resulted in long-term intake reduction. Relevance to obesity Leptin also reduces appetite in response to feeding, but obese people develop a resistance to leptin. Obese people secrete less PYY than non-obese people, and attempts to use PYY directly as a weight-loss drug have met with some success. Researchers noted the caloric intake during a buffet lunch offered two hours after the infusion of PYY was decreased by 30% in obese subjects (P<0.001) and 31% in lean subjects (P<0.001). While some studies have shown obese persons have lower circulating level of PYY postprandially, other studies have reported they have normal sensitivity to the anorectic effect of PYY3-36. Thus, reduction in PYY sensitivity may not be one of the causes of obesity, in contrast to the reduction of leptin sensitivity. The anorectic effect of PYY could possibly be a future obesity drug. The consumption of protein boosts PYY levels, so some benefit was observed in experimental subjects in reducing hunger and promoting weight loss. This could partially explain the weight-loss experienced with high-protein diets, but the high thermic effect of protein appears to be the leading cause. Obese patients undergoing gastric bypass showed marked metabolic adaptations, resulting in frequent diabetes remission 1 year later. When the confounding of calorie restriction is factored out, Œ≤-cell function improves rapidly, very possibly under the influence of enhanced GLP-1 responsiveness. Insulin sensitivity improves in proportion to weight loss, with a possible involvement of PYY.

Weinbaum, first published in the December 1935 issue of Astounding Stories. As did his earlier stories \\"A Martian Odyssey\\" and \\"Parasite Planet\\", \\"The Mad Moon\\" emphasizes Weinbaum's alien ecologies. \\"The Mad Moon\\" was the only Weinbaum story set on Io. Weinbaum's Io In Weinbaum's Solar System, Jupiter radiates enough heat to create Earthlike environments on the Galilean moons. Io, the innermost Galilean satellite, has a tropical climate, so that two human settlements are located at the poles, Junopolis in the north and Herapolis in the south. Extending partway around the equator are the Idiots' Hills, whose peaks extend beyond Io's \\"dense but shallow\\" atmosphere. Weinbaum was ignorant that Io is tidally locked, and therefore showed Jupiter rise and set during the story. Two intelligent races are native to Io: the loonies, a humanoid race of only moderate intelligence with large balloonlike heads upon long, slim necks, and the rodentine, warlike slinkers. (Members of the Harrison Expedition to Mars encounter a slinker in the story \\"Valley of Dreams\\".) Another native is the parcat, a feline-like animal with a \\"single hind leg\\" and the ability to mimic phrases of human conversation. Ionan flora includes ferva leaves, used by pharmaceutical companies on Earth to create alkaloids; bleeding-grass, which exudes red sap; and stinging palms, named for venomous barbs. Plot summary It's the 22nd century and protagonist Grant Calthorpe is a former sport-hunter collecting ferva leaves for the Neilan Drug Company, living near the Idiots' Hills with a parcat named Oliver. To evade stinging palms in the Ionan jungle, he rewards loonies with chocolate to collect the ferva leaves for him. One day, suffering the native \\"white fever\\" and its \\"attendant hallucinations\\", Calthorpe follows Oliver to Lee Neilan, daughter of the owner of Neilan Drug, also affected by the fever. Each human believes the other a hallucination, until Calthorpe confirms her report of a newly built slinker settlement, whereupon he rescues her from the local slinkers. Having restored her health, he learns that she had crash-landed an aircraft against the Idiots' Hills while trying to reach Herapolis. When a party of slinkers undermines his shack, Calthorpe and Neilan flee into the Idiots' Hills, hoping the slinkers cannot follow them into the rarefied atmosphere. In a narrow valley between two peaks, they find a deserted city, apparently built by more-civilized previous generations of loonies. When opposed by the modern loonies, the slinkers form a narrow, dense mob, which Calthorpe destroys with a \\"flame pistol\\". This attracts Lee Neilan's father Gustavus, himself in search of her, and effects reunion. In gratitude to Calthorpe for saving his daughter, Gustavus offers him charge of a ferva plantation near Junopolis; whereupon Lee proposes her own marriage to Calthorpe.

During his professional career, in which he appeared for six clubs in three countries, he played in 228 Bundesliga games during 11 seasons. Football career Born in Krakow am See, Bezirk Schwerin, Reinke started playing senior football in his native East Germany with Dynamo Schwerin, moving in 1990 ‚Äì with the nation already reunified ‚Äì to Hamburger SV. There, he played his first game in the Bundesliga on 28 August 1991, a 0‚Äì3 home loss against Stuttgarter Kickers; that would be his only appearance for the first team in three years. After helping FC St. Pauli narrowly miss out on promotion from the second division, Reinke signed with 1. FC Kaiserslautern, where he won his first trophies: in 1996, the Palatinate Forest side suffered top flight relegation but managed to win the cup, 1‚Äì0 against Karlsruher SC. Reinke and Kaiserslautern immediately promoted back, amazingly repeating the feat of winning the league the following year, with the player conceding 53 in 56 matches both seasons combined. Deemed surplus to requirements in the 2000 summer, Reinke spent the following three years abroad, starting in Greece with Iraklis Thessaloniki F.C. then moving to Real Murcia after one year. With the Spaniards, he won the Ricardo Zamora Trophy in the 2002‚Äì03 campaign as the club returned to La Liga; apart from only conceding 21 in 40 games he still found the net, converting a penalty kick in a 2‚Äì1 home win over CD Numancia. Aged 34, Reinke returned to his country, signing with SV Werder Bremen. In his first year the club won the double, and he did not miss one second of action in that and the following seasons. However, he would be eventually pushed to the bench by younger Tim Wiese (who also played at Kaiserslautern) and retired from the game at the end of 2006‚Äì07, aged 38, having accomplished the feat of being the first goalkeeper to win the German championship with two different clubs. Reinke started his coaching career shortly after, briefly being in charge of Germany under-21s goalkeepers. In 2013, he signed for F.C. Hansa Rostock in the same predicament.

American rock band Kiss played at the Civic Center on Easter Sunday in April 1986, causing local church groups to protest the event. During the show, Kiss blew out half of the windows on the outside west wall of the Civic Center. The sound system they used on this tour was rated at 120 decibels. Before the show, Gene Simmons and Eric Carr of the band walked around the perimeter of the building, trying to hold polite conversations with the church groups. The concert went on as scheduled.

The adventure, module code X1, was originally published in 1981. Written by David \\"Zeb\\" Cook and Tom Moldvay, it is among the most widely circulated of all Dungeons & Dragons adventures due to its inclusion as part of the D&D; Expert Set. In the adventure, the player characters search for a lost treasure, journey to the prehistoric Isle of Dread, and there meet new nonhuman races. Plot summary The Isle of Dread is meant to introduce players and Dungeon Masters familiar with only dungeon crawl-style adventures to wilderness exploration. As such, the adventure has only a very simple plot, even by the standards of its time. The module has been described as a medium to high level scenario, which takes place on a mysterious tropical island divided by an ancient stone wall. (preview) The characters somehow find a fragment from a ship's log, describing a mysterious island on which many treasures can be found, and set out to explore it. Typically, the characters will first make landfall near the more or less friendly village of Tanaroa and after possibly dealing with some troublesome factions in the village, set out to explore the interior of the island. In the course of their explorations, they may find a number of other villages of unfamiliar intelligent creatures, numerous hostile monsters and the treasures they guard, and a band of pirates. Many prehistoric creatures, including dinosaurs, are prominently featured, especially in the original printing of the adventure. Near the center of the island is a hidden temple inhabited by monstrous, mind-bending creatures known as kopru; the characters may stumble across it or learn that it is a source of problems for the other inhabitants of the isle, and the climax of the adventure typically consists of the characters exploring this temple, battling its inhabitants, and uncovering its secrets. Publication history The Isle of Dread was the first published adventure for any version of Dungeons & Dragons to focus on wilderness exploration as a major theme. This would go on to be an important element in many other adventures, including most of the rest of the X-series. It also introduced numerous creatures to the game for the first time, including the kopru and aranea, both of which went on to find a place in the Third Edition Monster Manual; the rakasta and phanaton, both of which would later appear as playable races in other Dungeons & Dragons products set in Mystara; and many others, including several types of dinosaurs. This product marks the first appearance of the D&D; world continent that includes places such as Darokin, Karameikos, Ylaruam, and Thyatis. The adventure was loosely based on King Kong, and came with a fairly detailed (for its time) map of a setting then called the Known World, showing at least fifteen distinct nations on the mainland to the north, as well as much of the Sea of Dread in which the Isle of Dread could be found. These nations each received a paragraph or so of description near the beginning of the module. Two very different-looking versions of this adventure were printed. The first edition was printed in 1981, and the second edition in 1983; both were thirty two page books in an outer folder which featured cover artwork by Jeff Dee. The Isle of Dread was included in every copy of the 1981 version of the D&D; Expert Set as an example of an outdoor adventure and setting. This version is laid out in the style characteristic of early D&D; adventures: it had no Dungeons & Dragons logo, a diagonal strip in the top left corner indicated which edition of the game it was for, and the back cover featured an illustration and a list of other D&D; products of the time. It was available on its own and packaged with the original version of the Expert Set by David \\"Zeb\\" Cook. It was often sold already three-hole punched, and had several distinguishable printings of its own. The Isle of Dread was developed by Paul Reiche III, and edited by Jon Pickens with assistance from Harold Johnson, Patrick L. Price, Edward G. Sollers, Steve Sullivan, and David Cook.Cook, David \\"Zeb\\" and Tom Moldvay. The Isle of Dread (TSR, 1981) The module features art by Jeff Dee, David S. LaForce, Erol Otus, David C. Sutherland III, and Bill Willingham. The second version, which first appeared in 1983, was packaged with the revised version of the Expert Set by Frank Mentzer, and featured cover art by Timothy Truman. Its cover featured a red-orange border. The revised version used the layout elements that were typical of mid-1980s Dungeons & Dragons adventures: the game's current logo was prominently featured on the cover, the diagonal strip was replaced with a horizontal one across the top, and the back cover featured no illustration but did have a text description of the adventure. There are a few minor differences besides appearance between this and the earlier version, including the replacement of a few monsters, and a mapping error that makes part of the final temple appear to be completely inaccessible. The Isle of Dread is . In December 2018, Goodman Games published Original Adventures Reincarnated #2: The Isle of Dread under license from Wizards of the Coast. This three-hundred and twenty-eight page hardback contains reprints of the 1981 and 1983 editions, an interview with \\"Zeb\\" Cook, and a 5th edition conversion of the adventure. In other works The Isle is also a minor encounter area in the later adventure Lathan's Gold, and receives some further mention in several later D&D; products such as the Poor Wizard's Almanac series. Issue No. 114 of Dungeon magazine features an update on the Isle of Dread as a Greyhawk setting, a remake-sequel to The Isle of Dread entitled Torrents of Dread, and a poster- style map of the island, as well some smaller surrounding islands. In this update, the island was located in the Densac Gulf, a region bordered by the Azure Sea to the north, the Pearl Sea to the south, the Amedio Jungle to the west, and Hepmonaland to the east. This large expanse of ocean contains several island chains, one of which is the Isle of Dread itself. The update details a kopru plot that destroyed the city of the original Olman settlers through the power of a giant black pearl imbued with the influence of Demogorgon, the demonic god of the kopru. The isle has become a mad collection of kopru, other aquatic races, demonic beings, dinosaurs, and savage Olman natives. In the announcement for Dungeon's Savage Tide Adventure Path, Erik Mona mentioned that the Isle will be prominently featured in Savage Tide. Though most place names and other such references will be to the World of Greyhawk setting, Mona has stated that there will also be a number of Mystara references, in something of an homage to the Isle's roots. The first Savage Tide adventure set on the Isle of Dread is \\"Here There Be Monsters\\", found in Dungeon No. 142 (January 2007). The Isle of Dread remains the setting for the next three adventures: \\"Tides of Dread,\\" in issue No. 143; \\"The Lightless Depths,\\" in issue No. 144; and \\"City of Broken Idols,\\" in issue No. 145. The D&D; 4th edition supplement Manual of the Planes (2008) establishes the Isle of Dread as a location in the Feywild (a parallel plane dominated by faeries and unspoiled natural life) as part of its general reorganisation of the D&D; cosmos. The D&D; 5th edition Dungeon Master Guide (2014) places the Isle of Dread in the Plane of Water, though it mentions that the island has the ability to appear in the Material Plane. Reception Aaron Allston reviewed the adventure in The Space Gamer No. 38. He started by pointing out that \\"An introductory scenario must, first and foremost, be an enjoyable adventure. It must also provide a 'working model,' so that beginning DMs can see how to construct and organize an adventure. And it must be easily read, that the novice referee not become lost and confused with travelling from Crypt 1 to Village 3.\\" Allston continued by saying that \\"This adventure goes a long way towards accomplishing those goals. The scenario itself, set on an island whose simple human culture bears tinges of Polynesian and Amerind societies, is relatively tame, but provides some tense moments. Enough variable situations are presented to keep the whole thing from becoming static. More important, in this instance, is the module's organization as a prototype. It does well here, too; almost all the maps can be removed and the appropriate text descriptions are clearly keyed to the proper maps. This scenario cannot be played cold, which is also a necessary experience for a novice DM; it must first by read through and assessed.\\" He commented that \\"No real problems evidence themselves. As noted, this adventure will not appeal to experienced players; there is a certain lack of color or sweep to the whole thing.\\" Allston concluded his review by saying \\"Recommended to beginners only ‚Äì but it says so on the cover.\\" The Isle of Dread was ranked the 16th greatest Dungeons & Dragons adventure of all time by Dungeon magazine in 2004. After designer Tom Moldvay's death in 2007, Steve Winter called The Isle of Dread \\"Tom's work that had the widest impact\\", as its inclusion in the Expert Set \\"made it one of the most widely known and played adventures for years\\".

A Punjabi Qissa ( (Shahmukhi), (Gurmukhi); Plural: Qisse) is a tradition of Punjabi language oral story-telling that came to South Asia with the fusion of local people and migrants from the Arabian peninsula and contemporary Iran. Where Qisse reflect an Islamic and/or Persian heritage of transmitting popular tales of love, valour, honour and moral integrity amongst Muslims, they matured out of the bounds of religion into a more secular form when it reached India and added the existing pre-Islamic Punjabi culture and folklore to its entity. Etymology The word Qissa (pronounced ) is an Arabic word meaning ‚Äòepic legend‚Äô or a ‚Äòfolk tale‚Äô. It has influenced almost all the languages of South Asia and occurs as a regular common noun in Indo-Aryan languages like Punjabi, Bengali, Gujarati, Urdu and Hindi. If used informally, the word means an ‚Äòinteresting tale‚Äô or ‚Äòfable‚Äô. Qisse and the Punjabi culture The Punjabi language is famous for its rich literature of qisse, most of the which are about love, passion, betrayal, sacrifice, social values and a common man's revolt against a larger system. In the Punjabi tradition, friendship, loyalty, love and ‚Äòqaul‚Äô (verbal agreement or promise) are given utmost importance and most of the stories in the qisse hinge on these critical elements. Qisse are attributed to have inspired folk music in Punjabi and have added depth and richness to its delivery. These traditions were passed down generations in oral or written forms and were often recited, told as bedtime stories to children or performed musically as folk songs. Each qissa, if performed, has its unique requirements. A person able to sing or recite one may not necessarily transmit another. The vocal ranges of the musical scale and accurate pauses, if not performed well, leave a performer breathless and unable to continue. Most of the beats used in modern Punjabi music (often misleadingly labelled Bhangra), originated from qissa tradition and recitations in old times. Qisse also boast to be among the best poetry every written in Punjabi. Poetry based on Qisse Waris Shah's (1722‚Äì1798) qissa of ‚ÄòHeer Ranjha‚Äô (formally known as Qissa ‚ÄòHeer‚Äô) is among the most famous Qisse of all times. The effect of Qisse on Punjabi culture is so strong that even religious leaders and revolutionaries like Guru Gobind Singh and Baba Farid, etc., quoted famous Qissas in their messages. It will not be wrong to say that popularity and nearly divine status of Qisse in Punjabi actually inspired many generations of spiritual leaders and social activists to combine the message of God with teenage love tales. This gave rise to what is known as the Sufi movement in Punjab region. The most popular writer/poet to have written Punjabi Sufi Qisse was Bulleh Shah (c.1680-1758). So popular are his Kalams (poems) that he is frequently quoted by young and old alike with same respect and on matters of both love and God. In recent times, South Asian singer's have sported these folklores on their albums, for instance, the most famous folklore duo like Kuldeep Manak and Dev Tharike Wala wrote and sang about almost every Qissa, and Recently, Rabbi by (Rabbi Shergill) contained ‚ÄòBulla Ki Jaana Main Kaun‚Äô, translated in English as ‚ÄòI know not who I am‚Äô, written by Bulleh Shah. A few years back another singer, (Harbhajan Maan), a Canada-based Punjabi singer rejuvenated the story of ‚ÄòMirza Sahiban‚Äô, a work by Peelu. Daim Iqbal Daim from Mandi Bahauddin District, Pakistan also wrote many qissas in Punjabi language like Mirza Sahiban, Laila Majnu, Sohni Mahiwal, Bilal Biti etc. Daim got popularity by writing \\"Shah Nama Karbla\\" and \\"Kambal Posh\\".

The sharana Kumbara Gundaiah was from Bhalki who was part of Bhakthi movement. =The 1857 War of Independence= Bhalki's importance in the 1857 war is played out at the very end of the war, when one of Tatya Tope's followers is arrested and tried by the Nizam, in 1867. This person was Madho Rao, alias Rama Rao, the nephew of Shrimant Shahu Chatrapati, the Maharaja of Satara. He was also known as Jung Bahadur, as referred by Sir Richard Temple in his diaries. During a search, officials discovered that Jung Bahadur carried several papers in English and Marathi, translation of a deed of agreement and a seal saying he was the \`Chatrapati of Satara'. Jung Bahadur raised an army of over 1500 people in and around the forests of Bhalki, spending up to 20,000 Rupees. and gave 200 Rupees to his follower Deva Rao to recruit 500 soldiers. A jamadar got a monthly salary of 40 Rupees, a sepoy 30 Rupees and a sawar 10 Rupees. He recruited soldiers in the villages issuing them Kaulnamas or appointment letters, in which he asked young men to join him in the task of \\"murdering the British and regaining the lost glory of the Royal family of Satara\\". Jung Bahadur and his followers moved on foot from village to village, disguised as mendicants. He caused great damage to the British government, and captured a cantonment area called Ashti in Bidar district. He and his main followers were eventually arrested by two officers of the British resident in Hyderabad state. Their trial however, was conducted by the Nizam‚Äôs courts. The Magistrate of the criminal court, Moulvi Nasrullah Khan, completed the trial in less than a month, charging them with \\"trying to bring about insurrection against the empire\\". Jung Bahadur, Bheem Rao, Balakishtayya and Vithoba were sentenced to transportation to life. Jung Bahadur is said to have spent his last days in the Hyderabad prison, where he died. His followers Yeshwanta and Jehangir Ali were sentenced to 14 years of imprisonment. Others like Eshwanna Naikwadi and Vir Peddappa were given minor punishments.

Alcala (August 23, 1925 ‚Äì April 8, 2000) was a Filipino comics artist, born in Talisay, Negros Occidental in the Philippines. Alcala was an established illustrator whose works appeared in the Alcala Komix Magazine. His 1963 creation Voltar introduced him to an international audience, particularly in the United States. Alcala garnered awards in science-fiction during the early part of the 1970s. Biography Alfredo Alcala's lifelong interest in comic books began in childhood. He dropped out of school in his early teens to pursue a career in art, initially as a sign painter and commercial artist. Subsequently he took employment in an ironworker's shop, designing lamps and household furniture, as well as a church pulpit. During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in World War II he drew revealing pictures of their gear and position for the American forces. Inspired by the work of Lou Fine and other cartoonists, Alcala commenced with his comic book career in October 1948, beginning with an illustration in Bituin Komiks (Star Comics). By the end of the year he was drawing for Ace Publications, the Philippines' largest publishing company. Ace was the publisher of four titles (Filipino Komiks, Tagalog Klassiks, Espesial Komiks, and Hiwaga Komiks), each featuring his work. Ukala (1950) was one of his first major comics. Though his career rapidly expanded, Alcala never used assistants to complete his work. He said, \\"I somehow felt that the minute you let someone else have a hand in your work no matter what, it's not you anymore. Its like riding a bicycle built for two.\\" He eventually became a star of the Filipino comics scene, so famed that a periodical bore his name, the Alcala Komiks Magasin. In 1963 he created the comic book Voltar whose titular character predated Frazetta's interpretation of Conan the Barbarian which bore a more than passing resemblance. Voltar became an award winning success at home and eventually abroad. Alcala's mature artistic style reflected his interest in the woodcuts and etchings of Renaissance master Albrecht D√ºrer and the drawings of Australian illustrator Walter Jardine and U.S. illustrator Franklin Booth which bore the look of engravings. He has also cited the work of British artist Frank Brangwyn as a major influence. Fellow cartoonist Tony DeZuniga was the first Filipino artist to relocate to the United States to work for DC Comics in 1970, followed by Nestor Redondo and Gerry Talaoc. In 1971 Alcala began a decade of work for both DC and Marvel Comics on horror and fantasy titles, eventually moving to New York City in 1976. He was one of the artists on the licensed movie tie-in series Planet of the Apes and also helped recruit up-and-coming Filipino artists such as Alex Ni√±o to U.S. publishers. In 1975, Alcala and writer Jack Oleck created Kong the Untamed for DC Comics. Later that year, Alcala drew Marvel Treasury of Oz, a comics adaptation of The Marvelous Land of Oz. Alcala joined Warren Publishing in 1977 and drew 39 stories for that publisher from 1977‚Äì1981. His series Voltar was reprinted in issues #2‚Äì9 of The Rook. Alcala executed 12 five panel comic strips for the men's magazine Adam. The strip, Terra O'Hara, was written by Donald (Don) F. Glut and it appeared in 12 successive issues of Adam from December 1979, through November 1980. In the early 1980s he penciled the Star Wars newspaper strip and inked comic books such as Conan the Barbarian over John Buscema's pencils and inked Don Newton's pencil artwork in Batman. With the failure of DC's and Warren's horror titles in the 1980s, many of the Filipino contributors turned to the field of animation in California, and in the 1990s Alcala followed suit.

According to the 1968 law \\"Principles of Legislation on Marriage and the Family of the USSR and the Union Republics\\", parents are \\"to raise their children in the spirit of the Moral Code of the Builder of Communism, to attend to their physical development and their instruction in and preparation for socially useful activity\\".  Bolshevik woman in the Soviet household  Soviet women's journal founded in 1914 that featured relatively liberal content The role of the Bolshevik woman has been of much controversy, particularly at the beginning of the post-revolutionary Russian era. Prior to this revolution, the role of the Bolshevik woman was to tend to the household. Making sure the children were brought up in the traditional Soviet way of life was of utmost importance in the household of the average Bolshevik. The average woman would prepare a meal that consisted of bread, vegetables and broth; and for wealthier families cheese, and a source of protein. In Bolshevik folklore the mother had the influential role of raising the children in the household; specifically about the household, values and the culture that would be represented among family members. The success and the rise of the Bolshevik regime, and the downfall of Czar Nicholas II and essentially his entire family, would subsequently leave a unique opportunity for the women of Russia. The Revolutionary War, and the large number of soldiers necessary to have an adequate defense left a void in the industrial sectors of the workforce, and that void was filled with hundreds of thousands of women, who had to assume the role left absent, by soldier fathers. As a platform Bolshevism advocated for the evolution of traditional gender roles; instead offering opportunities for women inside of the party when the Department for Work Among Women was created in 1919. Despite this strong push for change by the Zhenotdel, the immensely patriarchal society that had existed for hundreds of years prior, would supersede these efforts. The feminist movement was seen by the majority peasant and workforce population as bourgeois, and therefore represented something opposite of the Bolshevik idea. The emphasis on the immediate household as priority was pertinent, especially to the 1930s era of Soviet Russia. Since the Paleolithic era of Russia, there has been a fascination with the immortalization, of the mother figure. \\"The Motherland Calls\\", statute spoke up about the unrealistic expectations that the Soviet Union had on their female mothers. Motherhood, they posited, was not some divine consciousness, but instead something inherently learned as a result of being a woman. Some argued that the traditional role of the mother should be challenged, and that it was not like it had been in years passed. In many instances the domestic work was piled onto the female head of the house, despite promotion of equality between genders. This left in unequal workload on the woman, who would also have a job outside of the home to help provide in a particularly difficult economy where food and adequate housing was often scarce. However, despite this argument, the role of the Bolshevik woman remained static. Stalin himself held both men and women to the same standard, with equal harshness doled out to both sexes. In the 1960s, it was expected of the Russian woman to fall in line with the patriarchal leadership of her husband.  Bolshevik vision of the family  Marxist theory on family established the revolutionary ideal for the Soviet state and influenced state policy concerning family in varying degrees throughout the history of the country. The principals are: The nuclear family unit is an economic arrangement structured to maintain the ideological functions of Capitalism. The family unit perpetuates class inequality through the transfer of private property through inheritance. Following the abolition of private property, the bourgeois family will cease to exist and the union of individuals will become a ‚Äúpurely private affair‚Äù. The Soviet state‚Äôs first code on marriage and family was written in 1918 and enacted a series of trans-formative laws designed to bring the Soviet family closer in line with Marxist theory.  1918 Code on Marriage, the Family and Guardianship  One year after the Bolsheviks took power, they ratified the 1918 Code on Marriage, the Family and Guardianship. The revolutionary jurists, led by Alexander Goikhbarg, adhered to the revolutionary principals of Marx, Engels, and Lenin when drafting the codes. Goikhbarg considered the nuclear family unit to be a necessary but transitive social arrangement that would quickly be phased out by the growing communal resources of the state and would eventually ‚Äúwither away‚Äù. The jurists intended for the code to provide a temporary legal framework to maintain protections for women and children until a system of total communal support could be established. The 1918 code also served to recognize the legal rights of the individual at the expense of the existing tsarist/patriarchal system of family and marriage. This was accomplished by allowing easily obtainable ‚Äúno-grounds‚Äù divorces. It abolished ‚Äúillegitimacy‚Äù of birth as a legal concept and entitled all children to parental support. It abolished the adoption of orphans (orphans would be cared for by the state to avoid exploitation). A married couple could take either surname. Individual property would be retained in the event of divorce. An unlimited term of alimony could be awarded to either spouse, but upon separation each party was expected to care for themselves. Women were to be recognized as equal under the law; Prior to 1914, women were not allowed to earn a wage, seek education, or exchange property without the consent of her husband.  Family Code of 1926  The 1918 code accomplished many of the goals that the jurists had sought to set into motion, but the social disruption left in the wake of World War I exposed the inadequacies of the code to alleviate social problems. The 1926 code would revive a more conservative definition of the family in a legal sense. ‚ÄúThe 1918 code had been motivated by a desire to lead society forward to new social relationships in line with socialist thought on marriage and family, the 1926 code attempted to solve immediate problems, in particular to ensure the financial well- being‚Äù. The hotly debated social concerns included: the unmanageable number of orphans, the unemployment of women, the lack of protection after divorce, common property and divorce, and the obligations of unmarried, cohabitating partners. In 1921 alone, seven million orphans were displaced, roaming town and countryside. Government agencies simply did not have the resources to care for the children. An adopted child could be cared for by a family at virtually no cost to the state. The 1926 code would reinstate adoption as a solution for child homelessness. In 1921 New Economic Policy (NEP), brought about a limited restoration of private enterprise and free markets. It also brought an end to labor conscription. The result was a spike in female unemployment as ‚ÄúWar Communism‚Äù came to an end and NEP emerged. Hundreds of thousands of unemployed women did not have registered marriages and were left with no means of support or protections following a divorce under the 1918 code. The 1926 code would make unregistered marriages legal in order to safeguard women by extending alimony to unregistered, de facto wives, the purpose being that more women would be cared for in times of widespread unemployment. Under the 1918 code, there was no division of property in the event of a divorce. Marriage was not to be an economic partnership and each party was entitled to individual property. This meant that women who ran the household and cared for the children would not be entitled to any material share of what the ‚Äúprovider‚Äù had brought to the marriage. In another conservative move, the 1926 code would require an equal division of property acquired during a marriage. All property acquired during the course of a marriage would become ‚Äúcommon‚Äù. With intentions similar to the legal recognition of de facto marriages, this new property law was a response to the lack of protections offered to women in the event of divorce. Additionally the code would do away with the 1918 concept of ‚Äúcollective paternity‚Äù where multiple men could be assigned to pay alimony if the father of a child could not be determined. According to the 1926 code, paternity could be assigned by a judge. It also enlarged family obligations by expanding alimony obligations to include children, parents, siblings and grandparents. Alimony would also have set time limits. The 1926 code would signal a retreat from many policies that served to weaken the family in 1918. The jurists were not pursuing an ideological maneuver away from socialism, rather than taking more ‚Äútemporary‚Äù measures to ensure the well-being of women and children since communal care had yet to materialize.  Family Code of 1936  Unlike earlier codes that arranged for temporary and transitive laws as a step toward the revolutionary vision of family; the Code of 1936 marked an ideological shift away from Marxist / revolutionary visions of the nuclear family. Coinciding with the rise of Stalinism, the law demanded the stabilizing and strengthening of the family. ‚ÄúThe ‚Äúwithering-away‚Äù doctrine, once central to socialist understand of the family, law, and the state, was anathematized.‚Äù The 1936 code emerged among along with an eruption of pro- family propaganda. For the first time, the code put restrictions on abortion and imposed fines and jail time for any that received or performed the service. The code also enacted a bevy of laws aimed to encourage pregnancy and child birth. Insurance stipends, pregnancy leave, job security, light duty, child care services and payments for large families. In another drastic move, the code made it more difficult to obtain a divorce. Under the code, both parties would need to be present for a divorce and pay a fine. There could be harsh penalties for those who failed to pay alimony and child-support payments. ‚ÄúOur demands grow day to day. We need fighters, they build this life. We need people.‚Äù The wider campaign to encourage the family unit elevated motherhood to a form of Stakhanovite labor. During this time, motherhood was celebrated as patriotic and the joys of children and family were extolled by the country‚Äôs leaders.  Family Edict of 1944  The Family Edict of 1944 would be a continuation of the conservative trending of the 1936 code. Citing the heavy manpower losses and social disruption following World War II, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet enacted laws that would further encourage marriage and childbirth. The 1944 Edict offered greater state- sponsored benefits to mothers, including: Extended maternity leave, increased family allowances even to unmarried mothers, promises of burgeoning child care services, targeted labor protections, and most notably, state recognition and the honorary title ‚ÄúMother Heroine‚Äù for mothers who could produce large families. The edict also sought to preserve the family unit by making divorces even more difficult to obtain. Fines were increased and the parties were often ordered to attempt reconciliation. Divorce also became a public matter. Divorcees were required to appear in public court and their intent was published in the local newspaper.  Evolution of the Soviet family  The early Soviet state sought to remake the family, believing that although the economic emancipation of workers would deprive families of their economic function, it would not destroy the institution but rather base family relations exclusively on mutual affection. The Bolsheviks replaced religious marriage with civil marriage, divorce became easy to obtain, and unwed mothers received special protection. All children, whether legitimate or illegitimate, had equal rights before the law, women gained sexual equality under matrimonial law, inheritance of property was abolished, and abortion was legalized. Text used in this cited section originally came from: Soviet Union Country Study from the Library of Congress Country Studies project. In the early 1920s, however, the weakening of family ties, combined with the devastation and dislocation caused by the Russian Civil War (1918‚Äì21), resulted in nearly 7 million homeless children. This situation prompted senior Bolshevik Party officials to conclude that the State needed a more stable family life to rebuild the country's economy and shattered social structure. By 1922 the government allowed some forms of inheritance, and after 1926 full inheritance rights were restored. By the late 1920s, adults had been made more responsible for the care of their children, and common-law marriage had been given equal legal status with civil marriage. Reconstruction of a typical 1950s Soviet living room During Joseph Stalin's rule (late 1920s to 1953), the trend toward strengthening the family continued. In 1936 the government began to award payments to women with large families, banned abortions, and made divorces more difficult to obtain. In 1942 it subjected single persons and childless married persons to additional taxes. In 1944 only registered marriages were recognized to be legal, and divorce became subject to court discretion. In the same year the government began to award medals to women who gave birth to five or more children and took upon itself the support of illegitimate children. After Stalin's death in 1953, the government moved in a more revisionist direction and rescinded some of its natalist legislation. In 1955 it declared abortions for medical reasons legal, and in 1968 it declared all abortions legal, following Western European policy. The state also liberalized divorce procedures in the mid-1960s, but in 1968 introduced new limitations. In 1974 the government began to subsidize poorer families whose average per-capita income did not exceed 50 rubles per month (later raised to 75 rubles per month in some northern and eastern regions). The subsidy amounted to 12 rubles per month for each child below eight years of age. It was estimated that in 1974 about 3.5 million families (14 million people, or about 5% of the entire population) received this subsidy. With the increase in per-capita income, however, the number of children requiring such assistance decreased. In 1985 the government raised the age limit for assistance to twelve years and under. In 1981 the subsidy to an unwed mother with a child increased to 20 rubles per month; in early 1987 an estimated 1.5 million unwed mothers were receiving such assistance, or twice as many as during the late 1970s.  Family size  Family size and composition depended mainly on the place of residence‚Äîurban or rural‚Äîand ethnic group. The size and composition of such families was also influenced by housing and income limitations, pensions, and female employment outside the home. The typical urban family consisted of a married couple, two children, and, in about 20% of the cases, one of the grandmothers, whose assistance in raising the children and in housekeeping was important in the large majority of families having two wage earners. Rural families generally had more children than urban families and often supported three generations under one roof. Families in Central Asia and the Caucasus tended to have more children than families elsewhere in the Soviet Union and included grandparents in the family structure. In general, the average family size followed that of other industrialized countries, with higher income families having both fewer children and a lower rate of infant mortality. From the early 1960s to the late 1980s, the number of families with more than one child decreased by about 50% and in 1988 totaled 1.9 million. About 75% of the families with more than one child lived in the southern regions of the country, half of them in Central Asia. In the Russian, Ukrainian, Belorussian, Moldovian, Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian republics, families with one and two children constituted more than 90% of all families, whereas in Central Asia those with three or more children ranged from 14% in the Kyrgyz Republic to 31% in the Tajik. Surveys suggested that most parents would have had more children if they had had more living space. Beginning in the mid-1980s, the government promoted family planning in order to slow the growth of the Central Asian indigenous populations. Local opposition to this policy surfaced especially in the Uzbek and Tajik republics. In general, however, the government continued publicly to honor mothers of large families. Women received the Motherhood Medal, Second Class, for their fifth live birth and the Mother Heroine medal for their tenth. Most of these awards went to women in Central Asia and the Caucasus.  Reproduction and family planning  The primary form of contraception practiced in the early USSR was coitus interruptus. Scarcity of rubber made condoms and diaphragms unavailable, and contraception was rarely discussed by political figures. The U.S.S.R. was the first country in the world to legalize abortion. For many years prior to the October Revolution, abortion was not uncommon in Russia, although it was illegal and carried a possible sentence of hard labor or exile. After the revolution, famine and poor economic conditions led to an increase in the number of ‚Äúback alley‚Äù abortions, and after pressure from doctors and jurists, the Commissariats of Health and Justice legalized abortion in 1920. Abortions were free for all women, although they were seen as a necessary evil due to economic hardship rather than a woman‚Äôs right to control her own reproductive system. Through the 1930s, a rising number of abortions coupled with a falling birthrate alarmed Soviet officials, with a recorded 400,000 abortions taking place in 1926 alone. In 1936 the Soviet Central Executive Committee made abortion illegal once again. This, along with stipends granted to recent mothers and bonuses given for women who bore many children, was part of an effort to combat the falling birthrate.  Family and kinship structures  The extended family was more prevalent in Central Asia and the Caucasus than in the other sections of the country and, generally, in rural areas more than in urban areas. Deference to parental wishes regarding marriage was particularly strong in these areas, even among the Russians residing there. Extended families helped perpetuate traditional life-styles. The patriarchal values that accompany this life-style affected such issues as contraception, the distribution of family power, and the roles of individuals in marriage and the family. For example, traditional Uzbeks placed a higher value on their responsibilities as parents than on their own happiness as spouses and individuals. The younger and better educated Uzbeks and working women, however, were more likely to behave and think like their counterparts in the European areas of the Soviet Union, who tended to emphasize individual careers. Extended families were not prevalent in the cities. Couples lived with parents during the first years of marriage only because of economics or the housing shortage. When children were born, the couple usually acquired a separate apartment.  Function of the family  queuing to a Kharkov cinema,1981 The government assumed many functions of the pre-Soviet family. Various public institutions, for example, took responsibility for supporting individuals during times of sickness, incapacity, old age, maternity, and industrial injury. State-run nurseries, preschools, schools, clubs, and youth organizations took over a great part of the family's role in socializing children. Their role in socialization was limited, however, because preschools had places for only half of all Soviet children under seven. Despite government assumption of many responsibilities, spouses were still responsible for the material support of each other, minor children, and disabled adult children. The transformation of the patriarchal, three-generation rural household to a modern, urban family of two adults and two children attests to the great changes that Soviet society had undergone since 1917. That transformation did not produce the originally envisioned egalitarianism, but it has forever changed the nature of what was once the Russian Empire.  Diet and nutrition of the Soviet family  The history of the Soviet Union diet prior to World War II encompasses different periods that have varying influences on food production and availability. Periods of low crop yields, and restrictive distribution of food in the early 1920s, and again in the early 1930s brought about great famine and suffering in the Soviet Union. Farming was one of the main efforts for food production, and was at the center of development in support of Soviet communism. When crops failed or suffered from low yields, Soviet peasants suffered greatly from malnutrition. The traditional types of food found in the Soviet Union were made up of various grains for breads and pastries, dairy products such as cheese and yogurt, and various meats such as pork, fish, beef and chicken. Vegetables were less abundant than the other forms of food due to the strain on resources and poor crop yields. Potatoes were a very important staple for Soviet families. Potatoes were easily grown and harvested in many different environments, and were usually reliable as a food source. Malnutrition was a prominent factor in poor health conditions and individual growth during this period in the Soviet Union. Much like the Western tradition of three main meals a day, the Soviet meals consisted of breakfast (zavtrak), lunch (obed), and dinner (uzhin). Soups and broths made of meats and vegetables when available, were common meals for the Soviet peasant Family.

Andrew Lang included it in The Pink Fairy Book. It is Aarne-Thompson type 328, the boy steals the giant's treasures. Synopsis An older brother was jealous of his younger brother and one day tied him to a tree to be rid of him. An old, humpbacked shepherd saw him and asked him why; the younger brother said it was to straighten out his back, and persuaded the shepherd to be tied there in his place. Then he drove off the sheep. He persuaded a horse boy and a driver of oxen to come with him. He played many tricks and became famous. The king captured him, said he had earned death, and promised to spare him if he brought him the dragon's flying horse. He went and tried three times to steal the horse. Each time it neighed, alerting the dragon, but the third time the dragon, annoyed at being awoken, beat the horse. The fourth time, the horse did not neigh, the boy led him out, and once out, he mounted and rode off, taunting the dragon. The king then demanded the dragon's bed coverings. The boy went and tried to hook the blanket during the night, but the dragon said his wife was hogging them, and pulled them, pulling the boy down. The dragon tied him and told his wife to cook him the next day while he went to church. When he returned, they would eat him. The dragoness untied him to cut his throat more easily, and the boy cut her throat and threw her into the oven. He stole the bedcoverings and returned to the king. The king then demanded the dragon itself. The boy demanded two years to let his beard grow as a disguise, and the king agreed. When the two years were up, the youth changed clothing with a beggar and found the dragon making a box, in order to trap him in it. The youth said that the box was too small. The dragon assured him that it was big enough even for himself and wriggled in to show him. The youth clapped on the top and told him to see if the youth would be able to escape. The dragon tried as hard as it could, and could not get out. The youth brought him back to the king. The king wanted to see the dragon. He was careful enough to open a hole too small for the dragon to escape, but not enough to keep it from biting him and swallowing him whole. The youth married the king's daughter and became king in his place.

Description Hole-in-the-Rock is a series of openings (tafoni) eroded in a small hill composed of bare red arkosic conglomeritic sandstone. The sandstone was first formed some 6-15 million years ago from the accumulation of materials eroding from a Precambrian granite, long since eroded away. The tafoni are thought to have been eroded by water. An open, shelter-like chamber in the face of the formation communicates with the rear of the formation via a hole eroded completely through the rock. Another substantial opening exists in the \\"ceiling\\" of the chamber. There is evidence that the Hohokam, early inhabitants of the region, used and recorded the position of sunlight shining through the latter opening to mark the seasons-- notably the equinoxes and the solstices, which were marked by carving a slick area (metate) in the rock. Other positions were marked with boulders. The formation is a popular attraction in the park. The openings and main chamber, near the summit, are easily accessible via a smoothly ascending path that passes behind the hill. It is also possible to climb the face of the hill to reach the chamber, although this is dangerous for the inexperienced. The chamber provides a good view of the city of Phoenix west of the park. A nearly constant wind blows through the openings in the rock.

Zamba is a traditional dance of Argentina. It is a style of Argentine music and Argentine folk dance. Zamba is very different from its homophone, the samba - musically, rhythmically, temperamentally, in the steps of the dance and in its costume. It has six beats to the bar and is a majestic dance, performed by couples who circle each other waving white handkerchiefs very elegantly. It has common elements with the cueca. Zambas are composed about many themes, from those that celebrate people or events of Argentine history, to those that describe the beauty of a region, or of its women. There are zambas of political protest, and even one called Aerol√≠neas Argentinas. The bombo leg√ºero drum is prominent in the playing of the zamba. Name and Origin The name \\"zamba\\" refers to a colonial term for zambo (people that are descendants of Amerindian and African people). It is therefore called zamba because its lyrical content was aimed at its native listeners. The dance originated in the Argentine province of Salta in the Creole genre known as the zamacueca of Peru, in 1824 at the same time that Peru, under Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, obtained independence.

The company was founded in 2004 to commercialise a number of drug combinations developed by Professor Thomas Borody, a Sydney-based gastroenterologist. History Giaconda was named after the Giaconda Vineyard and Winery, which is located nine kilometres southwest of Beechworth in the northeastern part of the Australian state of Victoria. That vineyard in turn derives its name from La Gioconda, which is a nickname for the Mona Lisa of Leonardo da Vinci. Giaconda uses a stylised version of the Mona Lisa in its company logo. Giaconda's CEO is Mr Patrick McLean, a Canadian who was previously Senior Vice-President European Commercial Operations of the Montreal-based Axcan Pharma. Giaconda was a public company whose stock was traded on the Australian Stock Exchange under the stock code GIA. The company completed an initial public offering in September 2005, issuing 12 million shares at 50 Australian cents each. Thomas Borody currently owns around 70% of the stock. In August 2010 it sold the patents for Myoconda, Heliconda and Picoconda to RedHill Biopharma The company went into voluntary administration in February 2011. Products Giaconda worked on five products, all of which were given names ending in '-conda'. Myoconda, the company's lead product, is a combination of the antibiotics rifabutin, clarithromycin and clofazimine. The combination is envisaged as a new treatment for Crohn's disease. Myoconda was first devised by Thomas Borody around 1997. The product has its origins in Borody's view that Crohn's disease is caused by infection with the bacterium Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis, and that the disease can therefore be fought using drugs effective against the bacterium, such as those used in Myoconda. In 2000 Borody's organisation granted Pharmacia an option to license the Myoconda patent in return for that company agreeing to conduct a Phase III clinical trial. The results of a Phase II trial were published in 2002. The Phase III trial in 213 Crohn's patients was completed in September 2004 was results announced in 2005, however by this stage Pharmacia had merged with Pfizer and the latter company had decided not to exercise its Myoconda option. A non- binding letter of intent was signed in April 2006 with Forest Laboratories for the UK and Irish market. A second Phase III trial is planned, and Giaconda hoped to be able to launch the product in the United States in 2008. Hepaconda is a product for the treatment of Hepatitis C infection. The product, a combination of bezafibrate with chenodeoxycholic acid, was invented in 2001. Hepaconda is being developed as a 'rescue therapy' for Hepatitis C patients that have exhausted other treatment options. It is also envisaged that Hepaconda could be used to treat primary biliary cirrhosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Giaconda had initially envisaged using ursodeoxycholic acid as the bile acid in Hepaconda, but in 2006 the company shifted its attention to the use of chenodeoxycholic acid, having decided that its patent protection extended to all bile acid / fibrate combinations other than bezafibrate plus ursodoxycholic acid.

It is a part of the municipality of Buren, and lies about 9 km south-west of Veenendaal. Before 1999 the town was part of the municipality Lienden from 1818 till 1999. The houses are widely spread into a bowl form. The houses link to the townships De Ganzert and Eck en Wiel in the West. History In 1026 the town is known as Heiningen. Heiningen refers to Hangim, that means something like near the holy. Another possibility is that it's not Heiningen but Einingen, which could refer to the meadows of the town. Some people also think that Heiningen isn't the town of Ingen and that Ingen is named in records for the first time in the 14th age. The name could then come from Ingeborg, a god of the Vikings, or from the family Ingenhe from the 13th age. Limes The limes was the border of the Roman Empire. The limes was a connection between the Castella (forts) of the northern part of the Roman Empire. It was used as a highway to move the legions between the forts along the border. Geographical research shows that Ingen lies next to this road. Location of the German Limes in connection with the present borders of states. thumb Church Already in 1248, the church of Ingen is named in a charter. Nowadays, the church is Dutch reformed. The church was dedicated to Saint Lambertus of Maastricht. The church had three altars in 1495. The history of the church is connected to the Commanderie van Sint Jan. The first record of the order is in 1317. The insignia of the order can be found on a pillar in the church. In the 15th age there has been a huge renovation. The church was partially destroyed in the 17th age. Also in the 19th age the church had some problems. In the 1990s the church was renovated extensively again. In the church stands a baptismal font from the 12th age. Ferry The town is built next to the river Neder-Rijn, that is a separation of the river Rijn. In 1486 there already was a pedestrian ferry, to make transport across the river more easy. King William I of the Netherlands gave the owners permission to upgrade the pedestrian ferry to a pontoon ferry in 1821. The ferry and the ferryboat were then known as Ingensche Veer. The ferry line is still there today and has a new (2003) ferryboat in service called Geldersweert. The name Geldersweert excitinghistory.com refers to a castle that stood west of the ferry in a floodplain. The ferry had always been property of noble families, until 1912. The last noble owner was Anne Willen Jacob Joost Baron van Nagell, who inter alia was a chamberlain of King William III of the Netherlands. He sold the ferry to his exploitant, Frans Spies. This family still owns the ferry nowadays. =WWII= During WWII, the family Spies had to evacuate from the ferry house, in September 1944. The Germans manned the ferry, and the citizens weren't allowed to cross the Rhine any more. The Germans even used the old ferryboat a little further upwards the Rhine and placed it between Elst and Rhenen. They also placed 30 pieces of anti- aircraft. The Germans called the ferry house 'the Haunted House' during the war, because the ferry and the house were attacked three times a day by British fighter-bombers, but neither was ever hit. A few weeks before the liberation, the Allies also began bombarding from Ede, what resulted in a grenade that came into the facade and the roof of the ferry house. The old ferryboat was hit by a V1. World War II During World War II, Ingen didn't really see or feel the violence of the war even though it lies very close to the Grebbeberg. The Grebbeberg is a 50.2-metre high hill that was the central defensive point in 1940 for the centre and the west of the Netherlands. This hill was difficult to capture and a very good observation post for the troops. The Germans launched an assault on the Grebbeberg with heavy artillery but the Dutch soldiers remarkably defended the Grebbeberg with almost nothing to defend them with. No evacuation was possible for the inhabitants of Ingen because the area of Ingen, Lienden and Ommeren was right in the middle of the battle and the area could not be lost. But on 12 May 1940 the Dutch soldiers retreated to the Nieuwe Hollandse Waterlinie. And on 15 May, the Netherlands surrendered. This fast capitulation has spared Ingen of the German violence. The German soldiers went through Ingen but that was all. Grebbeberg, the Netherlands, seen from the south. And also in 1944, in the airborne operation on Arnhem, Ingen was of no strategical use. But on the night of 3 December 1944 the Germans used an old Dutch defence: they destroyed the dikes of the Rhine south of Arnhem. The whole Neder-Betuwe flooded. On 7 December, the water reached Ingen. Because of the water, the waterworks began to malfunction. The bad water caused scabies and typhus. The Germans fled to the northern shore of the Rhine. On 22 December the water began to flow back. But the Germans came back too. They took the last cattle and possessions the inhabitants had. In February, the water came back again. And again the Germans fled to the northern shore of the Rhine. This time the water stayed for four weeks. On 4 May, everything was over, the Germans capitulated in the Netherlands. In April 1946 Kinge van der Linden sang a song with the Metropole Orkest conducted by Dolf van der Linden. The song would gain national prominence. A part of the song translated into English goes like this: Once the Betuwe will be in bloom again, and will grow as one big, yellow grain.Chris van Esterik, Een jongen van het dorp - Honderd jaar Ingen, een dorp in de Betuwe, Bert Bakker, . pg. 133. Economy Ingen lies next to the river Neder-Rijn and is thereby a very fertile area. You can find a lot of orchards around Ingen. The horticulture is characteristic for Ingen. The first decade after World War II was the golden decade for Ingen. The government pushed the agriculture to a higher level because they wanted to compete on the world market with other countries. They mechanised the agriculture resulting in a higher production. But where other farms in the Netherlands became bigger 'companies', in the Betuwe the number of farmers with between 1 hectare (approximately 2.5 acres) and 5 hectares (approximately 12.4 acres) has risen to around 96 percent. The inhabitants had a good time too: in 1950 0.9 litres of beer per capita was consumed and in 1960 23.9 litres. Population In 2001, the town of Ingen had 758 inhabitants. The built-up area of the town was 0.15 km2, and contained 266 residences. The statistical area \\"Ingen\\", which also can include the peripheral parts of the village, as well as the surrounding countryside, has a population of around 1010.

Live food is commonly used as feed for a variety of species of exotic pets and zoo animals, ranging from alligators to various snakes, frogs and lizards, but also including other, non-reptile, non-amphibian carnivores and omnivores (for instance, skunks, which are omnivorous mammals, can technically be fed a limited amount of live food, though this is not known to be a common practice). Common live food ranges from crickets (used as an inexpensive form of feed for carnivorous and omnivorous reptiles such as bearded dragons and commonly available in pet stores for this reason), waxworms, mealworms and to a lesser extent cockroaches and locusts, to small birds and mammals such as mice or chickens. Varieties Live foods commonly available are crickets (Gryllus assimilis, Gryllus bimaculatus, Gryllodes sigillatus and Acheta domesticus commonly), waxworms (Galleria mellonella), mealworms (Tenebrio molitor), superworms (Zophobas morio) and locusts (a number of species are seen commonly). There are however many more species used such as butter worms, calci worms (Hermetia illucens), buffalo worms, bean weevils, phoenix worms, sun beetle grubs (Pachnoda marginata), earthworms, a variety of cockroach species (Blatta lateralis and Blaptica dubia commonly) , silkworms and more. Insect species are most commonly used to feed small reptiles and amphibians. Another common form of live food, most commonly used to feed snakes, is small rodents. The most commonly known small rodent used for live food is likely the mouse; many pet stores which carry snakes or cater to snake owners also carry \\"feeder mice\\" for this reason (see Fancy mouse). It is also common to feed reptiles freshly killed or frozen/thawed rodents as most reptiles will readily accept them. Creatures that are the most common choices for live foods, ranging from feeder mice to crickets and mealworms, generally are bred and raised in captivity themselves, and can often be found both through local pet stores and from wholesalers or \\"farms\\" that breed them specifically for live food sales. Animals commonly fed live food Animals that are commonly fed live food include bearded dragons,https://buddygenius.com/bearded-dragon-eat/ leopard geckos and other lizards, various types of snake, turtles, and carnivorous fish, though other animals, such as skunks (which are sometimes kept as pets), being omnivorous, can also eat some live food, though it is unknown how common this is in practice.

They migrated from Mewar due to internal strife. At that time, Maharaja Yashwantrao Holkar, who was a strong nationalist, decided to drive the British out of India. After successfully keeping the British out of his state, he built 200 cannons at a factory in Bhanpur. He gathered an army of 1 lakh (100,000) soldiers to attack Calcutta. The stress of the work and the death of his nephews, Khanderao Holkar II on 3 February 1806 at Shahapura, and Kashirao Holkar in 1808 at Bijagad, led to his sudden death in Mandsaur on 28 October 1811 at the age of 35. A Chhatri was constructed on the site of death of Maharaja Yashwantrao Holkar in Bhanpura, completed in 1841. This Chhatri houses a marble statue of Maharaja Yashwantrao Holkar.

The surface of the paintings is uneven in colour and texture. The colour of the paintings, which is mostly red and ochre, comes in varying shades, some bright, others a faded maroon and in rare instances, white and black. The subjects of paintings are human beings and animals including elephants, bison, tigers, leopards, monkeys, snakes, birds, rhinos, deer, water animals, foxes, cows, bullocks and camels. In several cases, daily lives have been depicted, such as herding, hunting, axe wielding, riding cattle, women performing chores, and other pastoral arts. The people, usually men, are sometimes depicted as stick figures, and sometimes using two triangles linked by straight lines, with or without clothes. In January 2007, the Rock Art Society of India (RASI) described it as the \\"longest chain of rock arts in the world\\". According to them, the earliest carvings are mostly of animals.

History Bhanvad is named after Jethwa ruler Rana Bhanji Jetva of Ghumli, who founded this place, when the Ghumli was sacked in 1313 AD. It was made a fortified town after the conquest of the country by the Jam of Nawanagar State. Ghumli which was once the capital of Jethwa dynasty and at present is an archeological site of interest is located some 6 km from Bhanvad.

Places of interest left There is an old temple of Bhannath Mahadev in Bhanvad. There is a small river called the Bhanvadi which flows near the town of Bhanvad. It joins the Vartu river about a mile further on near the shrine of the Indreshvar Mahadev. =Bhutvad= To the south of the town there is an old banian tree called the Bhut-vad or Ghost's banian, the legend about which is as follows. When Bhan Jethva ruled at Ghumli he had a flower garden on the present site of Ghumli which was called the Bhanvadi whence in after-times the name Bhanvad. This garden was entrusted to the charge of a Kathi named Mangro who was a great favourite of Bhan Jethva's. Mangro's reputation was so great that no raiders or freebooters dared to trouble the Jethva dominions. Mangro was a devotee of the Harsad Mata at Miyani. During his absence a Kathi free booter named Vala Uga came and carried off the Ghumli cattle. Bhan Jethva pursued the robbers and overtook them at Nared situated on the banks of the Hiran river in the Gir. Here they had encamped with the Ghumli cattle. Bhan Jethva camped close by and shortly afterwards challenged them to settle the matter by a combat between two champions one from either side. If the Ghumli champion were victorious the cattle were to be restored, but if he were defeated they were to be retained by the robbers. The robbers assented to this proposal. Now it so happened that there lived a Vaniya maiden named Padmavati at the village of Patan in the Alech hills who had heard much of the exploits of Mangro, so much so that she fell in love with him without having ever seen him, and was wont to visit daily a temple of Shiv near the village and implore the god to give her Mangro as a husband. When Mangro heard at Miyani of the capture of the Ghumli cattle and the departure of Bhan Jethva in pursuit, he at once mounted and set off with 120 horsemen to follow him. When they reached Patan they halted to rest their horses, and Mangro himself alighted at the temple. Here the maiden repairing for her daily worship at the temple met him, and struck with his beauty asked him who he was. He replied, ' I am Mangro, the Kathi of Bhan Jethva,' On hearing his name, she confessed her love for him and told him that she had since a long time been beseeing the god to grant him to her as a husband. Now she had seen him she besought him to accept her as a wife. Mangro, who had fallen in love with her the moment he saw her, promised to espouse her on his return. Thus saying he hastened on till he joined Bhan Jethva and accepted the office of Ghumli champion. But his heart was so soft from the love of Padmavati that he did not fight with his accustomed vigour, and was slain by the foe. Now though heroes who fall in battle never become ghosts, yet Mangro, whose heart was enslaved with love for the fair Padmavati, became one, and he specially haunted the banian tree at Nared where he was killed and the banian tree at Bhanvad. When Padmavati heard of Mangro's death she permitted her parents to betroth her in marriage to the son of a wealthy merchant of Una. When the marriage procession left Una for Patan for the marriage of Padmavati, they stopped at night under the Nared banian tree. Now, Arshi, uncle of Mangro, was the chief man of the procession, and when sleeping at night he was awoke by the tears of Mangro dropping on him. Then he addressed him and asked him how he fared. Mangro told him that he had become a ghost for love of Padmavati, and requested Arshi to take him with the bridal procession. To this Arshi agreed on condition that he consented to return whenever ordered. Mangro agreed and accompanied the procession in an invisible form and by his charms deformed the bridegroom and also smote him with leprosy. The Vaniyas in alarm consulted Arshi as to the reason, and he told them the story of Mangro. On this the Vaniyas agreed to Mangro's marriage with Padmavati on condition that he should restore her after the ceremony was concluded. This was agreed to, and Mangro assuming the appearance of a very handsome young man accompanied the procession to Patan. When it reached the village some of the villagers told Padmavati that her betrothed husband was deformed and a leper. She sat in a balcony to watch the procession pass and at once recognized her love Mangro. On seeing him she uttered this couplet:1 The Gujarati runs : Jane aviya javan, albela arai tani ; Ej ghodo ej edhaan, mile bhalyo Mangro. Padmavati then married Mangro the ghost, and then she accompanied them back to their village. When they reached the banian tree at Nared, Arshi told Mangro to remain there and restore the bride to her proper husband. Mangro did so, and promised Arshi that if he would establish his funeral monument at the Nared and Bhanvad banian trees, he would always assist him and others who should invoke his aid. Arshi erected the pillars, and he and others derived much aid in obtaining the performance of requests made to Mangro. Whenever marriages are performed in villages anywhere near these two banian trees, the bride and bridegroom are brought to the tree and there offer a coconut to Mangro and then the marriage ceremony is considered complete.

It helps to lower LDL cholesterol and triglyceride in the blood, and increase HDL. It was patented in 1971 and approved for medical use in 1978. Medical uses Bezafibrate improves markers of combined hyperlipidemia, effectively reducing LDL and triglycerides and improving HDL levels. The main effect on cardiovascular morbidity is in patients with the metabolic syndrome, the features of which are attenuated by bezafibrate. Studies show that in patients with impaired glucose tolerance, bezafibrate may delay progress to diabetes, and in those with insulin resistance it slowed progress in the HOMA severity marker. In addition, a prospective observational study of dyslipidemic patients with diabetes or hyperglycemia showed that bezafibrate significantly reduces haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) concentration as a function of baseline HbA1c levels, regardless of concurrent use of antidiabetic drugs. Side-effects The main toxicity is hepatic (abnormal liver enzymes); myopathy and on rare occasions rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Other uses The Australian biotech company Giaconda combines bezafibrate with chenodeoxycholic acid in an anti-hepatitis C drug combination called Hepaconda. Bezafibrate has been shown to reduce tau protein hyperphosphorylation and other signs of tauopathy in transgenic mice having human tau mutation. The combination of a cholesterol- lowering drug, bezafibrate, and a contraceptive steroid, medroxyprogesterone acetate, could be an effective, non-toxic treatment for a range of cancers, researchers at the University of Birmingham have found. Mode of action Like the other fibrates, bezafibrate is an agonist of PPARŒ±; some studies suggest it may have some activity on PPARŒ≥ and PPARŒ¥ as well. Synthesis Further evidence that substantial bulk tolerance is available in the para position is given by the lipid lowering agent bezafibrate. Bezafibrate synthesis: E. Witte et al., ; eidem, (both 1973 to Boehringer, Mann.). The p-chlorobenzamide of tyramine undergoes a Williamson ether synthesis with ethyl 2-bromo-2-methylpropionate to complete the synthesis.

He also worked on non-associative algebraic systems, such as loops, and used computer software, such as the Otter theorem prover, to derive theorems in these areas. Personal life Kunen was born in New York City in 1943 and died in 2020. He lived in Madison, Wisconsin, with his wife Anne, with whom he had two sons, Isaac and Adam. Education Kunen completed his undergraduate degree at the California Institute of Technology and received his Ph.D. in 1968 from Stanford University, where he was supervised by Dana Scott. Career and research Kunen showed that if there exists a nontrivial elementary embedding j : L ‚Üí L of the constructible universe, then 0# exists. He proved the consistency of a normal, \\\\aleph_2-saturated ideal on \\\\aleph_1 from the consistency of the existence of a huge cardinal. He introduced the method of iterated ultrapowers, with which he proved that if \\\\kappa is a measurable cardinal with 2^\\\\kappa>\\\\kappa^+ or \\\\kappa is a strongly compact cardinal then there is an inner model of set theory with \\\\kappa many measurable cardinals. He proved Kunen's inconsistency theorem showing the impossibility of a nontrivial elementary embedding V\\\\to V, which had been suggested as a large cardinal assumption (a Reinhardt cardinal). Away from the area of large cardinals, Kunen is known for intricate forcing and combinatorial constructions. He proved that it is consistent that Martin's axiom first fails at a singular cardinal and constructed under the continuum hypothesis a compact L-space supporting a nonseparable measure. He also showed that P(\\\\omega)/Fin has no increasing chain of length \\\\omega_2 in the standard Cohen model where the continuum is \\\\aleph_2.

It is similar to bovine parvovirus in its protein structure and DNA. A virus causing respiratory disease in humans has been called human bocavirus due to its similarity to these viruses. Canine minute virus was originally discovered in Germany in 1967 in military dogs, although it was originally thought to not cause disease. Dogs and puppies are infected orally, and the virus is spread transplacentally to the fetuses. Symptoms are seen most commonly between the ages of one to three weeks and include severe diarrhea, difficulty breathing, and anorexia. In severe cases, illness can be fatal. In experimental infections, the virus is spread transplacentally when the dam is infected between 25 and 30 days of gestation and can result in abortion. When the dam is infected between 30 and 35 days, the puppies were sometimes born with myocarditis and anasarca. Pathological lesions in fetuses in experimental infections were found in the lung and small intestine. Virology The genome is 5.4 kilobases in length. The termini are palindromic. There is a single P6 promoter which through the mechanism of alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation two nonstructural proteins (NS1 and NP1) and two capsid proteins (VP1 and VP2) are transcribed. The NS1 protein is indispensable for genome replication. The NP1 protein, unique to the Bocaparvovirus genus, appears to be critical for optimal viral replication, as the NP1 knockout mutant of MVC suffers from severe impairment of replication.

The species was first described by Cajetan Felder in 1868. Description It closely resembles Anthene emolus. In both sexes however, but especially in the male, the forewing is distinctly narrower and more acute at apex and the hindwing more acutely angulated at the tornus. In markings on the upperside the two forms are closely alike; on the underside they differ as follows: Ground colour similar but a shade darker. Forewing: the transverse discal band dislocated below vein 3 and shifted inwards so that the short band on the discocellulars and the anterior portion of the discal band form the two branches, the lower portion of the discal band the stem, of a rough Y-shaped figure. Hindwing: a large black or dark brown white-encircled spot touching vein 7 near its base (in A. emolus there is never any trace of such spot). The discal and terminal transverse bands with their pale or white edgings much more broken, irregular and confused.

The hybridization of these species prevents healthy males from forming, whereas males exist in both parent species (see Sexual differentiation). Parthenogenesis allows the resulting all-female population to reproduce and thus evolve into a unique species capable of reproduction. This combination of interspecific hybridization and parthenogenesis exists as a reproductive strategy in several species of whiptail lizard within the genus Aspidoscelis to which the New Mexico whiptail belongs.  Description  The New Mexico whiptail grows from in length, and is typically overall brown or black in color with seven pale yellow stripes from head to tail. Light colored spots often occur between the stripes. They have a white or pale blue underside, with a blue or blue-green colored throat.

They are found in a wide variety of semi-arid habitats, including grassland, rocky areas, shrubland, or mountainside woodlands. Reproduction occurs through parthenogenesis, with up to four unfertilized eggs being laid in mid summer, and hatching approximately eight weeks later. The New Mexico whiptail lizard is a crossbreed of a western whiptail, which lives in the desert, and the little striped whiptail, which favours grasslands. The lizard is a female-only species that reproduces by producing an egg through parthenogenesis. The whiptail engages in mating behavior with other females of its own species, giving rise to the common nickname \\"lesbian lizards\\". A common theory is that this behavior stimulates ovulation, as those that do not \\"mate\\" do not lay eggs.

Breeding takes place in the late spring, and clutches of 2 to 4 eggs are laid from May to July and hatch approximately six weeks later. The whiptail species eat crickets and other insects that live in Arizona. They are very fast in speed and quick to dive under a cactus if necessary.  Subspecies  There are eight recognized subspecies of Cnemidophorus inornatus: *Aspidoscelis inornatus chihuahuae (Wright & Lowe, 1993) *Aspidoscelis inornatus cienegae (Wright & Lowe, 1993) *Aspidoscelis inornatus heptagrammus (Axtell, 1961) - Trans-Pecos striped whiptail *Aspidoscelis inornatus juniperus (Wright & Lowe, 1993) - woodland striped whiptail *Aspidoscelis inornatus llanuras (Wright & Lowe, 1993) *Aspidoscelis inornatus inornatus (Baird, 1859) *Aspidoscelis inornatus octolineatus (Baird, 1858) *Aspidoscelis inornatus paululus (Williams, 1968)  References  ;Notes Herps of Texas: Cnemidophorus inornatus heptagrammus Aspidoscelis Fauna of the Southwestern United States Fauna of Northeastern Mexico Reptiles of the United States Reptiles of Mexico Reptiles described in 1859 Taxa named by Spencer Fullerton Baird ","title":"Little striped whiptail"},{"id":"5709590","text":"Bhati is a census town in South district in the state of Delhi, India.

Golden Ice Axes are awarded for achievements in the previous year. It is considered mountaineering's highest honor, and is considered to be the \\"Oscars\\" of mountaineering and climbing. Nominations are selected by GHM and Montagnes, and the award is chosen by a jury consisting of Guy Chaumereuil (the chief editor of Montagnes when the award was inaugurated), (until 1998) Jean-Claude Marmier (president of GHM when the award was inaugurated), the current president of GHM, the current editor of Montagnes, the previous year's winners and three members invited by GHM, one of whom becomes the president of the jury. The criteria for the award are as follows (translated from French): > The selection of potential laureates, as well as the conditions of awarding > the trophy obey a strict ethic, which is in line with the founding values of > the GHM. High technical level and commitment certainly constitute the > principal criteria to which the GHM members feel so attached.

URL accessed > June 25, 2006. Controversy has surrounded the award, due to the non-quantifiable nature of climbing accomplishments, and the varying interpretations of 'alpinism' and 'respect for the mountains.' Controversy has been magnified when the award recipient completed the climb in 'heavy' style, spending large amounts of time on the ascent and leaving gear behind, as in the cases of the 1997 and 2005 awards. In 2005 Ian Parnell withdrew his nomination, as did Alessandro Beltrami, Rolando Garibotti and Ermanno Salvaterra in 2006 for what might be the first ascent of the north face of Cerro Torre, and in 2008 during the selection process Garibotti asked the jury not to take into consideration the Torre Traverse first ascent he completed with Colin Haley. Marko Prezelj rejected the award in 2007 on stage to express his opposition for competition in alpinism. Marmier left the jury in 1998 explaining that \\"the decision of the jury has been a real disaster.\\" 2020 award The 2020 Piolet d'Or will be awarded in September 2020 during the Review of Mountain Films named after Andrzej Zawada in LƒÖdek-Zdr√≥j, Poland. *Catherine Destivelle will be presented with the 12th Lifetime Achievement award. 2019 award The 2019 Piolet d'Or was awarded in September 2019 during the Review of Mountain Films named after Andrzej Zawada in LƒÖdek-Zdr√≥j, Poland.

Home of the comics publisher Dupuis, as many popular creators of Franco-Belgian comics were based in Marcinelle the town has given name to the famous drawing style known as the Marcinelle school. Marcinelle is also the place where serial killer Marc Dutroux lived, before his arrest. History =Mining accident of Marcinelle= On the morning of August 8, 1956, a fire in the mines of Marcinelle resulted in 262 casualties. At the time of the incident, 274 people were working in the colliery Bois du Cazier, also known as Puits Saint- Charles.Description of the mine A mining wagon incorrectly positioned in the elevator cage struck an oil pipe and electrical cables when the elevator started moving. This caused a fire, which trapped the miners working in the galleries below. Of the 274 people working on that morning, only twelve survived. Most of the victims were immigrants. Among the victims, there were 136 Italians, 95 Belgians, eight Poles, six Greeks, five Germans, five Frenchmen, three Hungarians, one Englishman, one Dutchman, one Russian and one Ukrainian.Emporis News Rescue operations continued until August 23 when the final verdict came from the mouth of a rescuer: \\"Tutti cadaveri!\\" (All corpses).Le Bois du Cazier August 8, 1956 site The incident prompted Italy to demand better working conditions for the Italian guest workers in Belgium.

By the time of James Cook's Endeavour, the essentials of what today we would call a research ship are clearly apparent. In 1766, the Royal Society hired Cook to travel to the Pacific Ocean to observe and record the transit of Venus across the Sun. The Endeavour was a sturdy boat, well designed and equipped for the ordeals she would face, and fitted out with facilities for her research personnel, Joseph Banks. And, as is common with contemporary research vessels, Endeavour carried out more than one kind of research, including comprehensive hydrographic survey work. Some other notable early research vessels were HMS Beagle, RV Calypso, HMS Challenger, and the Endurance and Terra Nova. The race to the poles =19th century= Late 18th-century French project for modification of a frigate for polar exploration. The ram-looking device is supposed to protect the ship from the pressure of the ice. Fram in Antarctica in Roald Amundsen's expedition. Belgica anchored at Mount William. At the end of the 19th century there was intense international interest in exploring the North and South Poles. The search operations for the lost Franklin expedition were barely forgotten as Russia, Great Britain, Germany and Sweden set new scientific tasks for the Arctic Ocean. In 1868, the Swedish ship Sofia carried out temperature measurements and oceanographic observation in the sea area around Svalbard. During this year the Greenland, built in Norway, operated in the same area under the German command of Carl Koldeway. In 1868 to 1869, the ship owner A. Rosenthal gave scientists the opportunity to come aboard on his whaling trips and by 1869, the ship Germania, which was escorted by the Hansa and led the Second German North Polar Expedition, was built. The Germania returned safely from the expedition and was used later for further research. The Hansa, in contrast, was crushed by the ice and sunk. In 1874, the Austrian-Hungarian Tegetthoff as well as the American schooner Polaris under the command of Captain Hull met the same fate. The Royal Navy ships Alert and Discovery of the British Arctic Expedition of 1875-76 were more successful. In 1875 they left Portsmouth in order to cross the Arctic Ocean and reach as close as possible to the pole. Although they did not reach the pole itself they brought plenty of precious observations back. During these years, Adolf Erik Nordenski√∂ld's discovery of the Northeast Passage and first circumnavigation of Eurasia during the Vega expedition outstood all other expeditions. Fridtjof Nansen's famous Fram took deep-sea soundings and carried out hydrographical, meteorological and magnetic surveys throughout the polar basin. In 1884, a press item stating that the American Jeanette had sunk near the Siberian coast three years before inspired Fridtjof Nansen. The Captain of this ship, lieutenant George Washington de Long, assumed that currents existed floating ships deep into the polar ice. Three years after the loss of the Jeanette and de Long's death, some items of equipment and few sou'wester pants were found on the southwestern Greenland coast. When Nansen heard about that there was only one possible explanation for him: These pieces had drifted surrounded by ice via the polar basin and along the East coast of Greenland until they ended up in Julianehab. The driftwood used by the Inuit was even more enlightening for Nansen. It could only derive from the areas of the Siberian rivers that flowed into the Arctic Ocean. This hazarded a guess that there was a current which floated from somewhere between the pole and Franz Josef Land through the Arctic Ocean to the East coast of Greenland. After that, Nansen planned to freeze a ship into ice and to let it float. Unlike other explorers, Nansen supposed that a well-constructed ship would take him to the North Pole safely. As a scientist, he wanted to reach the Pole as well as to reconnoiter the sea area. The success of the expedition depended on the ship's construction, especially its resistance against ice pressure. Indeed, neither the Fram nor Nansen, who impatiently left his ship and ventured towards the pole on foot, achieved their goal but Nansen's theory about the currents was proved correct. While Nansen was returning from the ice of the Arctic Ocean, his countryman Roald Amundsen set off to the Antarctic. Aboard the Belgica Amundsen accompanied the Belgian Antarctic Expedition as a steersman. For this adventure Adrien de Gerlache purchased the whale catcher Patria for 70,000 francs, overhauled the engine, arranged additional cabins, installed a laboratory and renamed the ship Belgica. Between 1887 and 1899, biological and physical observations were carried out to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula and to the south of Peter I Island. The Belgica was the first ship that overwintered in the Antarctic. An international research team was aboard; later at the evaluation over 80 scientists participated. In 1895 Georg Neumayer, director of the Hamburg naval observatory, launched the slogan \\"off to the South Pole\\" at the sixth international geographic congress. Last but not least, motivated by reports of the Norwegian Carsten Borchgrevink, who was the first person on the new continent, the congress declared the exploration of the Antarctica the urgent task for the following years.

Germany built the expedition ship Gauss for 1.5 million marks at the Howaldtswerke in Kiel. On the model of the Fram, the Gauss, which weighed 1,442 tonnes (1,419 long tons) and was long, had a round hulk in order to withstand the ice pressure. The Gauss had three masts and one auxiliary engine of 275 horsepower (205 kW). With a 60-strong crew, it could operate for almost three years without any help. From 1901 until 1903, Erich von Drygalski led the German Antarctic expedition and carried out extensive studies mainly in the southern part of the Indian Ocean. The Swedish expedition under the command of Otto Nordenskj√∂ld used the old Antarctic weighing only 353 tonnes, which had already been used by Borchgrevink in 1895. The expedition intending to overwinter at the Antarctic Peninsula was ill-starred from the beginning. In 1902, the Antarctic sank. Fortunately, the Argentine gunboat Uruguay rescued all crewmembers. Also Great Britain prompted Dundee Shipbuilders to build a ship for Robert Falcon Scott's expedition. The Discovery weighed 1620 tonnes, was long and had an auxiliary motor of 450 horsepower. Nevertheless, during the research the ship froze in. Only the relief ship Morning, sent by the British Admiralty, was able to free the Discovery and with Terra Nova escorted the Discovery back home. The reunion with the Antarctic ice was undertaken by a Scottish expedition led by the naturalist William Speirs Bruce. Bruce had worked with the whale catchers Balaena and Active in the Southern Ocean in 1892 to 1893. He hoped that he could acquire the field-tested Balaena but found the ship too expensive, buying instead the Norwegian whale catcher Hekla for ¬£2,620, a ship that had sailed under the Danish flag along Greenland's coast in 1891 and 1892. For another ¬£8,000 he had the ship repaired and provided it with a new engine. Under the new name Scotia, this ship completed its way into the Southern Ocean and was very successful thanks to dredging and trawl catches at great depth in the Weddell Sea and off the coast. At that point the French vessel Fran√ßais, a three-master arrived at the Antarctic horizon. The French doctor and naturalist Jean-Baptiste Charcot was aboard. After his return from the ice he sold the Fran√ßais but was not able to forget the Antarctic. In 1908 he purchased another three-master, the Pourquoi Pas, with which he worked successfully in the Southern Ocean. Later the northern polar waters sparked the Frenchman's interest and in 1928 he participated in the rescue mission for Amundsen. Sir Ernest Shackleton, a member of the \\"Discovery-Expedition\\" of 1901, returned with the forty-year-old Nimrod back into the Antarctic in order to march to the South Pole but had to give up just 180 km before his goal. Shackleton had at first tried to purchase the whale catcher Bj√∏rn built at the Ris√∏r shipyard in Lindst√∏l. Since he couldn't raise the wind, he conceded this ship to Wilhelm Filchner's second German Antarctic expedition. Filchner refurbished the ship at the Blohm & Voss dockyard and renamed it Deutschland. There was enough room for thirty-four crewmembers, while single cabins were available for scientists and mates. In addition, a geologist, a meteorologist, an oceanographer and a zoologist shared a laboratory. The expedition, which visited the Southern Ocean between 1911 and 1912, made substantial contributions about the physical and chemical conditions in the western part of the southern Atlantic Ocean and the Weddell Sea. The Japanese first arrived in the Southern Ocean in 1911. Ensign Nobu Shirase explored with the Kainan Maru the eastern part of the Ross Ice Shelf. The years between 1910 until 1912 were characterized by the \\"great race\\" of Amundsen and Scott. While Scott travelled in the twenty-six-year-old Terra Nova, which had escorted him out of the ice in 1903, Roald Amundsen borrowed the reliable Fram for his South Pole expedition. During the dramatic race, Australia unobtrusively sent its first expedition ship, the Aurora, into the Antarctic under Douglas Mawson. An air-tractor, the first airplane in the region, was aboard but it proved to be useless. The failed attempt to cross Antarctica, for which Shackleton used the Endurance and Mawson's Aurora, was one of the last Antarctic expeditions before the outbreak of the First World War.  Between the world wars  After the war, Shackleton was one of the first to reengage in polar exploration. For a new Arctic expedition, he bought the Foca I which was designed in Norway and specified for polar areas. Organizational difficulties were encountered and Shackleton needed to change his plans and set course for the Southern Ocean. He did not complete the journey but died on the Quest at the beginning of his trip. His longtime comrade-in-arms Frank Wild assumed the leadership and advanced as far as the South Sandwich Islands until pack ice induced him to turn around and make for home. Later, the ship resumed its original role as a sealer. In 1930 to 1931 H. G. Watkins deployed the Quest for the British Air Route expedition, surveyed the eastern coast of Greenland in search of a site for an air base. The winner of the race, Roald Amundsen, made his way to the Arctic Ocean, his actual field of interest. In the following years between 1918 and 1922, he attempted to repeat Nansen's enterprise without success. After the First World War interrupted oceanographic research, international scientific activities started anew in 1920. The invention of the echo sounder in 1912 reached a new significance for the international marine research. Henceforth, it was possible to measure the distance to the seabed by sending acoustic signals instead of using wires and weights. Warships used echo sounders during the First World War. In 1922, the American destroyer Stewart took the first echo profile over the North Atlantic and one year later, the sonic logging between San Francisco and San Diego was published. Between 1929 and 1934 the USS Ramapo took about thirty profiles of the northern Pacific Ocean. In 1927, the German cruiser Emden was able to carry out a series of soundings of the ocean trench to the east of the Philippines. The German ship Meteor was the first to use the echo sounder for scientific purposes in the 1920s on the German Meteor expedition. For the first time an ocean, the Atlantic, was systematically mapped. The Meteor crossed the South Atlantic from the ice line to 20¬∞ N on fourteen mapping ways. With 67,000 echo soundings, cartographers were able to produce a modern depth chart. Other geomagnetic and oceanographic mapping expeditions followed e.g. the American research ship Carnegie in the Pacific Ocean from 1928 to 1929, the detailed reconnaissance in Indonesia by the Dutch Willebrord Snellius, the exploration of the waters around the Antarctic by the British and Discovery II and the expedition of the American schooner Atlantis that sailed from the West Atlantic to the Gulf of Mexico between 1932 and 1938. Also the Scandinavian countries continued their activities at the end of the 1920s. Danish scientists devoted themselves to research in marine biology. The oceanographic Dana Expedition, led by Johannes Schmidt and financed by the Carlsberg Foundation, was the most important Danish marine expedition. The treasured fish and plankton species belonged to the greatest collection of that time. The deceased John Murray had made a will stating that his invested inheritance would be used for an expedition as soon as enough capital would be accumulated. In 1931 was this the case and John Challenger Murray set work on realizing his father's wish. Since the envisaged research ships William Scoresby, Dana and George Bligh were inapplicable or unavailable respectively, the offer of the Egyptian government to take the \\"Mabahiss\\" was accepted. The Mabahiss left Alexandria on September 3, 1933 and returned on Mai 25, 1934. During this period she covered the Red Sea, Bay of Biscay, Indian Ocean, and the Gulf of Oman‚Äîmore than 22,000 nautical miles (41,000 km) whereas chemical, physical and biological assays were taken. The scientific leadership ran Seymour Sewell. In total, three British and two Egyptian scientists participated in this journey. In 1923, Japan sent the Manchiu Maru in the Indian and Pacific Ocean, and since 1927 the ships Shunpo Maru and Soyo Maru were on their way. From 1930 on the Shintoku Maru made annual trips to the Pacific Ocean for assays of the seawater. Eight years later, a new phase of the marine research began. As so far, the marine research continued but from now, different countries worked together on one expedition. The German Altair and the Norwegian Armauer Hansen performed a common measurement program within the scope of the international Gulf Stream expedition that shed light on the fluctuation of the Gulf Stream. For this international experiment the German Meteor, the Danish Dana, and the French air-base vessel Carimare delivered data. In the same year, unconventional ships began with marine research. Two flying boats, the Boreas and the Passat, equipped with aerial photography equipment were on board the ship Schwabenland. The application of this technology over Antarctica was revolutionary. Stereo photography was used. On the way back to Europe, the aircraft carrier conducted oceanographic, biological and meteorological observations and every fifteen to thirty minutes echo soundings were taken. The oceanographic researches during World War II were principally aligned with military questions. The study of underwater acoustic, which was significant for positioning submarines, and the study of waves and surf, which was important for the amphibious task force, dominated the marine research.  The postwar period  Albeit the big seafaring nations enlarged the postwar marine research, especially the United States strongly reengaged, other expeditions of two smaller countries were vitally important. The Swedish \\"Albatross\\" expedition of 1947/48 crossed eighteen times the equator and covered 45,000 nautical miles (83,000 km). Over 200 cores, fastened on a perpendicular, were dragged 1.5 km over the seabed. The second Danish \\"Galathea\\" expedition from 1950 to 1951 headed by Anton Bruun concentrated on studies of the life in the deep sea and succeeded in catching live animals from the bottom of the Philippine Trench at a depth of 10,190 m (33,430 ft), proving that life can exist in the deepest parts of the ocean. Another significant find of the expedition was the discovery of a \\"living fossil\\", the monoplacophoran Neopilina galathea, dredged from the bottom of the Mexican Gulf. Already in the 1930s, American scientist began to use seismic measuring methods in flat waters and during the war, physicist Maurice Ewing carried the first seismic refraction measurements out. The introduction of this geophysical method as well as palaeomagnetic researches (studying the Earth's magnetic field preserved in magnetic iron-bearing minerals), led to a reinvigoration of Alfred Wegener's continental drift theory and subsequent development of plate tectonics. After the Second World War, the number of missions escalated worldwide as one can read in the Newsletters of Cooperative Investigations of the Mediterranean from Monaco. For the period from 1950 to 1960, 110 expeditions are displayed for the Mediterranean area. =Increasing collaboration= At the beginning of the 1950s, a rethinking of the marine research set in and the international close work between several ships was remarkable. In line with the NOPAC enterprise, Canadian, American ships (Hugh M. Smith, Brown Bear, Ste. Teherse, Horizon, Black Douglas, Stranger, Spencer F. Baird) and the Japanese vessels (Oshoro Maru, Tenyo Maru, Kagoshima Maru, Satsuma, Umitaka Maru) took part in this endeavor. On a grand scale, common international research programs got its way during the international geophysical year (IGY) of 1957/58. For the exploration of deep-sea circulation and strong sea currents, sixty research ships out of forty nations were deployed. In cooperation of the research ships Crawford, Atlantis, Discovery II, Chain and the Argentine sounding vessel Capitan Canepa, fifteen profiles at intervals of eight latitudes between 48¬∞ N and 48¬∞ S were taken. Furthermore, twenty ships of twelve nations took part in the Cold Wall enterprise, which was another program of the IGY. The research was focused on the Cold Wall, which separates the warm, high-salt Gulf Stream and the cold, low-salt water masses of polar origin and stretches northwestwards from the Newfoundland banks to the Norwegian Sea. Later on, Germany also participated in the program with the Antorn Dohrn and the Gauss. This was Germany's first participation after World War II. For the first time, the Soviet Union, which had a fleet of twenty research ships and one research dive station, took part in an international project during the IGY. Moreover, the USSR commissioned the research ships (5700 t) and Michail Lomonosov (6000 t) and the icebreaker Ob. The IGY marked the beginning of a new exploration phase in the marine research characterized by international cooperation and synoptic researches. With the \\"Overflow\\" program, scientists tried to reconnoiter the overflow of the cold Arctic ground water over the submarine ridge between Iceland and the Faroe Islands. Nine research ships of five European countries took a stake in. This program was repeated at a larger scale: thirteen research ships of seven countries were on its way. Denmark appointed the Dana and the Jens Christian Svabo, Iceland the Bjarni S√¶mundson, Canada the Hudson, Norway the Helland Hansen, USSR the Boris Davydov and the Professor Zubov, Great Britain the Challenger, the Shackleton and the Explorer, West Germany the Meteor, the Walther Herwig, and the Meerkatze II. =Tropical meteorology= Between the years 1959 and 1965, forty research ships of 23 countries assayed the Indian Ocean together. This ocean, having an exceptional position because of the monsoons and being surrounded by developing countries, was the least known sea area. The abutters should have gotten an opportunity to start their own sea and fishing research programs. In 1958 the prelude was formed by the American ship Vema, other ships joined in between 1959 and 1960: Diamantina (Australia), Commandant Robert Giraud (France), Vitjaz (USSR), Argo, Requisite (USA) and the Umitaka Maru. West Germany followed with its Meteor in 1964/64. In the course of the longtime Global Atmospheric Research Programme (GARP), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) called for a global weather experiment by which the entire atmosphere and the ocean surface are supposed to be observed for the first time. More than fifty ships worked in the equatorial areas around the globe and collected oceanographic and meteorological measured data for an \\"inventory of the world weather\\". Especially the continuation of the works and questions became the most important task for the next years and decades. Besides these big international programs, the number of projects carried out by two or three countries increased. With increasing political and economical pressure, which resulted from thincreasingng raw material supply, more and more countries participated in marine research. =Chinese research ships= In the years between 1964 and 1975, China built forty research ships, including the Practice (1965) with a displacement of 3,167 tonnes (3,117 long tons), and the Xiang Yang Hong 5 (1972) (10,000 tonnes or 9.840 tons), which was China's first multipurpose research ship. After 1976, the situation for Chinese marine researchers improved and in 1984 Liu Zhengang from the national bureau for oceanography reported at a scientific Congress that at first research ships had been created by remodeling fishing boats, freighters or discarded ships of the navy. A typical ship had been the Jinxing during that time of 1969. In the 1970s, China had begun to build new ships such as the 10,000 t multipurpose ship Xiang Yang Hong 10. To cover the needed demands for oil discoveries, several geophysical ships had been built in China and in foreign countries. Since the development had continued, great importance had been attached to keep the ships on a well-equipped and technical level. According to Zhengang's statement, the research fleet had consisted of 165 units with 150,000 tonnes altogether. Thereunder had been more than fifty ships with a tonnage of 5,000, twenty-two ships with a tonnage from 1,000 to 5,000, twenty ships with a tonnage between 500 and 1,000 and only fifty ships had had less than 50. Primarily, these ships had been run by the national bureau for oceanography, department of oil, department of agriculture and by universities. During the southern summer of 1984/1985, the Xiang Yang Hong 10 and the J 121 had been the first Chinese research ships which had sailed to the Antarctic in order to build the research station \\"Great Wall\\". China had caught up with the marine research works of the 1970s and 1980s and had tried to get a voice in the future of Antarctica. Autonomous Vessels Autonomous oceanographic research vessel Mechanically and hydrodynamically, autonomous research platforms are similar to towed sonar \\"fish\\" and ROVs. Operationally, however, known autonomous vehicles were initially limited to rivers, lakes, and bays due to navigation and collision-avoidance issues. Thus, progress in surface vessels lagged behind both unmanned aerial vehicles and submarine-types, due to their simpler operating conditions. Nevertheless, advances in navigation, machine vision and other sensors, and processing have spread ASVs from highly advanced models to the undergraduate level.

Bestowed mainly on Hindus, the equivalent title for Muslim and Parsi subjects was Khan Bahadur. For Sikhs it was Sardar Bahadur. Those awarded the Rao Bahadur title were usually drawn from the lower rank of Rai Sahib, both of which were below the rank of Dewan Bahadur.

Early life Born in 1902, Mackenzie was the daughter of Sir Hugh Ross MacKenzie, a farmer and horse stud owner in Mangere, Auckland. After finishing secondary school, she began to train as a nurse, but did not accept discipline from the matrons who supervised trainee nursing activities. However, she discovered that she did have a flair for dressmaking, and opened Ninette Gowns in Vulcan Lane, Auckland. Her shop became highly successful, attracting a prosperous clientele from Auckland's more affluent suburbs. Brothel ownership Mackenzie embraced the sexual freedom of the 1920s, and soon found that there were other young women that wanted a private venue within which to pursue their relationships. In time, this branched out to female sex workers as well. Her father realised that Mackenzie would probably never marry, and bought her a series of properties in Ring Terrace, Ponsonby. When the United States entered World War II, New Zealand experienced an influx of American service personnel bound for the Pacific theatre of operations. She ensured regular medical examinations for the female sex workers who lived in her venue. She lived on- site in an apartment, and had an affair with a naval lieutenant, who failed to return from the war. While she was brought before the courts on the matter of \\"living off the proceeds of prostitution\\", this resulted in a hung jury twice, and she was not convicted thereafter. According to one witness, she was also solicitous about the spiritual welfare of her clients. When Flora died in 1982, her funeral was well-attended, for she had become a cherished civic figure, despite her occupational sideline. Ninette Gowns Ninette Gowns was a New Zealand clothing retailer that operated between the early 1920s and 1958, and was located on the corner of Vulcan Lane and Queen Street in Auckland. Along with Trilby Yates and Bobby Angus, it is considered one of the founders of fashion design in New Zealand. It was started by MacKenzie in the 1920s and specialized in wedding and evening garments. By the late 1930s there were around eight staff, including embroiders, steamers, cutters, sewers and an accountant. All of the garments were made onsite in an adjacent to the main salon. Bruce Papas completed a five-year apprenticeship at Ninette Gowns under the tutorship of Mackenzie. Mackenzie was \\"invested with a unique creative sensibility that filtered through every aspect of the enterprise\\" and the reputation of Ninette Gowns attracted affluent clientele from all over New Zealand. Mackenzie was insistent on using high quality fabrics and would post swatches of fabric and her designs to clients for approval. The finished garment would also be sent by post, often with the original design sketch included. Mackenzie closed Ninette Gowns around 1958.

Description A close relative of the bridled and sooty terns (with which it is sometimes confused), the spectacled tern is less common than the other members of its genus and it has been studied less. The three species, along with the Aleutian tern were recently split into a new genus Onychoprion from Sterna (Bridge et al., 2005). They resemble the sooty tern but with a grey back instead of a black one. Their breast and underparts are white, and they have a black eye line from the bill to the back of the head. Distribution and habitat The spectacled tern breeds on islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. At the northern end of its distribution it nests in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (with the largest population being Lisianski Island) and two small islets off Oahu, in the east as far as the Tuamotu Islands, with other colonies in the Society Islands, the Line Islands, Phoenix Islands, Mariana Islands and American Samoa. There are unconfirmed reports of breeding as far south as Fiji, and as far east as Easter Island. Little is known about the populations outside of Hawaii. Outside of the breeding season the species is partly migratory, with birds from the Hawaiian Islands flying south. It is thought that birds in other parts of the Pacific are also migratory, and will disperse as far as Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, and Easter Island.  References  * Bridge, E. S.; Jones, A.

The cathedral had burnt down during a riot; now Justinian would build an even more beautiful one. Inspiration (from the Latin inspirare, meaning \\"to breathe into\\") is an unconscious burst of creativity in a literary, musical, or other artistic endeavour. The concept has origins in both Hellenism and Hebraism. The Greeks believed that inspiration or \\"enthusiasm\\" came from the muses, as well as the gods Apollo and Dionysus. Similarly, in the Ancient Norse religions, inspiration derives from the gods, such as Odin. Inspiration is also a divine matter in Hebrew poetics. In the Book of Amos the prophet speaks of being overwhelmed by God's voice and compelled to speak. In Christianity, inspiration is a gift of the Holy Spirit. In the 18th century philosopher John Locke proposed a model of the human mind in which ideas associate or resonate with one another in the mind. In the 19th century, Romantic poets such as Coleridge and Shelley believed that inspiration came to a poet because the poet was attuned to the (divine or mystical) \\"winds\\" and because the soul of the poet was able to receive such visions. In the early 20th century, psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud believed himself to have located inspiration in the inner psyche of the artist. Psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung's theory of inspiration suggests that an artist is one who was attuned to racial memory, which encoded the archetypes of the human mind. The Marxist theory of art sees it as the expression of the friction between economic base and economic superstructural positions, or as an unaware dialog of competing ideologies, or as an exploitation of a \\"fissure\\" in the ruling class's ideology. In modern psychology inspiration is not frequently studied, but it is generally seen as an entirely internal process. History of the concepts =Ancient models of inspiration= In Greek thought, inspiration meant that the poet or artist would go into ecstasy or furor poeticus, the divine frenzy or poetic madness. He or she would be transported beyond his own mind and given the gods' or goddesses own thoughts to embody. Inspiration is prior to consciousness and outside of skill (ingenium in Latin). Technique and performance are independent of inspiration, and therefore it is possible for the non-poet to be inspired and for a poet or painter's skill to be insufficient to the inspiration. In Hebrew poetics, inspiration is similarly a divine matter. In the Book of Amos, 3:8 the prophet speaks of being overwhelmed by God's voice and compelled to speak. However, inspiration is also a matter of revelation for the prophets, and the two concepts are intermixed to some degree. Revelation is a conscious process, where the writer or painter is aware and interactive with the vision, while inspiration is involuntary and received without any complete understanding. In Christianity, inspiration is a gift of the Holy Spirit. Saint Paul said that all scripture is given by inspiration of God (2 Timothy) and the account of Pentecost records the Holy Spirit descending with the sound of a mighty wind. This understanding of \\"inspiration\\" is vital for those who maintain Biblical literalism, for the authors of the scriptures would, if possessed by the voice of God, not \\"filter\\" or interpose their personal visions onto the text. For church fathers like Saint Jerome, David was the perfect poet, for he best negotiated between the divine impulse and the human consciousness. In northern societies, such as Old Norse, inspiration was likewise associated with a gift of the gods. As with the Greek, Latin, and Romance literatures, Norse bards were inspired by a magical and divine state and then shaped the words with their conscious minds. Their training was an attempt to learn to shape forces beyond the human. In the Venerable Bede's account of C√¶dmon, the Christian and later Germanic traditions combine. C√¶dmon was a herder with no training or skill at verse. One night, he had a dream where Jesus asked him to sing. He then composed \\"C√¶dmon's Hymn\\", and from then on was a great poet. Inspiration in the story is the product of grace: it is unsought (though desired), uncontrolled, and irresistible, and the poet's performance involves his whole mind and body, but it is fundamentally a gift. =Renaissance revival of furor poeticus= The Greco-Latin doctrine of the divine origin of poetry was available to medieval authors through the writings of Horace (on Orpheus) and others, but it was the Latin translations and commentaries by the neo-platonic author Marsilio Ficino of Plato's dialogues Ion and (especially) Phaedrus at the end of the 15th century that led to a significant return of the conception of furor poeticus.Grahame Castor. Pl√©iade Poetics: A Study in Sixteenth- Century Thought and Terminology. Cambridge University Press: 1964, pp. 26‚Äì31. Ficino's commentaries explained how gods inspired the poets, and how this frenzy was subsequently transmitted to the poet's auditors through his rhapsodic poetry, allowing the listener to come into contact with the divine through a chain of inspiration. Ficino himself sought to experience ecstatic rapture in rhapsodic performances of Orphic-Platonic hymns accompanied by a lyre.Michael J. B. Allen. \\"Renaissance Neoplatonism.\\" The Cambridge History of Literary Criticism. Vol III: The Renaissance. Glyn P. Norton, ed. Cambridge U: 1999, pp. 436-438. . The doctrine was also an important part of the poetic program of the French Renaissance poets collectively referred to as La Pl√©iade (Pierre de Ronsard, Joachim du Bellay, etc.); a full theory of divine fury / enthusiasm was elaborated by Pontus de Tyard in his Solitaire Premier, ou Prose des Muses, et de la fureur po√©tique (Tyard classified four kinds of divine inspiration: (1) poetic fury, gift of the Muses; (2) knowledge of religious mysteries, through Bacchus; (3) prophecy and divination through Apollo; (4) inspiration brought on by Venus/Eros.) '' =Enlightenment and Romantic models= In the 18th century in England, nascent psychology competed with a renascent celebration of the mystical nature of inspiration. John Locke's model of the human mind suggested that ideas associate with one another and that a string in the mind can be struck by a resonant idea. Therefore, inspiration was a somewhat random but wholly natural association of ideas and sudden unison of thought. Additionally, Lockean psychology suggested that a natural sense or quality of mind allowed persons to see unity in perceptions and to discern differences in groups. This \\"fancy\\" and \\"wit,\\" as they were later called, were both natural and developed faculties that could account for greater or lesser insight and inspiration in poets and painters. The musical model was satirized, along with the afflatus, and \\"fancy\\" models of inspiration, by Jonathan Swift in A Tale of a Tub. Swift's narrator suggests that madness is contagious because it is a ringing note that strikes \\"chords\\" in the minds of followers and that the difference between an inmate of Bedlam and an emperor was what pitch the insane idea was. At the same time, he satirized \\"inspired\\" radical Protestant ministers who preached through \\"direct inspiration.\\" In his prefatory materials, he describes the ideal dissenter's pulpit as a barrel with a tube running from the minister's posterior to a set of bellows at the bottom, whereby the minister could be inflated to such an extent that he could shout out his inspiration to the congregation. Furthermore, Swift saw fancy as an antirational, mad quality, where, \\"once a man's fancy gets astride his reason, common sense is kick't out of doors.\\" The divergent theories of inspiration that Swift satirized would continue, side by side, through the 18th and 19th centuries. Edward Young's Conjectures on Original Composition was pivotal in the formulation of Romantic notions of inspiration. He said that genius is \\"the god within\\" the poet who provides the inspiration. Thus, Young agreed with psychologists who were locating inspiration within the personal mind (and significantly away from the realm either of the divine or demonic) and yet still positing a supernatural quality. Genius was an inexplicable, possibly spiritual and possibly external, font of inspiration. In Young's scheme, the genius was still somewhat external in its origin, but Romantic poets would soon locate its origin wholly within the poet. Romantic writers such as Ralph Waldo Emerson (The Poet), and Percy Bysshe Shelley saw inspiration in terms similar to the Greeks: it was a matter of madness and irrationality. Inspiration came because the poet tuned himself to the (divine or mystical) \\"winds\\" and because he was made in such a way as to receive such visions. Samuel Taylor Coleridge's accounts of inspiration were the most dramatic, and his The Eolian Harp was only the best of the many poems Romantics would write comparing poetry to a passive reception and natural channelling of the divine winds. The story he told about the composition of Kubla Khan has the poet reduced to the level of scribe. William Butler Yeats would later experiment and value automatic writing. Inspiration was evidence of genius, and genius was a thing that the poet could take pride in, even though he could not claim to have created it himself. =Modernist and modern concepts= Sigmund Freud and other later psychologists located inspiration in the inner psyche of the artist. The artist's inspiration came out of unresolved psychological conflict or childhood trauma. Further, inspiration could come directly from the unconscious. Like the Romantic genius theory and the revived notion of \\"poetic phrenzy,\\" Freud saw artists as fundamentally special, and fundamentally wounded. Because Freud situated inspiration in the unconscious mind, Surrealist artists sought out this form of inspiration by turning to dream diaries and automatic writing, the use of Ouija boards and found poetry to try to tap into what they saw as the true source of art. Carl Gustav Jung's theory of inspiration reiterated the other side of the Romantic notion of inspiration indirectly by suggesting that an artist is one who was attuned to something impersonal, something outside of the individual experience: racial memory. Materialist theories of inspiration again diverge between purely internal and purely external sources. Karl Marx did not treat the subject directly, but the Marxist theory of art sees it as the expression of the friction between economic base and economic superstructural positions, or as an unaware dialog of competing ideologies, or as an exploitation of a \\"fissure\\" in the ruling class's ideology. Therefore, where there have been fully Marxist schools of art, such as Soviet Realism, the \\"inspired\\" painter or poet was also the most class-conscious painter or poet, and \\"formalism\\" was explicitly rejected as decadent (e.g. Sergei Eisenstein's late films condemned as \\"formalist error\\"). Outside of state- sponsored Marxist schools, Marxism has retained its emphasis on the class consciousness of the inspired painter or poet, but it has made room for what Frederic Jameson called a \\"political unconscious\\" that might be present in the artwork. However, in each of these cases, inspiration comes from the artist being particularly attuned to receive the signals from an external crisis. In modern psychology, inspiration is not frequently studied, but it is generally seen as an entirely internal process. In each view, however, whether empiricist or mystical, inspiration is, by its nature, beyond control. An example of a modern study on inspiration is one that was conducted by Takeshi Okada and Kentaro Ishibashi, published in 2016 in the multidisciplinary journal, Cognitive Science. In this three-part study, groups of Japanese undergraduate art students were observed to determine whether copying or simply musing upon example artworks that served as their inspiration would increase their creative output. The results of the first and second experiment revealed that copying artwork enabled the students to produce creative drawings that were qualitatively different, but only when the example‚Äîthe inspiration‚Äîfeatured a style that was unfamiliar to the students. The third experiment revealed that only musing upon the unfamiliar inspiration produced the same effect as copying it. Okada and Ishibashi suggest that these unfamiliar examples were able to facilitate the creativity of the students because they challenged the students' perspectives on drawing. They admit, however, that it is unclear whether their results can be generalized to professional artists as well, but they cite examples of artists, namely Pablo Picasso and Vincent van Gogh, who extensively imitated the work of other artists, which might suggest that \\"imitation is an effective driver of creativity, even for experts.\\" See also * Afflatus, the Romantic concept of inspiration * Automatic writing * Divine spark * Epiphany (feeling) * Genius (literature), the development of the concept of the genius from daemon to innate gift * Glossolalia (or speaking in tongues) * Muses, the classical sources of inspiration References *Brogan, T.V.F. \\"Inspiration\\" in Alex Preminger and T.V.F.

Bhokardan has been identified by the modern historians as a capital city of an ancient Janapada Bhogavardhana. Etymology According to legends, the name Bhokardan is derived from the name of king Bhogvardhan or Bhagdnath, who ruled this city in ancient time. Local legends consider this to be a capital city of Bhoumasura, a mythological demon, who was killed by Hindu god Shri Krishna. History Bhokardan is situated on the bank of Kelana river. Bhokardan has been identified by the modern historians with the ancient city of Bhogavardhana. One of the earliest references of Bhokardan is found in Markandeya Purana, where it is described as a prosperous trading city in Dandakaranya area, located on the trade route from Ujjayini, in central India to Prathishthana, then capital city of Satavahanas. Similar, references were also found in various other ancient literature. In earlier period Bhokardan was a Janapada, which later got status of an independent region. Bhokardan was the third richest city in Satavahana period after Prathishthana and Ter. The inscription records at stupas of Bharhut and Sanchi, mention receiving donations from inhabitants of this city for their construction. There is a reference in an article from 593 AD that, the king of Mahishmati, Raja Shankargan, of Kalachuri dynasty, has donated some land to a Brahmin in Bhogvardan region. However, the history of this place in the Middle Ages is not known. In later period of Peshwas rule, this city came under control of the Nizam of Hyderabad. Bhokardan was part of Hyderabad State until its annexation into the Indian Union in 1948. In 1960, it became a part of newly form state of Maharashtra from bilingual Bombay state. The ruins of old fortification are still visible around the city; the old fort area now houses the Tehsil office. Excavation at Bhokardan: An ancient site comprising two mounds, about 70 ft high, was discovered by M. N. Deshpande near Bhokardan in 1958. Subsequently, a joint evacuation was carried away by a combined team of Nagpur University and Marathwada University, in 1973‚Äì74, during this evacuation two periods of occupation were identified: * Period I ** Period Ia - early Satavahana period ** Period Ib - late Satavahana period * Period II post Satavahana period. During the excavations, traces of foundations, brick walls, floors, post-holes, fallen roofs and a ring well were discovered. The artifacts found from the site included punch-marked coins, copper coins of the Satavahanas and the Kshatrapas; a few terracotta bullae with legends in Greek; coin moulds and seals. About 2000 beads made of terracotta, glass, shell and semi-precious stones were also found. A large number of terracotta, iron, copper and ivory objects were found from the site. The other important items found at site compromised: scores of human and animal figurines; ivory and shell bangles; terracotta ear ornaments; saddle querns with Buddhist symbols and burnt grains which compromised wheat, Jowar, gram, ber and rice. The Pompeii Lakshmi ivory statuette (1st century CE) found in the ruins of Pompeii in Italy is thought to have originated in Bhokardan.State Intervention and Popular Response: Western India in the Nineteenth Century, Mariam Dossal, Ruby Maloni, Popular Prakashan, 1999, p.46 However, the most exquisite of all the find was the lower half of an ivory female figurine, carved in the round with two female attendants. It is reminiscent of the ivory statue of Hindu goddess found at ancient Roman town-city Pompeii near modern Naples in the Italy, which was destroyed and buried under ash and pumice in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. Numbers of scholars have argued that the ivory statue of Pompeii had its origin at Bhokardan, which found its way either through ancient caravan based silk route or via ship based spice route to Pompeii in the first century AD. Similar ivory objects were also found at Ter. This statues serves as a testimonial of trade relationships of the ancient world. During Satavahanas' period Bhokardan was a center for ivory artifacts, which were traded for other items. After the decline of the Satavahanas, Bhokardan lost its importance as a major trade center, leading to its downfall. It seems to have been re-occupied only in medieval period. The ivory female statue and number of other artifacts which were found during excavation are now preserved and displayed at the history museum, of department of History & Ancient Indian Culture, of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University, Aurangabad.

Front sensors may be activated manually and deactivated automatically when the vehicle reaches a pre-determined speed ‚Äî to avoid subsequent nuisance warnings. As an ultrasonic systems relies on the reflection of sound waves, the system may not detect flat objects or object insufficiently large to reflect sound ‚Äî e.g., a narrow pole or a longitudinal object pointed directly at the vehicle or near an object. Objects with flat surfaces angled from the vertical may deflect return sound waves away from the sensors, hindering detection. Also soft object with strong sound absorption may have weaker detection, e.g. wool or moss. Electromagnetic systems The electromagnetic parking sensor (EPS) was re- invented and patented in 1992 by Mauro Del Signore. Electromagnetic sensors rely on the vehicle moving slowly and smoothly towards the object to be avoided. Once an obstacle is detected, the sensor continues to signal the presence of the obstacle even if the vehicle momentarily stops. If the vehicle then resumes moving backwards the alarm signal becomes louder as the obstacle is approached. Electromagnetic parking sensors are often sold as not requiring any holes to be drilled offering a unique design that discreetly mounts on the inner side of the bumper preserving the 'new factory look' of your vehicle.

In 1985, for example, exports and imports each accounted for only 4 percent of the Soviet gross national product. The Soviet Union maintained this low level because it could draw upon a large energy and raw material base, and because it historically had pursued a policy of self-sufficiency. Other foreign economic activity included economic aid programs, which primarily benefited the less developed Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) countries of Cuba, Mongolia, and Vietnam.Text used in this cited section originally came from: Soviet Union Country Study from the Library of Congress Country Studies project. The Soviet Union conducted the bulk of its foreign economic activities with communist countries, particularly those of Eastern Europe. In 1988 Soviet trade with socialist countries amounted to 62 percent of total Soviet foreign trade. Between 1965 and 1988, trade with the Third World made up a steady 10 to 15 percent of the Soviet Union's foreign trade. Trade with the industrialized West, especially the United States, fluctuated, influenced by political relations between East and West, as well as by the Soviet Union's short-term needs. In the 1970s, during the period of d√©tente, trade with the West gained in importance at the expense of trade with socialist countries. In the early and mid-1980s, when relations between the superpowers were poor, however, Soviet trade with the West decreased in favor of increased integration with Eastern Europe. The manner in which the Soviet Union transacted trade varied from one trade partner to another. Soviet trade with the Western industrialized countries, except Finland, and most Third World countries was conducted with hard currency, that is, currency that was freely convertible. Because the ruble was not freely convertible, the Soviet Union could only acquire hard currency by selling Soviet goods or gold on the world market for hard currency. Therefore, the volume of imports from countries using convertible currency depended on the amount of goods the Soviet Union exported for hard currency. Alternative methods of cooperation, such as barter, counter trade, industrial cooperation, or bilateral clearing agreements were much preferred. These methods were used in transactions with Finland, members of Comecon, the People's Republic of China, Yugoslavia, and a number of Third World countries. Commodity composition of Soviet trade differed by region. The Soviet Union imported manufactured, agricultural, and consumer goods from socialist countries in exchange for energy and manufactured goods. The Soviet Union earned hard currency by exporting fuels and other primary products to the industrialized West and then used this currency to buy sophisticated manufactures and agricultural products, primarily grain. Trade with the Third World usually involved exchanging machinery and armaments for tropical foodstuffs and raw materials. Soviet aid programs expanded steadily from 1965 to 1985. In 1985 the Soviet Union provided an estimated US$6.9 billion to the Third World in the form of direct cash, credit disbursements, or trade subsidies. The communist Third World, primarily Cuba, Mongolia, and Vietnam, received 85 percent of these funds. In the late 1980s, the Soviet Union reassessed its aid programs. In light of reduced political returns and domestic economic problems, the Soviet Union could ill afford ineffective disbursements of its limited resources. Moreover, dissatisfied with Soviet economic assistance, several Soviet client states opened trade discussions with Western countries. In the 1980s, the Soviet Union needed considerable sums of hard currency to pay for food and capital goods imports and to support client states. What the country could not earn from exports or gold sales it borrowed through its banks in London, Frankfurt, Vienna, Paris, and Luxembourg. Large grain imports pushed the Soviet debt quite high in 1981. Better harvests and lower import requirements redressed this imbalance in subsequent years. By late 1985, however, a decrease in oil revenues nearly returned the Soviet debt to its 1981 level. At the end of that same year the Soviet Union owed US$31 billion (gross) to Western creditors, mostly commercial banks and other private sources. In the late 1980s, the Soviet Union attempted to reduce its hard-currency debt by decreasing imports from the West and increasing oil and gas exports to the West. It also sought increased participation in international markets and organizations. In 1987 the Soviet Union formally requested observer status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and in 1988 signed a normalization agreement with the European Economic Community. Structural changes in the foreign trade bureaucracy, granting direct trading rights to select enterprises, and legislation establishing joint ventures with foreigners opened up the economy to the Western technical and managerial expertise necessary to achieve the goals established by General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev's program of economic restructuring (perestroika). Development of the state monopoly on foreign trade The government of the Soviet Union always held a monopoly on all foreign trade activity, but only after the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953 did the government accord importance to foreign trade activities. Before that time, the Bolsheviks' ideological opposition to external economic control, their refusal to pay Russia's World War I debts, and the chaos of the Russian Civil War (1918‚Äì21) kept trade to the minimum level required for the country's industrial development. Active Soviet trade operations began only in 1921, when the government established the People's Commissariat of Foreign Trade. The commissariat's monopoly on internal and external foreign trade was loosened, beginning in 1921, when the New Economic Policy (NEP) decentralized control of the economy. Although the commissariat remained the controlling center, the regime established other organizations to deal directly with foreign partners in the buying and selling of goods. These organizations included state import and export offices, joint stock companies, specialized import and export corporations, trusts, syndicates, cooperative organizations, and mixed-ownership companies. The end of the NEP period, the beginning of the first five-year plan (1928‚Äì32), and the forced collectivization of agriculture beginning in 1929 marked the early Stalin era. The government restructured foreign trade operations according to Decree Number 358, issued in February 1930, which eliminated the decentralized, essentially private, trading practices of the NEP period and established a system of monopoly specialization. The government then organized a number of foreign trade corporations under the People's Commissariat of Foreign Trade, each with a monopoly over a specific group of commodities. The foreign trade monopoly appeared in article 14h of the 1936 Soviet Constitution. Stalin's policy restricted trade as it attempted to build socialism in one country. Stalin feared the unpredictable movement and disruptive influence of such foreign market forces as demand and price fluctuations. Imports were restricted to factory equipment essential for the industrialization drive that began with the first five-year plan. This equipment was paid for by exporting collectivised grain. World War II virtually halted Soviet trade and the activity of most foreign trade corporations. Trade was conducted primarily through Soviet trade representatives in Britain and Iran and the Soviet Buying Commission in the United States. After the war, Britain and other West European countries and the United States imposed drastic restrictions on trade with the Soviet Union. Thus, Soviet foreign trade corporations limited their efforts to Eastern Europe and China, establishing Soviet-owned companies in these countries and setting up joint-stock companies on very favorable terms. Comecon, founded in 1949, united the economies of Eastern Europe with that of the Soviet Union. Soviet trade changed considerably in the post-Stalin era. Postwar industrialization and an expansion of foreign trade resulted in the proliferation of all-union foreign trade organizations (FTOs), the new name for foreign trade corporations and also known as foreign trade associations. In 1946 the People's Commissariat of Foreign Trade was reorganized into the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The Ministry of Foreign Trade, through its FTOs, retained the exclusive right to negotiate and sign contracts with foreigners and to draft foreign trade plans. The State Committee for Foreign Economic Relations (Gosudarstvennyi komitet po vneshnim ekonomicheskim sviaziam‚ÄîGKES), created in 1955, managed all foreign aid programs and the export of complete factories through the FTOs subordinate to it. Certain ministries, however, had the right to deal directly with foreign partners through their own FTOs. On January 17, 1988, Izvestiia reported the abolition of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and GKES. These two organizations were merged into the newly created Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, which had responsibility for administering foreign trade policy and foreign aid agreements. Other legislation provided for the establishment of joint enterprises. The government retained its monopoly on foreign trade through a streamlined version of the Soviet foreign trade bureaucracy as it existed before the January 17 decree. Structure of the foreign trade bureaucracy In 1988 the foreign trade bureaucracy reflected the monopoly specification system created by the 1930 Decree Number 358. Under the authority of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) and the Council of Ministers, six central bodies, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, and numerous FTOs together planned, regulated, monitored, and carried out all Soviet foreign economic activity. =Administration= Although the CPSU has ultimate authority over all foreign economic activity, in the late 1980s administrative control was centralized in the Council of Ministers. More specifically, the council's State Foreign Economic Commission coordinated the activities of ministries and departments in the area of economic and scientific cooperation with socialist, developing, and developed capitalist states. Six central bodies under the Council of Ministers played important roles in foreign economic relations. The import and export of goods, services, and resources were managed by the State Planning Committee (Gosudarstvennyi planovyi komitet ‚Äì Gosplan), the State Committee for Material and Technical Supply (Gosudarstvennyi komitet po material'no- tekhnicheskomu snabzheniiu ‚Äì Gossnab), and the State Committee for Science and Technology (Gosudarstvennyi komitet po nauke i tekhnike‚ÄîGKNT). Gosplan formulated all import and export plans, coordinated the allocation of investment and other resources, and had final authority over all decisions concerning foreign trade, including trade levels and commodity composition. Gossnab coordinated the allocation of resources not handled by Gosplan and, as the central agency responsible for matching supplies with customers, played a major role in selecting and allocating imports. GKNT negotiated technical cooperation agreements and monitored license and patent purchases and sales in order to introduce new technology into the Soviet economy. The State Committee on Prices (Gosudarstvennyi komitet po tsenam ‚Äì Goskomtsen), the Ministry of Finance, and the State Bank (Gosudarstvennyi bank ‚Äì Gosbank) held jurisdiction over the financing of foreign trade. Goskomtsen established prices for all imports and some exports. The Ministry of Finance controlled the balance of payments and monitored the impact of foreign trade on the state budget. Finally, Gosbank set the exchange rate for the ruble and managed the system of exchange within the Soviet Union. Gosbank supervised the Foreign Economic Activity Bank (Vneshnii ekonomicheskii bank ‚Äì Vneshekonombank; until January 1, 1988, known as the Foreign Trade Bank), which provided international banking services for Soviet FTOs. =Operation= Until 1988 the two operative bodies involved solely and directly in foreign economic operations were GKES and the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The Ministry of Foreign Trade formulated draft import and export plans and regulated commodity trade. GKES supervised foreign aid programs and the export of complete plants. The Ministry of Foreign Trade or GKES had jurisdiction over most FTOs, which negotiated and signed commercial contracts with foreigners on behalf of individual enterprises. FTOs were generally organized by product, as had been the foreign trade corporations of the 1930s. Some industrial ministries or other agencies, however, had their own FTOs. As of early 1987, for example, forty-eight FTOs were under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and nine under the GKES, whereas the Ministry of the Maritime Fleet, the Ministry of the Fishing Industry, and the Ministry of Trade, among others, had their own FTOs. In addition, certain other agencies had their own FTOs: the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which handled international trade exhibitions; the State Committee for Physical Culture and Sports; the Central Union of Cooperatives; the State Committee for Publishing Houses, Printing Plants, and the Book Trade; the State Committee for Cinematography; and the State Committee for Science and Technology. =Structural reforms, 1986 to mid-1988= The cumbersome foreign trade bureaucracy contributed to a number of problems that hindered the efficiency and effectiveness of foreign trade. The lack of direct contact between Soviet enterprises and their foreign customers or suppliers frustrated both parties by unnecessarily delaying contract negotiations and the specification of technical details. In a May 1986 interview with Izvestiia, the general director of the Ministry of Foreign Trade's All-Union Association for the Export and Import of Technical Equipment, Boris K. Pushkin, reported that after an enterprise submitted a request for a foreign item, two to three years were required before it was included in the import plan and funds were allocated for its purchase. In the interim, the needs of the enterprise had often changed. Pushkin stressed the need to free enterprises from unnecessary petty supervision and excessive regulation. Taking such problems into account, the Twenty-Seventh Party Congress in February‚ÄìMarch 1986 declared that the party anticipated \\"a step- by-step restructuring of [the country's] foreign trade in order to make exports and imports more effective. In August of the same year, the CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers adopted the decree On Measures for Improving Management of External Economic Relations,\\" which outlined drastic steps to change the structure of the foreign trade bureaucracy. Also in August 1986, the Council of Ministers' State Foreign Economic Commission became a permanent body within the council, giving more authority and visibility to the commission, the domestic activities of which previously went largely unreported. The staff was augmented, and the chairman acquired a rank equivalent to that of deputy prime minister. The new charter stated that the commission's role was \\"to formulate and implement the country's foreign economic strategy so as to enhance its potential contributions to acceleration (uskorenie), strengthen the Soviet position in the world economy, and promote structured and organized development of economic cooperation with all groups of countries.\\" Until 1987 the forty-eight FTOs subordinate to the Ministry of Foreign Trade administered more than 90 percent of Soviet foreign trade turnover. In 1987 the ministry lost control of 20 percent of Soviet foreign trade turnover. The government granted direct foreign trade rights to twenty- one ministries and state committees, sixty-seven industrial enterprises, and eight interbranch scientific production complexes. Exporting enterprises gained the right to retain part of their hard-currency earnings. Each ministry or enterprise was to pay for its investment imports with its own hard currency, and the heads of ministries and enterprises became personally responsible for the efficient use of hard-currency funds. These measures gave enterprises more influence in import decision making. On January 13, 1987, the Council of Ministers adopted the resolution \\"On Questions Concerning the Creation, on U.S.S.R. Territory, and the Activities of Joint Enterprises, International Associations, and Organizations with the Participation of Soviet and Foreign Organizations, Firms, and Management Bodies,\\" or, more simply, a law on joint ventures. This legislation opened up enterprises inside the Soviet Union for the first time since the Bolshevik Revolution, to foreign participation. Joint ventures were to facilitate the acquisition and assimilation of Western technology, managerial know-how, and marketing abilities. Optimistic about the economic effects of their new undertaking, Soviet officials declared that 85 to 90 percent of \\"the most important types of machinery\\" would meet world technical standards by 1990. The Soviet Union's vast natural resources and its lucrative, previously closed, domestic market attracted Western companies. By August 1988, more than fifty joint ventures were registered in the Soviet Union, and approximately three hundred were under negotiation. Nevertheless, numerous obstacles arose in the first eighteen months after the government adopted the joint venture law. Complaints by Western partners dealt with uncertainties concerning Soviet trade regulations, problems with the supply of goods, the dilemma of the non- convertibility of the ruble, difficulties finding qualified Soviet managers, problems in projecting production costs (as of 1989 Soviet domestic prices were administratively set and not based on market forces), and even complications finding office space in Moscow. Soviet trade officials' efforts to accommodate these complaints included the decentralization of the foreign trade bureaucracy, the establishment of a management institute in Moscow, price reforms, and various legal reforms. Before Western businessmen could recover from the confusion and disruption caused by this series of reforms, a second series began in early 1988. Effective January 1, 1988, the Foreign Trade Bank (Vneshnii torgovii bank ‚Äì Vneshtorgbank) was renamed the Foreign Economic Activity Bank (Vneshnii ekonomicheskii bank ‚Äì Vneshekonombank). The name change did not signify a major change in the bank's duties but simply more accurately reflected the nature of its operations. Vneshtorgbank had branched out from the simple management of foreign trade transactions to provide currency, credit, and accounting services as well. In a change from its previous duties, Vneshekonombank was required to administer new procedures dealing with Soviet firms that had recently acquired direct foreign trade rights. Also on January 1, 1988, the New Enterprise Law went into effect, making enterprises economically accountable for their own business operations by 1989. According to this law, the government had the power to disband unprofitable businesses, and each ministry and its subordinate enterprises gained the responsibility for their own foreign trade activities. In addition, Gosplan, Gossnab, and GKNT relinquished some of their rights to allocate money and goods. Finally, the Ministry of Foreign Trade lost control of 15 percent more of its foreign trade turnover when fourteen additional enterprises and four other ministries acquired direct foreign trade rights. Yet probably the most significant change in the foreign trade mechanism occurred on January 17, 1988, when Izvestiia announced the abolition of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and the GKES. The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, headed by Konstantin F. Katushev, former head of the GKES, assumed the duties of the two agencies. \\"Thus, the state monopoly on foreign trade and its state-wide aspects remains centralized,\\" reported the Soviet foreign trade monthly Vneshniaia torgovlia (Foreign Trade), \\"while operational functions are continually being shifted to the business level.\\" In March 1988, the journal reported that approximately 20 percent of foreign trade turnover was handled by the eighty-one firms that had been granted the right to deal directly with foreigners. Other reforms followed in April 1988, when the Central Committee and the Council of Ministers agreed on a new charter for the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. In general, the chamber monitored foreign trade conducted outside the new Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. In addition, the chamber assisted Soviet production enterprises in locating Western partners and learning foreign trade practices. Trade with socialist countries In the late 1980s, the Soviet Union traded with fourteen socialist countries. The political and economic relationships between the Soviet Union and these countries determine the four groups into which these countries can be divided: members of Comecon; Yugoslavia; China; and the developing communist countries of Cambodia, Laos, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea). Business with socialist countries was conducted on a bilateral, country-by-country basis in which imports balanced exports. Soviet oil exports to these countries bought machinery and equipment and industrial consumer goods, as well as political support without the expenditure of freely convertible foreign currency. In addition, Soviet aid programs, which took the form of direct loans or trade subsidies, almost exclusively involved socialist countries. =The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance= The Soviet Union formed the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon) in 1949, in part to discourage the countries of Eastern Europe from participating in the Marshall Plan and to counteract trade boycotts imposed after World War II by the United States and by Britain and other West European countries. Ostensibly, Comecon was organized to coordinate economic and technical cooperation between the Soviet Union and the member countries. In reality, the Soviet Union's domination over Comecon activities reflected its economic, political, and military power. In 1989 Comecon comprised ten countries: the six original members‚ÄîBulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the Soviet Union‚Äîplus the German Democratic Republic (East Germany, which joined in 1950), Mongolia (1962), Cuba (1972), and Vietnam (1978). Albania, although it joined in February 1949, has not participated in Comecon activities since 1961. Since 1949 the Soviet Union has traded primarily with other Comecon members. In 1960 the Soviet Union sent 56 percent of its exports to and received 58 percent of its imports from Comecon members. From that time, the volume of this trade has steadily increased, but the proportion of Soviet trade with Comecon members decreased as the Soviet Union sought to increase trade with Western industrialized countries. In contrast to 1960, trade with Comecon members accounted for only 42 percent of Soviet exports and 43 percent of Soviet imports in 1980. The European members of Comecon have looked to the Soviet Union for oil; in turn, they have provided machinery, equipment, agricultural goods, industrial goods, and consumer goods to the Soviet Union. Because of the peculiarities of the Comecon pricing system, throughout the 1970s and early 1980s Comecon prices for Soviet oil were lower than world oil prices. Western specialists have debated the political motivation of this implicit price subsidy to Comecon members. The cohesiveness within Comecon members seemed remarkable when in 1985 the fall in the world price left Comecon members paying above-market prices for Soviet oil. The membership of Cuba, Mongolia, and Vietnam in Comecon has served Soviet foreign policy interests more than the economic welfare of Comecon members. In general, the more economically developed European members have supported the three less developed members by providing a large market for their exports, often at above-market prices. Most of Cuba's sugar and nickel and all of Mongolia's copper and molybdenum have been imported by the Soviet Union. In addition, the Soviet Union has established naval and air bases in Cuba and Vietnam. Since 1985 Gorbachev has called for an increase in trade with Comecon members. At the Twenty-Seventh Party Congress in FebruaryMarch 1986, both he and Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov stressed the need to improve cooperation with the socialist countries on the basis of Comecon's Comprehensive Program for Scientific and Technical Cooperation up to the Year 2000. This program stressed the self-sufficiency of Comecon countries in five key areas: electronics, automation of production, nuclear power, biotechnology, and development of new raw materials. It also called for improvement of plan coordination, joint planning, Comecon investment strategy, production specialization, and quality of machinery and equipment exported to the Soviet Union. =Yugoslavia= In 1964 Yugoslavia negotiated a formal agreement of cooperation with Comecon. This relationship allowed Yugoslavia to maintain its nonaligned position while acquiring almost all the rights and privileges of a full Comecon member. In the 1980s, the Soviet Union's trade relationship with Yugoslavia resembled its relationship with full members of Comecon. The Soviet Union exported fuel, ferrous metals, plastics, and fertilizer to Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia's machine-tool, power- engineering, shipbuilding, and consumer goods industries supplied the Soviet Union with soft-currency goods. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Yugoslavia became more dependent on Soviet oil, as hostilities in the Persian Gulf cut off its supply of Iraqi oil. In addition, from 1970 well into the 1980s actual trade with the Soviet Union exceeded planned trade volumes. Thus, in 1983 the Yugoslav government informed Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Tikhonov of its desire to decrease trade with the Soviet Union in the mid-to-late 1980s. Because of the huge foreign currency debt accumulated by Yugoslavia from 1981 to 1985, however, the Soviet Union remained its most important trade partner in the late 1980s. In fact, for some Yugoslav products, such as shoes, the Soviet Union was the sole foreign buyer. =China= In the 1950s, the Soviet Union claimed half of China's foreign trade. The political rift that developed between the two countries in the late 1950s culminated in 1960 with the withdrawal of more than 1,000 Soviet specialists from China and an official break in trade relations in 1964. Although it had been only an observer, China stopped attending Comecon sessions in 1961. Economic relations between the Soviet Union and China resumed in 1982. Primarily as a result of Soviet political concessions and pressures on the Chinese to expand trade, trade volume between the two countries increased tenfold between 1982 and 1987. In the 1980s, the Soviet Union proved to be an ideal trade partner for China. China's exports were not competitive on the world market, and its foreign currency reserves were severely depleted by record foreign trade deficits in 1984 and 1985. Likewise, the Soviet Union, producing dated technology that was difficult to market in more industrially advanced countries and acquiring a growing hard-currency debt, eagerly pursued the Chinese market. Each country would sell the other goods it could not market elsewhere, and each could conserve scarce hard currency by bartering. The Soviet Union possessed machinery, equipment, and technical know-how to help China develop its fuel and mineral resources and power, transportation, and metallurgical industries. China could offer a wealth of raw materials, textiles, and agricultural and industrial consumer goods. Stepped-up economic relations reflected Soviet flexibility in overcoming various political and administrative stumbling blocks. By mid-1988 Gorbachev was speaking of reducing Soviet troops on the Chinese border, Vietnam had removed half of its troops from Cambodia, and Soviet troops had begun their withdrawal from Afghanistan. Reforms of the Soviet foreign trade complex established free trade zones in the Soviet Far East and Soviet Central Asia, simplifying border trade between the two countries. Soviet trade officials persuaded the Chinese to expand business ties beyond border trade into joint ventures, co-production contracts, and the export of surplus Chinese labor to the Soviet Union. The Peking Restaurant in Moscow, specializing in Chinese cuisine, became the first joint venture between the Soviet Union and China. In April 1988, China's minister of foreign economic relations and trade, Zheng Toubin, stated that China would continue to expand trade with the Soviet Union \\"at a rapid pace,\\" thus rewarding Soviet persistence in expanding trade with China. =Cambodia, Laos, and North Korea= Soviet economic relations with non-Comecon communist states have taken the form of aid and trade. In 1987 approximately 85 percent of Soviet aid went to the communist Third World. By far the largest share of these funds was absorbed by Cuba, Mongolia, and Vietnam. The rest was left to Cambodia, Laos, and North Korea. Pledges of Soviet aid increased steadily from 1985 through 1988 and were divided evenly between direct aid and trade subsidies. Commodity exchange was characterized by the Soviet Union's providing machinery, fuel, and transportation equipment in return for Laotian ores and concentrated metals, North Korean rolled ferrous metals and labor, and Cambodian rubber. Trade with Western industrialized countries The Western industrialized countries include the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Soviet trade with industrialized countries, except Finland, consisted of simple purchases paid for on a cash or credit basis, direct exchange of one good for another (Pepsi-Cola for Stolichnaya vodka, for example), or industrial cooperation agreements in which foreign firms participated in the construction or operation of plants in the Soviet Union. In the latter instances, payments were rendered in the form of the output of new plants. By contrast, trade with Finland, which did not have a convertible currency at that time, was conducted through bilateral clearing agreements, much like Soviet trade with its Comecon partners. In the 1970s and 1980s, the Soviet Union relied heavily on various kinds of fuel exports to earn hard currency, and Western partners regarded the Soviet Union as an extremely reliable supplier of oil and natural gas. In the 1980s, the Soviet Union gave domestic priority to gas, coal, and nuclear power in order to free more oil reserves for export. This was necessary because of higher production costs and losses of convertible currency resulting from the drop in world oil price. The development of natural gas for domestic and export use was also stimulated by these factors. Between 1970 and 1986, natural gas exports rose from 1 percent to 15 percent of total Soviet exports to the West. Because of the inferior quality of Soviet goods, the Soviet Union was unsuccessful in increasing its exports of manufactured goods. In 1987 only 18 percent of Soviet manufactured goods met world technical standards. As an illustration of these problems in quality, Canadian customers who had purchased Soviet Belarus tractors often found that the tractors had to be overhauled on arrival before they could be sold on the Canadian market. In 1986 less than 5 percent of Soviet exports to the West consisted of machinery. Other Soviet nonfuel exports in the 1990s included timber, exported primarily to Japan, and chemicals, the export of which grew substantially in 1984 and 1985. In the 1980s, Soviet imports from Western industrialized countries generally exceeded exports, although trade with the West decreased overall. One-half of Soviet agricultural imports were from developed countries, and these imports made up a considerable portion of total imports from the West. Industrial equipment formed one-quarter of Soviet imports from the West, and iron and steel products, particularly steel tubes for pipeline construction, made up most of the rest. Over the course of the 1980s, high-technology items gained in importance as well. In the 1970s and 1980s, Soviet trade with the Western industrialized countries was more dynamic than was Soviet trade with other countries, as trade patterns fluctuated with political and economic changes. In the 1970s, the Soviet Union exchanged its energy and raw materials for Western capital goods, and growth in trade was substantial. Soviet exports jumped 55 percent, and imports jumped 207 percent. The Soviet Union ran a trade deficit with the West throughout this period. In 1980 the Soviet Union exported slightly more to the West than it imported. After a temporary shortage of hard currency in 1981, the Soviet Union sought to improve its trade position with the industrialized countries by keeping imports at a steady level and by increasing exports. As a result, the Soviet Union began to run trade surpluses with most of its Western partners. Much of the income earned from fuel exports to Western Europe was used to pay off debts with the United States, Canada, and Australia, from which the Soviet Union had imported large quantities of grain. In 1985 and 1986, trade with the West was suppressed because of heightened East-West political tensions, successful Soviet grain harvests, high Soviet oil production costs, a devalued United States dollar, and falling oil prices. Despite increases in oil and natural gas exports, the Soviet Union's primary hard-currency earners, the country was receiving less revenue from its exports to the West. The Soviet Union sold most of its oil and natural gas exports for United States dollars but bought most of its hardcurrency imports from Western Europe. The lower value of the United States dollar meant that the purchasing power of a barrel of Soviet crude oil, for example, was much lower than in the 1970s and early 1980s. In 1987 the purchasing power of a barrel of Soviet crude oil in exchange for West German goods had fallen to one-third of its purchasing power in 1984. With the exception of grain, phosphates used in fertilizer production, and high-technology equipment, Soviet dependence on Western imports historically has been minimal. A growing hardcurrency debt of US$31 billion in 1986 led to reductions in imports from countries with hard currencies. In 1988 Gorbachev cautioned against dependence on Western technology because it required hard currency that \\"we don't have.\\" He also warned that increased borrowing to pay for imports from the West would lead to dependence on international lending institutions. =United States= Trade between the United States and the Soviet Union averaged about 1 percent of total trade for both countries through the 1970s and 1980s. Soviet-American trade peaked in 1979 at US$4.5 billion, exactly 1 percent of total United States trade. The Soviet Union continuously ran a trade deficit with the United States in the 1970s and early 1980s, but from 1985 through 1987 the Soviet Union cut imports from the United States while maintaining its level of exports to balance trade between the two countries. In 1987 total trade between the United States and the Soviet Union amounted to US$2 billion. The Soviet Union exported chemicals, metals (including gold), and petroleum products in addition to fur skins, alcoholic beverages, and fish products to the United States and received agricultural goods‚Äîmostly grain‚Äîand industrial equipment in return. The value of exports to the Soviet Union in 1987 amounted to US$1.5 billion, three-quarters of which consisted of agricultural products and one-quarter industrial equipment. Competition from other parts of the world, improvements in Soviet grain production, and political disagreements between the two countries adversely affected American agricultural exports to the Soviet Union in the 1980s. In 1985 and 1986, trade was the lowest since 1973. The Soviet Union had turned to Canada and Western Europe for one-third of its grain supplies, as well as to Argentina, Eastern Europe, Australia, and China. United States government price subsidies helped to expand grain exports in 1987 and 1988. The United States has long linked trade with the Soviet Union to its foreign policy toward the Soviet Union and, especially since the early 1980s, to Soviet human rights policies. In 1949, for example, the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom) was established by Western governments to monitor the export of sensitive high technology that would improve military effectiveness of members of the Warsaw Pact and certain other countries. The Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which was attached to the 1974 Trade Reform Act, linked the granting of most-favored- nation to the right of Soviet Jews to emigrate. In 1987 the United States had reason to reassess its trade policy toward the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union had restructured and decentralized authority for trade under the Ministry of Foreign Trade, made improvements in human rights policies, cooperated in arms control negotiations, and shown a willingness to experiment with joint ventures. Furthermore, the United States government recognized that restrictive trade policies were hurting its own economic interests. In April 1988, Soviet and American trade delegations met in Moscow to discuss possibilities for expanded trade. Through increased trade with the United States, the Soviet Union hoped to learn Western management, marketing, and manufacturing skills. Such skills would increase the ability of the Soviet Union to export manufactured goods, and thus earn hard currency, and would improve its competitiveness on the world market. The delegations declared that Soviet-American cooperation would be expanded in the areas of food processing, energy, construction equipment, medical products, and the service sector. =Western Europe= In the mid-1980s, West European exports to the Soviet Union were marginal, less than 0.5 percent of the combined gross national product of countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. OECD countries provided the Soviet Union with high-technology and industrial equipment, chemicals, metals, and agricultural products. In return, Western Europe received oil and natural gas from the Soviet Union. Although oil and gas were the primary Soviet exports to Western Europe, they represented only a small percentage of Western Europe's substantial fuel imports: Soviet oil provided 3 percent and natural gas 2 percent of the energy consumed in Western Europe. The completion of the Urengoy-Uzhgorod export pipeline project increased the importance of Soviet natural gas to Western Europe in the second half of the 1980s. In 1984 France, Austria, the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany), and Italy began receiving natural gas from western Siberia through the pipeline, for which the Soviet Union was paid in hard currency, pumping equipment, and large-diameter pipe. By 1990 the Soviet Union expected to supply 3 percent of all natural gas imported by Western Europe, including 30 percent of West Germany's gas imports. Unlike the United States, the countries of Western Europe have not viewed trade as a tool to influence Soviet domestic and foreign policies. Western Europe rejected the trade restrictions imposed by the United States after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and the declaration of martial law in Poland in 1980. From 1980 to 1982, the United States embargoed the supply of equipment for the Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhgorod pipeline, but Western Europe ignored United States pleas to do the same. Despite the poor relations between the superpowers in the early and mid-1980s, Western Europe tried to improve international relations with the Soviet Union. One major step in this direction was the normalization of relations between Comecon and the European Economic Community (EEC). After fifteen years of negotiations, the EEC approved an accord that established formal relations with Comecon effective June 25, 1988. Although it did not establish bilateral trade relations, the agreement \\"set the stage\\" for the exchange of information. This accord marked Comecon's official recognition of the EEC. =Japan= In 1985 trade with the Soviet Union accounted for 1.6 percent of Japanese exports and 1 percent of Japanese imports; Japan was the Soviet Union's fourth most important Western trading partner. Japan's principal exports to the Soviet Union included steel (approximately 40 percent of Japan's exports to the Soviet Union), chemicals, and textiles. The Soviet Union exported timber, nonferrous metals, rare-earth metals, and fuel to Japan. In 1986, despite a reduction in trade between the two countries, the Soviet Union had a trade deficit with Japan. In 1987 trade dropped another 20 percent. Numerous controversies have thwarted Soviet-Japanese trade. The Toshiba affair, in which Japan was accused of shipping equipment to the Soviet Union that was prohibited by CoCom, caused Japanese-Soviet trade to decrease in 1987. In addition, the Japanese constantly prodded the Soviet Union to return the islands off the Japanese island of Hokkaid≈ç that had come under Soviet control after World War II. For its part, the Soviet Union complained of the trade imbalance and static structure of Japanese-Soviet trade. In the late 1980s, the Soviet Union tried to increase its exports to Japan and diversify the nature of the countries' relationship. Soviet proposals have included establishing joint enterprises to exploit natural resources in Siberia and the Soviet Far East, specifically, coal in the southern Yakutiya area of Siberia and petroleum on Sakhalin; cooperating in the monetary and credit fields; jointly surveying and studying marine resources and peaceful uses of space; and establishing joint activities in other countries. The Soviet Union also proposed branching out into joint ventures in the chemical and wood chip industries, electronics, machine tools, and fish processing. The first Japanese-Soviet joint enterprise, a wood-processing plant in the Soviet Far East, began operation in March 1988. The Soviet Union provided the raw materials, and Japan supplied the technology, equipment, and managerial expertise. =Finland= In contrast to the variable trade relationships the Soviet Union has had with other West European countries, its relationship with Finland has been somewhat stable because of five-year agreements that regulated trade between the countries. The first was established in 1947, and 1986 marked the beginning of the eighth. Accounting procedures and methods of payment were agreed upon every five years as well by the Bank of Finland and Vneshtorgbank. A steady growth in trade between the two countries occurred throughout the 1970s and 1980s. In the late 1980s, Finland was the Soviet Union's second most important trading partner among the Western nations, after West Germany. Trade with Finland, however, was based on bilateral clearing agreements rather than on exchange of hard currency used with other Western trading partners. In 1986 the Soviet Union shipped 4 percent of its exports to and received 3 percent of its imports from Finland. Finland provided the Soviet Union with ships, particularly those suited to Arctic conditions; heavy machinery; and consumer goods such as clothing, textiles, processed foodstuffs, and consumer durables. The Soviet Union exported oil, natural gas, and fuel and technology for the nuclear power industry. The system of bilateral clearing agreements on which Soviet-Finnish trade was based required that any increase in Finnish imports from the Soviet Union be accompanied by a corresponding increase in exports to the Soviet Union in order to maintain the bilateral trade balance. At the beginning of the 1980s, Finland increased its imports of Soviet oil, which allowed it to increase its exports to the Soviet Union. This procedure accounted for the steady growth in Soviet-Finnish trade into the late 1980s. By 1988 about 90 percent of Soviet exports to Finland consisted of oil. Because the Finns imported more oil than they could consume domestically, they reexported it to other Scandinavian and West European countries. The Finns complained in late 1987 and early 1988 of a decline in Soviet ship orders and of delinquent payments. The share of Finland's exports to the Soviet Union, which had previously been as high as 25 percent, dropped to 15 percent in 1988. Trade with Third World countries The Third World embraces those countries the Soviet Union terms \\"developing countries.\\" This category includes those countries of socialist orientation that have some sort of privileged economic affiliation with the Soviet Union, such as Afghanistan, Angola, Iraq, and Nicaragua, but excludes the developing countries ruled by Marxist-Leninist parties, such as Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. Soviet trade with the Third World has been marked by two characteristics. First, although the Soviet Union has generally played only a minor role in Third World trade, Soviet imports or exports have formed a large portion of the total trade of some countries. Second, the Soviet Union has concentrated its trade with the Third World in the hands of relatively few partners. For example, in 1987 India, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Argentina, Egypt, Turkey, Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Malaysia together accounted for 75 percent of Soviet imports from and 80 percent of Soviet exports to the Third World. Although Soviet trade with the Third World increased in volume from 1965 through 1985, it remained between 13 and 15 percent of total Soviet trade for exports and 10 and 12 percent for imports. The Third World's trade with the Soviet Union, however, decreased in the 1970s and into the 1980s. These data include Cuba, since the only figures available concerning Third World trade with the Soviet Union include Cuba. As a percentage of overall Third World trade, the Soviet Union's share fell from 3.9 percent in 1970 to 2.5 percent in 1981. Deducting Soviet trade with Cuba, which has been considerable, would show an even smaller role played by the Soviet Union in Third World trade. In the late 1980s, the Soviet Union sought arrangements that would allow it to maintain a level of trade that minimized the loss of hard currency. =Balance of trade= During the 1980s, the Soviet Union exported more to Third World countries than it imported from them. Official Soviet statistics showed a trade deficit for this period, but arms and military equipment sales, which were not reported and are thus termed \\"unidentifiable\\" exports, accounted for approximately 50 percent of total exports to the Third World throughout the 1980s. Thus, the Soviet Union's hard-currency balance of trade, including arms sales, with the Third World was positive from 1980 through 1986. In fact, the Soviet Union's positive hard- currency trade balance with the Third World exceeded its hard-currency deficit with the Western industrialized countries in 1985 and 1986. For this reason, the Soviet Union showed an overall positive hardcurrency trade balance for these years. Until the mid-1970s, bilateral clearing agreements were the primary means by which the Soviet Union settled accounts with its Third World partners. By the early 1980s, hard-currency payments had become the preferred means of settlement. Clearing agreements were used in less than half of all trade transactions. On occasion, the Soviet Union bartered arms for oil. =Composition of trade= Not including arms sales, machinery accounted for 20 percent of total sales to the Third World in 1985. Soviet exports of machinery took up an even higher relative share of total sales to Algeria, Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (South Yemen), and Turkey. From 1980 through 1984, fuel, mostly oil, made up approximately 33 percent of overall Soviet exports to the Third World, including 50 percent of its exports to Asia and 60 to 70 percent of its exports to Latin America. Since 1985 greater competition on the world market resulting from falling world oil prices and rising Soviet extraction costs has prompted the Soviet Union to try to replace its export of oil with manufactured goods. The Soviet Union has been the largest arms exporter to the Third World for a number of years. Major arms customers were concentrated in the belt of countries that stretches from North Africa to India, close to the Soviet Union's southern border. Some 72 percent of Soviet weapons exports went to Algeria, India, Iraq, Libya, and Syria. Other important customers included Afghanistan, Angola, Ethiopia, South Yemen, and the Yemen Arab Republic (North Yemen). The Soviet Union lost arms customers in the 1980s, however, when Brazil and Egypt began to expand their arms sales to the Third World. India, which had experienced improvements in its hardcurrency balance in the 1980s, also started to buy arms from other suppliers. In an effort to retain its share of Indian arms customers, the Soviet Union continued to offer India its most sophisticated weapons at even more attractive rates. The Soviet Union has long been an importer of Third World agricultural products. These imports increased dramatically after 1980 because of poor Soviet harvests from 1979 into the early 1980s and the United States grain embargo against the Soviet Union in 1980 and 1981. From 1980 to 1985, food and agricultural goods, half of them grain, made up 50 percent of Soviet imports from the Third World. In the first nine months of 1986, the decrease in grain purchases accounted for most of the 22 percent drop in imports from the Third World. Africa and Latin America supplied most of the food imports other than grain. Throughout the 1980s, food imports steadily rose, but imports from individual countries fluctuated. Because of these fluctuations, the Soviet Union was often considered an unstable trade partner compared with Western customers. Because the Soviet Union was a major producer and exporter of most of the world's minerals, its import requirements for many other commodities (nonferrous metals, in particular) were sporadic. Nonetheless, the Soviet Union was a stable importer of some minerals, particularly bauxite and phosphate rock. The Soviet Union imported up to 50 percent of its bauxite from Guinea, Guyana, India, Indonesia, and Jamaica. Phosphate rock was abundant in the Soviet Union, but because extraction costs were high most of this mineral was imported from Morocco and Syria. A decline in Soviet imports of manufactured goods in the 1970s led Third World countries to pressure the Soviet Union to increase the import of these goods in the 1980s. In 1982 the Soviet demand for Third World manufactures began to rise. By 1984 manufactured goods, including manufactured consumer goods, made up 25 percent of Soviet imports from the Third World. Beginning in 1973, in an effort to earn hard currency, the Soviet Union began to import oil from Third World countries for reexport to Western industrialized countries. This activity slowed from 1980 to 1982, recovered in 1983 through 1985, and continued to increase in 1986. Late that year, the Soviet Union signed an agreement with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) that restricted the amount of oil it could buy for reexport. By 1988 this agreement had not cut total Soviet oil receipts, however, because oil was paid to the Soviet Union as compensation in arms sales. =Africa, Asia, and Latin America= During the 1980s, the geographical pattern of Soviet-Third World trade changed markedly. A decrease in trade with North Africa and the Middle East balanced a substantial increase in trade with sub- Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America. In 1987 about 50 percent of the Soviet Union's total identified exports to the Third World went to Asia, and India was the Soviet Union's biggest trade partner. In exchange for Soviet oil and oil products, India supplied food, raw agricultural material, clothing, textiles, and machinery. India was also the Soviet Union's sole significant Third World supplier of equipment and advanced technology, e.g., computers and copiers, much of which was produced by Indian subsidiaries of Western multinational corporations. Malaysia, another important partner of the Soviet Union in Asia, was an important supplier of rubber, palm oil, and tin. From 1980 to 1983, Soviet exports to Africa increased slightly to 30 percent of its Third World exports and decreased thereafter. Imports from Africa fluctuated from 1980 to 1985 but remained at about 25 percent. Nigeria was the Soviet Union's only important trade partner in sub-Saharan Africa, receiving Soviet machinery and exporting cocoa. Exports to Latin America grew during the 1980s and reached 8 percent in 1985. Latin America's share of Soviet Third World imports was high (40 percent in 1982) because of large imports of Argentine grain. As the Soviet Union's main grain supplier, Argentina was the Soviet Union's most significant import partner in the Third World in 1980, 1981, and 1983. In 1986 the Soviet Union renewed its grain agreement with Argentina for another five years. However, because of a US$11 billion trade deficit with Argentina that the Soviet Union had amassed from 1980 through 1985 and the successful Soviet harvest of 1986, the Soviet Union cut its grain imports from Argentina drastically. In 1986 they were at a six-year low. =Countries of socialist orientation= The countries of socialist orientation can be categorized into two groups: those that had observer status in Comecon and those that were not observers but had privileged affiliations with Comecon member countries. The Soviet Union's trade with the Third World has always been heavily skewed toward countries of socialist orientation. Soviet aid provided most of the foreign capital for these countries and influenced their domestic economic development significantly. The Soviet Union often profited more politically than economically from this trade: most Soviet surpluses were not repaid but became clearing credit, longterm cooperation credit, or short- term commercial credit. In 1986 the countries that had observer status in Comecon were Afghanistan, Angola, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Nicaragua, and South Yemen. These countries were all characterized by political instability, low GNP, and low export potential. The share of exports to this group rose from 14 percent of total Soviet identified exports to the Third World in 1980 to 28 percent in the first nine months of 1986. Afghanistan, a recipient of Soviet machinery and military equipment, was the Soviet Union's most significant partner in this group. By contrast, trade with Mozambique and South Yemen was negligible. Countries that had privileged affiliations with Comecon countries were Algeria, Benin, Burma, Congo, Guinea (until 1984), Iraq, Madagascar, Nicaragua (1979‚Äì85), Nigeria, Syria, and Tanzania and, at times, Guinea- Bissau, Mali, Seychelles, and Zimbabwe. Throughout the 1980s, Soviet exports to these countries oscillated, for example, from 27 percent in 1981 to 15 percent in 1983. This fluctuation, as well as fluctuations in imports, was primarily a result of changes in trade with Iraq, a major Soviet arms-for-oil trading partner in the Third World. =Trade with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries= The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), particularly Iraq and Algeria, absorbed the largest share of the Soviet Union's \\"unidentified\\" exports. Although Soviet statistics usually showed a very low or negative trade balance with these countries, the balance was probably high because of arms sales. In the 1980s, some OPEC countries, particularly Iran and Iraq, together with Syria, which was not a member of OPEC, exchanged oil for Soviet arms and military equipment. Oil from these countries was resold to the West for hard currency. In the late 1980s, the Soviet Union attempted to increase its exports of nonmilitary goods to these countries. In May 1986, the Soviet Union and Iraq agreed to increase Soviet nonmilitary equipment sales, and in August 1986 an attempt was made to revive Iraqi gas sales. Gorbachev's economic reforms When Mikhail Gorbachev delivered his report on the CPSU's economic policy on June 12, 1985, he noted that growth in exports, particularly machinery and equipment, was slow because the poor quality of Soviet goods prohibited them from being competitive on the world market. In the next three years, Gorbachev introduced many changes that would enable the foreign trade complex to better support his economic policy of acceleration. By May 1988, the structure of the Soviet foreign trade complex had been changed, and operations had been dramatically overhauled. The price reform called for by the Twenty-Seventh Party Congress was an important step in improving Soviet international economic involvement. Soviet officials admitted that pricing was \\"economically unsubstantiated\\" and \\"unrealistic.\\" They understood that although a fully convertible ruble would not be possible for some time, prices that more accurately reflected production costs, supply and demand, and world market prices were essential for developing a convertible currency. The nonconvertible ruble and the Soviet pricing system discouraged Western businessmen who could not accurately project production costs nor easily convert their ruble profits. The new joint venture law, passed on January 13, 1987, opened up the Soviet economy to foreign participation, particularly in manufacturing. It was believed that the experience gained in such ventures would facilitate integration into the world economy. Specifically, through upgraded production processes, the Soviet Union could export more competitive manufactured goods and decrease its dependency on energy and raw materials to earn hard currency. In August 1987, the Soviet Union formally requested observer status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The Soviet Union also expressed its desire to join other international economic organizations and establish contacts with other regional groups. A major step in this direction occurred in 1988 when the Soviet Union signed a normalization agreement with the EEC. The Soviet government, however, professed no interest in joining the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Although Soviet officials claimed that the international monetary system \\"was not managed properly,\\" it is more likely that IMF and World Bank regulations were the obstacles: both institutions required that members' currencies be freely convertible and that members provide accurate information concerning gold sales and economic performance. Gorbachev transformed the role of foreign trade in the Soviet economy. Whereas imports previously were regarded exclusively as a vehicle to compensate for difficulties in the short term, Soviet economists under Gorbachev declared that imports should be regarded as alternatives to domestic investment and that exports should serve to gauge the technical level of domestic production. Foreign economic ties were to support growth in production beyond the capacities of the domestic economy. The Soviet Union could thus take a place in the world market that was commensurate with its scientific and technical progress and political weight. Banks The Soviet Union controlled a number of banks abroad. The banks were used in foreign trade, espionage, money laundering and funding of Communist parties.

They gained widespread national exposure on Big Brother 5, a reality TV show in the United States which aired on CBS in 2004. Early life The twins attended Midfield High School, where they played softball. After graduating high school in 1992, they attended Troy State University in Troy, Alabama, where they each received Bachelor of Science degrees in computer science and minors in business and American Sign Language. They continued playing softball during college. After graduating, they both went to work at Electronic Data Systems. While still working for EDS, they began participating in fitness competitions. Adria married Lenny Klein in 1998. Natalie married Breck Carroll in 2000; the Carrolls separated in 2008 and later divorced. The twins' first significant success as competitors was in 1998, when Natalie placed first and Adria placed second in the Ms. Fitness Kentucky event. They quit EDS to focus entirely on fitness training in 2000. Fitness competition and training Starting in 2000, the twins signed up with HealthSouth Corporation, to go on a Roadshow Nationwide Tour called Go For It!, teaching fitness and nutrition to people, particularly middle school students. Along with this was a TV show for students called Go For It! TV, which they appeared on as competition coaches. After doing Go For It! for three years (the TV show for two), they continued with fitness competitions. The twins have since opened the Fitness Twins Elite Training Studio. Big Brother 5 In 2004, the twins appeared on the Big Brother 5 reality TV show as a single person named \\"Adria Okins\\". In the show, a group of contestants compete against one another to remain in the house as long as possible, as one person is evicted through a vote each week by fellow contestants. The fact that \\"Adria Okins\\" was really two different people was kept secret from fellow contestants for five weeks. This was done as part of the season's theme of \\"Do Not Assume (DNA)\\". Once the secret was revealed, they competed openly as two separate people.

Design  The Barracuda is based on commercially available 'off the shelf' components, but also many refined systems. Its fuselage is constructed entirely from carbon fibre, but also has a greater strength to weight ratio than traditional aircraft materials such as Aluminum (the structure of the Eurofighter Typhoon and Boeing 787 Dreamliner are also made significantly out of it). The only significant metal component is the wing spar, running through the middle and reinforcing the wings. The wing spar allows for easy removal of the wings for transportation. The Barracuda uses a specially shaped fuselage, including S-duct air inlet and V-tail, to scatter deflected radar, rendering the UCAV stealthy.

The movement's work and its goals spawned its name, the Hebrew word from meaning \\"two camps\\", in this case referring to Jerusalem and Moscow. Machanaim's founders are Dr. Zeev Dashevsky, Dr. Pinchas Polonsky, and Dr. Michael Kara-Ivanov. Machanaim began in Moscow behind the Iron Curtain in 1979, during the period of Brezhnev stagnation, as a group of young people who gathered to study Jewish history and tradition and pass on this knowledge on to their fellow Jews. Over time it developed into an organized underground network for studying Torah, Jewish philosophy, and Jewish law. Almost all the group members were refuseniks. Classes were sometimes interrupted by the KGB. In 1987 most of the Machanaim activists received permission to emigrate to Israel. There they set two main goals: to work with new immigrants and to provide assistance in Jewish education for those Jews still in the CIS. The organization has produced many books and classes, especially for conversion to Judaism. Its other main projects include teaching Judaism via the media, running a synagogue and other activities in Ma'aleh Adumim. It is an important proponent of Religious Zionism among Russian-speaking Jews. Other uses of the name Machanaim is also the name of a popular game played at Jewish summer camps and schools.

Taintor, 83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 366 (1872), was a United States Supreme Court case. It is commonly credited as having decided that a person to whom a suspect is remanded, such as a bail bondsman, has sweeping rights to recover the suspect. However, this is erroneous, since the commonly cited portion of the case, obiter dicta, has no binding precedential value (although dicta can have persuasive value). Case overview In 1866, sureties made an $8,000 cash bond for Edward McGuire in Connecticut, after he was charged with grand larceny. While awaiting trial in Connecticut, McGuire returned to his home in New York. Unknown to the bondsmen in Connecticut, McGuire was wanted in Maine for another felony. Upon request from the Governor of Maine later in 1866, the Governor of New York extradited McGuire to Maine, where he was convicted of burglary in 1867 and imprisoned for fifteen years. When McGuire failed to appear for trial in Connecticut in October 1866, the cash bond was forfeited. The Connecticut bondsmen sought relief from the forfeiture on grounds that they were not at fault in failing to secure McGuire's appearance, but rather that his nonappearance was the result of his extradition to Maine‚Äîan intervening \\"act of law\\" under the Extradition Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court, by a vote of 4 to 3 (two justices recused themselves) held that the sureties were at fault and were not protected by the Extradition Clause. The sureties' \\"supineness and neglect\\" in failing to keep up with McGuire and to inform the New York authorities of the pending Connecticut case caused McGuire's nonappearance.Lund v. Seneca County Sheriff‚Äôs Department, 230 F.3d 196, 198 (6th Cir. 2000) Commonly referenced paragraph It is not the holding of the case, but a single paragraph in the middle of the majority opinion is commonly referred to: :When bail is given, the principal is regarded as delivered to the custody of his sureties. Their dominion is a continuance of the original imprisonment. Whenever they choose to do so, they may seize him and deliver him up in their discharge; and if that cannot be done at once, they may imprison him until it can be done. They may exercise their rights in person or by agent. They may pursue him into another State; may arrest him on the Sabbath; and if necessary, may break and enter his house for that purpose. The seizure is not made by virtue of new process. None is needed. It is likened to the rearrest by the sheriff of an escaping prisoner. In 6 Modern it is said: \\"The bail have their principal on a string, and may pull the string whenever they please, and render him in their discharge.\\" The rights of the bail in civil and criminal cases are the same. They may doubtless permit him to go beyond the limits of the State within which he is to answer, but it is unwise and imprudent to do so; and if any evil ensue, they must bear the burden of the consequences, and cannot cast them upon the obligee.

The station used its original transmitter site in Nanuet, New York, for 52 years, although a new tower was erected in 2015 for the operation at 1700 AM. In April 2019 the station signed on from a new transmitter site in South Mountain Park in the town of Haverstraw, New York. Studios and offices are at 144 Ramapo Road in Garnerville, New York. The station airs a local morning talk show co-hosted by Steve Possell. Possell has been heard on Rockland's airwaves (previously on WRKL-New City, New York) for nearly 50 years. WRCR is the only radio station providing English language news and information specifically for Rockland County, as WRKL 910 AM in nearby Pomona, New York, switched to an all-Polish format on March 19, 1999. On July 13, 2015, WRCR moved from 1300 to 1700 kHz in the AM expanded band, increasing its power from 500 to 10,000 watts by day and 1,000 watts at night. The higher power allowed the station to be heard over a wider area of the lower Hudson Valley and Northern New Jersey. Along with the facility upgrade, the station's City of License was changed from Spring Valley to Ramapo. Both are communities in Rockland County. WRCR operated with the call letters WLIR, from late 1987 until 2000. WLIR had been the call letters for a famous and successful FM station operating in Garden City, New York.
