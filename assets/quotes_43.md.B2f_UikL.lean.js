December 1844 ‚Äì 17 November 1924) was a horse racing official in South Australia, one of the founders of the South Australian Jockey Club and its secretary from 1874 to 1884, and acted in an honorary capacity for four years while the Club was in recess. History Mr. Barnard was born at Portsmouth in February. 1844, and at the age of 17 was brought to South Australia with his parents. He was educated at St. Peter's College, and afterwards became one of Adelaide's leading auctioneers. He was a partner in the accountancy firm of Barnard & Chambers. S.A.J.C. When Barnard succeeded C. J. Coates as secretary of the South Australian Jockey Club in 1874 he found the club heavily in debt to the English, Scottish, and Australian Bank. W. B. Rounsevell, William Pile, Sir Richard Chaffey Baker, John Crozier, and Barnard elected to pay off the overdraft. In February 1874 the Hon. Thomas Elder offered about of land on the Glenelg line of railway, near the Morphett Arms Hotel, as a racetrack. The task of forming a company to administer the property fell to Barnard. To this end, the South Australian Jockey Club Company (Limited), a non-profit Company was formed by a small group of men in March 1874 with a capital value of ¬£1000, and Barnard was appointed its hon. secretary. The directors elected at the first general meeting of the Company were Sir Henry Ayers, Sir John Morphett, Thomas Elder, John Crozier, R. C. Baker, Philip Levi, Joseph Gilbert, E. W. Pitts, and H. B. Hughes, all highly influential gentlemen and racing enthusiasts. The Company promptly spent the money subscribed on establishing essential racing facilities on the Morphettville property. The course was laid out by R. C. Bagot, first secretary of the Victoria Racing Club. The course was partly walled in, a ladies' lawn laid, and a grand stand, judge's box, stewards' stand, telegraph office, loose boxes erected. The South Australian Jockey Club leased the property from the Company for one year, with a right of renewal from year to year for five years at a rental of 6 per cent. on the outlay, which seemed to the Club a very good deal. The sum of ¬£1,000 was found to be inadequate and the Company decided to increase the capital to ¬£7,000. The Company then sought from Sir Thomas Elder, and received, conversion of the peppercorn rental to freehold purchase of the Morphettville land so they had the ability to borrow against the value of the land. The first race meeting at Morphettville was held on 23 September 1875. Barnard and Sir R. C. Baker introduced a totalizator, which was conducted on a large sheet of cardboard in the secretary's office, the amounts invested being posted opposite the names of the horses. In 1881 the horse D.O.D. (previously Alarm), belonging to and named for Dan O'Dea, won the Goodwood Handicap, and paid the sensational dividend of ¬£836/16s. as only one person, one William Smith of Willaston, had backed the horse. By the nature of a totalizator, he would have made the same profit whether he had placed ¬£1 or ¬£100, but this was not accepted by the crowd, who thought the Club was acting unfairly and put the blame on Barnard. Shortly after that incident the Woolford totalizator (for Adelaide inventor Robert Woolford) was installed. It worked admirably until 1921, when it was replaced, and whose only drawback was that it did not show the grand total invested for each race. Another make of totalizator, from Hill & Schinnerling of Melbourne, had been trialled in 1879. The Club continued to lease the course, and to conduct meetings, but did not prosper as expected, largely due to competition from the Adelaide Racing Club. In 1884 the totalizator, which had been given exemption from aspects of the Gaming Act, became illegal again, and operation of the Club was no longer viable, and in desperation the Adelaide Cup meeting was in 1885 run at Flemington. This coincided with the severe South Australian drought of 1884‚Äì1886 and a consequent financial downturn. The S.A.J.C went into recess and held no meetings for four years. In December 1884 the South Australian Jockey Club Company (Limited) was voluntarily wound up, with Barnard appointed liquidator, and carried out the secretarial duties of the S.A.J.C. in an honorary capacity. Morphettville racecourse was placed in the hands of the Queensland Mortgage Company, and fell into a state of disrepair. The property was then purchased for ¬£8,000 by Thomas. F. Wigley, R. B. Pell, and Sylvester Browne. Browne subsequently purchased Pell's interest and in July 1889 Wigley and Browne placed the racecourse on the market in order to close the partnership; it was purchased by Browne. The Club was re-formed in 1888 with A. O. Whitington elected secretary. Racing by the S.A.J.C. was revived at Morphettville in 1889 after the right to use the totalizator had been granted by Parliament. Browne leased the course to the S.A.J.C. until 1895 when the freehold was acquired by Sir R. C. Baker, W. B. Rounsevell, William Pile, H. Chambers, P. F. Bonnin, Fred Ayers (son of Henry Ayers), and J. A. Ellery,James Albert Ellery (1844‚Äì1905) was father of T. G. Ellery (1872‚Äì1923) town clerk of Adelaide. He was a member of both the SAJC and ARC, later publican of Mac's Hotel, Mount Gambier who constituted the S.A.J.C. committee, so at last the course was the property of the S.A.J.C. Newmarket races Barnard leased the Morphettville course in 1879 to run a series of race meetings as a private venture which he termed \\"Newmarket Races\\" following the popularity of the V.R.C's \\"Newmarket Handicaps\\". The races were run under S.A.J.C. rules, and employed for the most part S.A.J.C. officials, but for his own benefit. The dates of his meetings were 22 February, 26 April, 20 June, 6 September, 18 October (deferred from 11 October and poorly attended), and the Christmas Newmarket of 27 December. :History was created after the Christmas Cup when J. Eden Savill verbally abused steward John Crozier after his horse was disqualified. Savill had apologised, but refused Barnard's demand that he publicly admit to \\"unsportsmanlike and ungentlemanly conduct\\". In a series of events strongly reminiscent of the 1889 Seth Ferry ‚Äî Tattersalls confrontation, the club committee convened a special meeting at which Savill was not present, and imposed on him a twelve months' ban from the course. Savill engaged several Q.C.s to sue certain members of that committee for penalising him without allowing him the opportunity to confront his accusers and defend himself. Savill won and was awarded costs, which would have been substantial. The Newmarket races of 28 February and later were run by the S.A.J.C. His horses Barnard successfully raced several horses, notably Totalizator, which won the Adelaide Cup in 1881, ridden by D. Bowes and trained by John Hill (who had also prepared the second and third place winners). Barnard considered that The Broker was the best horse he ever owned, and he won several good races with him. He was for a time owner of The Assyrian, but sold him, only to see him subsequently win the 1882 Melbourne Cup. Final days Barnard enjoyed excellent health throughout his life, only succumbing to illness six weeks before he died at his home \\"Garthowen\\" on Fisher-street, Malvern.

Career  He returned to London and at 21, started his professional career singing with the London Community Gospel Choir, eventually becoming one of their lead vocalists. Numerous tours round the world with the group and their work with many of the world's biggest recording artists led to opportunities for Macarthy to carve a career as a session singer, providing studio/live backing vocals for artists and groups such as Blur, Madonna, Beautiful South, Spiritualized, Death in Vegas, Billie Piper, Westlife, Will Young, P Diddy, Atomic Kitten, Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, Paul Carrack, Elton John, Art Garfunkel, Boy George, Eternal, Manu Dibango, R.

In 1999, he took a break from singing to enroll at the Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts, graduating 3 years later with a BA (Hons) in Acting. The school found out about his singing background after he'd completed his first year of study and tried to pressure him to transfer to their Musical Theatre course, but Macarthy refused. After graduating, he briefly returned to session singing, but soon decided to focus his efforts on acting instead. His first movie appearance was in Danny Boyle's 2004 feature Millions, in which he played the Ugandan martyr Gonzaga, followed by appearances in A Touch of Frost, Doctors, EastEnders, Torchwood and the Anthony Horowitz mini-series Collision; he also played the male lead in the supernatural thriller Patient 17, which went on to win the London Independent Film Festival award for Best Sci-Fi/Horror Feature in 2012.

The law makes provisions for criminalizing offences related to computer systems and Information Communication Technologies; provides for investigation, collection, and use of electronic evidence in Tanzania Mainland and Zanzibar except to article 50 which do not operate on the Zanzaibar. The Law further criminalizes and penalizes a number of cyber activities such as data espionage, publication of child pornography, publication of pornography, publication of false, deceptive, misleading or inaccurate information, production and dissemination of racist and xenophobic material, initiating transmission of or re-transmission of unsolicited messages and violation of intellectual property rights and other types of cybercrimes. This long-awaited law came after significant impacts such as financial loss, fraud and cyber bullying to the public and other stakeholders.  Enforcement  The official statistics about the trend of cybercrimes in Tanzania are hard to find but some Tanzania government officials have claimed reduction of the high rate of cybercrime, theft or fraud in the country since the government enacted the legislation in 2015. As a result of the law, statements from government officials in the news media claim that the number of suspected criminals arrested has rapidly increased. However a section of the media and activists have complained that the law gives power to the police than the common citizen  Challenges   Perceived Suppression of Freedom of Expression  Several complaints about the enforcement of Tanzania Cybercrimes law have been expressed by Tanzania civil society groups, scholars development partners, and the opposition parties in Tanzania. Specifically, the opposition political parties in Tanzania have voiced their concern about the government's use of the law to suppress the fundamental rights on freedom of expression and using the law to target the opposition political parties. Several instances have been reported on people being arrested for expressing their opinions on social media, for example one citizen deemed to have insulted the president of Tanzania through social media. Another case that underscores the perception of suppression of freedom of expression by the government is the arrest and subsequent charging under the Cybercrimes law, of a Tanzanian web based social forum founder for failing to reveal the identities of the commenters on his forum.  Common Citizen's Awareness of the Law  After enacting the law, the government embarked on various awareness campaigns. Despite of the efforts, a common citizen in Tanzania may have heard of the law because several cases frequently feature in the news media. However, according to one survey on Cybercrimes in Tanzania majority of the cybercrimes incidents go unreported to the police.  Proposals for Review  There have been attempts to challenge parts of the Cybercrimes Act through the courts and through the parliamentary process by several stakeholders. The news media frequently reports about the governments willingness to review the law and come up with future regulations relating to cybercrimes.

He was a leader of the resident Well Being in surgery movement and surgical training program leader. Early life and education Greco attended Mount Saint Michael Academy (1956 - 1960). In 1964 Greco began the study of medicine at Yale University. During his junior year he decided to pursue surgery and was accepted into the Yale Training Program. He interned in 1968-69 and also was an American Cancer Society Fellow. He also served as a surgeon at H√¥pital Albert Schweitzer in Haiti. This began a lifelong commitment to healthcare in Haiti as well as a passion for Haitian art. He completed the chief residency at Yale in 1973. Career Rutgers Medical School He joined the faculty at Rutgers (later Robert Wood Johnson Medical School) as an Assistant Professor of Surgery in 1975. His clinical practice included general, vascular and pediatric surgery. In 1978 in collaboration with Richard Harvey Ph D, professor of biochemistry, Greco developed the hypothesis that bio-materials could be rendered infection resistant by bonding antibiotics to their surfaces. This research resulted in a grant from the NIH in 1979 as well as multiple patents. He was promoted to Associate Professor and in 1983 to Professor of surgery. Thereafter he was appointed Director of the General Surgery Residency Program and Chief of General Surgery. Stanford University Greco accepted the offer of Stanford University to become the J & J Chair, Chief of General Surgery and Director of the General Surgery Training Program effective July 1, 2000. From 2001 to 2005, Greco modernized and developed subspecialties in surgical oncology, colorectal surgery, minimal access surgery and trauma. Balance in Life In this time frame Greco began his work on resident well being. This path was determined by one of his chief residents who, 5 months after graduation, committed suicide. First he worked with a small number of faculty and residents to create a well being program entitled Balance in Life, which became a model for others. Greco received the 2011 John Gienapp Award for lifetime contributions to GME, the highest honor given by the ACGME. Sculpture In 1987 Greco became interested in sculpture and studied under Lilli Gettinger for 5 years. Before moving to Stanford he had five exhibitions in the Northeast. Greco donated one of his pieces to Rutgers and donated two sculptures to Stanford in 2018.

On the way, Ian meets German, a local man who tells them about a nice spot near a waterfall. When they arrive there, they set up camp next to an abandoned campsite with no trace of its occupants. After a few nights, they become concerned when they discover a toddler on his own in the woods. Meanwhile elsewhere, German tells his associate Chook about Ian and Sam, and the two begin to make plans. Chook finds Ian and Sam with the baby stuck at the campsite parking lot with a flat tire. He persuades Ian to go and search for the missing family, while Sam stays at the car with the child. Three days earlier, the Baker family - Robert, Margaret, their 16-year-old daughter Emily, and their infant son, Ollie - had been camping on the beach. German and Chook showed up at the campsite and kidnapped Robert, Margaret, and Emily, unaware of Ollie‚Äôs presence. German and Chook raped Margaret and Emily, and tortured the family before murdering them all. After spotting Ollie in a photo on Emily's cell phone, they returned to search for him but he had wandered off. Back to the present, Chook leads Ian to where he and German left the Bakers' bodies. When they arrive, they discover that Margaret didn't die from her injuries. Ian tries to save her but Chook shoots her dead. Chook then explains his intent to rape Sam so Ian charges forward and knocks him down, then flees into the woodland. Meanwhile, German arrives at the campsite to find Sam alone with Ollie. German tries to abduct Sam from the car but she slashes his wrist and escapes with Ollie. German chases them along with this dog, Banjo. While hunting Ian, Chook mistakenly shoots German, then kills him to put him out his misery. Nearby, Ollie begins to cry, giving away Sam and Ollie‚Äôs location. Chook slams Ollie into the ground, seemingly killing him, and takes Sam hostage. He tells Ian he will be waiting at the killing ground where the Bakers are, and they leave. Ian comes out of hiding and notices German's car keys in his pocket. Meanwhile at the killing ground, Chook grows impatient that Ian hasn't come to save Sam so he threatens to rape her. He then hears Ian escaping in German's truck and drags Sam off with him as he attempts to intercept him. When they pass German's corpse, Sam notices that Ollie is missing. While in Chook's car, Sam fights with him, leading to him crashing into a tree, knocking them both unconscious. As night falls, Ian arrives at the police station and asks for help. He accompanies two officers to the campsite. Sam awakens in the wreck of the car with her hands tied to the steering wheel. The officers spot the wreckage and attempt to help, but Chook from afar shoots them dead. Chook also shoots Ian in the arm, holds him hostage, and demands Sam drive him to a safe location. Sam asks Ian if Ollie is okay, but Ian tells her that Ollie was never with him. While driving away from the woodland, Sam violently crashes the vehicle. Chook manages to crawl away from the wreckage, and scuffles with Sam before she smashes his head with a rock, finally killing him. Later on, Sam wakes up in a hospital and leaves her bed to find Ian recovering from his injuries in another room. Ollie is shown to have crawled away from German's corpse, and Banjo sits silently guarding him. His final fate remains unknown.

The company is based in Berlin- Sch√∂neberg and was founded in 1977 by an Austrian-born musician and engineer Dieter Burmester (1946‚Äì2015).  History  Burmester Audiosysteme got its beginning in 1977. As a musician since his early days, Dieter Burmester always wanted to make his audio components and loudspeakers reproduce music as naturally and purely as possible. It was the malfunction of a faulty preamplifier that caused the development of the first Burmester product. Because the products on the market couldn't satisfy Dieter Burmester's high demands, he built his own preamplifier, the Burmester 777 in July 1977 from parts of medical machines, which he produced in his own engineering office. The 777 is still the core element of Burmester's products and model of the type designation of the following components (composed of the year 77 and the month number 7). Because the 777 was very successful, Burmester wanted to bring the first hi-fi power amplifier with symmetrical signal routing on the market. This was a novelty for the hi-fi world. However, in the beginning it was difficult to convince retailers and journalists. By 1978, Burmester Audiosysteme GmbH was fully established. Already in 1978, the company introduced the characteristic chrome design, which has even found its way into the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Burmester 877 preamplifier and 878 power amplifier, incorporating the characteristic chrome design In 1980, Burmester developed and produced the world's first modular preamplifier, the Burmester 808. Further milestones are the symmetrical switching technology, which was first used by Burmester in 1983, the first amplifier with DC coupling from the phono stage through to the speaker terminals and the first remote controlled speaker adjustment with relay circuit resistors, both introduced in 1987. In 1991, the company brought the first belt-driven CD player to the market. In 1994/95, Burmester enlarged its portfolio with loudspeakers and brought the first speaker system with a dual active/passive crossover network. In some models they use an air motion transformer as a tweeter, or a particularly large chassis with a diameter of for the mid-range frequencies. Also in 1994, Burmester built a universal solution to clean the power supply. By now the manufacturer also offers in-wall loudspeakers and an all-in-one system. Dieter Burmester was named ‚ÄòEntrepreneur of the Year‚Äô in 2003 by the Berlin Association of Independent Business Owners. Burmester Audiosysteme is one of the founding members of the German Manufactories Initiative (Initiative Deutsche Manufakturen), the 'Handmade in Germany' foundation which represents German manufactories of handmade products and craftsmanship. Dieter Burmester died in August 2015 at the age of 69, after a short but severe illness. After his death, the company was led by his widow Marianne Burmester. On 1 January 2017, Andreas Henke joined as co-CEO of Burmester Audiosysteme.  Products  Burmester offers its products in three product lines and price points: Classic Line, Top Line, and Reference Line. As an extension to the traditional product lines, the Burmester Phase 3 is offered as an all-in-one home music system. All Burmester products are developed in Berlin, manufactured by hand and distributed by dealers in around 50 countries on 5 continents. Most of the component parts are sourced from Germany. Burmester loudspeakers in a Mercedes-AMG S-Class convertible  Burmester Automotive  In 2005, Burmester Automotive was founded to develop hi-fi sound systems for cars. = Bugatti = Burmester started with a sound system for the Bugatti Veyron. = Porsche = With the introduction of the Porsche Panamera in 2009, the Burmester Surround Sound System was introduced as an optional equipment. Within the following years the Burmester system could also be found on the option list for all other Porsche models. = Mercedes-Benz = The cooperation with Mercedes-Benz also started in 2009. Together the companies developed two new audio systems, in particular for the S-Class model. In the following years more sound systems have been introduced for the C-Class, the V-Class and the E-Class. In line with the partnership, sound systems for the Mercedes-AMG GT and the Maybach S-Class have been developed as well. Burmester's sound systems in the models of Porsche and Mercedes-Benz offer three different default settings: Pure, Smooth, and Live. The 3D-mode is only available in the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, the E-Class, the new W177 A-Class and the Porsche Panamera.

History A copy in Frankfurt (in poor condition and probably transferred from canvas to panel) and a preparatory sketch are the only evidence of the work. The sketch is on the back of a sheet of designs for a fresco at the San Giovanni Evangelista church in Parma, dating the Casalmaggiore Madonna commission to November 1522. The painting showed the Madonna and Child with an infant St John the Baptist, a motif revisited several times by Correggio from his youth (in Madonna and Child with the Infant John the Baptist for example) onwards. The Frankfurt work has divided critics - some see it as a copy of a lost original and others as an autograph work by Correggio in poor condition which may have entered the Galleria Estense when Francesco I occupied Casalmaggiore in1646.

Background Incumbent Mayor Roy McElroy of the Citizens & Ratepayers ticket was defeated by his predecessor Dove-Myer Robinson. Labour Party councillor George Forsyth ran again for a second time, however he was refused official party endorsement as Labour officials preferred Robinson as Mayor to McElroy and thought fielding their own candidate would allow McElroy to be re-elected on a split vote.

In 1881 the cemetery covered 18,000 m 2, while in 1906 it had already tripled and in 1931 it came to measure 54,000 m 2. The care of the cemetery was entrusted to the secular fathers and from 1850 to 1890 passed to the Cappuccino fathers; It was then directed by an inspector. Modern access is marked by a row of cypresses marking the monumental architecture of the place of silence, designed by architect Umberto Fabbrini. The grandeur of the valley that opens in front of the panoramic scenery of Mount Morello is so solemn that it deserves the definition of \\"Florence Valley of Josaphat\\". The Bracco Chapel was built by Giovanni Michelucci between 1969 and 1970.  Buried personalities  In the cemetery of Trespiano are rested the souls of the Carlo and Nello Rosselli, Giuseppe Poggi, Pietro Chesi, Mario Fabiani, Lando Conti, Piero Bargellini, Gaetano Pieraccini, Ernesto Rossi, Gaetano Salvemini, Piero Calamandrei, Spartaco Lavagnini, Aldobrando de 'Medici Tornaquinci, Ettore Nava, Luigi Dallapiccola, Ugo Schiff, Paola Pezzaglia, Carlo Betocchi, Rosa Balistreri, Luigi Michelet, Gillian Brilli Peri, Clement Biondetti, Roberto Assagioli, Mason Remey and Giaele Covelli.

He was educated by his uncle, Thomas Stackhouse (1706‚Äì1784), an educational writer. He wrote several school textbooks, on punctuation, the Bible, astronomy and other subjects. A particular interest was investigating the remains of the early inhabitants of Britain. After walking \\"considerably above a hundred miles ‚Ä¶ among the barrows\\" near Weymouth and Dorchester in Dorset, he wrote Illustration of the Tumuli, or Ancient Barrows (1806), which was dedicated to William George Maton. He wrote Two Lectures on the Remains of Ancient Pagan Britain (1833), the result of visits to the earthworks and remains in the southern counties, ranging from Tunbridge Wells to Bath; 75 copies were printed for private distribution. He also published Views of Remarkable Druidical Rocks near Todmorton, presumably Todmorden in West Yorkshire. Stackhouse joined the Society of Friends, and his speech at the eleventh annual meeting of the Peace Society is reported in The Herald of Peace (vol. vi. 1827). He married Ruth Fell on 18 December 1783 in Liverpool, where he worked as a tutor, and they had three sons and two daughters: the two elder children born in Lancashire, and the three younger (born after 1787) in London. He died in Hackney on 29 January 1836, and was buried, with his wife, who had died in 1833, at Park Street burial ground, Stoke Newington.

Adnan led his group, the Manbij Military Council and the Northern Sun Battalion, in every battle since its formation in 2014, including the Siege of Koban√Æ, the Tell Abyad offensive, the Tishrin Dam offensive, the al-Hawl offensive, the al-Shaddadi offensive, the Battle of Manbij, his hometown, where he freed his parents from ISIL rule in August 2016, and the Raqqa campaign, including the Battle of Raqqa, where he was killed in action on 29 August 2017.  Biography  Early life  Adnan Abdul Aziz Ahmed was born in 1977 in the city of Manbij in northern Syria, where he attended school. Adnan worked in his brother's pharmacy for 7 years.  Syrian Civil War  =2012‚Äì15= After the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War in 2011, Adnan Abu Amjad participated in protests against the Syrian government. In 2012, he joined a Free Syrian Army group in northern Syria. During his membership in the FSA group between 2012 and 2013, he participated in the Battle of Aleppo and the Battle of Qusayr. In July 2013, after attacks by Islamist groups, including al-Qaeda's al-Nusra Front, on Kurds in Tell Abyad, Tell Aran, and Tell Hasel, Adnan defected from the FSA group and joined the Kurdish Front. In 2014, Adnan Abu Amjad joined the Northern Sun Battalion, whose leaders included Abu Layla. In late 2014, the Northern Sun Battalion withdrew from its headquarters in Manbij after the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant took control of the city. While Abu Layla withdrew to Koban√Æ, Adnan headed to Afrin. In September 2014, Adnan was deployed to Koban√Æ to defend the city against an ISIL siege. After the recapture of Koban√Æ, Adnan fought in Tell Abyad and Ayn Issa in mid-2015. =2015‚Äì17= On 10 October 2015, Adnan Abu Amjad as the deputy commander of the Northern Sun Battalion became one of the founding members of the Syrian Democratic Forces. Under the SDF, he took part in offensives in al-Hawl, Tishrin Dam, and al-Shaddadi. On 2 April 2016, Adnan announced the formation of the Manbij Military Council in Tishrin Dam, with himself as the general commander of the council. On 31 May, the council and allied SDF groups launched the Manbij offensive to capture the city from ISIL. On 2 August, Adnan Abu Amjad freed his parents in the city after almost 2 years. By 12 August, the SDF captured Manbij and the Manbij Military Council took over its security on 15 August. The offensive extended Westward toward Al-Bab in order to connect to Afrin but was stopped due to the Turkish/Rebels offensive on Al- Bab, the push northward by SAA, and the lack of support from the US. Since late 2016, Adnan Abu Amjad led the Manbij Military Council in the SDF's Raqqa campaign. The Battle of Raqqa city began on 6 June 2017. On 29 August 2017, Adnan Abu Amjad was killed in action during the battle, during which over half of the city was captured by the SDF. His funeral was held in Manbij 2 days later.

Plot summary In a society is governed by the New Machine, individuals have lost their faces, and the RealTime calendar has destroyed their understanding of history or the future. A woman (the protagonist, played by Luksch) wakes up one day to discover she has a face; subsequently, she receives an anonymous letter that reveals the existence of her past life, and her child. Panicking, she enlists the help of Spectral Children to evade Overseers and confront the authority of the New Machine. In the film's ambivalent conclusion, she appears to defeat the New Machine by unveiling the power of the human face and recovering temporality.

The Metainterface: The Art of Platforms, Cities, and Clouds. MIT Press, 2018, p.99. Soundtrack Faceless has no spoken dialogue ‚Äì a natural consequence of the prohibition of audio surveillance in the UK. Instead, the story is told by a voice-over narrator. The film's soundtrack is almost entirely non-diegetic, comprising electronic and industrial elements composed in 5.1 surround sound to bring depth to the flat, wide-angle CCTV images, contrasted with predominantly stereophonic solo piano recordings by Rupert Huber. Critical analysis and interpretation Form and aesthetics In his essay 'Within the apparatus of control. On the enduring fascination of surveillance aesthetics',Roland Sch√∂ny. 'Within the apparatus of control. On the enduring fascination of surveillance aesthetics.' Translated by Helen Ferguson, Roland Sch√∂ny observes that the visual aesthetic of Faceless 'stems from the spatial apparatus of technical surveillance via the eye of the camera, [and is] reminiscent of early forms of video art. The images seem to stem from the past future (...) A constantly flickering image, colour distortion and fragmented sequences, complete with a visible time-code, are all significant elements in this semantic code.' Moreover, '[a]ttention is focused just as much on bustling areas, like underground stations or shopping malls, as on lonely car parks, underground garages or the parched periphery of housing estates, not to mention office premises or lobbies.' Andersen and Pold also remark on the perspective of the surveillance camera aimed at 'capturing as much of reality as possible, in contrast to the subjective camera conventionally used in films.'Andersen, Christian Ulrik and Pold, Bro S√∏ren. The Metainterface: The Art of Platforms, Cities, and Clouds. MIT Press, 2018, pp.97. Several commentators have noted that Luksch's film pays evident homage to Chris Marker's 1962 film La Jet√©e in its visual pacing and linguistic style.Thomsen, Bodil Marie. \\"The Performative Uses of the Surveillance Archive in Manu Luksch's Works.\\" Performing Archives / Archives of Performance, edited by Borggreen, Gunhild and Rune Gade, Museum Tusculanum Press, 2013, pp. 257-273. Eric Cazdyn, Professor of Aesthetics and Politics at the University of Toronto, remarks on the two films' complementarity: 'In La Jet√©e we have a single temporality occurring at different times, while in Faceless we have different temporalities occurring at the same time.'Cazdyn, Eric. The Already Dead. The New Time of Politics, Culture, and Illness. Duke UP, 2012, p. 97. Another influence on Faceless is evident in the ensemble dance sequences, which draw on the kaleidoscopic choreography of Busby Berkeley's musicals.The Eye ‚Äì Choreography for Surveilled Space. Directed by Manu Luksch. UK, 2005. Available on the Faceless DVD. Whereas Sch√∂ny summarises Faceless as a 'poetic narrative on the disappearance of history and identity in the panoptic era,' the writer and producer Robert Buchschwenter characterises it more forcefully as a traumatising 'metanarrative ¬ñof a society whose self-understanding is occluded by its dazzling media hyperpresence.'Buchschwenter, Robert. \\"Angstbilder gegen die Angst.\\" Translated by Steve Wilder as \\"Images of Fear, against Fear.\\" Ambient Information Systems, edited by Luksch, Manu and Mukul Patel, AIS, 2009, pp. 268-69. Filmmaking as d√©tournement Luksch uses the term 'tactical fiction' to describe an approach that hybridizes documentary and fiction to interrogate infrastructure and provoke reflection. Elizabeth Cowie remarks that the film is both 'an actual reality of the ordinary spaces of the city [...], and a fictional world'Cowie, Elizabeth. 'The World Viewed: Documentary Observing and the Culture of Surveillance'. In Juhasz, Alexandra and Lebow, Alisa (Editors). A Companion to Contemporary Documentary Film. Wiley Blackwell, 2015, p. 597. Through its manifesto-driven legal process, Faceless bridges fact and fiction and accomplishes a d√©tournement, or activist hijacking of the surveillance apparatus. Art and communication scholar Margarida Carvalho locates the work's force in its diversion of CCTV networks 'from their explicit purpose [...], endowing them with an experimental, artistic and activist dimension. [...The] city is transformed into a permanent film set and the act of creation becomes a gesture of appropriation and transformation of the omnipresent gaze of the surveillance cameras. In this context to create is to affectively populate a territory, to rescue it from the barrenness and lethargy in which the non-reciprocated gaze of the surveillance cameras had plunged it.'Carvalho, Margarida. \\"Affective Territories.\\" INFLeXions No. 3 - Micropolitics: Exploring Ethico-Aesthetics, edited by Himada, Nasrin, Erin Manning and Leslie Plumb, October 2009. Retrieved 6 September 2017. Carvalho further suggests that the film's ensemble dance sequences express a 'strangeness and poetic activism, evoking the contradictory forces that connect us to the spaces we so often cross and forget to inhabit.'

Fisk House is a private house located at 867 East Chicago Road in Coldwater, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. History Abram C. Fisk was born in Penfield, New York in 1815. He moved to Coldwater in 1835 and married Catherine Smith soon after. In 1840, the Fisks settled on an eighty-acre farm at this site, straddling the Chicago Road. They built a house on the south side of the road, near the current house. There Fisk raised horses, and gained a reputation as a leading thoroughbred breeder. In about 1861, the Fisks began construction of this house, finishing it within a few years. (note: large pdf file) Abram Fisk died in 1897, and the farm and house passed on to his son, William. In 1914, it was sold to Charles and Lena Moore, who passed it to their daughter, Eleanor Barthel. It was later sold to Mr. and Mrs. Carl Bohnenstadt, who used the house as an antique shop, and then Elizabeth Jewell purchased the house in 1961. On Elizabeth's death in 2000, the house passed to her son Philip Jewell. In 2012 Jewell began an extensive restoration of the house. As of 2016, Philip Jewell and his wife Catherine operate Blue Hat Coffee shop and roasters out of the house. Description The Abram C. Fisk House is a two-story red brick Italianate structure with a hip roof crowned with a cupola. The house measures 40 feet by 40 feet and stands on an ashlar stone foundation. The facade is symmetrical, and is decorated with raised brick pilasters and arched head windows. The eaves are supported with oversized paired brackets, shaped in a wheel-with-daisy pattern. A Colonial Revival porch spans the front of the house; this was likely added around 1900. The entryway is through a double door flanked by double-hung one-over-one windows. On the interior, the house has a square plan. The first floor originally contained a central hall, sitting room, parlor, dining room/ kitchen, and a small bedroom. The second floor originally contained four bedrooms and a bathroom. The ceiling height throughout the house is twelve feet. 1879 Gallery File:Abram Fisk House 1879 one.pngGrounds around the house, including race track File:Abram Fisk House 1879 two.pngChicago Road in front of house References External links *Blue Hat Coffee National Register of Historic Places in Branch County, Michigan Residential buildings completed in 1863 ","title":"Abram C.

During World War II, Poland incurred the greatest biological (for every 1000 inhabitants, she lost 220 people) and material losses (with an average $626 U.S. Dollar loss per inhabitant, compared to Yugoslavia's $601). In 1946, during the International Reparations Conference in Paris, Poland's material losses were evaluated to be $16,9 million U.S. Dollars, $9,1 mil. in Yugoslavia. Two-fifths of Poland's cultural property was totally destroyed. Due to the international pressure of the world powers, Poland was forced to hand-over 48% of its territory to the Soviet Union, equating to 178 000 km¬≤ of land. Most material losses were as a result of the German invader, others that of the responsibility of the USSR. Material losses under German occupation Saxon Palace, destroyed by Germans in December 1944 St. Michael Archangel's Church in Wielu≈Ñ, blasted by Germans in 1940 Royal Castle in Warsaw Br√ºhl Palace in Warsaw The aftermath of the bombing of Wielu≈Ñ. Some 70-75% of the town was destroyed in 1939. Material losses endured by Poland under the German occupant can be subdivided into several categories: * Losses as a result of warfare and resultant destruction, * Losses as a result of loot and confiscation of property via the occupier, * Losses as a result of ransack exploitation of the economy and slave labour of the populous. In 1947, the postwar Bureau of Reparations during the Presidium of the Council of Ministers (Sprawozdanie Biura Odszkodowa≈Ñ Wojennych w przedmiocie strat i szk√≥d wojennych Polski 1939‚Äì1945) assessed loss of life, national capital and culture: * Loss of national capital - 38% in relation to the pre-1939 state (the greatest destruction by the occupant was in the scope of industry and urban areas). * Loss of property - residential buildings (162 190), agricultural granges (353 876), factories and industrial complexes (14 000), private sector and state shops (199 751), workshops (84 436), 968 223 households. * Destruction of urban areas and towns - war losses of Warsaw - 85% of the city matter, 90% of industry, 72% of housing, 90% of cultural and landmarks, 700 000 deaths (i.e. the United Kingdom and American wartime population loss combined). Total destruction and loot of the Warsaw Ghetto in 1943, 95% loss, Jas≈Ço (96%) and the destruction of the Port of Gdynia. * Loot of cultural artifacts - 43% en masse. Destructtion of 25 museums, 35 theatres, 665 cinemas, 323 community centres. Although it is difficult to estimate museum losses, library losses amount to 66%. The irreversible destruction of 22 mil. books. Collectively, the German occupant ransacked 516 000 individual pieces of art, with an estimated worth of 15,46 bil. U.S. Dollars (2017 rate). Due to postwar vindication, only a small fragment of cultural artifacts, works of art and exhibits were recovered. * Loss in Polish education - destruction of 17 institutes of higher education, 271 secondary schools, 4880 common schools and 768 other schools. Additionally, the destruction of research institutes, scientific societies and other types of foundations. * Loss of healthcare services (hospital properties, infrastructure, buildings) - 55% in relation to the pre-1939 state. Destruction of 352 hospitals, 29 anti- tuberculosis sanatoriums, 47 insurance societies, 778 health centres and out- patients' clinics, 1450 doctor and dental clinics. * Loss in industry (purposeful destruction and loot of machines and appliances) - 64.5% of chemical, 64.3% of printing, 59.7% of electro-technical, 55.4% of clothing, 53.1% of food and 48.0% of metal industry pillaged or looted. * Loss in forestry as a result of the seizure of national capital - 75 mil. m¬≥ of trees cut down, equating to 400 000 hectares of forest. * Loss in agriculture and cultivation - 1908 thousand horses, 3905 thousand cattle, 4988 thousand swine and 755 thousand sheep. * Destruction of over 50% of railway, road, sea and air transport infrastructure. Destruction of telecommunications infrastructure (destruction of 13 radio reception stations, 7 radio telegraph stations, confiscation of 867 000 radio receivers). The loot or destruction of 2465 locomotives, 6250 rail carriages, 83 636 rail transport wagons, 25 sea ships and 39 close-shore port ships. The destruction of 5948 km of railway tracks, 47 767 metres of railway bridges and viaducts, 14 900 km of hard-surface roads, 15 500 km of road bridges. The Bureau of Reparations during the Presidium of the Council of Ministers estimated the total cost of material losses amounted after the end of World War II that took place between 1939 and 1945. Conclusively, the material losses and destruction was valued at 258 billion prewar Z≈Çoty, which amount to 50 billion U.S. Dollars (1939 rate). In relation to the 2017, the aforesaid U.S. Dollar transfers to $850‚Äì920 billion U.S. Dollars. As such, Poland's capital city of Warsaw suffered $60 billion U.S. Dollars in war losses. Material losses under Soviet occupation In September, 1939 the Soviet Union occupied the eastern voivodeships of Poland. During World War II, the occupied territory was annexed and ceded to the Soviet republic of: Ukrainian SSR, Byelorussian SSR and the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic. The annexation of this part of Poland was accepted at the Tehran and Yalta Conference. As a result, under the pressure of world powers, Poland was forced to cede the Soviet Union 48% of its territory, equating to the loss of 178,000 km¬≤ of land, gaining the equivalent of 101 000 km¬≤ in the west. The modification of Poland's borders by the United Kingdom and the United States of America was a direct violation of the Atlantic Charter. After World War II, the Polish state did not assess the material losses incited by the USSR on Polish territory between 1939 and 1945. Due to the de facto occupation of Poland by the Soviet Union, the Bureau of Reparations during the Presidium of the Council of Ministers (Sprawozdanie Biura Odszkodowa≈Ñ Wojennych w przedmiocie strat i szk√≥d wojennych Polski 1939‚Äì1945) did not take these losses into consideration. Loss of intelligentsia In concentration camps, 135 higher education employees were killed, 80 in the Warsaw Uprising, 163 scientists in public executions (including 67 in Warsaw and 52 in Lw√≥w), and 44 intellectuals in the Katy≈Ñ Massacre. In respect to the largest intellectual centres in Poland, the largest losses were found in Warsaw - 276 taughts intellects, Krak√≥w - 114, Pozna≈Ñ - 102, Lw√≥w - 95 and in Wilno, 27 scientists.

FAFEN has earned an excellent reputation among various stakeholders, including the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) and has been recognized as an authentic organization among political parties, civil society organizations, international community, academia, and the media. After the General Elections 2013 various political parties levelled multiple charges of rigging, on which the Supreme Court of Pakistan had formed a Judicial Commission to investigate the matter. FAFEN was the only civil society organization, which was summoned by the Supreme Court of Pakistan to share its election observation findings. Citizens‚Äô Observation for Electoral Transparency FAFEN has trained and mobilized hundreds and thousands of citizens to observe various processes of elections in Pakistan.https://fafen.org/about-fafen/key-achievements/ During elections, the trained and non-partisan citizen election observers report back various processes of the election on a specified format. These remarkable men and women brave security odds, scorching temperatures and rugged terrains to provide objective and independent information about the quality of the electoral process to the Pakistani citizens as well as the international community. General Elections 2008 To observe the General Elections 2008, FAFEN began training long-term observer coordinators in 264 (out of 272) National Assembly constituencies in September 2007. FAFEN's observation of February 18, 2008 general election was helped by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) which accredited 20,000 domestic national election observers to observe all processes of the election all over the country. The Network's strategy was for 16,000 paired stationary observers to monitor a random sample of about 8,000 (out of 64,000) polling stations all day, collecting detailed information about voting, counting, and compilation of results. On the Election-Day, thousands of Pakistani men and women observed female and male polling booths and stations using a tailored manual and reporting format. An additional 4,000 mobile observers visited as many as 30,000 polling stations, making the 2008 national and provincial assembly elections the most closely watched in Pakistani history, despite widespread security concerns and enormous logistical obstacles. Gilgit-Baltistan Legislative Assembly (GBLA) Elections 2009 FAFEN observed Gilgit-Baltistan Legislative Assembly (GBLA) on November 12, 2009, that was characterized by weak electoral administration, procedural irregularities, erroneous voter lists, and heavy government interference. The competitive election campaign, however, offered fairly equal opportunities to all political and independent contestants. FAFEN deployed 22 trained constituency coordinators and 150 Election-Day observers to observe the Gilgit-Baltistan polls. Trained FAFEN observers visited more than 600 of 1,022 polling stations (59%) to observe the voting and counting processes on the Election-Day. General Elections 2013 FAFEN observed General Elections 2013 with more than 40,000 citizen observers and issued three short statements on the Election-Day, May 11, and a preliminary statement and report the day after the elections. FAFEN's final analysis was based on the aggregation of comprehensive checklists filled by hand on Election-Day in a statistically-valid random sample of 9,160 polling stations by more than 25,000 static observers and about 15,000 additional mobile observers each visiting two to four polling stations. FAFEN's final analysis also depended on the extent to which the Election Commission of Pakistan transparently released official forms from all 69,801 polling stations and all 272 National Assembly (NA) constituencies across Pakistan, as urged by both FAFEN and the European Union Election Observation Mission (EUEOM) in public statements.

Local Government Elections 2015 The Election Commission of Pakistan established a total of 63,860 polling stations for the Local Government elections 2015 in Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Punjab and Sindh. FAFEN was able to observe 14,050 (22 percent) of these polling stations ‚Äì 8,318 in Punjab, 3,212 in Sindh, 2,334 in KP and 186 in ICT. The observers recorded 139,127 irregularities and illegalities in the observed polling stations ‚Äì averaging 10 violations per polling station. The scope of observation was divided into themes and distinct indicators. General Election 2018 More than 16,000 citizen observers were the true expression of the will of Pakistani people to protect the integrity of elections and strengthen democracy on July 25, 2018, when the country held its 11th General Election (GE) in a politically fragmented environment.https://nation.com.pk/27-Jul-2018/fafen-expresses-satisfaction- over-election- processhttps://www.thenews.com.pk/print/403540-elections-2018-fafen-report- finds-various-irregularities FAFEN deployed trained, non-partisan citizen observers to observe voting and counting processes at 85% (or 72,089) of all polling stations in 272 National Assembly constituencies ‚Äì an unparalleled effort to deter electoral fraud and generate independent information on the quality of election. The observation also enabled a better understanding of citizens of otherwise complex electoral processes and procedures and help them form independent opinions about the electoral outcomes as the country witnessed the second consecutive peaceful democratic transition of power. GE-2018 was unique as it was the first time a legal provision protected the rights of domestic and international observers to have access to polling stations, counting of votes and consolidation of election results ‚Äì a point of advocacy that FAFEN held since General Elections in 2008. The electoral reforms enacted in 2017 translated into a more responsive Election Commission of Pakistan, which unlike previous elections, efficiently processed accreditation of FAFEN observers.https://tribune.com.pk/story/1767487/1-voter- turnout-stood-55-8-per-cent-says-ecp/https://dailytimes.com.pk/274109/fafen- finds-2018-election-better-managed-than-2013/ It was FAFEN's observers who raised alarm bells from 80 neighborhoods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, Punjab and Sindh where women were being barred from participating in the election process as well as voting. Timely reporting by FAFEN prompted ECP to take immediate actions in these areas to ensure women were allowed to vote. A small step forward but the GE-2018 did not have any incident of 0% percent turnout at any female polling stations unlike 2013 when there were 595 polling stations and 564 in 2008 where no women turned out to vote. This was one of several meaningful remedial actions that ECP had initiated on FAFEN's reporting, establishing the efficacy of the coordination mechanism that was specially set up by the Election Commission of Pakistan for FAFEN to share its observation findings and reports.https://www.dawn.com/news/1423611https://www.dawn.com/news/1449771https://www.orfonline.org/research/pakistan- general-elections-2018-analysis-of-results-and- implications-46324/https://tribune.com.pk/story/1772810/1-ballots-excluded- count-2018-rejected-2013-elections/https://tribune.com.pk/story/1782675/1-24-newly- elected-mnas-matriculate-fafen/ FAFEN's Election-Day observation was particularly significant in terms of contributing to political stability after most political parties raised concerns at the result management process, alleging that the election outcomes were rigged. The pre-election and election-day reports did not only quantify the scale of irregularities but also indicated their material effect on the election outcome, shifting the focus of divisive political discourse from generalized statements on the quality of election to more technical areas that needed greater scrutiny.

Through this application, TDEA - FAFEN received the observation data from 37,001 out of 85,000 polling stations from across the country on election day. Open Parliament Portal Trust for Democratic Education and Accountability - Free and Fair Election Network has been observing the proceedings of the National Assembly and Senate since 2008 and all Provincial Legislatures since 2011. Every sitting of Lower and Upper Houses of Parliament is directly observed, with objective observation data disseminated among relevant stakeholders in the form of daily factsheets (produced within two hours after the end of each sitting), analytical reports, press releases and recommendations to improve parliamentary processes. Trust for Democratic Education and Accountability - FAFEN follows the same methodology for the legislatures of Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Balochistan. In order to share the huge observation data set with the public, TDEA - FAFEN has designed an online portal called ‚ÄúOpenParliament.pk‚Äù. The website covers all facets of legislative information, including data about the past and ongoing proceedings of each assembly, as well as performance scorecards and reported assets and liabilities of national and provincial elected representatives. Legislative Governance The Free and Fair Election Network (FAFEN) has been conducting unique parliamentary observation since 2008, bridging the gap between elected Houses and citizens to inculcate an informed public and political discourse on various aspects of legislative governance in Pakistan. The observation tools and methodology, which were piloted in the National Assembly (Lower House of the national parliament) in 2008, was scaled up to cover the Senate (Upper House of the national parliament) in 2011 and Provincial Assemblies of all provinces in 2012. FAFEN's systematic observation of on-floor proceedings of the elected Houses assesses their performance on the parameters of Participation, Output, Representation, Responsiveness, Transparency, Accessibility, and Order & Institutionalization. Based on the respective rules of business and procedures of each elected House, the observation checklists have been designed in a way that helps generate quantitative information as the level of participation (both in terms of time and quality) of legislators and quantities information is being taken up in the form of motions, resolutions and other interjections. The systematic observation allows the generation of daily, sessional, annual and thematic reports as well as performance scorecards of 1,174 legislators on Open Parliament web portal (www.openparliament.pk). The repository includes profiles and performance details of 104 Senators, 342 Members of National Assembly (MNAs) and 728 Members of four Provincial Assemblies (MPAs) along with their nomination papers and Statements of Assets and Liabilities submitted to the Election Commission of Pakistan. The observation information, available on the Open Parliament web portal, enables citizens, media, civil society, and other relevant stakeholders to access and appraise the performance of elected bodies and their representatives.

Designed by George Julian Zolnay, it was commissioned by the Frank Cheatham Bivouac of the United Confederate Veterans in 1903, laid with Masonic honors in 1907, and dedicated in 1909. It was vandalized in June 2019. Description The monument consists of a statue of a Confederate private in a uniform with a rifle. According to the Smithsonian Institution, the private is Sam Davis (although newspaper articles published at the time do not mention him). The Smithsonian adds, \\"The butt of the rifle rests on the rocky stone ledge on which Davis is seated. He faces forward with his proper left hand resting between his knees. Davis is seated on a rough-cut stone atop a tapering base.\\" The monument includes a plaque with the names of 540 members of the Frank Cheatham Bivouac. History Theodore Cooley, a member of the Frank Cheatham Bivouac of the United Confederate Veterans, suggested commissioning a monument in 1902. By 1903, he assembled a group of Confederate veterans to work on the project, and they hired sculptor George Julian Zolnay, who had designed many other Confederate sculptures, to do it. When Cooley died, Major B. M. Hord became the chairman of the committee. The monument cost $4,000 to build. Zolnay donated $500; the Frank Cheatham Bivouac of the United Confederate Veterans raised $1000, the United Daughters of the Confederacy raised more than $1,000, and the rest was covered by smaller donors. By 1907, the cornerstone was \\"laid with Masonic honors by the Grand Lodge of the State.\\" The monument also includes a plaque with the names of 540 members of the Frank Cheatham Bivouac. The monument was dedicated in Centennial Park on June 19, 1909. Henry Watterson gave a speech that celebrated Tennessee for having the courage to leave the Union and stated \\"Greece had its Marathon; let Shiloh, Murfreesboro and Chichamauga tell the story of Tennessee.\\" Zolnay gave a speech in front of the crowd highlighting that his wife was a Southerner, and Judge S. F. Wilson gave another speech about the fighting spirit of the private soldier in the CSA. It was \\"unveiled in the presence of an immense crowd of people,\\" to the sound of \\"Dixie\\". In a speech, Henry Watterson combined a veneration of Southern glory with a consecration of the dead to the reconciliation of the living. Although he emphasized divine will, he differed from other United Confederate Veteran speakers in that he depicted God sacrificing the men of both sections to a new Union. Through veneration of things memorable, magnificent, and courageous, he aroused feelings of pride, patriotism, and loyalty to the new Union. In appealing to things memorable, he transferred elements of the Gospels to Southern history to heighten the sense of divine destiny in reconciliation. He recounted the magnificence and courage of Tennesseans to highlight their conduct in war and their conciliatory spirit in peace.Henry Watterson, A Study of Selected Speeches on Reconciliation in the Post-Bellum Period Vandalism The statue was vandalized with red paint on June 17, 2019. The vandal(s) also painted \\"THEY WERE RACISTS\\" on the plaque with the names of the 540 Confederate veterans. At the time when the monument was installed, Tennessee had legal racial segregation in public schools, parks and other facilities. African Americans were forbidden to use the public pool at Centennial Park. Twenty-first century opponents of maintaining Confederate monuments have noted the white supremacy of such post-Reconstruction history as part of the context of the installation of the monuments and say they should be removed from public places.

Mary and Henry had several children including James Foster. Henry Foster died in 1793. The family home from the time of Gabriel Bradley was situated on the High Street in Stourbridge. Gabriel had also owned Stourbridge Forge as well as an anvil shop, warehouses and various other buildings. Career John Bradley founded the firm of John Bradley & Co in 1800, taking a lease on land next to the canal at Stourbridge with the aim of constructing an ironworks. In 1802 a deed of co-partnership was drawn up between John Bradley, the businessman Thomas Jukes Collier, and the trustees of the estate of the late Henry Foster. By this time the company had constructed a slitting and rolling mill and a forge at the site. In 1807, John's half-brothers James and William Foster became equal partners in the company. In 1809, the company took a lease on a forge at Eardington. In 1813, William Foster left the partnership so that John Bradley and James Foster became equal partners. Family life John Bradley was married in 1799 to Priscilla, the eldest daughter of Bate Richards of Stourbidge, and together they had six children. Death John Bradley's death on 13 January 1816, left James Foster in control of the company, which subsequently expanded, acquiring new sites in the Black Country and in Shropshire. John's sole surviving son, Henry Bradley, joined John Bradley & Co as a partner in 1827 but left the company some ten years later.

It was first established in July 1870 in the British Raj's Gilgit Agency, where it came to be known as \\"Hayward's Garden\\" in memory of late British explorer George W. Hayward, who was the first person to be laid to rest there. Before this, it was known as the Jawahir Singh Bagh () during the Dogra Raj. Location The graveyard is compounded on one side that is towards the main road, and fenced with barbed wire. It is located near Shahi Pologround, found along Khazana Road in the direction of Barmas. The cemetery is also a foreign tourist attraction. History In July 1870, during his journey to explore the Pamir Mountains, famous British explorer Lt. George W. Hayward was allegedly murdered by a local tribesman near the Darkot Pass in Ghizer (then part of a princely state). The following morning, he was discovered dead under the shade of a tree. On 18 July 1870, his dead body was brought to Gilgit and buried in an orchard. With time, the orchard received more burials and subsequently became a regulated place of burial for British nationals. The location of the cemetery underwent various name changes throughout history, such as Hayward Garden, Christian Cemetery and Jawahir Singh Bagh. The cemetery was renovated in 2002 by the Pakistani government with full sponsorship from the United Kingdom. Buried The cemetery contains 18 graves and among the buried are explorer Lt. George Hayward, political agents Maj. Arthur Francis and Lt. Henry Gordon Bell as well as various tourists and travellers who died during their stay in the region before the agency's dissolution.

She saw service in both world wars, being the most successful vessel in her class of four ships. Like her three sisters, she was initially built as a river monitor, but in early 1918, she was converted to a sea-going monitor. During the Second Balkan war, she supported the Romanian crossing of the Danube into Bulgaria. During World War I, she carried out numerous bombardments against the Central Powers forces advancing along the shore of the Danube and carried out the last action of the Romanian Navy before the 11 November 1918 armistice. She later fought successfully against Bolshevik naval forces during the early months of the Russian Civil War, helping secure the Budjak region. During the interwar period, she contributed to the suppression of the Tatarbunary Uprising and was rearmed with longer main guns towards the end of the 1930s. During World War II, she fought several engagements against the Soviet Navy in the first month of the Eastern Front, but was ultimately sunk by Soviet aircraft shortly after Romania ceased hostilities against the Soviet Union, on 24 August 1944. Construction and specifications Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu was part of a class of four river monitors built in Austria- Hungary for the Romanian Navy (four more ships of this class were planned but not laid down). Like her three sisters, she was built in sections at STT in Austria-Hungary in 1907. Her sections were then transported to the Gala»õi shipyard in Romania, where she was assembled and launched. Her standard displacement amounted to 680 tons, increasing to 750 tons when fully loaded. She measured 63.5 meters in length, with a beam of 10.3 meters and a draught of 1.6 meters. Her power plant consisted of two engines and two Yarrow boilers powering two shafts, generating a total of 1,800 hp which gave her a top speed of 13 knots. She had a crew of 110 and a range of 1,500 nautical miles at a speed of 9.7 knots. Her armor thickness reached 70‚Äì75 mm on the belt, deck, turrets and conning tower. Her armament during World War I consisted of three 120 mm ≈†koda naval guns in independent armored turrets, one 120 mm ≈†koda naval howitzer, four 47 mm ≈†koda naval guns and two 6.5 mm Romanian-made Maxim machine guns. She was modernized in 1937‚Äì1938, her three 120 mm ≈†koda guns being replaced by three longer 120 mm ≈†koda-Bofors naval guns. During World War II, she was armed with three 120 mm ≈†koda-Bofors naval guns, one 76 mm anti-aircraft gun, two 47 mm ≈†koda naval guns and two machine guns. She and her three sisters were also fitted for service at sea as anti-submarine escorts, each one of them being armed with two depth charge throwers (one of 700 mm and one of 760 mm).Robert Gardiner, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906‚Äì1921, Naval Institute Press, 1985, p. 422Marian S√¢rbu, Marina rom√¢n√¢ √Æn primul rƒÉzboi mondial 1914‚Äì1918, Editura Academiei Navale Mircea cel BƒÉtr√¢n, 2002, p. 144–ï. –ï. –®–≤–µ–¥–µ, –í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ —Ñ–ª–æ—Ç—ã 1939‚Äì1940 –≥–≥., –†–∏–ø–æ–ª –ö–ª–∞—Å—Å–∏–∫, 2013, pp. 120‚Äì121 (in Russian)ION C.

Her bow was fitted with a breakwater, the distribution of her inner cargo was evened to prevent listing, her deck was made waterproof and more instruments required for sea navigation were brought from the cruiser Elisabeta. By the beginning of March 1918, the monitor was ready to sail at sea.Raymond StƒÉnescu, Cristian CrƒÉciunoiu, Marina rom√¢nƒÉ √Æn primul rƒÉzboi mondial, Modelism Publishing, 2000 p. 271 (in Romanian) Her three sisters (Alexandru Lahovari, Ion C.

The four warships kept Bulgarian and German ground forces under a powerful and accurate barrage of fire, allowing thousands of Romanian troops to escape the encircled city. She was especially active in the last two days of the battle, 5 and 6 September 1916.Raymond StƒÉnescu, Cristian CrƒÉciunoiu, Marina rom√¢nƒÉ √Æn primul rƒÉzboi mondial, Modelism Publishing, 2000, pp. 91‚Äì93 The Romanian monitors contributed significantly to the Romanian- Russian victory during the First Battle of Cobadin. As a consequence of this and previous actions at Turtucaia and elsewhere, German General August von Mackensen decided to eliminate the Romanian monitors. He delegated 7 artillery officers, possessing guns with calibers ranging from 150 mm to 305 mm, to attack and destroy the monitors as they were travelling between Rasova and Oltina on 21 September. The German batteries fired with intensity, but by the end of the day, all that was achieved was minor damage to one of her sisters, the monitor Alexandru Lahovari, which also had 6 wounded. When a German aircraft reported at the end of the day that none of the monitors had been sunk, Mackensen dismissed all 7 officers.Raymond StƒÉnescu, Cristian CrƒÉciunoiu, Marina rom√¢nƒÉ √Æn primul rƒÉzboi mondial, Modelism Publishing, 2000, pp. 113‚Äì117 (in Romanian) At the start of October, rumors about approaching Romanian river monitors caused the Austro-Hungarian naval forces to retreat, thus putting an end to the Battle of FlƒÉm√¢nda.Michael B. Barrett, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, Indiana University Press, 2013, p. 143 In December, she and the rest of the Romanian Danube Flotilla retreated to the Danube Delta, in the aftermath of a Central Powers offensive that conquered almost all of Southern Romania. On 21 December, she and one of her sisters supported a Russian advance against the Bulgarian lines. The two warships fired a powerful barrage of fire against the Bulgarian-occupied villages of Cerna and Piatra Ro»ôie, and the German-occupied Satul Nou. Under intense fire from the Romanian monitors, the Bulgarians temporarily retreated, but soon returned to their positions after the Russians failed to take the offensive. In the last days of 1916, Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu was at Ismail, covering the vessels which were ferrying the Russians North across the Chilia branch.Raymond StƒÉnescu, Cristian CrƒÉciunoiu, Marina rom√¢nƒÉ √Æn primul rƒÉzboi mondial, Modelism Publishing, 2000, pp. 175‚Äì181 (in Romanian) After a winter of relative inactivity, the Romanian Navy took some defensive measures as well as performing warship upgrades, the monitors being fitted to fire French 120 mm rounds, which gave their main guns a range of up to 11 km. In July 1917, the Romanian monitors took part in an intense bombardment of Bulgarian-occupied Tulcea. The bombardment caused significant losses, and the monitors fired until all enemy artillery batteries in and around the city were silenced, suffering light damage themselves. The bombardment lasted several days, and on the last day, 26 July, Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu was struck and damaged by a howitzer shell. She had no casualties, but this for her was the baptism of fire.Raymond StƒÉnescu, Cristian CrƒÉciunoiu, Marina rom√¢nƒÉ √Æn primul rƒÉzboi mondial, Modelism Publishing, 2000, pp. 204‚Äì215 (in Romanian) She carried out the last action of the Romanian Navy during the war, which took place after Romania re-declared war on the Central Powers on 10 November 1918. In the morning of 11 November, three hours before the Allied Armistice with Germany was signed, the monitor, together with the 30-ton river torpedo boat Trotu»ôul, occupied the port of BrƒÉila, after the Germans retreated from the city. The two Romanian warships captured 77 assorted German vessels abandoned in the city's port (barges, tankers, tugs, floating cranes, motorboats).Raymond StƒÉnescu, Cristian CrƒÉciunoiu, Marina rom√¢nƒÉ √Æn primul rƒÉzboi mondial, Modelism Publishing, 2000, p. 251 (in Romanian) Interwar In 1924, Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu took part in the suppression of the Tatarbunary uprising, along with other warships of the Romanian Navy. The Romanian vessels captured at Periprava numerous rebels as well as significant quantities of weapons and munitions.Ludmila Rotari, Mi»ôcarea SubversivƒÉ √Æn Basarabia 1918‚Äì1924, Enciclopedica Publishing, 2004, p. 245 (in Romanian) Notably, in the late 1930s, she was commanded by Horia Macellariu, who would become a Rear Admiral and the commander of the Romanian Black Sea Fleet in 1943.Horia Macellariu, Ioana Maria Ionescu, √én plin uragan ‚Äì Amintirle mele, Saggitarius publishing, 1998 World War II Naval engagements Eastern FrontNavypedia: UDARNYY river monitor (project SB-12) (1934) When Romania joined the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu was the flagship of the Tulcea Tactical Group, a formation of warships defending the coast of the Danube Delta from Soviet naval attacks. On 23 June and 13 July, Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu engaged and repelled the same Soviet monitor, damaging her in both encounters. The Soviet monitor was thus rendered mostly inactive until the Soviet Fleet withdrew from the area in late July. On 14 July, near Ismail, Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu engaged the most powerful Soviet monitor, Udarnyy. The ensuing exchange of fire was fierce, but eventually, Udarnyy was struck and damaged, being forced to retreat. It is possible that Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu also damaged one Soviet armored motor gunboat. On 17 July, she attacked and dispersed a group of Soviet warships at Ismail, possibly sinking one barge. She also shot down one Soviet aircraft, on 29 June.Jipa Rotaru, Ioan Damaschin, Glorie »ôi dramƒÉ: Marina RegalƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ, 1940‚Äì1945, Ion Cristoiu Publishing, 2000, pp. 57, 58, 87 and 88 (in Romanian)Jonathan Trigg, Death on the Don: The Destruction of Germany's Allies on the Eastern Front, History Press Limited, 2017 Chapter 3 Support of ground operations On 24 June, she attacked the Soviet bridgehead at Ceatalchioi.

Wallis Myers (in his book Lawn Tennis At Home and Abroad in 1903) said \\"He is essentially a baseline player and, volleying only on the rarest of occasions and with a somewhat indifferent service, relies almost entirely on a low forehand drive on which he gets a lot of top.\\" At his first Wimbledon in 1895, Flavelle lost in the quarter finals to Ernest Meers. At Wimbledon 1898 he lost in the quarter finals to Laurence Doherty, though he did win a set.. Flavelle reached the Wimbledon last 16 in 1906 (beating George Simond before losing to Sydney Smith).

He is known as one of the foremost Spanish Jesuits of his day and as a leading representative of post-Su√°rezian baroque Jesuit nominalism.  Life  Born in 1592, at Logro√±o in Castile, he joined the Society of Jesus on September 17, 1606, when he was 14 years old. He studied philosophy and theology under Pedro Hurtado de Mendoza. He taught philosophy (1620‚Äì1623) and theology (1624) in Valladolid and theology in Salamanca (1624‚Äì1625). Having learned from the letters of the general of the order that it would be for the greater glory of God if some Spanish Jesuits went to Bohemia to teach the most advanced subjects, he volunteered for this employment. He arrived in Prague in 1625. Arriaga taught theology in Prague from 1626 to 1637. Subsequently, he served as dean of the theology faculty in 1637‚Äì1642, and again in 1654‚Äì1667. He solemnly received the degree of Doctor of Theology, and he gained a wide reputation. The province of Bohemia three times made him a deputy to Rome to attend the general congregations of the order there. He was highly esteemed by Urban VIII, Innocent X, and the Emperor Ferdinand III. He died in Prague on June 17, 1667. Arriaga published two works: # Cursus Philosophicus, Antwerp, 1632; Paris, 1637, 1639; Lyon, 1644, 1647, 1653, 1659, 1669, (described as an augmented edition), all in folio; # Disputationes Theologicae in Summam Divi Thomae, a work of which the author published eight folio volumes, and was composing a ninth at the time of his death. This ponderous series of dissertations on Thomas Aquinas was published in successive volumes as follows: vols. I and II Disputationes in Primam Partem, Antwerp, 1643; Lyon, 1644, 1669; vols. III and IV Disputationes in Primam Secundae, Antwerp, 1644; Lyon, 1669; vol. V Disputationes in Secundam Secundae, Antwerp, 1649; Lyon 1651; vols. VI, VII and VIII Disputationes in Tertiam Partem, Antwerp, 1650-55; Lyon, 1654-1669 Nicol√°s Antonio attributes to Arriaga two other works: # De Oratore Libri Quatuor, Cologne, 8vo. In all likelihood this is an edition of the Rhetor Christianus of Pablo Jos√© Arriaga; # Brevis Expositio Literae Magistri Sententiarum, published, besides previous editions, at Lyon, 1636, 8vo. This work likewise is supposed to be wrongly assigned to Rodrigo de Arriaga. During Arriaga's own lifetime his reputation was very high, not only in Spain, but in the country where he spent the long period of his self-imposed exile. So great was his intellectual authority and his fame as a teacher that he was the subject of a popular quip: \\"Pragam videre, Arriagam audire\\"‚Äî\\"To see Prague, to hear Arriaga\\".. His name has now become very obscure; but it still maintains a place in the history of philosophy. Among the abortive attempts which were made in the course of the seventeenth century, principally by the religious orders in Spain, to resuscitate the philosophy of the schoolmen, the Cursus Philosophicus of Arriaga, scholastic alike in contents, in arrangement, and in form, was one of the most skilful. Even a cursory inspection of the work shows its author to have been a man of great acuteness and subtlety, and of praiseworthy candour. The position which he occupies in the annals of speculative philosophy has been indicated by Morhof and Bayle, whose view is adopted by Brucker, and is fully supported by the tenor of Arriaga's writings. He had studied with attention the recent writings of the anti-Aristotelians; and, giving effect to many of the opinions advanced by them, he endeavoured by modifications and concessions to adapt to modern use the logic and metaphysics, but still more the physical hypotheses, of his scholastic masters. It seems to be admitted, that in this attempt at compromise he went farther than any of the scholastic philosophers of his time. His modern critics lament the misapplication of the fine qualities which his mind evidently possessed. In his own day, as a Jesuit teaching the doctrines then approved by his order, he was indeed safe from any serious charge of heterodoxy; but his position as a partial innovator laid him open to many attacks from the uncompromising adherents of the old philosophical systems. The Platonist, Jan Marek Marci in his Philosophia Vetus Restituta, seized upon Arriaga's concessions as proving the unsoundness of the foundations upon which the Aristotelian philosophy rests. In other quarters he was openly denounced as a sceptic, and accused of wilfully suppressing or weakening the answers to plausible objections against the system which he professed to teach. This charge, unwarranted by any real design on the part of Arriaga, was founded upon his usual method of exposition; for, after laying down his proposition, he discusses successively all the powerful objections to it, to many of which (as might be expected in a modern defence of the scholastic philosophy) he makes answers which are far from being satisfactory.  Influence  Cursus philosophicus, Lyon, 1669 Very innovative in metaphysics and natural philosophy (he defended heliocentrism despite the ecclesiastical prohibitions), Arriaga rejected the ontological argument, denying the possibility of demonstrating a priori the existence of God. Regarding the structure of the universe, he accepted the fluid nature of planetary space, though he rejected the arguments from astronomical observations. While the Revisers General attempted to enforce uniformity within the Society, Arriaga called for greater liberty in philosophy. In the preface of the first edition of his Cursus Philosophicus (1632) Arriaga argued explicitly in favour of new opinions. Was there not just as much genius in Thomas, Cajetan, Molina, and Su√†rez as in the ancients?That is, the medieval Doctor Angelicus St. Thomas Aquinas, O.P. (1224/25-1274) and the leading figures of the sixteenth-century scholastic revival Cardinal Cajetan (Tommaso de Vio, O.P., 1468/69?-1534), Luis de Molina, S.J., (1535-1600), and the Doctor Eximius Francisco Su√†rez, S.J. (1548-1617). Since we have studied much since the ancients, he wondered, \\"why then is it not proper for us to deduce new conclusions?\\"\\". . . cur ergo & nobis non licet conseqentias novas deducere?\\" Roderigo de Arriaga, Cursus Philosophicus (Antwerp, 1632) \\"Praefatio ad Lectorem.\\" Antiquity was no guarantee of the truth of any opinion, for in his view it was truly amazing how many ancient opinions had virtually no foundation but were based simply on the badly understood authority of Aristotle or some other philosopher.Hellyer, Marcus. 2003. ‚ÄúThe Construction of the Ordinatio pro studiis superioribus of 1651.‚Äù Archivum Historicum Societatis Iesu, 72: 7. Arriaga therefore, gave up most of the received opinions of the Schools in points of natural philosophy, such as the composition of the continuum, rarefaction, etc. and undertook to defend the innovators in philosophy. In his Dictionnaire Historique et Critique, Pierre Bayle praises him as one of the greatest academics of his time. Arriaga exerted a strong influence on the Czech physician Jan Marek Marci, on the Italian scholar Valeriano Magni and on the Spanish philosopher and scientist Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz. The German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz used his works extensively. It can also be assumed that Descartes's treatment of the problems of rarefaction and condensation (Principia II, 5-6) is influenced by Arriaga. His work was, however, sometimes controversial. Arriaga was accused of supporting the Zenonist doctrine of quantity. This doctrine, which asserted that quantity consisted of points, had been repeatedly and strenuously rejected by the revisers general as incompatible with the orthodox account of Eucharist. In a letter from General Vincenzo Carafa, Arriaga was named as the source of the diffusion of this doctrine in Germany. The text in question was doubtless his philosophy textbook, Cursus philosophicus, which enjoyed wide circulation throughout the German Province of the Society of Jesus.

It contains alkaloids that are useful in pharmaceuticals. It is used locally as a painkiller and a recreational drug. In high dosages it can be fatal. General Hyoscyamus muticus, commonly known as Egyptian henbane, is native to Sub-Saharan Africa from Mauritania to Sudan and is also found in Saudi Arabia and the eastern Mediterranean. It grows in arid rocky localities, wadis and plains. The wild plants are used in traditional local medicine. It is sometimes cultivated in countries such as Egypt, Pakistan and India for its medicinal alkaloids, which may be exported to countries such as Germany. Ernest Ayscoghe Floyer (1852‚Äì1903) successfully cultivated Hyoscyamus muticus to obtain the alkaloid hyoscyamine. Description Egyptian henbane is a perennial herb or shrub with a height of up to . It is a stout succulent, with long stems that have many branches in their upper parts. The lower leaves are broad, while the upper leaves are narrower. The flowers are formed in dense inflorescences up to long. They have white or green corolla and upper lips in deep purple-violet. The fruit is a capsule. Medical effects The leaves are high in alkaloids including scopolamine, which is used in pharmaceuticals. When released slowly, scopolamine reduces the nausea of motion sickness or post-operative recovery. In eye drops it dilates the pupils and paralyzes the focusing muscles, which is useful in optical surgery. The roasted seeds are used to make an intoxicating drink, and the leaves are smoked for their intoxicating effect, and to relive the symptoms of asthma. The leaves may also be applied as a poultice to relieve pain. The plant is toxic in higher doses, and deaths have been reported from eating locusts that had eaten Egyptian henbane. The Tuareg people use it as a fish poison. An overdose causes symptoms such as an extremely dry throat, constipation, a rapid pulse, blurred vision, excitement, hallucinations, delirium and death. The wives of the Roman emperors Augustus and Claudius used the plant as a poison to eliminate rivals. In February 1881 the survivors of the Flatters Expedition were approached by a group of Tuaregs who sold them milk, meat and dates at a high price. The dates turned out to be poisoned with a substance that caused dizziness and psychosis. This came from the plant called Falezlez by the Tuaregs and El Bettina by the Arabs (Hyoscyamus falezlez). The effect was to induce a burning sensation in the victims' lungs, and to cause them to rush about madly and fire off their guns.

It is open once a month, only on last Sundays, with two guided tours in the morning.  History  The graveyard was built in 1777 outside the San Frediano gate and remained in operation until 1870, when a new one was opened in Caciolle, in the Rifredi area. The site is of historical and artistic interest for the tombs (the oldest date back to the 18th century), surrounded by multi-storey houses, which somewhat depict the decadent and romantic charm. The part on the left of the entrance was expropriated by the Commune to erect a dispensary, today asylum: there were tombs of the 18th century, which on that occasion were dismantled and recompiled to the best and best in the area near the entrance, with some inscriptions mounted. No grave has the image of the deceased, according to Jewish custom.  Monumental tombs  left Jewish culture, in accordance with rigid biblical teaching, does not appreciate the idea of glamor and wealth, so monumental tombs are usually very rare. There are only three in this cemetery, lined up along the central avenue with cypresses and dating back to the period after the unification of Italy, when the Kingdom was excommunicated by Pope Pius IX and religious minorities were able to enjoy a tolerant climate. The first of the Levi family has a pyramidal shape that recalls the Egyptian tombs with references to the symbolic tradition of French Enlightenment: the triangle seen as a perfect figure that pervades perfection. The pyramid is placed on a tall base, made of squared blocks of stone and illuminated inside by a small eye on the south side, as well as from the entrance door. The latter is crowned by a triangular pediment and the family coat of arms. In the cell are still visible twisted crowns of flowers and leaves, probably left there by the original funeral ritual. The second chapel, next to the pyramid, is smaller and even inspired by the neo- gestic style. It belonged to the Servadio family and was executed around 1875. It has beam columns and inside the sculpted symbol of winged sun; on the underlying sarcophagus a crown is carved. The coat of arms is on the stand. Today the exterior of the chapel is largely hidden by vegetation. The third chapel of the Franchetti family was probably designed by architect Marco Treves also author of the synagogue in Florence and the resettlement of the small building at the entrance. It is a kiosk covered with a barrel vault. The walls are open and marked by pillars, with a cornice running outside and an arched pediment, all finely decorated.  Other tombs  There are many types and sizes of the tombs, from those to sarcophagus to those of cippo, from simple tombstones to broken columns. The most elaborate sarcophagi are raised by leopard paws and supported by other structures, with carved scarves, crowns of garland, etc. There are two burial tombs with columns, recalling some of the 19th-century rhetorical works, such as theatrical scenery. It dates back to 1846 and was carved by Aronne Sanguinetti for Chiara Rafael: it has Doric columns, fronts and acrobats. Epitaphs are generally written in Hebrew and in Italian.  Notes  * G.

The RRA is charged with enforcing, assessing, collecting, and accounting for the various taxes imposed in Rwanda. Location The headquarters of RRA are located at Rwanda Revenue Authority House, located in the neighborhood of Kimiruhura, in the capital city of Kigali. RRA maintains other offices in the country. The coordinates of the headquarters of the organization are:01¬∞57'10.0\\"S, 30¬∞05'05.0\\"E (Latitude:-1.952778; Longitude:30.084722). Overview The law that created the Rwanda Revenue Authority was passed by the Rwandan Parliament in 1997, but the agency became operational in 1998. RRA is supervised by the Rwanda Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning. RRA started in 1998, with 200 employees who needed training and equipping with skills and technology to perform their duties. An organisational structure had to be established and streamlined into departments and a coherent chain of command. As of May 2017 the tax body was expected to collect at least RWF:1 trillion (approx. US$1,215,000,000), for the first time in the financial year ending in June 2017. At that time, the agency maintained 168,346 taxpayers. Non compliance by large corporate clients, and the sourcing and retention of qualified experienced staff, remain challenges for the tax agency. Administration The chief executive officer of the organization is the Commissioner General, currently Pascal Bizimana Ruganintwali, appointed by the President of Rwanda, with the consent of the Senate, for a term of five years, renewable once. The Commissioner General is assisted by a Deputy Commissioner General. The agency has two service departments, each headed by a commissioner: (1) the Customs Services Department and (2) the Domestic Taxes Department.

He is best known as a friend of Madame de Sta√´l, Benjamin Constant, Abel-Fran√ßois Villemain and Prosper de Barante. Their letters to him have been preserved, and are a valuable record of the intellectual life of the First French Empire. Early years Claude Hochet was born in Paris on 24 November 1772 in the rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honor√©, parish of Sainte-Marie- Madeleine. His parents were Claude Thomas Hochet (1735‚Äì1807), a Paris spice merchant, and Marie Elisabeth R√©v√©rard (died 1807). He had four sisters. French Revolution (1789‚Äì99) During the French Revolution Hochet joined the army during the mass conscription decreed by the National Convention. On 4 November 1793 he left Paris with his battalion to fight the Chouans at Coutances. When the troops reached Carentan they mutinied and made for Cherbourg. Hochet was one of four officers who were arrested. They were imprisoned in turn in Avranches, Dol, Rennes and then Arras, where they spent several months. They were released after the Thermidorian Reaction of 27 July 1794. For a short time Hochet was Secretary of the Council of Commerce, which was under the Committee of Public Safety. He then began a career as a journalist, and was one of the first contributors to Jean-Baptiste-Antoine Suard's Le Publiciste, where he was a drama critic. He translated Niccol√≤ Machiavelli's The Art of War, edited the letters of √âmilie du Ch√¢telet, and wrote a brochure about the Council of State. Napoleonic era (1799‚Äì1814) After his release from prison and return to Paris in 1794 Hochet wrote Souvenirs de ma d√©tention en 1793 (Memories of my detention in 1793). He said at the end of his life that he was glad to have written this work, not because of any literary merit, but because his very successful readings of the work were his first entry into the world, when he collected many illustrious friendships that were faithful to him during his long career. He seems to have been referring to the salons of Madame Am√©lie Suard at the end of 1799. He met Benjamin Constant and Madame de Sta√´l at Madame Suard's salon in Paris, and would remain a friend and correspondent of Madame de Sta√´l for the rest of her life. They each wrote about sixty letters to the other between 1800 and 1815. Hochet also became a friend of Julie Talma, Madame R√©camier and Prosper de Barante. Gabrielle Boigues (1788‚Äì1855) Hochet left Le Publiciste around 1805 to become chief clerk of the Interior section of the Council of State. He then became a secretary in the Department of the Interior. He was appointed a member of the Committee of the Legal Claims Department in 1806. On 5 September 1807, when he was secretary of the Contentious Affairs Committee, he married Gabrielle Boigues (1788‚Äì1855). She was the daughter of Pierre Boigues, a rich Parisian merchant, and Catherine Brousse. She brought a rich dowry of land, cash, jewels and two houses in Paris, and expected an inheritance from her father. After his marriage Hochet lived very peacefully with his wife and children. Their first child was Claire, born on 1 July 1808. She died on 15 September 1821. Their eldest son Prosper Hochet was born in Paris on 26 April 1810 and their second son Jules Hochet was born on 17 mars 1813. On 12 January 1814 Claude Hochet was elected Captain of the National Guard. He rallied to the Bourbons, and by royal order of 6 July 1814 was appointed secretary-clerk of the Committee of Litigation, then secretary of the Council of State. Later career (1814‚Äì57) After the Bourbon Restoration Claude Hochet was made Secretary of the Council of State on 24 August 1815. On 14 May 1817 he acquired a estate in Clamart for 30,000 francs. It had two main lodges, stables, an aviary, meadows, vineyards, walks and ponds. In 1822, he was appointed as an Honorary State Counselor. Two more daughters were born, Louise (1818‚Äì86) and Gabrielle Claire (1823‚Äì93). His brother-in-law, Jean Louis Boigues (1784‚Äì1838) was the head of the ironworks at Fourchambault, Ni√®vre, which became a societ√© en commandite, a form of limited partnership, after his death. His son Jules Hochet became manager of the iron foundry of the Soci√©t√© Boigues & Cie. Claude Hochet was made Master of Requests and honorary Councilor of State in 1822. He resigned from his offices in 1839 to make way for his son Prosper. Prosper Hochet replaced his father as Secretary General of the Council of State on 12 March 1839. Claude Hochet died on 3 October 1857 at the Ch√¢teau de la Thibaudi√®re, Montreuil-Juign√©, home of his daughter Mme Alfred de Mieulle. In his will he left his correspondence and manuscripts to his two surviving daughters. He said that the greater part of the letters were of Madame de Stael, Charles de Damas, MM. de Barante and Benjamin Constant. He was buried in the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

Bettering Communities  Under Brooker's leadership at Montgomery Ward the Ward's store managers became more involved in their community's affairs. Brooker realized he had to apply the methods he used in business leadership to getting people who represented Montgomery Ward to be more involved in their own communities. Brooker once said, \\"It's sound economic sense to preserve an environment in which we all do our fair share for our community. It's the greatest product in the world to sell.\\" When Montgomery Ward's headquarters needed new space, the company needed to decide if it would move to a safer location, as Sears had already announced, or to stay put. Brooker decided the company would remain and work with its neighborhood to better the environment. Brooker making the commitment to invest in its neighborhood helped clear up one of the more explosive areas in Chicago.

Biography Henriques was born in Stoke Newington to Orthodox Jewish parents. Her father, James Henry Loewe, was a bankers' agent from Brighton while her mother, Emma n√©e Immerwahr, had emigrated to London from Beuthen in Upper Silesia. At the age of 16, Rose was sent to stay with relations in Breslau, now Wroc≈Çaw, where she trained as a pianist and learned to speak German. After her marriage to Basil Henriques in 1917 she decided to concentrate on social work. The couple worked on a number of joint enterprises together. From 1914 until 1948, they were the joint wardens of the St George's Jewish Settlement in Stepney, later known as the Bernhard Baron St George's Jewish Settlement. The settlement housed a number of social and educational clubs. During World War I, Rose Henriques worked as a nurse at Liverpool Street station and in World War II, she served as an air- raid warden and also organized an emergency feeding scheme for people whose homes had been destroyed in the Blitz. During the Blitz, she completed a large number of drawings and paintings of events in the East End, many of which are now held by the Museum of London. At the start of World War II, Henriques applied to work for the War Artists' Advisory Committee, but it was only later in the conflict that the Committee purchased one of her watercolours, Shelter Entrance from 1941. When the war ended, Henriques went to Germany where she worked alongside a number of Jewish welfare groups at the former Bergen-Belsen concentration camp and then at the nearby displaced persons camp. On returning to England, Henriques was the chair of the British Ose Society for promoting mental and physical health and foundered Workrooms for the Elderly in east London. In the East End she promoted local musicians and artists and continued to paint London street scenes, largely concentrating on events in Aldgate, Whitechapel and Spitalfields and the local Jewish community. In 1947 the Whitechapel Art Gallery hosted an exhibition of her work, Stepney in War & Peace, while a further hundred of her works were shown at the same venue as Vanishing Stepney in 1961. In 1955 Basil Henriques was knighted and his wife became known as Lady Henriques. The local council renamed the street where the St George's Jewish Settlement was located as Henriques Street in honour of the couple. Henriques published her autobiography, Fifty Years in Stepney in 1966. In 1964 Rose Henriques received the Henrietta Szold Award for services to the Jewish community and in 1971 was awarded the CBE for her social work in the East End. A large retrospective of her paintings was held in 2013 in Tower Hamlets. In May 2019, the British Government honoured Henriques with the British Hero of the Holocaust award.

Boyle, G. Claris Adams, Herbert R. Hyman, William Heilman and Roger W. Wallace. The principal qualification for membership is participation in an Intercollegiate oratorical or debating contest. Members are elected by the several State Councils in their respective States, and Alumni of accredited institutions may also be elected. The scheme of organization was a peculiar one. Charters were not granted to institutions of learning as such, but to eligible persons in each State upon the petition of students from a representative institution or institutions in such State and expansion within that State was entrusted to the charter members of the State Chapter. The purpose of this plan was to enable the election of desirable men from colleges not large enough or perhaps not strong enough to warrant the installation of or to maintain a separate chapter. It was found to be impracticable and at a convention held in 1914 the society was reorganized and chapters given an independent existence in the usual way. By 1958 it had 90 national chapters, and both men and women were admitted. Colors were light and dark purple. Combined The Delta Sigma Rho and Tau Kappa Alpha merged on August 18, 1963.

General Jacques Fran√ßois Dugommier died during the battle, but he defeated the allied armies. The famous surgeon Larrey also distinguished himself during this battle practicing in one day not less than 200 amputations. This decisive French victory led to the capture of Figueres, then to the victorious Siege of Roses and to the escape of the Spanish troops by sea, and finally to the signature of the Peace of Basel between France and Prussia (April 5, 1795) and between France and Spain (July 22, 1795 - 4 Thermidor Year III), by which the two countries signed peace with the victorious revolutionary France, thus abandoning the First Coalition.

In September 1795, this Army of Italy had received four divisions (16,000 men) of reinforcements from the victorious Army of the Eastern Pyrenees. With these reinforcements, this small army, with a strength of 50,000 men, was composed in large majority of battalions of volunteers coming from Southern France.

Captain Cal√®s and his 4th Regiment fought at this famous battle of the campaign of Italy on 15‚Äì17 November 1796. Following the plan of a lightning offensive meditated by General Bonaparte for a long time, the 4th line infantry regiment of Cal√®s (General Augereau's Division) fought at the battles of the bridge of Lodi (10 May 1796), Castiglione (5 August), Bassano (8 September), the bridge of Arcole (15-17 November) and Rivoli (13-14 January 1797).

Although this battle, won by the French commanded by Generals Bonaparte, Massena and Augereau against three Austrian armies of Habsburg Austria, was not decisive, it is nevertheless considered by historians to be the most important battle regarding the victorious fate of the Italian campaign during the war of the First Coalition. = In the Armies of the West, of Batavia, and of the Rhine (1800) = The 4th regiment returned to France at the beginning of the year 1798, but did not, however, follow General Bonaparte in his campaign of Egypt and Syria conducted between 1798 and 1801.

Six days later, on 19 Floreal Year VIII (9 May 1800), at the Battle of Biberach, Cal√®s commanded the battalion of the reunited Grenadiers: he repulsed the enemy, and seized two pieces of cannon. The French corps commanded by General Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr won the battle against a part of the Habsburg Austrian Army commanded by General Paul Kray. On 15 July 1800, Moreau signed with Kray the armistice of Parsdorf. Recalled to France, the 4th demi-brigade crossed the Rhine at Kehl and arrived in Nancy in August 1801.

There, captain Cal√®s was appointed member of the Legion of Honor (L√©gionnaire, renamed Chevalier (Knight) a few years later) on 25 Prairial Year XII (14 June 1804). Napoleon Ier, newly proclaimed Emperor of the French (18 May 1804), decorated Cal√®s in the camp of Boulogne the 16 August 1804, at the occasion of the very first military l√©gion d'honneur decoration ceremony in French history.The very first appointments in french history were published in September 1803 Captain Cal√®s was also promoted battalion Commander in the 4th Infantry regiment of line of the Grande Arm√©e on 3 Germinal Year XIII (24 March 1805).Battalion Commander (on the left: left epaulette with thick fringes, right epaulette without fringes) & Colonel (on the right: two epaulettes with thick fringes) of the Grande Arm√©e - Line Infantry - 1812 (by Carle Vernet, La Grande Arm√©e de 1812) He served in the famed IV Corps commended by Marchal Soult, under the orders of Colonel Joseph Bonapartein ¬´ Correspondance de Napol√©on ¬ª (Correspondance of Napol√©on); t.9, letter 7693 (Napoleon's elder brother, and later King of Naples and Sicily and of Spain) first, and soon later, under the orders of Colonel Louis-L√©ger Boyeldieu (fr). At the head of the 3rd battalion of reserve Cal√®s did not take part, however, to the first battles of the campaign of Austria (1805) (Battles of Ulm and Austerlitz) and stationed in the camps of Nancy (June 1805), Schiltigheim (March 1806) and Strasbourg (January, May, July 1806). = Campaigns of Prussia (1806) and of Poland (1807) = Batatalion Commander Cal√®s was finally sent to combat in October 1806 and fought during the campaigns of Prussia (1806) and Poland (1807). He did not however participate neither to the famous battle of Jena, nor to that of Auerstedt (both conducted in parallel on 14 October 1806, and where the Prussian army was literally swept by the French troops), because the Division Leval, which included his 4th regiment, could not arrive on time at Jena. He distinguished himself however at the fight of Bergfried (3 February 1807), a prelude to the battle of Eylau:in ¬´ Rapport du Mar√©chal Soult, commandant le 4e Corps, sur la campagne de 1807 ¬ª (Report of Marshal Soult, commanding the 4th Corps, on the campaign of 1807).

The arrival of his regiment (within Division Leval) proved decisive and forced the Russians to withdraw from the first day of the battle.¬´ On the 4th of February, at daybreak, the division met before a small village, and the two companies of voltigeurs were sent into a wood to the right of the position, and the regiment marched in battle, arrived at the enemy, the battalion Commander Cal√®s, who commanded it in the absence of the wounded Colonel, was ordered to search the wood with the 1st battalion and take his direction to the left, The resistance he made in the wood, and even more the difficulty of the roads, delayed the march of the battalion, and gave time to the enemy to retire. Despite this, many Russian chasseurs were killed or taken prisoner, and many baggage was abandoned. ¬ª (Itin√©raire et notes historiques du 4e de ligne. Cf. 56e Bulletin de la Grande Arm√©e)Colonel of a Line Infantry Regiment in the Grande Arm√©e (by Richard Kn√∂tel) Battalion Commander Cal√®s was consequently promoted Colonel on 14 February 1807, the day following Colonel Boyeldieu's return, and took over command of the 96th Infantry Regiment (the historic R√©giment de Nassau, in which celebrated French poet Guillaume Apollinaire will fight a century later, in 1915 during WWI, as a sous-lieutenant). Cal√®s then served in the famed I Corps commended by Marchal Victor, and was commanding three battalions and about 4,000 soldiers in this 96th Infantry Regiment. Colonel Cal√®s notably commanded the 96th Regiment at the famous battle of Friedland on 14 June 1807, where the French army commanded by Napoleon obtained a spectacular victory over the Russian army led by Count Levin August von Bennigsen. This decisive victory marked, by the signature of the treaties of Tilsit (7 and 9 July 1807) by Emperor Napoleon I and Tzar Alexander I, the end of the war of the Fourth Coalition and the beginning of a short period of peace in Europe. Colonel Cal√®s was made Officer of the Legion of Honor (Officier de la L√©gion d'Honneur) on the following 11 July (1807). = Campaign of Spain (1808) = In September 1808, Colonel Cal√®s and his regiment were reassigned to the Army of Spain, still within the I Corps commanded by Marchal Victor, to take part to the Spanish War. At the Battle of the Sommosierra Pass on 30 November, the 96th Infantry Regiment was one of the most severely tested corpses, with about ten soldiers killed, forty wounded, and three wounded officers, including Colonel Cal√®s, who got shot at his right leg.¬´ Historique du 96e r√©giment d'infanterie ¬ª (History of the 96th Infantry Regiment), Capitaine Jean-Baptiste Bouvier, 427 pages, editions A.

Cal√®s got severely shot a second time at his leg during a deadly assault on 28 July 1809 at the Battle of Talavera (some 120 kilometers southwest of Madrid), one of the most bloody battles of the Spanish War, which costed about 7,000 lives in total to each camp. He was created Baron of the Empire by the Emperor Napoleon I, on 15 August 1809. A very small number of Colonels was appointed to this nobility rank, which was generally reserved for Generals, Mayors of large cities, and Bishops. Between 1808 and 1814, 1,090 titles of baron were created. Admitted to retirement on 15 May 1810, he left the Army on the following 1 July, and retired to Cessales (Haute-Garonne), from where he witnessed the abdication of the Emperor Napoleon I, his forced exile on the island of Elba, and the return of King Louis XVIII (1st Restoration) in April 1814.

Since then, the entire coastal plain of the east coast has experienced a constant rise in sea level and rose dramatically between 2011 and 2015.https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sea-level-rise-is-speeding-up- in-parts-of-the-southeastern-u-s/http://news.ufl.edu/articles/2017/08/east- coasts-rapidly-rising-seas-explained.php In 1998, Corncrake Inlet was officially shoaled and closed due to the damages of Hurricane Bonnie.http://www.allaboutwilmington.com/pages/pleasure_island Before Corncrake Inlet was closed, it was noted as a shad fishing location.https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CZIC-sh167-s5-a44-1990/html/CZIC- sh167-s5-a44-1990.htm References Inlets of North Carolina ","title":"Corncake Inlet, North Carolina"},{"id":"55159731","text":"Renan Gorne Silva (born 22 February 1996) is a Brazilian footballer who plays as a forward for Confian√ßa.

The name \\"Aegis\\" originally derived from Greek mythology and is a reference to Zeus' shield, meant to \\"evoke protection for the interests of Harford residents\\" as well as the paper's Southern sympathies.  Politics  Cox's editorial tone was overwhelmingly negative towards the Union, and he became known as an \\"editor of the old school, violent in his sympathies and in his editorials\\" with a signature \\"old fashioned Jacksonian style.\\" The Aegis and the other local paper, the National American, became voices for the opposing sides of the national conflict; The Aegis was even referred to by a Baltimore newspaper as \\"the Traitor Aegis\\". However, Cox eventually realized that there was not enough support for the Confederate cause in Harford County to continue publishing, and in 1862, he resigned and sold the paper to a prominent local lawyer named A.W. Bateman, who changed the name of the paper to The Southern Aegis, and Harford County Intelligencer. Bateman changed the tone of the paper to a conservative Unionist stance, which continued under his successor, Frederick W. Baker. Baker purchased the newspaper in 1864 and slightly changed its name to The Aegis & Intelligencer. The Aegis & Intelligencer was sold to John D. Worthington, Sr. in 1904, but kept its name until 1923, when it was changed to The Aegis (newspaper).\\"The Southern Aegis,\\" Chronicling America The Aegis went through several name changes over the years: it became The Aegis and Harford Gazette in 1951, then The Aegis the Harford Gazette and the Democratic Ledger in 1964, and finally back to The Aegis in 1969, which it remains to this day. The paper remained in the hands of the Worthington family until 1986, when it was acquired by the Times Mirror Company, then-owners of The Baltimore Sun.

Harvard 23.6 (1893): 199‚Äì244 Description The length of the shell attains 15 mm, its diameter 6 mm. (Original description) The shell is rather large for the genus, regularly fusiform, thin and translucent. It is bluish white, with a roughened surface of waxy lustre, and a shining tip of a delicate yellow tint. The spire measures about half the length of the shell. It consists of seven decidedly shouldered whorls, besides the protoconch. The aperture is long and narrow. The posterior sinus is large and nearly round, commencing at the suture and reaching to the shoulder, cutting into the top of the varlx formed by the thickening of the last transverse rib. It thus shows a thickened border with the upper edge rounded but not raised above the surface of the shell, extending farther back than the inner edge and curving strongly with the lines of growth, nearly meeting in front. From this the thin outer lip reaches far forward over the aperture, leaving a very narrow opening. Near the anterior end it is pinched in slightly, then bends abruptly backward as though cut off obliquely, revealing the entire width of the siphonal canal, and, curving a little upward, forms a slight notch before joining the columella. The edge of the lip is rounded and crimped by the termination of the revolving threads. The columella has a slight sigmoid curvature and an inconspicuous layer of enamel. The suture is distinct, undulating, slightly channelled. The concave subsutural band occupies about a third of the width of the upper whorls, and is crossed by fine indistinct lines of growth. Conspicuous, rather broad, angular, oblique ribs cross the whorls, scarcely evident on the subsutural band, but rise somewhat abruptly on its lower edge, forming a sharp shoulder at the periphery. There are eleven of these ribs on the body whorl, reaching to the base of the siphonal canal. These, with their equally broad, concave interspaces, are ornamented with about twenty-five conspicuously raised, uniform, rounded threads, pretty regularly separated, but a little crowded on the anterior end of the siphonal canal. On the penultimate whorl there are six of them, the first just above the shoulder and the last just above the suture. The lines of growth are very indistinct. The protoconch is small, shining, consisting of three and a half regularly coiled whorls, the lower one ornamented with a peripheral keel. The entire surface of the shell is covered with minute granules, closely crowded except on the protoconch, where they are somewhat scattered and discernible only under a high magnifying power.

His style was a commanding one, and his game was marked by all-round excellence. Possessed of a powerful and accurate overhand service, a severe ground-stroke, formidable volleying and smashing powers, and great activity, he ought to have reached the very top of the tree. But from one cause or another he was never able to give that serious and unremitting attention to the game which successful tournament play exacts from its votaries. Consequently his performances, good though many of them were, never quite equalled the promise held out. He was very successful in Doubles with Ernest Renshaw.

His brother Stanis≈Çaw Mas≈Çowski was a Polish painter who lived from 1853‚Äì1926. His grandfather, Wincenty Danilewicz (Ostoja coat of arms, born in 1787 in Mi≈Ñsk Lit, a former Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth territory), was enlisted as a light-cavalryman for active duty in the Napoleonic campaign, for which he was awarded the French Order of Legion of Honour.

According to records, in 1864 he was arrested and dispatched on unknown charges, then sentenced approximately six months at Kielce prison. In 1865, the Mas≈Çowski family established residence in Kalisz. Education After graduating from a local high school in Kalisz, Mas≈Çowski began a two-year study of pharmacy in Warsaw, where his parents had relocated in 1871. It is unknown what became of his academic efforts in Warsaw. He continued his studies at Heidelberg University. There, he frequently attended the lectures of Professor Robert Bunsen.Kazimierz Sarnecki: Polish Biographical Dictionary, op.cit. Mas≈Çowski's studies were interrupted in 1877 by the outbreak of the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878). A subject to the Russian Empire, Mas≈Çowski was drafted into the Imperial Russian Army and put into the sanitary service. Fortunately, he was able to continue his education after the war ended. Once he left the army, he picked up his studies at Mulhouse, Alsace. During his time there, he learnt from the great Professor E. Noelting. Mas≈Çowski graduated in 1881 with a degree in dye (pigment) chemistry, as a specialization.Kazimierz Sarnecki: Polish Biographical Dictionary, op.cit. Career Mas≈Çowski's career began when he took a job as a laborer in a dye Joint-Stock Company \\"Zawiercie\\" (Silesia). During the two initial months of internship, he received high praise from superiors for his achievements. As a result, he quickly became a collaborator of E. Lauter, who was an outstanding specialist in the field of dyeing techniques. Within three months, he was hired as manager of calico printing. Three years later, he was promoted to company manager, with 6000 employees under his supervision. Mas≈Çowski held this position until 1891 after which he moved to Germany. There, five years later, he published in Farber Zeitung an article on alkaline methods of removing Turkish red dye. In 1904, Mas≈Çowski began working at a textile plant in Konice on Moravia (the territory of Austro-Hungary, then Czechoslovakia). He remained there as a managing director until his death on June 20, 1928, in Konice, leaving his children with his wife Felice.M.

It is the sixth and final installment of the John Wayne Cleaver series, following Over Your Dead Body (2016). The novel concludes the story of sociopathic teenage protagonist John Cleaver and his hunt of an ancient network of demons who call themselves \\"the Withered.\\" After bringing his best friend Brooke back to her home and family, John travels to Arizona to find Rain, the Queen of the Withered. In what appears to be a simple, small town, John has to face multiple demons, all while trying to hide from the FBI. Critical reception of Nothing Left to Lose was mostly positive, and the book was nominated for both an AML Award and a Dragon Award. It has been published in English, Spanish, and German. The audiobook version is narrated by Kirby Heyborne.  Development  Like the earlier books in the series, Nothing Left to Lose required research on Wells's part of embalming and other aspects of a mortuary. He also drew upon his experiences traveling to Germany to write about John's travels in the second trilogy of the series. Wells wanted to write the novel in such a way that new readers not familiar with John or his past would be able to understand the events that occur in this sixth book. He asserted in an episode of the podcast Writing Excuses that Nothing Left to Lose would be the last book in the John Cleaver series. He has, however, mentioned the possibility of releasing short stories \\"about some of [John's] travels the books only hint at.\\"  Plot summary  John Wayne Cleaver is again flying solo on his vendetta against the supernatural killers called \\"the Withered.\\" He follows a lead to the town of Lewisville, Arizona in search of a demon named \\"Rain.\\" His first stop is the funeral of a woman he suspects might be a victim of a Withered. There, he is approached by an odd, homeless-looking woman who tells him to \\"Run from Rain.\\" He lands a job as the local mortuary's make-up artist and makes friends with his boss, Margo, and fellow employee, Jasmyn. When townspeople begin to die under strange circumstances, John's gig allows him to examine the bodies of the victims: a woman who drowned nowhere near water, and a boy who was burned alive nowhere near fire. Then, while walking by the local canal, John is almost drowned by a man who claims \\" the Dark Lady\\" was sent to kill him. He is rescued by a few men, one of which is a demon named Assu, who has the power to burn things. He craves cold, so John takes him back to the mortuary‚Äôs freezer. There, a fire ignites and Assu is disintegrated into demonic black sludge. John tries to clean it all up, worried that if it is discovered, the FBI will track him down. With this in mind, he takes extra precautions, including arming the mortuary doors with motion detectors and finding a new place to stay. The mortuary receives the body of the burned boy, and John finds two confounding hand prints on his arms that were left unscathed. Further contributing to his confusion, another drowned body is found at a junkyard out in the desert, with strange splash marks nearby. Then, the Agent Mills of the FBI shows up in Lewisville. Immediately he inspects the mortuary and finds some of the black sludge left behind from the fire. Knowing that Mills will trace this evidence back to him, John runs out of town along the highway; but before he can escape, the same homeless-looking woman from the funeral attacks him. She flees when a car shows up, and John climbs inside before he realizes the driver is Mills. Exhausted from being attacked, John gives in and resigns himself to being in the custody of the FBI. Once they arrive at Mills‚Äô motel, they find the dead body of a fellow agent displayed in the room. Then, Mills ‚Äì whose actual name is Sam Harris ‚Äì is taken over by the Dark Lady. He attacks the only other remaining FBI agent in Lewisville, but John manages to knock him out with a shower rod before any more damage can be done. Then, he immediately goes to tell his friends at the mortuary of the impending danger, but upon arrival learns that Margo is the Dark Lady. Thousands of years ago, she gave up her unborn child to become a \\"goddess,\\" and ever since, she has used her powers to take care of young wayward souls, trying to make up for her loss. The Dark Lady tells John that there are only three Withered left, and that she is trying to create more to keep their legacy intact. John thinks about something Jasmyn once said ‚Äì that everyone is worth saving ‚Äì and tries to help the Withered by telling them the rules he put in place for himself to control his dangerous impulses. Realizing just how much he has changed himself, he exhorts them to follow a similar path and curb their lust for blood. The FBI come, and a terrible array of violence breaks out. The homeless woman shows up and uses her powers to drown multiple agents, as well as another Withered that attacks John. Margo reveals that she turned this woman, Dana, into a demon sixty years ago as part of her plan to create more monsters. Because of her misery and desire to end the cycle of killing, Dana then drowns herself. Once Margo is the only Withered left, John convinces Agent Harris to let him stay with her to keep her in check; this way, a government execution will not be in her future. Five months later, John is remains in Lewisville with Margo, helping her contain her darker side as well as continuing to improve himself. One day, Harris shows up with Margaret and Lauren, John‚Äôs aunt and sister, respectively. John‚Äôs story ends with him befriending the demon queen and a tearful, joyful reunion with the only family he has left.  Reception  Rick Feldschau reviewed the book for Deseret News, writing that the conclusion \\"felt a bit far-fetched and saccharine\\" but concluded that \\"Dan Wells' latest comes in as one of the greats in the Cleaver series, paralleled only by book five's emotional depth and book one's intro to readers' favorite sociopath.\\" Alternative Magazine Online reviewer Marty Mulrooney wrote that \\"Nothing Left to Lose takes all the atypical ingredients that have made the series so devilishly enjoyable and mixes them together in exciting new ways,\\" and stated that while the ending \\"stretches believability,\\" but that it was \\"worth it\\". Elitist Book Reviews also rated Nothing Left as a worthy conclusion for the series, recommending the novel's \\"twisty villains, twistier plots, and ... main character with (a knife and) all the heart in the world\\" to readers. At the Barnes and Nobel Science Fiction and Fantasy blog, Adam Rowe wrote that he the story was \\"streamlined\\" and \\"gripping,\\" \\"filled with the horrifying, murderous fun his fans rely on.\\"  Awards and nominations  * 2017 AML Award nominee for Best Novel * 2017 Dragon Award nominee for Best Horror Novel  References   External links  * Author's website * Dan Wells papers at L.

Conceived of as a grand monument, it suffered from construction issues and was eventually abandoned as the channel it marked was supplanted by other routes. One of Latrobe's drawings for the proposed tower History Funds for a light to mark the entrance to the Mississippi from the delta were appropriated in 1803 in the amount of $25,000, and plans were drawn up by Benjamin Latrobe; he designed an elaborate structure consisting of a tall central tower surrounded by a round house and colonnade, but the War of 1812 prevented work from going forward. After the war, Henry S. B. Latrobe revised his father's plans, but even at the then princely sum of $55,000 there was no taker for the work. Finally Winslow Lewis was persuaded to take on the work, and besides demanding $79,000 for the work, he stipulated that an inspector supervise the work to verify that the design was being followed. Construction began in 1818, but early the following year the structure collapsed. Lewis drew up a third, much simpler design for a double-walled conical brick tower, for which he charged $10,000; construction resumed, using materials from the collapsed tower, and the light was first lit in 1823. It was the first of a number towers erected by Lewis, and at the time the tallest lighthouse on the gulf coast. By the late 1850s the channel marked by the light was silting up, and a new light was erected to the north on Pass A L'Outre. The keeper of the Frank's Island Light moved to the new post, and the tower was abandoned. It stood for another 144 years before collapsing in 2002.

He was one of the founding members of the Acad√©mie Charles-Cros.  Biography  Having been pushed by his father to become a violinist, Antoine Gol√©a entered the Conservatory of Bucharest at the age of nine, and studied violin under the guidance of Cecilia Nitzulescu, a brilliant and despotic \\"failed violinist\\", who initially believed in his talent. But, after nine years of study, they both have to face the facts: he was not made to be a virtuoso violinist, despite his undeniable gifts, in particular that of the \\"absolute pitch\\", and despite the first violin prize which crowned his long years of study. He was then eighteen years old. After three years at the French high school in Bucharest, his parents decided to send him to France to complete his secondary education. He arrived in Montpellier towards the end of the summer of 1928 and, having obtained his bachelor's degree in philosophy and a certificate of higher studies in German, he moved to Paris in October 1929, where he settled for the rest of his life.

He also wrote a Histoire du balletHistoire du ballet (1967). Towards the end of his life, however, Gol√©a was led to somewhat soften his positions. In the last published work of his lifetime (La Musique de la nuit des temps aux aurores nouvelles.La Musique de la nuit des temps aux aurores nouvelles on WorldCat), he must recognize that \\"an even more serious phenomenon has occurred: serial music died of his beautiful death...\\" However, Gol√©a has always been an ardent defender of the music of Debussy, Messiaen, Schoenberg and Boulez, whom he considered to be the true creators of contemporary music, whereas, when asked what a Richard Strauss meant in the evolution of contemporary music, his answer was astounding: \\"Nothing, very exactly!

Sigma bonds result from an overlap of sp2 hybrid orbitals, whereas pi bonds emerge from tunneling between the protruding pz orbitals. For clarity, only one pz orbital is shown with its three nearest neighbors. Graphene is a semimetal whose conduction and valence bands meet at the Dirac points, which are six locations in momentum space, the vertices of its hexagonal Brillouin zone, divided into two non-equivalent sets of three points. The two sets are labeled K and K'. The sets give graphene a valley degeneracy of . By contrast, for traditional semiconductors the primary point of interest is generally Œì, where momentum is zero. Four electronic properties separate it from other condensed matter systems. Electronic spectrum Electrons propagating through graphene's honeycomb lattice effectively lose their mass, producing quasi-particles that are described by a 2D analogue of the Dirac equation rather than the Schr√∂dinger equation for spin- particles. Dispersion relation  Electronic band structure of graphene. Valence and conduction bands meet at the six vertices of the hexagonal Brillouin zone and form linearly dispersing Dirac cones. When atoms are placed onto the graphene hexagonal lattice, the overlap between the pz(œÄ) orbitals and the s or the px and py orbitals is zero by symmetry. The pz electrons forming the œÄ bands in graphene can be treated independently. Within this œÄ-band approximation, using a conventional tight-binding model, the dispersion relation (restricted to first-nearest-neighbor interactions only) that produces energy of the electrons with wave vector \\\\mathbf{k}=[k_x,k_y] is :E(\\\\mathbf{k})=\\\\pm\\\\,\\\\gamma_0\\\\sqrt{1+4\\\\cos^2{\\\\tfrac{1}{2}a k_x}+4\\\\cos{\\\\tfrac{1}{2}a k_x} \\\\cdot \\\\cos{\\\\tfrac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2}a k_y}} with the nearest-neighbor (œÄ orbitals) hopping energy Œ≥0 ‚âà and the lattice constant . The conduction and valence bands, respectively, correspond to the different signs. With one pz electron per atom in this model the valence band is fully occupied, while the conduction band is vacant. The two bands touch at the zone corners (the K point in the Brillouin zone), where there is a zero density of states but no band gap. The graphene sheet thus displays a semimetallic (or zero-gap semiconductor) character. Two of the six Dirac points are independent, while the rest are equivalent by symmetry. In the vicinity of the K-points the energy depends linearly on the wave vector, similar to a relativistic particle. Since an elementary cell of the lattice has a basis of two atoms, the wave function has an effective 2-spinor structure. As a consequence, at low energies, even neglecting the true spin, the electrons can be described by an equation that is formally equivalent to the massless Dirac equation. Hence, the electrons and holes are called Dirac fermions. This pseudo-relativistic description is restricted to the chiral limit, i.e., to vanishing rest mass M0, which leads to additional features: : v_F\\\\, \\\\vec \\\\sigma \\\\cdot abla \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r})\\\\,=\\\\,E\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}). Here vF ~ (.003 c) is the Fermi velocity in graphene, which replaces the velocity of light in the Dirac theory; \\\\vec{\\\\sigma} is the vector of the Pauli matrices; \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}) is the two-component wave function of the electrons and E is their energy. The equation describing the electrons' linear dispersion relation is :E(k)=\\\\hbar v_F k where the wavevector k=\\\\sqrt{k_x^2+k_y^2} is measured from the Dirac points (the zero of energy is chosen here to coincide with the Dirac points). The equation uses a pseudospin matrix formula that describes two sublattices of the honeycomb lattice.  'Massive' electrons  Graphene's unit cell has two identical carbon atoms and two zero-energy states: one in which the electron resides on atom A, the other in which the electron resides on atom B. However, if the two atoms in the unit cell are not identical, the situation changes. Hunt et al. showed that placing hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) in contact with graphene can alter the potential felt at atom A versus atom B enough that the electrons develop a mass and accompanying band gap of about 30 meV [0.03 Electron Volt (eV)]. The mass can be positive or negative. An arrangement that slightly raises the energy of an electron on atom A relative to atom B gives it a positive mass, while an arrangement that raises the energy of atom B produces a negative electron mass. The two versions behave alike and are indistinguishable via optical spectroscopy. An electron traveling from a positive-mass region to a negative-mass region must cross an intermediate region where its mass once again becomes zero. This region is gapless and therefore metallic. Metallic modes bounding semiconducting regions of opposite-sign mass is a hallmark of a topological phase and display much the same physics as topological insulators. If the mass in graphene can be controlled, electrons can be confined to massless regions by surrounding them with massive regions, allowing the patterning of quantum dots, wires and other mesoscopic structures. It also produces one-dimensional conductors along the boundary. These wires would be protected against backscattering and could carry currents without dissipation. Single-atom wave propagation Electron waves in graphene propagate within a single-atom layer, making them sensitive to the proximity of other materials such as high-Œ∫ dielectrics, superconductors and ferromagnetics. Electron transport Graphene displays remarkable electron mobility at room temperature, with reported values in excess of . Hole and electron mobilities were expected to be nearly identical. The mobility is nearly independent of temperature between and , which implies that the dominant scattering mechanism is defect scattering. Scattering by graphene's acoustic phonons intrinsically limits room temperature mobility to at a carrier density of , times greater than copper. The corresponding resistivity of graphene sheets would be . This is less than the resistivity of silver, the lowest otherwise known at room temperature.Physicists Show Electrons Can Travel More Than 100 Times Faster in Graphene :: University Communications Newsdesk, University of Maryland . Newsdesk.umd.edu (24 March 2008). Retrieved on 2014-01-12. However, on substrates, scattering of electrons by optical phonons of the substrate is a larger effect than scattering by graphene‚Äôs own phonons. This limits mobility to . Charge transport is affected by adsorption of contaminants such as water and oxygen molecules. This leads to non-repetitive and large hysteresis I-V characteristics. Researchers must carry out electrical measurements in vacuum. Graphene surfaces can be protected by a coating with materials such as SiN, PMMA and h-BN. In January 2015, the first stable graphene device operation in air over several weeks was reported, for graphene whose surface was protected by aluminum oxide. In 2015 lithium-coated graphene was observed to exhibit superconductivity and in 2017 evidence for unconventional superconductivity was demonstrated in single layer graphene placed on the electron-doped (non- chiral) d-wave superconductor Pr2‚àíxCexCuO4 (PCCO). Electrical resistance in 40-nanometer-wide nanoribbons of epitaxial graphene changes in discrete steps. The ribbons' conductance exceeds predictions by a factor of 10. The ribbons can act more like optical waveguides or quantum dots, allowing electrons to flow smoothly along the ribbon edges. In copper, resistance increases in proportion to length as electrons encounter impurities. Transport is dominated by two modes. One is ballistic and temperature independent, while the other is thermally activated. Ballistic electrons resemble those in cylindrical carbon nanotubes. At room temperature, resistance increases abruptly at a particular length‚Äîthe ballistic mode at 16 micrometres and the other at 160 nanometres. Graphene electrons can cover micrometer distances without scattering, even at room temperature. Despite zero carrier density near the Dirac points, graphene exhibits a minimum conductivity on the order of 4e^2/h. The origin of this minimum conductivity is unclear. However, rippling of the graphene sheet or ionized impurities in the substrate may lead to local puddles of carriers that allow conduction. Several theories suggest that the minimum conductivity should be 4e^2/{(\\\\pi}h); however, most measurements are of order 4e^2/h or greater and depend on impurity concentration. Near zero carrier density graphene exhibits positive photoconductivity and negative photoconductivity at high carrier density. This is governed by the interplay between photoinduced changes of both the Drude weight and the carrier scattering rate.Light pulses control how graphene conducts electricity. kurzweilai.net. 4 August 2014 Graphene doped with various gaseous species (both acceptors and donors) can be returned to an undoped state by gentle heating in vacuum. Even for dopant concentrations in excess of 1012 cm‚àí2 carrier mobility exhibits no observable change. Graphene doped with potassium in ultra-high vacuum at low temperature can reduce mobility 20-fold. The mobility reduction is reversible on removing the potassium. Due to graphene's two dimensions, charge fractionalization (where the apparent charge of individual pseudoparticles in low-dimensional systems is less than a single quantum) is thought to occur. It may therefore be a suitable material for constructing quantum computers using anyonic circuits. In 2018, superconductivity was reported in twisted bilayer graphene.  Excitonic properties  First-principle calculations with quasiparticle corrections and many-body effects explore the electronic and optical properties of graphene-based materials. The approach is described as three stages. With GW calculation, the properties of graphene-based materials are accurately investigated, including bulk graphene, nanoribbons, edge and surface functionalized armchair oribbons, hydrogen saturated armchair ribbons, Josephson effect in graphene SNS junctions with single localized defect and armchair ribbon scaling properties.  Magnetic properties  In 2014 researchers magnetized graphene by placing it on an atomically smooth layer of magnetic yttrium iron garnet. The graphene's electronic properties were unaffected. Prior approaches involved doping.T. Hashimoto, S. Kamikawa, Y. Yagi, J. Haruyama, H. Yang, M. Chshiev, \\"Graphene edge spins: spintronics and magnetism in graphene nanomeshes\\", February 2014, Volume 5, Issue 1, pp 25 The dopant's presence negatively affected its electronic properties. Strong magnetic fields In magnetic fields of ‚âà10 tesla, additional plateaus of Hall conductivity at \\\\sigma_{xy}= u e^2/h with u=0,\\\\pm {1},\\\\pm {4} are observed. The observation of a plateau at u=3 and the fractional quantum Hall effect at u=1/3 were reported. These observations with u=0,\\\\pm 1,\\\\pm 3, \\\\pm 4 indicate that the four-fold degeneracy (two valley and two spin degrees of freedom) of the Landau energy levels is partially or completely lifted. One hypothesis is that the magnetic catalysis of symmetry breaking is responsible for lifting the degeneracy. Spin transport Graphene is claimed to be an ideal material for spintronics due to its small spin-orbit interaction and the near absence of nuclear magnetic moments in carbon (as well as a weak hyperfine interaction). Electrical spin current injection and detection has been demonstrated up to room temperature. Spin coherence length above 1 micrometre at room temperature was observed, and control of the spin current polarity with an electrical gate was observed at low temperature. Spintronic and magnetic properties can be present in graphene simultaneously. Low-defect graphene nanomeshes manufactured using a non-lithographic method exhibit large-amplitude ferromagnetism even at room temperature. Additionally a spin pumping effect is found for fields applied in parallel with the planes of few-layer ferromagnetic nanomeshes, while a magnetoresistance hysteresis loop is observed under perpendicular fields.  Dirac fluid  Charged particles in high-purity graphene behave as a strongly interacting, quasi- relativistic plasma. The particles move in a fluid-like manner, traveling along a single path and interacting with high frequency. The behavior was observed in a graphene sheet faced on both sides with a h-BN crystal sheet. Anomalous quantum Hall effect The quantum Hall effect is a quantum mechanical version of the Hall effect, which is the production of transverse (perpendicular to the main current) conductivity in the presence of a magnetic field. The quantization of the Hall effect \\\\sigma_{xy} at integer multiples (the \\"Landau level\\") of the basic quantity e^2/h (where e is the elementary electric charge and h is Planck's constant) It can usually be observed only in very clean silicon or gallium arsenide solids at temperatures around and high magnetic fields. Graphene shows the quantum Hall effect with respect to conductivity quantization: the effect is anomalous in that the sequence of steps is shifted by 1/2 with respect to the standard sequence and with an additional factor of 4. Graphene's Hall conductivity is \\\\sigma_{xy}=\\\\pm {4\\\\cdot\\\\left(N + 1/2 \\\\right)e^2}/h , where N is the Landau level and the double valley and double spin degeneracies give the factor of 4. These anomalies are present at room temperature, i.e. at roughly . This behavior is a direct result of graphene's massless Dirac electrons. In a magnetic field, their spectrum has a Landau level with energy precisely at the Dirac point. This level is a consequence of the Atiyah‚ÄìSinger index theorem and is half- filled in neutral graphene, leading to the \\"+1/2\\" in the Hall conductivity. Bilayer graphene also shows the quantum Hall effect, but with only one of the two anomalies (i.e. \\\\sigma_{xy}=\\\\pm {4\\\\cdot N\\\\cdot e^2}/h ). In the second anomaly, the first plateau at N=0 is absent, indicating that bilayer graphene stays metallic at the neutrality point. Unlike normal metals, graphene's longitudinal resistance shows maxima rather than minima for integral values of the Landau filling factor in measurements of the Shubnikov‚Äìde Haas oscillations, whereby the term integral quantum Hall effect. These oscillations show a phase shift of œÄ, known as Berry‚Äôs phase. Berry‚Äôs phase arises due to the zero effective carrier mass near the Dirac points. The temperature dependence of the oscillations reveals that the carriers have a non-zero cyclotron mass, despite their zero effective mass. Graphene samples prepared on nickel films, and on both the silicon face and carbon face of silicon carbide, show the anomalous effect directly in electrical measurements. Graphitic layers on the carbon face of silicon carbide show a clear Dirac spectrum in angle-resolved photoemission experiments. The effect is observed in cyclotron resonance and tunneling experiments. Casimir effect The Casimir effect is an interaction between disjoint neutral bodies provoked by the fluctuations of the electrodynamical vacuum. Mathematically it can be explained by considering the normal modes of electromagnetic fields, which explicitly depend on the boundary (or matching) conditions on the interacting bodies' surfaces. Since graphene/electromagnetic field interaction is strong for a one-atom-thick material, the Casimir effect is of interest. Van der Waals force The Van der Waals force (or dispersion force) is also unusual, obeying an inverse cubic, asymptotic power law in contrast to the usual inverse quartic. Effect of substrate The electronic properties of graphene are significantly influenced by the supporting substrate. The Si(100)/H surface does not perturb graphene's electronic properties, whereas the interaction between it and the clean Si(100) surface changes its electronic states significantly. This effect results from the covalent bonding between C and surface Si atoms, modifying the œÄ-orbital network of the graphene layer. The local density of states shows that the bonded C and Si surface states are highly disturbed near the Fermi energy. Comparison with nanoribbon If the in-plane direction is confined, in which case it is referred to as a nanoribbon, its electronic structure is different. If it is \\"zig-zag\\", the bandgap is zero. If it is \\"armchair\\", the bandgap is non-zero (see figure). GNR band structure for zig-zag orientation. Tightbinding calculations show that zig-zag orientation is always metallic. GNR band structure for armchair orientation. Tightbinding calculations show that armchair orientation can be semiconducting or metallic depending on width (chirality).

It portrays a young girl named Karen Reyes investigating the death of her neighbor in 1960s Chicago. Ferris started working on the graphic novel after contracting West Nile virus and becoming paralyzed at age 40\\\\. She attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago for writing and began the graphic novel to help her recover in 2010, taking six years to create 700 pages. The graphic novel draws on Ferris's childhood growing up in Chicago, and her love of monsters and horror media. The process of creating the work was difficult, with Ferris working long hours and living very frugally, and publishing met setbacks such as Ferris needing to find a new publisher and the first volume's printing being temporarily seized en route at the Panama Canal. The first volume was published by Fantagraphics on February 14, 2017. The graphic novel won the 2017 Ignatz Award for \\"Outstanding Graphic Novel\\" and three 2018 Eisner Awards, and was nominated for a 2018 Hugo Award. The French edition won the ACBD's Prix de la critique and the Fauve D'Or at the 2019 Angoul√™me International Comics Festival. My Favorite Thing Is Monsters has received critical acclaim and is considered by many critics to be one of the best graphic novels of 2017. A related freebie that Ferris created for Free Comic Book Day was also nominated for a 2020 Eisner Award.  Production  The graphic novel is presented as a personal diary in a lined spiral notebook Prior to working in comics, Ferris was a freelance illustrator and toy designer. After contracting West Nile virus at age 40 in 2002, Ferris became paralyzed from the waist down and lost the use of her right hand, preventing her from drawing and doing freelance work. The origin for My Favorite Thing Is Monsters was a screenplay Ferris wrote of \\"a werewolf lesbian girl being enfolded into the protective arms of a Frankenstein trans kid\\". The theme of two outsiders was then carried over to a short story she wrote in 2004. While attending the School of the Art Institute of Chicago for an M.F.A. in creative writing, Ferris taught herself drawing again and began work on My Favorite Thing Is Monsters to recover. Starting in 2010, it took Ferris six years to complete the manuscript. Her thesis formed the first 24 pages of the graphic novel and secured her a publisher. Ferris often worked 16-hour days and lived very frugally while working on the graphic novel. She averaged a rate of around a page every two days. Ferris said that the drawing process required effort to manipulate her drawing hand properly, which, even after recovery, did not regain the same dexterity. My Favorite Thing Is Monsters was mainly drawn using a Bic ballpoint pen and text written with Paper Mate's felt tip Flair pen. As drawing directly on notebook paper made corrections difficult, Ferris used a drawing layer over a notebook layer. Ferris did not use outlines while drawing, instead letting images that were evoked collect visually in her head. The presentation of the graphic novel as a spiral-bound diary was an autobiographical aspect, with Ferris's classmates always passing around her notebooks. Ferris eschewed panels because she felt that she needed freedom and that readers needed a visually dense experience.  Influences  Many aspects of the graphic novel are inspired by Ferris's childhood. Ferris was obsessed with monsters as a child, eagerly looking forward to Creature Features on Saturday nights, which had monsters she would weep for. Ferris had scoliosis, and to get attention on the playground, she told ghost and horror stories. The protagonist Karen's portrayal as a werewolf reflects how Ferris saw herself as a child‚Äîobserving the oppressive social role her beautiful mother, as well as other humans, had to play. The graphic novel is set in Chicago during the late 1960s, and Ferris grew up in Chicago's Uptown neighborhood. Her parents were both artists, and she would often visit their alma mater, the Art Institute of Chicago, which is featured in the graphic novel. As a child, Ferris was part of a theatrical troupe near the Graceland Cemetery‚Äîwhich she visited hoping to find monsters or a ghost‚Äîand the graphic novel includes the Eternal Silence sculpture from the cemetery. Ferris gained an understanding of World War II by talking to the Holocaust survivors who lived in the neighborhood of Rogers Park which she had moved to. She would visit the owner of a gallery who had an identification number tattoo, as well as talk to elderly survivors, forming a connection between their experiences and monsters. Francisco Goya was a childhood influence on Ferris. Pictured is his etching, The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters. In terms of artistic influences, Ferris was exposed to the works of Francisco Goya and Honor√© Daumier as a child, as well as Collier's Illustrated Dickens. The latter's \\"articulated and atmospheric\\" drawings were an experience that Ferris wanted to replicate. Cartoonists who were influences for her were Robert Crumb, Alison Bechdel, and Art Spiegelman. She has also cited horror film posters and stories from EC Comics as influences for the mock covers.  Publication  While halfway through work on My Favorite Thing Is Monsters, Ferris had to find a new publisher when the first one, Other Press, said it was too large and that they could not properly market it. After receiving 48 rejections for 50 submissions, the graphic novel was picked up by Fantagraphics. The graphic novel was originally over 700 pages, but Fantagraphics split it into two volumes to keep the price reasonable. Publication was set for October 31, 2016, to coincide with Halloween. In October, the ship containing the print run of the graphic novel‚Äî10,000 copies‚Äîwas seized at the Panama Canal due to the freight company, Hanjin Shipping, having gone bankrupt. While the ship was released by the Panamanian government later that month, publication was still delayed due to the media campaign being pushed to February 2017 in anticipation of a required reprint. The first volume of the graphic novel was published by Fantagraphics on February 14, 2017. In March 2017, the graphic novel received a second print run of 30,000 copies, the largest second printing Fantagraphics had ever done. In March 2017, Sony Pictures won an auction for the film rights to the graphic novel, with Amasia Entertainment's Bradley Gallo and Michael Helfant producing. Sam Mendes was in early talks to possibly direct. On November 3, 2016, in order to raise funds for the second volume of the graphic novel and a new computer, Ferris ran a crowdfunding campaign on GoFundMe, raising $11,000. The second volume will receive an initial print run of 30,000 copies and was originally slated for an October 2017 release. The graphic novel has also been published in France by Monsieur Toussaint Louverture, in Canada by √âditions Alto, in Italy by Bao Publishing, in Spain by Reservoir Books, and in Germany by Panini. For Free Comic Book Day on May 5, 2019, Ferris created Our Favorite Thing is My Favorite Thing is Monsters. It contained an original 16-page monster story, as well as the autobiographical \\"The Bite That Changed My Life\\" and \\"How To Draw a Monster\\".  Reception  Art Spiegelman, author of Maus, has praised the graphic novel. When Spiegelman‚Äîwho Ferris has cited as an influence‚Äîtold Ferris that he loved it, she \\"started crying like a big dumb baby.\\" My Favorite Thing Is Monsters has been critically acclaimed. Reviewers for the graphic novel have noted the quality of Ferris's artwork and writing compared to her inexperience in comics publishing. Douglas Wolk of The New York Times said that Ferris has a \\"portraitist's skill with tiny subtleties of expression and lighting and a New Objectivist's eye for the raw grotesquerie of bodies and their surroundings\\". The graphic novel has also been received positively by other notable comics artists. Art Spiegelman told The New York Times that Ferris is \\"one of the most important comics artists of our time\\" and that she \\"uses the sketchbook idea as a way to change the grammar and syntax of the comics page\\". The cover of the graphic novel also features praise from Chris Ware and Alison Bechdel. Paul Tumey of The Comics Journal compared the cross-hatching used to \\"both vividly delineate detailed forms and evoke a wide palette of emotion\\" to the work of Robert Crumb and likening the graphic novel to a patchwork quilt he owns, called it \\"weird, unique, [and] lovingly crafted from caring and devotion\\". Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club called the graphic novel a masterpiece, saying that it stands out against contemporary graphic novels with its \\"visual splendor, narrative ingenuity, and emotional impact\\", concluding that \\"Ferris immediately establishes herself as one of the most exciting, provocative talents in the comics industry\\". John Powers of NPR said that \\"for all its stylistic tour-de-forciness, My Favorite Thing Is Monsters is filled with emotion\\", finding that \\"every page feels like it's been secreted from the very core of [Ferris's] being\\". My Favorite Thing Is Monsters has charted on the Publishers Weekly graphic novel best seller list. The graphic novel garnered three nominations at the 2017 Ignatz Awards‚Äî\\"Outstanding Artist\\" for Ferris; \\"Outstanding Graphic Novel\\" and \\"Outstanding Story\\" for the graphic novel‚Äîwinning \\"Outstanding Artist\\" and \\"Outstanding Graphic Novel\\". The graphic novel was nominated for five 2018 Eisner Awards: \\"Best Graphic Album‚ÄìNew\\", \\"Best Writer/Artist\\", \\"Best Coloring\\", \\"Best Lettering\\", and \\"Best Publication Design\\". It won \\"Best Graphic Album‚ÄìNew\\", \\"Best Writer/Artist\\", and \\"Best Coloring\\". It was also nominated for a Hugo Award for \\"Best Graphic Story\\" in 2018. It won a Division Award from the National Cartoonists Society for Graphic Novels. It also won in the category \\"LGBTQ Graphic Novel\\" at the 30th Lambda Literary Awards in 2018. The French edition won the ACBD's Prix de la critique 2019, as well as the Fauve D'Or at the 2019 Angoul√™me International Comics Festival. The graphic novel has been considered by many critics as one of the best of 2017 at: The New York Times, Publishers Weekly, Comic Book Resources, The A.V. Club, and The Comics Journal. In a tabulation of 136 \\"Best Comics of 2017\\" lists, My Favorite Thing Is Monsters received the most mentions.

Kinsey, 15 August 2019 The Commission of the Yellow Rose of Texas, commonly referred to as the Yellow Rose of Texas, is an honorary commission conferred by the Governor of Texas to Texas women for exceptional community service.  History   Genesis  The award was conceived and inaugurated by Governor Allan Shivers before the end of his second term in 1957. The Yellow Rose of Texas Commission is the highest award bestowed to women by the Texas Governor.  Etymology  The award name, \\"Yellow Rose of Texas,\\" was chosen by Governor Shivers to honor the woman known by that name, Emily Morgan, who as a 20-year-old slave, according to legend, was instrumental in the victory of the Battle of San Jacinto, which, reportedly lasted 18 minutes, which, in turn, sealed the fate for Texas independence. The Texas Rose Festival in Tyler has named a Rose Queen since its inception in 1933, and historically, the title was \\"Miss Yellow Rose of Texas.\\" In 1955, band leader Mitch Miller and His Orchestra recorded \\"The Yellow Rose of Texas\\" (the song) on Columbia Records, which became a hit. That same year, during a ceremony in Dallas honoring Miller as an honorary Texan, Miller announced Maymerle Shirley (later known as Maymerle Brown; 1936‚Äì2017) as \\"Miss Yellow Rose of Texas\\" for 1955.  Eligibility  The Yellow Rose of Texas recognizes exceptional community service such as: volunteerism, charitable contributions, achievements related to the preservation of the history of Texas, or achievements toward improving the present and building the future.

The paper was originally named \\"Aegis\\" in reference to Zeus' shield in Greek mythology, and was meant to \\"evoke protection for the interests of Harford residents\\" as well as reflect the founding paper's Southern sympathies. Its initial publisher, Frederick W. Baker, became notorious for his controversial editorial positions such as violent opposition to African American advancement under Reconstruction. During this period, The Aegis & Intelligencer \\"could be counted upon to be anti-black and conservatively Democratic at all times.\\" However, the paper also recorded the increasing economic growth of Bel Air and published stories documenting the construction of the Maryland Central Railroad in 1883 and the arrival of the American Union Telegraph Company in 1880. Baker sold the paper to Frank E. Gorrell in 1894, who in turn sold it to Walter Finney and Louis Dashiell in 1899. The newspaper was then purchased by John D. Worthington, Sr. in 1904, and he simplified the name of the newspaper to The Aegis in 1923. In 1986, the Times Mirror Company, then-owner of The Baltimore Sun, purchased The Aegis, and the newspaper continues its run to this day.

Nathaniel was born in the workhouse on the fifth of June 1826. He was christened Nathaniel White on 4 July 1826. His father was also Nathaniel White, a pauper. Whilst little more is known of his early life, it is known he worked as an errand boy and for an undertaker, which may explain his fascination with death and almost weekly visits to cemeteries and graveyards. He wrote his diary when aged 19, while working as a clerk in a Lea's coal wharf, close to Buckingham Palace Road today and later became a clerk, an accountant and a book store owner. Although he makes references to other diaries, the only one to survive covers the majority of 1846, from 1 January to 12 December. A single entry from his 1848 journal survives as it was referenced in 'Notes and Queries: For Readers and Writers, Collectors and Librarians' in 1914. The diary is also interesting in the relationships that he holds with the women. His ailing mother Mary, his obsession with John Bunyan descendant Mary Sanigear (referred to as Mrs Skirricker in the diary) his girlfriend Ann Fox, a charwoman, who was twenty six years his senior, and his beloved grandmother, \\"Granny\\" Sheppard. The diary is also notable for the colourful and graphic attempts he makes at intimacy with the latter, written in shorthand to hide the explicit content. Bryceson married Sarah Clark in 1854, by whom he had at least seven children, four of whom survived to adulthood. His only surviving, handwritten diary was bought for the sum of ¬£115 in 1974 by Westminster council from a collector by the name of Miss Myers and, whilst some of it had fallen victim to water damage, the majority of it was eventually released online in 2010 by a group of archivist volunteers. It was later serialised as a daily blog. His wife Sarah died in 1890. Nathaniel Bryceson himself died in Stepney, at his daughter's house at 102 Dempsey St, on 23rd March, 1911 at the age of 84 and was buried in Islington Cemetery, Finchley with his wife Sarah and son Nathaniel who died in February 1911.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. History Alvin T. Lanphere was born in 1834, and manufactured lightning rods in Coldwater. In about 1870, he began work constructing this house. By 1875, the house was reportedly not completely finished, and Lanphere exchanged houses with Jacob Franklin Pratt. (note: large pdf file) Pratt was born in 1829, and moved to Coldwater in about 1855. Pratt was part-owner in a tannery and in a boot manufacturer. Later, Pratt founded the Coldwater Cutter Company, which manufactured sleighs and children's sleds. Pratt lived in this house until his death in 1907. Pratt's son, Allen J. Pratt, inherited the house, and also became president of the Coldwater Cutter Company. Allen Pratt lived in this house until 1933, when the firm went bankrupt. In 1934, Alfred G. Morency, the owner of a brass works, purchased the house. The Morency family lived in the house until 1963. Mr. and Mrs, Gerald Zavitz purchased the house in 1975. Description The Lanphere-Pratt House is a two-story red brick Italianate structure on a sandstone foundation measuring 40 feet by 60 feet. The house consists of a rectangular front section and a narrower rear ell with flanking porches. A front veranda covers the entryway. A three-story tower fronts the main facade, with the central entrance in the base of the tower. Paired roundhead windows trimmed with sandstone are on each story, and a pediment above the second floor windows breaks the eave line. The shallow hip roof is supported with massive brackets. On the interior, the first floor contains a central hall extending the length of the house to the rear kitchen. The main public rooms, two front parlors, are off the hall and reached through sliding doors. The first floor also contains a dining room, study, a bath, and another smaller room.

Port of Wisbech is an inland port on the River Nene in Wisbech, Isle of Ely, Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom. It is mainly used for cargo and industrial purposes, the southern part of the port houses a number of berths for yachts. Fenland District Council is the harbour authority for most of the River Nene, as well as operating the port and harbour, it provide a Port Health service to commercial ships, leisure craft and fishing vessels. Regular shipments to and from and continental Europe, mostly timber and forest goods from Baltic states.  History  Wisbech served as a port in medieval times. After the estuary of the River Ouse became silted up, it was diverted into the sea at King's Lynn. This led to the construction of the present course of the River Nene from Peterborough to the Wash. The drained marshes provided rich productive farmland, bringing prosperity to the port of Wisbech from the regular shipments of corn and oil seed rape to the coast and continent, and imports which included coal from the North, slate from Wales and timber from the Baltic. Woad (Isatis tinctoria) was shipped out from the port. Inevitably some trade was carried out illicitly. 'By the General Pilot Act of the fifty second of George III, masters of vessels piloted or conducted by any other than a Licensed Pilot, are liable to forfeit double the amount of the Pilotage, and also a penalty Five Pounds for every fifty tons burthen and persons taking charge vessels or acting Pilots without being duly licensed, or without having registered their licences with the proper Officer of the Customs, are liable to a penally of ¬£50'. NOTICE IS HEREBY ALSO GIVEN That the following persons, viz. Kirby Wilson (Headsman,) Stephen Belton. Henry Hayes Jnr Joseph Smith, William Smith, Thomas Cameron, Robert Bouch, and Jeremiah Bouch, all residing at Sutton Washway, within the Port of Wisbech, are appointed and duly licensed act Pilots for the Port and Harbour of Wisbech aforesaid, and the adjoining Coasts thereof, and that no other persons are duly licensed or can lawfully act as Pilots for the said Port and Harbour, and that all licences heretofore granted to other persons are determined and void. By Order of the Sub-Commissioners of Pilotage, Bellamy. Girdlestone, & Bellamy. Wisbech 28 August 1813. Alderman Richard Young (MP) JP DL, MP was the owner of over 40 ships in the 19th century. In the latter part of the 19th century American vessels visited the port. In 1827 the bill for the improvement of the River Nene Outfall was at committee stage in the House of Commons. On 12 October 1832 the Cambridge Chronicle reported 'The river that runs through this town, in consequence of the great outfall, was so low last week, that the stones on its bed, under the bridge, were visible and dry at low water'. Mr Cook, a sailmaker (died 1834) was just one of the many craftsmen supporting ship building in the town, there were also at least two ropewalks. By 1838 the river level was sufficient to allow the port to receive the largest vessel ever to enter the River Nene; a vessel from Prussia over 300 tons burthen, with a full load of timber. In May 1839 the steam towing company were advertising to purchase one or two steam tugs. In 1841 the boatbuilder James Mill was declared bankrupt and his yard and contents auctioned March 17 & 18 In 1844 the harbour master was Mr. J.S.Buckley, he was also the Lloyd's agent. In 1845 the port was advertising for tenders from contractors able to construct a wharf, warehouse and crane. In the past the unloading of smaller vesssels able to pass under the town bridge took place further upstream than it does currently. In 1848 it was reported that 'the wharf on the South Brink road had sunk considerably further during the past week and the probability is that the communication by this road will be entirely cut off before long. The road is at present fenced off, allowing only the passage of one vehicle at a time'. In 1850 the Wisbech steam-tug company was dissolved and their three vessels the Middlesboro, Samson and the Don sold. In the latter part of the 19th century American vessels visited the port. 'PORT OF WISBECH. ‚Äî NOTICE is hereby given, that the TONNAGE DUTY Sixpence per ton, granted by the New Outfall Act on goods shipped to and from the port of Wisbech, has CEASED by payment of the debt charged thereon by the Corporation of Wisbech under the powers of the said act, and that the only tonnage duty now payable to the said Corporation, is Three Pence per Ton, under the provisions of the original Port and Harbour Act. WM. STEVENS, Mayor. Wisbech. 25 May 1847.' Appeared in the press in 1847. A Scheme to improve the River Nene from Northampton to Wisbech by new cuts, widening, construction of weirs or overfalls, and new bridges at Nene Quay, Wisbech, and the Dog-in-a- Doublet public house, Whittlesey was included in the Nene Valley Drainage and Navigation Improvement Act 1852. PORT OF WISBECH SAILORS' SOCIETY ANNIVERSARY. This anniversary meeting, which took place on Thursday 26 April 1855. Mr. Robert Clarke in appropriate address, alluded to the losses the Society had sustained during the past year, having lost its President (Capt. Schultz, R.N.) & the Rev. W. Holmes, Secretarv. However he was happily gratified to be able to announce to the meeting that Edward J. Fraser, Esq., had kindly consented to take the office of President, the duties of which he doubted not he would discharge with assiduity and zeal. But, as it was to assist in putting matters in the port of Wisbech with regard to sailors in better state, these required his particular attention. Mr Fieldwick, from what he had learned since his arrival in Wisbech, it appeared there are 210 vessels belonging to the port, besides 80 foreign vessels that trade. The society had regularly visited 160 sailors' families residing in Wisbech, besides having paid 200 visits to vessels in the river during the year, and holding services in the Bethel, which were generally well attended and often crowded. Ship- owners in 1864, held a meeting at the Exchange-hall, Wisbech, on 6 November, for the purpose of establishing a society to be called the Wisbech Union Marine Association, for insuring ships belonging to the port of Wisbech, the policies not to exceed four hundred pounds on large vessels, or more than two thirds of the value of small vessels. The chair was taken by George Prest, Esq., and resolutions were unanimously carried for immediately establishing the society. The Wisbech & Isle of Ely Gazette report in 1865 reflected the upturn in the port. \\"WISBECH. ‚ÄîThe Port.‚ÄîWe are rather pleased to learn that the foreign trade of the port is rapidly growing in extent, the past year being considerably in advance of any previous year-no less than 158 ships‚Äîwith cargoes from abroad, having been entered inwards at the Customhouse during the year. The year 1863 showed a large increase, whilst in the year just closed there were not less than 31 ships more than in 1863. The tonnage account for the past year must have been great, as some of the ships were of large burthen, several of them ranging from 500 to 900 tons. Since the new year dawned, several ships have arrived from the Baltic ports, laden with deals, sleepers &c; , and which ships were in the Eye several days before the expiration of the year just closed. The trade with Hull is also satisfactorily becoming developed, as, within the last ten days, three steamers have arrived, laden with general merchandize, and next week another screw steamer, named the Fruiterei, the same being a new vessel, will run regularly between this place and Hull. The river is in a capital state, in fact never better, and all old prejudices against the port are now banished. Although the trade of the port shows such a satisfactory result for the past year, we feel confident that there will be much greater increase during the present year, for it must not be forgotten that at the commencement of the past season the Danish War (Second Schleswig War) had such an effect upon the shipping, that merchants experienced the greatest difficulty in procuring ships to bring over cargoes from the Baltic, and, to our own knowledge, there are several cargoes of wood now at Wyburg and other ports, belonging to merchants of this place, and which could not be brought here, owing to the war and the scarcity of ships. We have no doubt the above facts will be read with pleasure by those who take an interest in the port of Wisbech.\\" In 1868 the port was advertising for a new Harbour Master at a salary of ¬£50 pa. In December 1877 a scheme commenced to construct a dock at Sutton Bridge, Lincolnshire commenced. This came under the jurisdiction of Wisbech Port authority. In May 1881 the Sutton Bridge Dock was nearing completion and the Garland arrived to unload a shipment of timber. The Dock at Sutton Bridge suffered further subsidence in June 1881. The Port Authority were responsible for the maintenance of navigation aids. In 1897 this was the Borough council and they placed a notice in Lloyd's list that recent gales had destroyed a beacon and that a temporary replacement had been installed. Wisbech is described as \\"a thriving seaport, importing Baltic timber, cereals, iron, and coal, and a seat of important factories, breweries, steam saw and flour mills, printing works, and roperies\\" in 1899. In 1935 the Hansa en route with 1600 tonnes of timber ran into severe storms, the waterlogged timber had to be jettisoned to avoid the ship keeling over. It ran aground moving up the River Nene and more cargo was disposed off. Unfortunately the port was closed for a week due to the loose timber floating in the river. During the Spanish Civil War, Wisbech Port was used to send a food ship to run the blockade and bring humanitarian aid to those in the Republican areas. SS Stangate was the first Eastern Counties Foodship and carried over ¬£1000 of food. It was announced in 1947 that 'Lighting the way to the inland port of Wisbech, four new beacons have been built at the River Nene's mouth.' In 1969 the port claimed to be able to accommodate vessels of up to 16 ft draft on Spring tides with length of 240 ft using 5 mobile cranes. In 2004 the port was taken over by Fenland District Council.  Ships  The St. Anthony, Capt. Traver, bound from Wisbech to Lisbon, was lost on the Coast of Portugal in January 1736. In April 1737 Mr. Joseph Southgate, Commander of the Sloop in the Service of the Customs, having met with a smuggling boat near Fosdyke, Wash, which were loaded with Tea and other prohibited Goods, whereof John Ransford of Wisbech Master...seized ...and Master and men committed to Norwich Castle. In July 1740 a coasting vessel, laden with 1,400 quarters of barley, bound for Calais from Wisbech, was seized and brought into the Port of London, sufficient proof having been made that the said barley was designed for sale in foreign parts. On 1 November 1740 the Four Sisters, bound from Wisbech to London, was lost in the storm near Wells, Norfolk, the Master of whom, Robert Smith, and his Mate drown'd. Escape of local prisoners of war held in the city of Lugo in Galicia, captured on the Ellen master Peter Raoul, of London taken on 17 March 1741. Robert Johnson and Robert Harrison of Wisbech, Samuel Sanders of Lynn and other sailors made their escape on 6 June 1741. 11 October 1747 the Middleham, Capt. Peter Harper, of 120 Tons and but two Carriage Guns; en route with coals from Sunderland was attacked about two leagues off Scarborough by a French Privateer. Considerable damage from cannon and boarders was sustained. In 1824 the Peterboro' and Wisbech Nene Packet was advertised as running leaving the city on Tuesdays and Fridays, and the town Wednesdays and Sundays. In 1826 as a result of the bankruptcy of James Hill (banker) the elder and James Hill the younger, their shares in vessels were put up for sale: The sloops Liberty, Eagle, Rambler, Thuristone and Exchange. In 1834 it was reported that the Nene was the fourth Wisbech vessel lost since the August gale. The sloop James Moorhouse en route to Wisbech with a cargo of lime took fire and sank near to the Bar Buoy in July 1837. It is thought that water got amongst the lime. A schooner of about 100 tons register, belonging to Captain Turner of this port was launched from the dock-yard of Mr. Henson. She was christened the Seven H's on 22 November 1838. The 64 ton schooner Wansford was launched from the yard of Messrs. Bannisters and Henson, Wisbech on 27 June 1839. In 1840 the sloop Rover was put for sale as a result of the bankruptcy of James Hill (banker) and Thomas Hill. Shipbuilding took place on the banks of the river below the town bridge. In 1841 a fine sloop, the property of Captain Bagnall and bearing his name, was launched from the yard of Mr. Bannister. The lifeboat from Skegness rescued the crew of the Jane of Wisbech from their sinking ship off Friskney In the same year the schooner ‚Äò‚ÄôHuzza‚Äô‚Äô property of Richard Young (MP), was wrecked off Hartlepool in a heavy gale, all hands were saved, rescued by the 'rocket' apparatus, this may have been the first time the device was used to save sailors. In 1844 the launch of a sloop named the Bounty of Providence took place from Bannister's shipyard. In August 1844 the Agenaria was launched from Mr. Bannister's dockyard. The Zephyr belonging to Mr. Hewitt was wrecked off Boulogne in a gale in 1843 The ship Venice, Mr. Matthew Moore, master, of Wisbech was reported lost with no survivors in 1846. In July 1848 the schooner Bagnall master Mr. Yorke, was reported lost off Blakeney en route to London, all were saved except the master, Mr Yorke and his wife. In January 1849 the schooner Britannia captain Horsfield, on a passage to Sunderland laden with iron and carrots was wrecked.

In January 1850 Richard Young's Wisbech built vessel the Tycho Wingran aground in a storm off Falmouth and was wrecked. The captain and three of the crew of the newly built vessel being drowned. In March 1850 Mr E. Cross's Wisbech schooner Violet was reported wrecked off Hartlepool. Correspondence in the Mecantile and Shipping Gazette indicates that the Violet was got off the beach successfully. June 1850 saw the Harriet Emma, master Mr. Lundie collide with another vessel in fog off the Yorkshire coast, both vessels sinking and only two of the crew of the Wisbech craft survived to be picked up later by the Prince Albert of Jersey. Three Wisbech vessels were believed lost with all hands in the gale of 25 September 1851, the sloop Brothers, George Waddingham, master; Charles and William, William Good, master; Rose in June, Joseph Plant, master. The whereabouts of the three survivors is uncertain. It is said that they have been bought on speculation at $30 each, and the purchaser demands $4000 each for their ransom. Edward Bailey Cross died of cholera in captivity, Thomas Layton died from his wounds and Emanuel Francis was confirmed shot dead. On 8 October 1854 the brig Magnet of Wisbech, Mr. W Lowe, master, laden with wheat to Antwerp, was driven onto the Werthender, 12 miles East of Dunkerk, the ship was lost, all the crew survived. A new fishing smack the Arrow belonging to Mr Lemon of Lynn, was launched from the yard of Mr.King on Friday 16 November 1855. The Brig Friends one of the oldest vessels belonging to this port, left Harburg on 18 November and has not been heard of since. It is feared the ship and crew are lost. In December, 1854 Young's vessels the Lady Alice Lambton and Great Northern were leased for use in the Crimean War and the newly built Sir Colin Campbell sold to the Turkish government and bought back at the end of the war. Mr JM. Cordell MRCS surgeon served on board the screw steamer Great Northern during the Crimean War. In 1861 he was appointed surgeon to the Salisbury Infirmary. In 1855 Richard Young's barque the Nene Valley captain Mr. Robert Baldwin left London on 19 October was run ashore in Northumberland Bay, Australia with all sails set on 19 October. The captain, passengers and crew except four were saved. His vessel Wisbech was lost on her first voyage. In Arthur Oldham's book A History of Wisbech River he writes \\"the three surviving sons of Richard Young who state definitely that she was lost whilst running the North American blockade of the Southern Ports - probably near Charleston\\". Another of his ships the Great Northern was chartered for the Crimean War. In November 1855 Richard Young's vessel, the Hebe captain James Burton, bringing coals from Sunderland sprang a leak and was beached without loss of life near Filey. At Filey By JAMES RICHARDSON. At FOORD'S HOTEL, On Wednesday, 7 November 1855, at One o'clock, The Brig HEBE, of Wisbech, 220 tons burthen, seven years old, as she now lies on the Beach in Bay, with all her stores. The ship appears to have sustained but little damage, and is an excellent coaster. On 3 September 1856 the schooner Redstart was launched from Hinson's yard and towed to Boston for rigging, and a week later, the schooner Imperial Prince of Messrs. Hayley and Buckley was launched from the yard of Mr.T. Meadows. Young's Rechid Pasha arrived in the port for the first time. Originally built as the Sir Colin Campbell as a sister ship to the Florence Nightingale she was purchased by the Turkish government and later bought back. The brig Stevens, of this port, the property of W Stevens, from London to Wyborg, in ballast, was totally wrecked on the island of Herman, near Lysekill, on 27 September 1856, without loss of life. In a gale in early March, 1858 two of Young's vessels had stormy passages. The Planet was badly damaged off Flamborough Head Light, the captain and crew members injured before they could get the vessel into Scarborough. The Hebe bound from Sunderland to her home port suffered damage and loss of sails before also gaining a safe haven at Scarborough. The Florence Nightingale which had been reported lost, made port at Tonning at the end of July, much the worse for wear from the heavy gale, captain Lee had been washed overboard but still clinging to a rope was washed back on board. In October 1858 Richard Young's on board his vessel SS Great Northern fired one its guns as a salute as it passed his residence, Osborne House, injuring Joseph Higgins a crew member and smashing house windows on both sides of the river. The same week Young's son Frederick fell on a scythe badly injuring his thigh. On 21 October 1859 at night off Beachy Head, the brig Agatha of Lynn struck William Stevens's barque Briton of Wisbech, captain Byford, holing her below the waterline, the crews efforts kept the vessel afloat until it was towed into Sheerness. In December 1859 Richard Young's brig Sutton Bridge, Charles Fox, master, laden with timber from Memel to Wisbech, grounded at Bornholm, the master, mate and second mate drowning and five hands saved. The same month Richard Young himself was nearly killed in a cab crash in London, reported in the same paper. Ridlington's Boston schooner Blue Jacket was launched from Mr. John Henson's yard in May 1860, unusually followed by another of the same name belonging to Mr G. Haley of Wisbech, from Mr. Meadow's yard in June. 30 June 1860 the sloop Union(the property of Mr Noah Pinder, harbourmaster) from Stockton for Brussels with clay, foundered off Caister, but three hands, master's wife and child were all saved by the lugger, Refuge, Varley. 1861 Richard Young's screw steamer Florence Nightingale was entering Sunderland Harbour when one of the crew fell into the hold and was killed. The same year the first vessel from the U.S.A. to enter Wisbech port, a barque Gallego laden with 2,600 quarters of barley arrived from Sulina. The Wisbech Chronicle reported on the death on 2 January 1862 of Captain Daniel Rowe, of Richard Young's brig Robert James Haynes he died at Lynn of natural causes. In September, 1862 the Lady Alice Lambton, was run down a few miles below the Nore in the fog of Sunday morning week. She was coming from Sunderland heavily laden with coal, and had arrived far on her voyage when she was run into by the Henry Morton, steamer, going down in ballast. Little was known of the accident for some time, and great fears were entertained for the safety of her crew; but a telegram was received intimating that the Lady Alice Lambton had sunk, but that her crew had been taken off by the Henry Morton, which had afterwards arrived safely. In 1863 It appears from the Shipping lie that the screw-steam ship Florence Nightingale (Captain Lee), the property of R. Young, Esq., Mayor of Wisbech, encountered a severe gale off Trevose Head on Wednesday morning 26th ult., on her passage from Cardiff to Woolwich, and losing her foremast and head lights, was obliged to put into Plymouth Sound for repairs. In November, 1864 the Julia of this port, owner Mr. Prest, en route from Shields to Wisbech with coal for the gas works sprang a leak in a gale. The crew kept her afloat until taken in tow by a Leith screw Steamer Morna into Hartlepool. Another of Prest's vessels the Zuma bound from Antwerp to Santander was reported with a broken bowsprit. The barque Richard Young foundered without loss of life en route with coals from Shields to Kronstadt in 1864. In 1865 the Wisbech barque City of Peterborough was lost with all hands in a gale off the Cape of Good Hope.Attempts at rescue with by means of Manby's apparatus were made without success. Young purchased second hand the auxiliary steam ship Robert Lowe' in 1865. It had been used by Florence Nightingale in the Crimea, another new vessel being built at Sunderland was nearing completion. Young's three years old Screw Steamer Newton Colvile commanded by captain Thomas Lee was lost with all 18 hands off Copenhagen during a gale in January 1867 en route from Danzig to London. In April 1867 the sloop Planet, Captain Ridgeway, of Wisbech (ballast) was run into at half- past eleven, near Flamborough Head, by the schooner Rifleman, of Teignmouth, and was abandoned in a sinking state without loss of life. The Julia was wrecked in the Firth of Forth without loss of life in 1869. About 1872 the Lynn brig Arab sank in the river opposite Mills Brewery, the ship was a former slave trader. The brig Robert James Haynes, of Wisbech, foundered in the North Sea on the 16th. It appears that she left the port of Sunderland on the 12th inst., coal laden, bound for Copenhagen, and after being a few hours at sea fell in with heavy gales from the NNW, which caused her to spring a severe leak, the consequence of which was that, although all hands laboured day and night at the pumps, the water so gained upon her that she was found to be rapidly settling down on the 16th, her bulwarks, binnacle, and skylights having been swept away. At this critical moment, when there appeared to be no hope for the unfortunate crew, the screw steamer May hove in sight, and after signalling her, the brig's crew took to the boat, and were all safely taken on board. In December 1877 the Ocean, of Wisbech, Curson, from Shields, for Brest, was reported as having been assisted into Ramsgate, leaky and with sails and bulwarks gone. In December 1878 the steamer Ethel was icebound in Wisbech port and three other inbound vessels with linseed for the Wisbech oil mills lying at Sutton Bridge waiting for clear passage, the Economy of Wisbech, from Poole to Middlesboro' with a cargo of iron, was assisted into Great Yarmouth derelict and dismantled. The conditions enabled skating matches to take place. A skating match on the Saturday was won by 'Turkey' Smart. Wisbech. ‚Äî On Monday 1887, the Talley Abbey, a fine steamer, with wood from Zomea for Messrs. English Bros., arrived at Wisbech in command of Capt. Arkley. The vessel is largest that has yet come to Wisbech, both as to tonnage and length. Her registered tonnage is 608, which is 81 tons more than the Regent, and her capacity is estimated at 1000 tons of cargo. She measures in length 214 1/2 ft or 19 1/2 ft longer than the Regent, and has a beam of 31 ft. 2in. She was brought up on second lift of the tide, with the assistance of the tug Pendennis, without the slightest difficulty. Her cargo is 400 standards of wood. In November 1893 the Wisbech steam-tug Pendennis rescued survivors of the crew from the schooner Tankerton Tower of Faversham. The vessel being wrecked in the gale, four of the crew had lashed themselves to the rigging, three were got off alive. HMS Sprat, the Royal Navy's Stickleback class midget submarine sailed through the port en route to and from Peterborough. The Wisbech dockers ended their strike over pay rates for handling sugar sacks. The 52 foot cruiser Halekulani was launched on 23 September 1961, its first voyage was to go to Paris.  Tonnage  Records for import and export of various trades were compiled by Arthur Oldham from port records and newspapers for his book. In 1805 duties were received on 29,242 tonnes this had risen to 152,262 tonnes by 1849. His manuscript is held at Wisbech & Fenland Museum  The Port Today  Approx annual tonnage: 800,000. Connections to major transport links - A17, A47 east coast to A1/M1 carriageway. The port runs a fortnightly service from Riga, Latvia importing from the Baltic.

It is found in the northern Atlantic Ocean and the northern Pacific Ocean. It occurs on the lower shore down to about , on sand or gravel, under stones and among seaweed. Description Like other ribbon worms, T. polymorphus is not divided into segments but is soft, smooth and contractile. It is up to long but just wide, with a rounded head slightly broader than the body. There is a proboscis pore and a mouth on the underside of the head but there are no eye- spots or cephalic slits. Fresh specimens are a dark reddish-brown or orangeish-brown. Specimens preserved in alcohol lose their colour but exhibit a transverse dark band. This has a clear cut anterior margin but a posterior margin that fades gradually. A pair of sensory organs is located at the sides near the posterior margin of this band. This worm can be distinguished from other similar species by the absence of whitish bands or stripes on the body or white patches on the head, as well as by certain muscle fibres crossing over muscle layers in the dorsal part of the body wall, but not in the ventral part. Distribution and habitat The species occurs in water at depths down to about in both the northern Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea and the northeastern Pacific Ocean. It is typically present on sand or gravel substrates, often under stones or among seaweeds or mussels. Ecology T. polymorphus is a carnivore. On encountering a worm, crustacean or other prey item, the proboscis is everted (turned inside out) through the proboscis pore. The proboscis winds around the prey and mucus and toxic secretions immobilise it. It is then passed to the mouth and swallowed whole, or if too large, digestive juices are secreted onto it and the semi-digested tissues are sucked into the mouth. The sexes are separate in this species. The females lay eggs which are fertilised externally and develop directly into juvenile worms. This ribbon worm is diurnal and makes little attempt to avoid predation. It is possible that its bright red colouration is aposemetic, giving warning that this particular ribbon worm is toxic or unpalatable. An alternative theory is that the colour may make the worm less visible to fish, which have colour vision, because the red wavelength light gets absorbed by the water and thus the worm appears dark.

The film was released on September 21, 2018, by Netflix. Plot A young girl Violet (Sanaa Lathan) talks about her mother Paulette (Lynn Whitfield) always making sure she looks perfect. This includes straightening her natural hair which takes time and occasionally Violet is burned by the iron. At a park, a boy says he can hold his breath longer underwater. Despite her mom‚Äôs protests Violet jumps in the swimming pool. When she surfaces her natural hair is wild and frizzy. Children make fun of her. Horrified, her mother puts her in the car. Later, Violet as an adult has a seemingly perfect life: she is successful in her job as an advertising executive, has been with her boyfriend Clint (Ricky Whittle), a doctor, for two years, and has perfect long straight hair, despite the effort it takes to maintain. Violet shares a close relationship with her mother, who continues keeping Violet the vision of perfection. She and Violet's father (Ernie Hudson) recently became estranged after he quit his job to pursue modeling. Violet expects Clint to propose on her birthday. After getting sprayed by the neighbor's hose, she visits a salon to attempt to get her hair fixed. The salonist makes a mistake; some of Violet‚Äôs hair falls out.

At Violet‚Äôs birthday party, Clint gives her a dog instead of a ring. Violet is highly disappointed when Clint doesn't propose. She confronts him later at home. He says she‚Äôs always perfect and doesn‚Äôt know much about her including her favorite things. Violet breaks up with him. He leaves.

At issue are Fifth Amendment protections of due process, information use, and equal protection. Plaintiffs claim damage in the form of \\"discriminatory treatment based on their national origin, without lawful justification.\\" Facts and prior history Obama administration Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano issued a memorandum establishing DACA on June 15, 2012. This policy protected certain undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children from arrest or detention based solely on their immigration status while deferred action was in effect. Participation was granted for two years with renewal possible. DACA grantees also got work authorizations and were eligible to receive Social Security, retirement, disability benefits, and, in certain states, benefits such as driver‚Äôs licenses or unemployment insurance. But several years later and in fulfillment of a Trump campaign promises made June 16, 2015 and August 31, 2016 the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke rescinded the Napolitano memo on September 5, 2017. The Trump administration then sent the program to Congress for rework within six months. The lawsuit seeks to maintain the protections extended to DACA grantees and to allow renewal and continued enrollment by eligible children.  Latest developments  The case was reassigned to judge Nicholas G. Garaufis, because it is related to Batalla Vidal et al. v. Baran et al., No. 1:16-cv-4756.

The pit was created by a rival company, The Forge Masters (la Soci√©t√© des ma√Ætres de forges), which had owned the hamlet of √âboulet's mines since 1851, fifteen years before the Ronchamp Mining Company acquired them. As its supply of coal dwindled, the mine was converted into a water well used for pumping water used in the mining process to several other nearby mines. The pit was plugged in 1958, when all the coal mines formerly owned by Ronchamp were closed by the government utility, √âlectricit√© de France. Three miner towns, a dormitory, and a reservoir of potable water were constructed around the mine pit in the interwar period. A slag heap towards the north remained until the beginning of the 20th century, leaving behind two slabs of concrete and the floor of a no longer existent building.  Excavation  The excavation of the pit was undertaken by the √âboulet Mining Company on December 14, 1851 with an area of 6.6m by 2.5m with a pair of 2m x 2m extraction compartments.. In 1855, 31 workers‚Äî21 miners, five assistants, two machinists and two blasters‚Äîworked in the 135-foot deep well . A year later, excavation was suspended at a depth of 270 meters in order to conduct a survey which determined the presence of coal at 495.54 meters. The 1st of August 1859, at 501 meters, the pit crossed a vein of coal 80 centimeters thick, which did not meet company standards . According to their surveys, they believed there must be coal at a depth of 550 to 600 meters, and moreover that there would be only one relatively thin vein. The engineers therefore assessed that the Notre-Dame excavations had run into a slab of the basin's bedrock . Explorations were rapidly undertaken and executed badly. Poor ventilation, in 1861, caused an explosion of methane which resulted in three deaths. The explorations were then stopped in order to rework the mine and its galleries, but above all to dig a ventilation shaft . In 1861 began the digging of the first ventilation shaft in the region. The fan-powered shaft was two meters in diameter, the shaft was placed 30 meters away from the mine shaft. On the January 2, 1862, three workers died of asphyxiation following an unexplained explosion at the bottom of the mine.  Surface Facilities  thumbleftupright=1.5alt=Layout of the buildings of the Notre-Dame Mine Pit : When Ronchamp acquired the Notre-Dame pit, the extant buildings, poorly designed in the first place, were in poor condition. The steam engine which powered the extracting machine was composed of gears and two cylinders of different diameters, one of 60 cm, the other 70 cm, which caused instability and necessitated frequent repair. The wooden headframe was dilapidated, and the framework of the shaft was falling to pieces . As for ventilation, its flat-bladed ventilator did not surpass a flow rate of 7m3/s, insufficient for a deep mine shaft . In 1867, the facilities were completely renovated. A new 100 horse-power direct-traction extraction machine and two cylinders with a diameter of 70 cm and a run of two meters, accompanied by six steam generators 8 meters long, were ordered by A. K≈ìchlin and Company to be installed in a building placed at a right angle to the other and topped by a tall chimney . The pit was also outfitted with a new, more powerful ventilator, an air compressor, the only source of mechanical energy at the bottom of the mine, a lamp shop, and a \\"swimming pool\\" for the miners.Soci√©t√© de l'industrie min√©rale, Bulletin trimestriel, Saint-√âtienne, 1882 Additionally, a hundred mine carts capable of carrying 400 kg each were purchased to replace the old 300 kg-capacity carts, which were transferred to the Saint-Charles mine where they replaced the old, wooden wagons of the more primitive extraction elevator.http://www.abamm.org/ficpdf/mehu.pdf In total, the Coal Mines of Ronchamp invested 164,000 Francs to ready the Notre-Dame mine for extraction.  Exploitation  alt=Layout of the bottom of the Notre-Dame mine in 1881 By 1864, the Notre-Dame mine was working at full capacity, with 400 workers, of whom 90 were hewers producing up to 100 tons per day . It being the sole active mine from the annexed √âboulet territory, it was made to function as two extraction mines, with two dedicated, independent compartments possessing separate extraction machines. An Anglo-Saxon Master Miner headed this project, but the mine suffered from faulty lining and poor reinforcement, necessitating numerous repairs and the abandonment of double-extraction. Railroads serving the mine of Notre-Dame. In 1865, the year before the Coal Mines of √âboulet merged into Ronchamp, the mine was linked to the coal mine railroad system by a railroad that transported the coal via the Eastern Paris to Mulhouse-Ville line. On the 16th of September 1867, all work was stopped in order to completely transform the mine facilities following a cable rupture. The 0.57 meter railroads were replaced by wider ones measuring 0.65 meters. Old wagons were transferred to the Saint-Charles mine. On the following 10 November, extraction recommenced with the new machine, new cages, new equipment, and 100 new 450 kg-capacity wagons. In 1867, the mine was deepened to 564 meters, and a gallery was excavated which was to link it to the Saint-Joseph mine. In 1868, production dropped dramatically from 52,000 tons in 1867 to 28,000 tons the following year. Several factors led to this significant drop in production, one of the most significant being flooding resulting from the drilling of the new gallery leading towards the Saint-Joseph pit. Work had to be stopped for two months, which resulted in difficulties in recommencing exploitation. In 1869, the exploitation of the gallery at 520m began, where a vein existed that was two meters thick. But this coal bed was interrupted by two fissures to the North and West, and by a raise to the east. New explorations were therefore undertaken to the south where the coal beds descended. The Pneumatic Boring Machine In 1871, a compressed air machine was used for the drilling of the southern passage at the bottom of the Notre-Dame pit, the first of its kind in France. The passage was finished on the 13th of May 1872, and coal was found . In the 1870s, the amount of water in the Notre- Dame mine shaft increased considerably, passing from 66 m3 per day in 1874 to 1,100 m3 in 1879. More water was being removed from the shaft than coal. In 1875, director-engineer Mathet, leaving the Ronchamp mining district for the coal mines of Blanzy, expressed doubt concerning the future productivity of the pit. He believed that the reserves of usable coal were limited, but that there was potential value in Southeastern explorations, in the direction of the mine shaft of l'Esp√©rance. According to him, to deepen the shaft another fifty meters and dig another gallery in that direction could prolong the life of the mine by another ten years . The 1st of September 1880, a 10-meter chunk of the mine wall detached, crumbled, and crushed the receiving level, trapping two miners below. These miners were trapped in the mine for a week, but emerged alive. From 1880 to 1881, the facilities of the Notre-Dame Mine were completely reworked. The pit was restored and a locker room and a wooden building between the machine room and the receiving room were constructed. In 1892, a significant bed was discovered behind a rising stratum of rock, but two years later, a number of flaws appeared. The mine of Notre-Dame would soon be closed, its resources being effectively depleted. In 1896, the mine was abandoned but not yet plugged.  Water pump  The headframe around 1900 The Notre-Dame Pit between the wars By 1903, coal mining had ceased at the Notre- Dame pit, but it had been unfilled and a few workers were still present. The pit was preserved for use as a water pump for the coal mines of Ronchamp. All of the excavations, whether active or not, were connected to one another, and water flowed towards the new southern passageways . In 1922, the company decided to revisit an abandoned mass of coal with a width of 150 meters that had been left intact to serve as flood prevention for the more recent excavations. The decision was made to mine this coal. Draining commenced on the 13th of October 1925 and was completed in 1927 . Before beginning excavations, however, a link to the Chanois mine had to be established. This new linkage, finished in 1930, became the 1,500-meter-long Cameroun gallery. The extracted coal was sent to the Chanois Mine, where adequate infrastructure existed, and the Notre-Dame mine served two purposes: pumping 7,000 tons of water per month and serving as the downcast shaft by which air entered the underground, the Sainte-Marie shaft, with its powerful ventilators, serving as the upcast shaft. In 1944, the battles for liberation brought about the stoppage of the pumps of the √âboulet shaft and the build-up of water in the galleries. In 1945, water pumping began again at the rate of 6,400 m¬≥ per month, and coal extraction resumed. Upon the nationalization of French coal mines in 1946, under the provisional post-war government, initially led by Charles de Gaulle, Ronchamp Mining District was placed under the authority of √âlectricit√© de France (EDF), because it was too distant from the other large mining districts of France, and it included a major thermal power plant. After 1950, the Notre-Dame mine shaft, which could still contain large masses of coal, was again discussed along with a neighboring site, the Tonnet mine shaft, whose coal reserves had already been judged to be exploitable. But the old constructions had to be cleaned up and drained of water, and new infrastructure had to be constructed. The cost of this project (undertaken by the mine's supporting committee) was estimated at a billion francs. But EDF did not wish to invest further in Ronchamp coal mines, and was preparing to abandon the mining district. The Notre-Dame shaft closed permanently in 1958 and was filled in with schist from June 16 to July 17, 1958. The Saint-Georges and Tonnet shafts were filled in at the same time,.  Conversion  On September 28, 1981, at the instigation of the municipality of Ronchamp, a monument created by Bernard Poivey was erected and inaugurated on the foundation of the extraction shaft 29\\\\. The site was decorated with potted flowers, gravel, and a grass lawn of grass, and is maintained annually by the commune of Champagney.Martine Pelletier, \\"R√©alisation de Bernard Poivey\\", Le Pays, 2006 In March 2006, Bernard Poivey removed his monument, which had deteriorated, and decided to make changes to it.

Worker housing and community  The Notre-Dame mine shaft is situated in the hamlet of √âboulet, fairly distant from the center of Ronchamp, where there were only a dozen houses in the mid-19th century. A building which had housed machinery was fitted out into a dormitory for mine workers. In 1930, a large building, dubbed the \\"Ch√¢teau of √âboulet\\", was constructed. It consisted of two stories containing a total of eight dwellings. Three miner towns were built in proximity to the Notre-Dame mine shaft. The town of Morbier, constructed in 1927 by the Mine Company of Ostricourt (Compagnie des mines d'Ostricourt) in order to house the mostly Polish workforce, was composed of 24 duplexes. Ten of these were single-story dwellings, and the rest had two. They were built in the same fashion as the houses in the √âboulet town. The ironwork on the fa√ßades of the houses represented an interlaced M and O, the logo of the Mines of Ostricourt Company.Cit√© ouvri√®re du Morbier (Workers' Town of Morbier), Database of French Heritage, French Ministry of CultureJean-Jacques Parietti, Les Houill√®res de Ronchamp vol.

Prior to working in the South Carolina legislature, Caskey worked as the Assistant Solicitor for the 11th Circuit (2014‚Äì2016), and also served in the United States Marine Corps (2003‚Äì2013), where he would achieve the rank of Captain. Early life and education Caskey was born in Columbia, South Carolina, to parents Micajah III, and Rebecca Anne Caskey. He grew up in the Springdale, South Carolina, and graduated from Dutch Fork High School in 1999. While in high school, he earned Eagle Scout honors and was also a state champion wrestler. He attended the University of Florida on a full scholarship and graduated in 2003. Later, he attended law school at the University of South Carolina, where he also earned a master's degree in International Business.

Pittsinger (March 18, 1837 - February 22, 1908), known as \\"The California Poetess\\", was an American poet. She was born in Massachusetts and came to California from her home in Chesterfield in 1852, making the voyage around the horn. At the outbreak of the American Civil War, she devoted her whole energies for a time toward molding the public sentiment for The Union. After a visit home to Massachusetts, she was married, but her life proving unhappy, she was soon divorced. When she again returned to California, she began writing for different papers, taking a deep interest in spiritualistic investigations and phenomena. She was a regular contributor to the Golden Era, the Carrier Dove, and the Banner of Light. What she considered her greatest poem, \\"Song of the Soul Victorious\\", was a treatment of the eternity of life, one of her favorite themes. Although Pittsinger wrote some very popular verses, she became obscure later in life. Early years Eliza Ann Pittsinger was born in Westhampton, Massachusetts, March 18, 1837. Her father was of German descent. Her mother was of Anglo-Saxon birth and blended unusual personal attractions with a nature bold and aspiring. The mother's death occurred at the age of 32, leaving Pittsinger with two brothers and two sisters to the care and guidance of an older sister, a girl of 14, who thus acted in the double capacity of mother and sister. The father, deeply suffering from his bereavement, became negligent of his business matters, so that his circumstances and means of supporting his family were greatly reduced. Pittsinger early exhibited a disposition impulsive, daring, precocious; she cherished an unusual desire for knowledge of all kinds, and availed herself of all educational opportunities. At the age of 14, she took charge of the house for her father, two brothers, and a sister, and walked to teach a school; and at the same time instructed at home a younger brother and sister. At 16, she was teacher of a school in western New York, composed mostly of boys much older than herself. During the three following years, her time was spent in teaching through the summer, and attending the Northampton High School in winter, from which she graduated with what is generally considered a thorough New England education. Career Subsequent to completing her education, Pittsinger was engaged for several years at Rogers' stereotype institution in Boston as proof-reader and reviewer. In the spring of 1854, she sailed for California; and four years later, her stirring songs and lyrics began to appear in the California journals. Here, she developed many admirers and warm friends by her fervent patriotism and devoted enthusiasm to the zealous efforts in the cause of social and moral reforms. In the mining districts, she was enthusiastically received and appreciated. In 1866 and 1867, at Nevada City, Grass Valley, and at the lakes and among the Sierra Nevadas, at San Francisco and elsewhere, she read her own poems to enthusiastic audiences, and at the same time wrote letters of travel for San Francisco papers. A farewell benefit was tendered her by the influential people of that city on the eve of her departure for a visit north. She wrote an extended ‚ÄúPoem on California,‚Äù to be compiled with others. Bugle Peals In the early 1860s-1870s, Pittsinger was well known within the poetic world. Then, her poems regarding the eternity of life, the sublimity of love, and the glory of patriotism thrilled readers. With patriotic fervor she wrote war songs, the inspiring words of which stirred California youth for the cause of The Union in the days of the American Civil War. She was called \\"The California Poetess\\". Her poems were recited in the schools and taught by teachers of elocution. No public meeting was complete in those days without a rendition of one of her thrilling \\"Bugle Peals\\", or her \\"Song of the Soul Victorious,\\" a lyric on the immortality of life which she considered her masterpiece. Throughout California, she was known and revered. But in later days, the lyrics grew less inspiring, though her enthusiasm never wavered. Slowly among the rising generations of young people, her popularity waned and faded away. At the time of her death, her name was practically unknown. She wrote wholly from aspiration. Freedom and justice to all was her motto. She accepted the theory of reincarnation, embodiments in the material form, and the varied experiences thereby obtained, to prepare it for its immortal destiny. That idea was embodied in a number of her most remarkable poems. She was chosen the poet for the 40th anniversary celebration of the raising of the first American flag in California. She wrote a stirring poem for the 400th anniversary of the birth of Martin Luther, which was recited by herself and others on that occasion. Her poems were varied and numerous. Personal life Eliza A. Pittsinger With the exception of eight years spent in the north Atlantic States, she lived in San Francisco since the days of the war. She lived with her only sister, Almira Ingram Holcomb, who was an invalid. After Almira died in May 1907, Pittsinger lived practically alone. As late as 1906, she wrote a short poem on the earthquake, and it was one of her hopes for some time to have all her works gathered and published. She had been ill for only four days before her death, to the last, protesting that she was going to recover. She died in San Francisco on February 22, 1908.

Kurdish: Fata Re≈ü) was a female chieftain of a Kurdish tribe from Marash (present Kahramanmara≈ü in southeastern Turkey). Her lifetime spanned the 19th century, though her exact dates are not easy to reference. She personally commanded a Kurdish contingent in the Crimean War to prove her loyalty to the Ottoman state following the imprisonment of her husband, the tribal leader. According to the local historian Cezmi Yurtsever from the Kahramanmara≈ü-Adana area, Kara Fatma (1820-1865) was the nickname of Asiye Hanƒ±m from Andƒ±rƒ±n who fought during the Crimean War.H√ºrriyet newspaper 16.02.2007 She featured prominently in The Illustrated London News of 22 April 1854, which devotes a long article and a full-page illustration to her arrival, with a large retinue of mounted warriors of her tribe, in Constantinople. The Illustrated London News described her as: > The Queen, or Prophetess -- for she is endowed with supernatural attributes > -- is a little dark old woman of about sixty, with nothing of the amazon in > her appearance, although she wears what seems to be intended for male > attire, and bestrides her steed like the warriors of her train. She is > attended by two handmaids, like herself in masculine costume, and was > brought across the Bosphorus, with a select band of followers, to a species > of barrack in Stamboul. Fatima Khanum arrived in Constantinople at the beginning of the Crimean war with a retinue of 300 horsemen \\"to request an audience with the padishah to show support and offer assistance.\\" One German observer described her as having a \\"manly look\\". Fatima Khanum's exact dates appear uncertain, however, and scholar Michael Gunter has suggested that she fought in the Russo-Turkish war of 1877. In 1887 the Chicago Tribune described Kara Fatima as 'The Redoubtable female warrior of Kurdistan'.

[archive] From 1967 to 1969, as a Junior Fellow of the Harvard Society of Fellows at Harvard University, he carried out a postdoctoral internship in James Watson's laboratory at that university. He spent the last three months of 1969 at the Salk Institute, where he collaborated with Suzanne Bourgeois in the laboratory of Melvin Cohn.  Scientific and administrative career  After his doctorate, Maxime Schwartz returned to the Pasteur Institute, where he remained for most of his career. He first worked there as a researcher at the CNRS, and then, from 1973, as a CNRS/Institut Pasteur dual member. At the CNRS, he was a research professor from 1971 to 1986 and research director from 1986 to 2007. At the Pasteur Institute, he was head of laboratory from 1973 to 1984 and then professor from 1984 to 2007. From 1975 to 1995, he was head of the Molecular Genetics Unit at the Pasteur Institute. From 1985 to 1987, he was Deputy Director (Scientific Director) of the Pasteur Institute. From 1988 to 1999, he was Director General of the Pasteur Institute. From 2000 to 2001, he was Head of the Cell Physiology Unit at the Pasteur Institute. Since 2007, the year of his retirement, he has been a charg√© de mission with the management of the Institut Pasteur. From 2002 to 2006, he was Scientific Director of the French Food Safety Agency, headed by Martin Hirsch, then Pascale Briand. On March 30, 1987, Maxime Schwartz was elected correspondant of the French Academy of sciences, in the Molecular and Cellular Biology and Genomics section.  Distinctions  S.A. Waksman Gold Medal of the French Academy of sciences (1974). Richard Lounsbery Prize of the French Academy of sciences and the National Academy of Sciences (1984).

These have enabled him to address very general questions, such as the regulation of protein synthesis and the structure, functions and biogenesis of membrane proteins.1.M. Schwartz, ‚ÄúThe maltose regulon‚Äù, in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium : Cellular and molecular biology. Vol I. . Ed. Neidhardt F.C., American Society for Microbiology (1987) Fran√ßois Jacob and Jacques Monod's work on the metabolism of another sugar, lactose, in the same bacterium led them to propose that the expression of genes encoding the enzymes necessary for the metabolism of this sugar is blocked by a repressor, a regulatory protein whose action is itself inhibited in the presence of lactose. The unblocking of the genes thus results from the inhibition of the repressor1.F. Jacob , J. Monod, ‚ÄúGenetic regulatory mechanisms in the synthesis of proteins‚Äù, J. Mol. Biol. 3 , (1961) 1.J. Monod, ‚ÄúFrom enzymatic adaptation to allosteric transitions‚Äù, Nobel lecture, 11 d√©cembre 1965.. This regulation involving a double inhibition was later to be qualified as negative. Based on his work on maltose metabolism, Maxime Schwartz was one of the first to suggest the existence of positive regulation, the expression of genes resulting from the activation of an activator1\\\\. O. Raibaud, M. Schwartz, ‚ÄúPositive control of transcription initiation in bacteria‚Äù, Annual Review of Genetics, 18 pp 173-206 (1984). Positive regulation mechanisms subsequently proved to be extremely frequent in all living cells. The most original aspect of Maxime Schwartz's work on membrane proteins is the demonstration that one of the proteins allowing the transport of maltose through the bacterial envelope serves as a receptor for a bacterial virus, the bacteriophage lambda.1.L. Randall-Hazelbauer, M. Schwartz, ‚ÄúIsolation of the bacteriophage Lambda receptor from Escherichia coli‚Äù, J. Bacteriol., 116, (1973) It was a novel notion that virus receptors are proteins with a well-defined function for the target cell. This is now a well- established fact for many, many viruses. Maxime Schwartz has also been interested, in collaboration with the laboratory of the American Jonathan Beckwith, in the mechanisms that allow proteins to be placed in various layers of the bacterial envelope. Using genetic methods, he is helping to demonstrate that the signal sequence, located at the amino-terminal end of membrane- through proteins and defined by Gunther Blobel's group, is indeed necessary for the transport of these proteins across the cytoplasm membrane, but is not sufficient.1\\\\. S.D. Emr, M. Schwartz, T.J. Sihavy, ‚ÄúMutations altering the cellular localization of the receptor, an Escherichia coli outer membrane protein‚Äù, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 75, (1978)1\\\\. F. Moreno, A.V. Fowler, M. Hall, T.J. Silhavy, I. Zabin, M. Schwartz, ‚ÄúA signal sequence is not sufficient to lead √ü-galactosidase out of the cytoplasm‚Äù, Nature, 286, (1980) Indeed the inactivation by mutation of the signal sequence prevents such a protein from crossing the membrane; on the other hand the single addition of a signal sequence to the end of a cytoplasmic protein is not sufficient to make it cross the membrane.  Management of the Pasteur Institute  Managing Director of the Institut Pasteur for two consecutive six-year terms, Maxime Schwartz is striving to continue the work of modernization begun by his predecessors, Jacques Monod, Fran√ßois Gros and Raymond Dedonder. On the Paris campus, he presided over the construction of several new buildings, including the Scientific Information Centre, financed by the bequest from the Duchess of Windsor, and undertook the renovation of most of the laboratories located in older buildings. He also continued the development of the International Network of Pasteur Institutes (which he named), upgrading the equipment of the old institutes, integrating foreign institutes such as those in St. Petersburg and Romania, building a new institute in Cambodia, and initiating the creation of a joint laboratory between the Pasteur Institute and the University of Hong Kong. At the scientific level, it promotes the application of molecular biology techniques to the study of infectious diseases, thus allowing the emergence of several teams of great international reputation. In addition, he works to develop and modernize relations between research and industry, presiding in particular over the creation of the first \\"start-ups\\" created by researchers from the institute. In 1994, Maxime Schwartz succeeded in getting the American government to admit that the virus isolated by the American Robert Gallo as being the AIDS virus was none other than the virus that the Pasteurian Luc Montagnier had sent him a year earlier; he thus put an end to a 10-year-old controversy involving scientific ethics as well as financial aspects.1\\\\.

Jacob, 2009, Paris  AFSSA Scientific Directorate  With the title of Director of Laboratory Programming, Maxime Schwartz worked for 5 years as Scientific Director of the laboratories of the French Food Safety Agency (AFSSA). As such, he notably launched a European Network of Excellence, MED-VET-NET, bringing together veterinary and human medicine laboratories for the study of diseases transmitted to humans by animals. In this agency, he also chairs the \\"Biotechnology\\" expert committee whose main objective is to give opinions to public authorities on the marketing of genetically modified organisms.

Let's Be Heroes features a fictional cast created by Ian Jones-Quartey. Main K.O. :Voiced by ::Stephanie Nadolny (formerly) ::Courtenay Taylor (currently) :Hero Level :: 4 (Season 3) :: 100 (Epilogue) K.O. is the protagonist of the show. He is the son of Carol, and the newest employee at \\"Gar's Bodega\\", located in Lakewood Plaza. His birthday is June 18, which is also the PIN for his mom's credit card. K.O. is optimistic, loyal and willing to help anyone. While he can be simple-minded and gullible, he can easily be relied on by his friends, whom he cares for deeply. He is also easily amazed by anything hero or weapon related and is always looking for advice on how to be a proper hero, usually from his mother. In \\"Know Your Mom,\\" K.O. believed that his mother quit being a hero when he was born, but learns that this was not the case. In that same episode, it's shown that he didn't know her name until then. K.O. has low intelligence as for a long time he was unaware that Mr. Logic was a robot, or that his mom cooked his food (he thought it came from the \\"Dinner Man\\"). He does at times showcase deductive reasoning and has been shown to be manipulative, particularly towards Darrell and Shannon. After being trapped by T.K.O in their subconscious in \\"Carl\\", K.O. manages to finally integrate his alter ego in the series finale and becomes the new owner of \\"Gar's Bodega\\" in the epilogue. Enid :Voiced by Mena Suvari (Pilot), Ashly Burch (Current) :Hero Level: 5 (Currently) Enid is a teenage witch who works as a cashier at the bodega, claiming herself as a ninja and that her werewolf father and vampire mother are a supermodel and spy. Enid is the most practical and down to earth of the employees, but seems to lack motivation in her job despite being shown to handle out-of-control situations, like in the events of \\"We've Got Pests\\" where she convinced a group of partiers to grow up and discover themselves. In her preteen years, having attended \\"Ghoul School\\" prior, Enid was revealed to be shy and insecure as she was embarrassed of her family and wanted to be identified as a ninja though she forgets a majority of spells as consequence. But after the events of \\"Parents Day\\", Enid learns to accept her family's quirks as her parents warm up to her career choice, later reconnecting with her old \\"Ghoul School\\" friends. She and Red Action eventually start dating, the two running a dojo together in the series epilogue episode. Radicles :Voiced by Ian Jones-Quartey :Hero Level: 3 (Currently) Radicles, most often known as Rad, is an alien teenager from Planet X, who also works as a shelf stocker at the bodega. Rad slacks off the most out of the trio despite claiming to be all powerful and showing off. He boasts a tough masculine exterior, but is actually rather mild compared to other heroes and, as shown in \\"You Are Rad,\\" possesses a softer side that he refuses to acknowledge for fear of being embarrassed. In fact, Rad is more prone to crying than the others and is therefore much more sensitive to having his feelings hurt. Mr. Gar :Voiced by David Herman :Hero Level: 11 Eugene Garcia is the overseer of the plaza and owner of the bodega where K.O., Enid, and Rad work. He is tough, serious and prideful of the plaza and wishes that no harm will come of it. However, he has on occasion shown to not mind his employees slacking as he considers it \\"normal\\". He finds it uncomfortable to be emotional around others, mainly Carol, whom he had feelings for though did not act on out of guilt. In his younger days, Mr. Gar was originally a P.O.I.N.T. member codenamed El-Bow who fell in love with his fellow recruit Carol, who was in love with their senior Laser Blast. But he was fired from P.O.I.N.T. after he inadvertently distracted Carol from a stakeout that got Laser Blast killed. After a time of wandering, Mr. Gar was entrusted with the land he built the plaza on by the President of the Universe, who enlists him for several secret missions. In \\"T.K.O.,\\" Mr. Gar manages to open up of how proud he is of K.O. while openly admitting his feelings for Carol. After a three-month time skip at the start of the second season, it is revealed that Mr. Gar and Carol have begun dating and that Mr. Gar has taken a father like role to K.O. Carol :Voiced by Kate Flannery :Hero Level: 11 Carol is K.O.'s tough yet doting mother and the owner of \\"Fitness Emotions\\" at the plaza, usually visited by Ginger, Gladys and Gertie. She usually gives her son helpful advice only a mother could give, though it's not always clear what it is she is trying to teach. She is good friends with Mr. Gar, but is slightly oblivious to his feelings for her. However, in \\"T.K.O.\\", she seems to acknowledge Mr. Gar's feelings for her, but doesn't seem to care, or at least seems to have known all along. In that same episode, it is revealed that Carol trained K.O. himself since his infancy. In her younger days, Carol was originally a P.O.I.N.T. member code-named Silver Spark who had feelings for the group's senior member Laser Blast with his apparent death leading her to initially bear a grudge on Mr. Gar for keeping her from preventing it, but forgave him as he technically saved her life and knew of his crush for her. After a three-month time skip following the first-season finale, having started dating Mr. Gar, Carol is revealed to still be a P.O.I.N.T. agent in secret as she is safeguarding the Glorb tree under the plaza to prevent a direct intervention by P.O.I.N.T.

In \\"I Am Dendy\\" she approached K.O. on the pretext of needing help fixing her backpack so she could study him, but bonded with him over their shared interests and now considers him a friend. Though Dendy is aware of K.O.'s lack of tech expertise, this does not appear to phase her even when he accidentally released a virus on the plaza. She ultimately values her time with K.O. and considers him a close friend. In \\"You're in Control\\" Dendy tells K.O. that she loves him and that he is appreciated, even admitting that he has helped her in the \\"emotional sciences\\". =Mr. Logic= :Voiced by James Urbaniak :Hero Level: 2 Mr. Logic is a robotic hairstylist who owns the \\"Logic Cuts\\" barber shop at the plaza, able to scan and add up everyone's hero levels. In the episode \\"Lad & Logic\\", Mr. Logic was revealed to originally created by Lord Boxman, and helped set up Boxmore. But Boxman's insistence to destroy the then unfinished plaza rather than robots for other villains to earn profit, convinced Mr. Logic to leave him after meeting Mr. Gar and being Lakewood Plaza Turbo's first worker. =Drupe= :Voiced by Melissa Villase√±or :Hero Level: 1 Drupe is a humanoid strawberry teenager who hangs out with Red Action and Gregg as one of the Cool Teens, usually making fun of others to hide her own negative traits as she is shy about her fashion blog. In the aftermath of \\"You're Everybody's Sidekick\\" when K.O. got her blog exposure, Drupe gradually loosened up and has become friendlier to K.O. and his friends. In \\"RMS & Brandon's First Episode\\", revealed to be friends with A Real Magic Skeleton and Brandon, Drupe takes a job as a coffee barista in the plaza after RMS indirectly convinced her that she should do something with her life. She developed her own business following the events of \\"Project Ray Way\\". P.O.I.N.T.

During Mr. Gar's time as P.O.I.N.T. member, initially appearing in flashback sequences. But after Laser Blast's apparent death, Foxtail ran P.O.I.N.T. like a military force as she believed power is the only way to protect everyone. Making her first physical appearance in \\"Point to the Plaza\\", Foxtail expresses disdain towards Mr. Gar and looked down on his current place in life at the Plaza. She is the head of P.O.I.N.T. Prep's Strength House where she shows a social Darwinist outlook in her expectations that all superheroes are not created equal and only a few are worthy, wanting custody of the glorb tree under Lakewood Plaza Turbo to supply her forces with power ups. In the second-season finale, Foxtail takes over the plaza for a duration of two months before accepting defeat and naming Elodie her successor while retiring. =Doctor Greyman= :Voiced by Dana Snyder Doctor Greyman is a grey alien wearing a fedora and purple scarf, being the team's scientist. He originally possessed telekinesis, but lost it to a power-draining weapon. Years later, despite being looked down for being powerless, Greyman is the head of P.O.I.N.T. Prep's Wisdom House where he is shown to be wheelchair bound and wearing a fake beard while speaking in a German accent. Greyman is later revealed to be Chip's creator, fired by Foxtail from P.O.I.N.T. Prep when he used she manipulated and refused to help her in her plans. He later returns in \\"Chip's Damage\\", convincing K.O. and Elodie to let Chip be retired. =Rippy Roo= :Voiced by Ashly Burch Rippy Roo is a small blue kangaroo with boxing gloves that joined P.O.I.N.T. along with Carol and Mr. Gar, supposedly accepted into the team because of her adorable nature making her something of a mascot. She only speaks in a burbled animal language that P.O.I.N.T. members somehow understand. Rippy's pouch is a literal wormhole that allows her to carry an insurmountable amount of objects. Following Laser Blast's funeral, Rippy left PO.I.N.T. on her devices upon realizing the path its remaining members were taking. Rippy returns in \\"Whatever Happened to... Rippy Roo?\\", revealed to have become a physic scientist and having secretly attempted to retrieve Laser Blast as she reconnects with Carol. =Chip Damage= :Voiced by Kurt Angle :Hero Level: 10, 15 (In \\"Mystery Science Fair 201X\\") Chip Damage is a celebrity superhero that is looked up to by many other heroes, later revealed to an android created by Doctor Greyman for that exact purpose following the apparent death of Laser Blast. Chip makes his first actual appearance in \\"Point to the Plaza\\" where it is shown that he cares more for his fans than he does actually helping anyone. Despite his \\"best\\" efforts, Enid and K.O. end up saving the Plaza resulting in Chip suggesting the former join P.O.I.N.T. Prep Academy. Despite this, Chip is still technically a responsive hero who gives support to young up and comers. But Foxtail uses a remote control made to modify Chip's programming to have him secretly power up their students by secretly imbuing them with glorbs that he remotely activates at will, with Elodie and Sparko being among the students of his special class, before Chip was deactivated. Elodie attempts to bring back Chip in \\"Chip's Damage\\" before Dr. Greyman convinces her to retire the android so the next generation of heroes can take over. =Professor Sunshine= :Voiced by Melanie Chartoff Professor Sunshine is a living cloud person who is the head of P.O.I.N.T. Prep's Charisma House. Unlike her fellow P.O.I.N.T. members, Sunshine is optimistic and very supportive whenever she displays her sunlight abilities. However, she can change herself to being a cold front cloud which she uses to search the hallways for any after hours students. At this point, she has an unforgiving demeanor. =Elodie= :Voiced by Reshma Shetty :Hero Level: 4 Elodie is a popular superhero who attends P.O.I.N.T. Prep Academy, initially Enid's childhood friend before betraying her during school entrances. When Elodie returns to Lakewood Plaza Turbo, she loses to Enid in an exhibition rematch. Despite Elodie's indifferent and uncaring nature towards Enid, she still considers her a friend despite hiding it and her drive to be the best. Elodie eventually makes peace with Enid during the latter's time in P.O.I.N.T. Prep when she places Enid's life above winning their match. This ultimately resulted in Elodie helping Enid expose Chip Damage, having been a participant in being infused with glorbs on a regular basis. While Enid chooses to leave P.O.I.N.T. Prep, Elodie decides to stay as she feels she had worked hard to get where she is and wants to make the school a better place. Elodie later returns in the second-season finale \\"Dark Plaza\\" as Foxtail's right hand before being promoted as the new leader of P.O.I.N.T..

Captain Planet is once again called upon by the Planeteers, which consists of Kwame and the Lakewood Plaza Heroes, to battle Dr. Blight and Lord Boxman. He and Kwame attempted to stop climate change many years ago, but were unable to, resulting in all the Planeteers except Kwame to quit. However, thanks to K.O., Enid and Rad, the gang create a PSA to remind people to preserve the planet, with the original Planeteers appearing in non-speaking cameos. Kwame :Voiced by LeVar Burton :Origin: Captain Planet and the Planeteers Kwame is one of the five Planeteers who summons Captain Planet. He hails from Ghana and possesses the Earth ring.

An enchanted tree caused by Enid's inexperience over the years eats Winnie and Tanis and proceeds to dance off with them. When Enid finally confesses that she no longer considers herself a monster like them, they admit that they knew all along that she was into ninjas. They nevertheless resolve her issue by rescuing Winnie and Tanis from the enchanted tree. Afterwards, the gang all dance together knowing that they are still friends. Garnet :Voiced by Estelle :Origin: Steven Universe :Hero Level: Two gems Garnet is the leader of the Crystal Gems, who was inexplicably taken from her world and ended up in Cartoon Network City. She teams up with K.O., Ben, and Raven to stop the villainous Strike and rescue the inhabitants of the multiverse.

Strike ends up removing Ben's Omnitrix while he is still in his Four Arms mode, leaving him stuck in that form until he can get his Omnitrix back. Being rather young, he admires his own abilities above the rest of the team, but nevertheless forms a special bond with them. Eventually, K.O. retrieves Strike's pen and returns Ben's Omnitrix and the other team's abilities. Ben's Omnitrix, however, now allows him to transform into any Cartoon Network character, which he uses to defeat Strike and save the Cartoon Network universe.

Though Boxman was fired in the first-season finale as his obsession with the plaza lead to a falling out with his investors, he regains control of Boxmore after Professor Venomous bought full ownership and rebranded the company as Voxmore. But Boxman leaves his company for good after deeming Shadowy Venomous too evil by his own standards, leaving his remaining robots at Lakewood Plaza. Boxman returns in the series finale, getting back with Venomous in the epilogue. =Darrell= :Voiced by Ian Jones-Quartey :Hero Level: -4 Darrell is the robot teenager \\"son\\" of Lord Boxman who wields a blaster on his arm, mass-produced so he can transfer his consciousness into a replacement body whenever a current one is destroyed with variations that include Mega Darrel. But the Darrell models as a whole act on a hive mind, which can be a bit detrimental if multiple Darrell models are activated all at once for menial purposes and cause the primary Darrel to become distracted. Besides an unusual obsession with playing dress up for no reason, Darrell also considered himself Boxman's favorite until his creator build Boxman Jr. He staged a coup and is promoted by the investors to the new owner of Boxmore as Lord Cowboy Darrell.

Jethro is a slow moving robot who can only say \\"I am Jethro!\\", or \\"I am Mega Jethro!\\" in case of the Mega Jethro model, which irritates Rad and Enid while hinting Jethro's non-conscious and simple nature. The model as a whole function as cannon fodder whose only object to moving function, Jethro having been known to read about existentialism in their spare time. During \\"Jethro's All Yours\\", K.O. attempted to reason to Jethro before accepting the robot is beyond any form of reasoning. But in the episode \\"I Am Jethro\\", one Jethro became sentient from being overloaded from Glorbs during production and is currently hiding among his Jethro brothers with the intent of staging a revolt in Boxmore.

He developed a close relationship with Carol before he was apparently killed in action during a stakeout where he charged into a villain's lair and was seemingly sucked into a black hole, but he actually survived and lost his superpowers. Attempts at experimenting on himself to restore his lost powers resulted in his current purple, snake-like form, and an alternate personality known as Shadowy Figure. Venomous eventually resurfaced as a respected scientist in the villain community and one of Lord Boxman's clients. At some point, he gained a young humanoid rat \\"minion\\" named Fink who he treats like a daughter. During the first season, while Shadowy Figure used his time in control of the body to orchestrate the manifestation of T.K.O., Venomous expressed his admiration for Boxman by providing him a bio-chip that would be used in Boxman Jr.'s creation. Regaining his passion for evil while taking in Boxman in \\"Boxman Crashes\\", Venomous uses the money he extorted from Congresswoman to buy Boxmore from its investors and reinstate Boxman as its head, with himself as Boxman's business partner. He also became Boxman's lover and began being referred to as the stepfather of Boxman's robotic children. Venomous' true identity as Laserblast (and thus K.O.'s biological father, though he was not aware of this until recently) is revealed in \\"Big Reveal\\", and he learns of Shadowy Figure's existence in \\"Let's Get Shadowy\\". Though Venomous promises K.O. he'll get rid of his alter ego, he is instead completely taken over by Shadowy Figure, with their Shadowy Venomous form talking T.K.O. into an alliance.

Fink uses Glorbs to temporarily power herself up into Turbo Fink. Fink is also revealed to knew about Venomous' activities as Shadowy Figure, expressing her disdain for the alternate personality. In the finale, helping the heroes fight T.K.O., Fink is teleported alongside Venomous by the President of the Universe to another planet that they attack to their hearts' desire. Returning to Earth in the epilogue episode, Fink grows up to become an Esports competitor.

But T.K.O. gradually transitions into an anti-villain after he and K.O come to an understanding in the first-season finale, K.O. providing T.K.O. a means to exert his frustrations to freely use his powers without losing control. This means however, that the two are permanently \\"chained\\" together. In \\"T.K.O.'s House\\", T.K.O. is revealed to have an existential crisis stemming from his obsession with Shadowy Figure's interest in him and K.O.. While not getting all the answers he wanted when he and K.O. develop their Perfect K.O. form, T.K.O. got some closure from the attempted interrogation. But T.K.O. ends up being exiled to K.O.'s subconscious for the trouble he caused during the events of \\"T.K.O. Rules\\". T.K.O. later resurfaces in \\"Carl\\" and takes over K.O.'s body to confront Venomous about Shadowy Figure, only to be talked into an alliance with Shadowy Venomous.

The guns were used by the French Army during the First World War and Second World War. History The origins of the mod√®le 1913‚Äì1917 go back to the Canon de 75 mod√®le 1897 field gun which was first employed on improvised anti-aircraft mounts, which were typically earthen embankments or scaffolds to get the muzzle pointed skyward. Later in the war, specialized anti-aircraft mounts were developed. These included: * Canon de 75 mm antia√©rien mle 1913 - a self- propelled version, on the back of a De Dion-Bouton truck chassis. The gun could be brought into action in five minutes, but its traverse and elevation were slow which combined with a lack of fire direction equipment limited its effectiveness. Puteaux completed 20 self-propelled versions in 1913 and by the end of WWI 196 had been completed. * Canon de 75 mm antia√©rien mle 1915 - a pit mounted high-angle steel girder framework which took approximately 24 hours to prepare for firing. There was also a version with a rotating platform mounted on a concrete pedestal. The platform allowed 0¬∞ to 75¬∞ of elevation and 360¬∞ traverse. During the 1930s improvements in aircraft speed and ceiling combined with slow traverse and elevation of the mount rendered them obsolete. In April 1940 approximately 20 mle 1915 were left in service. * Canon de 75 mm antia√©rien mle 1917 - a single-axle towed version with three outriggers. This had all fire-control equipment mounted on the carriage and was a Schneider design. *7.7 cm FlaK L/35 - a Krupp conversion of captured M1897 field guns to fire German 7.7 cm ammunition. The guns were placed on a modified de Bange 120 or 155 carriage to allow up to 60¬∞ of elevation and the guns were mounted on an elevated ring to allow 360¬∞ of traverse. By Spring of 1916 every division had a two gun platoon for AA defense and 394 guns were converted. An unknown number of guns were also converted by Rheinmetall to stationary AA guns. This conversion entailed mounting the guns on a high-angle pedestal mount with a platform and 360¬∞ traverse. When the barrels became worn out they were replaced with German made ones of the same length without the distinctive muzzle roller guides of the French gun. The most common anti-aircraft configuration was a fixed battery of four mle 1915 guns located near cities, factories or military bases. Target range was measured by optical coincidence rangefinders and height by optical height finders which measured the distance to the target and the elevation angle, which together gave the height of the aircraft. These coordinates were transmitted to a single Brocq fire-control station, which was an electric tachymetric device that calculated target speed, altitude and direction to determine deflection angles. The deflection calculations were transmitted to displays on each gun for the crew to aim at for barrage fire. The guns themselves had only simple sights and lacked the ability to engage individual targets. Anti-aircraft effectiveness during the First World War was poor but many of these systems remained in use without improvement until the Second World War. By which time they were nearly useless against faster, higher flying targets. During the late 1920s it was realized that the mle 1897 was outmoded as an anti-aircraft weapon and development of a new gun barrel was begun in 1928. The goals of the rearmament program were faster rate of fire, higher muzzle velocity, increased vertical range, modern fire control and greater mobility with new gun carriages. Priority for armaments was given to the Maginot Line fortifications being built and work moved at a slow pace. Lack of funds meant all three anti-aircraft versions of the mle 1897 were still in use in large numbers when World War II began in 1939. It is estimated that 913 mle 1897 anti-aircraft guns were still in service in 1940. Modernizations * Canon de 75 mm antia√©rien mle 1928 GB - Increases in aircraft performance lead to a proposal in 1925 to improve the capabilities of DCA guns. The Manufacture d'Arme de Levallois (MLS) proposed replacing the old gun barrels with new 53 caliber barrels with muzzle brake built by Schneider. This raised muzzle velocity to and raised the effective ceiling to . * Canon de 75 mm antia√©rien mle 1917/34 - Some mle 1913 self- propelled guns and towed mle 1917 guns also had their barrels replaced with mle 1928 barrels to produce the Canon de 75 mm contre a√©ronefs mle 17/34. * Canon de 75 mm antia√©rien mle 1928/39 - An upgrade of the static mle 1915 platform guns with mle 1928 gun barrels. * Canon de 75 mm antia√©rien mle 1932 ABS - Atelier de Bourges (ABS) developed a new gun carriage with four folding cruciform outriggers. It used the same mle 1928 barrel and was equipped with an automatic breech which raised the rate of fire of 25 rounds per minute. The carriage was designed for motor traction and could be towed at and could be combat ready in 20 minutes. A total of 332 were in service in May 1940. * Canon de 75 mm antia√©rien mle 1933 - A competing model from Schneider with four folding cruciform outriggers. It used the same mle 1928 barrel, could fire 20 rounds per minute, could be towed at and could be combat ready in 30 minutes. A total of 192 were in service in May 1940. German Service Large numbers of 75 mm guns were captured by Germany after the French defeat in 1940. Guns in German service were called: * 7.5 cm FK 97(f) - These were un- modernized mle 1897 guns. Some were sold to Axis satellites, some were converted to 7.5 cm Pak 97/38 anti-tank guns and others were integrated into Atlantic Wall defenses. * 7.5 cm Flak M.17/34(f) - Modernized mle 17/34 guns in German service as anti-aircraft guns.

He is a professor at the Coll√®ge de France and was also its administrator. He is a member of the French Academy of sciences.  Biography  Student of Professor Denise Albe Fessard, Jacques Glowinski took his first steps in research in 1960 at the Marey Institute (Coll√®ge de France) and the Radioactive Isotopes Laboratory of the Pasteur Institute (Directors G√©rard Milhaud and J.P Aubert). After synthesizing radioactive dopamine, he conducted the first studies on the cerebral metabolism of dopamine and norepinephrine, which were marked. From 1963 to 1966, he was invited to continue his work at the National Institute of Health (Bethesda, United States) as part of Julius Axelrod's team (Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1972) in the prestigious Clinical Sciences Laboratory directed by S. Kety, pioneer with L. Sokolof in brain circulation studies. During this internship, Jacques Glowinski also collaborates with L. Iversen and S. Snyder and publishes, among his hundreds of publications, about twenty articles on the brain metabolism of catecholamines and demonstrates in particular the mechanism of action of tricyclic antidepressants. On his return, Jacques Glowinski was appointed Inserm researcher. He created a small research group at the Coll√®ge de France in the Chair of Neurophysiology under Professor Alfred Fessard and quickly established a fruitful collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry. This group quickly became an Inserm Research Unit and has continued to develop, particularly after Jacques Glowinski's appointment as Chair of Neuropharmacology at the Coll√®ge de France (1981). This laboratory has trained a large number of researchers, many of whom have founded their own laboratories in France and abroad.  Scientific contribution  Neurotransmission, neuropeptides (including tachykinins), metabolic and functional properties of monoaminergic and cholinergic regulatory systems, neural circuits of the basal ganglia, relationships between the prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia, development of dopaminergic systems, properties of astrocytes and astrocyto-neuronal relationships, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, drug addiction, neurotoxicity, these were the main research areas of this laboratory, which has developed various research avenues. His interest in science policy, his organizational skills and his taste for architecture and urban planning have also led him to participate in other projects. Thus, shortly after his appointment as Vice-President of the Assembly of Professors of the Coll√®ge de France (1991), Jacques Glowinski was appointed by his colleagues to be responsible for the Institution's renovation project as part of the President of the Republic's Major Works, a task that continued during his tenure as Director (2000-2006) and which will end in 2013. After having been a member of the Campus Plan Commission (2008), Jacques Glowinski was appointed by Mrs Val√©rie P√©cresse, Minister of Higher Education and Research, to carry out a scientific and urban planning coordination mission for the Plateau de Saclay campus plan (2009-2010).  Distinctions  Jacques Glowinski and his collaborators have been awarded several prizes: the Richard Lounsbery Prize for Biology and Medicine (1986), the Grand Prize of the Foundation for Medical Research (2002), the Inserm Honorary Prize (2005) and the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology Life time Award (2008). Jacques Glowinski has been a member of several national commissions and the Inserm Governing Council (CODIS, 1982-1991), President of the Society of Neurosciences (1995-1999), co-founder and President of the Scientific Council of the Brain Research Federation (BRC) and, more recently, in charge of preparing a national plan for the brain and nervous system diseases (2007). * He became a full member of the French Academy of sciences in 1992. * 2002: Grand Prize of the Foundation for Medical Research * 2005: Inserm Honorary Prize * Appointed Doctor Honoris causa of HEC * Appointed member of the editorial committee of the magazine Le Grand Paris 2011 * Appointed President of the Scientific Council of the Val de Seine School of Architecture ( 2011) * In 2016, Jacques Glowinski published a book on his career path, written with Fran√ßois Cardinali, \\"Le Cerveau Architecte\\", the Coll√®ge de France in the 21st century.

Life  Zalbide was born in San Sebasti√°n. He studied engineering at the University of Navarra. From a young age, he worked in those areas where Basque needed to be developed.  Terminology and lexicography  He has done extensive work in the planning of the corpus of Euskera. In 1972, while still a student, he was one of the founders of Elhuyar Kultur Elkartea. In addition to creating the first technical-scientific journal in Euskera, he took part in the preparation of didactic material and launched studies on word formation. Since the creation of UZEI (Unibertsitate Zerbitzuetarako Euskal Institutua) in 1978, he has been technically responsible for the area of science and technology. He worked at UZEI, among other things, in the dictionaries of Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. He also studied the formation of lexicon and taught courses on the subject. Finally, he is the author of the systematization work carried out in UZEI around the writing and pronunciation of lexical loans.  Education  From 1979, he was one of the participants of the initiative to create a Basque University. He was a member of the Joint Commission created by the pre-autonomous entity Basque General Council, and the University of Bilbao (later the University of the Basque Country). This joint commission was named \\"Commission for the planning of the Basque University\\" and within it was created a subcommittee on linguistic standardization. Mikel Zalbide was responsible for that working group. Since 1981, he has worked in the Department of Education, Universities and Research of the Basque Government, as head of the Euskera Service. He retired in 2014. As head of the Basque Department of the Department of Education, he has taken part in the main projects developed by the Administration to fix the teaching of Euskera and the levels of knowledge of that language. In the fields of pedagogy and education he has participated in the working groups for the implementation of various projects: the EIMA (Euskal Ikasmaterialgintza) program for the creation of didactic materials in Euskera (both textbooks for Primary Education and Secondary, as audiovisual material and software) and to ensure the quality of the language; the NOLEGA program and the ULIBARRI project, with the aim of reinforcing the use of Euskera in the school environment; the Plan for Euskaldunizar the Educational Administration.

It offers automated microscopy services using a coordinated combination of both hardware and software for the 3D analysis of cells, tissues, and organs. The company was founded in 2011 by Todd Huffman, Megan Klimen, Matthew Goodman, and Cody Daniel. The 3Scan technology is based on the Knife Edge Scanning Microscope developed in the late 1990s by Bruce McCormick, founder of the Brain Networks Lab at Texas A&M; University. History 3Scan CEO Todd Huffman originally worked as a neuroinformatics researcher at Texas A&M; in 2003 and first encountered the technology which became the core of 3Scan's microscopy services during this time. While the KESM was originally developed as a neuroimaging tool, 3Scan has taken the principles involved in this technology and expanded its use to create a novel type of histology and tissue imaging. The company has raised a total of $22 million through two rounds of equity funding from Lux Capital and Data Collective, joined by Dolby Family Ventures, OS Fund, Comet Labs, and Breakout Ventures. They have also raised $390,000 in non-dilutive grant money from institutions such as Breakout Labs and Start-Up Chile. The company employs about 35 full-time employees and generates revenue by providing its imaging services to pharmaceutical companies, labs, or pathologists involved in pre-clinical drug discovery. As of 2017, 3Scan is collaborating with pharmaceutical development scientists, academic researchers, and tissue engineers as a contract research organization. It is not currently used for clinical diagnostics, but is in the process of building out a platform to perform clinical pathology and diagnostic services. In 2018, cofounder Cody Daniel was named on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list. In 2019, 3Scan became a part of Strateos. Technology 3Scan‚Äôs technology changes the histology workflow to automate the process of tissue sectioning and imaging. Traditionally, histology slides are prepared by embedding a tissue sample in paraffin, taking some few slices of the tissue with a hand-driven microtome, mounting the tissue slices on slides, and staining with various histology stains. A pathologist then looks at these slides with a microscope. In the workflow developed by 3Scan, tissues are stained, embedded, and then sliced and imaged by the KESM. By automating this process, it becomes feasible to take slices of and image the entirety of tissue instead of a few representative slides. In addition to taking more sections, 3Scan‚Äôs proprietary software is able to computationally realign these sections in order to visualize the 3D structure of the tissue, similar in appearance to a CT scan. It uses machine vision to produce a 3D spatial map that researchers can analyze on a screen, similar to a topographical map of the Earth. Using these maps, scientists are also able to analyze parts of tissue and phenomena that were previously not visible, such as changes to blood flow between different tissue samples. This analysis is not possible using traditional manual histology techniques due to the excessive time involved and lost sections due to folding and warping. 3Scan‚Äôs KESM technology is able to perform approximately a year‚Äôs worth of tissue sample processing in a single day.

Biography  Education  He was a student at the √âcole normale sup√©rieure from 1955 to 1959 and passed the Agr√©gation of biology in his final year, a highly competitive postgraduate examination which serves as a national ranking of students. Then he devoted his thesis to a problem of organization of nerves (the analysis of the circuits involved in the startle reaction of the anaesthetized cat to chloralose). He became a Doctor of Science in 1965.  Career  Philippe Ascher is interested in the ionic mechanisms associated with the action of neurotransmitters. On Aplysian neurons, he studied the inhibitory and excitatory effects of dopamine, and the rapid excitatory actions of acetylcholine. In the study of mammalian neurons, he participated in the characterization of L-glutamate receptors, particularly those activated by N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA receptors). He discovered the role of Mg ions in the functioning of these receptors, and the modulating role of glycine. He then studied the role of NMDA receptors in the plasticity of cerebellar synapses. In 1965 he met a post-doctoral student named JacSue Keohe, whom he married in 1967 and with whom he had a scientific collaboration throughout his career. In 1971 at the √âcole normale sup√©rieure (ENS), he founded the Neurobiology Laboratory, of which he was director until 2001.

It consists of three parts: the first is a well-illustrated discussion of the history of mining in the area from the proto-Iberian era to the present. The second part describes most of the important mines, as well as the methods of profit used. The third part is a description of the minerals that have been found there, accompanied by 100 photos of mineral samples from their own collection. He has also collaborated in the publication of several books, such as \\"Atlas de Asociaciones Minerales en l√°minas Prima\\" by Professor Joan Carles Melgarejo, \\"Minerales de Espa√±a\\" by Joaqu√≠n Mollfulleda, \\"Minerales y Minas de Espa√±a\\" by Miguel Calvo, and \\"Els Minerals de Catalunya\\" by Eugeni Bareche.

Does the article \\"Anthropogenic Silver?\\" who wrote about the silver of the Balcoll mine in Falset (Tarragona), a mine exploited since the fourteenth century by the Counts of the Mountains of Prades and lords of the Barony of Entenza, which describes as specimens of acantite can be used to create samples of silver wire made by man, it was translated immediately into several other languages. The silver crystals of this place are the best specimens obtained in Spain due to their aesthetic crystallization.  Discoveries  One of the most significant contributions of Abella has been to increase the knowledge of the mineral heritage of the country, for having found, analyzed and published information on a variety of mineral species that had not previously been found in the territory. Some of these minerals are the xanthoconite of the Balcoll mine (Falset), the hopeite of La Cresta mine (Bellmunt del Priorat), the natronambulite of Joaquima mine (also in Bellmunt del Priorat), and arsenuranilite and ƒçejkaite from the Eureka mine (Torre de Cabdella, Lleida). The discovery of this last species in the Torre de Cabdella was the second event in the world. The finding of the breithauptite in the Balcoll mine also stands out, the best crystallized specimens of this species never to date anywhere in the world. In 2015, the International Mineralogical Association approved as a new species, the abellaite, named in this way in his honor. It was discovered at the Eureka mine, at Castell-esta√≥ (La Torre de Cabdella, Lleida). This discovery was the first type locality in Catalonia, being the first mineral discovered in the territory.

It was first excavated by Heinrich and Sophia Schliemann in the 1870s and is believed to have flourished in the Mid- to Late Bronze Age. The fortifications of Mycenae were built with the use of Cyclopean masonry. With the citadel built on a cliff, the architects created protection not only for the upper class that lived within the walls, but the lower-class farmers in the surrounding areas, who could find refuge there in times of war. Due to high competition in the Mid to Late Bronze Age, the citadel wall expanded significantly with the inclusion of Grave Circle A and the addition of the Lion Gate.  Citadel Walls (expansion and inclusion of Grave Circle A)  Lion gate and example of Cyclopean masonry at Mycenae Mycenaean gold ring, from Grave circle, depicting a battle scene and demonstrating that warriors, traditionally, held weapons in their right hand. Which meant a shield would be held on their left arm. Mycenae had a wall of large, irregular stones that were laid together without mortar. The walls of the citadel expanded over the Late Helladic III (LH III) period, the reason believed to be region competition. In the LH IIIB period, competition between regions led to the \\"enlargement\\" of the cities. This expansion not only included the creation of the Lion Gate and Postern Gate, but also the inclusion of Grave Circle A within the walls of the citadel. The Postern Gate in the back of the citadel was believed to be a back entrance for citizens from the surrounding area to enter in times of attack.  Cyclopean masonry  The masonry used to build the citadel wall surrounding Mycenae was of limestone. Due to the size and weight of these stones, too heavy to be lifted by an average human, later Greeks that discovered these fortifications believed them to be the work of the Cyclopes. Therefore, the stone walls' design was named \\"Cyclopean\\" masonry, due to the belief that these \\"giants\\" built the walls. However, archaeologists believe the walls were inspired by the fortifications of the Hittite capital of Hattusa. The first \\"Cyclopean\\" wall was built in the Late Helladic IIIA period then expanded to include Grave Circle A in the LH IIIB period.  Lion Gate  The structure of the \\"main entrance\\" had a military attack advantage built into it. In order to enter, an invading army would have to turn right around a high bastion protruding out of the right side of the gate. Warriors of the period, traditionally, held their shields on their left arm and their weapons in their right hand, which is displayed in pieces from the time, including a gold ring with a battle scene. With the warriors' right sides facing the bastion, it allowed for Mycenaean people to open fire on the exposed side of the warriors. Another significant fact about the gate is that above the door, there were two figures of giant felines. Due to this fact, the entrance was appropriately named the \\"Lion Gate\\" Lions likely inhabited modern Greece during the Bronze Age, but were driven back to Thrace by the time of the Classical Age. The overall symbolism of the lions above the gate is not totally clear, but, it is believed that this was also inspired by the main entrance of Hattusa.

The fire The Railroad Fire was reported on August 29, 2017 in the area between the communities of Sugar Pine and Fish Camp the Sierra National Forest. The cause is unknown. On September 3, mandatory evacuations were ordered for the Sky Ranch Road area due to the fire spreading towards residential areas after a storm, including the Cedar Valley Subdivision. On Labor Day crews wrapped historic structures in the Nelder Grove Historic Area, including cabins dating back to the late 1800s, in protective, heat-shielding material. As of September 7, Pacific Gas & Electric began working to re-establish electricity in the fire area and increased humidity overnight helped slow the fire. By September 10, the fire had burned and was 70% contained, with 1,035 personnel fighting the fire. Crews were pulled from the fire lines on the evening of September 11 due to thunderstorms that brought a quarter inch of rain into the area. On October 24, the wildfire was fully contained. Air quality The air quality in the area has declined rapidly due to the fire, which is burning along with two others in the region. Yosemite National Park reported that air quality was \\"unhealthy\\" in the park as of September 6. Additionally, the US Forest Service reported that air quality was \\"hazardous\\" in Wawona. That same day, Yosemite High School released students early from school due to poor air quality. Closures and evacuations Closures were put in place due to the close proximity of the Railroad Fire to park roads Three Sierra National Forest campgrounds are closed: Summerdale, Big Sandy and Nelder. As of June 9, 2018, Big Sandy and Nelder campgrounds are open. The Shadow of the Giants loop trail in Nelder Grove is closed by order of the Forest Service due to hazard trees, burned bridges, destabilized trail soils, and two large open holes where pit toilets burned.

He has been in charge of the genetic diagnosis laboratory at the University Hospitals of Strasbourg since 1992, as well as a professor at the Coll√®ge de France (Chair of Human Genetics) since 2003.  Biography  Doctor of Medicine (1971) and Doctor of Science (1974) from the University of Strasbourg (theses prepared under the supervision of Prof. Pierre Chambon), Jean-Louis Mandel was Associate Professor of Biochemistry at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Strasbourg from 1978 to 1984, then Professor of Medical Genetics at the same Faculty from 1984 to 2003 before being appointed to the Chair of Human Genetics at the Coll√®ge de France. He leads a research team in human genetics at the LGME (Laboratoire de G√©n√©tique Mol√©culaire des Eucaryotes, directed by Pierre Chambon) which became the Institute of Genetics and Molecular and Cellular Biology (IGBMC) in 1994. He started a molecular diagnosis of genetic diseases in 1985, which became the genetic diagnosis laboratory at the University Hospitals of Strasbourg in 1992, for which he has been responsible since then. Jean-Louis Mandel was appointed Director of the Institute of Genetics and Molecular and Cellular Biology (IGBMC) from 2002 to 2007, following its founder Pierre Chambon, then Deputy Director from 2007 to 2009. From 2008 to 2009, he was Director of the Mouse Clinic (ICS). He has also been a full member of the French Academy of sciences since 1999Acad√©mie des sciences : Jean-Louis Mandel , CV sur le site de l'Acad√©mie des sciences : www.academie-sciences.fr. and a corresponding member of the French Academy of Medicine.  Scientific contribution  Since 1982, Jean-Louis Mandel has been working on the identification of genes and mutations responsible for rare inherited monogenic diseases affecting the nervous system and/or muscles. He has also contributed to the development of diagnostic tests and the analysis of pathophysiological mechanisms for several of these diseases, using animal or cellular models in particular. His most important contribution concerns the identification and characterization of the mutation mechanism by unstable expansion of trinucleotide repetition. In 1991, his team showed that Fragile X mental retardation syndrome, the most common cause of hereditary intellectual disability, is due to the expansion of a CGG repetition associated with localized abnormal DNA methylation (Oberl√© et al. Sciences, 1991). From 1995 to 1997 his team (with notably Yvon Trottier), in collaboration with Alexis Brice's team (H√¥pital Piti√© Salp√©tri√®re) identified polyglutamine expansions as pathogenic epitopes in Huntington's disease and four other dominant ataxias, which led to the identification of genes involved in the spinocerebellar ataxias SCA2 and SCA7 (Trottier et al, Nature, 1995, Imbert et al. Nat Genet 1996, David et al. Nat Genet 1997). In 1996, with Michel Koenig and Massimo Pandolfo, he showed that Friedreich's Ataxia, a neurodegenerative disease, is caused by the expansion of a GAA repetition in the gene encoding a protein of unknown function, frataxin, and participates in clinical and genetic studies on this disease (D√ºrr et al, NEJM, 1996). Jean-Louis Mandel has also identified the genes responsible for adrenoleukodystrophy, with Patrick Aubourg (Mosser et al, Nature, 1993), ataxia with isolated vitamin E deficiency with Michel Koenig (Ouahchi et al, Nature Genetics, 1995), Coffin- Lowry syndrome (mental retardation linked to chromosome X) with Andr√© Hanauer (Trivier et al, Nature, 1996). His work with Jocelyn Laporte has led to the identification of the mutated MTM1 gene in X-linked myotubular myopathy (Laporte et al Nat Genet 1996) and more recently the mutated BIN1 gene in autosomal recessive centronuclear myopathy (Nicot et al, Nature Genet, 2007). For several years, Jean-Louis Mandel has concentrated a significant part of his activity on the development of effective strategies for the molecular diagnosis of monogenic intellectual deficiencies, which affect more than 1% of the population and are characterized by extreme genetic heterogeneity, and for a better clinical knowledge of these different genetic forms (projet GenIDA [2] [archive]) (Piton et al, AJHG, 2013, and Redin et al.

A cryptocurrency wallet is a device, physical medium, program or a service which stores the public and/or private keys. In addition to this basic function of storing the keys, they more often also offer the functionality of encrypting and/or signing information. Signing can for example result in executing a smart contract, a cryptocurrency transaction (see \\"bitcoin transaction\\" image), identification or legally signing a 'document' (see \\"application form\\" image).  Characteristics  In addition to the basic function of storing the keys, a cryptocurrency wallet may also have one or more of the following characteristics. Simple cryptocurrency wallet An actual bitcoin transaction from a web based cryptocurrency exchange to a hardware cryptocurrency wallet. A simple cryptocurrency wallet contains pairs of public and private cryptographic keys. The keys can be used to track ownership, receive or spend cryptocurrencies. A public key allows others to make payments to the address derived from it, whereas a private key enables the spending of cryptocurrency from that address. The cryptocurrency itself is not in the wallet. In the case of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies derived from it, the cryptocurrency is decentrally stored and maintained in a publicly available distributed ledger called the blockchain. eID wallet Providing an eID and a diploma and digitally signing the 'application form' with a crypto wallet app. Some wallets are specifically designed to be compatible with a framework. The European Union is creating an eIDAS compatible European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework (ESSIF) which runs on the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI). The EBSI wallet is designed to (securely) provide information, an eID and to sign 'transactions'. Multisignature wallet In contrast to simple cryptocurrency wallets requiring just one party to sign a transaction, multisignature wallets require multiple parties to sign a transaction. Multisignature wallets are designed to have increased security. Smart contract In the cryptocurrency space, smart contracts are digitally signed in the same way a cryptocurrency transaction is signed. The signing keys are held in a crypto(currency) wallet. Key derivation =Deterministic wallet= A deterministic wallet seed phrase of a crypto wallet. With a deterministic wallet a single key can be used to generate an entire tree of key pairs. This single key serves as the root of the tree. The generated mnemonic sentence or word seed is simply a more human-readable way of expressing the key used as the root, as it can be algorithmically converted into the root private key. Those words, in that order, will always generate exactly the same root key. A word phrase could consist of 24 words like: begin friend black earth beauty praise pride refuse horror believe relief gospel end destroy champion build better awesome. That single root key is not replacing all other private keys, but rather is being used to generate them. All the addresses still have different private keys, but they can all be restored by that single root key. The private keys to every address it has and will ever give out in the future can be recalculated given the root key. That root key, in turn, can be recalculated by feeding in the word seed. The mnemonic sentence is the backup of the wallet. If a wallet supports the same (mnemonic sentence) technique, then the backup can also be restored on another software or hardware wallet. A mnemonic sentence is considered secure. The BIP-39 standard creates a 512-bit seed from any given mnemonic. The set of possible wallets is 2512. Every passphrase leads to a valid wallet. If the wallet was not previously used it will be empty. =Non-deterministic wallet= In a non-deterministic wallet, each key is randomly generated on its own accord, and they are not seeded from a common key. Therefore, any backups of the wallet must store each and every single private key used as an address, as well as a buffer of 100 or so future keys that may have already been given out as addresses but not received payments yet. Wallet access When choosing a wallet, the owner must keep in mind who is supposed to have access to (a copy of) the private keys and thus potentially has signing capabilities. In case of cryptocurrency the user needs to trust the provider to keep the cryptocurrency safe. Just like with a bank. Trust was misplaced in the case of the Mt. Gox exchange, which 'lost' most of their clients' bitcoins. Downloading a cryptocurrency wallet from a wallet provider to a computer or phone does not automatically mean that the owner is the only one who has a copy of the private keys. For example, with Coinbase, it is possible to install a wallet on a phone and to also have access to the same wallet through their website. A wallet can also have known or unknown vulnerabilities. A supply chain attack or side-channel attack are ways of a vulnerability introduction. In extreme cases even a computer which is not connected to any network can be hacked.Air- gap jumpers on cyber.bgu.ac.il For receiving cryptocurrency, access to the receiving wallet is not needed. The sending party only needs to know the destination address. Anyone can send cryptocurrency to an address. Only the one who has the private key of the corresponding (public key) address can use it.

Relatively few analyses have been conducted to identify the phylogenetic placement of Aleodon, however those that have place Aleodon as a sister taxon to Chiniquodon. Two species of Aleodon are recognized: A. brachyramphus which was discovered in Tanzania, and A. cromptoni which was discovered most recently in Brazil. The name for the genus Aleodon was created when Alfred W. Crompton initially discovered the type species, Aleodon brachyramphus. The genus name, \\"Aleodon\\" referred to the grinding nature of the postcanine teeth, while \\"brachyramphus\\" referred to the relatively short snout of the specimen. The most recently discovered species, A. cromptoni was named after Alfred W. \\"Fuzz\\" Crompton, who originally described the genus Aleodon.  Discovery and Classification  In 1955, Aleodon was initially classified as a gomphodont cynodont based on the partial skull and lower jaw fossils found in 1933 in Tanzania. The classification was based on the presence of three types of post-canines that were identified in the fossil that were similar to another well-known gomphodont, Diademodon tetragonus. It was later argued in 2001 by Hopson and Kitching that Aleodon be classified under Chiniquodontidae based on less-worn dentition of unpublished specimens. This classification was accepted by many sources. However, a study done the following year by Abdala and Gianni found, based on fossils found in Namibia, that Aleodon (and Cromptodon) both had well developed lingual cingular platforms in their post-canines, a characteristic that Chiniquodontidae did not possess. While not many analysis have been done to clarify the phylogenetic relationship of Aleodon thus far, those that have been done describe Aleodon as the sister taxon of Chiniquodon.  Description   Dentition  Lower jaw of Aleodon showing the postcanine patterning and long osseous secondary palate. The dentition of Aleodon is the most significant morphological feature to distinguish it against other genera. Crompton pointed out three distinct regions of the postcanine row: anterior circular, transversely expanded ovate, and sectorial posterior teeth (described as ‚Äúshearing‚Äù by Crompton). These three regions of post canines were very similar to a well-known gomphodont, Diademodon tetragonus (which led Crompton to believe that Aleodon was part of Gomphodonta). Crompton also noted that Aleodon uniquely possessed two incisors on the lower jaw which differs from most cynodonts which primitively had four. Based on more fossils, Aleodon was also found to have a long secondary palate, a characteristic that was shared with members of the monophyletic group Chiniquodontidae and resulted in Aleodon's reidentification to Probainognathia from Gomphodonta. Shortly after, specimens of Aleodon showed the possession of well-developed lingual cingular platforms on the post canines. This finding resulted in some researchers removing Aleodon from Chiniquodontidae due to the group not characterized in possessing well-developed lingual cingular platforms. The lingual cingular platform that is expanded in both labiolingual and mesiodistal dimensions relative to the labial portion of the crown is also the most developed of all Triassic Probainognathians. These observations led some researchers to believe that Aleodon (along with Candelariodon) may be specimens that exhibit the gradual development of the cingular platform. Lateral view of Aleodon skull.  Skull  Based on specimens found in Brazil, Aleodon was found to share the same general cranial morphology of Chiniquodontidae. Diagnostic features of Chiniquodontidae are zygomatic arches flaring laterally, angulation between the ventral edge of the maxillary zygomatic process and the anteroventral margin of the jugal, elongated pterygoid flanges that end in a thin projection, and a long secondary palate. When Aleodon was first characterized by Crompton, he noted the presence of a pineal foramen, however later specimens showed no evidence of a pineal foramen on the skull of Aleodon. Aleodon is also characterized by its relatively short snout.  Geological/Paleoenvironmental Information   Manda Formation (Tanzania)  Specimens of Aleodon were first recovered from the Triassic Manda Beds of Tanzania by Parrington in the 1930s. The Manda Beds were first surveyed by Gordon M. Stockley from June to October 1930. There was further collection by Parrington and Nowack in the 1930s in which Aleodon brachyramphus was later described by Crompton. The collections showed that the Manda Beds contained fauna thecodontians, cynodonts, and dicynodonts, as well as a large amphibian and a rhynchosaur. The formation was described as being 2000 meters thick with purple to brown mudstones with grey sandstones in between. From 60 to 150 meters below the top of the formation reptile bones were found while most (65%) of specimens were found 1180 meters and 1310 meters below the surface.  Omingonde Formation (Namibia)  Map of localities in Rio Grande do Sul with Aleodon cromptoni as well as skeletal reconstruction based on bones that have been found (in yellow).(Martinelli et al. 2017) Fossil vertebrates in the Omingonde Formation of Namibia were first found and published by Keyser in 1973. Among the fossils he described amphibians, cynodonts and dicynodonts. The cynodonts were initially represented by Cynognathus and herbivorous gomphodonts. After the discovery of Aleodon among other cynodont specimens such as Chiniquodon, Luangwa, and an unidentified traversodontid in 2009, the Omingonde Formation of Namibia is considered to possess the most diverse fauna of Middle Triassic cynodonts in the world. The discovery also provided researchers a definite link between two faunas in South America and East Africa. From this, the Omingonde formation was also considered the key in ‚Äúreconstructing the biogeography of Southern Gondwana during the Middle Triassic‚Äù.  Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil)  Most recently a new species of Aleodon (A. cromptoni) was found in the Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil. The specimens were first collected in 1988 by Daniel and Abra√£o Cargnin.

It was a two- bladed \\"lee runner\\" (the rotor was situated on the downwind side of the tower) with a hub height of about . For a long time Growian was the world's largest wind turbine. Many features of the installation were novel and had not previously been trialled at this scale. Due to manufacturing faults in the casing, the turbine could not be run at full performance, and various issues with materials and construction prevented continuous testing. Consequently, the installation was idle for the greater part of the period between the first test run on 6 July 1983 (official start of operations was 4 October 1983) and end of operations in August 1987. Growian was decommissioned over the course of 1987, and dismantled in summer 1988.  Technical data  GROWIAN with its two wind gauge pylons Growian's power rating was 3,000 kW, at the time the highest in the world. The rotor had an oscillating nave, a diameter of , and revolved at approximately 19.5 rpm. The orientation of the two blades was regulated by a mechanical-electrical mechanism. In contrast to most modern turbines, the blades rotated on the leeward side of the tower. The turbine house at a height of weighed 340 t, and each blade weighed 23 t. The turbine had a switching on speed of and a rated speed of . It would cut out at a speed of and was rated for a maximum survivable speed of . Projected annual energy yield at a mean wind speed of was approximately 12 GWh. Rotor and induction generator were mechanically coupled by a gearing mechanism consisting of one spur gear and two epicyclic gears. Feed-in to the power grid was realized using a set of motor‚Äìgenerators that was largely identical to that later used at , one of the few electrical substations that allowed for electricity import from the GDR. The rotors were constructed using steel walers, and in cross section consisted of a steel core, an outer skin and fibreglass reinforcement rods. The tower and one of the rotors are on display at the Auto & Technik Museum Sinsheim. The total cost of the installation was about 87 million Deutsche Mark.  Development and outcomes  Growian rotor blade with museum logo at Auto & Technik Museum Sinsheim Towards the end of 1976, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMFT) decided to use research contracts and expert consultation to investigate the development of large wind turbines. This decision, taken as a result of public pressure, ran contrary to the stalling efforts of the major energy providers. Contracts were awarded to MAN SE , the Institute for Aerodynamics and Gas Dynamics at the University of Stuttgart, and the University of Regensburg. In 1978 the BMFT decided to construct the world's largest wind turbine with a tower height and blade diameter of 100 m. MAN SE was chosen as main contractor, and the formation of a construction and operation company was given into the charge of the reluctant (HEW). This led to the formation of the Growian GmbH on 8 January 1980, of which HEW held 46.7%, held 30.1%, and RWE held 23.2%. Overall and technical direction were the responsibility of HEW, while Schleswag dealt with commercial management. The basic contract between the partners of 3 January 1978 stipulated that after the project's conclusion, the installation was \\"anticipated to be dismantled and scrapped\\". The partners as well as the BMFT also had political motives connected with the project. G√ºnther Kl√§tte, management board member of RWE, stated during a general business meeting: \\"We require Growian [ _in the general sense of large wind turbines_ ] as a proof of failure of concept\\", and he noted that \\"the Growian is a kind of pedagogical tool to convert the anti-nuclear energy crowd to the true faith\\". A similar statement regarding the incurred financial burdens was reported of Minister of Finance and former Minister of Research Hans Matth√∂fer: \\"We know it won't do anything for us. But we do it to demonstrate to the wind energy advocates that it doesn't work.\\" After the Green Party had derided the installation as the electricity provider's \\"fig leaf\\" on the occasion of groundbreaking in May 1981, the RWE took internal measures to make sure that publicly a position of open-mindedness towards alternative energy production was emphasized while public interest in wind energy was allayed. Insuperable structural load and material problems occurred, not least due to the two- bladed lee runner configuration. The installation turned out to be a failure in most respects, spent substantially more time under repair than up and running, and was not even capable of sustained test operation. When it was decommissioned it had only logged a total of 420 hours in active operation. Growian is regarded as one of the largest failures in the history of wind power and was unable to fulfill any of the expectations riding on its conception. What few insights were gained found little application in wind turbine construction. Some lessons were however learned from conceptional mistakes made in its construction, e.g., the futility of trying to reach profitable installation sizes without taking intermediate steps. The point of view that multi-MW-yield wind turbines were technically and commercially infeasible gained some currency after the failure of the project, but was eventually superseded by technical progress. Beginning with the late 2000s, twenty-five years after Growian was decommissioned, installations with identical dimensions and yield (100 m rotor diameter, 3 MW net yield) were being produced in large numbers, a class of turbines that has continued to dominate the market and to push forward the mean net yield of newly installed turbines. As of 2015, substantially larger installations with yields up to 8 MW and rotor diameters of up to 170 m are present in the offshore sector. In contrast to Growian, however, these turbine types were incrementally developed from smaller installations in the 0.1 MW range. Growian's former locations is still being used for wind power generation. In 1988, Germany's first wind farm, the , was built on a 20 hectare section of the former test area. It initially comprised 30 smaller turbines with net yields of 10-25 kW, provided by three different wind turbine manufacturers. After being repowered twice, the wind farm today consists of four major installations with 1-2 MW yield, in addition to a test area for small wind turbines and an information center presenting the history of wind power.

The type and only species is Parasuminia ivakhnekoi. It was closely related to Suminia, another Russian anomodont, and was named for its resemblance (\\"similar to Suminia\\"). Little is known about Parasuminia as the only fossils are of fragmentary pieces of the skull and jaw, but the known remains suggest that its head and jaws were deeper and more robust than those of Suminia, and with shorter, stouter teeth. However, despite these differences they appear to have been similar animals with a similarly complex method of processing vegetation. Description Parasuminia is only known from incomplete remains of the lower jaw and the front of the snout. Compared to Suminia, the lower jaw is deeper and more robust, and is down-turned towards its tip with a deep, rounded 'chin'. The teeth in both the upper and lower jaws are lower and wider than in Suminia, with serrated edges only found on the newest replacement teeth before being worn away. The tooth row consists of 10 to 12 teeth and is straight along its surface, with longer procumbent (forward projecting) incisors at the tip of the lower jaw to accommodate the down-turned tip. Likewise, the premaxilla from the front of the upper jaw is also taller than in Suminia and with relatively shorter teeth. The tips of the upper jaw are similarly deflected upwards, opposing the down-turned lower jaw, and the front teeth are also procumbent. Although incomplete, the total length of the skull was estimated to be roughly long, slightly larger than the long skull of Suminia. The parietal bone from the back of the skull roof is larger and proportionately wider than it is in Suminia, and completely surrounds the circular pineal foramen (or \\"third eye\\"). The pineal foramen itself is raised slightly above the surface of the skull; however, it is less raised than the chimney-like structure in Suminia and has more gently sloping sides. In contrast with the smooth surface of the rest of the parietal, the bone around the pineal foramen has a rugose texture, imprinted with blood vessels. History of Discovery Fossils of Parasuminia are known exclusively from a locality known as Sundyr-1 near the mouth of the Sundyr River (a tributary to the Volga River) in the Mari El Republic of European Russia, and were first discovered in 2009 by an expedition from the Borissiak Paleontological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow. The site itself was originally discovered by a group of schoolboys in 1997, and the site and its fossils were briefly reported on by A. Yu. Bezerin in 2005 who referred to the site as the \\"Yul‚Äôyaly locality\\". The site was later renamed Sundyr-1 and interpreted to belong to a new stratigraphic member, the Ustpoldarsa Member, of the Poldarsa Formation. The fossil fauna recovered from Sundyr-1 have been collated into the Sundyr Assemblage Zone, interpreted as representing an intermediate fauna between the older Middle Permian 'dinocephalian faunas' and later 'theriodontian faunas' of the Late Permian. The Sundyr Assemblage has been interpreted as belonging to the lower Upper Severodvinian stage in Russian stratigraphy, correlating to the upper Capitanian stage of the International Stratigraphic Scale dating to approximately 259 million years ago. The remains of Parasuminia were initially referred to as 'aff. Suminia', and were later described as a distinct genus and species in 2017 by A. A. Kurkin. The holotype specimen, PIN no. 5388/196, consists of a partial pair of lower jaws with teeth. Other specimens include numerous lower jaw fragments, a single partial premaxilla and many isolated teeth. An isolated right parietal, PIN no. 5388/198, may also belong to Parasuminia. The remains of Parasuminia currently consist only of fragmented, disarticulated pieces of skull as well as isolated pairs of dentaries that remain held together by strong suturing at the jaw tips. The generic name is from the Latin \\"para\\" (\\"close\\", \\"similar\\") and the genus Suminia for its close resemblance and relationship to the latter. The specific name is in memory of the palaeontologist M.F. Ivakhnenko and in recognition of his \\"outstanding\\" work on Russian palaeontology. Classification Parasuminia was assigned to the family Galeopidae by Kurkin, a family originally erected solely for the South African anomodont Galeops by palaeontologist Robert Broom in 1912. Galeops was formerly included in a group of small anomodonts known as the 'dromasaurs' together with Galechirus and Galepus, however, phylogenetic analyses of anomodonts have since shown that 'dromasaurs' are polyphyletic and so are not a natural group of related species. However, Kurkin assigned Parasuminia to Galeopidae based on an alternative taxonomic classification for anomodonts (as well as other synapsids) proposed by Russian palaeontologist M. F. Ivakhnenko. Under Ivakhnenko's taxonomy, the family Galeopidae consists of the traditional 'dromasaurs' as well as other anomodonts, including Suminia and Anomocephalus, and is classed within the suborder Dromasaurida, itself under the order Dicynodontia proper. Ivakhnenko proposed galeopids were grouped together for their use a palinal jaw stroke (pulling their lower jaw backwards to chew), a trait they share with dicynodonts which he considered to indicate they shared a common ancestry. This opposes modern orthodox phylogenetic classifications of anomodonts, which do not group these anomodonts together within a single clade. Parasuminia has yet to be included in a phylogenetic analysis of anomodonts, and so its evolutionary relationships outside of this scheme are unclear. However, Parasuminia was referred to the Venyukovioidea, a clade that includes Suminia but not any of the 'dromasaurs', by palaeontologists Kenneth Angielczyk and Christian Kammerer in 2018. Palaeobiology Like other related anomodonts, Parasuminia would have been a herbivore. Due to the similarity of the wear marks left on the teeth of Parasuminia to those of Suminia, it is likely that they both fed in a similar fashion with extensive tooth-on-tooth occlusion. Furthermore, although the jaw joint of Parasuminia is unknown, it can be inferred from the pattern of wear that Parasuminia was capable of a palinal jaw stroke to shred vegetation. This complex method of chewing is shared with both Suminia and the dicynodonts. Palaeoecology In the Sundyr Assemblage fauna, Parasuminia coexisted with two large carnivorous therocephalians, the predatory scylacosaurid Julognathus and the suggested scavenger Gorynychus sundyrensis. Large herbivores are poorly known, and are only represented by dinocephalians possibly similar to Ulemosaurus. A number of early tetrapods are also known from this assemblage, including Leptoropha aff. talonophora, Microphon, Enosuchus sp., and the chroniosuchian Suchonica, as well as the temnospondyl amphibian Dvinosaurus sp. The Sundyr Assemblage fauna has been considered to be a 'crisis fauna', representing the last of the dinocephalian dominated faunas in Eurasia at the end of the Middle Permian and transitioning into the theriodontian dominated faunas of the Late Permian.

She submitted work to the Intercolonial Juvenile Industrial Exhibition at Melbourne in 1880 and won a silver medal. Around 1881, Sperrey traveled to Rome to study portraiture with Giuseppe Ferrari. Her study of an Italian goatherd won a gold medal in the Prix de Rome competition, and was considered her masterpiece. Before she returned home to New Zealand, Sperrey also studied in London and Paris. Italian goatherd, 1884, by Eleanor Catherine Sperrey. Gift of Miss K. A. Mair, 1912. Te Papa (1912-0029-1) Career Sperrey returned to New Zealand in 1884, moving to Wellington, where her father was living and working as the Commissioner of Taxation. She set up an office and became an official portrait artist, joining the New Zealand Art Students' Association in 1885. The organization, based in Auckland, encouraged members to paint solely subjects having to do with New Zealand. In 1886, she moved her studio to Lambton Quay. She participated in numerous exhibitions including the Otago Art Society's shows in both 1886 and 1887, the New South Wales Art Society 1886 Sydney Town Hall exhibit, the Auckland Society of Art's exhibitions of 1887 and 1888, the Centennial Exhibition of 1889 in Melbourne and the South Seas Exhibition of Dunedin in both 1889 and 1890. Bushstream alt= William Fitzherbert by Eleanor Catherine Sperry. Whangarei Art Museum Te Manawa Toialt= On 19 September 1888 in Wellington, Sperrey married Captain Gilbert Mair, whose portrait she had painted in 1886 when he had been awarded the New Zealand Cross. Mair was a soldier and civil servant, who had previously fathered two sons and a daughter with the NgƒÅti T≈´wharetoa woman, Keita Kupa. The new couple had two children of their own, John Gilbert, on 5 July 1889, who died in infancy, and Kathleen Irene, known as Airini, (1891‚Äì1965), who would become a noted artist under her married name, as K. Airini Vane. After her marriage Sperrey, continued painting, signing her works as E. K. Mair. In 1889, Mair created paintings which earned first, second and third prizes, in the oil and water colour category of the Melbourne Fine Art Exhibit. Predominantly known as a portrait artist, she painted the likenesses of such figures as Sir Harry Atkinson, John Ballance, Sir William Fitzherbert, Sir George Grey, and James Macandrew, among many others. She was also renowned for her paintings of MƒÅori subjects, some of which included Wairingiringi, a NgƒÅti Mahuta woman and her husband, Te Wahanui, a NgƒÅti Maniapoto tribal leader. In 1890, for New Zealand's Golden Jubilee, Musings in Maoriland, by Thomas Bracken was published outlining the colony's development of art and literature. The 400-page commemorative volume was illustrated with sepia sketches by Sperrey which were engraved in Nuremberg, Germany. Two of her last works were portraits of her own children. Death and legacy Mair died on 23 April 1893 in Blenheim, New Zealand and was buried in Wellington in the Bolton Street Cemetery, beside her father. Her self-portrait is in the collection of the Alexander Turnbull Library and her most noted work, Italian goatherd is in the collection of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. She also has works in Auckland Art Gallery and Christchurch Art Gallery. In 2000, a retrospective of her works were presented by the Whangarei Art Museum between January and March followed by a presentation at the Sarjeant Gallery, which ran through the end of May. The Whangarei Art Museum hosted an exhibit featuring two of Mair's works, in 2012. One was her portrait of Prime Minister Sir George Grey and the other was a painting of a bush scene. The two paintings had been in storage for a century and are now part of the museum's permanent collection.

Background There was much debate about the appropriate location and format for a war memorial in Sheffield after the First World War. A committee considered fourteen serious suggestions, including an obelisk at the junction of Bow Street and Church Street. Eventually a decision was made for a memorial to be constructed near the City Hall, with the demolition of shops to the north of Barker's Pool to create a suitable location. A design competition was opened to architects working in Sheffield, which was won by Charles Denny Carus- Wilson, then head of the School of Architecture at the University of Sheffield. He had served with the Middlesex Yeomanry and was awarded the Military Cross; the memorial was his first significant public project. The ¬£5,435 cost of the memorial was raised from public donations. Description The memorial is made up of a cenotaph with a high flagpole. The central flagpole is a ship's mast, made of mild steel by Earle's Shipbuilding of Hull. It is painted white, and topped by a gilded ball and crown. The pole is supported by a bronze base by sculptor George Alexander, cast by the Parlanti foundry. It includes four statues of soldiers, standing with heads bowed and rifles reversed, above an octagonal section. The base also shows four emblems - the British Army, the Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force, and the coat of arms of the city of Sheffield - facing the cardinal directions, and also the badges of the eight army units: the Queen's Own Yorkshire Dragoons, the Royal Artillery, the Royal Engineers, the Machine Gun Corps, the Tank Corps, the York and Lancaster Regiment, the Royal Army Medical Corps, and the Royal Army Service Corps. The bronze base stands on an octagonal plinth of Derbyshire Hopton Wood stone, surrounded by circular paving to form a traffic island. The original design featured four female figures between the male figures, but they were left out to reduce the cost. The memorial was unveiled on 28 October 1925 by General Sir Charles Harington Harington, GOC Northern Command, and it was dedicated by the Bishop of Sheffield Leonard Burrows. The memorial suffered shrapnel damage from bombing in the Second World War, which was left unrepaired. Further dates were added around the plinth after the Second World War. It became a listed building in 1983, upgraded to Grade II* in 2016. The memorial was restored after Barkers Pool was closed to traffic in 1989. Further restoration work took place in 2005, and the flag raising mechanism was replaced. Incidents In October 2009, a drunken Sheffield Hallam University student was photographed urinating on the memorial, during a night of heavy drinking organised for students by Carnage UK. The photograph was published by the Daily Mail's website, generating widespread public anger, and the student identified as 19-year old Philip Laing of Macclesfield, Cheshire. He was subsequently charged by police, and admitted to outraging public decency. Laing had been warned of the possibility of a jail sentence; however, in court, a judge sentenced him to 250 hours' community service. He was also ordered to pay costs of ¬£185. Other memorials Other war memorials in central Sheffield include a War Memorial Hall which opened at Sheffield City Hall in 1932 with a Roll of honour recording 5,000 names, and the York and Lancaster Regiment War Memorial in Weston Park.

It is the eldest park in Rostov-on-Don. The park was established in 1813 on the skirts of the city. Now it is located in center of Rostov-on-Don between Pushkinskaya street (Gorky Park North), Bolshaya Sadovaya street (Gorky Park South), Budyonovskiy avenue (Gorky Park West) and Semashko lane (Gorky Park East). History The park was established in arroyos, where dirty stream ran. Town dump occupied this place. Mayor of Rostov-on-Don Alexander Yashchenko owned the territory. He handed it to the city magistrate. Different private organizations improved the territory. The first trees, shrubs, and plants were transplanted to the park. There were several gardens initially, which were combined into the new urban park. The so-called Lower Park (Nizhny Park) and Upper Park (Verhny Park) has been formed through the terrain. A wooden building of the first Municipal Theatre opened in the northern side of the park in the 1840s. Wooden rotunda to relax of citizens was erected in 1864. It was replaced by stone building located on Pushkinskaya street alongside of main park entrance in 1893. Architect Nikolai Doroshenko designed an open-work fence and front entrance constructed in the shape of fortress gates. New entrance was located on Bolshaya Sadovaya street. Architect Vladimir Shkitko projected the first fountain in Rostov-on-Don called 'Boy with basin'.

The deep-blue color of the upper portion is attributable to Chappuis absorption. Chappuis absorption () refers to the absorption of electromagnetic radiation by ozone, which is especially noticeable in the ozone layer, which absorbs a small part of sunlight in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The Chappuis absorption bands occur at wavelengths between 400 and 650 nm. Within this range are two absorption maxima of similar height at 575 and 603 nm. Compared to the absorption of ultraviolet light by the ozone layer, known as the Hartley and Huggins absorptions, Chappuis absorption is distinctly weaker. Along with Rayleigh scattering, it contributes to the blue color of the sky, and is noticeable when the light has to travel a long path through the Earth's atmosphere. For this reason, Chappuis absorption only has a significant effect on the color of the sky at dawn and dusk, during the so- called blue hour. It is named after the French chemist James Chappuis (1854‚Äì1934), who discovered this effect.  History  James Chappuis was the first researcher (in 1880) to notice that light passing through ozone gas has a blue tint. He attributed this effect to absorption in the yellow, orange, and red parts of the light spectrum. The French chemist Auguste Houzeau had already shown in 1858 that the atmosphere contains traces of ozone, so Chappuis presumed that ozone could explain the blue color of the sky. He was certainly aware that this was not the only possible explanation, since the blue light that can be seen from Earth's surface is polarised. Polarization cannot be explained by light absorption by ozone, but can be explained by Rayleigh scattering, which was already known by Chappuis's time. Contemporary scientists thought that Rayleigh scattering was sufficient to explain the blue sky, and so the idea that ozone could play a role was eventually forgotten. In the early 1950s, Edward Hulburt was conducting research on the sky at dusk, to verify theoretical predictions on the temperature and density of the upper atmosphere on the basis of scattered light measured at the Earth's surface. The basic idea was that after the Sun passes under the horizon, it continues to illuminate the upper layers of the atmosphere. Hulburt wished to relate the intensity of light reaching the Earth's surface through Rayleigh scattering to the abundance of particles at each altitude, as the sunlight passes through the atmosphere at different heights over the course of sunset. In his measurements, performed in 1952 at Sacramento Peak in New Mexico, he found that the intensity of measured light was lower by a factor of 2 to 4 than the predicted value. His predictions were based on his theory, and on measurements that were made in the upper atmosphere only a few years before by rocket flights launched not far from Sacramento Peak. The magnitude of the deviation between prediction and photometric measurements made on Sacramento Peak precluded mere measurement error. Until then, theory had predicted that the sky at the zenith during sundown should appear blue-green to grey, and the color should shift to yellow during dusk. This was obviously in conflict with daily observation that the blue color of the sky in the zenith at dusk changes only imperceptibly. As Hulburt knew about the absorption by ozone, and as the spectral range of Chappuis absorption had been more precisely measured only a few years before by the French couple Arlette and √âtienne Vassy, he made an attempt to account for this effect in his calculations. This brought the measurements completely into agreement with the theoretical predictions. The results of Hulburt were repeatedly confirmed in the following years. Indeed, not all color effects at dusk in clear sky can be explained by the deeper layers. To this end it is probably necessary to account for spectral extinction by aerosols in theoretical simulations. Independently of Hulburt, the French meteorologist Jean Dubois had proposed a few years before that Chappuis absorption had an effect on another color phenomenon of the sky at dusk. Dubois worked on the so-called \\"Earth's shadow\\" in his doctoral thesis in the 1940s, and he hypothesized that this effect could also be attributed to Chappuis absorption. However, this conjecture is not supported by more recent measurements.  Physical basis  Chappuis absorption is a continuum absorption in the wavelength range between 400 and 650 nm. It is caused by the photodissociation (breaking-apart) of the ozone molecule. The absorption maximum lies around 603 nm, with a cross-section of 5.23 10‚àí21 cm2. A second, somewhat smaller maximum at ca. 575 nm has a cross-section of 4.83 10‚àí21 cm2. The absorbance energy in the Chappuis bands lies between 1.8 and 3.1 eV. The measured values imply that absorption mechanism is barely temperature- dependent; the deviation accounts for less than three percent. Around its maxima, Chappuis absorption is about three orders of magnitude weaker than the absorption of ultraviolet light in the range of the Hartley bands. Indeed, the Chappuis absorption is one of the few noteworthy absorption processes within the visible spectrum in Earth's atmosphere. Overlaid on the absorption spectrum of the Chappuis bands at shorter wavelengths are partly irregular and diffuse bands caused by molecular vibrations. The irregularity of these bands implies that the ozone molecule is only for an extremely short time in an excited state before it dissociates. During this short excitation it is mostly undergoing symmetrical stretching vibrations, although with some contributions from bending vibrations. A consistent theoretical explanation of the vibration structure that is in line with the experimental data was for a long time an unsolved problem; even today, not all details of the Chappuis absorption can be explained by theory. Like when it absorbs ultraviolet light, the ozone molecule can decompose into an O2 molecule and an O atom during Chappuis absorption. Unlike the Hartley and Huggins absorptions, however, the decomposition products do not remain in an excited state. Dissociation in the Chappuis bands is the most important photochemical process involving ozone in the Earth's atmosphere below an altitude of 30 km. Over this altitude, it is outweighed by absorptions in the Hartley band. However, neither the Hartley nor the Chappuis absorptions cause significant loss of ozone in the stratosphere, despite the high potential photodissociation rate, because the elemental oxygen has a high probability of encountering an O2 molecule and recombining back into ozone.

The frequent cases of rape against Kashmiri Muslim women by Indian state security forces regularly goes unpunished. they have also been victims of violence by the militants. Women's rights in Kashmir Valley has major issues as there is harassment of young muslim women participating in sports activities, demands of dowry after marriage, domestic violence incidents, acid attacks on women for not wearing hijab, usual Mansplaining Education J&K;'s social, economic and political conditions have increased gender disparity in the region, with men dominating its socio- economic and political processes. Women's roles have traditionally been domestic, and women in rural areas do not have access to education. According to a 2011 census, the literacy rate in J&K; was 68.74 per cent; literacy among women was 58.01 per cent. The female high-school dropout rate is higher than the male rate, and one out of every three adult women in J&K; is unable to read or write (compared with one out of five adult males). In many rural areas, the birth of a son is celebrated; the birth of a daughter is not. Males are seen as able to get a job and help support a family; females are seen as an expense, since they will marry and leave home. Article 10 of the United Nations General Assembly's Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women recognises that such gender inequality can be eliminated only by education. The government of Jammu and Kashmir, realising that gender disparity in education must be removed for women in the Kashmir Valley, has begun a number of initiatives. Qualified female teachers are underemployed, however; school infrastructure is poor, and student-teacher ratios are high. Citizenship According to the UN General Assembly's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the principle of citizenship operates on the assumption of equality between men and women. In Jammu and Kashmir, however, citizenship is unequal among men and women. If a woman from J&K; marries a foreigner, she loses her right to inherit, own or buy immovable property in the state; no such law affects a male in a similar situation. Secularists and ethnic nationalists believe that J&K; can survive amid globalization with its identity intact only by protecting Kashmiri culture, and Kashmiri women are discouraged from crossing the cultural threshold; inequality in citizenship is justified as preserving the state. On 7 October 2002, the Jammu and Kashmir High Court overturned the established legal position. The court ruled that by marrying an outsider, a J&K; woman did not lose her permanent-resident status. It was further stated that the original document that had been used as evidence for depriving women of their citizenship did not expressly state so. The decision was contested by the state's political parties, who drafted a bill known as the Daughters Bill or the Permanent Residents' (Disqualification) Bill stripping a woman of permanent resident-status if she married a foreigner. According to law minister Muzaffar Beg, it was \\"universally accepted that the woman follows the domicile of her husband.\\" Although the bill was not passed, a similar bill was introduced in March 2010 ostensibly to stave off demographic change; however, the rationale did not address the male role (through intermarriage) in demographic change. That bill was not passed, but it has considerable support. Role of women in the conflict In 1989, Kashmiri dissatisfaction with Indian rule led to the Kashmir conflict resulting in the abuse of women in the region According to a report by Human Rights Watch in 1993, the Indian security forces use rape as a method of retaliation against Kashmiri civilians during reprisal attacks after militant ambushes.Inger Skjelsb√¶k (2001) Sexual violence in times of war: A new challenge for peace operations?, International Peacekeeping, 8:2, 75-76.\\"Rape in Kashmir: A Crime of War\\" (PDF). Asia Watch & Physicians for Human Rights A Division of Human Rights Watch. 5 (9): 1.Littlewood, Roland. \\"Military Rape\\". Anthropology Today, vol. 13, no. 2, 1997, pp. 7‚Äì16. Professor William Baker states that rape in Kashmir was not the result of a few undisciplined soldiers but an active attempt by the Indian security forces to humiliate and intimidate the Kashmiri population. When public support of the militancy began to diminish, many militants turned to the political arena; however, the voices of women have not been accorded their rightful place in the dialogues of the Kashmiri conflict and politics. Although women have been the hardest-hit victims of the conflict and have played pivotal roles in separatism and the armed insurgency, their activities are barely mentioned in mainstream narratives of Kashmiri militancy. The media seems uneasy with the idea of female Kashmiri involvement in militancy; when a woman is charged as an overground operative of a militant group, the media swiftly declares her innocent or justifies her. Dukhtaran-e-Milat Dukhtaran-e-Millat (DeM) is a women's organisation which was founded in 1981 by Asiya Andrabi. The group's early goal was to educate Muslim women about Islam and make them aware of their rights. Over time, however, it began morally policing women and encouraged them to support militants waging jihad in Kashmir. The group has often had to go underground after the government prohibited its activities. In 1987, the organisation became more political and demanded seats reserved for women on public transport; the government ignored their demands. When the insurgency began in 1988, DeM appealed to women to run their households and support the mujahideen. According to Andrabi, she has stopped many young women from going to Pakistan for training in armed combat at militant camps. DeM's timeline is full of bans and arrests under the Public Safety Act. DeM can be classified as a radical religious group which uses coercion to impose a conservative version of Islam on Kashmiri women. Its moral-police initiatives primarily target what are considered centres of immorality, including cafes, restaurants and shops selling alcohol and gifts. DeM campaigns for sex segregation and strict gender role based on the five pillars of Islam. Viewing the Kashmir conflict as religious in nature, they seek the unification of J&K; with Pakistan. Although DeM has not been proven to engage in direct armed struggle, Andrabi said in an interview that the women might take up arms or become suicide bombers if needed. Organisations which share DeM's ideology promote a homogenous culture, without the liberties and choices for women which are traditionally an integral part of the Kashmiri culture. Their strict measures, such as imposition of the burqa, strengthen the patriarchal structure of Kashmiri society. According to some commentators, DeM's efforts would be more effective if directed at the creation of quotas for women in Parliament, the legislative assembly and the judiciary; female representation would increase, triggering a cultural shift in gender-role expectations.  Women's Self Defense Corps  In 1947, the volunteer Women's Self Defense Corps (WSDC) was founded as the female wing of the Jammu and Kashmir National Militia. The group's aim is \\"to train women for self- defense and to resist invaders\\". In addition to weapons training, the group also provided a forum where women \\"steeped in centuries-old traditions, abysmal ignorance, poverty and superstition could discuss their issues\\". The corps also worked at a political and cultural level for increased impact.  Cross-border collaboration  Cross-border collaborations can be traced back to the beginning of conflict between India and Pakistan. Women in both countries shared a number of issues, such as public and domestic violence, rape, human-rights abuses and inequality, and the environment created by the Kashmir conflict had a negative impact. Groups and initiatives fostering cross-border collaboration created a space for the women and an atmosphere for developing human relationships and substantive dialogue on issues like the Indo-Pakistani wars. Women's cross-border initiatives have changed and contributed to peace between India and Pakistan. It provides opportunities for face-to-face interactions and dialogue, and has facilitated much-needed understanding between the people of both countries. Women have participated in several processes through meetings with government officials and civil-society groups, addressed concerns such as education and visas, and initiated a media exchange between the countries. When only civil-society groups and government officials had the right to make decisions, groups and initiatives like this were negotiated and sustained cross-border dialogue. Women's experiences and groups are an alternative, nonviolent means of negotiating an end to conflict.  Women's Bus for Peace  In 1999, 40 Indian women of different religions and political views took a 12-hour bus trip from New Delhi to Lahore which was organized by the Women's Initiative for Peace in South Asia (WIPSA). The Women's Bus for Peace was one of many several cross-border collaborations by women from Pakistan and India. The initiative began with communication, since the women had common issues and struggles. What brought them together was the need to build strategies for peace. The Women's Bus for Peace focused on the need for communication between the people of Pakistan and India.  Line of Control conference  A November 2007 conference for Pakistani and Indian women, \\"Connecting Women across the Line of Control (LOC)\\", was held in Kashmir. Discussion topics at the conference ranged from aiding victims of violence and untreated illnesses to mobilizing women in the political and social arenas. The participants \\"vehemently endorsed diplomacy and peaceful negotiations in order to further the India‚ÄìPakistan peace process; withdrawal of forces from both sides of the LOC; decommissioning of militants; rehabilitation of Kashmiri Pandits to rebuild the syncretic fabric of Kashmiri society; and rehabilitation of detainees\\". Regardless of ethnicity, the women worked together to find solutions to problems caused by the Kashmir conflict and end the decades-long feud.

It is one of the most recently known elasmosaurids to have lived in North America. Unlike other elasmosaurids, it has a relatively short neck. Description In November 2010, hunter David Bradt stumbled on an elasmosaur fossil in a canyon on the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge. The specimen proved to be a new, short-necked species of elasmosaur, subsequently named Nakonanectes bradti. The type specimen, MOR 3072, was nearly complete. This included the skull, a part not often found intact in Elasmosauridae fossils. Other elements of the fossil included the anterior cervical vertebrae, partial dorsal and caudal vertebrae, incomplete fore and hind limbs, gastralia, partial pectoral and pelvic girdles, and ribs. The fossil was found in the Bearpaw Formation, a late Campanian/early Maastrichtian rock, making it one of the last known elasmosaurids to have lived in the Western Interior Seaway. N. bradti was only in length, making it one of the smallest elasmosaurids known. It also had a much shorter neck that most eleasmosaurids, with only 39 to 42 cervical vertebrae. Classification Danielle Serratos, Patrick Druckenmiller, and Roger Benson found that N. bradti is similar to the Aristonectinae, short- necked elasmosaurids known from fossils collected in South America.

Family  He came from the family of the Bedirxans, who for centuries, as autonomous vassals of the Ottomans, ruled the Principality of Bohtan with the capital Cizre . His grandfather Bedirxan Beg had rebelled against the Ottomans at the end of the 19th century and was deported to Istanbul after his defeat and family. Kamuran's father Emin Ali Bedirxan was politically active in the Kurdish movement and was the founder of the Kurdistan Teali Cemiyeti, in which Kamuran was also a member. His brother Celadet Ali Bedirxan was also politically active and the creator of the Latin Kurmanji alphabet. Kamuran had been married to the Polish princess Nathalie d'Ossovetzky (who died in 1975) since 1954. d'Ossovetzky, who has been his student and later also secretary, was supportive of his writing. The couple had no children.  Education  Kamuran attended the French Galatasaray High School in Istanbul. Between 1905 and 1908 his family had to leave the city because of a murder at the Istanbul prefects and lived in Isparta and Beirut . He later studied law at Istanbul University and worked as a lawyer.  Political career  In 1918, he became a member of the Society for the Elevation of Kurdistan (Kurdistan Teali Cemiyeti), like others from his family. In 1919, Kamuran and his brother Celadet Bedirxan accompanied British officer Edward Noel in his travels through Iraq. Noel was assessing the possibility of the creation of an official nation of Kurdistan. Bedirxan was an opponent of Atat√ºrk's independence movement and was ordered by the British government in Istanbul to go to a planned congress in 1919 in Sivas and arrest Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk. He set off with several men, including his brother, the governor of Harput and the British officer Edward Noel, but the project failed. Kamuran was an opponent of Kemalism and when the Republic of Turkey was proclaimed in 1923, he had already left the country to Germany. He lived with his relatives in Munich where he studied law at the Ludwig Maximilians Universit√§t and after followed up on his studies at the University of Leipzig from which he also graduated.Henning, Barbara (2018), p.370 In 1927 he settled to Syria and worked as a lawyer in Beirut. He also joined the organization Xoyb√ªn and helped his brother with the publication of the Kurdish newspaper Hawar. In the thirties he stayed in Berlin and met the Iranian Karl Hadank. He conducted a radio program in Kurdish language at the Radio Levant in Beirut from 1942 onwards until 1946.Henning, Barbara (2018), p.583 In 1944 Kamuran contributed to the establishment of the network Trava, which focus was on the development of the businesses.Henning, Barbara (2018), p.586 Between 1943 and 1946 Kamuran also published the Kurdish and French-language magazine Roja N√ª (en: New Day) in Beirut. The following years he lived in Germany and France. After Syria became independent in 1946, he lost his work at the Radio Levant and he couldn't find a way to have influence in the local politics. Therefore, he moved to Paris where he became a lecturer at the Institut national des langues et civilizations orientales (INALCO) in 1948. From 1960 he became the European spokesman for the Iraqi Kurds led by Mustafa Barzani. He established important contacts between the Kurds and Israel. Israel saw the Kurds as a suitable means of weakening Iraq militarily and tying up the Iraqi army in northern Iraq. In 1962, he met Ihsan Nuri in West Berlin. In 1970 he retired. Kamuran died in 1978. He was posthumously appointed the co-founder of the Kurdish Institute of Paris. His works are kept in the Institute.  Selected works  *Dil√™ qur√™n min.

The only species, Lagenanectes richterae, was first described in 2017, and is regarded as one of the best-preserved plesiosaur fossils from this geological age in Europe. Lagenanectes is one of the earliest elasmosaurids. The holotype is an incomplete skeleton, comprising large parts of the skull, some neck and tail vertebrae as well as ribs and part of the limbs. A length of about 8 meters (26 feet) has been estimated.  Discovery and naming  Diagram showing most of the preserved elements attributed to Lagenanectes richterae; Annette Richter, for whom the species is named, is shown for scale The well-preserved holotype specimen of Lagenanectes richterae (specimen number BGR Ma 13328) was found in the disused Moorberg clay pit near Sarstedt by private collectors in 1964. The exact horizon is unknown (the age of the fossils might be lower Hauterivian to lower Barremian, but most probably is upper Hauterivian). The fossils were later given to the Geological Survey at Hannover ,where Professor Sickenberg identified them as elasmosaurid remains. They have subsequently been transferred to the Lower Saxony State Museum in Hannover, where part of the specimen is now on display. However, it was not until some 50 years later, in 2017, that Sven Sachs, Jahn J. Hornung and Benjamin P. Kear studied the fossil in detail and erected Lagenanectes as a new, monotypic genus. The name Lagenanectes literally means \\"Leine swimmer\\" and refers to both, the Leine river which passes Sarstedt, and to the swimming life style of this marine reptile. The species name richterae honours Annette Richter, chief curator of the Natural History department at the Lower Saxony State Museum in Hannover, for her contributions to the palaeontological exploration of Lower Saxony.  Description  The holotype of Lagenanectes richterae was a fully grown individual. This is indicated by the ossification of both the cranial bones and the vertebrae and neural arches. The front part of the lower jaw of Lagenanectes richterae shows some anatomical features which are unique in plesiosaurs (autapomorphies): The alveols are placed sidewards and a platform is present on the underside of the lower jaw that bears prominent dents. The skull of Lagenanectes shows a rounded snout that is accompanied by some grooves on the upper side. These grooves may have accommodated electroreceptors to locate the prey. The neck vertebrae of Lagenanectes are square-shaped and lack a notch on the lower side of the articular surfaces of the vertebral centra, which is characteristic for other elasmosaurs.  Classification  The study by Sachs and colleagues demonstrated that Lagenanectes richterae was an early member of the elasmosaurids. Following their cladistic analysis, Lagenanectes was most closely related to the \\"Speeton Clay plesiosaur\\" (a yet undescribed plesiosaur from the Hauterivian of England, and to Callawayasaurus from the Aptian of Colombia.  Pathologies  The occiput and the first neck vertebra of the holotype of Lagenanectes richterae show pathological alterations of the bony structure. They may have been caused by an infection.

Alamillo and D. Bartels, 2001, Plant Sci 160, 1161-1170) and polyamine metabolic canalization of drought stress (R. Alcazar, M. Bitrian, D. Bartels et al. 2011, Plant Sig. Behav. 6:243-250).Shri Mohan Jain and S. Dutta Gupta (Editors) It was found in 2000, that the capacity to accumulate large amounts of sucrose in the vegetative tissues helps the plant survive. In 2011, a study found that Putrescine (an organic chemical compound) to spermine (an organic chemical compound) canalization has also been found in C. plantagineum, which conversely to Arabidopsis, accumulates high spermine levels which associate with drought tolerance. Taxonomy Seen in Borakalalo Game Reserve, South Africa It was once the english common name of Rhodesian Violet, recently it has been called the Kenya violet. It is also called 'blue carpet',Yuki Nakamura and Yonghua Li-Beisson (Editors) or 'false violet', and occasionally as 'mole's spectacles'. but this last one is normally the common name for Craterostigma wilmsii or Craterostigma nanum. It is also commonly called the 'resurrection plant' in science.Theodore T. Kozlowski, Stephen G. Pallardy In Zimbabwe, it has 2 common names, in Tonga language, it is known as 'mubatabata', and in Ndebele language it is 'umabuyasibonze'. The Latin specific epithet plantagineum refers to the leaves of the plant which are similar to those of a plantain. W. T. Parsons, William Thomas Parsons and E. G. Cuthbertson It was first described and published by German (botanist and Protestant minister) Christian Ferdinand Friedrich Hochstetter, in 'Flora' Vol.24 on page 669 in 1841. The species and genus was described by Hochstetter also in 1841; the name 'Craterostigma', may refer to the hollow between the two lips of the stigma. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 12 April 2016. Distribution and habitat Craterostigma plantagineum is native to some tropical parts of Africa and Temperate Asia. Range It is found within Africa in Chad, Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan (including Didinga mountains in south Sudan,), Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Niger, Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia and South Africa.Ib Friis and Kaj Vollesen Within Asia, it is found in India and also on the Arabian peninsula in Yemen. Habitat It is found growing in shallow soils over rock, on the edge of murram (dirt roads), or on poor pasture lands, and in wooded grasslands. It grows in lowlands, at altitudes of above sea level. Cultivation It is used in gardens within East Africa.Arthur John Jex-Blake Uses It has been medically used in folk medicine in Botswana, an infusion of the roots was taken for the treatment of abdominal pains. Also an ointment was applied to the face as a lucky charm. References Other sources * Chapano, C. & Mugarisanwa, N.H. (2003).

The Thanatos Painter (5th century BCE) was an Athenian Ancient Greek vase painter who painted scenes of death on white- ground cylindrical lekythoi. All of the Thanatos Painter's found lekythoi have scenes of or related to death (thanatos in Greek) on them, including the eponymous god of death Thanatos carrying away dead bodies.  Lekythoi   Women mourning Lekythos  One example of a white-ground lekythos by the Thanatos Painter is a vase in the Art Walters Museum (440‚Äì430 BCE). The women is mourning over a deceased family member. There is a male figure approaching from the right side of the lekythos that is unseen by the women. He is a representation of the deceased family member. The Greeks believed that the deceased lingered over their grave after death. The deceased man is the main focus of the painting due to the red color of his clothes. Since this is a lekythos from his grave he is the main focus as a reminder to mourn his death. The women is also bent over which leads the eye to the grave stele and finally to the man, making him even more of the main focus. The grave has ribbon or rope that swoops back and forth which pulls the eye back and forth between the two figures.  Hypnos and Thanatos Lekythos  Hypnos and Thanatos carrying body of Sarpedon from the battlefield of Troy. Another example of a white- ground lekythos by the Thanatos Painter is of Hynos and Thanatos carrying Sarpedon (435‚Äì425 BCE); it is located in the British Museum. On the lekythos Hypnos, the Greek of sleep, and Thanatos, the Greek god of death, are carrying Sarpedon who was Zeus' son. Sarpedon was one of Zeus' favorite sons and he entrusted Hynos and Thanatos to deliver Sarpedon's body to where he would be buried in Lycia. Sleep is near Sarpedon's head and Death is near his feet. Sleep is almost cradling Sarpedon‚Äôs head and it is laid on top Sleep‚Äôs heart. This could be symbolic of the fact that Zeus holds Sarpedon near. The grave stele is in an area to help there from being a giant blank area. If it was not where it is, there would be a huge gap between the head of Death and the other two figures heads. The stele allows for continuity throughout the painting. The eyes in this painting are all looking at different subjects. Sleep and Death are looking at Sarpedon, almost like they are being careful with that they are doing. The helmet on the grave stele is looking at Sleep, or just over his head. This could be the helmet looking into the future or raising its ‚Äòeyes‚Äô to the heavens. Sarpedon‚Äôs eyes are half open and looking out at the viewer. This image is present on many other forms of pottery, and especially connected to the funerary context.  Lekythoi in funerary context  White- ground lekythoi are used specifically in the funeral context and were sometimes used to replace grave stele. Lekythoi were used to hold funerary oil, typically olive oil. Most were hollow except for the very top 'cup' which would hold the oil, so the lekythoi would always looks full. This oil was used to wash the deceases body, and then the body would be wrapped in clean cloth. This would help prepare the body for the afterlife. Lekythoi had different scenes on them that depicted death, such as: inhumation, procession, and visitations to graves. They had vibrantly painted, detailed scenes of death as the main focal point of the pottery. Marble lekythoi could be used as grave markers and had relief sculpture that was painted, instead of just painting like terracotta lekythoi had. Some marble lekythoi were used as a grave marker for a family plot, instead of for a single person. They were also a symbol of status as any elaborate grave marker would have been at this time.

Nicknamed \\"Spanner\\" by his teammates, he was mostly known for his goalscoring adroitness back in Zimbabwe. The Gweru local sees Zimbabwean former footballer Peter Ndlovu as his main inspiration. Early life Born in Gweru, the former Takunda Primary and Mkoba 3 High School student was raised solely by his mother Georgina Kunene after the passing of his father in his early childhood. Career Youth Aged 17, the national team player also represented Midlands Province in the Zimbabwe National Youth Games where he was spotted by Tsholotsho F.C. coach Lizwe Sweswe who identified him as someone he could build his team around. Lizwe ended up buying Chirmabadare in 2013. Zimbabwe The winger joined Zimbabwean lower-league side Zim Alloys in 2011 but was overlooked by the coach which chagrined him deeply. Begrudgingly, Chirmabadare opted to work as a barman for six months in his hometown of Gweru before proceeding to move to Gweru Pirates on a loan spell. Not long after, he was sold to Silo United before sealing a move to Tsholtsho F.C. of the Zimbabwe Division 1 where he scored 13 goals,(in his second year following a stint at Highlands F.C.) earning them automatic promotion. Owing to his form, Chicken Inn coach Joey Antipas decided to scout him in a match facing Black boots F.C. where he scored a brace. Because of his performance there, he was bought by Chicken Inn F.C. in 2015 and delivered 11 goals in his first season there, scoring three goals in his first five games and netting the fastest goal of the season on his debut in a 2-1 victory over Flame Lilly FC. As a result, he became the most sought-for player in the Zimbabwe Premier Soccer League at the time. Kaizer Chiefs Following a trial with the Soweto- based club, Chirambadare signed a three-year contract with the Amakhosi along with Zimbabwean Michelle Katsvairo in 2016, authoring his first goal in the quarter-final of the 2016 Telkom Knockout where Kaizer Chiefs lost on penalties to Free State Stars. Although Chirambadare did not manage a league goal in his first seventeen appearances at Kaizer Chiefs, he adapted well to the club and cemented his place as a regular starter in the lineup and won the 2016-17 Kaizer Chiefs Most Improved Player award. Back in 2016, the offensive player trialed for Bidvest Wits but he never made the transfer. Personal life While plying his trade for Chicken Inn, the Zimbabwean playmaker shared a house with teammate David Tenwanjira. A devout Christian, he was raised on the Masowe Echishanu Apostolic Church before moving on to the Methodist Church. His interests include pool, darts and chess. His late father Peter and his cousins Stanley, Ernest, and Shepherd were all footballers.

Regius Professor of Moral and Pastoral Theology at the University of Oxford since 2007, he is a member of faculty at Christ Church, Oxford, and he is additionally canon of Christ Church Cathedral. Early life Nigel Biggar was born in March 1955 and educated at Monkton Combe School, near Bath, Somerset. After reading Modern History at Worcester College, Oxford, Biggar studied religion, theology and ethics at Regent College in Vancouver and the University of Chicago. Career On his return to Oxford in 1985, he became Librarian and Research Fellow at Latimer House, and then for most of the 1990s, he was Chaplain and Fellow of Oriel College. In 1999, he took the Chair of Theology at the University of Leeds, and in 2004 he moved to the Chair of Theology and Ethics at Trinity College, Dublin. Colonialism Biggar is the leader of a five-year project at Oxford University entitled \\"Ethics and Empire\\". In 2017, Biggar addressed the ethics of colonialism in an op-ed for The Times. Writing about the work of Bruce Gilley, a political scientist at Portland State University in the United States, he defended Gilley's \\"courageous call for a balanced reappraisal of the colonial past\\" and called for the recognition \\"that the history of the British Empire was morally mixed\\". Cambridge University's Reader of Post-colonial Literature Priyamvada Gopal said his article contained opinions which amount to \\"outright racist imperial apologetics\\". One of Biggar's Oxford colleagues, James McDougall wrote an open letter disagreeing with Biggar signed by around 170 international academics. Trevor Phillips, the former chairman of the Equalities Commission, defended Biggar against his critics in a letter to The Times: \\"Students‚Äô misreading of history is entirely understandable if they are instructed by the academics who criticise Nigel Biggar for asking ‚Äòthe wrong questions, using the wrong terms'\\".
