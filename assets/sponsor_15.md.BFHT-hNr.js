The school teaches approximately sixty students in prekindergarten through grade 12. History Clear Spring School was founded in 1974 by Will and Laurie Fulton and Molly Fulton Seeligson. Will and Molly‚Äôs father, Dr. Bernard Fulton, had previously founded the Greenhill School in Dallas, Texas. The vision of Clear Spring School, following the founders‚Äô philosophy of true education, was to promote a lifelong love of learning. They recognized that when students make a personal and meaningful connection with a subject, then knowledge, skill, and growth naturally follow. Beginning as a one-room school for students in grades 1 ‚Äì 6, Clear Spring School gradually expanded to serve pre-primary students and later added a middle school and then high school program. Over the school‚Äôs early years, it was housed in four different donated spaces as the program grew, including Eureka Springs‚Äô historic ‚ÄúOld Red Brick School House‚Äù (later destroyed by fire in 1990). With the school‚Äôs growth came the acquisition of 16 wooded acres, and a master plan that resulted in the construction of five buildings housing classrooms and administrative offices. Clear Spring School has been nationally accredited through the Independent School Association of the Central States (ISACS) since 1999. In addition to ISACS accreditation, CSS is also a member of the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS). Clear Spring School is divided into the following programs: * Pre-Primary Program‚Äîprekindergarten (PK) and kindergarten (KG) * E≈Çementary School‚Äîtwo classrooms divided into grades 1‚Äì3 and grades 4‚Äì5. * Middle School‚Äîgrades 6 through 8 on a block schedule. * High School‚Äîgrades 9 through 12 on a block schedule.

It was not an actual declaration of war. The message was later interpreted by the Dutch as a declaration of war; however from the German side it was at the time seen as a mere warning, hopefully intimidating the Dutch enough to accept German military protection. At the time of delivery, the German troops had already transgressed the Dutch border. The delivery In the early hours of 10 May the German minister of foreign affairs Joachim von Ribbentrop ordered the German envoy in the Netherlands, Count Julius von Zech-Burkersroda, who had been living in the Netherlands for many years representing the German government, to deliver a message to the Dutch government. Around 04:00 local time the Dutch minister of foreign affairs Eelco van Kleffens was recalled from the Dutch war council to his department in order to receive the message. It was not easy for Van Kleffens to reach the building as The Hague was already under attack by German paratroopers and nervous Dutch soldiers manning checkpoints suspected anyone to be a fifth columnist. He was even arrested and released only on orders of the General Headquarters. On arrival Van Kleffens received the envoy around 6:00 in his office, who entered, guarded by two Dutch officers, in tears. He had with him a transcription in German of the telegram. He should have reformulated it, but had been unable to, apparently having been overcome by his emotions, feeling deeply ashamed of the actions by his fellow countrymen. When facing Van Kleffens he was unable to speak but merely cried; after a while Van Kleffens asked him to hand over the paper so that he could read it himself. It was directly apparent to Van Kleffens that the message entailed an offer to become a German protectorate (like Denmark had done a month earlier) under threat of complete annihilation of the Dutch state if the Dutch would refuse to comply. It would have to be made clear immediately that the Netherlands intended to continue the fight together with their allies; however, by the Dutch Constitution for a Dutch declaration of war, consent was needed of the States-General of the Netherlands. Therefore, he chose to answer that the Dutch government considered the Kingdom of the Netherlands to be already in a state of war with Germany as a result of the German military action. He answered by writing a reply with a blue aniline pencil on a small paper. Many Dutch sources treat the telegram text as if it were a German declaration of war and change the typical style into standard sentences.

Geography Cesana Torinese covers 12,130 haCity Charter of Cesana Torinese; article 3 (Statuto comunale: Art. 3; Territorio e sede comunale ) and is bordered by the comune of Oulx on the north, France on the south, the comunes of Sauze di Cesana and Sestriere on the east, and the comune of Claviere and France on the west. History The church of Madonna della Neve Cesana Torinese is sited on the route of the Roman road leading from the Po Valley to Gaul. During the Middle Ages the road lost its commercial importance but retained its military significance. Cesana was controlled by the counts of Albon and dauphins of Viennois until the second half of the 14th century, when he ceded the lands and title to France. In 1155 Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor authorised the dauphin Guigues V of Albon to mint silver coins in Cesana - from 1281 the coins bore the dauphins' symbol of a dolphin, which was also shown in all local coats of arms. In 1343, with the dauphins' concession, the Escarton Republic was born, on lands now divided between France and Italy. Cesana thus found itself in Escarton d'Oulx until 1713, when it was ceded to the Kingdom of Savoy by the Treaty of Utrecht. Between the 14th and 17th centuries the Cesana valley was damaged directly and indirectly by the wars of religion, mainly fought against the \\"Waldensian heretics\\" in the Valle Chisone. During the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714) the territory was attacked and conquered by French troops. In the 18th century Cesana's strategic importance declined until an era when new roads were constructed and the town once again benefited from commercial traffic. In 1928 some previously independent towns (D√©s√®rtes, Bousson, Fenils, Molli√®res, Solomiac and Thures) were merged with that of Cesana. Cesana was one of the venues for the 2006 Winter Olympics, hosting the biathlon, women's alpine skiing, bobsleigh, luge and skeleton. It also hosted the biathlon for the 2007 Winter Universiade.

Ciri√© borders the following municipalities: Nole, San Carlo Canavese, San Maurizio Canavese and Robassomero. Geography Ciri√©, about 13 miles northwest of Turin, is located at the end of the Lanzo valleys, close to a plateau called \\"Vauda\\", a Celtic origin term indicating a forest. The area is close to the Stura di Lanzo, a creek which flows west northwest of the city. History The area around Ciri√©, since about the third century BC, had Salassi, a Celtic tribe settlement. Before the Roman rule, according to Polybius, this area was covered in thick forests, with very few glades, some small villages and sparse tracks linking the settlements. In 143 BC, the Romans, led by consul Appius Claudius Pulcher (consul 143 BC), moved against the tribes living Orco and Dora Baltea valleys, to open a way towards Elvetia and Gaul. The Romans thought of a fast victory, but the Celtic tribes fought back with such a strength that the legions had initially to retreat. For this reason, the Romans set up several camps, for a better control of roads and adjacent areas. Castra were set up in the current neighbors of Ivrea, Turin and Ciri√©, where the soldiers could easily control access to the Lanzo valleys. The castrum stativum (permanent camp) in the Ciri√© area was called Castra Cerreti, deriving this name from the turkish oak (Quercus Cerri), an oak tree whose forests were abundant in the neighbors. In later years, it became known as Cerretum for short. The cardo maximus (or via principalis), of the ancient castrum roughly coincides with via Vittorio Emanuele II, the current main street. After the complete defeat of the Salassi and the peace treaties, the castrum rapidly became a main business crossroads and several houses, initially wooden then in bricks and stones, were built around the military camp. When the Christianity expanded in the Roman Empire, Ciri√© picked up Cyriacus (martyrized in Rome in 303) as patron saint, due to the similarity of his name with the ancient castrum denomination. The famous Il celebre Theatrum Statuum Sabaudiae (1682, a sort of guide of the Savoy territories) gives a long and detailed description of Ciri√© (\\"Septimo Taurinense ad Urbe lapide, Septentrionem versus, non longe ab Alpium Graiarum radicibus, occurrit Ciriacum Oppidum, insigne Marchionatus titulo, qui sub se S.Mauritium, Nolas & Robasomerium minora Oppida comprehendit\\") and cites the probable origin of the village name as being related to the martyr (\\"Pedemontanis dicitur Ciri√©, fortasse a peculiari Incolarum erga Divum Cyriacum Martyrem cultu, cujus festum s.Idus Augusti inibi summa celebritate recolitur\\"). Roman presence in Ciri√© is testified by several Roman coins, shards of vases and funerary stele (preserved in the San Martino church). From the Fall of Roman Empire and the barbaric invasions, we don't have further information on Ciri√© for almost a millennium. The first historical fact known is the occupation of Ciri√©'s area by the Marquis of Montferrat in 1229. In 1296 Marguerite of Savoy marries John I, Marquess of Montferrat, getting ruling rights over the territories of Caselle, Ciri√© and Lanzo. When her husband dies prematurely, Marguerite moves into the great Castle of Ciri√©, a big fortress standing where nowadays is the piazza Castello. The coming of Marguerite to Ciri√© (1306), is celebrated with the Palio dei Borghi, a medieval festival held every two years with tournaments and games. Marguerite began great works in the castle, which became rapidly one of the most renowned mansions of the area, with nobles visiting from all over Europe. The many servants coming along with the nobles were hosted by the citizens of Ciri√© and Marguerite issued \\"patenti\\", important acknowledgments of their service to the Marquess. Marguerite also cut taxes and commanded a weekly market to be held each Friday, a commercial venue which attracted many people and business from the neighbors. This market is still held these days. The castle was destroyed during the French invasion of 1536 and the few remains were completely scattered about 1900 when the square was \\"modernized\\". Some friezes, the only remains of the once powerful castle, are now preserved in the San Martino church. In 1576 the Savoy family exchanges the Ciri√© area with an access to the sea with the Doria Marquis of Genoa: Gian Gerolamo D'Oria establishes his residence in Ciri√©, starting the long dynasty (the D'Oria e del Maro di Ciri√©) which ruled the city till the last Marquis Emanuele D'Oria, who becomes the first mayor when Ciri√©, in force of a royal decree, is established a \\"city\\" in 1905. Main sights *San Giovanni Battista (known as the Duomo although it is not a cathedral church), dates from the 14th century, but the place has been dedicated to worship since the Romans settled in the area. Most probably a temple of the goddess Diana was erected in this very place. A series of Christian churches were then established on the site of the former temple. The current church, in a bright Piedmontese Gothic architecture, has three naves. It has been heavily restored in the late 1800s with some arguable Byzantine flavor by Edoardo Arborio Mella and the facade has been used a model for the church in the Borgo Medievale (Medieval village), a replica of medieval mountain castles of Piedmont and Aosta Valley, built in Turin for the International Exhibition of 1884. for the International Exhibition of 1884. The church has a four-floor bell tower with mullioned windows. The interior houses a Madonna del Popolo from Defendente Ferrari's workshop, a wonderful Byzantine-school crucifix (12th-13th centuries) and a triptych by Giuseppe Giovenone da Vercelli (1531) so beautiful that it is said king Carlo Alberto offered 4000 lire to have it in the royal art collection Sabauda Gallery, but the people of Ciri√© refused. *Palazzo dei Marchesi D'Oria, built in the 17th century over a pre-existing building of the Provana family dating back to the 16th century. The restored palace had a vast park behind it, with a small lake and a tower where the ice formed on the lake in winter was cut and stored to be used during the hottest months. When the D'Oria family was extinguished in the male line (beginning of 1900), the palace and the park were acquired by the healthy Remmert family. The palace became the seat of the city government (\\"municipio\\") while the park became a residential area (still known as the \\"Parco\\"). The House of Savoy had an apartment reserved inside the palace, when the king and his entourage came to Ciri√© for their hunting sessions. *Church of San Giuseppe was built as a votive offering during the 1630‚àí31 plague. The church is in a delicate piedmontese Baroque architecture and has a beautiful altarpiece attributed to Defendente Ferrari. *Chiesa di San Martino (di Liramo), the oldest church of Ciri√©, in a Romanesque style, was probably built in the early 10th century. Several times restored, it now has two small naves with semi-circular apses and a massive seven floor bell tower with mullioned windows. Most of the church is built with river stones and bricks. There are several partly remaining frescoes of different times. One remarkable part of Adam and Eve after the original sin on the arch of the major apse is partly covered by remains of a scene from a probable Last Judgement. A badly damaged Romanesque Christ Pantocrator is on the major apse. In the southern nave, there are some remains of frescoes devoted to the Virgin Mary as well as a Saint Martin of Tours, whom the church is dedicated, probably dating around 14th century. The church also preserves some Roman tombstones. References *Sismonda, Angelo Notizie storiche di Ciri√©, 1924, re-printed by a Bottega d'Erasmo, 1972 (Italian only).

The term livery is closely related to if not synonymous with delivery used in some jurisdictions in contract law or the related law of deeds. The oldest forms of common law provided that a valid conveyance of a feudal tenure in land required physical transfer by the transferor to the transferee in the presence of witnesses of a piece of the ground itself, in the literal sense of a hand-to-hand passing of an amount of soil, a twig, key to a building on that land, or other token. Varieties Livery of seisin could refer to either: * Livery in deed, whereby the parties met together on the land and the transferor symbolically delivered possession of the land by handing over a twig or a clump of earth to the recipient. * Livery in law, whereby the parties went within sight of the land and the transferor declared to the recipient that possession was being given, followed by the recipient entering onto the land. The symbol of livery for a house was the door's ring or hasp; for mills, the \\"clap and hopper\\"; for a church, a psalm book and keys, and so on. Legend According to Widukind of Corvey, a Saxon in Thuringia was approached by a local who asked to buy the Saxon's torc and bracelets. The local offered him a pile of dirt in exchange for the ornaments, which the Saxon eagerly accepted. The Thuringians thought they had made a good deal until the Saxons claimed the entire country on the basis that the dirt had been a livery of seisin, and made their legal claim good by force of arms. Turf and twig ceremony Delaware historical marker commemorating William Penn taking possession of his American property with the turf and twig ceremony The turf and twig ceremony dates from the feudal era but was used regularly in early colonial America allowing the English and Scottish (after 1707 termed the British) by virtue of their monarch's claims to take sovereign possession over unclaimed lands. The process has taken several forms over the centuries. Bernulf Hodge in A History of Malmesbury describes the process in at least Wiltshire, discontinued in the late 17th century, as follows:http://davidforward.net/menus/history/a-history-of-malmesbury/#twig > \\"The lucky new Commoner goes to his \\"given\\" acre and cuts a turf from the > selected site and drops two shillings in the hole made. The High Steward [of > the County] then twitches him with a twig and sticks the twig in the turf, > then hands it to him saying, \\"This turf and twig I give to thee, as free as > Athelstan gave to me, and I hope a loving brother thou wilt be.\\" The High > Steward then takes the money out of the hole and the new landowner replaces > the turf.\\" Inquisitions post mortem and livery of seisin Under the feudal system all land belonged to the monarch and was therefore either held by him directly (the royal demesne) or on his behalf, directly or indirectly.http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your- research/research-guides/inquisitions-post-mortem/ \\"Why were inquisitions post mortem held?\\" Inquisitions post mortem: land ownership and inheritance in the medieval and early modern periods, The National Archives, access date 2017-09-22. Those who held land directly on the king‚Äôs behalf were known as tenants in chief. When a tenant in chief died without an heir his lands \\"escheated\\" to (fell into the hands of) the king. If there was an heir, the king kept the lands until a livery of seisin took place: the heir paid a sum of money, a \\"relief\\", to take lawfully, \\"assume possession\\" of the land. If the heir was under age the king kept the lands until he or she came of age (at 21 for men or 14 for women) and the king received rights of wardship and marriage, collecting the revenues of the estate and disposing of the heir in marriage. He was able to sell these rights to third parties, who were not necessarily the ward's next of kin. These feudal tenures and rights were abolished in the Interregnum, reintroduced and then abolished in the following period of government, the reign of Charles II (1660‚Äì1685). Continuing ecclesiastical use A vestige of the procedure survives in the act by which a candidate is admitted to the office of incumbent in the Church of England. Canon C11 provides: * The bishop, after giving institution to any priest, shall issue directions for induction to the archdeacon or other the person to whom induction belongs, who shall thereupon induct the said priest into possession of the temporalities of the benefice. ** The archdeacon or other such person, when he makes the induction, shall take the priest who is to be inducted by the hand and lay it upon the key or upon the ring of the church door, or if the key cannot be had and there is no ring on the door, or if the church be in ruins, upon any part of the wall of the church or churchyard, at the same time reading the words of induction; after which the priest who has been inducted shall toll the bell to make his induction public and known to the people.

It is located close to the historic town of Axbridge. Along with the village of Cross and the hamlets of Rackley and Webbington it forms the parish of Compton Bishop and Cross.  History  It was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Comtone. It was the property of Giso, Bishop of Wells. The parish was part of the Winterstoke Hundred. The current manor house is a Grade II listed building and was built in the early 17th century. The parish includes the hamlet of Rackley which was a trading port on the River Axe in the Middle Ages following construction of a wharf in 1200. It now north of the River Axe as the course has been diverted, but on the Cheddar Yeo near the confluence. In 1324 Edward II confirmed it as a borough; however, by the end of the 14th century the port was in decline. In the 14th century a French ship sailed up the river and by 1388 Thomas Tanner from Wells used Rackley to export cloth and corn to Portugal, and received iron and salt in exchange. Later slate was imported through this route and it may have still be possible to trade through Rackley until the act of 1915 authorising the drainage of the Axe and installation of the flood gate at Bleadon. Also within the parish is the small village of Cross, where Wavering Down House was, for the last 20 years of his life, the home of the British comedian Frankie Howerd. The house is now a tourist attraction, and in the summer hosts concerts and opens regularly as a museum of Howerd's collection of memorabilia to raise fund for charities. The name Webbington is believed to mean 'The weaving enclosure' from the Old English webbian and tun. Webbington is popular with hikers as it has many good footpaths leading up to Crook Peak and Shute Shelve, at the western edge of the Mendip Hills, and is part of the Wessex walk route leading from Weston-super-Mare to Wells. The Webbington Hotel dominates the hamlet and is the only commercial building in the immediate area.  Governance  The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Sedgemoor, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Axbridge Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Wells county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected six MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.  Religious sites  Compton Bishop Church The Church of England parish church of St Andrew dates from the 13th century, being consecrated by Bishop Jocelin in 1236, with more recent restoration. It has a 15th-century pulpit with tracery panels, carved friezes and cresting. Above the pulpit is a large pedimented wall monument to John Prowse who died in 1688, as well as several of his children. It is a Grade I listed building. The churchyard cross is grade II listed, as are two chest tombs in the churchyard.

He holds the Wood Badge is a member of the Order of C√∫ Chulainn. As the first Chief Scout of the association, his term of office has been both ground-breaking and controversial. Burbridge had previously been the National Treasurer of Scouting Ireland (CSI) and one of the steering forces behind the formation of Scouting Ireland. Once the wheels had been set in motion in May 2003, Burbridge's appointment was seen by many Scouters as a fait accompli, with neither Peter Dixon nor Donald Harvey (the outgoing Chief Scouts of Scouting Ireland (CSI) and Scouting Ireland S.A.I. respectively) seeking nomination. He became Chief of the Interim National Management Committee, a new leader for a new era in Irish Scouting, and at the first National Council in The Helix in 2004 his position at the helm was confirmed. Initiatives during his term included the adoption of a new uniform, an entirely new administrative structure and a programme review. Apart from minor teething problems with the uniform, its adoption has been a success. The new Province and County structure and the administrative reshuffle have also been efficient, and welcomed by grassroots members. All other issues, however, were overshadowed by the debate on the possible implications of the programme review and proposed changes to the age ranges for sections. A new youth programme was adopted at National Council in Ballinasloe in June 2008. The successes of his time in office include the smooth transition from two strong associations to one, operating in 32 counties and catering for almost 40,000 members, successful advertising campaigns which have raised the profile of Scouting nationwide and have increased youth membership and a strong belief in youth participation. Among the early criticisms of his term was a lack of communication relating to the Castle Saunderson project, which has now been resolved, and the satisfactory resolution will most likely be his abiding legacy as Chief. Difficulties with funding for camp sites, the neglect of camping as a whole, and a drop in adult membership have been cited by members as key issues during his first term. He was re-elected unopposed in June 2007 and was expected to serve a second and final term of 3 years until 2010. However, Mr. Burbridge announced his decision to resign from the position of Chief Scout in a letter to the National Management Committee of Scouting Ireland dated 12 August 2008. In the letter the Chief Scout expresses his intention to resign from his position, effective from \\"12.00 midnight on Sunday 28 September 2008\\". Michael John Shinnick 2008-2015 Due to the resignation of Martin Burbridge the National Management Committee appointed Michael John Shinnick, the then Chief Commissioner for Adult Resources, as Scouting Ireland's second Chief Scout in September 2008. He was elected by National Council in March 2009 and re-elected in 2012 for a term to end in 2015. Christy McCann 2015 - Present =Annual meeting April 2015= An election for Chief Scout was scheduled for National Council on 18 April. There were two candidates nominated, Se√°n Farrell, National Secretary and former Ordinary Member of the National Management Committee (NMC), and Kiernan Gildea, former Chief Commissioner (Youth Programme) and Interim Dublin Metropolitan Provincial Commissioner. Gildea withdrew from the race on 17 April, and a yes/no referendum on Farrell was lost. The NMC scheduled an Emergency National Council for September 2015 to elect a successor. =Extraordinary meeting September 2015= International Commissioner and former North Eastern Provincial Commissioner, Christy McCann, was elected as Scouting Ireland's third Chief Scout in September 2015 for a term to end in 2018. Four candidates in total took part in the election. Se√°n Farrell was again nominated along with McCann and two former ordinary members of the National Management Committee Ollie Kehoe and Pat O'Connor. Voting was by single transferable vote. McCann was elected unopposed for a second term in April 2018. The National Management Committee brought restructuring proposals to National Council in 2018. As part of these plans, each individual on the NMC agreed to resign as a director, effective 31 October, so as to allow for the election of a new 10 person Board of directors, to come into office on 1 November, and the Chief Scout would no longer be a director, pending approval from extraordinary National Councils in June and October. Presentation of awards Among the responsibilities of the Chief Scout are the presentation of Chief Scout Awards to Scouts and the investiture of Scouters into the Order of C√∫Chulainn. Under ONE Programme, the Chief Scout will share presentation of the Chief Scout Award for Rover Scouts with the President of Ireland, as the award is linked to Gaisce ‚Äì The President's Award.

The character was portrayed and created by Gwar co-founder Hunter Jackson. Character overview Techno Destructo is described coming \\"from beyond Venus, beyond Jupiter, and that's way past Uranus, buddy,\\" and that he \\"drinks multi-lube and jerks off to Popular Mechanics.\\" It is known that Techno was one of the Scumdogs of the Universe - the Master's elite corps of warriors used to fight his ancient enemies (most notably Cardinal Syn; the video to \\"The Road Behind\\" shows Techno and Oderus teaming up against Syn, the only known footage of the two on the same team) - and that when Gwar opposed the Master, Techno opposed Gwar. The following millions of years, though never actually described in full, have Techno searching for his brethren to re-enlist them on the side of the Master. Gwar repeatedly engage in battle with him. His repeated defeats never seem to weaken his resolve, though, and neither does his enslavement (immediately following the Tour de Scum). He remains a slave for a number of years, working to take Gwar down from within. It was after the slave revolt that Techno regained his arm and revived Gor-Gor as a cyborg-zombie dinosaur. He didn't count on losing the remote control, which somehow found its way into Slymenstra's possession. With Gor-Borg out of his control, he was maimed, but remained alive. It is explained from old entries at Gwar.net that Techno was responsible for sending the Morality Squad after Gwar, and that he summoned Cardinal Syn, who in turn dispatched Skulhedface. Using Techno's genitalia as a plug, Gwar was able to broadcast Slave Pit TV everywhere, and killed enough people to awaken the World Maggot, but were stopped by Skulhedface. With Skulhedface defeated, Techno tricked Gwar into thinking the year 1996 was in fact the year 1999 (the reason the tour was called RagNaRok N' Roll 1999), and thus, according to prophecy, the world was about to end with the coming of the comet RagNaRok. It was, in fact, not a comet, but Cardinal Syn. Gwar had to free Techno in order to defeat him. After Cardinal Syn's defeat, Techno had raised enough support among Gwar's other slaves to begin his next series of plans to defeat Gwar. Using a robot duplicate of Sleazy P. Martini, Techno issued radioactive crack to Gwar, which hypnotized Slymenstra Hymen. Meanwhile, he genetically engineered abused penguins (abused by Gwar) into foul creatures as his second wave of attack. This was ultimately halted, but by then, Techno's wedding had begun. Once the crack wore off, however, Slymenstra exacted her revenge, but was not able to defeat him outright. Techno regained his arm and engaged Gwar once again, being defeated when the band revived Gor-Gor (with remnants of the radioactive crack) and had the beast disarm Techno once again. He was mentioned in the Ska-Parade session \\"Gwar vs. The Aquabats\\" in which he is said to be helping Gwar fight The Aquabats (though it's not known why he helped Gwar). Techno's final appearance with Gwar was on the 2000 Halloween tour. Jackson left Slave Pit in 2002 leading Oderus Urungus to insist that he killed Techno Destructo during the Art-Fag Wars of the early 21st century. During his comments on the 2006 DVD Blood Bath and Beyond, Oderus declares his respect for Techno and Bozo, though he would still \\"talk shit about them any chance I get.\\" Techno is, however, still referenced in later Gwar songs (specifically in \\"GWARnography\\" and \\"The Litany of the Slain\\"), and in 2009, he was briefly shown as a still graphic in a pre-show video on tour. New Destructo Duo On Gwar's Electile Dysfunction 08' U.S tour Gwar faced a new, revised Destructo team with the introduction of the new character & long-lost Scumdog, Sawborg Destructo (played by Matt Maguire), who is armed with a saw-type weapon and bears a resemblance to the other Destructos before him, along with the more experienced Bozo Destructo, who was Techno's tag-team partner in Gwar's other, earlier Mid-Galactic Wrestling tours. The new team battled to \\"The Private Pain of Techno Destructo\\" from Carnival of Chaos, and they provided new lyrics, after taking turns singing Techno's original lines using their names (\\"I got gas and oil flowing through my veins. I got wire and plastic in my brain. I'm Bozo Destructo. Bozo Destructo!\\"). Hunter Jackson Hunter Jackson was one of the original members of and co-founders of Gwar, having formed the Slave Pit Inc., the art collective which serves as Gwar's production company, in Richmond, Virginia in 1984. Jackson originally intended to film a low-budget space pirate movie entitled Scumdogs of the Universe, for which he created what would become the costumes for the original Gwar line-up when Dave Brockie borrowed the costumes to wear with this then-band Death Piggy, ultimately leading to the creation of Gwar. In 1986, Jackson briefly moved to Detroit during the period when Gwar was recording their debut album Hell-O; thus, Gwar member Don Drakulich portrayed the role of Techno Destructo on the song \\"Techno's Song\\". During his time with Gwar, Jackson was responsible for contributing to a lot of the band's creative concepts and non- musical artistic endeavors, acting as a writer and artist for the band's line of comic books (\\"Slave Pit Funnies\\"), monthly newsletters (\\"Mind Control Monthly\\") and scripts for the band's shows. Jackson also worked as a director, writer, producer and actor for both Gwar's live videos and long-form movies including Phallus in Wonderland (for which he also illustrated the cover art) and Skulhedface. Jackson, a self-described \\"game geek\\" and contributor to d8 magazine, was also instrumental in designing Gwar's 1999 board game Rumble in Antarctica. Though not an instrumentalist, Jackson contributed occasional live vocals for Gwar's shows, and most notably sang lead on the songs \\"The Morality Squad\\" on America Must Be Destroyed (as his characters Edna P. Granbo and Corporal Punishment), \\"The Private Pain of Techno Destructo\\" on Carnival of Chaos (as Techno Destructo) and \\"Tune from Da Moon\\" on We Kill Everything (as Scroda Moon), all of which he received co-writing credits for. Jackson was also the voice of Cardinal Syn and provided the vocals on \\"Surf of Syn\\" from Ragnar√∂k, though the role went uncredited in the album's liner notes. Jackson left Gwar in November 2000, and neither he nor his characters have returned to the band in any capacity since. According to Don Drakulich, there were allegedly tensions between Jackson and members of Slave Pit, primarily between him and Dave Brockie, stemming from creative differences and disagreements over business which contributed to his leaving. Since departing Gwar, Jackson has relocated to Los Angeles and continues to build artificial prostheses, a skill he has credited with influencing his work with Gwar and providing him with prop-building materials to work with. Despite no longer being associated with Gwar, Jackson has continued to appear as Techno Destructo and Scroda Moon at comic conventions and independent professional wrestling organizations in California.. In 2006 and 2007, he appeared at the Comic-Con to promote Gwar's line of action figures from Shocker Toys which were ultimately unreleased. Jackson has provided artwork for California comedy punk band The Radioactive Chicken Heads, which the band has used for t-shirts, posters and visuals for their music video \\"Cluck You!\\". On September 1, 2013, Jackson appeared with the band as Techno Destructo during their set opening for The Dickies at the Whisky A Go Go in Hollywood. Jackson also appears and wrestles as Techno Destructo for Sinn Bodhi's Freakshow Wrestling promotion in California.

The legs are stretched out straight and lifted; the arms are stretched straight back, palms down, and lifted; the head is lifted and the gaze is directed straight ahead. It is a back bend, or spine stretch, utilizing the strength of the upper and middle back to lift the weight of the legs as high as possible from a starting position while face down on the floor.

Trade was the second nightclub Laurence had run at Turnmills; his first was Xanadu, which he co-hosted with the club promoter Robert Pereno. Laurence was a member of the electronic music duo Big Bang when he opened Trade. The history of Trade is inextricably linked with the evolution of Turnmills as a club venue.

Xanadu ran successfully for around 5-6 months. It was only after Turnmills owner John Newman decided to promote Saturday evenings himself that Laurence was offered the alternative timeslot from 3.00 am onwards on Sunday mornings, after John had secured an all-night license from Islington Council. Turnmills was the first London venue to be offered such a license. Laurence accepted the challenge.

The space was dark, and a little unsavoury. Pushed into one corner was a beat up old grand piano. In later interviews, Laurence recalled, ‚ÄòTrade had been running on an underground tip for the first few months‚Äôi-D magazine, 16 October 2015 ‚Äì The Visual Legacy of 90s Gay Club Trade (article) (retrieved 18 September 2020): https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/8xgzgb/the-visual-legacy-of-90s-gay-club- trade Three or four months into the residency, and still finding it difficult to pull in customers, Laurence took decisive action. ‚ÄòI invited Tim Stabler to co-promote it with me and oversee the d√©cor in the club.‚Äô At the time, other clubs such as Heaven, G-A-Y and The Fridge closed at around 2am to 3am on Sunday mornings, an hour or so before Trade opened at 3am. It took a while for clubbers to cotton on to the fact that they were able to go straight on to Trade to continue clubbing all night after the other clubs had closed. Once they did, Trade exploded into the phenomena it became. At the time many guys went cruising in the parks after leaving other clubs. The name 'Trade' and the opening hours was to encourage guys to go to the club as a safer alternative. Turnmills was the first club in the UK to be given a 24-hour \\"Music & Dance\\" licence. This was gained after Laurence Malice had for a long period of time tried to convince Newman that there was a need for people to be able to party in a safe environment after 3am.  Trade D√©cor/Artwork  To decorate the interior of the club, fluorescent banners and wall-hangings were used, illuminated by ultra violet lighting. When Laurence brought Tim Stabler on board, Tim produced some amazing interior d√©cor for the club.Trade ‚Äì An Oral History ‚Äì Laurence Malice: Trade Laurence also commissioned the artists TradeMark (Mark Wardell), Martin ‚ÄòB-Art‚Äô Brown, and Mark McKenzie to create many of the images and artworks used over the years for the interior of the club and for advertising and promotions. Turnmills - Trade's London home. 1995‚Äì2001 In the mid-late 1990s, Laurence decided to export the Trade brand internationally. Over the next few years, Trade held events throughout the UK and worldwide, in addition to releasing a number of CDs. For New Years Eve, 1995, Trade were unable to hold their (by now legendary) New Year's Eve party at Turnmills. This happened because New Year's Eve 1995 fell on a Sunday and the usual Turnmills Sunday night club - FF - held their NYE night at Turnmills. Trade held a successful New Years Day party at the Leisure Lounge in Holborn, London instead. In 1998, Trades popular DJ Tony De Vit died. Due to the global success of Trade, UK Channel 4 television commissioned an hour- long documentary Trade the all-night bender which was broadcast on 9 August 1998 as part of the Queer Street series of programmes. It featured in the BBC2 programme \\"Gaytime TV\\" and also had a regular weekly radio show on Atlantic252. On May 27, 1999, Turnmills ended Trade's residency due to security problems at the previous week's event. Trade negotiated a 4-week run at LA2 in the London Astoria. During this time the management of Trade and Turnmills resolved the issues. Trade returned to Turnmills on July 3, 1999, for the post Mardi Gras (the renamed London Gay Pride) party. The following month on August 7, 1999, Trade had a dance tent at Summer Rites in Brockwell Park, the first time they had a tent at the festival. Towards the end of the 1990s, as Turnmills fitted out more space in the venue, Trade expanded into a second room, which Laurence named the 'Trade lite lounge'. The room played a lighter funkier style of house music which quickly gained a big following. In 2000, Trade hosted one of the two main stages (the other BBC Radio 1) for the first UK Love Parade festival held at Roundhay Park, Leeds the event was attended by 1,500,000 people.  DJs  The original Trade resident DJs were, Martin Confusion, Daz Saund, Trevor Rockliffe, Smokin Jo, and Malcolm Duffy, These were followed most notably by the late Tony De Vit, but also Tall Paul, Alan Thompson, Steve Thomas, Pete Wardman, Ian M, and Fergie Other DJs who have graced the decks include Sister Bliss, EJ Doubell, Rachel Auburn, Queen Maxine, BK (Ben Keen), Lisa German, Rosco, Darren M, Gonzalo Rivas, The Sharp Boys, Steve Haswell, Fat Tony, Andy Farley, Mark Kavanagh, Strawberry K, DJ Big Al, Guy Williams, Ziad, Jon Dennis, Pagano, Nik Denton, Nick Tcherniak, Lady Bianca, Andy M, Gabriele Cutrano, Tom McMillan, and Russell.

Trade Final at Turnmills  Towards the end of Trade‚Äôs existence, Laurence had already realised the club had become a victim of its own popularity. ‚ÄòWith Trade it became difficult to live up to some peoples‚Äô expectations, and certain members of the Trade family didn‚Äôt want things to change and wanted to influence how the party should be.

This was due to the expected closure of Turnmills as a clubbing venue. The news was subsequently confirmed on January 24, 2008, when Turnmills officially announced the venues closure. A further press release on January 30, 2008, announced that the final date was being brought forward by one week to Sunday, March 16, 2008. This was due to \\"so many 'sell out' events at Turnmills over Easter it would not be practical to run Trade After-Hours over this weekend\\". Within a few weeks of the tickets going on sale, the event sold out. Many of the original Trade DJs returned for the final event, including Steve Thomas, Ian M, Daz Saund, Malcolm Duffy, Pete Wardman and Fergie. The club opened its doors at 05:00 and during the night Laurence made a speech in the main room, thanking the clubbers and his associates, and asking everyone 'to really go for it!'. The party continued until the final record, Schoneberg by Marmion, was played by Pete Wardman, finishing at 17:45. The Turnmills building has now been demolished and in its place stands a six-storey office complex part of which incorporates the uber cool Albion restaurant that proudly gives a nod to its famous former residents.Albion restaurant: Albion restaurant  Laurence Malice biography and clubbing history  Laurence Mullane, known professionally as Laurence Malice, was born in the East End of London. His parents originated from Ireland, and he grew up in a traditional Catholic household. He attended a comprehensive Catholic school where he excelled in art. His aspirations of furthering his art studies were dashed when he discovered he was colour blind. Laurence left school at 16 and entered the law profession working as an articled clerk in the Probate Office at a Bishopsgate law firm. After almost two years working in law, Laurence resigned and took a sabbatical, which led to him changing his career path. Laurence has since worked in the entertainment industry for most of his life. ‚ÄòI started acting at the age of about seventeen in Holland. From there, I went to Australia, where I got my Equity card. I worked on a few movies and did commercials, milk ads, and puerile stuff like that.‚ÄôMalice In Wonderland (article) (retrieved 13/09/2020): https://www.hotpress.com/music/malice-in-wonderland-416539 It was in Australia that Laurence first began putting on parties, although being a club promoter was not the initial appeal. ‚ÄòI was more into putting on different styles of parties. My passion has always been doing something a bit different, a bit quirky.‚Äô Laurence also made a small appearance in the popular Australian TV drama The Sullivans. Laurence remained in Australia for around eighteen months, living in Sydney, Perth, and Melbourne, and it was in Australia that Laurence formed his first band, Larry Malice & The Razor Sharps. Upon Laurence‚Äôs return to London in the early 1980s, he began hosting parties at different city venues.

Social Security Administration. was an American chef and cookery writer who helped introduce Americans to Chinese cuisine. Background Tropp was born and raised in Springfield, New Jersey, the daughter of podiatrists. Her father was Dr. Bernard E. Tropp, whose parents were born in the Austrian Empire.Bernard Trepp [Tropp] in the 1920 United States Census She grew up in a strong Jewish community with a German grandmother whose cooking including sauerbraten and apple strudel. She fell in love with Chinese culture due to an art class in high school. She studied Chinese at Barnard College and earned a PhD from Princeton University, becoming fluent in Mandarin. Two years in Taiwan and a fortuitous stay with food obsessed host families led to her immersion in the intricacies of Chinese cuisine. During this time she studied poetry and made many visits to the national art museum. Her burgeoning understanding of Chinese culture reinforced her studies of Chinese cuisine. The Modern Art of Chinese Cooking When Tropp returned to America, she soon dropped out of Princeton and moved to San Francisco to be closer to a vibrant Chinese community and food markets. She soon had a contract to write the Modern Art of Chinese Cooking in 1983. James Beard described it as \\"...a unique achievement. Her intelligent and thorough explanations are detailed and truly great. The choice of recipes is exciting. This is a magnum opus for any cooking addict.\\" The Modern Art of Chinese Cooking brought Barbara international acclaim as it served as a guide for non-Chinese speakers into the subtle delicacies of an elaborate and highly refined cuisine. China Moon Cafe Between 1986 and 1997, Barbara Tropp ran a very successful Chinese restaurant named China Moon Cafe in a 1930s era coffee shop in San Francisco. Similar to Chez Panisse in Berkeley, China Moon Cafe drew foodies from around the world who came for the unique combination of California cuisine infused with a deep knowledge of another traditional food culture. Frequent visitors to the restaurant during this time included people like Robin Williams, Christopher Reeve and Julia Child who had developed a close friendship with Barbara. The restaurant hummed with precision and flavorful smells and vibrant colors. Chefs who trained with Barbara went on to illustrious careers with chefs like Wolfgang Puck. Staff alumni from the restaurant include the Vietnamese-American filmmaker Paul Kwan and the opera singer Julie Queen and sous chef and later restaurant owner Richard Katz. Chef Nance Tourigny worked with Tropp in the early 1990s and went on to establish her successful personal chef business in Seattle working for prominent clients like Craig McCaw. Tropp's enthusiasm for wok cooking was almost mystical -- chefs were instructed from day one on creating a proper, a column of smoke summoned from the center of the wok with clanging wok tools, where seared vegetables and meats were tossed about and gained a delicious smokiness that is the true hallmark of wok flavor. China Moon Cookbook During this time Tropp wrote China Moon Cookbook, a simpler more informal cookbook of recipes and techniques developed at China Moon Cafe. A representative quote from the book describes the atmosphere and flavor of China Moon Cafe well: > China Moon food is, at its best, gutsy and bold. There is a loud stereo of > flavor emanating from our dishes-not the equivalent of a rock concert, thank > you, but more like the gallop of Vivaldi's \\"Four Seasons\\" with its big > crescendos of tonality followed by moments of quiet resonance. Another quotation from the book reads: > 'Cosmic Chaos' is my favorite pun of all. This is the meaning of won-ton as > it appears in the first line of every ancient Chinese cosmology. In the > beginning the universe was a won-ton (chaos) inside a thin shell, before the > earth separated into the dark and the heaven into the light.

The organization is based in Bozeman, Montana and works to promote and support community-based education throughout Central Asia, primarily in Pakistan and Afghanistan, by building schools, supporting teacher-training programs, and funding school scholarships. CAI's mission is to \\"empower local communities of Central Asia through literacy and education, especially for girls, promote peace through education, and convey the importance of these activities globally.\\" The organization collaborates with communities to build schools in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan, with a particular emphasis on areas where there is little or no access to education. Pennies for Peace is an affiliated organization that partners with schools and clubs in the United States and around the world to raise pennies for CAI's educational efforts. After a 60 Minutes segment aired questions about the organization's effectiveness, the Central Asia Institute has become a reference example for the limitations in evaluating charities based solely on financial analysis. History CAI was registered as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization in 1996. Greg Mortenson, co- founder of CAI, began his work in Pakistan in 1993. The organization was established with funds from co-founder Jean Hoerni, a Swiss physicist and Silicon Valley microchip pioneer. Mortenson's first visit to Pakistan was during his expedition to climb K2, the world's second-highest mountain. It was on this expedition that Mortenson met the Balti people, who inspired his humanitarian efforts. For three years, from 1993-1996, Mortenson spent long periods of time in the Karakoram Mountain villages of Pakistan. His first project was a bridge over the Braldu River, which enabled the community and him to transport building materials to Korphe village, where he built his first school. Hoerni provided funding for these first two projects and subsequently established Central Asia Institute as a non-profit organization in the United States in 1996. Mortenson was appointed as its director. Hoerni died a year later from leukemia. CAI's first Board of Directors decided to focus the organization's efforts in the Karakoram Mountains of Pakistan in order to establish relationships to further community-based projects in the area. By the late 1990s, CAI had begun to expand into other remote areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan. By 2008, CAI had set up 55 schools in Pakistan and nine schools in Afghanistan. Of those 63 schools, 43 were schools for girls. In 2011, the organization began working in the Gorno Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast, in eastern Tajikistan. CAI also completed various projects in Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan in the 1990s. The organization's efforts are detailed on the CAI Master Project List, and the story of how CAI was founded is outlined in the 2006 New York Times best-selling book Three Cups of Tea by Mortenson and David Oliver Relin.\\"Paperback Nonfiction Bestsellers\\", The New York Times, March 16, 2008\\"American mountaineer fights Taliban with books, not bombs\\", John Blake, CNN International, March 3, 2008\\"Famous author, humanitarian visits Paly\\" , Megha Ram, The Paly Voice (Palo Alto, CA), November 19, 2007 Programs CAI has several types of programs that help the organization carry out its mission to promote peace through education. Since 1996, CAI's programs have supported more than 300 community-initiated educational projects. The organization's programs and projects include the following: School building, maintenance, equipment, and supplies: Projects in this category are related to the direct costs of building new schools, updating and/or maintaining existing schools, and providing necessary materials for the schools. This often includes ongoing support for uniforms, school equipment, and individual school supplies for students. Each of these projects includes local people. Scholarships: CAI provides scholarships for advanced education. Teacher support: CAI funds teacher training in some areas. CAI pays teachers' salaries when support is not provided by the government. Public health: CAI provides funds for maternal healthcare, nutrition and hygiene awareness, disaster relief projects, and the installation of clean water systems. These efforts have included education for the victims of the 2005 Kashmir earthquake. The quake killed 74,000 people, including 18,000 students, and displaced 2.8 million people. CAI has rebuilt or re-established 16 schools destroyed in the earthquake. Women's literacy & vocational centers: CAI supports literacy centers, where women of all ages get free lessons in reading, writing, and math, bringing them to about a 4th grade level of education. These centers also teach hygiene, sanitation, nutrition, and money management. CAI also supports vocational centers that train women in sewing, weaving, knitting, and provide equipment and materials. Community support: CAI will occasionally fund small community projects when the community requests them. These projects include building bridges, establishing museums, providing porter training, among other projects. Global outreach: CAI promotes the importance of education and literacy via the organization's website as well as other social media venues. The organization also publishes an annual magazine, \\"Journey of Hope,\\" about its programs and projects. CAI created the Pennies for Peace curriculum to teach students about the importance of service learning. Controversy On April 17, 2011, CBS' 60 Minutes aired an investigative story on CAI and Mortenson. The story alleged that CAI spent more money on 'domestic outreach' (book tours, speaking, travel) than on supporting schools overseas, and that Mortenson's accomplishments may have been exaggerated. CBS's story included an interview with Daniel Borochoff, president of the American Institute of Philanthropy, who alleged that CAI spent $1.7 million one year on \\"book related expenses\\" for books such as Three Cups of Tea. He further stated that CAI did not receive any proceeds from the sales of the book, but did receive a small income from Mortenson's speaking engagements. The 60 Minutes report featured best-selling author Jon Krakauer, who described what he called suspicious financial machinations within CAI. In 2002, the treasurer of the CAI had quit along with other board members. On April 19, 2011, the Attorney General of Montana announced an inquiry into CAI's finances. After a year-long investigation, Mortenson agreed to repay $1 million to the CAI. The Montana inquiry found no criminality, but required changes in CAI's governance, management, and financial controls going forward. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Mortensen was required to resign as executive director and could no longer serve as a voting member of CAI's board. In 2014, Charity Navigator gave Central Asia Institute a four-star rating with high scores on both capacity and efficiency, but added a \\"Donor Advisory\\" with details of the claims made in the CBS report, and links to claims by critics and Mortenson's responses.McWhirter, Cameron, \\"The Big Spill Over 'Three Cups Of Tea'\\", Wall Street Journal, 30 April 2011, p. C3. The Better Business Bureau reviewed the organization's standing and updated its rating to include CAI as an accredited charity. GuideStar updated CAI's rating to three stars and the \\"Gold Participant\\" designation for its commitment to transparency. In January 2014, Mortenson was interviewed on Today by Tom Brokaw. He apologized and acknowledged that he had let a lot of people down, and said \\"I failed in many ways, and it's an important lesson.\\" In August 2014 Krakauer wrote a follow-up article for The Daily Beast in which he stated that an audit of CAI's overseas projects indicated that the charity was still \\"beset by widespread corruption\\" and that Mortenson remaining as the public face of the charity was not \\"in the best interest of the charity or the people it serves\\". He concluded that \\"anyone thinking about donating to CAI should probably reconsider\\". In May 2015, the Montana Attorney General stated that Central Asia Institute and Greg Mortenson had completed the terms of a three- year compliance monitoring period, and CAI stated that the IRS had completed its examination of the nonprofit. The organization reported that it was having a return in donors and rise in contributions.

Along the way they encounter the exiled Napoleon Bonaparte and the Scottish former Royal Navy officer Lord Cochrane.

Sharpe and Harper sail to Chile with Spanish Colonel Ruiz and his regimental officers aboard the frigate Espiritu Santo, commanded by Captain Ardiles. The group decide to stop off en route at St. Helena to pay a visit to exiled French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. Napoleon grants an audience and asks Sharpe and Harper to remain for a private conversation. Napoleon persuades Sharpe to taking a gift to an admirer in Chile for him. British Consul George Blair welcomes Sharpe and Harper to the Chilean port of Valdivia and informs them that Blas Vivar's body was found and buried three months previously.

Sharpe and Harper meet with Bautista, who announces that he has caught the thieves, whom he has branded on the spot, and returns all the stolen goods except for Napoleon's present. When Bautista asks if everything is there, Sharpe says nothing is missing. Marquinez provides the required passes and permits and rides out with Sharpe and Harper on the first stage of their journey. Overnighting at the \\"Celestial Fort\\", Sharpe suspects that their escort, commanded by Sergeant Dregara, has orders to kill them. He persuades the garrison commander, Captain Morillo, to let them leave very early the next morning; he provides a native scout called Ferdinand to guide them safely across the hills. Sharpe and Harper arrive in Puerto Crucero and are welcomed by Major Suarez, but before they can exhume the body, Sergeant Dregara catches up and arrests them. After five days in prison, they are accused by Bautista of espionage. He reveals that a coded message was found hidden in Napoleon's gift. As punishment, the Captain-General has Ferdinand executed, confiscates the riflemen's money and weapons and has them deported back to Europe on board the Espiritu Santo. Lord Cochrane, a former Royal Navy officer now in service to the Chilean rebels under Bernardo O'Higgins, ambushes the Espiritu Santo and, with the assistance of Sharpe and Harper, capture it, taking Captain Ardiles prisoner. Cochrane rendezvouses with his flagship the O'Higgins, patches up the rapidly sinking Espiritu Santo, loads Major Miller and his marines aboard the crippled ship, and sets sail for a suicidal attack upon the port of Puerto Crucero. Cochrane and Miller lead the marines ashore, with Sharpe and Harper in tow, and with supporting fire from the O'Higgins capture the citadel. Blas Vivar's grave is opened to reveal nothing but a dead dog inside. A captured Spanish soldier informs them that Blas Vivar is being held prisoner in Valdivia, so Sharpe reluctantly agrees to join Cochrane's assault on the city. Despite being massively outnumbered and outgunned, Cochrane sails to Valdivia, hoping his two disguised ships will be mistaken for transports bringing much-needed reinforcements. However, his ruse fails. Sharpe recommends landing on a nearby beach and leads an assault on the outlying forts. The demoralized Spanish put up token resistance before either fleeing or surrendering, resulting in little loss of life on the rebel side. Without waiting for reinforcements, Cochrane marches his small forces into the city itself, where Sharpe and Harper kill Dregara. Bautista then commits suicide. Realising that Blas Vivar is not a prisoner in Valdivia, Sharpe confronts Cochrane, who admits that he took the Spaniard prisoner and marooned him and some others on an island. Cochrane is plotting to rescue Napoleon, so he can create another empire in the New World. The coded message was Napoleon's agreement to Cochrane's scheme. Cochrane duped Sharpe because he needed his help in liberating Valdivia. Cochrane releases Blas Vivar, but holds him, Sharpe, and Harper incommunicado until the rescue ship sets sail. When they are released, the three men return to St. Helena, but are stunned to hear that Napoleon has died. Sharpe, immensely relieved that he is in no way responsible for starting another war, prepares to return home for good.

It stands at 66 cm in height and was inspired by earlier bronze vases (not existing so early; it was inspired by a Lakonian shape, produced in terracotta - M.I.). It was used for wine (and water - M.I.). A milestone in the development of ancient Greek pottery due to the drawing style used as well as the combination of related stories depicted in the numerous friezes, it is dated to circa 570/560 BCE. The Francois Vase was discovered in 1844 (and 1845 - M.I.) in Chiusi where an Etruscan tomb in the necropolis of Fonte Rotella was found located in central Italy. It was named after its discoverer Alessandro Fran√ßois, it is now in the Museo Archeologico at Florence. It remains uncertain whether the krater was used in Greece or in Etruria, and whether the handles were broken and repaired in Greece or in Etruria. Perhaps the Fran√ßois Vase was made for a symposium given by a member of an aristocratic family in Solonian Athens (possibly for a special occasion, such as a wedding), then broken and, after being carefully repaired, was sent to Etruria, perhaps as an instance of elite-gift exchange. It bears the inscriptions \\"Ergotimos mepoiesen\\" and \\"Kleitias megraphsen\\", meaning \\"Ergotimos made me\\" and \\"Kleitias painted me\\".\\"Making\\"/\\"poiein\\" and \\"painting\\"/\\"graphein\\" as two different activities in pottery are distinguished in painted signatures on ancient Greek pots as early as the middle of the 7th century BCE; while the first extant signature stating that someone \\"made\\" a pot comes from the late 8th century BCE, we find the earliest reference to its \\"painting\\" in an inscription on a pot dating from the middle of the 7th century BCE (see R. Wachter, Non-Attic Greek Vase Inscriptions, Oxford 2001, EUC 1 and IOI 5, respectively). It depicts 270 figures, 121 of which have accompanying inscriptions which is highly unusual for so many to be identified; the scenes depicted represent a number of mythological themes. In 1900 the vase was smashed into 638 pieces by a museum guard by hurling a wooden stool against the protective glass. It was later restored by Pietro Zei in 1902, followed by a second reconstruction in 1973 incorporating previously missing pieces. Descriptions of the Decorations Mistress of Animals above a vignette showing Ajax carrying the dead Achilles The uppermost frieze, on the neck of the krater, depicts on side ASo-called because it depicts the culmination of the procession shown on the vessel‚Äôs main frieze, the top band on the body, which is also the highest of all. the Calydonian Boar Hunt, including the heroes Meleager, Peleus, and Atalanta. The scene is flanked by two sphinxes which are separated from it by a band of lotus blossoms and palmettes. On the other side of the vessel, this zone features the dance of Athenian youths led by Theseus who is playing the lyre, standing opposite Ariadne and her nurse. Detail: the Calydonian Boar Hunt. The second band on side A shows the chariot race which is part of the funeral games for Patroclus, instituted by his loverFor the exact nature of the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus, see the article on Achilles and Patroclus. Achilles, in the last year of the Trojan War. Here, Achilles is standing in front of a bronze tripod, which would have been one of the prizes, while the participants include the Greek heroes Diomedes and Odysseus. On side B, the painted scene depicts a battle of the Lapiths and Centaurs. The most famous of these conflicts took place at the wedding party of Pirithous and Hippodamia, which is probably depicted here, as the hero Theseus is found among the combatants, a friend of Pirithous who himself was not a Lapith, but said to be among the wedding guests. The scene also includes the demise of the Lapith hero Caeneus. Kleitias e vasaio ergotimos, cratere fran√ßois, 570 ac ca. 01 The third frieze on both sides, the highest and also most prominent one because of its location on the top of the body vessel, depicts the procession of the gods to the wedding of Peleus and Thetis. Because of its large number of figures, the procession is a suitable topic to decorate the long band. The end of the procession shows Peleus between an altar and the house where Thetis can be seen sitting inside. He is greeting his teacher, the centaur Chiron, who is heading the procession together with the divine messenger Iris, followed by many other deities. The fourth frieze on side A depicts the ambush of Troilus by Achilles. Side B shows the return of Hephaestus to Olympus; sitting on a mule, he is led to the Olympian gods by Dionysus, followed by a group of silens and nymphs. The fifth frieze shows sphinxes and griffins flanking lotus blossom and palmettes ornaments and panthers and lions attacking bulls, a boar, and a deer. On the foot of the vessel, there is on both sides a depiction of the battle between the Pygmies and the cranes. The handles are decorated as well, showing on their outer sides the so-called Mistress of Animals above a vignette showing Ajax carrying the dead Achilles. The fields on the inner sides of the handles above the rim of the pot each feature a Gorgon in motion.  Interpretation of the Decorations  The wedding of Peleus and Thetis provides the central image on another signed Athenian pot, the Francois vase made by Kleitias and Ergotimos. Here only one of the six friezes which cover this pot is an animal frieze, and even that is quite remote in style from Corinthian work. All the others show episodes from myth, and labels are copiously used, even for inanimate objects such as fountains and seats. Florencia Fran√ßois 01 With the combination of related stories and the unique drawing style by kleitas, this pot constitutes something new in Athenian painting. The scenes on this pot include both crucial moments in stories, including when Peleus and Meleager are about to spear the Calydonian boar (top frieze). The moments where the crucial action is past with the dance of the Athenian maidens and youths freed from the Minotaur (top frieze) or the marriage of Peleus and Thetis. Also, as well as Achilles' pursuit of Troilos in the second frieze up. Past or future episodes are frequent in the friezes. The body of Antaios beneath the boar seems likely to allude to the death of the man who taunted Atalanta, seen here just behind Meleager, with not hunting in a manly enough way; beside Atalanta is Melanion, the man who won her hand in marriage either by his prowess as a hunter or by using trickery to beat her in a race. A fountain house, a dropped water jar, and the running figure of Polyxena signal the circumstances in which Achilles ambushing Troilos, but the gods around the fountain house seem to allude to Achilles' subsequent killing of Troilos in a sanctuary. The various scenes on the pot seem to be held together by two sorts of association. On one hand there are a set of scenes which trace the story of the house of Peleus from his participation in the hunt for the Calydonian boar, through his marriage to Thetis. It goes all the way to the role in the Trojan War of their son Achilles, who puts on funeral games for his companion Patroclus (second frieze down), ambushes Troilos and finally is himself carried dead from the battlefield by Ajax. The kneeling figure of Ajax carries the corpse of Achilles from the battlefield at Troy. Achilles thus appears twice close on one side of the vase: alive while organizing the funeral games for his dead companion Patroklos and immediately adjacent, he is dead himself. On the other hand there are scenes which offer parallels to these episodes: the processional return of the god Hephaestus to Olympus (second frieze up) parallels the celebration of Peleus' wedding to Thetis. The battle of lapiths and centaurs and the liberation of the Athenians from the Minotaur parallel the deliverance from the Calydonian boar, and link Peleus' exploits to those of the Athenian hero Theseus. Such typological parallels are one of the means by which poets too from Homer on have enriched their narratives  Kleitas and Ergotimos  Kleitias e vasaio ergotimos, cratere fran√ßois, 570 ac ca. giochi funebri per patroclo 03 During the Archaic Period, Kleitas (Cleitas) (c. 580- c. 550 BCE) was a well known potter and painter. He was the painter of one of the greatest vases ever made from Greek art, the Francois Vase. Kleitas signature has been found on five vases, four of them are signed by Kleitias as the painter and Ergotimos as the potter. Other collaborations of the two include two cups and some cup fragments, from which their signatures were lost. Other vases have been attributed to Kleitas on the basis of style. Kleitas was detailed in his drawings especially with animal and human anatomy and when showing textiles making him a unique artist of his time. He engages his viewers by bringing variety to every image allowing the viewer to discover each figure differently each time. He pioneers the use of paired figures: particularly in the topmost friezes on each side, the boar hunt. The boat returning from Crete, he makes repeated use of figures who are side by side and engaged in similar actions so that one sees only part of the figure behind, which becomes a sort of shadow of the figure in the front. Other collaborations of the two include two cups and some cup fragments, from which their signatures were lost. Other vases have been attributed to Kleitas on the basis of style.

The gasoline pill is one of several claims of suppressed inventions that circulate as urban legends. Usually these urban legends allege a conspiracy theory that the oil industry seeks to suppress the technology that turns water to gasoline. Guido Franch In the United States, the best known claim to have created a gasoline pill was the work of one Guido Franch, who was active from the 1950s through the 1970s. Franch called the resulting liquid Mota fuel, mota being atom spelled backwards. Guido Franch was a blue collar worker who lived in Livingston, Illinois. His invention was a green powder that was added to water, which he claimed had actually been invented by a fictitious German scientist named Dr. Alexander Kraft. Franch took money from a number of small investors who read about his claims in the National Tattler or a similar tabloid publication. In what became a frequent motif, he claimed that the water-into-gasoline powder formula could not be disclosed for fear that the oil industry would have it suppressed. Franch, when pressed into providing samples of his transmutation powder, produced samples of green food coloring. As a result of his activities, Franch was prosecuted several times for fraud. His first trial in 1954 resulted in his acquittal when a prosecution witness admitted that it might be possible that \\"mota fuel\\" worked. His second trial in 1979 resulted in his conviction.\\"Is there a pill that can turn water into gasoline?\\" at The Straight Dope Other water-to-gasoline \\"inventors\\" In 1916, Louis Enricht claimed to have a water to gasoline pill. Enricht was convicted of fraud in a related case, claiming to have a method for extracting gasoline from peat, and served time in Sing Sing prison. (The Fischer-Tropsch process, which can accomplish this, had not been invented yet.) In 1917, John Andrews pitched a water to gasoline powder to the United States Navy. Andrews disappeared after making his pitch, but it turned out that he had returned to Canada, where he was serving in the Royal Canadian Navy.FOCUS, Volume 1, Number 10 (December 31, 1985) In 1996, Ramar Pillai from South India (Tamil Nadu) claimed to be able to transmute water to gasoline by a herbal formula that he claimed was the result of a miraculous bush Boswellia ovalifoliolata . Pillai obtained of land to cultivate his bush, but in fact it turned out that he was using sleight of hand to substitute kerosene for the liquid he claimed to have derived from the bush. In October 2016 Pillai and an associate were convicted of fraud and sentenced to 3 years of Rigorous Imprisonment. In an attempt to further demonstrate the working of his fuel, Ramar Pillai approached LMES, a science based youtube channel. His demonstrations were again proved to be fraudulent as he used Chloromethane, masked it with some stickers and tore apart its name and chemical composition from the label of the bottle and claimed that the bottle that contained actually Chloro methane was his secret recipe. The causes behind his fraudulent demonstrations at LMES are still unknown. In 1983, Wang Hongcheng announced his Hongcheng Magic Liquid, which could turn regular water into fuel with just a few drops. His announcement was widely covered by Chinese media, and he was even given public funding for a company that never released a product. Years later, in 1994, the Chinese government declared that superstition and pseudoscience was rising in China and that it would start efforts to stop it. One of those efforts was to publish an article critical of Hongcheng in Science and Technology Daily, thus turning the tide of public opinion against him. Hongcheng was investigated, put on trial, and condemned 10 years to prison for fraud and deceit. Between 1992 and 2007 a businessman called Tim Johnston managed to garner over $100 million from investors, principally in Australia and New Zealand, for the promotion of a \\"magic pill that cut emission and made fuel last longer\\". Registered in the Virgin Islands, his company Firepower finally collapsed. No assets could be retrieved and no evidence of the much-vaunted fuel tablet could be found. Despite the illusory nature of the product, the company had attracted high profile and prestigious promoters and investors from the arenas of Government, Military, sport and show business.Smoking out Firepower, at \\"Sydney Morning Herald\\" (January 30th 2010). Chemical impossibility A gasoline pill is chemically impossible. Gasoline is a hydrocarbon fuel; this means it consists of a mixture of molecules made up of carbon and hydrogen (e.g. Octane C8H18). Water on the other hand consists of hydrogen and oxygen (H2O). It would be necessary to introduce 8 parts carbon for every 9 parts of water to make any conversion of the form : 9 H2O + X ‚Üí C8H18 \\\\+ 9 O work, where X is the gasoline pill. The claims discussed here do not address the source of carbon needed to make up the balance, and instead propose that just a small amount of X would suffice, which is impossible due to conservation of mass. Also note that nuclear processes only found inside stars would be necessary to transmute hydrogen into carbon. Gasoline pills in fiction The storyline of the 1943 Laurel and Hardy film, Jitterbugs, revolves around a con man (Bob Bailey) selling gas pills during the fuel rationing days of WWII. In the 1949 motion picture Free For All, Robert Cummings starred as a scientist who claimed to have invented a pill that turned water into gasoline.Free For All entry at the IMDb. The 1940s television/radio show People Are Funny performed a stunt in which an unsuspecting crowd at Hollywood and Vine were sold \\"Atom Pills\\" at a quarter apiece. A \\"scientist\\" claimed that one pill could do the work of a hundred gallons of gasoline. When the stunt was revealed, few of the dozens who had fought to buy the pills came up to get their money back. In the television sitcom The Beverly Hillbillies, Jethro Bodine claimed to have devised a water to gasoline pill that ran the Clampetts' old truck on water. In an episode of the 1960s American sitcom The Munsters, The Sleeping Cutie, Grandpa invents a gasoline pill.IMDB episode listing A season three episode of the 1950s American television show, Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond, \\"Where Are They?\\", which originally aired 13 December 1960, presented a story about a man calling himself Charles Elton.

Early life The son of a motor dealer also named Roger Clark, after an education at Hinckley Grammar School where he gained 5 O Levels, like his younger brother Stan Clark - also later a rally driver - he joined his father's business as an apprentice. He learned about cars as a mechanic, and then helped the business take on new sales franchises. By 1975 there were four Roger Clark Cars Ltd. garages in the Leicester area, retailing under franchise agreements Alfa Romeo, Ford, Jensen, Lotus, Renault and Porsche. Career Club racing Clark passed his driving test in 1956, and immediately joined the Leicester Car Club, where he met Jim Porter, who was his co-driver for 20 years. Initially borrowing a Ford Model Y from his father's garage, he made his rallying debut at club level in 1956 in a pre-WWII Ford Prefect. The car used number plate 2 ANR, which Clark retained throughout his career, and often used for later private entries. After moving to compete in a 1950s Ford 100E van, in 1960 Clark and Porter began being placed after switching to a BMC Mini Cooper. In this car they won the East Midlands Rally Championship (1961 and 1962), came fourth overall and a class win in the International Circuit of Ireland (1963), third in the Motoring News Championship (1963), and third in his first Circuit of Scotland (1963). Works drives This success led to a series of works drives. In 1963 he drove a Triumph TR4 for Spa-Sofia-Liege, and in the same year a Reliant Sabre in the Alpine Rally. In 1964, whilst experimenting privately with a Ford Cortina GT, Clark agreed a two-year works deal with the Rover Company, for which in 1965 the pair won their Monte Carlo Rally category in a Rover 2000. During this period he also made the first two of his five Circuit of Scotland wins in 1964 in his private Ford Cortina, and with combined results won the first of his four British Rally Championship in 1965. Roger drove for BL during the 1980 season where he competed in the iconic TR7 V8 but with limited success. Ford works team Clark's 1972 RAC Rally-winning Escort RS1600 In 1966 Clark and Porter signed to a works Ford of Britain deal, with the successful partnership lasting 15 years. Ford of Britain lead the Ford of Europe rallying team, sponsored by Esso Uniflo, with Clark initially signed into a three-driver team all using the Ford Cortina GT alongside Vic Elford and Bengt Soderstrom. Under their customised contract, the company initially supplied Clark and Porter with improved chassis, body and full works blue-printed engines, which Clark then had built into rally cars in his own workshops. In 1968 Clark switched to the car that he was most associated with, the Ford Escort RS, which he rallied in works form until 1979, and then privately until he retired in the 1980s. Clark and Porter won British Rally Championship titles again in 1972, 1973 and 1975. His most notable successes came in the RAC Rally, the UK's biggest rally race. But as Porter was contracted to work for the rally organisers, Clark was forced to hire-in co-drivers for each of his wins. Clark won twice, in 1972 with Tony Mason, and then again - with the cars now sponsored by Cossack Hairspray, and hence coloured red - in 1976 with Stuart Pegg when it was part of the WRC, a feat that would not be emulated for over fifteen years. Clark's Cossack sponsored Ford Escort RS1800, winner of the 1976 Lombard RAC Rally Clark and Porter also won the Acropolis Rally in 1968, the Circuit of Ireland in 1970, and the Scottish Rally on six occasions, among a total of 40 national and international victories. In 1973, Clark led the East African Safari Rally by over an hour, when forced to retire at the halfway stage with a disintegrating car. As part of his later extended works-deal with Ford, Clark was contracted and paid as a development driver, for which he was asked to rally unusual models. These development excursions included rallying a Ford Zodiac in Eastern Europe, a Ford Capri in the Tour of Britain; and a Ford Escort attached to a Sprite Alpine to compete in the RAC and Caravan Club organised Caravan Rally of Great Britain, centred around Silverstone Circuit. Between 1969 and 1971, Clark also raced the Ford works team's Capri in Rallycross events across the UK. The 4WD V6-powered cars were initially successful against their 2WD opponents, but reliability issues and problems with drivability meant Ford dropped the Capri programme. Later rallying career Clark remained very loyal to Ford, but did on rare occasions compete in other makes. Due to undertake the 1974 BOAC 500 in a Porsche 911 Carrera, the assigned car did not start the event. However, many spectators did see a Porsche UK demonstrator Carrera compete the event, carrying the number plate 2 ANR. In 1975 Clark and Porter were recipients of the Segrave Trophy, bestowed upon \\"the Briton who accomplishes the most outstanding demonstration of the possibilities of transport by land, sea, air, or water.\\" He was awarded the MBE in 1979. Post-professional rallying Bronze statue of Roger Clark MBE at Mallory Park Clark never really retired from the sport of rallying, merely dropping back to club events again after his commercial sponsorship and supply of competitive cars dropped off, in part due to the new 4x4 Audi Quattro driven era. Clark remained influential in rallying and motorsport through committee membership of the British Racing Drivers Club, through which he helped to develop a new Rallysprint circuit at Silverstone in 1997. Clark focused most of his efforts on building the family business with his brother Stan in Leicestershire, having also opened \\"Roger Clark Cars\\" in Narborough in the 1970s. With all the businesses closed in the early 1990s due to the hard economic down turn, even with poor health in the mid-1990s he set-up \\"Roger Clark Motor Sport\\", which now run by his son Matt still prepares cars for others to use in rallying. His other son Olly Clark has been a competitor in the Time Attack UK series (winning the championship in 2008), Network Q Rally of Great Britain and the FIA Cup for Drivers of Production Cars. His autobiography co-authored by Graham Robson reflected his skill - on any surface - to make the Ford Escort \\"dance\\" sideways through corners, like his world-class Scandinavians equals Hannu Mikkola and Bj√∂rn Waldeg√•rd, entitled Sideways . . . to Victory. Clark died from the effects of a stroke on 12 January 1998.http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/march-1998/5/roger- clark-1940-1998 A bronze statue of Clark was later erected in his memory at Mallory Park. Roger Albert Clark Rally In 2004, a historic rally event was established to recreate the route of the \\"classic\\" five day long RAC Rally across the country, as the current rally format by the FIA WRC is scheduled under the existing shorter rally franchise layout, and is undertaken mainly in Wales.

History  Even if the Celts were the inhabit the area of Frossasco. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire the Lombards settled here, as can be seen by the archaeological excavation that in the Bivio area brought back to light by the old necropolis. The layout of the town centre has an apparently typical Roman layout, but is of medieval origins. Frossasco later was owned by the abbey of Novalesa, which donated it in 1064 to the Santa Maria Cloister of Pinerolo owned by the Marchioness Adelaide of Susa. The hamlet was given in 1561 to the Count Provana of Leyni and, later on, from 1536 to 1539, was occupied by the French. It went back to the House of Savoy but was again under the French between 1593 and 1595, until it became an Italian municipality.

Early life Acharya Ramchandra Shukla was born on October 4, 1882, Basti district in a wealthy Brahmin family,. His father Chandrabali Shukla was a Revenue Inspector (Kanoongo) at that time. Before he did his high school at London Mission School he learned Hindi, English and Urdu at his house by qualified teachers and then for further study he came to Prayagraj then Allahabad and continued his study; after that he wrote and published his valuable literature works and his experienced information. Biography The work of Shukla traces the genesis of Hindi poetry and prose since the 6th century and its development through Buddhist and Nath schools and the medieval contributions of Amir Khusro, Kabirdas, Ravidas, Tulsidas, stretching to the modern realism of Nirala and Premchand. In his assessment of Shukla (Acharya Ramchandra Shukla aur Hindi Alochana) eminent critic Dr. Ram Vilas Sharma emphasises the fact that the great writer opposed feudal and courtly literature as it did not give a true picture of the life of the common people and contemporary society. His works of literary criticism include Kavita Kya Hai, the most widely read essay explaining poetry and poetics in his outstanding collection Chintamani, published initially in two volumes as a collection of essays on emotions like anger and hatred. Recently his scattered and unpublished essays have been found and published as Chintamani-3 edited by Namwar Singh and Chintamani-4 by Kusum Chaturvedi. To enrich the worldview of Hindi speakers, Acharya Shukla translated Edwin Arnold's The Light of Asia into Buddha Charit (A biography of Gautam Buddha in Brij Bhasha verse) and German scholar Ernst Haeckel's famous work The Riddles of Universe into Vishwa Prapanch where he added his own thought-provoking preface by comparing its findings with Indian philosophical systems. These works signify that he did not restrict himself to be the foremost moderniser of the Hindi language, literature and thought. He was involved with scientific temper-building by translating and updating works of science and history. In developing a scientific methodology to investigate the literary works of several centuries as creations of socio-economic and political conditions of the respective era, Acharya Shukla became a pathbreaker. In his view true literature is not merely an expression of human consciousness as an end in itself but accounts for Lokmangal, a concept defining progress of society where common people are supreme and their sufferings are best understood as purpose for amelioration: literature, through aesthetics, must address itself to the pains/woes of the downtrodden and underdog and work for human emancipation from exploitation of all kinds. Acharya Ram Chandra Shukla was born on 4 October 1884 to Chandrabali Shukla in a small village‚ÄîAgona, Basti, Uttar Pradesh‚Äîduring British rule over India. He started his work in the world of letters with a poem and an article Prachin Bharatiyoin Ka Pahirava in Hindi and by writing in English his first published essay at the age of 17‚ÄîWhat Has India to do. Keeping in the spirit of anti- imperialism, in 1921, he wrote Non-co-operation and Non-mercantile Classes of India which was an attempt to look at the struggle of Indian classes in the set up of colonial and semi-feudal economy. Acharya Shukla taught at Banaras Hindu University Varanasi and chaired its department of Hindi during Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya's period from 1937 until he died (1941). Although not a regular story writer, he wrote a long Hindi story \\"Gyarah Varsh Ka Samay\\" to inspire original writing. His collection of original poems Madhushrota includes his adolescent hunger for hills, rocks, waterfalls, crops and birds, and images of his childhood sphere. His famous work Sahitya ka Itihaas was later edited online by a group of eminent Hindi writers and translators, led by Dr. Suresh Kumar Mishra \\"Uratrupt\\", writer and methodologist from Ranga Reddy, Andhra Pradesh.Hindi Sahitya ka Itihaas is considered as authentic Hindi literature. Ram Chandra Shukla was married to Savitri Devi and had two sons, Keshav Chandra and Gokul Chandra, and three daughters, Durgavati, Vidhya and Kamla. He was a painter and designed his own house, which was incomplete when he died in 1941. Acharya Ram Chandra Shukla Sahitya Shodh Sansthan, a research institute established in 1972 in his name, is a center of literary activities. It was built on the wish of his son Gokul Chandra Shukla and on the land provided by the Varanasi local authority. Later it got financial help from the state government of Uttar Pradesh for building and infrastructure. Its first secretary, Kusum Chaturvedi, published a regular journal Naya Mandand which established a reputation for its special numbers on women, postmodernism, Dalit Sahitya, among others. Its articles and research papers are acclaimed in Hindi and Indian languages literature. After the death of Kusum Chaturvedi, a connoisseur of literature, Gyan Datta Chaturvedi became the secretary. After his death, Dr. Manjeet Chaturvedi, son of Kusum Chaturvedi and Gyan Datta Chaturvedi, professor, Banaras Hindu University took over as the Secretary (MANTRI) of Acharya Ram Chandra Shukla Sahitya Shodh Sansthan; its Chairperson (ADHYAKSHA) is Dr. Mukta, a famous author of Hindi stories.

Built in 1774, is one of the premier colonial houses remaining in America from the British colonial period (1607‚Äì1776). It is the only existing work of colonial academic architecture that was principally designed from a plate in Andrea Palladio's I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura (The Four Books of Architecture) (1570). The house was designed by the architect William Buckland in 1773‚Äì1774 for wealthy farmer Matthias Hammond of Anne Arundel County, Maryland. It was modeled on the design of the Villa Pisani in Montagnana, Italy, as depicted in Book II, Chapter XIV of Palladio's work. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960, and is now managed by a non-profit organization as a museum. History Construction on the house began about April 1774, and most of the house was probably completed before the death of the architect in November or December of the same year. Owner Matthias Hammond probably never occupied his elegant house because he abruptly left Annapolis for his family's country estate in 1776. He died in 1786 after renting out the house for many years. The house passed to his nephews John, and then to Philip Hammond, who eventually sold the house to Ninian Pinkney in 1810. Pinkney, however, quickly sold the house to Judge Jeremiah Chase in 1811. Judge Chase bought the house as a home for the family of his daughter, Frances Townley Chase Loockerman. Chase was well acquainted with the house because he had rented the northeast wing, beginning in the late 1770s. Judge Chase's descendants lived in the house until the death of his great-granddaughter Hester Ann Harwood in 1924. Her mother, Judge Chase's granddaughter, married William Harwood, the great-grandson of William Buckland, the architect of the house. Hester Ann Harwood died intestate, and the house was sold in 1926 to St. John's College. The College used the house as a teaching tool for one of America's first courses taught on the decorative arts until financial necessity forced the college to sell to the Hammond‚ÄìHarwood House Association in 1940. This non-profit corporation continues to own the house and operates it as a public museum. Architecture Hammond‚ÄìHarwood House Main Facade The Villa Pisani, Montagnana from The Four Books of Architecture by Andrea Palladio, Giacomo Leoni, 1742 The house ranks architecturally with many of the great mansions built in the late Colonial period; however, it is the only house directly inspired from a plate in Palladio's, I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura. It is arguably the most exquisite house remaining from the Colonial period in America. Architect William Buckland adapted Palladio's Villa Pisani design to satisfy the tastes of colonial Annapolis. He re-designed the plan to accommodate the tastes for asymmetrical regional preferences and modified the hyphens from Palladio's arched entries to more practical single storey connecting links. He also incorporated fashionable urban design by sinking the windows in the method mandated by the London Building Act of 1774. This device provided better protection from fire and gave the overall design a greater degree of visual solidity and three dimensionality (see image at right). This adaptation from Palladio's model marks his maturity as an architect and ranks him as one of America's first and finest architects. The initial design of Thomas Jefferson's Monticello was taken from the Villa Cornaro in Piombino Dese, Italy, in Book II, Chapter XV of I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura, but this fa√ßade was later covered up by Jefferson's own expansions to his house. Thomas Jefferson made two drawings of the Hammond‚ÄìHarwood House when he served the government in Annapolis in 1783‚Äì1784. One could assume that Jefferson recognized the house as derived from Palladio because his knowledge of The Four Books of Architecture was extensive. He referred to the book as his architectural \\"bible\\" and the plate of the Villa Cornaro follows the Villa Pisani plate; and directly opposite the Villa Cornaro in some 18th-century English transcriptions of the work. Dining room with rococo carving attributed to Thomas Hall Description The Hammond‚ÄìHarwood House is a five-part brick house with a five-bay two-story central block, two-story end wings and one-story connecting hyphens on either side. The central block has a shallow hipped roof. The wings project toward the street with three-sided hipped-roof bays. The hyphens are rendered as a blind arcade, with the central bay a door opening with a pediment above. There is little decoration, with plain rubbed brick flat arches over the windows. Ornament is confined to the central bay, whose door is framed by engaged Ionic columns and topped by a fanlight. Above the door the second floor window is framed with a surround and entablature. The interior presents the appearance of symmetry where it is in fact not symmetrical, using false doors where necessary to maintain the illusion. The main rooms are the first-floor dining room and the second-floor ballroom immediately above, at the rear of the house overlooking the garden. The dining room features an opening, centered in the facade, that is treated as a door on the outside and as a window on the inside. The Hammond‚ÄìHarwood House was featured in Bob Vila's A&E; Network production, Guide to Historic Homes of America, in the two-hour segment on the Mid-Atlantic States.

Mare clausum is an exception to mare liberum (Latin for \\"free sea\\"), meaning a sea that is open to navigation to ships of all nations.Robert McKenna, \\"The Dictionary of Nautical Literacy\\", p. 225 McGraw-Hill Professional, 2003, Gabriel Adeleye, Kofi Acquah-Dadzie, Thomas J. Sienkewicz, James T.

Portugal and Spain defended a Mare clausum policy during the age of discovery.The licensing of vessels by the Portuguese was initiated by Prince Henry the Navigator in 1443, after Prince Pedro granted him the monopoly of navigation, war and trade in the lands south of Cape Bojador. Later this law would be enforced by the Bulls Dum Diversas (1452) and Romanus Pontifex (1455), more buls and treaties followed, the most significant being the Treaty of Tordesillas. This was soon challenged by other European nations.  History  From 30 BC to 117 AD the Roman Empire came to surround the Mediterranean by controlling most of its coasts. Romans started then to name this sea mare nostrum (Latin for \\"our sea\\").Tellegen-Couperus, Olga (1993). Short History of Roman Law, p.32. Routledge. . At those times the period between November and March was considered the most dangerous for navigation, so it was declared \\"mare clausum\\" (closed sea), although bans on navigation were probably never enforced.Conrad Gempf, \\"The Book of Acts in Its Graeco-Roman Setting\\", p.23, Volume 2, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1994, In classical law the ocean was not territorial. However, since the Middle Ages maritime republics like the Republic of Genoa and the Republic of Venice claimed a \\"Mare clausum\\" policy in the Mediterranean. Also Nordic kingdoms and England, required passage rates, monopolies on fishing and blocked foreign ships in their neighboring seas.  Mare clausum in the Age of Discovery During the Age of Discovery, between the 15th and 17th century, sailing that had been mostly coastal became oceanic. Thus, the main focus was on long-haul routes. Countries of the Iberian Peninsula were pioneers in this process, seeking exclusive property and exploration rights over lands discovered and to be discovered. Given the amount of new lands and the resulting influx of wealth, the Kingdom of Portugal and the united kingdoms of Castile and Aragon began to compete openly. To avoid hostilities, they resorted to secrecy and diplomacy, marked by the signing of the Treaty of Alc√°√ßovas in 1479 and the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494. Iberian 'mare clausum' in the Age of Discovery. The papacy helped legitimize and strengthen these claims, since Pope Nicholas V by the bull Romanus Pontifex of 1455 prohibited others to navigate the seas under the Portuguese exclusive without permission of the king of Portugal. The very titling of Portuguese kings announced this claim to the seas: \\"King of Portugal and the Algarves, within and beyond the sea in Africa, Lord of Commerce, Conquest and Shipping of Arabia, Persia and India\\". With the discovery of sea route to India and later the route of Manila the concept of \\"Mare clausum\\" in the treaty was realized. This policy was refused by European nations like France, Holland and England, who were then barred from expanding and trading, and engaged in privateering and piracy of routes, products and colonies. In the 16th and 17th century Spain considered the Pacific Ocean a Mare clausum ‚Äì a sea closed to other naval powers. As the only known entrance from the Atlantic, the Strait of Magellan was at times patrolled by fleets sent to prevent entrance of non-Spanish ships. On the western end of the Pacific Ocean the Dutch threatened the Spanish Philippines.  Mare clausum versus Mare liberum  In February 1603 the seizing of 1500-ton loaded Portuguese Santa Catarina by the Dutch East India Company led to scandal with a public judicial hearing and a campaign to sway public (and international) opinion. The representatives of the Company then called Hugo Grotius, a jurist of the Dutch Republic, to draft a defence of the seizure.See Ittersum (2006), chapter 1. In 1609 Hugo Grotius sought to ground his defense of the seizure in terms of the natural principles of justice; Grotius formulated a new principle that the sea was international territory and all nations were free to use it for seafaring trade. One chapter of his long theory-laden treatise entitled De Jure Pr√¶d√¶ made it to the press in the form of the influential pamphlet, Mare Liberum (The Free Sea). In it Grotius, by claiming 'free seas', provided suitable ideological justification for the Dutch breaking up of various trade monopolies through its formidable naval power (and then establishing its own monopoly). Reaction followed. In 1625 Portuguese priest Serafim de Freitas published the book De Iusto Imperio Lusitanorum Asiatico (Of the just Portuguese Asian Empire) addressing step by step the arguments of the Dutch.Freitas, Frei Serafim de, Do Justo Imp√©rio Asi√°tico dos Portugueses. Freitas, Frei Serafim de, Just Do the Portuguese Asian empire. De Iusto Imperio Lusitanorum Asiatico, 2 vols. (in Portuguese) Despite his arguments, the international situation demanded an end to the Mare clausum policy, and freedom of the seas as an essential condition for the development of maritime trade.Ant√≥nio Costa Canas, \\"Mare Clausum\\", 2003, in Portuguese England, competing fiercely with the Dutch for domination of world trade, opposed Grotius' ideas and claimed sovereignty over the waters around the British Isles. In Mare clausum (1635) John Selden coined the term, endeavoring to prove that the sea was in practice virtually as capable of appropriation as terrestrial territory. As conflicting claims grew out of the controversy, maritime states came to moderate their demands and base their maritime claims on the principle that it extended seawards from land. A workable formula was found by Cornelius Bynkershoek in his De dominio maris (1702), restricting maritime dominion to the actual distance within which cannon range could effectively protect it. This became universally adopted and developed into the three-mile limit.

Issiglio borders the following municipalities: Castellamonte, Alice Superiore, Rueglio, Vistrorio, and Vidracco.  History  The most reliable researcher in the history of Canavese is certainly the Bertolotti who in the second half of the nineteenth century wrote that the current name of Issiglio does not have a sure origin, but there are more versions. A first version wants to derive from the ancient pagan cult that was celebrated in a small temple of the country dedicated to a goddess protector of the countryside: it is not known, however, whether it was the goddess Isis or Isi, deity received from Egypt or the nereide Isea or the goddess Isis, protector of wool mills. This temple was later transformed into a church and was a parish for the towns of Issiglio and Vidracco up to 1693 and still exists near the cemetery. A second version wants him to derive from In Exilio for being the place of deportation of Roman prisoners who had to work in the mines of the Valley. A third version holds that it derives from Isily, from the Gallic Isiliacum, used to mean place along running waters. Certain historical facts are known only towards the end of the 1300s: the Village is mentioned in the toll exemptions for the Val di Chy, (which included all the countries of the orographic right of Chiusella) and in the documents of the various feudal lords who owned it. the San Martino di Strambino, the Arundello, the Parella, the Loranz√®, the San Martino di Agli√® and the Bishops of Ivrea. Until the end of the nineteenth century the village was not served by driveways, it communicated only through paths with Rueglio, Muriaglio, Vidracco and Vistrorio, which was the chief mandate of all the villages of the Bassa Valle starting from Rueglio, and that was only reachable through a walkway of wooden planks laid on the stones of the Chiusella torrent in the border area between Vistrorio and Gauna and then with the In the second half of the nineteenth century the inhabitants were 775 distributed in less than 200 families. The lower part of the town was in ancient times certainly flooded: from this was born the legend that tells then that the country was much higher, near the current Sardus village and that on the opposite bank the Prince of Arundello fell in love with a poor peasant Issigliese. He managed to drain the lake to win his mother's opposition to the wedding. The ancient economy of the country was based on breeding, agriculture and craft trades. With the forestation, in addition to solving the problem of heating, it was provided to the dwelling and furnishings. The houses were almost exclusively built of wood and stone, which were raw materials that were found on site. There is also evidence of the existence of two lime kilns and one of bricks, as in the absence of roads external supplies were quite difficult. The houses stood on the territory wherever there was the slightest possibility of agricultural activities, since they had to be adjusted with what was available. Often the craft became so refined up to be a real art as evidenced by some still existing architectural features, for example, A similar symbiosis between practical functionality and aesthetic peculiarity can also be found in stone arches and, in some less modernized buildings, in brick or wooden ceilings.  Nature and Landscape of Issiglio  Visit to the ancient aqueduct Until the 1960s, the town of Issiglio had no drinking water in the houses, but was only equipped with five drinking fountains, three of which with a watering hole for livestock. The water came from a derivation of the Savenca torrent with an open-air conduit with discharge openings on its path to divert it into the torrent if necessary, such as work on the pipeline or on the loading tank or with earthy residues following thunderstorms. The first section of the pipeline was occasionally filled with coal, which was used for filtering-water litteration. The loading tank or reservoir placed at an altitude that could serve all the fountains located in the concentric with very little descent and therefore with little pressure was buried in the ground with overlying building, The vaulted building with full bricks is of all merit, as was the iron access door that was stolen. Of this aqueduct (which went into disuse with the arrival of the present at the beginning of the Sixties), the date of its construction is unknown, even the older ones remember it already existing since their youth, for which it is only possible to hypothesize that was done in the second half of the nineteenth century. The distance to be covered is about one kilometer on an easy and flat path consisting of a dirt road that only narrows along the path. The departure is from the junction between Via Marconi and Via Sale and continues between the narrow of two old villas. The mountain rock dominates the villas on the left and our road, even if an impervious stony path attacks it departing to reach the reservoir tanks of the current aqueduct whose water comes from two sides. From the right comes the withdrawal of the sources that feed the consortium of the six municipalities of the Lower Valchiusella: Rueglio, Alice, Pecco, Lugnacco, Vistrorio and Issiglio located in the area of Bossola and called Fiaut, Cassa, Marciana and Rosone, of which only the last one is on the south side while the other ones are on the north side. A branch of this aqueduct of part in proximity of the old Bridge of Rueglio and through the Lavesso hill and our region Sendola passing the Savenca along a shoulder of the bridge with round trip through the road we cross, and up the mountain up to the two pools that overlook us at an altitude just under six hundred meters, serving as a reserve for the distribution of drinking to the concentric and suburban villages. The other arrival channel has arisen with two purposes; the first is due to the lack of supply of the consortium of the aqueduct, both for errors in assessing the flow rates of the sources and for the increase in consumption. Second motivation is to serve the population spread on the ridge towards Castelnuovo Nigra, resident at an altitude above the loading tanks. consortium aqueduct, both for errors in the assessment of the flow rates of the sources and for the increase in consumption. Second motivation is to serve the population spread on the ridge towards Castelnuovo Nigra, resident at an altitude above the loading tanks. consortium aqueduct, both for errors in the assessment of the flow rates of the sources and for the increase in consumption. Second motivation is to serve the population spread on the ridge towards Castelnuovo Nigra, resident at an altitude above the loading tanks. This last aqueduct, built solely for the service of our territory, collects the small springs of our municipal assets: Moia Rotonda, C√®re and Flussa plus the Sorgenti Cercer in the municipality of Castelnuovo Nigra. In addition to serving almost all of our high hamlets and scattered farmhouses it covers most of all the needs of our country. Leaving aside the news of our current aqueduct, we continue our journey by observing on the right the course of our stream that we will follow in parallel, only separated in this first stretch from the irrigation channel that flows lower down. Beyond the Savenca we see our plain of Sendola - now full of new houses built among the old farmsteads-, whose inhabitants cultivated it in the past and still today in gardens and orchards still has the best meadows of the village and is the base of the Lavesso hill, on which there are some houses, is now abandoned and the wooded carpet expands increasingly. Only its tip (which we call the M√®c or Monte Sinai and the Ruegliesi to which it belongs, the Urget), is still kept alive, even if for some time the friars who were said to have built the housing complex surrounded by a great wall of dry stone, which remains intact. Further on we come to the confluence of the Rio Madone with the Savenca that descends rather steeply with pleasant little waterfalls. Then the small and flat collection of the Stantera which presents a curiosity of borders between municipalities, Meanwhile, we have reached the tank of the old aqueduct and we can observe its width for the rise of the ground with the small building still intact over time with the special vault and in the center the hatch with the circular stone lid, we can still see the traces of the old adduction channel. The gold mine Still starting from the building of the ancient aqueduct, we now return to the \\"old\\" paths of Valfosca. Here a draft of auriferous extraction of some veins was attempted. The path that connects us is as short as it is steep. It worked a couple of years between 1876 and 1877 with unsatisfactory economic results. We are fortunate enough to have a copy of the payroll of the workers at the time. We can not say instead of the length of the gallery because it does not appear that someone has had the courage to inspect it. However, seeing its entrance, one can understand that the attempt to search for the precious metal was done at least on two levels before abandoning it. The workers hired for the realization of this activities ranged from 10 to 14 managed by an assistant who was paid monthly with a pay of 100 pounds, those of the workers did not exceed 1 - 2 lire pro die. The dealer of the mine was a certain Bertino di Settimo Tavagnasco. This is the tangible evidence that the valley of the Savenca has various mineral qualitiDes, already noted by the Romans.  The Church of San Pietro  The church was built around the year one thousand, as attested by the antiquity of its architecture, the Romanesque apse decorated with hanging arches, partly concealed today by a funeral construction built next to the building. Until 1696 it was also a parish church for the nearby municipality of Vidracco. With the separation of the two parishes, it was decided to build a new church in Issiglio that preserved the dedication to Saint Peter in bonds. Since then the church has maintained only the function of cemetery chapel. The church is a single room, with an apse facing east, covered by a trussed roof, left in a state of great decay for many years, has recently been restored with the complete rebuilding of the roof and the restoration of the load-bearing walls. An unprecedented cycle of fifteenth century Gothic frescoes has been discovered in the church since 2008.  Description of the Church Site  The cycle of AFFRESCHI is large and of a certain iconographic complexity, even if for some parts it is not in good conditions and with large areas of lack. The affected portions are apse, triumphal arch and attached walls, and the right side of the church. The triumphal arch is painted in alternating gray and red segments and surrounded by a decorative motif that recalls bird plumage and which contains the frescoed parts; in the side walls, one on each side, the figures of the angel and the Madonna: the latter, better preserved, with hands on the chest, is reached by the dove of the Holy Spirit above rays of light, while reading, laid on an inclined plane, the book of Isaiah. At the center of the arch, within another decorated cornice, no longer visible due to falling plaster, perhaps a head of the Eternal Father. In the lower registers of the walls, on the left the fresco is almost illegible, on the right is a figure of a blessing bishop, probably of San Dionigi; there, at the top, a curious little black image of a devil. The intrados of the apse arch houses, within shielded frames, a series of portraits, only partially visible, but very expressive, in fifteenth-century dresses, probably prophets and sibyls; the basin shows pictorial fragments that can be interpreted as the symbols of the four Evangelists (Tetramorfo), in a rough rocky landscape, and in the center a lacunose Maiestas Domini. On the left a kneeling female figure, probably still a Virgin, and on the right a fragment of a figure. In the lower part, in the center, the wood of the cross with the canonical inscription, which could be the background of a Piet√†. The portion still below carries the traces of the apostles placed in a semicircle, and is partly still hidden by the altar placed there in the following centuries. In the side wall of the hall it is visible, always within a large decorative frame of the same shape as that of the triumphal arch, a large scene, depicting a Madonna of Mercy with the mantle supported by two angels: under the mantle, in two registers superimposed, there are many characters, left male and female right. The two upper ranks house saints and saints, the lower ones pope, cardinal, lords, men and women religious, that is to say the representatives of the earthly hierarchies. Remarkable iconographic peculiarity is the fact that the Virgin of Mercy is depicted on a throne, with the Child in his arms and that the two registers depict dead figures and, below, alive, but with a skull at the center to indicate the transience of life. On the left of this scene is still visible the image of St. Peter bishop, owner of the building, sitting on a bench and with the attribute of the keys. It is a cycle of considerable stylistic level and of great interest, also iconographic, with overabundance of elegant cartouches, sometimes furnished with a colored initial. Substantial are still the stylistic and thematic references to the world of Jaquerian frescoes with other aspects that recall certain visible developments in the Novarese painting, as shown by the general structure and certain details such as the seated Virgin, with a polygonal perspective base (cycles of Novara or Casalvolone). But the most direct stylistic reference is with the cycle discovered in the summer of 2007 in the parish church of San Giovanni di Torre Canavese. The cycle that seems possible, at least temporarily, to date to the second half of the fifteenth century, after that of Torre, that the interpretation of a writing is still fragmentary.

Examples in organisms Lateral communication in organisms or animals can give rise to collective intelligence, or the appearance of collective intelligence. Examples of lateral communication in organisms include: * The participants in a flock of birds or a shoal of fish all maintain their relative positions or alter direction simultaneously due to lateral communication. * Ants, termites and bees coordinate by lateral communication, mediated in the case of ants and termites, for example, by scent trails. The resulting physical structure is an emergent property of the individual entities. * Bacterial colonies communicate with each other, coordinating, for example, an attack, or the production of slime using lateral communication based on chemical messengers so that as a group they can detect how many colleagues are near and whether they are likely to overwhelm a target. * The pacemaker cells in the heart, a cardiac pacemaker form a small group; lateral communications sweep through the cells, much like a Mexican wave as a three-dimensional circulating wave, which relays contraction signals to the whole heart. * With slime mold, millions of individual amoeba-like creatures can spread out and graze the surface of a leaf. When conditions change, the amoeba concentrate and form a slug-like creature that can relocate before forming a spore body and releasing individual spores. *The position and type of human cells are mediated by lateral communication. *Meaning:-Lateral communication involves communication across chains of command. It facilitates coordination among departments. It probably takes place because people prefer the informality of lateral communication to the formal downward and upward communication. Those actively involved in lateral communication are called ‚Äúboundary spanners.‚Äù Since ‚Äúboundary spanning,‚Äù allows for accumulation of vast amounts of information, such persons wield tremendous power and enjoy greater status by filtering and communicating with others. Organizations and communities Communities communicate and store collective knowledge through lateral communication and is an essential ingredient in making hierarchies work, by compensating for errors in vertical information flows. In an organization, lateral communication is communication between different individuals/departments at the same organizational level. The term lateral communication can be used interchangeably with horizontal communication. In his text entitled Organizational Communication, Michael J. Papa defines horizontal communication as \\"the flow of messages across functional areas at a given level of an organization\\". People at the same level \\"communicate directly without going through several levels of organization\\". Given this elasticity, members of an organization have an easier time with \\"problem- solving, information sharing across different work groups, and task coordination between departments or project teams\\". The use of lateral or horizontal communication in the workplace \\"can also enhance morale and afford a means of resolving conflicts. Other research asserted, \\"lateral communication involves not only the movement of information from the upper levels to the lower levels of the organizational hierarchy but also is defined primarily as the quality of information sharing among peers at similar levels. Specifically, lateral communication occurs among coworkers, during staff meetings and informational presentations, throughout shift changes, and among employees regardless of peer types. In short, lateral communication's purpose is to keep organizational personnel informed of all current practices, policies, and procedures\\". \\"Communicating effectively laterally involves the exchange of information between and among all organizational members. While we may perceive that organizational information flows vertically or from top to bottom, in reality, information moves laterally. In other words, as information directives are communicated from an upper to a lower position on the hierarchy, peers at each hierarchical level should quickly interpret and communicate these directives between and among peers at similar hierarchical levels. Thus, it is critical for an organization to understand its structure and culture, which are the two major determinants of the quality of lateral communication.\\". Quality: structure and culture Structure * Mechanistic structure ‚Äì \\"A mechanistic or hierarchical organizational structure emphasizes specialization in position. Examples include healthcare and governmental organizations where information is communicated based on a chain of command. This organizational structure type is not conducive to lateral communication and, in fact, discourages it. Since direction and coordination are achieved through upper hierarchical levels, peer information sharing is limited. Overall, a mechanistic structure promotes vertical communication or top-down communication with strict alignment and unity of command within the organization\\". * Organic structure ‚Äì \\"An organic organizational structure is built upon an entrepreneurial concept. Here, the decisions made are decentralized and coordinated by mutual adjustment rather than command and control. Examples include a small business or a manufacturing facility where communication is promoted at all levels of the organization. This organizational structure allows for greater autonomy, promotes individual initiative, and allows employees to be involved in the decision-making process thus enabling employee decision-making to contribute to or detract from organizational goals. In short, an organic organizational structure can encourage and facilitate lateral communication\\". Culture/climate \\"Organizational culture refers to the organization's shared visions, values, beliefs, goals, and practices (Gilsdorf, 1998). Deals and Kennedy (1982) have connected culture with effective communication. Strong cultures and effective communication result in employees who are more productive because they know exactly what is expected of them in organizational settings. Gilsdorf (1998) has implied that the more employees perceive a positive or strong organizational culture, the more productive they will be. Poole (1985) has contended that an organization's quality of communication is summed-up in its culture. In many cases, a strong positive organizational culture or climate can encourage employees to communicate effectively laterally when sharing achievements and disappointments. Thus, as Comer (1991) has asserted, managers should actively encourage employees to communicate effectively laterally with their peers. In sum, lateral communication allows for a spirit of collaboration and teamwork by empowering employees at every level of the organizational hierarchy to work effectively together (see, for example, Thamara, 2000)\\".Lateral communication involves communication across chains of command.

Challenges Although laterl communication can be effective, according to Papa, \\"horizontal communication problems occur because of territoriality, rivalry, specialization, and simple lack of motivation.\\" In addition to these problems and in general, \\"organizations that traditionally have functioned under rigid authority structures with fixed lines of communication may find that the values and expectations that members have acquired under such systems inhibit attempts at horizontal communication.\\" Other problems with this form of communication can happen between multinational corporations. \\"Horizontal communication between subsidiaries of the same multinational corporation (MNC) is a problem faced by staff as the demands for communicating across borders are pushed downwards in the organizational hierarchy.\\". Territoriality Territoriality often occurs when members of an organization \\"control task-related activity within a defined and fixed jurisdictional area\\" and as a result \\"regard others' involvement in that area as territorial encroachment.\\" \\"Departments value their turf and strive to protect it. This problem may be compounded by interdepartmental rivalries that arise from win/lose the competition for rewards and resources\\" Rivalry Rivalry within organizations occurs for example when different groups at a given organization level fail to cooperate. For example, Papa gives an example of \\"corporate executives in a national department store chain\\" who \\"encountered territorial rivalry when they discovered that local stores within each of the company's major sales districts refused to cooperate with one another on sales promotions\\". \\"Stores within the same sales region literally were in competition with one another as well as with other department store chains\\" Specialization Specialization can inhibit communication when organizations do not have uniformity within departments. Specialization can occur within procedures or jargon used by different departments. For example, when \\"different specialties use the same terms in different ways\\", this can create confusion and miscommunication. When this occurs organizations have trouble functioning properly and do not run smoothly. Motivation \\"Horizontal communication often fails simply because organization members are unwilling to expend the additional effort that it requires.\\" \\"Horizontal communication may require contact with people in units that are well removed from our own.

It was nominally in effect from 1869 to 1878 during the Ten Years' War against Spain, the first of a series of conflicts that led to Cuban independence in 1898. Background On 10 October 1868, a group in Oriente Province led by sugar planter and mill owner Carlos Manuel de C√©spedes proclaimed Cuba's independence from Spain, launching a decade of hostilities known as the Ten Years' War. He assumed the title of captain general and ruled a small independent area in the style of a Spanish colonial governor. A second group of rebels, Havana students from prominent families, had formed their own Revolutionary Committee and rejected both C√©spedes' conservativism and his claim to lead the insurgency which, in their view, he had launched precipitously in order to assume its leadership. They assembled in Camag√ºey Province in December. Political idealists, they were led by Ignacio Agramonte, a young lawyer with radical liberal views. He said: \\"We Camag√ºeyans are determined not to depend ever on any dictatorship whatsoever, nor to follow in the footsteps of the first authority of the Eastern [Oriente] department.\\" The Revolutionary Committee announced that in the area it controlled \\"the military power is subordinated to the civil power, and the authority of the latter is limited by the rights of the people.\\" Though engaged in a military campaign, they mistrusted military authority, which they associated with martial law and dictatorship, as evidenced by regimes‚Äìall born of earlier independence movements decades earlier‚Äìin many Latin American countries, including Francisco Solano Lopez in Paraguay, Mariano Melgarejo in Bolivia, and Gabriel Garcia Moreno in Ecuador. A military defeat in January 1869 left C√©spedes without a territory under his control. In March a third rebel group announced its support of the Camag√ºeyans. To salvage his position C√©spedes agreed to a compromise. He relinquished his claim to military authority, accepted the position of president of the new republic, and agreed that the powers of that office would be defined by a constitution. Assembly of Gu√°imaro The Camag√ºeyans and those rebels who shared their political principles met on 10 April 1869, in Gu√°imaro, where in the course of a single day they wrote and adopted their governing document, the Gu√°imaro Constitution. Its principal authors were Agramonte and . It made no concession to C√©spedes' views. Its central feature was a unicameral legislature, a House of Representatives, that appointed the president and chief of the military, who both served at the pleasure of the legislature. In practice, the House never trusted President C√©spedes, who continued to issue military orders without regard for the military leadership appointed by the House. The House was hampered in taking action against C√©spedes by the military situation, which remained precarious and sometimes prevented the House from meeting. The war required local military leaders, even Agramonte when he took on a military role, to function as near dictators. As one historian assesses the constitutional experiment: The Gu√°imaro Constitution was in effect until 15 March 1878. On 1 July 1940, the delegates to the Constitutional Assembly that wrote and adopted a new Cuban Constitution in Havana, having completed their work on 8 June, assembled at the site where the Gu√°imaro Constitution had been adopted, a schoolhouse in Gu√°imaro, and signed their document on the same table used in 1869.

It is located about northwest of Turin at the mouth of the Valli di Lanzo. History Civic Tower of Aymone of Challant Lanzo is mentioned in the early 11th century as Curtis Lanceii. Later, under several names, was a fief (together with its namesake valleys) to the bishop of Turin, of the house of Savoy and of the Marquisate of Montferrat. In the mid-16th century the Castle of Lanzo, considered amongst the most important in Piedmont, was besieged, stormed (1551) and destroyed by French troops under Charles de Brissac (1551-52). Of the former fortifications, only the gate entrance of the town has remained to this day. After the Peace of Cateau-Cambr√©sis (1559), the town was returned to Duke Emmanuel Philibert of Savoy. After his death, Lanzo was assigned to his daughter Maria (1577), wife of Philip of Este. The Este government brought decline to Lanzo and its valleys, as it lost most of the previous privileges. In 1725 the fief went to Count Giuseppe Ottavio Cacherano Osasco della Rocca. In 1792, his family remained without an heir and Lanzo went to the Kingdom of Sardinia. In 1798, during the French Revolutionary Wars, Lanzo was first captured by the Austrians. After the battle of Marengo, it became the capital of a French arrondissement and, later, the district capital. After the 1815 Restoration, it followed the history of Piedmont and, from 1861, that of the newly unified Kingdom of Italy. In the 19th century, Lanzo changed from a mainly agricultural centre into a vacation seat for people from Turin, a trend spurred by the railway connection inaugurated in 1876. Also in this period, the first mechanical, textile and paper industries were established.

It rises at the village of Ringinglow, flowing east through Whirlow and Ecclesall Woods into Abbeydale in the Beauchief area, where it merges with the River Sheaf. Near this point part of the stream has been diverted to provide the goit for the Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet millpond, and this channel flows through what is now Beauchief Gardens.  History  On nearby Fulwood Lane a polished Neolithic stone axehead was found in 1952 indicating ancient human activity in the area. An interim report by University of Sheffield staff on excavations of a linear feature at Sheephill Farm, close to the brook has suggested evidence of the route of the lost Roman Road linking Templeborough with the Roman Signal Station at Navio (Brough-on-Noe) and Batham Gate. The feature, which extends through Barber Fields is 20m wide and filled to a depth of 5m with rubble and has a metalled surface. The route of the Roman Road would have passed close to the Roman Villa known to have existed at nearby Whirlow Hall Farm. Limb Brook lies entirely within the City of Sheffield boundaries, but used to form (with the connecting River Sheaf and Meers Brook) part of the border between Yorkshire and Derbyshire. This boundary dates back to the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria. Sidney Oldall Addy, in his 1888 book on the Sheffield dialect mentions that this stream is called Fenny Brook on the Ordnance Survey map, where it flows past Ringinglow. (transcribed at wikisource)Sidney Oldall Addy's 1888 map, used to illustrate his book on the Sheffield dialect. Limb Brook is shown as Fenny Brook. The Ringinglow Inn is now known as the Norfolk Arms. The brook has long been used as a source of power for local industry; remains of water-powered mills used variously for smelting lead and grinding corn can be seen at Whirlow Wheel and Ryecroft Mill in Ecclesall Woods. Historical evidence of shallow coal drift-mining of the Ringinglow seam which lies on top of the Chatsworth Grit has been found in the Barber Fields area. The workings extended beneath the watercourse. Stratigraphically this was the lowest coal seam ever worked in the Sheffield area. The mine was served by a short railway which, along with the mine is no more. All that remains is a spoil-heap on the North bank of the brook. The mine is one of the few known examples of a shallow drift to have been worked by a small number of men in the Sheffield area. Close to the drift-mine was a copperas works. This was disused by 1877. Today, the brook no longer supports any industry, but with the woodlands of the Limb valley provides a valuable recreational resource for the inhabitants of Sheffield. It is owned and administered by the city council's recreation department, who maintain the area for the benefit of wildlife and the public. Sheffield Round Walk follows almost the entire route of the Limb brook, from Abbeydale Road South to Ringinglow.  Flora and fauna  Limb Brook rises in a sphagnum moss bog by the side of Ringinglow Road and then flows through Lady Canning's Plantation, a coniferous woodland, managed by Sheffield City Council Parks and Countryside Service. It then flows slowly through farmland, where it provides an environment for reeds and sedges. As it descends into the Limb valley and down through Ecclesall Woods, it is surrounded by steep hillsides which support mature woodland, including Beech, Sycamore, Alder, Ash and Hazel. This is a rich environment for invertebrates and many birds and mammals, including kingfishers and water voles. The rare white-clawed crayfish has also been seen.

Career Clarence Coleman was born in Orlando, Florida on August 25, 1937. He signed as an undrafted free agent with the Washington Senators at age 18. He was released by the Senators and signed by the Los Angeles Dodgers, then taken by the Philadelphia Phillies in the rule V draft. In 1961, he appeared in 34 games for the Phillies, getting hit by a pitch in his first Major League plate appearance. He batted only .128 for the Phillies that year in 47 at bats. The Phillies finished in last place that year, a spot soon to be taken by the expansion New York Mets. In the offseason the Mets selected Coleman in the expansion draft. He played parts of three seasons for the Mets, hitting .205 in 415 at bats. The authors of The Great American Baseball Card Flipping, Trading and Bubble Gum Book, Brendan C. Boyd & Fred C. Harris, Little Brown & Co, 1973, had this to say about Coleman on p. 37, next to a picture of his baseball card: \\"Choo- Choo Coleman was the quintessence of the early New York Mets.

After baseball Upon retirement, Coleman moved back to his home town of Orlando. After his first wife died, Coleman married into a family who owned a Chinese restaurant in Newport News, Virginia. For over two decades, Coleman helped run the business and occasionally worked as a cook. Coleman eventually retired to Bamberg, South Carolina where he lived in obscurity until 2012 when he was invited to the Mets 50th anniversary celebration in New York.

Its duration and intensity distinguished it from other Gulag rebellions during the same period (see Vorkuta uprising). After the murder of some of their fellow prisoners by guards, Kengir inmates rebelled and seized the entire camp compound, holding it for weeks and creating a period of freedom for themselves unique in the history of the Gulag. After a rare alliance between the criminals and political prisoners, the prisoners succeeded in forcing the guards and camp administration to flee the camp and effectively quarantine it from the outside. The prisoners thereafter built intricate defenses to prevent the incursion of the authorities into their newly won territory. This situation lasted for an unprecedented length of time and resulted in novel activity, including the formation of a provisional government by the prisoners, prisoner marriages, the performance of religious ceremonies, and the waging of a propaganda campaign against the erstwhile authorities. After 40 days of freedom within the camp walls, intermittent negotiation, and mutual preparation for violent conflict, the rebellion was suppressed by Soviet armed forces with tanks and guns on the morning of 26 June.–û–±—Ä–∞—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∫–æ–º–∏—Å—Å–∏–∏ –ú–í–î –°–°–°–† –∫ –∑–∞–∫–ª—é—á–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–º 3-–≥–æ –ª–∞–≥–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–≥–æ –æ—Ç–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è. 26 –∏—é–Ω—è 1954 –≥. According to former prisoners, five hundred to seven hundred people were killed or wounded by the suppression, although official figures claim only a few dozen had been killed. The story of the rebellion was first committed to history in The Gulag Archipelago, a work by former prisoner and Nobel Prize-winning Russian author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.  Background   Changes in the Gulag  A group of political prisoners in Kengir (1949‚Äì1956). A year before the rebellion, the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin died. His death aroused great hopes among the prisoners of amnesty or at least prison reform, and this hope was further emboldened by the subsequent arrest of Stalin's former state security chief, Lavrenty Beria. Beria, who was the chief of the entire Soviet security and police apparatus and architect of some of the most hated policies relating to the camps, was declared an \\"enemy of the people\\" and executed by those who succeeded Stalin. Beria's newly discredited name became a liability to others in both the upper and lower echelons of the Soviet hierarchy, and anybody who had been associated with or spoken too much in favour of Beria was similarly at risk of being denounced as a traitor and persecuted. The camp administration were not excluded from this risk, and this fact weakened their authority vis √† vis the prisoners. Writing about the strikes which were occurring at the time, Solzhenitsyn described this issue: Prisoners all over the Gulag, for this reason and others, were becoming increasingly bold and impudent during the months preceding the rebellion, with hunger strikes, work stoppages, large-scale insubordination, and punitive violence becoming more and more common. In Kengir in particular, camp authorities were rapidly losing control of their charges, and the communiqu√©s periodically sent by commanders up the camp hierarchy, in which they expressed their dismay at the frequent incidents of unrest, powerful underground organizations, the growing \\"crisis\\" afflicting their network of informants, and their desperate attempts to reassert control, attest to this.  Kengir  = Thieves = The rebellion's causes can be traced back to a large arrival of \\"thieves\\" ‚Äî the accepted slang term for the habitual criminals who were also imprisoned in Gulag along with the political prisoners. Traditionally, thieves and politicals had been antagonists, with the thieves exercising virtually unchecked dominance over the politicals, robbing and abusing them at will, and with the politicals remaining too disunited to muster a credible defense. This situation was facilitated by a variably complacent or actively encouraging camp administration, which recognized the value of discouraging the thieves and politicals from uniting with a common cause. Indeed, the infusion of about 650 thieves into the approximately 5,200-strong body of political prisoners at Kengir at the beginning of May was specifically for this purpose, as the Kengir prisoners had organized strikes before on a smaller scale and were becoming increasingly restless. The camp authorities hoped that these thieves would, as they had in the past, help reverse this trend.Solzhenitsyn p. 290. =Informers= While the Gulag labour camps were established during the early 1920s, only during the early 1950s were the politicals and 'thieves' finally separated into different camp systems. With the thieves absent, the politicals began to unite in ways unprecedented in Gulag camps. The inmates organized as national, religious, and ethnic groups (Ukrainians, Kazakhs, Chechens, Armenians, Latvians, Estonians, Lithuanians, Muslims, Christians, etc.) and began murdering camp informers or prisoners who otherwise colluded with the camp administration. The informers had kept their identities secret and denounced fellow prisoners, causing them to distrust each other, but the national and ethnic groups killed so many of them that the remaining, unidentified informers fled to the camp administration for protection.Solzhenitsyn, Part V, Chapter 11 = Weaponry and organization = Of these above-mentioned ethnic blocs, the Ukrainians, many of whom were exiled members of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (by some estimates comprising more than half of the camps' population) were the most important, and they quickly asserted a commanding role among the prisoners. Members of this \\"Ukrainian Centre\\", as it was often called, were the primary proponents killing informers and later would prove essential to dealing with the newly arrived thieves.Applebaum, p. 496. Along with this effective elimination of informers, the prisoners began fashioning shivs, which were previously the exclusive possession of thieves. In addition, many incidents occurred (usually including the wanton murder of some well-liked prisoner by guards) during the previous months that came to increase resentment and justify extreme action on behalf of the prisoners. Protests and collective refusals to work were increasing in frequency and the prisoners were learning how to plan and maintain large-scale disturbances, mainly by creating systems of communication between camp divisions and establishing command hierarchies. Into this changed situation the thieves were injected and, to the surprise of the camp authorities, they joined forces with the politicals, meeting secretly on the first night with the Ukrainian Centre and establishing a pact.Applebaum, p. 497. This was due both to the fact that they recognized their odds against the almost 5,200 strong body of well-armed and united political prisoners, and because thieves across the whole Gulag had learned of the politicals' campaign against the informers and began to respect them for it. = The camp compound = The entire Kengir camp complex formed a large rectangle, divided width-wise into four distinct areas: the women's camp, the \\"service yard\\", where all the workshops and storerooms were located, and two camps for men, each with its own jailhouse for punishing prisoners or hiding informers. The women's camp was blocked off both from access and sight to the men's camp.  Seizing of the camp  The formative stage of the rebellion began on the evening of 16 May, a Sunday and thus a day of rest for all the prisoners. The thieves contrived to break into the service yard, where the food was stored, and from there break into the women's camp, which was easier to do from that location. This they did initially, but they were soon chased away by guards. At nightfall, though, the thieves regrouped, shot out all of the lights in range with their slingshots, and broke through the barrier between the men's camp and service yard with an improvised battering ram.Solzhenitsyn, p. 293. It was at this timee the Kengir rebellion proper started when the guards began shooting at the thieves, killing 13 and wounding 43. The remaining thieves retreated and an uneasy peace followed. During the night, though, thieves, now joined by the politicals, started breaking up their bunks and cells, trying to add to their cache of shivs and arm those without weapons, while the camp authorities posted machine gunners at the hole in the wall. After a tense standoff, the camp authorities, in a surprise gesture, ordered the withdrawal of all guards from the compound. This was actually a tactical response by the authorities. The next day they feigned acquiescence to the prisoners' demands and, while the prisoners then agreeably went to work outside the camp, the guards busied themselves repairing the broken-down wall. Nevertheless, this was arguably an error on their part because it exposed the bad faith of the guards and eliminated all remaining trust the prisoners had in their word. More importantly, though, the prisoners had, for one whole day, had total freedom (within the confines of the camp compound), mingling freely with the female prisoners, eating their fill, and fraternizing as they pleased, and this put in them a desire for freedom that would not be so easily quenched.Solzhenitsyn, p. 296. During this time the first propaganda about the rebellion was released by the camp authorities (they re-enacted, in full prisoner costume, the alleged rape of the women prisoners and photographed themselves, releasing the photographs and declaring that the revolt was in fact a disguise for debauchery and hedonism). When the prisoners became aware of these tricks, they reasserted themselves, sending the guards fleeing from the camp again. They then proceeded to re-destroy the wall that had just been repaired and release the prisoners from the camp's solitary confinement cells. The camp had been seized and would remain in the control of the prisoners for the next 40 days.  The new camp society   Culture  With the entire camp at their disposal, and with feelings of fellowship and good-will in abundance, prisoners began to enjoy some of the joys of normal life which had been denied to them. As Solzhenitsyn and others retold, men and women from different camp divisions who had romantically conversed secretly for years, but had never seen each other, finally met.Solzhenitsyn, p. 297. Imprisoned priests presided over a number of improvised weddings. Prisoners retrieved what remained of their civilian clothing from the storeroom (the guards regularly stole and sold prisoners' items), and soon prisoners were seen adorned with fur coats and assorted colourful clothing, in addition to the religious wear that had been banned. Business, as well, resumed as best it could, with one Russian aristocrat opening a \\"caf√©\\" serving ersatz \\"coffee\\", which proved to be quite popular with the prisoners.Applebaum, p. 501. Soon a number of organized recreational activities began. Because of the large number of political prisoners in Gulag, almost every camp had a selection of engineers, scientists, intellectuals, and artists, who gave lectures to other inmates. Poetry recitals and even hastily prepared plays were performed. Hymns, composed by the Ukrainians, were performed en masse. One hymn in particular, with its simultaneously mournful and celebratory theme and its demand for freedom, is a good example of the prevailing themes in the works produced during the rebellion: In addition to the renewed presence of religious regalia, religious practices were also given new life. Notably, one of the religious sects massed at the original hole broken into the dividing wall on the first night of the rebellion, claiming that their prophet had predicted its destruction and the freedom that followed. They, according to former prisoners, then sat on mattresses for several days by the hole, praying and waiting to be taken to heaven.  Government  Soon after the camp was captured, the prisoners congregated in the mess hall and decided to elect a commander, and a former Red Army Lieutenant colonel, Kapiton Kuznetsov, was chosen. A major reason for this choice was that the Ukrainian Center insisted on having Russian command of the rebellion and, indeed, on having the entire government be as multiethnic and multinational as possible. This was done mainly to avoid the appearance of the rebellion being anti-Russian in character, but also as an attempt to create a harmonious camp society and government.Applebaum, p. 498. Kuznetsov and his administration were originally delegated to perform negotiations with the camp authorities on behalf of the prisoners, but as the prisoners' control of the camp lasted beyond expectation and as demand for law, order, and efficiency increased, the jurisdiction of this government increased. Therefore, various departments were quickly created:Solzhenitsyn, p. 304. * Agitation and Propaganda. * Services and Maintenance (laundry, shoe and clothing repair, haircuts and shaves, and other services typical to the camp were continued throughout on a volunteer basis). * Food (their food stores, at the rate they were rationed, could have lasted many months). * Internal Security (some prisoners, who were pleading with others to surrender to the (original) camp authorities, were put into the camp jail). * Defence (Military). * Technical Department (staffed by the engineers, scientists, and other professionals imprisoned in the camp). = Propaganda = The first expansion of the government's authority came as a natural extension of its role as representative of the prisoners: propaganda. A theme was carefully set by Kuznetsov and taken over by his deputy, Yuriy Knopmus. The theme crucially undercut the main argument that would have been used by the camp authorities to end the rebellion, which was that the rebellion was anti-Soviet in nature. Instead, Knopmus schemed to portray the guards as \\"Beria-ites\\" (a risky charge at the time) and the rebellion as a patriotic action against them. Soon placards were raised declaring such sentiments as \\"Long live the Soviet constitution!\\" and \\"Down with murdering Beria-ites!\\"Solzhenitsyn, p. 303. As the new state of affairs continued, the Propaganda department's activities grew. At first they were all largely defensive in intent ‚Äî literally just responding to allegations hurled at them across the fence. The guards broadcast propaganda by loudspeaker into the camp, urging surrender and decrying the loss of days of valuable prison labor and the alleged detrimental effect it was having on the Soviet economy. In response, the prisoners, using a modified loudspeaker, broadcast back a whole set of mock radio programmes, complete with comedy programs and skits, written by the Agitation and Propaganda department and announced by a charismatic female prisoner.Solzhenitsyn, p. 317. One of the guard's stenographers recorded some of the broadcasts, and these records made their way into the Soviet archives. An excerpt of one broadcast: Later, with the help of the Technical Department, their schemes became increasingly ambitious. The prisoners, realizing the precariousness of their situation, endeavored to publicize their rebellion and demands to the village adjacent to the camp, hoping to incite its citizens to assist them. To do this, they first employed specially rigged, hot air balloons with slogans written on them (these were shot down by the guards) and, later, kites manufactured by the Chechens, who turned out to be kite specialists. The kites were successful for a time. During favorable winds, they dropped packets of leaflets to the settlements below, but the authorities soon sent up kites to tangle the prisoners' kite's lines.Solzhenitsyn, p. 319. Evemtually the prisoners fixed leaflets to carrier pigeons, releasing dozens into the air.Applebaum, p. 503. = Defense = Along with propaganda, defense came to the fore of the new government's list of priorities. Before the exiled camp authorities stopped the camp's electricity, the smiths and machinists (lathe-operators) in the camp fashioned all manner of weaponry in the service yard's workshops ‚Äî long pikes from prison bars, sabers, staves, and clubs amongst them.Applebaum, p. 490. In addition to this, the prisoners ground glass into dust and placed buckets of this dust throughout the camp, hoping to blind oncoming troops with it.Solzhenitsyn, p. 305. Barricades were established in important places, and responsibility for manning them was divided amongst the camp barracks (renamed \\"detachments\\" by the Defense department), with set shifts and procedures. The Technical Department contributed to this effort as well, namely by creating improvised explosive devices and incendiary bombs, both of which, according to Solzhenitsyn, were used during the actual invasion in June, the latter bringing down a guard tower.Solzhenitsyn, p. 327. = Technical Department = In addition to the above-mentioned innovations, the Technical Department dealt with many other problems. When the exiled camp authorities stopped the camp's electrical supply, the electricians among the prisoners siphoned electricity from the wires passing overhead just outside the perimeter fence. This too was terminated by the authorities after a few days, and thereafter the prisoners used a modified motor as a generator and even improvised a running tap \\"hydroelectric station\\" to supply power to the government headquarters and medical barracks.Solzhenitsyn, p. 308.  Negotiations  Negotiations between the authorities and rebels began almost immediately, as was becoming the custom with prisoner disturbances, but were fraught with difficulty from the beginning. The camp authorities again immediately acquiesced to virtually all of the prisoners demands, but this time, with the past deceit still fresh in their minds, the prisoners did not accept this solution as sufficient and demanded a written agreement. A draft was composed by the authorities and passed around the camp. Negotiations then recessed until higher-ranking officers arrived on the site. Solzhenitsyn explained: To these generals and others were presented the same set of demands: punishment of the soldiers responsible for the murder of various prisoners and beating of women prisoners; that prisoners who had been transferred to other camps as punishment for participating in a strike be brought back; that prisoners no longer had to wear degrading number patches or be locked into their dormitories at night; that the walls separating camp divisions (namely between the men's and women's camps) not be rebuilt; that an eight-hour work day be instituted; that limits be ended for the number of letters they could send and receive; that certain hated camp guards and officials be removed from Kengir; and that, most importantly, their cases be reviewed.Solzhenitsyn, p. 311. None of these demands were unconstitutional. All of the prisoner's demands were accounted for in the original regulation; the prisoners were asking for the enforcement of their rights. The generals, now with Sergei Yegorov, deputy chief of the MVD, and Ivan Dolgikh, division commander of Gulag, among them, once again agreed to the prisoners demands, but, still failing to match a written contract to their words, they were once again rejected by the prisoners. The discussions then degenerated into threats and counter-threats. The prisoners, due to a lack of trust in their current negotiating partners, demanded that a member of the Central Committee be sent and this was refused.  Sowing discord  Prior to the raid, attempts were made by the camp authorities to cause violence within the camp, both so that the prisoners would attack each other and make the job easier for the invading troops, and to provide an ostensible justification for the armed intervention that was to come. Direct requests were made to high-ranking prisoners that they \\"provoke racial bloodbath\\" in exchange for their livesSolzhenitsyn, p. 314. (any prisoner that publicly occupied a high post in the camp's provisional government was sure to be tried and executed when captured, as the prisoners themselves knew). Relying on the then existing paranoia and distrust of Jews in Russia, the authorities also attempted to spread rumors in the camp that a pogrom was imminent. While these efforts largely failed, another objective of the authorities ‚Äî to draw out orthodox Communists and Soviet loyalists ‚Äî was successful and a number of them fled the camp in the days before the raid,Solzhenitsyn, p. 315. including a high-ranking member of the prisoner's government who would later urge surrender by the guards' loudspeakers. Nevertheless, this outflow was quickly halted by Internal Security, who captured those speaking favorably of the authorities or of surrender and locked them in the camp's jail.  Suppression   Prelude  During the days prior to the raid, small incursions were made. First, this was done to test the preparedness and defensive capabilities of the prisoners ‚Äî alarms were sounded and prisoners quickly assumed battle positions ‚Äî but later it was done for the sake of photography. This footage later became important to the authorities in their effort to identify and punish all those who participated directly with the uprising, as well as secure their justification for the raid.Solzhenitsyn, pp. 320‚Äì321. At this time, the morale of the prisoners was also decreasing. Many came to have a sense of the futility of their own struggle, and this attitude proved infectious. The leader of the prisoners, Kuznetsov, even betrayed his wariness in a speech, retold by Solzhenitsyn: Making matters worse for the prisoners, the day before the raid it was announced by the guards' loudspeakers that their demand to meet with a member of the Central Committee was to be granted. This had the effect of decreasing the prisoners' guard and creating a less hostile opinion about the camp authorities. In addition, Solzhenitsyn recalls that the prisoners heard for days before the raid what they thought were the sounds of tractors running on the distance, out of sight. It turned out that the noise of the tractors was being used to conceal the sounds of tanks - which the prisoners did not anticipate would be used against them - as they were moved into position.  The raid  T-34 tanks were used to help end the rebellion, bringing in barbed wire-laden trestles and firing blank shells to stoke confusion and fear. At 3:30 AM on June 26, flares were shot up into the sky and the raid began. Snipers quickly shot the sentries on the rooftops before they could sound the alarm, and the tanks rolled through the perimeter fence. Five tanks, 90 dogs, and 1,700 troops in battle-gear stormed the camp complex. Panic and chaos followed. While some 'detachments' vigorously fought back despite heavy losses and throwing improvised sulfur bombs at the tanks, other prisoners hid or committed suicide. The tanks, T-34s, alternately ran over prisoners or brought down barrack walls where prisoners were hiding, and used blank rounds of ammunition to strike terror and confusion into the prisoners. The hundreds of Soviet soldiers used live ammunition, and many prisoners were killed. Some tanks carried in barbed wire-laden trestles, and these were immediately set down as a means of quickly dividing up the camp and hindering the prisoners' freedom of movement. The commanders of the rebellion were specifically targeted by designated squads of soldiers and they were taken into custody alive; many of them were later tried and executed. After ninety minutes of violence, the remaining live prisoners, most of whom were in hiding, were ordered to come out on the promise that they would not be shot.  Aftermath  According to a number of survivors of the camp, five to seven hundred prisoners were either killed or wounded in the rebellion, with an additional six of the highest-ranking prisoners later being executed, Knopmus among them. Notes found in the Soviet archives, though, claim that only 37 were killed, not including those who later died of their wounds or were executed, and with 106 prisoners and 40 soldiers wounded. Kuznetsov, however, had his death sentence commuted to 25 years and found himself released and fully rehabilitated after 5 years of imprisonment. Theories abound as to why, but most attribute this to the detailed 43-page confession he wrote in which he denounced scores of fellow prisoners. This confession also proved to be an invaluable source for many of the studies performed on the Kengir rebellion, although some question its veracity. In keeping with the prevailing theme of their story, the camp administration is said to have planted weapons on the corpses of those who didn't already have them for the sake of the photographers, who were brought in expressly for this purpose.Solzhenitsyn, p. 328. On the day after the raid, almost a thousand prisoners were shipped away to different camps and the remaining prisoners were occupied with the task of, once again, rebuilding the destroyed wall, sealing themselves back into imprisonment.  Significance  Among the strikes and rebellions that were occurring in Gulags across the USSR in this period, the rebellion at Kengir was perhaps the most significant. While Stalin's death, Lavrentiy Beria's arrest, and Nikita Khrushchev's rise bore much promise for the prisoners, who had long expected general amnesties and rehabilitation to follow these events, the role of the Kengir rebellion in hastening this process cannot be overlooked. The rebellion further demonstrated to the authorities that Stalinism was not a sustainable policy option and that mass injustices such as those occurring in the Gulag would have a significant cost. In a shift that boded poorly for the Soviet regime, many of the prisoners took part knowing full well that they were doing so at the cost of their lives, and prisoners in other camps, namely in the nearby Rudnik camp, had joined with the Kengir prisoners in solidarity, beginning their own short-lived strikes. The significance of the temporary freedom enjoyed by those prisoners was not lost on many. In a 1978 review of Solzhenitsyn's book, Hilton Kramer of The New York Times declared that the rebellion \\"restored a measure of humane civilization to the prisoners before the state was able to assert its implacable power again.\\" At a 2004 reunion of Kengir prisoners, a survivor of the camp mentioned that, despite the brutality and loss of life that came with the rebellion's suppression, the 40 days engendered in the prisoners \\"a great feeling of freeing one's spirit\\", and another prisoner recalled that \\"I had not before then, and have not since, felt such a sense of freedom as I did then\\" ‚Äî both sentiments stated by Solzhenitsyn. Indeed, Solzhenitsyn later dedicated a screenplay he had written to the bravery of the Kengir rebels, entitled Tanks Know the Truth ().Between July 1988 and December 1989 there was a rumor that then √©migr√© movie director Andrzej Wajda would make a movie based on this screenplay, and Wajda wanted in fact to make this movie, however, he wanted to be able to return to then Communist-ruled Poland, and was afraid that making such a movie would block him from doing so. He hesitated and eventually decided not to make the movie after all. In a 2001 interview with Moscow News, Wajda expressed his regret that he did not make the movie.Russ Lib. Most remarkably, as George Mason University historian Steven A. Barnes noted in a 2005 edition of Slavic Review, the prisoners' campaign was performed with a certain pragmatism, and their propaganda with a degree of skill, that was all but unprecedented. As noted, instead of making explicit their hostility to the Soviet regime and given an excuse to the authorities to invade, they ostensibly expressed approval of the state while, meekly, asking for the restoration of the rights and privileges afforded to them in the Soviet constitution. This message was itself spread not only to the camp authorities and any of the MVD officials that would visit the camp for negotiations, but, crucially, to the civilian population surrounding the camp. Before the authorities came up with the idea of using their own rival kites to tangle and bring down the prisoner's kites with, they kept a large retinue of guards and warders, on horseback and motorcycle, waiting for the leaflets to be dropped from the kites so that they could, literally, chase down and retrieve them before they could be read by members of the public. The tact, cohesion, and ingenuity displayed in the rebellion was troubling to the authorities. Nevertheless, any potential effect the rebellion could have had was limited by the nature of the Soviet regime, which was quick to use massive force to quell even the most humble of threats. In the same Times review, Kramer issued an important caveat to his previous claim:  See also  * List of uprisings in the Gulag * Bitch Wars * Russian mafia * Novocherkassk massacre * List of Gulag camps  Notes   References    Gulag uprisings Massacres in the Soviet Union Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic Organized crime conflicts Conflicts in 1954 1954 riots 1954 protests 1954 in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic 1954 in the Soviet Union Mass murder in 1954 ","title":"Kengir uprising"},{"id":"6479367","text":"Loranz√® is a comune (municipality) in the Metropolitan City of Turin in the Italian region Piedmont, located about north of Turin.

The most important manuscript of the Chronica (Paris Bibl. Nat. Latin 5212) dates from the early 14th century. It was probably written in or near Toulouse and perhaps belonged to a Dominican foundation such as Prouille. Two further manuscripts are later copies of this one. A fourth (Paris Bibl. Nat. Latin 5213) is of the 16th century but based on an early manuscript now lost. The 1623 edition by Guillaume Catel (see below) was based on other manuscripts now lost. The oldest manuscript provides two possible longer titles for the work. The incipit is Incipit chronica a magistro Guillelmo de Podio Laurenti compilata, \\"here begins the chronicle compiled by Master William of Puylaurens\\". The prologue is headed Incipit prologus super hystoria negocii a Francis Albiensis vulgariter appellati, \\"here begins the prologue of the history of what the French call the Albigensian affair\\". The chronicle opens with the preaching of Bernard of Clairvaux against the heretics of Verfeil, Haute-Garonne in 1145 and closes with the restitution, on 15 March 1275, of the confiscated lands of Roger-Bernard III of Foix. Work on the chronicle was completed before 25 July 1276, date of the death of James I of Aragon, who is spoken of in the final sentence as still alive. In the 14th century the Chronica was used by the Dominican historian Bernard Gui, who included long excerpts from it in his Flores chronicorum. An anonymous abbreviation of this latter work was made in the late 15th century under the title Praeclara Francorum facinora; as a popular history this appeared in several undated editions during the first few decades after the spread of printing.

Decades later, Burks and his wife Alice Burks outlined their case for the subject matter of the ENIAC having been derived from John Vincent Atanasoff. Burks was also for several decades a faculty member at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Early life and education Burks was born in Duluth, Minnesota. He earned his B.A. in mathematics and physics from DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana in 1936 and his M.A. and Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor in 1937 and 1941, respectively. The Moore School The summer after obtaining his Ph.D., the young Dr. Burks moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and enrolled in the national defense electronics course offered by the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Electrical Engineering; his laboratory teaching assistant was J. Presper Eckert, a graduate student at the Moore School; a fellow student was John Mauchly, the chairman of the physics department at Ursinus College in nearby Collegeville, Pennsylvania. Both Burks and Mauchly sought and obtained teaching positions at the Moore School the following fall, and roomed together throughout the academic year. The ENIAC When Mauchly and Eckert's proposed concept for an electronic digital computer was funded by the U.S. Army's Ballistics Research Laboratory in June 1943, Burks was added to the design team. Among his principal contributions to the project was the design of the high-speed multiplier unit. (Also during this time, Burks met and married Alice Rowe, a human computer employed at the Moore School.) In April 1945, with John Grist Brainerd, Burks was charged with writing the technical reports on the ENIAC for publication. Also during 1945 Burks assisted with the preliminary logical design of the EDVAC in meetings attended by Mauchly, Eckert, John von Neumann, and others. Burks also took a part-time position as a philosophy instructor at Swarthmore College during 1945‚Äì1946. The IAS On March 8, 1946 Burks accepted an offer by von Neumann to join the computer project at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and joined full-time the following summer. (Already on the project was another member of the ENIAC team, Herman Goldstine. Together, Goldstine and Burks gave nine of the Moore School Lectures in Summer 1946.) During his time at the IAS, Burks worked to expand von Neumann's theory of automata. The University of Michigan After working on this project, Burks relocated to Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1946 to join the faculty of the University of Michigan, first as an assistant professor of philosophy, and as a full professor by 1954. With Irving Copi he sketched the necessary design for general purpose computing.A.W. Burks & Irving Copi (1956) \\"The Logical Design of an Idealized General-Purpose Computer\\", Journal of the Franklin Institute 261: 299‚Äì314, and 421‚Äì36 Burks helped found the university's computer science department, first as the Logic of Computers group in 1956, of which he was the director, then as a graduate program in 1957, and then as an undergraduate program within the new Department of Computer and Communication in 1967, which he chaired until 1971. He declined a position heading up a different university's computing center, citing his primary interest as the purely theoretical aspects of computing machines. He was awarded the Louis E. Levi Medal in 1956. Burks' doctoral students include John Holland, who in 1959 was the first student to receive a Ph.D. in computer science from Michigan, and possibly the first in the world.. Burks served as president of the Charles S. Peirce Society in 1954‚Äì1955.See \\"Presidents of the Charles S. Peirce Society\\" at the Charles S. Peirce Society Website. Eprint . He edited the final two volumes (VII-VIII), published 1958, of the Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce and, over the years, wrote published articles on Peirce. Restoration of parts of the ENIAC In the 1960s he was presented with the opportunity to acquire four units of the original ENIAC, which had been rusting in a storage Quonset hut in Aberdeen, Maryland. He ran the units through a car wash before restoring them and donating them to the University of Michigan. They are currently on display in the entryway of the Computer Science Building. Patent dispute In 1964 Burks was approached by attorney Sy Yuter and asked to join T. Kite Sharpless and Robert F. Shaw in litigation that would add their names as inventors to the ENIAC patent, which would allow them to profit from the sale of licenses to the premiere electronic digital computer apart from Sperry Rand, the company that owned the Eckert-Mauchly interest in the patent and was at that time seeking royalties from other computer manufacturers. This endeavor was never successful; in the 1973 decision to Honeywell v. Sperry Rand, U.S. District Judge Earl R. Larson ruled‚Äîeven as he invalidated the patent‚Äîthat only Mauchly and Eckert had invented the ENIAC, and that Burks, Sharpless, and Shaw could not be added as inventors. The BACH Group In the 1970s Burks began meeting with Bob Axelrod, Michael Cohen, and John Holland, researchers with interests in interdisciplinary approaches to studying complex adaptive systems. Known as the BACH group (an acronym of their surnames), it came to include, among others, Pulitzer Prize winner Douglas Hofstadter, evolutionary biologist William Hamilton, microbiologist Michael Savageau, mathematician Carl Simon and computer scientists Reiko Tanese, Melanie Mitchell and Rick Riolo. The BACH group continues to meet irregularly as part of the University of Michigan's Center for the Study of Complex Systems (CSCS). In the 1970s and 1980s Burks, working with his wife Alice, authored a number of articles on the ENIAC, and a book on the Atanasoff‚ÄìBerry Computer. As professor emeritus In 1990, Burks donated a portion of his papers to the university's Bentley Historical Library, where they are accessible to researchers. Burks died May 14, 2008 in an Ann Arbor, Michigan nursing home from Alzheimer's disease.

The submarine was laid down on 17 February 1942 at the Deutsche Werft yard at Hamburg as yard number 351, launched on 11 September 1942 and commissioned on 25 November 1942 under the command of Kapit√§nleutnant Helmut Hennig. After training with the 4th U-boat Flotilla in the Baltic Sea, U-533 was transferred to the 10th flotilla for front-line service on 1 May 1943. Design German Type IXC/40 submarines were slightly larger than the original Type IXCs. U-533 had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. The U-boat had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two MAN M 9 V 40/46 supercharged four-stroke, nine-cylinder diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Siemens- Schuckert 2 GU 345/34 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to . The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . U-533 was fitted with six torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and two at the stern), 22 torpedoes, one SK C/32 naval gun, 180 rounds, and a SK C/30 as well as a C/30 anti- aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of forty-eight. Service history 1st patrol U-533 departed Kiel on 15 April 1943, and sailed out into the Atlantic, but came under repeated attack from Allied aircraft, giving it very little opportunity to cause any damage to shipping. On 24 April U-533 was attacked by a Hudson light bomber of No. 269 Squadron RAF. The U-boat was moderately damaged by the attack, defending itself with its AA guns. The next day, 25 April, the submarine was attacked again from the air, this time by an American PBY-5A Catalina of United States Navy squadron VP-84. Three of the U-boat's gunners were injured, but the U-boat was not severely damaged. On 20 May U-533 was attacked by a Halifax heavy bomber of No. 502 Squadron RAF, without suffering any serious damage. The U-boat arrived at her new home port of Lorient in occupied France, on 24 May after 40 days at sea. 2nd patrol On 5 July 1943 the U-boat sailed from Lorient, through the Atlantic, around the Cape of Good Hope, into the Indian Ocean, and up to the mouth of the Persian Gulf. Operating as part of the Monsun Gruppe, it was sunk in the Gulf of Oman on 16 October, in position , by depth charges dropped from a British Bisley (Blenheim) light bomber of No. 244 Squadron RAF, piloted by Lewis William Chapman. Of the crew of 53, only one survived; Matrosengefreiter G√ºnther Schmidt, who was with an officer in the conning tower. The officer succeeded in opening the hatch, even though the submarine had sunk to a depth of . Without escape sets, the water pressure shot both men to the surface. Schmidt kept the unconscious officer afloat for an hour before he died, and Schmidt swam and stayed afloat without a life jacket for 28 hours until he was rescued by near Khor Fakkan. Schmidt spent the remainder of the war as a POW. Chapman received the Distinguished Flying Medal for his action. Wreck In 2009, divers found the wreck of U-533 at a depth of some off the coast of Fujairah. The U-boat slid nose-first into the sandy bottom, leaving her bow partially submerged and stern and propeller exposed.

It is also the southeastern terminus of Line 2's Sinjeong Branch to Kkachisan (underground platform 3). The station is located at the northern edge of Sindorim-dong, Guro-gu, Seoul, on the border with Yeongdeungpo-gu. Sindorim station is designed primarily to serve as a transfer station of the Subway Lines 1 and 2, having no direct exits from the Line 1 platform. It is known to be the most congested transfer station of Seoul Subway, especially during the rush hours. It is estimated that over 320,000 passengers per day use Sindorim Station to transfer between Lines 1 and 2. A plan to extend the Line 2 part of the station, including a new platform for the outer circle line, is now on design. Screen doors have been added to the subway platforms. D-Cube City, a large leisure complex consisting of a Hyundai department store, additional coffee shops & restaurants on the periphery, a Sheraton Hotel and a Lotte Cinema, is located next to the station. The complex was opened in 2011 and is directly connected to the station by an underground passageway which passes under the entire width of the station. All Line 2 trains that operate up to this station take the Sinjeong branch to be serviced at the Sinjeong train servicing depot, located next to Yangcheon-gu Office station. In 2013, improvements were made in terms of accessibility for Line 1. A new overhead concourse was constructed above the Line platforms to ease congestion in the underground concourse, where passengers transfer between Lines 1 and 2.

It is now owned by Newsquest and their newspapers are printed in Glasgow. The company was formerly known as the Cumbrian Newspapers Group Ltd but changed its name to reflect the fact that is no longer primarily a newspaper publisher. One of its principal subsidiaries, however, is still known as Cumbrian Newspapers Ltd. History The company can trace its origins to the founding of the Carlisle Patriot newspaper in 1815, which eventually became the Cumberland News. Historical copies of the Carlisle Patriot, dating back to 1817, are available to search and view in digitised form at The British Newspaper Archive.Digitised copies of the Carlisle Patriot Radio Until 2017 CN Group owned two radio stations: Lancaster-based The Bay and Kendal-based Lakeland Radio. In October 2017 it was announced that both had been sold to the UK media company Global. The company formerly owned the Touch Radio Network stations in the Midlands outright until selling them to Quidem in June 2009. The two exceptions to this were the Loughborough licence, Oak FM, which was sold to the Lincs FM Group, and the Banbury Touch FM licence, which was sold to a private consortium and relaunched as Banbury Sound. It quickly became apparent that operating these licences outside of the regional network was not a commercially sensible move. As a result, Quidem acquired Banbury Sound in 2010 and Oak FM in 2012, effectively reforming the original CN Midlands network. In September 2019, it was announced that Quidem, the station's current owners, were running at a financial loss and the business had entered into a brand-licensing agreement with Global Radio. This change means that the Quidem group of stations will take one of Global's brands.Radio Today - Quidem enters brand licensing agreement with Global, 02 September 2019 At the beginning of October, Ofcom opened a consultation following Quidem's request for its six stations to make significant changes to their formats.OfCom - Banbury Sound, Rugby FM and Touch FM Requests to change Format, 02 October 2019 CN previously owned Mid FM in Northern Ireland.

It is centered on an orphan named Oliver, who inherits Helton Hall, and whose cousins Frieda and Fulton Snodde-Brittle want to kill him because he is the rightful owner of Helton Hall. Plot The Wilkinson family become ghosts after they die in a tragic bombing in World War II, apart from Trixie - Mrs. Wilkinson's sister. Initially, they haunt their home, Resthaven, and they adopt another young ghost, a girl they name Adopta, who has no memory of her past. When the arrival of new owners forces them to leave, they travel to London and reluctantly begin haunting an underwear store, and apply to the Dial-a-Ghost agency for a new home. The Dial-a-Ghost agency finds the perfect home for the Wilkinsons in a ruined abbey, and tells them they can move in on Friday 13th. Meanwhile, orphan Oliver Smith is surprised to learn he is a descendant of the Snodde-Brittle family, and that he now owns Helton Hall, after the death of his cousin. He is taken from the orphanage to Helton Hall by his cousins Fulton and Frieda, who feel they should rightly have inherited the Hall. Learning that Oliver is asthmatic, Fulton hires some terrifying, child-hating ghosts known as the Shriekers, hoping to frighten Oliver to death. On the day of the move, the two sets of ghosts receive each other's directions by accident. The Wilkinsons arrive at Helton Hall, and, although they initially scare Oliver, they soon become close friends. The Shriekers, however, are exorcised from the ruined abbey after attacking livestock belonging to the nunnery. When the Dial-a-Ghost agency realizes their mistake, they send the Shriekers to Helton Hall and ring the Wilkinsons to apologize. Oliver, however, refuses to let the Wilkinsons leave and also invites their friends from London to move in. When the Shriekers arrive, they attack Oliver, but are distracted by Adopta - the daughter whose loss drove them to madness. They agree to behave better in future, but are confused as to why they were sent to attack Oliver when he is supposed to have ordered child-hating ghosts. The Wilkinsons realize Fulton is to blame and send Oliver to London to keep him safe. Fulton and Frieda are now in severe debt and, believing Oliver to have been killed by the Shriekers, they spend thirty thousand pounds on 'Ectoplasm Eating Bacteria' to clear out the ghosts. Oliver returns home to the unmoving remains of the ghosts, and is distraught. He attacks Fulton and Frieda, but is distracted by the ghost budgie for long enough to let them escape. As the ghosts wake up, they realise the Ectoplasm Eating Bacteria was a con, and Oliver happily opens up the Hall to any ghosts needing a home, running it as a tourist attraction and a paranormal research institute. He even rebuilds the Wilkinson's home, Resthaven, recreating it exactly as it was before the bombing. Frieda, meanwhile, repents her sins and becomes a nun, but Fulton goes after the con artists. He is killed and asks for a home from the Dial-a-Ghost agency, who send him to the underwear store.

Description Vipera aspis zinnikeri is relatively small in size, with a maximum total length (body + tail) of . Also, the head is long and narrow compared to other subspecies of this species. The total number of ventrals plus subcaudals is 175-187 in males and 170-183 in females. The color pattern is much like that of Vipera berus. The dorsal pattern is fused into a broad, wavy or zigzag dark stripe that contains a straight-edged, pale stripe about three scales wide. This pattern stands out clearly against the ground color, which is particularly light along the edges of the dorsal pattern. Series of dark vertical bars or extended ovals run along the flanks, opposing the indentations of the dorsal pattern. The aforementioned middorsal stripe may be pale beige or grey. The ground color of some specimens may approach clear orange. Geographic range This race is found in the Pyrenees region of northeastern Spain and southwestern France.

These cigars were commonly rolled for national banquets and other public affairs and became colloquially known as Vegueros, after the farmers and field hands that work on Cuba's tobacco and sugar cane plantations. The first people outside of Cuba to become acquainted with these cigars were tourists on sight-seeing trips through Cuba's cigar tobacco-growing regions.

It contains fifteen species that grow as shrubs or trees. This is unusual, because tree species are uncommon in Asteraceae. The genus Scalesia resulted from a blunder by Arnott who named it in honour of \\"W. Scales Esq., Cawdor Castle, Elginshire\\" but discovered after publication that the name should have read 'Stables', after Scottish botanist, William Alexander Stables (1810‚Äì1890). All of the species have soft, pithy wood. Scalesia species have been called \\"the Darwin's finches of the plant world\\" because they show a similarly dramatic pattern of adaptive radiation. One of the largest and most widespread species is Scalesia pedunculata ‚Äì a large tree which grows up to 15 to 20 metres tall, reaching maturity in a few years time. These trees typically grow in dense stands of the same species and age. They die around the same time, and then a new generation of seedlings grows up in the same place. The largest stands of Scalesia pedunculata are found on the humid windward sides of Santa Cruz, San Crist√≥bal, Santiago and Floreana islands, at an altitude of 400‚Äì700 m. The best known and most visited stand is on Santa Cruz Island, and is crossed by a road. Scalesia atractyloides and S. stewartii are two small tree species, very similar to each other.

He remained on active duty after the war. In recognition of his service during the Civil War, he was appointed to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers. Blunt was notable as commander of the 2nd Vermont Brigade and the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Early life Blunt was born in Danville, Vermont. In 1850, Asa and his wife Mary were living in Southampton, New York, where he was an overseer in a cotton mill. By 1860, they were living in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, where Blunt was a draftsman for the Fairbanks Scales company. Civil War Blunt was appointed adjutant of the 3rd Vermont Infantry on June 6, 1861, and was mustered into federal service on July 16. On September 25, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel, 6th Vermont Infantry, and then Colonel of the 12th Vermont Infantry on September 19, 1862. On October 27, the 2nd Vermont Brigade was formed from the 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, and 16th, Vermont Infantry regiments, and Blunt assumed temporary command of the brigade as the ranking colonel, filling this position until December 7, when Brigadier General Edwin H. Stoughton arrived and assumed command. Stoughton was not popular with the officers and men of the brigade, so when he was captured by Confederate partisan John S. Mosby on March 9, 1863, few mourned his loss. Colonel Blunt assumed command of the brigade again, turning it over to the new brigade commander, Brigadier General George J. Stannard, on April 20. By the end of June, most of the brigade was waiting to muster out, their nine months obligation ended. But Robert E. Lee's incursion into Pennsylvania delayed that for a few weeks, and the brigade finally got to see some action. Blunt's 12th and the 15th regiments, however, were left behind in Emmitsburg, Maryland, guarding the supply trains, and were not able to participate in the brigade's flanking movement that helped stop Pickett's Charge on July 3 at the Battle of Gettysburg. On July 4, Blunt's regiment was released to return to Vermont, and he mustered out with the regiment on July 14, 1863. Just more than six months later, On February 24, 1864, Blunt was appointed Captain and Assistant Quartermaster of Volunteers, and was ordered to report to the Commanding General, Department of Virginia and North Carolina, for duty in the Quartermaster's Department, which duties he assumed on April 25. He became the Depot Quartermaster for the Army of the James on May 4, 1864, and served in this position until late 1865. In recognition of his meritorious service at the Battle at Lee's Mills and Savage's Station, President Andrew Johnson, on May 4, 1866, nominated Blunt for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on May 18, 1866.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 741. He also received appointments to the brevet grades of major, lieutenant colonel and colonel of volunteers, Quartermaster's Department, to rank from June 9, 1865.Eicher 2001, p. 135. He received appointments to the same brevet grades in the Regular Army to rank from March 2, 1867. Postwar life On July 14, he was transferred to Fort Monroe, remaining there until July 1866. In late August, he was transferred to the position of Chief of Quartermaster Department of the Potomac. He received a regular army commission as Captain and Assistant Quartermaster on March 28, 1867, and the same day, brevets to major and lieutenant colonel. On April 5, 1867, he was ordered to duty in connection with the National Cemeteries in the valleys of the James and Appomattox rivers and south of Richmond. On April 9, 1867, he was mustered out of the volunteers. On April 11 appointed Chief Quartermaster, First Military District, with headquarters in Richmond. He was later ordered to Washington, D.C., and placed in charge of Lincoln Depot and the various National Cemeteries in the Department of Washington. By March 1, 1869, he was Department Quartermaster in Charleston, South Carolina. Between 1877 and 1888 Blunt was Commandant of the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Blunt was promoted to permanent major on September 29, 1889. He died in Manchester, New Hampshire on October 4, 1889, and was buried at Pine Grove Cemetery in Manchester.

Virgin with child mosaic, Hagia Sophia Interior of Hosios Loukas  Concept  Because of problems with the term, scholars have employed alternative names to describe this period, including \\"renaissance\\" (with a small \\"r\\"), \\"renascence\\", Middle Byzantine Renaissance or First Byzantine Renaissance (the Palaeologan Renaissance from the 13th century on being the second). Macedonian art refers to the art of this period. Because the word Renaissance (rinascita) was created in the 15th and 16th centuries by Italian humanists to describe their own time, its use outside of that context is problematic; however, the period in question certainly did produce ideas and works of art that reflected a reassessment of classical ideals.For a discussion on the topic, see Cormack, Byzantine Art, pp. 130-142. The term Macedonian Renaissance was first used by Kurt Weitzmann in his The Joshua Roll: A Work of the Macedonian Renaissance.Weitzmann, Kurt. The Joshua Roll: A Work of the Macedonian Renaissance. Studies in Manuscript Illumination III, Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1948. It describes the architecture of Macedonia. At the same time, the manuscripts of \\"Paris Psalter\\" (cod. gr. 139, Paris, Bib. Nat. de France) were indicated as the best examples of Macedonian Renaissance by scholars.  Era  The term ‚ÄúByzantine‚Äù arose from Byzantium, a city founded in the eighth century BC on the site that would become Constantinople and is now Istanbul. Being on the easternmost territory of the Roman Empire allowed the groundwork for the Macedonian Renaissance to come about. Latin was the initial official language, while from the 7th century onwards Medieval Greek was the only language of administration, government and art in the Byzantine Empire and the religion was Orthodox Christianity.. The Oxford Handbook of Byzantine Studies edited by Elizabeth Jeffreys with John Haldon and Robin Cormack. Published 2008 by Oxford University Press. While the West Roman Empire had collapsed at the outset of the Middle Ages, its Eastern half, the Eastern Roman Empire, was able to survive and flourish. This was due mainly to its strategic location for commerce but also to the way it was able to hold back its enemies. Basil I (867-886), the founder of the Macedonian Dynasty of Byzantine rulers, was born in Thrace to a peasant family said to be of Armenian descent. He was employed in the influential circles of Constantinople and was rapidly promoted by the emperor Michael III eventually becoming co-emperor.\\"Basil I\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 13 May. 2012 . By means of political maneuvering he was able to secure his future as emperor and then began military and diplomatic campaigns to secure the empire. He was able to regain control over Crete and Cyprus at the same time he was able to hold back First Bulgarian Empire's advances into his territory. His dynasty was thus able to maintain a period of peace under which economics, philosophy, art, and greek culture could thrive. This period produced a shift from the ban on the painting of religious figures to icons being painted to reflect the more classical and naturalistic influences of art on the culture. Mosaics such as the Virgin and Child in Hagia Sophia can still be seen today. The new style of art may have inspired Italian artists such as Cimabue and GiottoByzantine art before the Italian Renaissance. The period also saw a proliferation of literature, such as De Ceremoniis (\\"The Book of Ceremonies\\"), which focused on governance, diplomatic interactions with neighboring nations, and other customs of the time. Education had also become a priority once again and the University of Constantinople boasted scholars such as Michael Psellus, who wrote the Chronographia, a history of fourteen Byzantine rulers. Meanwhile, reforms in law sought to limit the power and growth of large land owners by the formation of trade guilds that allowed the state to control growth as described in the Book of the Eparch. The building Magnaura in Constantinople had already become a school in 849 and was headed by the philosopher Leo the Mathematician (c. 790 ‚Äì after 869).macedonian-heritage.gr: Leon the Mathematician Most of his works are lost.

One theory of the name's origin is that it derives from Ulkos, the name of a leader of the Celtic Salassi tribe.Note di toponomastica: Periodo Pre-Romano. Accessed 25 September 2008. Another theory holds that the derivation is from Ultor, a title of the god Mars, to whom a temple in the area was dedicated. These names were first rendered as Ulces, and later Ulcium on maps in the Middle Ages, in Latin. From the older forms, the name became Olcs in the Occitan language and was later Francized as Oulx. As part of Italian Fascist Italianization, Oulx was renamed Ulzio from 1928 to 1947.

History The ancestors of the people of Kau Tam Tso Village first came to settle in the New Territories of Hong Kong during the middle of the Qing dynasty. They were nomadic farmers, planting rice and crops, and moved from one part of the New Territories to another before finally settling down in its current location towards the end of the Qing dynasty. Prior to migrating southward to the New Territories, they previously settled in the Bao'an County at the beginning of the Qing dynasty. The family tree of the Lee Clan in the Kau Tam Tso Village is documented in the Village Name List Book (). This Village Name List Book also holds family tree records that date back to the Tang dynasty in which the first \\"Lee\\" ancestor was believed to have come from central China, an area around the current Hubei and Hunan border. During the two great wars, Kau Tam Tso Villagers joined the Resistance Army with neighbouring villagers and fought against the Japanese occupation. It is believed that, in the vicinity of the current village location, long network of tunnels were dug into the hills as hiding places during the wars. These were later destroyed by the monsoon rains after the second world war. With recognition and sponsorship from the current Government of Hong Kong, a monument has been erected near the entrance to the Wu Kau Tang Village that commemorates those who lost their lives in order for present generations to live in peace.ÊäóÊà∞ËÄÅÂÖµËΩüÊó•ÁÑ°‰∏≠ÁîüÊúâ To date, many households still possess Japanese paper currencies that were used during the wars, with the hope that at some point in the future, the current or future Japanese Government will exchange and compensate with today's currencies.

There were around 500-600 residents in the most prosperous period. Around a hundred years ago, Lai Chi Wo village was once a poor village.Hong Kong Herbarium: Feng Shui Stroy of Lai Chi Wo At that time, a feng shui master suggested building 3 feng shui walls for the village to get rid of the evil spirits and keep the property safe inside the village. After the setting-up of the three walls, the village regained its prosperity as before. In the recent years, most of the younger residents have moved out for a better living in town areas like Fanling and Tai Po, or emigrated to overseas, leaving the village with the older residents only. The original residents will, however, go back to the village whenever there are celebrations, like the Tai Ping Ching Chiu festival once every 10 years. Lai Chi Wo is now the 16th special region inside Hong Kong.News.gov.hk This special region is legalised in 2004 and enacted in 2005. Moreover, it has become one of the frequent hiking sites in Hong Kong. Local tours have developed their route to Lai Chi Wo, and the hikers will start their route from Wu Kau Tang near Tai Po or Luk Keng near Fanling. Hikers generally take Lai Chi Wo as a mid-way station. Name As the name suggests, this area was once known for its lychee trees and it got its name before the Hakka settlement. In the 1960s and 1970s villagers found it more profitable to plant mandarins, which could fetch good prices towards Chinese New Year (as they are seen as auspicious). However, even the local villagers still can not confirm if the village got the name because of the lychee trees or another reason. Location Lai Chi Wo is situated inside the Plover Cove Country Park and Yan Chau Tong Marine Park. The area is situated in the North- eastern part of New Territories, near Sha Tau Kok. The altitude of Lai Chi Wo is about 10 metres. It is around 1 hectare of special region inside the area of Lai Chi Wo. Structure of the village The buildings Lai Chi Wo walled-village and the houses inside adapt the structure of typical Hakka village. There are a total of 211 houses inside the village, including 3 ancestral halls (the Tsang's ancestral Hall, the Wong's ancestral Hall and the Wong's Weixing ancestral Hall). 131 of the houses are single storied buildings. Another 76 are double-storey buildings, and the remaining four are three-storey building. The village is structured in 3 rows and 9 columns. The residents Inhabitants of this village were from the Tsang and Wong Hakka families. Only one family still lives there and the rest have either moved overseas or to other parts of Hong Kong. The Hakka residents originate from Kaifeng, Henan at around 2500 years ago. Moreover, the Wongs in Lai Chi Wo are from Fujian, via Huizhou to Hong Kong during early Qing dynasty.

Good fung shui of the village ought to be embraced by mountains and hills at the back and on both sides. This can be served as a \\"green barrier\\" for the village. Native trees and shrubs are crucial concern for the selection of the fung shui sites, and villagers would also plant vegetations of different values to be added in the forest. Following the development of the forest, a C-shaped like forest would encompass the village, forming a typical layout of fung shui setting of the village and fung shui forest. ;Functions Fung shui forest can protect and alleviate the impact of strong breeze and sun burn. During the time of heavy rainstorm, mudflow or landslide may happen. The natural barrier can help reduce the level of destructiveness by its retention capacity to stop the water and mudflow. Also, the dense broad-leaved trees are good resisters devoted to prevent hillfire from spreading. In economical terms, villagers grow the economic crops at the edge of the forest. It includes edible stuff and vegetation for medical purpose. They can be used as fuel wood or construction materials. ;Natural conservation Fung shui woods have the ability to stabilise the slopes as well as to avoid leakage of surface nutrients and organic substances after heavy downpour. Moreover, the physical landscape and natural habitat of Hong Kong can be preserved. Indeed, they act as a breeding ground for other fauna such as birds, bats, butterflies and mammals to thrive. ;The Lai Chi Wo Fung Shui Wood The fung shui forest still exists thanks to the effort of the villagers in the past to use every means to preserve it, such as limiting the number of days for fuel wood collection and imposing penalties for the damage of trees. The 5‚Äì7 hectare fung shui forest comprises thick trees and shrubs. Most of them are 10‚Äì20 metres tall. We can see the great bio-diversity in Lai Chi Wo fung shui forest. For instance, we can find wild animals such as the Masked Palm Civet (Paguma larvata) and Chinese Porcupine (Hystrix brachyuran). Moreover, more than 100 plants have been recorded. Ordinary fung shui wood species like the Endospermum (Endospermum Chinese), Schima (Schima superb), Lance-leaved Sterculia (Sterculia lanceolata), Incense Tree (Ardisia quinquegona) can be seen. Other less common species like the Sampson Macaranga (Macaranga sampsonii), Lankok Fig (Ficus lankokensis) and Golden-leaved Tree (Chrysophyllum lanceolatum) have also been found. It is really of great preservation value. Siu Ying Primary School Siu Ying Primary School Siu Ying Primary School has a long history.Eco Association As there was no school in the other six villages, children of those seven villages went to this school to study. It closed in 1980. Then it had been left for many years. It will be converted to tourist centre in the forthcoming years. The objective of the centre is to let people know the importance of eco-awareness and preservation of environment, species, ecology, culture, learn about the natural environment, plants and animal species of Lai Chi Wo, experience the village culture in the New Territories. Stone mills and well Stone mills are used to peel the crust of the wheat. Each one is made up of two big cylindrical stone structure stacked together. The surface of the rocks is very rough. After you pour the wheat into the mills, you stir the rock structure, and the wheat will be peeled off into rice that villagers can eat. By virtue of the fact that there was no tap-water, villagers have to fulfill their needs by getting waters from rivers and wells. However, there were not enough rivers near Lai Chi Wo, villagers started to dig wells and use underground water to meet the daily demands. But nowadays wells are abandoned. Hing Chun Engagement (Seven-Village Square) There are 7 villages involved in the Hing Chun Engagement (, Hing Chun Yeuk). They are Lai Chi Wo, So Lo Pun, Sam A Village, Mui Tsz Lam (), Kop Tong (), Siu Tan () and Ngau Chi Wu ()Brief Information on proposed Grade III Items: Hip Tin Temple & Hok Shan Monastery, see pp. 710‚Äì711 which are located at the coast of Northeast New Territories and facing Kat O. In ancient time, when the ancestors of the 7 villages first settled in this place, the mountain and land were barren and arable lands were insufficient. They opened up wastelands and built up houses sparing no effort. Gradually, the families began to enlarge and became villages until Eastern Sha Tau Kok was developed, the 7 villages associated and made up the Hing Chung Engagement. They also opened up the Seven-Village Square. After the establishment of the engagement, the life has been smooth therefore villages all believed that it was because of the blessing of Guan Di and Guan Yin. To thank the gods and pray for good fortune, they decided to hold a ten-year session (Bun Festival). Ancestral Hall Ancestral Hall is the representative building of a clan with a lot of spirit tablet worshiping ancestors according to their positions in the family hierarchy. The eldest is located on the highest place and the younger ones are located on the lower places. Every Tomb-sweeping Day and Double Ninth Festival, or some other big festivals, villagers must worship the temple. There are two main families in Lai Chi Wo: Wong family and Tsang family. Therefore, there are temples of this two families in Lai Chi Wo. Hip Tin Temple and Hok Shan Monastery Hip Tin Temple and Hok Shan Monastery There are Hip Tin Temple and Hok Shan Monastery in the Square of Lai Chi Wo Village. It was built in the Qing dynasty. There is a history of more than two hundred years. The two structures are connected. They are categorised as Grade II historic buildings. They were jointly built by the seven villages in Sha Tau Kok, Hing Chun Yuek for drawing good fortune and expelling the evils. The village people worship Guan Di and Guan Yin. Hip Tin Temple is for Guan Di in which there is a statue of Guan Di while Hok Shan Monastery is for Guan Yin. East Gate and West Gate The East Gate and the West Gate are the entrances of the village. The East Gate is the main entrance on which there was engraved a sentence 'The purple cloud comes from the East.' In Chinese, purple means good fortune. The objective of the sentence is to hope to have highly placed or high-ranking government officials and noble lords coming into the village all the time so that it makes the village prosperous and flourishing. On the other hand, there was engraved a sentence 'The west can receive the auspicious light of luck.' on the West Gate. It means the village people hope to get luck and peace. Environment and special species Five-finger Camphor The Hollow Tree. Lai Chi Wo Nature TrailHong Kong Wetland Park The broad way inside the Nature Trail was constructed in 2003 as a viewing platform. It is 120 metres long and introduces three main features in the eastern mudflat corner of Lai Chi Wo. The trail is 1.2 km. =Looking-glass mangrove and White-flower Derris= The mangrove in Lai Chi Wo consists of Looking-glass mangrove (Heritiera littoralis) and White-flower Derris. Looking-glass mangrove is a species of mangrove whose biggest forest is to be found in Lai Chi Wo. Every April and May are their blossom seasons and fruits can be harvested from June to October. The fruit is round and green at first, and then become brown when it ripens. In the middle of the fruit, you may find a carinate tuber which makes it look like the Japanese Ultraman. Hence, it is commonly called \\"Ultraman Fruit\\". Heritiera littoralis is grand, peculiar and has a thick tree-crown. It is almost tall enough to reach the chest of people. The interlaced plank buttress serves to grasp the swampy soil in the tide zone to hold the body of the tree. And the \\"natural swing\\" around the forest of Looking-glass mangrove in fact is formed by the growing White-flower Derris. =Seaweeds= There are four main kinds of seaweeds in Hong Kong. They are Halophila beccarii (), Halophila ovalis (), Ruppia maritimia () and Dwarf eelgrass Zostera japonica () among which Zostera japonica was first found in Lai Chi Wo in 1979. Lai Chi Wo is the only place, and also the largest bed that we can find this kind of seaweed. This seaweed bed mat the shore for more than 2 hectares on the wild open mudflat. Seaweeds are precious in Hong Kong which mainly grow along the coast of northwest and northeast of New Territories. Seaweeds hold great importance to the eco-system because it provides shelter, food and feeding place for animals living along the coast, and besides, seaweeds can prevent soil and sand from being washed away. =Buttress roots= The structures shaped like wooden slabs are named as buttress roots. Several of them can be seen inside Lai Chi Wo Nature Trail. The taller the tree, or the poorer the growing environment, the larger and stronger these buttress trees grow. Lai Chi Wo Village =Five-finger Camphor (Cinnamomum Camphora)= The Camphor measures 25 metres tall and 3 metres in diameter. It gets its name because it had five branches like five fingers, although only four of them remain today. It was said that during Japanese Occupation, when Lai Chi Wo was occupied as a military backup base for the Japanese Army, the Japanese cut down many trees for fear that their enemies will hide near the area and make sudden attacks. When the soldiers threatened to chop this five-finger Camphor, the villagers stood up to protected the tree with their lives. Therefore, only one of the \\"fingers\\" has been cut. =The Hollow Tree (Autumn Maple)= The Hollow Tree is a more than one-hundred-year-old maple. It reaches a 21-metre high and 1.7-metre in diameter. It is called \\"hollow tree\\" because it has a huge hole inside the tree. The hole has openings in both upper and lower section of the tree. It is once said that there was a honeycomb and villagers tried to fire the comb but finally fired the tree altogether. However, the explanations from the description board of the tree told another cause. The parenchya cells in the centre of the trunk contracted and withered as a result of infection. Small holes began to appear inside the tree. However, the nutrients and moisture transporting cells around the exterior part of the trunk continued to grow and thicken. The trunk later get thicker, and the centre hollow expanded in tandem. Transportation  Ferry  A ferry service runs between Ma Liu Shui (Landing Steps No. 3) to Lai Chi Wo on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays. Visitors who carry the Sha Tau Kok permit can travel to Lai Chi Wo through boats. They can first go to Sha Tau Kok using KMB bus route 78K or Green mini-bus 55K.  Hiking  Alternatively, Lai Chi Wo can be reached by hiking via one of the two popular hiking routes. The first hiking route is from Wu Kau Tang, via Kau Tam Tso, Miu Tin and Lai Tau Shek. To get to Wu Kau Tang, hikers may use: * Green mini-bus route 20R (daily route) from Tai Po Market Station * KMB Bus route 275R (served on Sundays and holidays only; no service on non-holiday Mondays-Saturdays), from Tai Po Market Station The second hiking route is from Luk Keng, which green mini-bus 56K serves.

The centre ran for 15 years until his death in 2005, during which time over 500 students trained there, most of whom have since found work in the entertainment industry. History The ARTTS International Plaque After working many years in the theatre and television industry, Producer John Sichel fell out with the commissioners at the BBC due to his opinionated and strong views about quality over quantity and lack of originality in content being produced. In order to find what he felt would be a forum for creative output, John, along with co-founder and wife Elfie Sichel, converted a disused pig farm into a professional television, film, theatre and radio training facility, with the idea that learning should be by doing, rather than reading. \\"ARTTS\\" was an acronym for Advanced Residential Theatre & Television Skillcentre\\". It was designed for trainees to live and learn together in a professional environment. In fact, one accommodation block was a suitably converted pig stables. ARTTS opened in 1990 with 12 trainees, most of whom were interviewed before the facility had even been built. One of these trainees, Geoffrey Bicker, went on to become ARTTS Technical Director for over 10 years, and throughout this time ARTTS stood by its proud \\"94% Employment Record\\". Its on site training contained a 200-seat theatre, three television studios, a radio studio and full location equipment for television and 16mm and 35mm film. With an emphasis on the personal as well as the professional, trainees were pushed to learn the essentials of how to keep and maintain a job and reputation as someone continually employable whilst nurturing their creativity and remaining enthusiastic. Despite its constant financial battles, ARTTS continued to provide skills to around 50 trainees a year from all over the world. On 5 April 2005, John Sichel died and despite attempts to continue this legacy, spearheaded by not only Elfie but their daughters Katrina Sichel and Tanya Byron, and former graduates Derek Donohoe and Geoffrey Bicker, ARTTS closed down six months afterwards. Geoffrey and Derek went on to form AON Productions, continuing the corporate video work of ARTTS Productions. The site has been restored to a usable state and now is the basis for GSP Studios, a small film company based in Yorkshire.

Its lower level local authority is the civil parish of Wrington which is in North Somerset, England. It straddles the A38 Bridgwater-Bristol Road. It is about SSW of Bristol and close to Bristol Airport. History The earliest record of the name Redhill that has been found is on Day & Master's map of Somerset from as late as 1782. The name may simply derive from the appearance of the unmetalled road up the hill, with deep cartwheel ruts scored into the red earth. Alternatively the name may mean Roe Hill or Roe Hollow, alluding to the roe deer which are still plentiful in the area. Some dictionaries give the name as deriving from Ragiol, a village featured in the Domesday Book of 1086; this however, seems more likely to be Regil or Ridgehill. Prehistory There are at least three prehistoric structures in Redhill. There were at least six barrows here, though the mounds are less than high. A nearby long barrow is crossed by a field boundary at one end, and only about high. There are also remains of a burial chamber just south of Bristol Airport. The mound is almost gone but the cover slab remains ‚Äì with a hollow in it that collects the rainwater, giving its name The Water Stone ‚Äì burial chamber. Just south of the village, in the deep hollow and a quarter of a mile beyond the church is Lye Hole, where there is a stream of water, which runs into the Congresbury Yeo. It was the site, in July 1876 of the discovery of the remains of a Roman villa. At Lye Hole the enclosure system, often referred to as fields, implying that they represent cultivated infields, around the villa survives and is made up of long, rather narrow fields around broad. This was a settlement of the late Roman or Roman-Saxon era. Saxon and medieval period By late Saxon times and at the Norman Conquest in 1066, what is now known as Redhill comprised two of the three tythings of the Manor of Wrington (‚ÄúWeritone\\"). These were Lye Hole, to the East of the main Bridgwater Road, adjoining Butcombe and Broadfield Down, to the West. In the middle 13th century, a detailed list of the tenants of the manor shows 104 people holding from three to each; eight cottagers with a garden; three millers who also had land; one priest and four freeholders. There were some very small enclosed fields (called \\"crofts\\", \\"closes\\" or \\"paddocks\\" beside outlying farmsteads on Broadfield Down and in the Lye Cross and Lye Hole area. In the middle of the 16th century Calamine, a zinc ore, was found at Broadfield Down. It was then taken down the Banwell River and floated across the Bristol Channel to Tintern for smelting. With the use of gunpowder in the 17th century the extractions speeded up. Iron ore has been found during the excavations at Row of Ashes, on the boundary between Redhill and Butcombe, in the 1970s. Ore extraction and purification often utilised washing and settling lagoons, called buddles. Lye Hole Farm was referred to, as \\"the Washing Pool\\" or \\"at the Buddles\\" and there is still a field on Lye Hole Farm, called 'Uddles', which has a spring in it. Growth of the village The A38 has been one of the main links between Bristol and the South West of England since medieval days. It may even have far earlier roots ‚Äì linking the Roman settlement near Bristol with that at Exeter. Local roads prior to the 18th century were poor. For Redhill and the Bridgwater Road (A38), the first attempt to form a Turnpike Trusts was made in 1727 and again in 1731. Both were frustrated by local opposition, but the necessary Act (for Bristol) was eventually passed. John Macadam was appointed Surveyor to the Bristol Turnpike Trust in 1816 and his new process of covering the roads with a layer of crushed stone bound with tar and rolled smooth was quickly copied by all the other trusts. The Bell Inn (subsequently the Darlington Arms) provided facilities the stabling, watering and changing of horses, and carters cottages were built along the road. The nucleus of the present village arose at the crossroads of what is now Church Road, Winters Lane, Long Lane and The Pound ‚Äì which was so called because it was there that drovers would keep their livestock overnight as they travelled to market in Bristol. Winters Lane is thought to have once been the main road of Redhill leading up to the ancient settlement in Goblin Combe. The lane was also called \\"The Old Drove Road\\" and is still called \\"Cooks Bridle Path\\" at its far end where it enters Brockley Combe. It was \\"uncut\\" or unsurfaced until the 1920s. Many of the houses in the present village were built in the 20th century, but others ‚Äì especially the farms ‚Äì date back much further. Goblin Combe Farm, for instance, dates back to 1858. Scars Farm was built in 1884. Worship Farm was built in the 19th century. Quarry Farm, was built around 1900. Redhill Village Hall was built in 1911, with a gift of land and funds from Mr Henry Herbert Wills (of the W. D. & H. O. Wills tobacco family) family and furnished by the villagers. The Village Store used to be at \\"Banwells\\", opposite the Darlington Arms. A branch of the County Library was opened at the school in 1938 which was later replaced by a mobile van. Redcroft, a cul-de-sac off Winters Lane, consists of six houses and the parsonage ‚Äì all built around 1910 or 1911, the houses for the estate workers of Mr Henry Herbert Wills of Barley Wood, who had purchased much of the Wrington Estate on the death of the Fourth Duke of Cleveland (died 1891) when the estate was sold by auction (in 1896). Ashford Road (built in the 1930s) was originally planned to comprise 60 houses but the majority were never built. Second World War During World War II evacuees from London and Bristol were billeted in the village and the village hall was used for evacuees from Bristol air raids and as the HQ for the local Home Guard. Early in the 1939‚Äì1945 war, farmers on Broadfield Down received notice from the War Office that their land was to be taken over and used as a Royal Air Force (RAF) station. It was used throughout the war. In 1956, it was eventually purchased by Bristol City Council to become what is now Bristol Airport. After the Second World War electricity and mains water came to Redhill. Redacre, a cul-de-sac of six houses and bungalows, was built in 1964‚Äì65. 21st century In September 2008, a memorial concert for the singer Ian Stuart Donaldson of the neo-Nazi band Skrewdriver, attended by 800 people, was held in the fields of \\"The Bungalow Inn\\" public house. A marquee for the weekend- long billed \\"scooter and music festival\\" was erected by the Bungalow, after being contracted by record company \\"ISD records\\", which bills itself as the world's \\"oldest and most dependable White Nationalist Movement CD label.\\" The actual neo-Nazi-themed event was filmed by local residents, who have on video shouts of Sieg Heil from the rally inside \\"The Bungalow Inn\\" pub premises. At least two families resultantly fled their adjacent homes due to this and other bad behaviour. The owners of \\"The Bungalow\\" pub have been investigated before for smaller events, and the licensing of the event and other incidents are presently being investigated by Avon and Somerset Police. Governance Wrington parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. The parish falls within the unitary authority of North Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Woodspring district of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Axbridge Rural District.A Vision of Britain Through Time : Axbridge Rural District The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of the North Somerset constituency. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, currently Liam Fox of the Conservative Party. Geography Lye Hole Lane At the foot of Sutton Hill a brook rises nearby and flows past Lye Hole and Cowslip Green to join the River Yeo near Perry Bridge on the A38, Bridgwater Road . Education There was probably a school at Broadfield from the latter part of the 18th century, and a cottage, now demolished, called \\"The Old School House\\". The fees were one penny a week. This dame school was run by a Mrs Saunders for 19 years until the building of the new one in 1874. The school, built in 1874 cost ¬£811.12s 6d, plus ¬£50 for the architect, and was opened by the Bishop of Bath and Wells. The Duke of Cleveland, who owned the major part of Wrington Parish, gave the site. School numbers varied over the years from 105 in 1879 to 17 in 1937. By this time it had become a Junior School (as from 1927). The classrooms were heated by tortoise stoves until the arrival of night storage heaters. Redhill School had its centenary celebrations in 1975. Falling numbers of children of school age finally led to the decision being made to close the School on 20 July 1984 Culture Redhill hosts an annual Harvest Home festival. More than 50% of the community as at the 2011 census stated that they were Christian: 195 residents; the other faiths professed were no religion (32 residents) and Judaism and Islam with one resident of each of those faiths. Religious sites Before Christ Church was built in Redhill, worshippers had to go down to All Saints Church in Wrington, while from 1715 non-conformists used their own building. Christ Church, Redhill's chapel of ease was first erected in 1843 and consecrated in the following year by the Bishop of Salisbury. Built by James Wilson it is of Lancet style, with a west tower, a nave without aisles and a short chancel. The local inhabitants met its cost, with the Rector John Vane contributing the entire cost of the chancel, porch and tower. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II listed building, Its exposure to the prevailing west winds meant that rain was soon permeating the porous local limestone. In 1869, the church had to be closed so that the walls could be lined with pitch and replastered inside. The board in the church porch states that there were \\"315 seats, 250 of which are hereby declared to be free and unappropriated for ever\\". A new organ was installed in 1888 at a cost of ¬£200.

The community is the home of the Harlansburg Station Transportation Museum http://www.harlansburgstation.com/ and the Harlansburg cave, reputedly the longest cave in Pennsylvania.http://www.caves.org/pub/journal/PDF/V59/V59N3-Fawley.pdf The following historical text is taken from History of Lawrence County Pennsylvania, 1887, which is now in the public domain.http://www.rootsweb.com/~usgenweb/pa/lawrence/1887/1887-07.htm#harlans  Harlansburg  Is located on the old Pittsburgh and Erie stage road, which was one of the first roads laid out in the county. The road was the main stage route, and travel over it, after the country had become partially settled, was very heavy. The first settler at the place was Jonathan Harlan, who left Chester County in 1792, and came to Allegheny county, locating in the beautiful Chartiers valley. He was in that county during the excitement caused by the \\"whisky insurrection\\" of 1794, and was in the neighborhood when Gen. John Neville's house was burnt by the insurrectionists He came to what is now called Scott Township, about 1797-8, and settled under Dr. Peter Mowry, of Pittsburgh, including the site of the village. He afterwards removed to the farm now owned by the heirs of George McCracken. While living on his first tract he laid out the town of Harlansburg in 1800, built the first house in the place, and put up a gristmill just east of the village, on the small run which empties into Slippery Rock Creek, some distance below, the mill being built probably previous to the laying out of the town. The house he built was constructed of round logs, and stood on the hill just above where the \\"Benard House\\" now stands. The house was standing until about 1840. When Mr. Harlan came to the place he brought with him his wife and three children, and seven children were afterwards added to the number, the first born after their settlement being a daughter, Sarah. After Mr. Harlan removed to the farm, below town, he built a second grist-mill, already mentioned. About the same time Harlan came Abraham and Levi Hunt made a settlement on a farm adjoining him, and Abraham Hunt, in 1802, built the first tavern in the village, the building still standing, and known as the \\"Benard House.\\" It was the first frame building for many miles around, and has been used as a tavern ever since it was erected. The HUNTs afterward removed to a farm in the neighborhood or where the Deans now live, a couple of miles west of the village. William Elder came to Harlansburg about 1807-8, two or three years after his father, John Elder, settled in the township. He soon after opened a small general store, in a space of about five by ten feet, where the bar now is in the \\"Benard House.\\" A postoffice was established in the village, probably about 1811-12, and Mr. Elder also had the honor of being the first postmaster, so far as can be learned from those who remember. John Bently came from Chester county in 1814, and, with his wife and six children - five boys and a girl - located in the village. Robert Bently, Esq., the oldest son, has lived within three miles (5 km) of the place ever since, and is now living in the village. A log school house was erected about 1820, and the first teacher was an Irishman named David Gourley. Before this, schools had been kept in private houses. Joseph Campbell taught a small school in his own house about 1815-16, and James McCune always kept one in his house. In the winter of 1818, William Jack taught a school east of town, in a house which was built by John Martin for a dwelling. During the winter of 1818-19, snow fell to the depth of twenty-six inches, and unless the snow of the present winter equals it, the like has not been known since. So say the \\"old residents.\\" A two-story brick school house was built on the hill, in the western part of the village, in the neighborhood of 1857, and is still standing. The school has been run as a high-school most of the time since, and, at present, has an average attendance of about one hundred. A hewn log church was built by some German families as early as 1799. Among the churches next in age is the Methodist Episcopal Church, which was originated in 1834. The first church building was a frame structure put up for a dwelling by John Boyd. The third church in age was a Cumberland Presbyterian church, which was organized about 1836. The congregation became so small that they ceased to meet as a church congregation in 1865. The U.P. church, a short distance from the village, was built in 1855, although the congregation was organized about 1852. The building is a brick one. The Cumberland Presbyterians sold their church to the Presbyterians who organized a congregation in Harlansburg about 1875. The first blacksmith shop was started by John SMITH, in 1816, south of the village. The first one in town was started by Jesse Bentley, in 1831. Charles Book operated the first wagon shop in 1862. Ira Emerson opened the first boot and shoe shop, which James Sturling had the first tailor shop in 1833. The Harlansburg Agricultural and Horticultural Association was organized in 1871, and of land leased. Fairs were held until some ten years ago, when the company dissolved. The population of Harlansburg is about two hundred. A railroad which would develop the coal and mineral lands in this neighborhood would be great value to the growth of the town. ;Ramsey Brothers The present firm organized in April, 1887, when David G., and Richard M. Ramsey purchased the general merchandise of J.G. Jordan at Harlansburg. The brothers are sons of Richard Ramsey, deceased, 1861. The brothers are natives of Plaingrove township, where they were raised and attended school. David G., was born October 4, 1853, while Richard M., was born on May 3, 1857. David was married to Miss Nettie Cunningham, September 2, 1878, and is the father of four children, all at home. Richard was married January 31, 1884, to Miss Lida Brown, and is the father of two children. Ramsey Brother's store is well stocked with dry goods, notions, boots, shoes, groceries, and everything usually found in a first-class general merchandise store. They carry an unusually large stock which they sell at the very lowest possible prices. The Ramsey Brothers have been long known in this part of the county as careful and honest business men, whom it is always safe to patronize. ;James Burnside Was born May 11, 1818, in Slipperyrock Township, one mile (1.6 km) and a half from Princeton. His father was Samuel Bunrside, deceased, who came to this country from Ireland in 1817. In 1868 James Burnside came to Harlansburg and bought the hotel property from Michael and Henry Jordan. Mr. Burnside has thus been in the hotel business in Harlansburg for nearly twenty years. He was married in 1848 to Catherine Howe, of Butler County and to them ten children were born, seven of whom are living as follows: Samuel H., married, of Harlansburg; Robert F., at home; Fannie Glass, of Harlansburg; John A., James E., William H., and Joseph P., all at home. Mr. and Mrs. Burnside are a pleasant old couple. They run a good hotel and are well thought of by all who know them. Other businessmen include: John Eppinger, the blacksmith, has been in the village many years and is a good workman. Brown & Caldwell, the general merchants, purchased the general store of David Ramsey, in 1886, and have been running it ever since. J.J. Ramsey, who was the former partner of J.G. Jordan in the general merchandise business, has the only drug store in town and does a good business. Washington Cunningham, the furniture dealer and undertaker, has been in Harlansburg over sixty-five years and has been in the business the most of that time.

Life Born in Dessau, M√ºller made a living in the last two decades of the nineteenth century by selling lemons (in German Zitronen) on the Grasbrook during the day and at nights in the pubs of the Neustadt. Her famous call while she sold the lemons was Zitroon! Zitroon!. Due to drunkenness and mental illness, in August 1894 she was sent to the Friedrichsberg asylum.

In Judaism these are the basic works of rabbinic literature. The tractate of Ta'anit is devoted chiefly to the fast-days, their practices and prayers. In most editions of the Talmud this treatise is the ninth in the mishnaic order of Seder Mo'ed, and is divided into four chapters containing thirty-four folio in all. The following is a summary of its contents: Summary of the Mishnah and Babylonian Talmud Chapter 1: Concerning the date on which one begin to mention rain in the second blessing of Shemoneh Esreh and to pray for rain in the eighth blessing (1:1-3); the time during which one fasts on account of scarcity of rain‚Äîtwo successive periods of three days each, and a final one of seven days‚Äîand the distinctions between these various days with regard to strictness in fasting (1:4-6); nature of the national mourning in case no rain falls despite many fast-days (1:7). Chapter 2: The ceremonies which must be observed in fasting (2:1); the prayers and the blowing of the trumpet in this connection (2:2-5); the participation of the priests both in the fasts of three days and in that of seven days (2:6-7); days on which public fasts are prohibited according to Megillat Taanit (2:8-10). Ch. 3: Cases in which the order of fasting may be changed, and the trumpet may be blown at the very beginning of the fast (3:1-3); other occasions on which a fast is held and the trumpet blown, as when a plague breaks out in a city or when an army marches against it (3:4-7); concerning Honi HaMe'agel, who prayed for rain (3:8); cases in which fasting ceases when rain begins to fall (3:9). Ch. 4: Days on which the priests raise their hands four times to bless the people (4:1); the institution of lay assistants (\\"ma'amadot\\") for the sacrifice, the time when they assembled, the days on which they fasted, and the sections of Scripture which they read on each day (4:2-4); the day of the month appointed for the bringing of the wood-offering (Nehemiah 10:34) during the period of the Temple (4:5); the Seventeenth of Tammuz and Tisha B'av, and the five sad events which befell the Jewish people on each of these days (4:6-7); the festivities which marked Yom Kippur and Tu B'av (the most important day of the wood-offering) in ancient times in Jerusalem, when the maidens, dressed in white, danced in the vineyards and called on the young men to seek worthy brides for themselves (4:8). Other Talmudic literature The Tosefta to this treatise contains much that elucidates and supplements the Mishnah. Especially noteworthy are the account of the origin of the priestly classes (4:2), the changes which affected them after the return from exile, and how they were again subdivided (2:1). The two Gemaras contain, in addition to the explanations of individual mishnayot, many aggadic sayings, as well as many narratives and legends. The following sayings from the Babylonian Gemara may be cited here: \\"Why is learning compared to a fire? Because, as many chips burn better together than singly, so learning is promoted when it is pursued by many scholars studying in company.\\" \\"A sage who holds himself aloof from other scholars deteriorates learning.\\" \\"R. Hanina said he had learned much from his teachers, but more from his colleagues, and most of all from his pupils.\\" \\"Learning is like water; for as water can not remain in a high place, so learning can not be the possession of a proud and haughty man\\" (7a). \\"If a pupil finds study difficult, it is only because he has not systematically arranged the material to be learned\\" (8a). \\"If when Israel is visited with affliction a man severs fellowship with his brethren, the two angels who accompany each one come to him, lay their hands upon his head, and say: 'This man would not suffer with his people; therefore he shall not behold them when they are comforted and see days of happiness'\\" (11a). Among the narratives particular attention should be given to the story of Nicodemus b. Gorion (19b-20a) and to the legend of Honi the Circledrawer, who slept for seventy years (23a). Noteworthy in Talmud Yerushalmi is the account of the three scrolls of the Law which were in the Temple in Jerusalem and which differed from one another in various passages. Where two of these scrolls agreed as regards a reading, it was accepted as the correct text (4:2, 20b or 68a). This Gemara contains also a remarkable saying of R. Abbahu, which is evidently directed against Christianity: \\"If a man says, 'I am God,' he lies; and if he says, 'I am the son of man,' he will have to repent; and if he says, 'I shall go up to heaven,' he will not do it, nor achieve what he promises\\" (2:1, 9a or 65b). It likewise relates how Simon bar Kokhba killed Eleazar of Modi'im, whom a Samaritan had falsely accused of treason.

It can cause bone deformity including short stature and genu varum (bow-leggedness). It is associated with a mutation in the PHEX gene sequence (Xp.22) and subsequent inactivity of the PHEX protein. The leg deformity can be treated with Ilizarov frames and CAOS. It is also treated with medications including human growth hormone, calcitriol, and phosphate. The prevalence of the disease is 1 in 20,000. Symptoms and signs The most common symptoms of XLH affect the bones, causing pain, abnormal shape, and osteoarthritis. It is also associated with hearing impairment and problems with the teeth, including abscesses, interglobular dentin, and a large dental pulp.  Genetics  XLH is associated with a mutation in the PHEX gene sequence, located on the human X chromosome at location Xp22.2-p22.1. The PHEX protein regulates another protein called fibroblast growth factor 23 (produced from the FGF23 gene). Fibroblast growth factor 23 normally inhibits the kidneys' ability to reabsorb phosphate into the bloodstream. Gene mutations in PHEX prevent it from correctly regulating fibroblast growth factor 23. The resulting overactivity of FGF-23 reduces vitamin D 1Œ±-hydroxylation and phosphate reabsorption by the kidneys, leading to hypophosphatemia and the related features of hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets. Also in XLH, where PHEX enzymatic activity is absent or reduced, osteopontin‚Äîa mineralization-inhibiting secreted substrate protein found in the extracellular matrix of bone‚Äîaccumulates in bone (and teeth) to contribute to the osteomalacia (and odontomalacia) as shown in the mouse homolog (Hyp) of XLH and in XLH patients. Biochemically in blood, XLH is recognized by hypophosphatemia and an inappropriately low level of calcitriol (1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3). Patients often have bowed legs or knock knees in which they usually cannot touch both knees and ankles together at the same time. The disorder is inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder (PHEX) is located on the X chromosome, and only one copy of the defective gene is sufficient to cause the disorder when inherited from a parent who has the disorder. Males are normally hemizygous for the X chromosome, having only one copy. As a result, X-linked dominant disorders usually show higher expressivity in males than females. As the X chromosome is one of the sex chromosomes (the other being the Y chromosome), X-linked inheritance is determined by the sex of the parent carrying a specific gene and can often seem complex. This is because, typically, females have two copies of the X-chromosome and males have only one copy. The difference between dominant and recessive inheritance patterns also plays a role in determining the chances of a child inheriting an X-linked disorder from their parentage. Diagnosis Begin clinical laboratory evaluation of rickets with assessment of serum calcium, phosphate, and alkaline phosphatase levels. In hypophosphatemic rickets, calcium levels may be within or slightly below the reference range; alkaline phosphatase levels will be significantly above the reference range. Carefully evaluate serum phosphate levels in the first year of life, because the concentration reference range for infants (5.0-7.5 mg/dL) is high compared with that for adults (2.7-4.5 mg/dL). Serum parathyroid hormone levels are within the reference range or slightly elevated, while calcitriol levels are low or within the lower reference range. Most importantly, urinary loss of phosphate is above the reference range. The renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TRP) in X-linked hypophosphatemia is 60%; normal TRP exceeds 90% at the same reduced plasma phosphate concentration. The TRP is calculated with the following formula: 1 - [Phosphate Clearance (CPi) / Creatinine Clearance (Ccr)] X 100  Treatment  Oral phosphate, calcitriol; in the event of severe bowing, an osteotomy may be performed to correct the leg shape. The monoclonal antibody Burosumab was licensed in 2018 as the first drug specifically for this condition.

Before 1629, the area belonged to Prince Gagarin, then it passed to Maksim Streshnev, a cousin of Tsarina Eudoxia Streshneva. Upon the death of Maksim's grandson in 1692, the ownership passed sideways to a cousin, Tikhon Streshnev. It was he who commissioned a singular five-domed church to be built there in 1698-1704. Its four-petaled plan was of Ukrainian Baroque inspiration; but all five towers are equal in height and crowned by typical Russian onion domes. This five-towered church, dedicated to the Theotokos of Kazan, is quite extraordinary in Russian architecture. Its design is attributed to Osip Startsev, who was responsible for some of the major Baroque cathedrals of Kyiv but also worked in Moscow. Tikhon's granddaughter Sophie was the last of her race; she married Prince Galitzine, whose son Alexis built a Baroque residence flanked by two wings. Alexis also built a regular park on the grounds and laid out a series of ponds. His daughter Marie was wife of Count Pyotr Aleksandrovich Tolstoy, who received Uzkoe as a dowry and had a larch alley planted there. In the mid-19th century the estate passed through marriage to the Troubetzkoys who had the old country house swept away and replaced with a Neoclassical mansion, which borrowed many details from its predecessor. It was there that the Russian philosopher Vladimir Solovyov died in 1900. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Troubetzkoys were expelled from Uzkoe and their estate was given over to the Soviet Academy of Sciences, which has used it as a rest home for its members.

It is located west of the intersection of State Road A1A and Mala Compra Drive at Bings Landing County Park in Flagler County. On March 5, 2004, it was added to the United States National Register of Historic Places. Mala Compra (Spanish for \\"bad bargain\\" or \\"bad purchase\\") was formerly part of one of northeastern Florida's largest plantation systems (totaling 2,265 acres). Situated on the coast, it belonged to Joseph Marion Hern√°ndez (1788‚Äì1857), and was worked primarily as a forced-labor cotton plantation from 1816 through 1836, when the Seminoles burned it down near the beginning of the Second Seminole War. Preliminary archaeological investigations were conducted at the Mala Compra site in 1999. The study identified the house where Hern√°ndez and his family resided when they were not at their home in St. Augustine, and the detached kitchen was also found. The land for the plantation was purchased by Hern√°ndez in 1816; cotton and corn were grown there until the settlement was destroyed by marauding Native Americans. The main dwelling-house was described in historical accounts as a 1 1/2-story framed structure with a masonry foundation. Investigations revealed that the building had a coquina block foundation in the eastern part while masonry footers supported the western section. It was almost twice the size of the dimensions cited in the historical descriptions. Wooden floors had been described as well, and traces of them were found, but tabby concrete surfaces were also identified. An account of the state of the plantation in 1836 given by Joseph S. Sanchez to the County Court of St. Johns County in 1837 says that his militia troops found a number of oxen, cattle, and horses; garden enclosures and cattle pens; and \\"an extensive and thriving sweet orange grove, said to contain 1,500 trees, and a variety of other fruit trees...\\". Over 14,000 artifacts were recovered by archaeologists and their assistants, including fragments of ceramics and wine bottles, kitchen utensils, kaolin pipes, hinges, nails, and gun parts. The main house and kitchen have been interpreted to provide an interactive historical exhibit for public education and recreation, and plans developed for additional research and preservation of the valuable cultural resources. History Map of Spanish Land Grant to Joseph M. Hernandez showing Mala Compra In 1816, the Spanish government granted Hern√°ndez a large tract of land at the confluence of Graham's Swamp and what was then the headwaters of the southern end of the Matanzas River, on its western bank. There he cultivated about 700 acres of sugarcane, calling the place St. Joseph plantation. According to a deed dated March 11, 1816, for 1,500 pesos in cash Father Miguel Crosby sold Hern√°ndez 800 acres on the coastal barrier island, described as \\"800 acres with its adjoining marshes on the Matanzas River, bounded on the north by lands of John Bautista Ferreyra\\".Payne Griffin 1999, p. 32 The name \\"Mala Compra\\" had been given previously to the property by another owner. In 1818, Hern√°ndez bought from Ferreyra's son, Francis Ferreira (spelling of these names varied, often in the same document), another property of 375 acres adjoining Mala Compra called Bella Vista. Ferreira was a sea captain who trafficked enslaved African people in Florida. The soil of the cotton fields at Mala Compra was said to have been as white and sandy after some years as the Atlantic beach, yet still produced abundant crops of Sea Island cotton. This was high hammock land where the original growth was almost exclusively Southern live oak. Hern√°ndez' country residence was the plantation house at Mala Compra, a 1 1/2-story frame structure built on a coquina block foundation measuring 18 by 30 feet and laid three feet deep; the side facing the river had a long, wide porch. The interior of the house had two fireplaces built of brick and coquina, plastered walls and paneled doors. The detached kitchen was also 18 by 30 feet, it had a terraced first floor and a loft used for curing tobacco. There was a wooden-framed warehouse for cotton on the property that could hold 200,000 pounds of seed and 200 bales of ginned cotton. Agricultural equipment included single- and double-horse gins and 24-foot-gins, in which the horses trod a path 24 feet in circumference. There were other buildings including a corn crib, a driver's house, and a privy, as well as cabins for people enslaved as forced laborers. The American Coot from The Birds of America. Plate CCCV ‚Äî Male. Hern√°ndez was Florida's first delegate to the U.S. Congress in 1822 and 1823 and the first Hispanic to serve in the United States Congress. He was a brigadier general commanding troops of the Florida MilitiaCongress 1839, p. 127 during the Second Seminole War, who while negotiating with Seminole leader Osceola under a white flag of truce in October 1837, took him captive by order of General Jesup. It was from Mala Compra that Hernandez wrote a letter to Dr. William H. Simmons, dated April 15, 1830, on the cultivation of Cuban tobacco. Simmons and John Lee Williams of Pensacola were commissioned by the second Territorial Council of Florida to select a central point between St. Augustine and Pensacola to serve as capital of the territory in 1823. In 1831, John James Audubon spent ten days as a guest of Hern√°ndez at Mala Compra. There he shot dozens of American coots, one of which was a male from which he drew the figure for the plate which appeared in his book The Birds of America. In 1832 the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida incorporated a company to dig a canal from the head of Matanzas Lagoon to Smith's Creek, a tributary of the Halifax River. With this act a memorial was presented to Congress seeking financial assistance and land grants; subsequently five sections were appropriated for the proposed canal. The company intended to commence the canal at Mala Compra plantation and dig it southward a distance of about 11 or 12 miles through a rich wet savanna, parallel with the coast, to Smith's Creek, about four miles north of John Bulow's plantation. J. Lee Williams map of 1837, showing location of Mala Compra In the early stages of the Second Seminole War, during the winter of 1835 and 1836, and in the spring of the latter year, both Mala Compra and St. Joseph plantations were taken into military possession by the United States, and the houses occupied and fortified as military posts. During that winter and spring, both places were occupied, evacuated, and reoccupied by various detachments and bodies of troops. The troops seized and ate the large quantities of corn, hay, sugarcane, and cattle stored on the farm. In the spring, the Seminoles, taking advantage of a temporary evacuation, burned all the buildings of any consequence or value on the sugarcane plantation. At Mala Compra, they burned the cotton warehouse that had been prepared and used as a defensive fortification. They captured three of the 80 people enslaved on the plantation and drove the rest off.

The duo of co-hosts consisted of Jesse Dylan and Gene Valaitis. History Q107 The show first began airing on Q107 on 5 September 1986, replacing Brother Jake Edwards in the station's morning slot. 680 CFTR: move to afternoons on AM dial In June 1989, the show's move to CFTR- AM, a Top-40 music station branded as \\"All Hits 680 CFTR\\", got announced. Beginning from July 1989, the show aired live daily between 2 p.m. and 7 p.m., encompassing the afternoon drive time slot. Toronto press reported on CFTR's financial terms that lured the duo away from Q107 as being lucrative. Starting from 17 June 1991, Jesse and Gene became CFTR's new morning show following the retirement of the station's longtime morning man Tom Rivers. When CFTR changed its format to an all news station in June 1993, re-branding as 680 News, Jesse and Gene were let go along with most of the on-air personnel. AM 640 The duo immediately got picked up by CHOG-AM, a station owned by Western International Communications (WIC) and operated through its subsidiary Westcom Radio Group. As announced by the company's programming vice president Danny Kingsbury, Jesse and Gene debuted in CHOG's morning slot on 21 June 1993 while the station's previous morning man Adrian Bell got moved to mid-days. Branded as \\"AM 640: The Beat Of Toronto\\", the station was a bit of a dinosaur in the Toronto market as the last remaining Top 40 station in the city and the last AM station in Greater Toronto Area to play the contemporary hits music format. Broadcasting out of the recently built Yonge-Norton Centre office tower in the North York area of Toronto, the duo posted strong ratings right away, coming in third in the Toronto market during January 1994 with 131,000 listeners in their peak quarter-hour, behind only Andy Barrie's 285,000 on CFRB-AM and Erin Davis' 143,000 on CHFI-FM. In 1994, the show received complaints of racism over a skit that aired on 30 March 1994 involving an impersonation of Canadian Member of Parliament Jag Bhaduria singing songs by The Beatles with altered lyrics about his politically controversial situation in a strong Indian accent. The complaints were sent to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) who later referred it to the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC). The CBSC later found that \\"the spot was a parody of a particular politician, and was not abusive or discriminatory toward people of any national or ethnic origin\\".http://www.cbsc.ca/chog-am-re- the-jessie-and-gene-show/ The duo got a small alley named after them in May 1994. Located in North York, then a city within Metropolitan Toronto, Jesse and Gene Way runs parallel to Yonge Street from Norton Avenue until Church Avenue. On 19 July 1995, in preparation for its upcoming format switch, AM 640 announced cancellation of Jesse and Gene with Jesse Dylan saying his goodbyes on air. Gene Valaitis stayed on at the station, getting paired with Jane Hawtin for a new show in the 5:30 to 9 a.m. slot starting after Labour Day 1995 as AM 640 changed its format to full-time talk radio, becoming \\"Talk 640\\" in October 1995, including a call letter change from CHOG to CFYI. Return to Q107 Jesse and Gene reunited in July 1996 as the returning hosts of Q107's morning show. For Gene Valaitis, the reunion meant getting internally re-assigned from CFYI-AM to Q107-FM (both stations were owned by the same corporate entity, Western International Communications, at the time) thus breaking up his ten-month morning pairing with Jane Hawtin. Less than a year after bringing them back, Q107 released Jesse and Gene with their last show airing on 5 May 1997, marking the end of their radio careers together. Rory O'Shea took over the morning slot on a temporary basis. Following a three month search for a permanent replacement, Q107's management decided to start simulcasting The Howard Stern Show from 2 September 1997. During their broadcast tenure, they released compilation albums that featured classic skits & prank phone calls from their shows, their last one entitled Jesse and Gene: Greatest Bits. Currently, Dylan is the host of a syndicated radio show called The Good Life Show based in Vancouver, British Columbia. Valaitis lives in Los Angeles, California. Jesse and Gene re-united for a three-night appearance on CFRB from November 11 to 13, 2009, filling in for Ryan Doyle from 7:00 pm to 10:00 pm.

He is a widely known spiritual figure in various Indian states including Maharashtra. He lived during the nineteenth century. Swami Samarth traveled all across the Indian subcontinent and eventually set his abode at Akkalkot, a village in present-day Maharashtra. He is thought to have initially arrived at Akkalkot on a Wednesday, during either September or October in 1856. He resided at Akkalkot for close to 22 years. His parentage and origins remain obscure. Some other Indian saints and spiritual figures including Sai Baba of Shirdi and Gajanan Maharaj of Shegaon also have similarly unknown origins. According to legend, once when a disciple asked Swami a question about his birth, Swami responded that he had originated from a banyan tree (vata-vriksha in Marathi). On another occasion, Swami had said that his earlier name was Nrusimha Bhan. Legend Swami Samarth is widely considered to be the fourth (third in physical form) incarnation of Dattatreya, an Indian monk, mystic and Hindu deity. He is also believed to be a reincarnation of Narasimha Saraswati, another earlier spiritual master of the Dattatreya sect. Life A painting depicting a meeting between Swami Samarth and Manik Prabhu's under the holy cluster fig (Audumbar in Marathi) tree at Maniknagar According to Swami Samarth himself, he had originally appeared in the Kardali forests near Srisailam, a Hindu holy town in present- day Andhra Pradesh. He might have moved through China, Tibet and Nepal during his travels across the Himalayas and its adjacent regions. He is also believed to have visited various Indian regions such as Puri, Varanasi (also Kashi), Haridwar, Girnar, Kathiawar and Rameswaram. He might have also briefly lived at Mangalvedha, a town near Pandharpur in present-day Solapur district, Maharashtra. He finally settled at Akkalkot.Hanumante, Mukund M. (1999). A Glimpse of Divinity: Shri Swami Samarth Maharaj of Akkalkot. Kenner, USA: Akkalkot Swami Samarth Foundation Swami Samarth is also believed to have visited Maniknagar, Karnataka to meet Manik Prabhu, an Indian saint and mystic considered to be another incarnation of Dattatreya.http://manikprabhu.org/shri-manik-prabhu-maharaj/ According to the Shree Manik Prabhu Charitra (biography), Swami resided at Maniknagar for around six months. During this period, Manik Prabhu and Swami Samarth often sat under a cluster fig tree (Audumbar in Marathi) and had conversations on profound spirituality. It is claimed that Swami Samarth regarded Manik Prabhu as a brother. http://www.shreeswami.org/avatars/shri-manik-prabhu-maharaj/ Swami Samarth probably arrived at Akkalkot in 1856 on receiving an invitation from Chintopant Tol and then stayed on the outskirts of the town for about 22 years. He usually lived at the residence of his disciple Cholappa, where his shrine is presently located. A common mantra commemorating Swami Samarth is read as ‚ÄúOm Abhayadata Shree Swamisamarthaya Namaha‚Äù. His biography known as Shree Guruleelamrut was authored by Sant Wamanbhau Maharaj.

In 154 BC, the Roman senate objected to the Belli town of Segeda building a circuit of walls, and declared war. At least three tribes of Celtiberians were involved in the war: the Titti, the Belli (towns of Segeda and Nertobriga) and the Averaci (towns of Numantia, Axinum and Ocilis). After some initial Celtiberian victories, the consul Marcus Claudius Marcellus inflicted some defeats and made peace with the Celtiberians. The next consul, Lucius Licinius Lucullus, attacked the Vaccaei, a tribe living in the central Duero valley which was not at war with Rome. He did so without the authorisation of the senate, with the excuse that the Vaccaei had mistreated the Carpetani. The Second Celtiberian War overlapped with the Lusitanian War of 155‚Äì150 BC. Causes The classical sources put the blame of starting the Second Celtiberian War on the city of Segeda (near Zaragoza). Appian wrote that the war broke out because this powerful city of the Celtiberian tribe of the Belli persuaded the people of some smaller towns to settle there and was building a circuit of walls seven kilometres long. It also forced the neighbouring Titti to join in. The Belli had agreed to the treaties Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus had made with tribes in Hispania at the end of the First Celtiberian War. Rome considered that Segeda was breaking the treaty. It forbade the building of the wall, demanded the tribute and the provision of a contingent for the Roman army in accordance with the stipulations of Gracchus' treaty. The Segedans replied that the treaty forbade the construction of new towns, but did not forbid the fortification of existing ones. They also said that they had been subsequently released from the tribute and the military contingent by the Romans. This was true, but the senate argued that when it granted such exemptions it always specified that they were to continue only during its pleasure.Appian, Roman History, The foreign Wars, Book 6, The Spanish wars, 44 Classical sources also comment on other movements and seditions by other cities in the Celtiberian territories, and grave problems in Hispania Ulterior, where Punicus headed a Luso-Vettonic coalition against Rome.Enrique Garc√≠a Riaza \\"La expansi√≥n romana en Celtiberia\\" It is generally understood then, that the senate decision was so strict not only because it was fearful about the development of Segeda into a powerful city, but also because it was afraid of the development of a large scale rebellion in Hispania. Victories of the Celtiberian coalition Expecting a long war in Hispania, the Senate decided in 153 BC for the first time that the election of the magistrates would take place on 1 January, instead of 15 March. This allowed Quintus Fabius Nobilitor to arrive in Hispania and start his campaign early in the year. The people of Segeda, whose wall had not been completed, fled and sought refuge among the Arevaci of Numantia (7 km north of Soria), who welcomed them. The Arevaci initially tried to mediate, but Nobilitor would only accept complete surrender (deditio). Consequently, the Celtiberians raised an army of 20,000 infantry and 500 cavalry, and chose a Segedan, Carus, as its commander. He prepared for an ambush in a thick forest and attacked the nearly 30,000-strong Roman army of Nobilitor. It was a long battle, which the Celtiberians won; 6,000 Romans were killed. Carus was killed together with 6,000 of his men by the Roman cavalry which was guarding the Roman baggage while he was pursuing the fugitives from the battle in a disorderly manner. Nevertheless, the battle was a disaster for the Romans and from then on they would not engage in battle on the day of the festival of the god Vulcan because this defeat occurred on that day.Appian, Roman History, The foreign Wars, Book 6, The Spanish wars, 45 The Arevaci assembled at the town of Numantia which had strong natural defences, and chose Ambo and Leuco as their leaders. Three days later Nobilitor encamped four kilometres from the town. He was joined by 300 cavalry and ten elephants sent by Masinissa, the king of Numidia, a Roman ally in Africa. Before the ensuing battle Nobilitor placed the elephants at the rear so that they would not be seen and then divided the army into two. During the battle he brought them into view. This frightened the enemy, who had never seen these animals. They fled inside the town. Nobilitor attacked the city walls and there was a fierce battle. Then an elephant was hit by a large falling stone and made a loud noise which frightened the other elephants. They went on the rampage, trampling over the Romans, who took to disorderly flight. The Numantines made a sortie and killed 4,000 Romans and three elephants. Nobilitor then attacked the town of Axinium which stored the enemy supplies, but did not achieve anything. He lost many men and returned to his camp at night. He sent his cavalry commander to pursue an alliance with a neighbouring tribe and ask for cavalry assistance. He was given some horsemen, but an ambush was prepared against him when he was on his way back. The allied horsemen fled and the Roman commander and many of his troops were killed. These Roman disasters encouraged the town of Ocilis (Medinaceli, also in the modern province of Soria) to defect to the Celtiberians. The Roman provisions were kept in this town. Nobilitor withdrew to his winter camp and suffered food shortages. Because of this, as well as heavy snowstorms and frost, many of his men died.Appian, Roman History, The foreign Wars, Book 6, The Spanish wars, 46-7 In 152 BC Marcus Claudius Marcellus, consul for the third time, took over the command, bringing 8,000 infantry and 500 cavalry to Hispania. An ambush against him was prepared, but he avoided it by moving cautiously and he encamped in front of Ocilis. He seized the town, granted it pardon, took hostages and imposed a fine of thirty talents. His moderation encouraged the people of Nertobriga (a town of the Belli, in the modern province of Zaragoza) to ask for peace. Marcellus asked for 100 cavalry and they agreed. However, in the meantime the Roman rear guard was attacked and a lot of booty was taken. When the promised cavalry arrived its leaders said that this had been done by some people who did not know about the agreement with the Romans. Marcellus chained the horsemen, sold their horses, plundered the countryside and began to besiege the town, which sent a herald to ask for peace again. Marcellus stated that he would not grant peace unless the Arevaci, Belli, and Titti asked for it together. The Nertobriges sent ambassadors to these tribes and asked Marcellus for leniency and for the renewal of the treaty made with Gracchus. This was opposed by some rural people who had been incited to war. Marcellus sent envoys from each party to Rome to carry on their dispute there and sent private letters to the senate urging peace. He wanted to bring the war to an end himself and gain glory this way.Appian, Roman History, The foreign Wars, Book 6, The Spanish wars, 47-8 The Celtiberians send envoys to Rome and agree to stop hostilities Appian wrote that the envoys of the friendly faction were treated as guests in the city, whereas those of the hostile faction were lodged outside the city walls, as customary. Polybius specified that it was the Belli and Titti who had taken the side of Rome. Because of this their envoys were admitted into the city, while those of the Arevaci, as they were enemies, were ordered to encamp on the other side of the River Tiber. The Senate heard the friendly envoys first. They said that if the rebels were not punished properly they would soon take up arms again and make the whole of Hispania inclined to rebel. They asked either that the Roman army should remain in Hispania and that it should be commanded by a consul to check the depredations of the Arevaci or, if the troops were to be withdrawn, that Rome should inflict an exemplary punishment on them. According to Polybius, when the envoys of the Arevaci were heard, they came across as not being willing to submit or to accept defeat and gave the impression that they thought that they had fought more brilliantly than the Romans. They said that they would pay a penalty, should it be imposed on them, but demanded that the Romans revert to the terms of the treaty of Tiberius Gracchus. The officers of Marcus Claudius Marcellus were then heard. It seemed that they were inclined towards peace and the senate thought that the consul was more disposed towards the enemy than the allies.Polybius, The Histories, 35.2, 3.1-2 Appian wrote that the senate was not happy that these people had refused the terms put forward earlier by Nobilitor. However, when he described the campaign by Nobilitor he did not mention him making any terms with the Celtiberians.Appian, Roman History, The foreign Wars, Book 6, The Spanish wars,49 The senate replied that Marcellus would communicate its decision to them. Polybius wrote that the private opinion of the senate was that what the allies said was true and to the advantage of Rome, that the Arevaci had a high opinion of themselves and that Marcellus was afraid of war. It secretly ordered the officers Marcellus had sent to continue to fight. It mistrusted Marcellus and it was minded to send one of the new consuls to replace him. It made preparations for the campaign as if the future of Hispania depended in this, assuming that if the enemy was defeated all the other tribes would submit to Rome, but if the Arevaci brokered a peace they and all other tribes would be encouraged to resist. Quintus Fulvius Nobilitor spread rumours of continuous battles and great Roman losses and about the valour of the Celtiberians, as well as claims that Marcellus was afraid of continuing the war. The young recruits panicked and found excuses to avoid recruitment which could not be verified. Competent officers were not willing to serve. Then, the young Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus spoke in the senate and asked to be allowed to be sent to Hispania as an officer or a junior commander and that he was ready to assume such role. He was willing to do so even though he had been given the safer task of going to Macedon where he had been invited to go to settle disputes there. All were surprised because of his youth and cautious disposition. He became popular and made those who had been avoiding military service feel ashamed. The young men enlisted and the officers volunteered.Polybius, The Histories, 35.3.4-9; 4 Appian wrote that the army to be sent to Hispania was chosen by lot instead of the customary levy. It was the first time this happened. This was because ‚Äòmany had complained that they had been treated unfairly by the consuls in the enrolment, while others had been chosen for easy service‚Äô.Appian, Roman History, The foreign Wars, Book 6, The Spanish wars, 49 In 151 BC the new consul, Lucius Licinius Lucullus, was assigned Hispania. While he was on his way, Marcellus told the Celtiberians about the impending war and returned the hostages. He had a long conversation with the chief of the embassy which had gone to Rome. He sought to persuade the Celtiberians to put matters in his hands because he wanted to bring the war to an end before the arrival of Lucullus. After this 5,000 Arevaci took possession of the city of Nertobriga and Marcellus encamped near Numantia. While he was driving the inhabitants inside the wall, their leader asked for a meeting with Marcellus. He said that the Arevaci, Belli and Titti would put themselves in his hands. He demanded and received hostages and money and let them go free, thereby ending the war before Lucullus could relieve him.Appian, Roman History, The foreign Wars, Book 6, The Spanish wars, 48-50 Lucullus' 'illegal' war on the Vaccaei Appian wrote that Lucius Licinius Lucullus was greedy for fame and money and attacked the Vaccaei because he was ‚Äòin straitened circumstances'. This was despite the fact that the senate had not declared war on them and this tribe had never attacked the Romans. He crossed the River Tagus and encamped near the town of Cauca (Coca). The inhabitants asked him what he had come for and what the reason for war was. He replied that they had mistreated the Carpetani and that he had come to their aid. The Caucaei attacked a party of Roman wood cutters and foragers, killed many of them and pursued the fugitives to their camp. In the ensuing battle, being more like a light infantry, they had the advantage at first. However, when they ran out of darts, they fled and 3,000 of them were killed while they were forcing their way through the city gates. The town elders sought peace. Lucullus demanded hostages, 100 talents of silver and a contingent of cavalry for his army. When these were provided, he also demanded that the town be garrisoned by the Romans. This was also agreed and Lucullus ordered 2,000 picked soldiers to seize the city. Then the rest of the Roman army, which had been ordered to kill all adult males, was let in. Only a few out of 20,000 inhabitants managed to escape. Some of them went to other towns. They burnt what they could not take with them to deprive Lucullus of booty.Appian, Roman History, The foreign Wars, Book 6, The Spanish wars, 51-2 Lucullus marched on the town of Itercatia (location uncertain), where more than 20,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry had taken refuge. He called for peace talks. The inhabitants reproached him for the slaughter of the Caucaei and asked him if he intended to do the same to them. Appian wrote: \\"he, like all guilty souls, being angry with his accusers instead of reproaching himself, laid waste their fields\\". He then began a siege and repeatedly lined up his men for battle to provoke a fight. The enemy did not respond, save for one man who often rode into the gaps between the Roman armies and challenged them to single combat. Nobody accepted and he went back to making insulting gestures. Then the young Scipio Aemilianus accepted and luckily defeated this big man despite the size difference. This lifted the spirit of the Romans. However, the next night an enemy cavalry contingent which had gone out foraging before Lucullus had arrived ran about shouting while those inside the city also shouted. This caused terror in the Roman camp. The soldiers were sick due to lack of sleep and dysentery caused by the local food, to which they were not accustomed. Many died of the latter. When some of the siege works were completed the Romans knocked down a section of the city walls, but the attackers were quickly overpowered. They fled and, not knowing the area, many fell into a reservoir and died. The enemy repaired the wall. As both sides suffered famine, Scipio Aemilianus proposed peace and promised that it would not be violated. The Itercalati trusted him and gave Lucullus 10,000 cloaks, some cattle and fifty hostages as part of the terms.Appian, Roman History, The foreign Wars, Book 6, The Spanish wars, 53-4 Next Lucullus went to Pallantia (Pelencia). This town was hosting a large number of refugees and was renowned for its bravery. He was advised to avoid it, but he heard that it was a rich town. He encamped there and did not leave until constant harassment of the Roman foragers by the Pallantian cavalry prevented him from getting supplies. The Romans withdrew and were pursued by the enemy until they reached the River Durius (Douro). Then they went back home at night. Lucullus went to the territory of the Tudretani and went into winter camps. This was the end of his illegal war against the Vaccaei. He was never called to account for it.Appian, Roman History, The foreign Wars, Book 6, The Spanish wars, 54 Appian commented: \\"As for the gold and silver that Lucullus was after (and for the sake of which he had waged this war, thinking that all of Hispania abounded with gold and silver), he got nothing. Not only did they have none, but these particular [tribes] did not set any value on those metals.Appian, Roman History, The foreign Wars, Book 6, The Spanish wars, 54 In his account of the Lusitanian War, Appian wrote that Lucullus and Servius Sulpicius Galba, a praetor who was in charge of the troops in Hispania Ulterior and was campaigning against a Lusitanian rebellion, conducted a joint pincer operation against Lusitania. According to Appian they gradually depopulated it. Appian described Galba as being even more Greedy than Lucullus. He killed many Lusitanians by treachery.Appian, Roman History, The foreign Wars, Book 6, The Spanish wars, 59 Aftermath In 147 BC, four years after the end of the Second Celtiberian War, the Lusitanians, who had rebelled between 155 BC and 150 BC, rebelled again in the Viriathic War (147‚Äì139 BC). In 144 BC, the fourth year of this war, Viriathus, the Lusitanian leader, incited the Celtiberians to rebel. This led to the Numantine War (143‚Äì133 BC), which was the longest war of resistance against the Romans.

It is one of the more common Saturniids, reaching pest status occasionally in the northern parts of its range. As they are late-season feeders, however, they do little lasting damage to their hosts (most of the energy has been stored already). It is very similar to A. finlaysoni in southern Ontario and A. peigleri in the southern US. The species was first described by James Edward Smith in 1797. Range The species lives in eastern North America, from the edge of the Great Plains to the east coast and from southern Ontario to central Georgia, Alabama and eastern Texas. They are found in northern Florida, but are more common in the north. Life cycle There is only one brood a year. Egg Eggs are laid on the underside of leaves in large clusters. They take one to two weeks to hatch. Cluster of larvae Larva Larvae are gregarious in the early instars and often do not disperse much in the late instars. The fifth instar is black with yellow-orange stripes on its side, and prominent spiny horns on the second segment of the thorax, about 5 cm long. Smaller spikes occur on the remaining segments. They feed on oaks in August and September. Pupa As with most of this subfamily, when the caterpillars are ready to pupate, they burrow underground. Just before that, they may be seen wandering to locate pupation sites. Adult A female adult Anisota senatoria moth, with its distinctive orange-yellow color Adults emerge once a year to mate, in mid-June to mid-July. Mating occurs in the middle of the day, and females lay eggs late in the day. As with all of Saturniidae, the adults do not feed. Their mouthparts have been reduced. Females are stout bodied, yellow orange with a silver-white spot and faint black line across the forewing. There is also a line across the hindwing. Males are much smaller, and red brownish, but also have the white spot and pale lines. Both are speckled with black spots. Wingspan 3‚Äì5 cm. Food plants Oaks, Quercus species, especially red oaks (Tuskes et al. 1996). Wagner (2005) also reports chestnut, birch, hazel, hickory and maple.

It was argued that the discovery of North Sea oil off the coast of Scotland, and the revenue that it created would not benefit Scotland to any significant degree while Scotland remained part of the United Kingdom. The SNP campaigned widely in both the February 1974 UK General Election and subsequent October 1974 UK General Election using this slogan. At the February election the SNP gained seven seats in the House of Commons and 22% of the Scottish vote, rising to eleven seats and 30% of the vote in the October election. The idea behind the slogan has proven to be controversial in discussions surrounding the financial viability of an independent Scottish state and still resonates to this day.Scotland's oil: Does oil in Scotland have a future? Professor Thomas W Walde - Thomas Walde Professor of International Economic Energy and Natural Resources Law at the University of Dundee Background The outcome of the February 1974 General Election saw the Labour Party, led by Harold Wilson, win the most seats. Prime Minister Edward Heath, leader of the Conservative Party, lost support from the Ulster Unionist Party and, although he entered coalition negotiations with Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe, these broke down. The Labour Party then formed the new government, with a plurality of seats but without a majority. In October 1974, Wilson went back to the country to ask for a renewed mandate. During this time, in Scotland support for the Scottish National Party had been increasing after the victory of the SNP candidate Winnie Ewing at the 1967 Hamilton by-election. The political instability surrounding the general elections of 1974 represented a time of intense political campaigning in the UK, which further brought the SNP to prominence. It was during this time that the slogan \\"It's Scotland's Oil\\" came to the fore with the February election seeing 7 SNP candidates returned, rising to 11 in October. Some well known MPs such as Tam Dalyell believe this was in no small part due to the \\"It's Scotland's oil\\" slogan employed by the Scottish National Party.Independent Online edition December 2005 Tam Dalyell, who served as Labour MP in West Lothian for 43 years, agrees.... \\"It could have tipped the balance it a number of seats including mine. Oil was very much a totemic issue\\" The economic background to the claim was the discovery of oil in the North Sea in the 1960s, and its coming on line in the 1970s. The majority of the largest oil fields in the UK sector of the North Sea were found in the waters to the north and east of the Scottish mainland, with the more northerly fields found to the east of the Orkney and Shetland islands.School Science from The Energy Institute Map of North Sea oil fields Aberdeen became the centre of Britain's North Sea oil industry, with many oil terminals such as that of Sullom Voe in Shetland and Flotta in Orkney and at Cruden Bay and St Fergus on the north east coast of Scotland, being built to support the North Sea oil industry. In the early 1970s, there was a great deal of economic turbulence with the 1973 oil price shock caused by the Yom Kippur War, resulting in rising inflation coupled with high unemployment, recession (also known as stagflation) in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom.Scotland on Sunday, January 1, 2006 How North Sea oil calmed the UK's crisis ridden waters Thus the economic argument that formed the basis of the slogan was that while Scotland was part of the United Kingdom, it lacked control over royalties and revenue from the majority of the oil which lay in the Scottish sector of the North Sea. Reality of the claim Given that Scotland is not a sovereign state, it has no effective maritime boundaries; and any claims Scotland may assert are subsumed as part of claims made by the United Kingdom. However, due to the existence of two separate legal systems in Great Britain -- that of Scots law pertaining to Scotland and English law pertaining to England and Wales -- constitutional law in the United Kingdom has provided for the division of the UK sector of the North Sea into specific Scottish and English components.Parliament of the United Kingdom - Standing Committee B, Energy Bill (2004) Lords Hansard discussion on the subject The Continental Shelf Act 1964 and the Continental Shelf (Jurisdiction) Order 1968 defined the UK North Sea maritime area to the north of latitude 55 degrees north as being under the jurisdiction of Scots lawUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea UK Legislation - The Continental Shelf (Jurisdiction) Order 1968 meaning that 90% of the UK's oil resources was considered under Scottish jurisdiction.Murkens, Jones & Keating (2002) p183 In addition, section 126 of the Scotland Act 1998 defined Scottish waters as the internal waters and territorial sea of the United Kingdom as are adjacent to Scotland.Scotland Act 1998 Section 126 - Interpretation This was subsequently amended by the Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundary Order 1999 which redefined the extent of Scottish waters and Scottish fishery limits.Statutory Instrument 1126 of 1999 Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundary Order 1999Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundary Order 1999 Map of the extent of Scottish Waters Recent evidence by Kemp and Stephen (1999) has tried to estimate hypothetical Scottish shares of North Sea Oil revenue by dividing the UK sector of the North Sea into separate Scottish and English sectors using the international principle of equidistance as utilised under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) - such a convention is used in defining the maritime assets of newly formed states and resolving international maritime disputes. The study by Kemp & Stephen showed that hypothesised Scottish shares of North Sea oil revenue over the period 1970 to 1999 varied, dependent upon the price of oil and offset against taxable profits and the costs of exploration and development.Murkens, Jones & Keating (2002) p189 Nevertheless, a Scottish share of North Sea oil is never formally alluded to as part of Scotland's net fiscal position and is treated by HM Treasury as extra-regio resources.Government Expenditure and Revenue (Scotland) 2002-03 In the Regional Accounts, the UK Continental Shelf is included in a separate region of the UK (the Extra-regio territory) and is not allocated to specific geographic regions The BBC economist Evan Davis however reported prior to the 2007 Scottish Parliament election that the Barnett formula already allows Scotland to sustain higher levels of per capita public spending relative to the rest of the UK, which is approximately equivalent to its disproportionately high annual contribution of tax revenues to the central UK Treasury from Oil production. However Scotland's per capita spending growth, relative to the rest of the UK, has in recent years, been nominally reduced by the operation of the Barnett formula, in order to bring public spending levels into line with the UK average, in a phenomenon that had been dubbed the \\"Barnett Squeeze\\". Claims by Shetland and Orkney There have been moves to recast the constitutional status of Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles partly in order to get a greater share of the oil revenues to these islands, in whose maritime territory it is argued that most of the oil is found. Scottish Independence Referendum Jim Sillars, former Deputy Leader of the Scottish National Party, said during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum that ‚ÄúBP, in an independent Scotland, will need to learn the meaning of nationalisation, in part or in whole, as it has in other countries who have not been as soft as we have forced to be. We will be the masters of the oil fields, not BP or any other of the majors.‚Äùhttps://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/day-of-reckoning-post-yes-vote- says-jim- sillars-1-3539754https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/09/12/scottish- independence-jim-sillars-nationalise_n_5810496.html Notes and references *Murkens, J, Jones, P & Keating, M (2002) Scottish independence - A Practical Guide.

Broadcasting for 43 hours each week, Newsroom features live and taped news reports, in addition to analysis from experts on the issues being covered, and headlines throughout each hour. The program tends to focus on softer news than their hard news politics-based primetime lineup. The program is the standard \\"brand\\" for general rolling-news programming for the network, originating from their headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. It debuted on September 4, 2006 replacing CNN Live Today, Live From, CNN Saturday, CNN Saturday Night, CNN Sunday, and CNN Sunday Night.  History  CNN Newsroom features various anchors on weekdays and weekends. Since the start of September 8, 2008, the program has employed a single-presenter format. The program shares the same name of an earlier CNN program, debuted in 1989, that was shown commercial-free by teachers in schools. On June 18, 2012, CNN introduced Newsroom International presented by Suzanne Malveaux. This hour-long block of news focuses on news across the globe. The show is based in CNN's World Headquarters in Atlanta. On February 25, 2013, Newsroom International was changed to Around the World, but was cancelled on February 7, 2014. Weekend mornings, which formerly aired under the Newsroom banner before being relaunched as weekend editions of New Day in June 2013, are anchored by Victor Blackwell and Christi Paul. Fredricka Whitfield hosts the weekend daytime edition of Newsroom. The weekend afternoon/evening edition was originally hosted by Don Lemon (later Poppy Harlow and Ana Cabrera). On August 12, 2013, CNN rebranded the a portion of the broadcast of Newsroom as Legal View with Ashleigh Banfield. The 60-minute- long show based in New York focused on the most important legal news of the day, and aired its last episode on September 23, 2016. From August 12, 2013 to February 7, 2014, Newsroom, with its reduced airtime, aired weekday mornings for two hours anchored by Carol Costello. Wolf Blitzer anchored the a later hour of the program with Brooke Baldwin until February 2014, when the slot was renamed as Wolf. The new show details the latest on politics, breaking news and international news, and was simulcast on CNN International. Wolf was cancelled on November 9, 2018. On February 10, 2014, an hour of CNN Newsroom was renamed @THIS HOUR with Berman and Michaela hosted by John Berman and Michaela Pereira. In November 2014, Poppy Harlow took over primetime anchoring duties on weekend evening editions of CNN Newsroom. The shift was covered by rotating anchors following Don Lemon's move to CNN Tonight in early 2014. In February 2017, Carol Costello left CNN for HLN, and was succeeded by John Berman and Poppy Harlow. Ana Cabrera took over Harlow's weekend evening slot. In May 2018, John Berman left the show to become the new co-anchor of New Day, the flagship morning program for CNN. In September 2018, Jim Sciutto became the new co-anchor in CNN Newsroom on the show with Poppy Harlow. On March 26, 2020, CNN Newsroom gained the duration up to 6 hours, dropping other shows that aired from 11am to 2pm ET. With this new change, Poppy Harlow & Jim Scuitto remains on the 9-11am slot, then John King anchors until 1pm, and the show concludes with Brianna Keilar's shift that lasts until 3pm ET.

Westlake, and who is the protagonist of 14 novels and 11 short stories published between 1970 and 2009. He first appeared in the novel The Hot Rock, published in 1970. Westlake originally intended The Hot Rock to feature his character Parker and to publish it under his Richard Stark pseudonym. However, the plot involves a precious gem that is stolen, lost, reacquired, stolen again, lost again (and so forth), which seemed too comic a situation for a hard-boiled creation like Parker. Westlake therefore rewrote the novel with a more bumbling and likable cast of characters, led by a pessimistic, hard-luck professional thief. A neon sign Westlake spotted for DAB beer, spelled the acronym out to be \\"Dortmunder Actien Brauerei\\", which provided the name for the book's new protagonist. Dortmunder is similar to Parker in several ways. He is a career criminal and a \\"planner,\\" creating schemes for burglaries and assigning responsibilities to his team. Dortmunder is tall with stooped shoulders and \\"lifeless thinning hair-colored hair\\" and has a disreputable \\"hangdog\\" face which rarely smiles. He shares an apartment with longtime girlfriend May Bellamy, a supermarket cashier, in Manhattan on East 19th Street. Unlike Parker, however, Dortmunder is a nonviolent character who devises schemes that start out fairly straight-forward but usually turn out outlandish and over-the-top. Character background Very little is known of Dortmunder's childhood. It is mentioned in more than one book that he was abandoned at birth and raised in an orphanage in the fictional town of Dead Indian, Illinois, run by the Bleeding Heart Sisters of Eternal Misery. Dortmunder married a nightclub entertainer whose stage name was 'Honeybun Bazoom' shortly before he left the country to serve in Korea in 1952. The marriage took place in San Diego; upon his return from Korea, they were divorced in Reno in 1954. Dortmunder has been twice convicted of burglary charges, serving time in prison ‚Äì he is completing the final day of his second prison term at the very beginning of The Hot Rock. Always hanging over Dortmunder's head is the knowledge that a third conviction will mean that he will be sent to prison for the rest of his life with no chance of parole. The fact that something almost always goes wrong with Dortmunder's jobs, in spite of careful planning, has given him the reputation of being jinxed ‚Äî and despite claiming not to be superstitious, Dortmunder has believed so, too. In fact, Dortmunder gets worried when things go smoothly and seems relieved when something does go wrong. In most novels, Dortmunder's team earn only small amounts of money; the resultant heists, therefore, are only Pyrrhic victories, and the moral for the reader is that Crime Does Not Pay ... at least not very well. However, Dortmunder is not always unlucky, and in some novels and stories he and his crew make out quite well. Dortmunder has occasionally used the alias \\"John Diddums\\" and tells anyone who asks that it's Welsh (to which they usually reply \\"Ah\\" or \\"Oh\\"); he came up with the name on the spur of the moment in the short story \\"Too Many Crooks\\" (1989) and dislikes it, but now uses it involuntarily in circumstances that preclude using his real name. The motto of his family crest (which he admits he stole) is \\"Quid lucrum istic mihi est?\\" (\\"What's in it for me?\\"). A firm believer that \\"if you couldn't accomplish a task with five men, you shouldn't try it at all\\" (What's The Worst That Could Happen?), Dortmunder as a rule never works with more than four other people. However, in What's The Worst That Could Happen?, a job in Las Vegas (robbing a Las Vegas Strip hotel/casino) is so irresistible to other associates that he winds up with a total \\"crew\\" of twenty people. As is common with characters in long-running series, Dortmunder and his companions seem to be more-or-less frozen at the age they were when we first met them. His age is given as 37 in 1970's The Hot Rock, and as 40 in 1977's Nobody's Perfect; thereafter, Dortmunder would appear to be somewhere in his early forties throughout the series' nearly forty-year run.  Associates  Except in a few short stories, where Dortmunder is working alone, each of Dortmunder's plans calls for a \\"string\\" (or team). Seen most frequently are: *Andy Kelp: All- purpose crook Andy Kelp is Dortmunder's best friend, though Dortmunder would be the first to deny this. Cheerful and optimistic where Dortmunder is dour and relentlessly pessimistic, Kelp is boundlessly enthusiastic and full of (sometimes questionable) ideas. In appearance, he is shorter than Dortmunder, has a pointy nose, has birdlike mannerisms, and looks \\"like a cockney pickpocket\\" (Nobody's Perfect). An experienced thief, Kelp has a notable penchant for stealing cars with M.D. plates whenever he needs transportation, his reasoning being that doctors have both the money and the ego to provide themselves with the very best, and they often leave the keys in their cars. Kelp also loves to adopt the newest electronic gadgets, generally to Dortmunder's annoyance. Because Kelp has brought Dortmunder many eventually unsuccessful jobs (or jobs that promised great payment but which dismally disappoint all members of the \\"string\\"), Dortmunder has been known to call Kelp a jinx. However, Dortmunder is generally loyal to Kelp throughout the series, even if he sometimes finds him exasperating (especially as Kelp has developed the habit of picking the lock on John's apartment door and entering without knocking or ringing the doorbell first). Kelp has an older sister, whose adult son Victor (a former FBI agent who wanted the FBI to have a secret handshake) plays a role in some of the gang's misadventures (Bank Shot and Nobody's Perfect). Although unmarried over the course of the series, Kelp is known to have had at least two prior marriages, presumably dissolved. *Stan Murch: Stocky, red-headed Stan Murch is the gang's usual driver. Genial and uncomplicated, Murch lives in Canarsie with his cab-driver mother (usually referred to as \\"Murch's Mom\\" [see below]). Murch's life revolves around cars; he listens to audio recordings of the Indianapolis 500 for relaxation, and virtually every conversation he has will include a detailed account of his most recent trip in his car. Kelp and Murch are the only regulars to appear in every novel. Kelp also appears in many of the short stories. Over the course of the series, several other regulars were gradually added to the mix, including: *Tchotchkus \\"Tiny\\" Bulcher: Introduced in Nobody's Perfect. A specialist in Thuggery, Tiny is a massive, muscular \\"man mountain\\" of Eastern European ancestry; one of the more interesting descriptions of him is \\"a medium range intercontinental ballistic missile with legs. Also arms, about the shape of fire hydrants but longer, and a head, about the shape of a fire hydrant.\\" (What's The Worst That Could Happen?). He is used to getting exactly what he wants, and due to his size and physical strength (he has been known to steal cars by merely lifting them onto a flatbed truck), he doesn't have to ask for it twice. He often tells stories about past crimes that have sometimes gone wrong and the dire consequences he has administered to his cronies if they were to blame for the failed scheme. He generally finds Dortmunder and his cronies amusing ‚Äì much to their relief. *Rollo: The bartender at the O.J. Bar and Grill on Amsterdam Avenue, the favorite hangout and meeting place for Dortmunder and his people. He remembers all of his customers by their drinking preferences, even when the customer hasn't set foot inside the bar for years, and usually refers to his customers by their drinks. He willingly turns a blind eye to what goes on in the bar's back room, but makes sure that there's no trouble in the main room. He runs the bar for the real owner, who's retired to Florida, and keeps him informed of how things are going. *Arnie Albright: Dortmunder's usual fence. Arnie lives alone in a squalid apartment on the Upper West Side and collects calendars. Through his appearance and behavior, Arnie repulses every character he encounters, but he is fully aware of this and compensates by offering better terms than his competitors. Even Dortmunder can't always stand dealing with Arnie and from time to time deals instead with another fence named Stoon. *Judson \\"The Kid\\" Blint: Introduced in Watch Your Back. A graduate of both high school and J. C. Taylor's (see below) detective course, Judson arrived unannounced at her offices looking for a job. J. C. immediately saw through him and his fake r√©sum√©, but sensed his potential and hired him as her assistant to take over the day-to-day running of her mail- order scams. He originally joined Dortmunder's gang as something of a mascot/prot√©g√©, but by the time of Get Real has been accepted as one of them (even if he hasn't yet settled on what he drinks at the OJ). *Max: Proprietor of Maximillian's Used Cars. Max is a stereotypically dishonest used car dealer who is perennially unhappy with the state of his business. When Stan Murch (or others in the gang) wants to dispose of vehicles they have stolen in exchange for some quick cash, Max is usually the buyer. Several other specialists appear less frequently in the series, such as Ralph Winslow (a lockman), Wally Whistler (an extremely absentminded lockman who once accidentally released a lion from its cage at the zoo), Jim O'Hara (a recently released burglar who still hasn't lost his prison pallor) and Herman Jones (a black lockman formerly known as \\"Herman X\\" when he was a black radical and \\"Herman Makanene Stulu'mbnick\\" when he was briefly Vice-President of the [fictional] African nation of Talabwo). Other memorable associates/appearances include Wilbur Howey (a lockman recently released after a forty-eight year sentence [originally ten years, but he kept escaping and getting immediately caught]), Roger Chefwick (a lockman who's crazy about model trains) and Fred and Thelma Lartz (a husband-wife driving team, but Thelma now does the actual driving because Fred has lost his nerve after nearly being run down by an Eastern Airlines flight on a Kennedy Airport runway). Also of note are the various wives, girlfriends and female family members of the regulars, who often find their way into the plots. These regulars are sometimes employed directly in the gang's criminal enterprises, other times they are not. But they are all seen frequently, and could certainly be accused of aiding and abetting Dortmunder and his cronies in all their endeavors: *May Bellamy: Dortmunder's long-standing live-in girlfriend, introduced in Bank Shot (the second novel). She is a supermarket cashier (initially at Bohack's, in later books at Safeway); they met when she caught Dortmunder shoplifting. She's thin, dark- haired, a chain-smoker (although she gives this up in later novels, resorting to fake-smoking), and usually more optimistic than Dortmunder (which isn't hard). She also can successfully keep him from becoming discouraged. During lean times, she keeps the two of in them in groceries that she steals from whichever store she's working in at the moment. *Josephine Carol \\"J.C.\\" Taylor: Introduced in Good Behavior. Known as \\"J.C.\\", she is a sexy, tough businesswoman who runs several shady mail order enterprises, including a detective course, a song poem service, and her best-selling product by far: a profusely illustrated 'educational' sex manual in which Josie herself is the primary female model. Beginning in Watch Your Back, she delegates the day-to- day operations of these scams to Judson Blint in order to focus her attention on Maylohda (\\"mail order\\" in a New York pronunciation), a nonexistent country she created (and acts as Commercial Attach√© for) in order to receive economic development aid. She is Tiny's girlfriend, but only Tiny calls her \\"Josie\\". *Anne Marie Carpinaw: Introduced in What's The Worst That Could Happen?. A congressman's daughter from the midwest, abandoned in New York City by her husband, she became Andy Kelp's girlfriend after meeting him in a hotel bar and then becoming involved with him in the course of Dortmunder's vengeful pursuit of Max Fairbanks. She has since moved in with Andy and has accepted his unusual lifestyle. *Gladys Murch: Almost always referred to as \\"Murch's Mom\\", a temperamental cabdriver, usually out for a quick buck. Her first name is revealed in Drowned Hopes. When planning their heists, the group usually meets in the back room of the O.J. Bar and Grill (whoever gets there first gets the chair at the circular table facing the door; Tiny is the only one who doesn't mind sitting with his back to the door). At these meetings, Andy and Dortmunder drink Amsterdam Liquor Store Bourbon (labeled \\"Our Own Brand\\") over ice, Murch drinks beer and salt (due to his status as a driver, he prefers to nurse one beer, and the salt restores the head on it), Ralph Winslow drinks rye and water with many ice-cubes which he keeps clinking, and Tiny drinks a tincture of red wine and vodka (described as looking like \\"flat cherry soda\\"). Scenes set in the public areas of the O.J. usually involve the unnamed \\"regulars\\" at the bar, who provide comic relief by engaging in heated arguments on various topics of which they are ignorant.  Significant items stolen by Dortmunder  *The Balabomo Emerald (The Hot Rock) *The Capitalists' & Immigrants' Trust Bank (Bank Shot) *The Byzantine Fire (a ruby) (Why Me?) *The Femur of St. Ferghana (Don't Ask) *The body of a 70-years-dead Native American (Bad News) *Strands of Viveca Quinlan's hair (Bad News) *A gold chess set originally intended as a gift for Czar Nicholas II (What's So Funny?) *A bronze casting of a Rodin statue (short story 'Ask A Silly Question')  Successful robberies committed by Dortmunder and his crew  *various valuable objects (including jewelry, rare coins/stamps and jade) from Avalon State Bank Tower (Good Behavior) *various valuable objects (including silver and a Lexus sedan) from Max Fairbank's Carrport house (What's The Worst That Could Happen?) *various valuable objects (including artwork and jewelry) from Max Fairbank's New York City apartment (What's The Worst That Could Happen?) *$50,000 in illegal Political Action Committee money at the Watergate Hotel, Washington, D.C.

It was written by Carlos Castaneda and submitted as his Master's thesis in the school of Anthropology. It purports to document the events that took place during an apprenticeship with a self-proclaimed Yaqui Indian Sorcerer, don Juan Matus from Sonora, Mexico between 1960 and 1965. The book is divided into two sections. The first section, The Teachings, is a first-person narrative that documents Castaneda's initial interactions with don Juan. He speaks of his encounters with Mescalito (a teaching spirit inhabiting all peyote plants), divination with lizards and flying using the \\"yerba del diablo\\" (lit. \\"Devil's Weed\\"; Jimson weed), and turning into a blackbird using \\"humito\\" (lit. \\"little smoke\\"; a smoked powder containing Psilocybe mexicana). The second, A Structural Analysis, is an attempt, Castaneda says, at \\"disclos[ing] the internal cohesion and the cogency of don Juan‚Äôs Teachings.\\"Castaneda, Carlos. The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge. Berkeley: U of California P, 1998: 155.

He writes of a general discouragement from the project by his professors (besides Clement Woodward Meighan, a professor who supported the project early in its conception. In the foreword, Castaneda gives \\"full credit\\" for the approval of his dissertation to Meighan). He offers a new thesis on a mind-state he calls \\"total freedom\\" and claims that he used the teachings of his Yaqui shaman as \\"springboards into new horizons of cognition\\".Castaneda, Carlos.

It was his most popular play. First staged on November 26, 1715, in Osaka, it ran for the next 17 months, far longer than the usual few weeks or months. Its enduring popularity can largely be attributed to its effectiveness as entertainment. Its many scenes over more than seven years follow the adventures of Coxinga (based on the adventures of the historical figure Koxinga; as the play is loosely based on history, it is a jidaimono play, not a domestic play) in restoring the rightful dynasty of China. It features effects uniquely suited for the puppet theater, such as the villain Ri T≈çten gouging out an eye (ostensibly to prove his loyalty). Donald Keene suggests that the adventures in exotic China played well in isolationist Tokugawa Japan. While generally not considered as great in literary quality as some of Chikamatsu's domestic tragedies like The Love Suicides at Amijima, it is generally agreed to be his best historical play. Plot Act 1 =Scene 1= The plot begins in the exceedingly luxurious and profligate court of the Chinese Emperor Shis≈çretsu (ÊÄùÂÆãÁÉà; actually Chongzhen Emperor of the Ming dynasty), in May 1644. His wife is ready to give birth to their first son and future heir; Ry≈´kakun (Êü≥Ê≠åÂêõ), wife of the loyal and sagacious counselor Go Sankei (Wu Sangui), has just given birth so she can be the imperial heir's wet nurse. The Great King of Tartary (the Manchus) sends Prince Bairoku (Ê¢ÖÂãí Áéã) as his emissary to the court. The emissary's demand is that the emperor's wife be sent to him, to become his consort. The minister and General of the Right, Ri T≈çten (ÊùéËπàÂ§©) reveals that the reason that the Great King believes he can make this demand is because, in 1641, Ri T≈çten had sought ten million bushels of grain to relieve the famine gripping the land. In exchange, Ri T≈çten had given them his promise that later they could ask for anything they wished. Go Sankei opposes making good on Ri T≈çten's promise, pointing out to him the immorality and outright foolishness of sending away the Empress with the heir. The envoy is deeply offended and rises to leave, uttering promises of war, when Ri T≈çten takes his dagger and gouges out his left eye and presents it to the prince, who is thereby mollified when he leaves. =Scene 2= The Emperor, favorably impressed by Ri T≈çten's sacrifice decides to marry his younger sister, the lovely Princess Sendan (Ê†¥Ê™ÄÁöáÂ•≥) to him. She is opposed to any marriage so the Emperor forces her to wager her assent on the outcome of a mock battle between 200 court ladies wielding plum or cherry branches. At the Emperor's previous instruction, the plums lose, dooming Sendan to the marriage. Alarmed by the commotion of battle, Go Sankei apparels for war and rushes in. When he discovers the \\"senselessness\\" of the mock battle, he reproaches the emperor at length for alarming the palace; for setting a bad example; for his extravagances; his dislike of governance; and for being such a careless ruler that he didn't know that Ri T≈çten was responsible for the famine by stealing rice from the Imperial storehouses and using his ill-got proceeds to bribe and corrupt people throughout the country; and last (but not least) for not recognizing that Ri T≈çten gouging out his eye was a message to the Tartars that they had his complete backing and should invade. (Go Sankei \\"proves\\" this through use of yin and yang and analysis of ideographs.) The Emperor scorns Go Sankei's lecture but immediately an ancient plaque with the dynasty name on it shatters. With a great tumult, the former envoy breaks into the palace at the head of an irresistible enemy host. Go Sankei's forces are hopelessly outnumbered and cannot resist. He instructs Ry≈´kakun to take the Princess to a certain harbor, named Kaid≈ç (Êµ∑Áôª). Go Sankei and his men cut a path through the opposing hordes and secure the escape of the Empress and Emperor, Before Go Sankei's forces succeed and he returns, Ri T≈çten and his brother, Ri Kaih≈ç (ÊùéÊµ∑Êñπ), seize the Emperor and cut off his head. T≈çten takes the head to the Great King. Ri Kaih≈ç is left to bring the Empress along into custody. On Go Sankei's return, he wrathfully strikes down Ri Kaih≈ç and sorrowfully removes the imperial appurtenances and imperial regalia from the imperial corpse. With his own son and the Empress, the three escape to the coast at Kaid≈ç. =Scene 3= Unfortunately for the three fugitives, no ships can be found at Kaid≈ç to take them across to safety. They are pursued by musketeers who kill the Empress. Pausing in his haste, Go Sankei realizes that the rightful heir to the throne may yet be salvaged. With his sword, he performs a Caesarean section and removes the still living prince. However, fearing that the enemy forces would realize that the prince lived when they saw the empty womb, Go Sankei kills his infant son and places the corpse in the womb to gain time and fool the enemy. Go Sankei does not meet up with Ry≈´kakun and the princess. Ry≈´kakun ambushes one of Ri Toten's henchmen, seizing his boat and sword. She puts the princess in the boat, pushes it off, trusting in the elements to deliver the princess to an old loyal courtier exiled to Japan, \\"Ikkan\\" or \\"Tei Shiry≈´ R≈çikkan\\" (ÈÑ≠ËäùÈæçËÄÅ‰∏ÄÂÆò; Zheng Zhilong, also known as Iquan). Ry≈´kakun remains on the shore and perishes fighting the Tartars; they leave satisfied that everyone (including the prince) is dead, except for Go Sankei ‚Äî although he does not worry them. Act 2 =Scene 1= Act 2 dawns in a sleepy Japanese fishing village, to which the \\"Grand Tutor\\" Tei Shiry≈´ fled after being banished from China so many years ago. There he remarried and had a son, Wat≈çnai (ÂíåËó§ÂÜÖ), whom he raised as a fisherman and who has married a sturdy fisherwoman. He ceaselessly studied all the texts his father brought with him from China, studying with especial ardour the works on military strategy and tactics, and histories of war. Despite his earnest efforts, he never truly grasps military matters until one day walking on the beach he espies a clam and a shrike locked in combat. The shrike's beak has been trapped and it cannot escape; at the same time the clam is vulnerable as it is only safe so long as it holds on. The lesson Wat≈çnai draws from this is \\"to provoke a quarrel between two adversaries, and then catch both when they least expect it.\\" Wat≈çnai immediately decides to try to apply his newfound insight to the war between China and Tartary. No sooner has Wat≈çnai's wife Komutsu (Â∞è„ÇÄ„Å§) pried apart the shrike and clam than the two see a small boat drifting towards them. Inside is the Princess Sendan. Neither Wat≈çnai nor Komutsu speak Chinese. Perplexed what to do, they summon Tei Shiry≈´, who relates to Sendan his exile. Sendan then pours forth her recent history. Encouraged by a prophecy of victory mentioned by Tei Shiry≈´'s unnamed Japanese wife and by analysis of ideograms and the I Ching, Wat≈çnai resolves to reconquer China for the emperor. Wat≈çnai tries to leave without his Komutsu but, shamed by this, she tries to persuade Wat≈çnai to beat her to death first with his oar. Wat≈çnai refuses. He relents when she is about to hurl herself off the cliff; apparently he had only been testing her to see whether he could entrust the princess to her. She passes, and Wat≈çnai, Tei Shiry≈´, and his wife set off for China. =Scene 2= In China, Tei Shiry≈´ has a plan of sorts. In his exile, he left behind one daughter named Kinsh≈çjo (Èå¶Á••Â•≥), who has married a puissant lord and general named Goj≈çgun Kanki (ÁîòËºù). With her aid, hopefully Kanki could be persuaded to rebel and join forces with them and Go Sankei against their foreign overlords. They decide to split up and take separate routes to avoid suspicion. While passing through the \\"Bamboo Forest of a Thousand Leagues\\" (ÂçÉÈáå„Ç±Á´π), Wat≈çnai and his mother encounter a large and fierce tiger driven there by a tiger hunt. Wat≈çnai defeats the tiger and receives its submission. An Taijin (ÂÆâÂ§ß‰∫∫), underling of Ri Toten, rushes up with his officers and soldiers ‚Äì they had driven the tiger thence, intending to take its head as a present for the Great King. Wat≈çnai refuses to give over the tiger and speaks rudely to them. They attack, but the tiger intervenes, splintering and shattering all their weaponry. Wat≈çnai seizes An Taijin and hurls him against a rock. His body is shattered and he dies. Threatened, the officers and soldiers avow that they were not particularly enthused by Tartary and its regime, and so would join Wat≈çnai. He gives them all Japanese-style shaved heads and new names like \\"Luzonbei\\" or \\"Siamtar≈ç\\" or \\"Jakartabei\\" or even \\"Englandbei\\". Act 3 =Scene 1= At the impregnable Castle of Lions (ÁçÖÂ≠êÂüé), Wat≈çnai is in favor of attacking at once with his newfound soldiers, arguing that his half- sister's failure to ever send a letter to Tei Shiry≈´ amply proves her disloyalty. His mother dissuades him, pointing out that a wife must obey her husband. Tei Shiry≈´ asks at the gate to be allowed entrance and a private audience with General Kanki. Kanki is not there at that moment, so Tei Shiry≈´ asks to speak to Kanki's wife and mentions that he is recently arrived from Japan. Agitated by his request and foreignness, the guards begin threatening them and preparing for battle; the narrator suggests that Kinsh≈çjo rushes to the gate because she hears the rising tumult the guards make. She instructs the guards to \\"do nothing rash!\\" She then inquires into the identities of the visitors. Tei Shiry≈´ reveals himself. Kinsh≈çjo allows that Tei Shiry≈´'s story of himself is accurate, but she demands proof. He replies that his face should be compared to a portrait he had made of himself and left with her many years ago. This proof conclusively settles the matter, as the image matches and none by Kinsh≈çjo and Tei Shiry≈´ would remember the portrait now as well. Kinsh≈çjo would let them all in, but the Great King of Tartary has issued orders that no foreigners be allowed into any fortresses. Kinsh≈çjo asks the soldiers to make an exception for her stepmother. They agree only on the condition that she be fettered like a criminal (so if anyone should take them to task for breaking their orders, they would have an excuse). Before she vanishes into the gate, an agreement is made with Tei Shiry≈´ and Wat≈çnai waiting outside: If the negotiations go well, white dye will be dumped into the cistern, which will shortly flow into the river outside and be very visible. If the negotiations fail, the dye will be red. =Scene 2= Kawarazaki Gonj≈´r≈ç I as Wat≈çnai (right) and Sawamura Tanosuke III as Kinsh≈çjo (left) Kawarazaki Gonj≈´r≈ç I as Wat≈çnai (left) While Kinsh≈çjo's maids are occupied trying to find some acceptable fare for the mother to eat, Kanki returns with good news: He has been promoted by the Great King to general of cavalry, commanding 100,000 horsemen. The mother comes in, and Kanki is moved by her hindrances and the love of her stepdaughter that prompted her to travel over the dangerous oceans. She asks him to throw in his lot with Wat≈çnai. His response is favorable, but he demurs from giving an immediate answer: He wants some time to consider. The mother presses him for the answer. Forced, he says yes, and then attempts to kill Kinsh≈çjo. The mother intervenes and berates Kanki for trying to kill her daughter. Kanki explains that if he didn't kill Kinsh≈çjo before announcing the alliance, he would be shamed before the whole world by gossip claiming that he did not join Wat≈çnai's rebellion out of principle but because he was wholly dominated by his wife and her relations. Kinsh≈çjo accepts Kanki's reasoning and steps forth to his sword. Once again, though cruelly bound, the mother intervenes. She reasons that if she allows her stepdaughter to be killed in front of her the very first time the two met, then \\"people will say that your Japanese stepmother hated her Chinese stepdaughter so much ‚Äì though they were separated by three thousand leagues ‚Äì that she had her put to death before her eyes. Such a report would disgrace not only me but Japan, for people would say, judging the country by my acts, that the Japanese were cruel-hearted.\\" Kinsh≈çjo is convinced by the mother's speech this time and is reduced to tears. Seeing this, Kanki realizes that he cannot join Wat≈çnai and is now his reluctant enemy. Kinsh≈çjo goes to her bedchamber to deliver the scarlet dye signal. Wat≈çnai bursts in among them regardless of the guards, and comes to loggerheads with Kanki when Kinsh≈çjo comes back in: the scarlet came from no dye but the blood of her fatally cut open belly. Both Kanki and Wat≈çnai are stunned, but now that Kinsh≈çjo is dying and soon to be dead, Kanki can again join forces with Wat≈çnai. Kanki bestows on Wat≈çnai the new name that he will make famous: Coxinga. Coxinga's mother perceives all this with joy, and true to her earlier words about shame, stabs herself in the throat and cuts through her liver. With her dying words, she exhorts Coxinga to defeat the hordes of Tartary mercilessly and to filially obey Tei Shiry≈´. She and Kinsh≈çjo expire together. Coxinga sets out with a will and an army. Act 4 =Scene 1= Back in Japan, Komutsu learns of Coxinga's success in obtaining Kanki as an ally. Joyously, she goes to the Shrine of Sumiyoshi, god of the sea, in Matsura. She prays and begins practicing her swordsmanship with a bokken. Some of her prayers are granted: Her skills have progressed to the point where she can cut off a tree branch at a stroke. Encouraged, she proposes to Princess Sendan that they take passage in a merchantman bound for China. The Princess agrees. =Scene 2= Sendan and Komutsu, at the harbor, ask a young fisher boy wearing an uncannily antique hairstyle to take them part of the way in his fishing boat. He promptly complies and, while speaking to them of geography and islands, poles them all the way to China using his supernatural powers. In a twinkling they are there and the boy explains to them that he is really the \\"Boy of the Sea from Sumiyoshi\\". =Scene 3= In this scene, focus shifts to Go Sankei, unseen for so long. For the past two years he had wandered the wilderness and remote regions of China as a fugitive, avoiding the agents of Ri Toten and raising the infant prince; he has grown inured to hardship and is weary. We see him climbing the \\"Mountain of the Nine Immortals\\" (‰πù‰ªôÂ±±), to its summit, prince in arms. Pausing, he sees \\"two old men with shaggy eyebrows and white hair, seemingly in perfect harmony with the pine breeze, as friends who have lived together for years.\\" The two are deeply engrossed in a game of Go. Go Sankei asks the two how they could be so deeply engrossed without the comforts of music, poetry, and wine? They reply that to Go Sankei the game is but a game, however they could see it for what it was: the world itself, yin and yang opposed, with the 361 sections roughly corresponding (to the 360 days of the lunar calendar) to a single day, and the tactics and strategies of the game the same as for war. Through the game, Go Sankei stands spellbound, watching as Coxinga wages his war. Thrilled at Coxinga's successes, Go Sankei makes as if to go to him. The two old men reveal that what he saw so vividly and as so close as the board itself were really hundreds of leagues away and that more than five years have passed since he began watching their game. The two reveal themselves as the founder of the Ming dynasty and his chief counselor, Liu Bowen. The two vanish and Go Sankei discovers that he has grown a long beard and that the prince is now a seven-year-old of grave voice and mien. He asks leave of the prince to inform Coxinga of the prince's location. But the prince has no chance to reply because Tei Shiry≈´ happens on them with the Princess Sendan in tow. They exchange news and discover that the villainous former envoy, Prince Bairoku and his thousands of men are swarming up the mountainside after them. They beseech the first Emperor of the Ming and Liu Bowen to aid them. In response, a bridge of clouds to the other side of the valley forms; they escape on it. When Prince Bairoku and his men try to follow, the bridge is blown away by a wind, and he and his men fall to their deaths. The survivors are pelted with rocks and other missiles until they succumb and Prince Bairoku, having managed to climb out of the chasm, has his head bashed in by Go Sankei with the two immortals' go board. The group then goes to the Castle of Foochow, controlled by Coxinga. Act 5 =Scene 1= Coxinga's forces are drawn up and arrayed before Nanjing ‚Äì the final battle is near. Coxinga discusses with his war council of Kanki, Go Sankei and Tei Shiry≈´ how to defeat the Great King, Ri Toten, and their forces. Go Sankei advocates an ingenious stratagem: tubes stuffed with honey and hornets should be prepared, and when Coxinga's forces prepared to retreat, dropped for the Tartar hordes to greedily open; whereupon they would be stung unmercifully and disarrayed. This opening would then become the focus of their true assault. Should they catch on and attempt to burn the tubes en masse, the gunpowder placed in the bottom of the tubes against just such an occasion would explode them to bits. Kanki proposes that several thousands of baskets of choice provisions be thoroughly poisoned and left behind in another feigned retreat, whereupon they would counterattack. Coxinga likes both suggestions but decides to simply engage in a straightforward frontal assault, with Komutsu and her Japanese-looking troops in the vanguard. The Princess Sendan rushes in with a message from Tei Shiry≈´: He has decided on an honorable suicide by attacking Nanking alone. Coxinga orders the assault launched immediately. =Scene 2= Tei Shiry≈´ arrives at Nanking's main gate and issues his challenge to Ri Toten. The first soldier to respond is easily killed by him. Seeing that Tei Shiry≈´, Coxinga's father, is come, the Great King orders his capture. Tei Shiry≈´ is surrounded by more than 50 club wielding men and is beaten, captured, bound. Shortly thereafter, Coxinga's assault begins. Unarmed, he defeats all comers until Ri Toten and the Great King of Tartary ride up; bound to the face of Ri Toten's shield is Tei Shiry≈´. Coxinga cannot bring himself to attack now that Tei Shiry≈´ is a hostage. Into this dilemma rush Go Sankei and Kanki. They prostrate themselves, and get close to the Great King, pretending to try to exchange Coxinga's head for their lives. The King is pleased by their offer but not so pleased when they spring up and seize him. Even as they do so, Coxinga pulls Tei Shiry≈´ off the shield and binds Ri Toten to it. The King is let off with only 500 lashes, but Ri Toten has his head and both arms cut off by Coxinga, Go Sankei, and Kanki, respectively. The Emperor Eiryaku (Yongli Emperor) is placed on the throne, and all ends well.

Their origins go back to the ecclesiastical reorganisation carried out under Archbishop Theodore of Canterbury (668‚Äì90) and the establishment of a separate northern province in 733. Until 1225 the synods were composed entirely of bishops, but during the thirteenth century more and more clergy were cited until by 1283 the membership was established as the bishops, deans, archdeacons and abbots of each province together with one proctor (representative) from each cathedral chapter and two proctors elected by the clergy of each diocese. The main purpose of the convocations was to take counsel for the well-being of the church and to approve canonical legislation, but in practice much time was spent in discussing the amount of tax to be paid to the Crown since the clergy were a separate estate of the realm and refused to be taxed in or through Parliament. Before the end of the nineteenth century, the Convocation of Canterbury, which was numerically very much larger, played the major role and the activity of the Convocation of York was often little more than giving formal approval to the decisions taken by the southern province. In 1534 the convocations were subjected to the control of the Crown since they were a focus of resistance to Henry VIII's policies at the time of the Reformation and they continued to function in a restricted way under the supervision of the Crown. In 1603/4 they approved the updating and consolidation into one text of much of the Canon law of the Church of England and in 1661 after the restoration of Charles II they approved the text of the revised Book of Common Prayer before it was submitted to Parliament. Four years later, Archbishop Sheldon agreed to surrender the right of the clergy to tax themselves and as a result the convocations ceased to be licensed for business on a regular basis. Between 1688 and 1717 political tensions ran high between the lower houses which was predominately high church in theology and often Jacobite politically and the bishops who were mainly Whigs and latitudinarians and after 1717 their meetings were limited to the formal sessions required at the beginning of a new parliament. Pressure for the reactivation of the convocations began to mount in the 1840s as people began to realise that the Church of England and the state were no longer coterminous and that the Church of England needed to find some means of expressing its mind and will; Henry Phillpotts, Bishop of Exeter, was a leading figure in pressing for their revival. In 1852 the Lower House of Canterbury acted on its own initiative and held a proper debate and from then on, despite strong opposition, many doubts and much debate, both houses of Canterbury gradually increased the range of their activities.Speech by Lord Redesdale, 16 July 1858 (Lords Hansard vol.151 col.1551) York followed suit in 1861 after the death of Archbishop Musgrave. In 1919 the two convocations approved a constitution for the proposed National Assembly of the Church of England in which the laity of each province would have full participation along with the four houses of the convocations themselves. They also petitioned Parliament that the new assembly might have the right to transmit legal measures to Parliament where they would either be approved as they stood and then receive the royal assent (and so become part of the law of the land) or be rejected. This was granted at the end of the same year. The convocations lost none of their rights and the assembly could neither issue doctrinal statements nor purport to define the doctrine of the Church of England. However, by the Synodical Government Measure 1969Synodical Government Measure 1969 the overlapping functions of the assembly and the convocations were virtually eliminated by the establishment of the General Synod of the Church of England to which almost all their functions and powers were transferred. The convocations still exist, in part because their approval is required for certain legislative proposals and in part because the House of Bishops and the House of Clergy of the General Synod are constituted by the members of the corresponding houses of the convocations. Structure When clergy other than bishops began to take part in the convocations they sat together with the bishops in one single assembly and technically even today the members still constitute one single body.Cross, F.L. & Livingstone, E.A. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church OUP (1974) art. \\"Convocations of Canterbury and York\\" However, since the fifteenth century each convocation has sat as two houses: an upper house of bishops and a lower house of other clergy. The division into houses has led to claims from time to time that the lower house is independent from the upper one in the same way as the House of Commons is from the Lords. Business is normally started in the House of Bishops and sent to the House of Clergy for approval which may be refused. There are procedures by which the lower house may raise matters and submit their opinions and suggestions to the bishops. The president of each convocation as a whole and of the upper house is the archbishop of its province; each lower house elects for itself a president known as the prolocutor who is responsible for communication with the upper house. Until 1920,Neill, Stephen. Anglicanism Pelican (1960) p. 392 the upper houses had consisted of the diocesan bishops of the province and the lower houses were mainly composed of church dignitaries, the deans and archdeacons and one proctor representing each cathedral chapters and to these ex officio members were added in the case of Canterbury two representatives elected by the clergy of each diocese and in York two representatives from each archdeaconry.Kemp, Eric Waldram. Counsel and Consent SPCK (1961) p. 173 Today all diocesan bishops have a seat in their province's convocation; the suffragan bishops of a province elect a few from among themselves to join them. Most of the members of the lower house are elected by the clergy of each diocese by proportional representation from among their number,Dawes, Peter & Buchanan, Colin. Proportional Representation in Church Elections CPAS (1969) p. 3 although a handful serve ex officio or are elected by special constituencies (such as universities or cathedral deaneries). Text of relevant canonical legislationFor a convenient detailed listing see Membership of General Synod By virtue of their membership of convocation bishops and clergy are members of General Synod; thus the members of the convocations now all attend sessions of General Synod and can always conveniently meet during recesses of that body (which is, indeed, the only time they do meet nowadays). History Before 1295 Prior to 1295, the Church in England had assembled in diocesan and provincial synods to regulate disciplinary and other matters interesting the body of the clergy. Moreover, the archbishops, bishops, abbots and priors used to take their place in the national council on account of the estates they held in chief (in capite) of the English Crown. But the beneficed clergy took no part in it. The increasing frequency of royal appeals for money grants and the unwillingness of the bishops to be responsible for allowing them had brought Stephen Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury, as early as 1225, to summon proctors of cathedral, collegiate and conventual churches to attend his provincial synod, and gradually that representative principle became part of the system of Convocation. The failure of the irregular attempt of Edward I Plantagenet to convoke the clergy at Northampton led him to issue (1283) a writ to the Archbishop with a view to Convocation meeting in London in that same year, and at that meeting a \\"benevolence\\" was duly voted. After 1295 In addition to the Baronage and Commons of the realm, after 1295 a representative body of the beneficed clergy summoned to attend personally in Parliament, the summons being conveyed by the insertion, in the bishop's writ of summons to Parliament, of the proemunientes clause. That summons was the beginning of a new phase in the long struggle waged by the Crown on the subject of the taxation of the clergy. It was to facilitate the obtaining of money grants that Edward I endeavoured once more to unite representatives of the clergy and laity in one deliberative assembly, composed on the basis of temporal property. To have countenanced the attempt would have been to recognize the Crown's claim to tax church property, and the clergy insisted upon their constitutional right of making their money grants in Convocation. The struggle between the Crown and the clergy continued until 1337, when the Crown gave way, though retaining the proemunientes clause in the bishop's writ of summons. Authorities differ as to whether the Parliamentary proctors of the clergy sat in the Lower House or in the Upper House; most probably they sat and voted in the Lower House.Catholic Encyclopedia (1913) art. Convocation of the English Clergy The question of the exact relation of Convocation to the newer Parliamentary representatives of the clergy is obscure; nor is the obscurity lessened by the fact that the proctors of the clergy for Convocation were frequently the same persons as the proctors of the clergy for Parliament. Two opinions have found defenders: one that the older ecclesiastical council fused with the Parliamentary representatives of the clergy; the other, that by the process of gradual decay of Parliamentary representation of the clergy, part of their rights passed to the ecclesiastical councils, thus giving rise to the historical connection between the Convocations and Parliament. The latter view, ably advocated by Stubbs, holds the field. The division of Convocation into an Upper - and a Lower House came about gradually, and was not formed, as is sometimes supposed, on the model of the two Houses of Parliament. In 1296 the members of Convocation resolved themselves for deliberative purposes into four groups: bishops, monastic representatives, dignitaries and proctors of the clergy. Eventually Convocation came to open with a joint session presided over by the archbishop, after which the bishops and abbots remained to deliberate as the Upper House, while the rest withdrew to deliberate as the Lower House. The objection of the clergy to sitting in Parliament lessened their influence over that body; at the same time they secured the right of meeting when Parliament met, and that right of meeting involved the right of petitioning and to some extent of legislating for themselves. That idea of Convocation as the clerical parliament had important consequences; the right to tax church property was successfully maintained; but the clergy could neither elect nor be elected to the House of Commons, making a person in Holy orders ineligible for Westminster Parliament. At the same time the legislation of Convocation was binding on the clergy only and not upon the laity. The Reformation period Convocation lost its independence and saw its powers curtailed by the Act of Submission,25 Hen. VIII (1533-4), c. 19 which enacts that Convocation can only meet by royal command, and that without royal leave and licence no new canons, constitutions or ordinances may be made. This act was repealed in Queen Mary I Tudor's reign, but revived by Elizabeth I (in 1558-9), and still remains in full force. The climax of Convocation's degradation was reached when, after the Act of Supremacy (1534), Thomas Cromwell, the representative of King Henry VIII, though a layman, asserted his right to preside, a right never subsequently exercised. Post-Reformation period The Act of Submission of Henry VIII was stringently interpreted by the judges at a committee before the Lords in Parliamentin 8 Jac., 1 as forbidding, even after obtaining royal assent, any canon either against the prerogative of the king, against common law, against any statute law or against any custom of the realm. The loss of legislative independence paved the way for the loss of taxing powers, which were finally renounced in 1665, the right of voting at Parliamentary elections being obtained in return. The power of Convocation of dealing with cases of heresy has been exercised but rarely, and then to no purpose. It continued to be convoked at the beginning of each Parliament, but its sittings were interrupted from 1640 to 1660 (being largely replaced by the puritan Westminster Assembly of Divines), to be resumed after the Stuart Restoration. In 1689, in view of the opposition of the clergy to the Toleration Act of William III and Mary II, no summons was issued to Convocation. The Commons, however, protested against the innovation, and their petition had its effect; at the same time Archbishop Tillotson, and to some extent his successor Tenison, met the difficulties of the situation by refusing to allow any deliberations. Convocation was summoned, met and was prorogued. Parties were formed and claims were made, insisting upon the independence of the Lower House on the analogy of the House of Commons. Atterbury led the malcontents; Wake, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury, Kennet, Hoadly and Gibson led the defence. The question was really a political one. Toryism dominated the Lower House; Liberalism, alike in politics and theology, pervaded the Upper House. Permission to deliberate led to trouble in 1701, and prorogation followed. The Bangorian Controversy arising out of Hoadly's sermon led to similar results in 1717. The opposition of the Lower House was worn out by repeated prorogations immediately following the opening session, and with the exception of the discussions allowed in 1741 and 1742, Convocation ceased to be a deliberative body until 1852. Modern times The old organization having survived, many earnest Anglicans of the early nineteenth century, anxious to revive the synodal life of the Anglican Church, sought and obtained the relaxation of the customary immediate prorogation. A brief session was authorized in 1852. (The example was followed by York in 1859.) The action of Convocation as a deliberative body began in 1861, when, at its own request, the Crown licensed it to amend the twenty-ninth of the canons of 1603 on the subject of sponsors, and although no result followed, new canons were passed in 1865, 1887 and 1892. Apart from such general authorizations the Crown also possesses the right to submit definite business to the consideration of Convocation. This is done by \\"Special Letters of Business\\", a method used in 1872 and in 1907, in submitting the reports of the ritual commissioners to its consideration.Convocation of the English Clergy Arthur Featherstone Marshall wrote a trenchant parody of the Church of England's Convocation debates in his pseudonymous The Comedy of Convocation of the English Church (1868). Its characters include Deans Blunt, Pliable, Primitive, Pompous and Critical; Archdeacons Jolly, Theory and Chasuble; and Doctors Easy, Viewy and Candour. Lay representation developed from the House of Laymen, which first met in connection with the Convocation of Canterbury in 1886 (York, 1892), and formally in legislation in the Church Assembly (1919) and General Synod (1970).

Permanent Missions of the United Kingdom to the United Nations are maintained in New York City, Geneva, and Vienna. These diplomatic missions represent the UK during negotiations and ensure Britain's interests and views are taken into account by UN bodies and other member states.; ; United Kingdom's role in establishing the UN On 12 June 1941, representatives of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, and of the exiled governments of Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Yugoslavia, as well as General de Gaulle of France, met in London and signed the Declaration of St. James' Palace. This was the first of six conferences that led up to the founding of the United Nations and the Charter of the United Nations. Following the drafting of the Atlantic Charter in August 1941 by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt, Churchill visited the White House for three weeks in December 1941. During the visit, the name \\"United Nations\\" was suggested by Roosevelt to Churchill to refer to the Allies of World War II. Roosevelt proposed it as an alternative to \\"Associated Powers\\", a term the U.S. used in the First World War (the U.S. was never formally a member of the Allies of World War I but entered the war in 1917 as a self-styled \\"Associated Power\\"). Churchill accepted the idea noting the phrase was used by Lord Byron in the poem Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, which referred to the Allies at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. The name appeared in the \\"Declaration by United Nations\\", which was drafted by Roosevelt and Churchill with Roosevelt's aide Harry Hopkins while meeting at the White House in December 1941. The phrase \\"Four Policemen\\" was coined to refer to the four major Allied countries, the United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and the Republic of China. The term United Nations was first officially used when 26 governments signed this Declaration in January 1942. The concept of the United Nations as an international organisation to replace the ineffective League of Nations was formulated and negotiated among the delegations from the U.S., the U.K., the Soviet Union and China at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in 1944. Winston Churchill urged Roosevelt to restore France to its status of a major Power after the liberation of Paris in August 1944. After months of planning, the UN Conference on International Organization opened in San Francisco in April 1945 attended by 50 governments and a number of non-governmental organisations involved in drafting the United Nations Charter. The heads of the delegations of the sponsoring countries took turns as chairman of the plenary meetings beginning with Anthony Eden of Britain. The UN officially came into existence on 24 October 1945 upon ratification of the Charter by the five permanent members of the Security Council‚Äîthe U.S., the U.K., France, the Soviet Union and the Republic of China‚Äîand by a majority of the other 46 signatories. The first meetings of the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council took place in London beginning on 6 January 1946. The General Assembly met in Westminster Central Hall, and the Security Council met at Church House, Westminster. Veto power in the UN Security Council The United Kingdom has used its Security Council veto power on 32 occasions. The first occurrence was in October 1956 when the United Kingdom and France vetoed a letter from the US to the president of the Security Council concerning Palestine. The most recent was in December 1989 when the United Kingdom, France and the United States vetoed a draft resolution condemning the United States invasion of Panama. Along with France, the United Kingdom used its power to veto a draft resolution aimed at resolving the Suez Canal crisis in 1956. The UK and France eventually withdrew after the US instigated an 'emergency special session' of the General Assembly, under the terms of the \\"Uniting for Peace\\" resolution, which led to the establishment of the United Nations Emergency Force I (UNEF I), by the adoption of Assembly resolution 1001. The UK also used its veto seven times in relation to Rhodesia from 1963 to 1973, five of these occasions were unilateral which are the only occasions on which the UK has used its veto power unilaterally. Modernisation and reform The United Kingdom has stated its support for modernisation of the United Nations and reform the Security Council. According to a formal statement made jointly by the United Kingdom and France in 2008: > Reform of the UNSC, both its enlargement and the improvement of its working > methods, must therefore succeed. We reaffirm the support of our two > countries for the candidacies of Germany, Brazil, India and Japan for > permanent membership, as well as for permanent representation for Africa on > the Council. ...

We will work in this direction in the > coming months with a view to achieving effective reform. Military operations and peacekeeping Under the United Nations Command, the United Kingdom participated in the Korean War from 1950‚Äì53. In more recent times, the UK has contributed to a number of United Nations peacekeeping missions. In the 1990s, British Armed Forces were part of the United Nations Protection Force from 1992‚Äì1995 that intervened in the Bosnian War. The 2000 British military intervention in the Sierra Leone Civil War supported the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone. Acting under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 in 2011, the UK and other NATO countries intervened in the Libyan Civil War. As the fifth largest provider of financial contributions to United Nations peacekeeping, the UK provided 6.7 percent of the budget in 2013‚Äì15. In September 2015, the UK was contributing 286 troops and five police officers to United Nations peacekeeping missions. In November 1990, it was contributing 769. The Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015 included a commitment to double the number of UK military personnel contributed to UN peacekeeping operations as well as increasing the number of UK law enforcement and civilian experts on UN peace operations and in UN headquarters.

Biography George F. Huff was born in Norristown, Pennsylvania. He attended the public schools in Middletown, Pennsylvania, and later in Altoona, Pennsylvania. At the age of eighteen he worked for the Pennsylvania Railroad car shops in Altoona. He moved to Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania in 1867 and engaged in banking in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. He later became largely identified with the industrial and mining interests of western Pennsylvania. He was a delegate to the 1880 Republican National Convention. He was a member of the Pennsylvania State Senate from 1884 to 1888. Huff was elected as a Republican to the Fifty- second Congress. He was again elected to the Fifty-fourth Congress. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1896. Huff was again elected to the Fifty- eighth and to the three succeeding Congresses. He served as chairman of the United States House Committee on Mines and Mining during the Sixtieth and Sixty-first Congresses. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1910. Personal life On March 16, 1871, Huff married the former Henrietta Burrell, a daughter of Jeremiah M. Burrell, President Judge of the Tenth Judicial District of Pennsylvania. They were the parents of eight children. Along with sixty-odd wealthy Western Pennsylvanians including Andrew Carnegie, Andrew Mellon and Henry Clay Frick, Huff was a member of the elite South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club whose earthen dam at Lake Conemaugh failed on May 31, 1889, causing the Johnstown Flood. He died in Washington, D.C. in 1912, aged 69. He was interred in St. Clair Cemetery in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. Huff's Dupont Circle mansion, designed by Horace Trumbauer and Julian Abele and built in 1906, was sold by his widow in 1913 to the Argentine Ministry of Foreign Relations, and has since housed the Embassy of Argentina.

The main town lies at Jalrez, which is southwest of the centre of Kabul via the main Kabul-Behsud Highway. The district is a major producer of potatoes. History Jalrez lay along the Silk Road between Kabul and Banyan. The name is believed to derive from the Dari words \\"jal\\", meaning 'light reflection' and \\"rez\\" meaning 'to pour', possibly related to the confluence of two rivers in the area. Prior to 1964, Jalrez District belonged to the Maidan alaqadari (subdistrict) of Kabul province. Due to its strategical importance geographical, Jalrez has a long history of conflict, which has capitulated since the Saur Revolution of 1978. Jalrez was one of the first districts to be captured by the mujahedin in 1979 during the war against the Soviet-backed Afghan communist regime. The mujahedin crossed the Onai Pass in the spring, taking Sarchashma and burning the school there, before moving on to take Takana and Jalrez in the district. Their control ended at the end of the year when a Soviet strike killed 60 to 70 of the mujahedin. An allegiance of jihadi tanzim groups such as Mawlawi Muhammad Nabi Muhammadi's Harakat-e Enqelab-e Islami and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Islami united in the spring to recapture the district. During the Afghan Civil War of 1992‚Äì96, the jihadi tanzims concentrated most of their efforts in the Kabul area, and there were only a few skirmishes against Wahdat and Ettehad forces in Jalrez district. The Taliban has reemerged since 2003 and the area is subject to ongoing conflict. The Taliban attacked the town of Kot-e Ashro in 2006, which was the former seat of the district. According to the National Statistics and Information Authority (NSIA)‚Äôs annual survey book, the district had approximately 57,870 people in 2018-19. In July 2019, a 203rd \\"Thunder\\" Corps airstrike killed 15 Taliban militants in Nirk District, including Qari Syed Agha, a commander of the Haqqani terrorist network who was based in Zaiwalat in Jalrez District. Geography Jalrez District is situated in the central- east part of the country in Maidan Wardak Province, with the district town of Jalrez lying by road southwest of the centre of Kabul. The district is bordered by Hisa-I-Awali Bihsud District to the west, Daimirdad District to the southwest, Nirkh District to the southeast, Maidan Shar District to the east-southeast, Parwan Province to the north and Kabul Province to the east- northeast. The district is dominated by the Jalrez Valley, with a length of , and numerous secondary valleys. The principal rivers are the Sarchashma River, the upstream part of the Kabul River which passes through the Onai Pass, and the Sanglakh River, which flows through the valley of the same name. Subdivisions The district is divided into five administrative sub-units (hawzaha-ye edari): *Jalrez *Zaiwalat *Sanglakh *Takana *Sarchashma Demographics The district is home to a significant population of Hazaras, a number of which claim to be descendants of Timur. Pashtuns of the Ghilzai tribal confederacy, primarily Hotak, Amarkhel and Ibrahimkhel live in the Maidan Shar and Jalrez valleys. Some Tajiks live in Jalrez and Takana. Economy and services Local children in the Jalrez Valley The district is a major producer and exporter of potatoes, but also produces apples, onions, rice, wheat, barley, mung beans, spinach, carrots, almonds, apricots and spinach. In 2008 there were 134,700 livestock in the district, of which 50,000 were sheep. As of 2018 Jalrez has nine high schools, 11 middle schools and nine primary schools, run by the Ministry of Education (MoE) in conjunction with local councils and the education commission of the Taliban. There were a reported 358 teachers, of which 41 were women. The five health clinics in the district, consisting of one comprehensive health centre, three basic health centres and one sub-health centre as of 2018 were owned by the state and operated by the Swedish Committee for Afghanistan (SCA).

Chen Changxing is a slightly mysterious character and much controversy surrounds him. He is most known as the teacher of the great taijiquan master Yang Luchan, but there is much disagreement over which style of martial art Chen Changxing actually taught to the family outsider. Some schools of thought suggest that Chen Changxing was a maverick who practiced and taught a style of martial art that was not part of the Chen Family martial arts tradition, and that was passed to him either directly or indirectly from a taijiquan master known as Jiang Fa. Some other schools of thought suggest that Chen Changxing re-worked two or more of the traditional Chen Family routines into his own style and then taught it to Yang Luchan and others. Both schools successfully explain why the taijiquan that Yang Luchan's descendants now practice is substantially different from the modern Chen routines, but neither theory can be completely substantiated and thus much controversy remains. At the same time, the members of the Chen clan believe that not much changed in Chen Taijiquan from the times preceding Chen Changxing, nor after him besides, perhaps, the sequence of the movements and their grouping in to the forms. The differences between Chen Taijiquan and other big styles are mostly attributed to the independent development of non-Chen styles in the modern and pre-modern eras. The visual representation of the Sun style, for instance, looks strikingly different from the Yang style, which in its turn mirrors the Chen style to a high degree, both in the appearance and movements names. Chen Changxing is said to have been of an irreverent character and was given the nickname \\"Mr Ancestral Tablet\\" due to the directness of his posture. In \\"The Genealogy of the Chen Family\\" he is noted as a martial arts instructor, but the detail of the style he taught is not present.

Chuck never went anywhere (even on dates) without his puppet Bob, who basically said all the things that Chuck was too polite (or repressed) to say. Television Jay also starred in Broken Badges (1990), a Stephen Cannell CBS television production where he played a psychologically depressed police officer named Stanley Jones, who was also a ventriloquist. He has also appeared as a celebrity guest on many game shows and hosted two series of his own, So You Think You Got Troubles (1983) and Celebrity Charades (1979). Jay's television roles also include a guest appearance in an episode of Mrs. Columbo where he played a ventriloquist who finds his dummy is acting independently of his will and kills the man who carved it. His post-Soap TV career included appearances on The Love Boat, Gimme a Break!, Simon & Simon, The Facts of Life, Empty Nest (reuniting him with his father from Soap, Richard Mulligan) and Dave's World. In 1999, he reprised his role of Chuck (and Bob) Campbell in an episode of That '70s Show.

Live theater Jay Johnson: The Two & Only! written and performed by Jay Johnson, opened on Broadway to rave reviews at the Helen Hayes Theatre on September 28, 2006. This was preceded by an acclaimed off-Broadway run at the Atlantic Theatre Company in New York. The show also performed at the Zero Arrow Theatre, Cambridge, MA, and the Brentwood and Colony Theater Company in Los Angeles. The Cambridge performance garnered the New England Critics Award, and in Los Angeles Johnson received the 2006 Ovation Award for Best Solo Performance. The show deconstructs and demonstrates Johnson's lifelong obsession with the art of ventriloquism. The show is a Valentine, not only to the art, but also to his mentor and friend Arthur Sieving, who created Johnson's first professional puppet. The show is aided and abetted by a cast of ventriloquated characters, including his Soap alter ego, Bob. Johnson won the 2007 Tony Award for Best Special Theatrical Event for the show. He is the only ventriloquist to ever be nominated and win an American Theatre Wing Tony Award or an Ovation Award. The show was filmed on September 15, 2012, in Thalian Hall in Wilmington, NC. Johnson enlisted film and stage director Bryan W. Simon to direct the film adaptation of the performance. Johnson first met Simon in 2009 when he starred in the comedy documentary I'm No Dummy, IMDB: I'm No Dummy https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0926091/ Digital Cinema Report http://digitalcinemareport.com/node/1165 directed by Bryan W. Simon. The original Bob puppet featured on Soap was inducted into the Smithsonian Institutions collections of pop culture icons in May 2007.

Design The S&W; 4006 features a stainless steel frame and slide, double action/single action handgun with 4-inch barrel, slide-mounted de-cock/safety and an 11-round staggered-column magazine. It was one of the new 3rd-generation S&W; semi-autos, designed with input from famed gunsmith Wayne Novak of Parkersburg, WV. The 4006 introduced the new .40 S&W; cartridge and featured a wraparound one-piece grip made of Xenoy versus the earlier standard 2-piece grip panels, as well as low-profile 3-dot Novak sights. A lightweight aluminum alloy‚Äìframed S&W; 4003/4043 was produced that weighed 800 grams (29 ounces) and was more comfortable to carry. The 4046 model was a DAO (double-action-only) pistol in all stainless steel. The first 2 digits in the model number indicate caliber. The last digit, either a 3 or 6, indicates aluminum or stainless steel frame, respectively. Various safety features include a safety lever (which blocks the firing pin from the hammer) as well as a magazine safety (which keeps the pistol from firing when no magazine is inserted). While a true double-action pistol, the firearm shares this magazine disconnect feature with Browning Hi-Power pistols: it cannot be fired without the magazine in place. This feature was developed to meet the needs of various law enforcement agencies interested in providing another level of safety for their officers.

The play focuses on May and Eddie, former lovers who have met again in a motel in the desert. The play premiered in 1983 at the Magic Theatre in San Francisco, where Shepard was the playwright-in-residence. The play was a finalist for the 1984 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. The play is part of a quintet which includes Shepard's Family Trilogy: Curse of the Starving Class (1977), Buried Child (1979), and True West (1980). The quintet concludes with Fool for Love and A Lie of the Mind (1985).Roudan√©, Matthew (2002). The Cambridge Companion to Sam Shepard. Cambridge University Press, Plot The \\"fools\\" in the play are battling lovers at a run-down Mojave Desert motel. May is staying at the motel when an old flame, Eddie, shows up. Eddie tries to convince May to come back to him and live in a trailer on a farm in Wyoming that Eddie has always wanted to buy and where he has always imagined living with May. May vehemently refuses. She says that she has absolutely no interest in living with Eddie under such circumstances, that she has a job and started a new life and knows that if she goes back to Eddie their relationship will repeat the same destructive cycle it has followed before. Throughout the play the character of the Old Man--apparently the father of both lovers--sits to the side and talks to May and Eddie and offers commentary on each character and about himself. It is revealed that the Old Man had led a double life, abandoning each family for different periods during each child's life. The two became lovers in their high school years and when their parents finally figured out what had occurred, Eddie's mother shot herself. May is afraid that Eddie has begun to emulate his father; taking to drinking and secretly seeing a woman May refers to as the Countess. The play centers around the drama of the confrontation rather than a plot with any rising and falling action. In the end Eddie appears to have left May, just as his father had left his mother, and May has packed her suitcase to go off somewhere unspecified. Eddie and May have not reconciled, the Old Man has begun to drift off in denial that Eddie's mother had been driven to suicide, and May's erstwhile date, Martin, is left on stage bewildered to observe it all. Themes and analysis Sean Murray, the artistic director of Cygnet Theatre, San Diego, spoke of True West and Fool for Love, which he presented in repertory in 2014: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a definite crisis of identity going on in both these plays... And it‚Äôs as if both sets of [main characters] are doomed to be together... Both plays are about family and genealogy and being connected to your genetic brood,...

It is located at the junction of the Park Road and William Street.The People's Park , Waterford City Council website The current site of the People's Park was originally a marshland which John's River ran through, however in 1857 the river was diverted and the marshland drained to make way for the construction of the park. The park contains a Victorian-era bandstand, the Goff cycle track, a children's playground, a spherical monument and water feature and an old painted iron bridge connecting the park to the grounds of the Court House. The park has been renovated and upgraded in recent years. The old caretaker's house has been carefully renovated and a small extension has been added with a cafe called the Park Lodge now occupying the structure. A baby playground area has also been built. On 12 July 2006, ‚Ç¨1 million funding was announced to continue refurbishment. Perhaps the most important element of the aforementioned refurbishment is the inclusion of a skateboarding park. Vandalism In May 2011, there was outcry amongst the community as the Victorian bandstand was attacked by vandals who, under cover of darkness, pulled down and shattered much of the ornate wrought iron railings surrounding it.

SlickEdit includes such features as built in beautifiers that can beautify code as you type, code navigation, context tagging (also known as Intelligent code completion), symbol references, third party tool integration, DiffZilla (a file differencing tool), syntax highlighting, and over 13 keyboard emulations. In 2014 SlickEdit released a SlickEdit Standard version of their product and renamed their original product SlickEdit Pro. History SlickEdit began in 1988 as a character-mode editor for DOS and OS/2. Clark Maurer, currently CEO of SlickEdit Inc. (formerly MicroEdge Inc.), was employed at IBM's Watson research lab. He was the developers of the internal IBM editor E; the most popular internal program used at IBM at the time. This experience enabled him to quit IBM and begin development of the first SlickEdit releases.http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3823 At the beginning of the '90s, most DOS editors were struggling with limitations of the 16-bit address space or DOS memory handling (640k). SlickEdit's programmers found a way to overcome these limitations. SlickEdit's current version can now handle large files of up to 2 TB in size. As operating systems with graphical user interfaces became more popular, SlickEdit continued to produce versions of the program with high functionality and good usability. Today SlickEdit is feature rich in C++, C Sharp, Java, JavaScript, PHP, HTML, Objective-C, Groovy, Google Go, and many more. SlickEdit can be used for everything from Web Development, IOS Development, Android software development, and Desktop Development to Mainframe Development. SlickEdit supports debugging for GNU C/C++, Java, WinDbg, Groovy, Google Go, Python, Perl, Ruby, PHP, Xcode, and Android JVM/NDK. SlickEdit is currently working on Version 22 of their product. Supported languages and operating systems SlickEdit supports over 70 programming languages and file types,SlickEdit's supported languages including C, C++, C#, Groovy (programming language), Java, JavaScript, Objective-C, Go, HTML, PHP, XML, Windows batch files, AWK, Makefiles and INI files. SlickEdit also supports opening Visual Studio solutions and Xcode projects as workspaces. A partial list of languages includes: Some of these are only supported with syntax highlighting, such as Makefiles and INI files.

Until version 4.0b, SlickEdit supported the OS/2 operating system. Slick-C Slick-C is the proprietary scripting language of the editor. Much of the editor is actually written in Slick-C, and all the Slick-C source code is included with the product. This means that the user can look at how things work and modify the behavior to suit their needs. As the name suggests, the language resembles C, though it has some elements from REXX (parse, substr, ...). The original author of Slick-C liked the string parsing features of REXX and added similar features to Slick-C .

The council's first act was to grant special protection to the persons of the king and his family. As to this and royal elections the council made the following decrees: *Only the higher nobility (with military functions) and the Visigothic palatine officials could participate in royal elections. *The descendants of the king had the right to enjoy properties justly acquired by the king and willed to them. Anathema was pronounced on those who molested or injured the king. The closest councillors of the king were also protected in their possession of properties granted them by their royal patron. *Those who consulted seers to know the future of the king, who cursed the king, or who plotted or conspired to place another on the throne would be excommunicated. Those who aspired to the throne without due election were also anathematised. *The council established three days of litanies between 13 and 15 December each year. The councils decrees, however, failed in their chief political aim of securing the king on his throne and putting an end to internal intrigues. Chintila continued to have to fight dissenters while Spain was otherwise at peace with the outside world. In 638, Chintila was forced to convoke the Sixth Council of Toledo. Sources *Thompson, E. A.

He first appeared in the Comics Buyer's Guide.''' Character Biography A German scientist born in 1885 Frankfurt, von Klempt displayed a keen interest in cybernetics that disturbed his family and other people, save his friend Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, while attending a Berlin medical school. The two men apparently shared similar ideas as both became members of the Sonnenrad Society, von Klempt using the organization's resources to develop the Kriegsaffe (German, \\"war ape\\"), a sort of Frankenstein's monster-like simian enforcers. In 1936, von Klempt died in a laboratory explosion that destroyed most of his body, Kroenen managing to keep von Klempt's head alive in a bell jar that was later attached to a robotic body. While Kroenen later became a disciple of Rasputin, Von Klempt considered the man a fraud and refused to participate in Project Ragna Rok. In 1939, Von Klempt participated in the Nazi Space Program where the corpse of the recently deceased physicist Ernst Oeming is offered to non-corporeal beings seeking a host with the promise of aiding the Nazis and ensure the rocket's lift-off despite interference from Lobster Johnson. B.P.R.D.: 1946 and Comic buyer's guide In 1946, Von Klempt retreated to a secret base on Berlin after Nazi Germany fell to the allies, intending to use the vampires of Vampir Sturm project. But a young Prof. Bruttenholm thwarted the scheme, Von Klempt escaping Europe after the war and built a laboratory under an old Portuguese prisoner in Terroso, Brazil. Von Klempt attempted to use an undead army to resurrect the Third Reich in 1952, only to be thwarted by Hellboy whom he encountered again in the jungle near Macap√°, Brazil, where was prolonging his life using the spinal fliud of abducted peasant girls In the fight that ensued, Hellboy defeated von Klempt and his Kriegsaffe \\"Brutus\\". Von Klempt's inert head would not be seen for decades. Wake the Devil When Kroenen awakened from suspended animation with his fellow Project Ragna Rok members Ilsa Haupstein and Leopold Kurtz in 1994 by Roderick Zinco, he sent Zinco to Brazil to retrieve von Klempt's head. Once revived, von Klempt tried convincing Kroenen to abandon Rasputin's plan to awaken the Ogdru Jahad, and instead use Zinco's resources to retrieve von Klempt's projects in South America, which he promised could let them rule the world. Overhearing, Kurtz began attacking von Klempt's head, and Kroenen stabbed Kurtz in a panic. Furious at von Klempt and Kroenen, Rasputin's ghost blinded Zinco, who accidentally set off an explosion that destroyed the castle. Conqueror Worm and B.P.R.D.: The Black Flame Somehow surviving the castle's detonation, von Klempt's head retreated to a secret laboratory under a graveyard in Germany. There he began work on his Kriegaffe #10, but was suddenly stricken with despair over the seemingly endless failures of his life and the loss of his purpose: Hitler's Third Reich had collapsed, as had all his plans for world domination. In this moment of weakness, he was contacted by Rasputin's ghost, whom von Klempt mistakenly believed to be the Angel of Death. Rasputin reminded von Klempt of the Nazi Space Project, and showed him the destruction that would be unleashed if Dr. Oeming's capsule return to Earth with the thing that now inhabited his body was released. Von Klempt, finally given purpose - to watch the destruction of the world - returned after sixty years to Hunte Castle. Secretly, Rasputin's aim was still the same: once the world had been overtaken, the Ogdru Hem would be released from their prisons, and they would, in turn, release the Ogdru Jahad, who would reduce the world to ashes. Von Klempt contacted his granddaughter, Inger. Believing that they were unlocking a power that would help them rule the world, Inger helped her grandfather to restore the equipment at Hunte Castle and recall Dr. Oeming's capsule to Earth. A gigantic creature called \\"The Conqueror Worm\\" surged forth from the capsule. Spewing a noxious gas, the worm turned von Klempt's human agents into frog-men, then devoured them immediately to feed its insatiable hunger. Only quick intervention by Hellboy and Roger the Homunculus, aided by the ghost of Lobster Johnson, managed to halt the worm's march. Von Klempt was pulled off of a cliff by Roger with the madman's jar was smashed. But Von Klempt's head was retrieve by Landis Pope of the Zinco Corporation and placed among Pope's collection of Nazi memorabilia in his office. Following the intense battle between the Black Flame and Liz Sherman, von Klempt's head was spirited out of the ruins of Manhattan by Kroenen before being revived by Varvara.

The latter two were indicted in April 1972 for the killing of a prison corrections officer; they were convicted in January 1974.John Schwartz, \\"Herman Wallace, Freed After 41 Years in Solitary, Dies at 71\\", The New York Times, 4 October 2013; accessed 12 March 2019 Wallace and Woodfox served more than 40 years each in solitary, the \\"longest period of solitary confinement in American prison history.\\"Erwin James, \\"37 years of solitary confinement: the Angola three\\", The Guardian, 10 March 2010; accessed 12 December 2017 Robert King was convicted of a separate prison murder in 1973 and spent 29 years in solitary confinement before his conviction was overturned on appeal; he was released in 2001 after taking a plea deal. From the late 1990s, each case was assessed, and activists began to work to have the cases appealed and convictions overturned because of doubts raised about the original trials. In July 2013, Amnesty International called for the release of 71-year-old Herman Wallace, who had been diagnosed with terminal liver cancer. He was released October 1, 2013. The state re-indicted him on October 3, 2013, but he died on October 4, 2013, before he could be re- arrested. On November 20, 2014, Woodfox's conviction was overturned by the US Court of Appeals. In April 2015, his lawyer applied for an unconditional writ for his release. His unconditional release was decided on June 10, 2015. He was released on February 19, 2016, after the prosecution agreed to drop its push for a retrial and accept his plea of no contest to lesser charges of burglary and manslaughter. He said he would have liked the chance to prove his innocence, but chose the plea deal because of advanced age and health issues. Initial imprisonment Wallace and Woodfox were each sent to Angola Prison in 1971: Wallace was convicted of bank robbery, and Woodfox was convicted of armed robbery. Woodfox was sentenced to 50 years in prison. Woodfox had escaped from the Orleans Parish courthouse during his sentencing hearing and fled to Harlem in New York City. There he was captured and jailed pending extradition to Louisiana. During this period, he met men for the first time who were members of the Black Panther Party. They taught other inmates to read, led political discussions, and began his education. \\"For Woodfox, the teachings of the Panthers were revelatory, giving his life a direction and moral meaning he had never previously found.\\"Rosa Brooks, Outlook: \\"What one man's 40 years in solitary says about America's criminal justice system\\", The Washington Post, March 7, 2019; accessed March 9, 2019 He joined the Black Panther Party and kept his intellectual connection after it dissolved. He began to learn about African-American history and the justice system. When returned to Louisiana, Woodfox was incarcerated at Angola. At Angola, Wallace also became a member of the Black Panthers. He and Woodfox were among activists seeking to improve conditions at the notoriously cruel and violent prison. They helped organize education of other prisoners, and petitions and hunger strikes to protest segregation within the prison, and to end widespread rape and violence. They were targeted by the prison administration, who feared the politically active prisoners. The day after a prison guard was burned to death in 1972, 23-year-old prison guard Brent Miller was found dead of multiple stab wounds. Woodfox and Wallace were indicted and convicted of his murder, although there was no physical evidence linking them, witnesses were weak, and exculpatory evidence was withheld. King had also been convicted of robbery, but he was not assigned to Angola until after Miller's murder. (He said he was accused of acting as a \\"prison lawyer\\" for other inmates. He was convicted in 1973 in a separate prison murder.) These three men were soon taken out of the general prison population and were held in solitary confinement. Rahim and Fleming investigation In 1997, Malik Rahim, a community activist in New Orleans and a former Black Panther member, together with young lawyer Scott Fleming, who had worked as a prisoner advocate while a law student, learned that Wallace, King, and Woodfox were still incarcerated in solitary confinement. (Wallace had written to Fleming appealing for help in his case.) The two men initiated an investigation of the case, challenging the conclusions of the original investigations at Angola about the murder of guard Miller, and also raising questions about the conduct of the prisoners' original trials in 1972. Anita Roddick, founder of the Body Shop and known for her humanitarian activism, learned about the case from Fleming and helped raise international awareness about the Angola Three. Appeals and transfers On appeal, Woodfox's 1974 conviction for the murder of Miller was overturned in 1993, on the constitutional grounds of inadequate counsel at the first trial. The state quickly indicted Woodfox again that year, the result of a grand jury that was headed by a white foreman appointed by the court. In 1998 Woodfox was convicted a second time for the prison murder. His defense mounted another appeal. King's 1973 conviction, on charges unrelated to Miller's murder, was overturned in 2001 on appeal. The court ordered a new trial. While the state had the option to dismiss the charges, it reindicted King and said it would retry him. Before going to trial, the prosecutor offered him a plea deal, with the sentences for the lower charges to be offset by the time he had already served. King took the plea in order to gain release after 29 years in solitary confinement, but he said that he was innocent of the charges. He was released in 2001, the first of the Angola 3 to gain freedom. In 2000, the Angola Three filed a civil suit against the Louisiana Department of Corrections \\"challenging the inhumane and increasingly pervasive practice of long-term solitary confinement\\". They seek damages against the state Department of Corrections because of the adverse effects of extended time in solitary confinement. As of 2019, their case is still pending. While the men's civil suit and appeals of their cases were pending, in March 2008 Woodfox and Wallace were moved to a maximum-security dormitory at Angola. They had each been held for 36 years in solitary confinement. State Representative Cedric Richmond (D-New Orleans) (now a Congressman) was granted permission to visit them, which authorities rarely granted. He told an NPR reporter that he believed that they had been moved from solitary because of increasing political pressure about the case, as well as the men's civil suit against the state regarding solitary confinement.Laura Sullivan, \\"'Angola 2' Leave Solitary Cells in La. After 36 Years\\", NPR, 27 March 2008; accessed 12 March 2019 Woodfox had two appeal hearings in federal district court (one in November 2008 and one in May 2010), which resulted in his second conviction being overturned and his being granted full habeas corpus. The rulings by the federal district court were overturned by the federal Fifth District Circuit Court of Appeals. Immediately after Woodfox's first appeal hearing in November 2008, both men were moved out of the maximum-security dormitory, separated, and returned to solitary confinement. In March 2009 Wallace, along with a group of 15 inmates from Angola, was moved to Elayn Hunt Correctional Center and placed in a newly created closed-cell isolation tier. The state argues that this is not solitary confinement. In November 2010, Woodfox was moved from Angola to David Wade Correctional Center. It is seven hours north of New Orleans and distant from his family and supporters. Both Wallace and Woodfox, who had served past their original sentences for armed robbery, have allegedly suffered from a range of different medical issues‚Äîsome due in part to their reported conditions of confinement and their enforced sedentary lifestyle. Prison officials had long maintained that the reason for keeping Wallace and Woodfox in solitary confinement was out of concern that they would instigate a prison uprising because of their belonging to the Black Panthers. In July 2013 Wallace was diagnosed with advanced liver cancer. He had earlier been thought to have a stomach condition. Wallace's defense team had filed a writ of habeas corpus, saying that he had not received a fair trial and was thus being held illegally by the state. In October 2013 federal district judge Brian A. Jackson ruled that Wallace had not received a fair trial because no women were included on his jury. Judge Jackson vacated the original grand jury indictment and ordered Wallace's immediate release. the original indictment was unconstitutional. The state announced its intention to re-indict Wallace for Miller's murder, but he died on October 4, 2013, a few days after being released from jail. In March 2013, a federal District Court judge in New Orleans overturned Woodfox's second (1998) conviction for the prison murder, ruling that it was based on racially discriminatory grounds because a white foreman had been appointed to the grand jury, and that this was part of a pattern of discriminatory practice found in the state. Louisiana Attorney General James Caldwell promised to appeal the District Court's decision, saying, ‚ÄúWe feel confident that we will again prevail at the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. However, if we do not, we are fully prepared and willing to retry this murderer again.‚Äù On November 20, 2014, a three-person panel of Fifth Circuit judges unanimously upheld the lower court's opinion that Woodfox's conviction had been secured through racially discriminatory means. The panel found that the selection of a white grand-jury foreperson in the 1993 indictment hearing prior to trial formed part of a discriminatory pattern in that area of Louisiana. Concluding that this action amounted to a violation of the US Constitution, the judges struck down Woodfox's conviction. The state of Louisiana refused to release Woodfox, pending their decision as to whether to pursue a new trial against him. The prison also refused to move him out of solitary confinement. On February 12, 2015, the state indicted Woodfox for a third time for the 1972 murder of Brent Miller, the prison guard. On June 8, 2015, U.S. District Judge James Brady ordered the release of Woodfox, after having overturned his second conviction for the killing of the guard Miller. His order barred a third trial from taking place, as he noted that most of the witnesses had died and he believed that it was unlikely that Woodfox could gain a fair trial. He also noted ‚Äúevidence suggesting Mr. Woodfox's innocence.‚Äù Four days later, the majority of a three-judge panel of the US Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Brady's decision. It directed that the state could hold Woodfox in prison until the matter was resolved, and that it could mount a third trial. \\"The dissenting judge, James L. Dennis, agreed with Judge Brady that the state had failed to remedy the problem of racial discrimination [in the second trial]. Judge Dennis noted that more than a dozen witnesses, including the state's only purported eyewitness to the murder and two alibi witnesses for Mr. Woodfox, were no longer alive.\\"Ashley Southall, \\"Albert Woodfox, Angola Inmate, Can Be Tried 3rd Time, Court Rules\\", New York Times, 9 November 2015; accessed 12 March 2019 The state announced that it would try Woodfox for murder a third time. But it offered him a plea deal after negotiation with his defense. Woodfox pleaded \\"no contest\\" (nolo contendere) to lesser charges of manslaughter and aggravated burglary. Together with his time for armed robbery, he had already served 45 years, the total of the sentences for those crimes. He was released based on time served, on February 19, 2016, his 69th birthday. Woodfox's civil suit filed in 2000, with plaintiffs King and Wallace, is still pending against the Louisiana Department of Corrections over the practice of extended solitary confinement. Releases Robert King King was released in 2001, following 29 years in solitary confinement. His first conviction was overturned on appeal, and he pleaded guilty to a lesser conspiracy to commit murder charge. Herman Wallace In July 2013 Amnesty International called for Herman Wallace's release on humanitarian grounds, saying, \\"Wallace is 71 years old and has advanced liver cancer. After decades of cruel conditions and a conviction that continues to be challenged by the courts, he should be released immediately to his family so that he can be cared for humanely during his last months.\\" He had been transferred to the hospital unit in his prison. On October 1, 2013, Wallace was granted immediate release by U.S. District Chief Judge Brian A. Jackson of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, ending Wallace's forty-year incarceration in solitary confinement. The court had overturned Wallace's conviction in the murder of Miller, based on the unconstitutional exclusion of women from his jury, in violation of the 14th Amendment.\\"The Angola 3 Case: What You Need to Know\\", International Coalition to Free the Angola 3 website Jackson ordered a new trial. The state chose to prosecute Wallace again for the murder of Miller, although he was dying of liver cancer. Wallace was taken to the house of a close friend in New Orleans. The state appealed the judge's orders, seeking to keep Wallace in prison. When East Baton Rouge District Attorney Hillar Moore appealed Judge Jackson's order, Jackson responded with a threat of charging him with contempt of court. Jackie Sumell, a Wallace supporter, visited him at the Louisiana State University Medical Center in New Orleans after his release. She said, \\"This is a tremendous victory and a miracle that Herman Wallace will die a free man.\\" She continued, \\"He's had 42 years of maintaining his innocence in solitary confinement, and if his last few breaths are as a free man, we‚Äôve won.\\" On October 3, 2013, a West Feliciana Parish grand jury indicted Wallace again for the 1972 murder of Miller, the corrections officer. Herman Wallace died on October 4, 2013, three days after being released from prison. Albert Woodfox Amnesty International called for the release of Woodfox after Wallace's release. He had been held in solitary confinement since 1972. After more court challenges, Woodfox was finally released from prison in February 2016, after being imprisoned for 45 years, 43 of them in solitary confinement. At the time, he spoke to a reporter from The New York Times and said, ‚ÄúWhen I began to understand who I was, I considered myself free.‚Äù He was referring to learning via the Black Panthers and reading while in prison about his history as an African American and racial inequities in the US. Since his release, Woodfox has written a memoir, Solitary: Unbroken by Four Decades in Solitary Confinement. My Story of Transformation and Hope (2019), about his early life and four decades in prison. Dwight Garner of The New York Times said that it was \\"uncommonly powerful\\". Opposition to release Miller's family continued to oppose Woodfox's release, believing that he was guilty. His father had worked in the prison, and a brother was a prison guard at the same time as Brent Miller. Another brother had earlier served as a prison guard. They were not changed in their opinions by the wavering of witnesses and lack of physical evidence in the case. But Miller's widow, Teenie Verret, came to doubt Wallace and Woodfox's guilt. \\"If they did not do this,\\" she says, \\"and I believe that they didn't, they have been living a nightmare.\\" State officials continued to strongly oppose the inmates' release. Louisiana's Attorney General, James Caldwell, said in 2013 that he opposed releasing the two men \\"with every fiber of my being.\\" He said that they had never been held in solitary confinement but were in \\"protective cell units known as CCR [Closed Cell Restricted]\\". Burl Cain, the former warden of Angola, repeatedly said in 2008 and 2009 that Woodfox and Wallace had to be held in CCR because they subscribed to \\"Black Pantherism.\\" Popular interest and representation in other media Albert Woodfox and Robert King at an Angola Three event at Manchester Metropolitan University, November 2016. These cases received increased national and international interest following publicity related to King's release in 2001. Supporters mounted new challenges by appeals in court. Since his release, King has worked to build international recognition for the Angola Three. He spoke before the parliaments of the Netherlands, France, Portugal, Indonesia, Brazil and United Kingdom about the case, and about political prisoners in the United States. King was received as a guest and dignitary by the African National Congress in South Africa, and spoke with Desmond Tutu. Amnesty International added Wallace and Woodfox to their watch list of \\"political prisoners\\"/\\"prisoners of conscience.\\" The Angola Three were the subject of two documentaries: Angola 3: Black Panthers and the Last Slave Plantation (2006), produced by Scott Crow and Ann Harkness; and In the Land of the Free (2010), directed by Vadim Jean and narrated by Samuel L. Jackson. The film features Robert King, telephone interviews with Woodfox and Wallace, and interviews with attorneys and others involved with the cases. These include the widow of the late guard Brent Miller, who believes the three men are innocent of her husband's murder. The men were also the subject of a music video produced by Dave Stewart of the Eurythmics in protest of the incarceration of the Angola 3. It features Saul Williams, Nadirah X, Asdru Sierra, Dana Glover, Tina Schlieske, Derrick Ashong and Stewart. The song \\"The Rise of the Black Messiah\\" (2015), written by Amy Ray and performed by Indigo Girls, was inspired by the Angola 3. Herman Wallace was the subject of an ongoing socio- political art project entitled The House That Herman Built. Artist Jackie Sumell asked Wallace what his dream home would be like, and expressed his response in various media. Angad Singh Bhalla made a feature-length documentary, Herman's House (2012), about Sumell's project.

Biography Olsen was born in Ogden, Utah, to Mormon parents Edward Arenholt Olsen and Martha Hoverholst,Western States Marriage Index http://search.ancestry.com/cgi- bin/sse.dll?new=1&gsfn;=Edward+Arenholt&gsln;=Olsen&rank;=1&gss;=angs-g&mswpn;__ftp=Ogden%2c+Weber%2c+Utah%2c+USA&mswpn;=79356&mswpn;_PInfo=8-%7c0%7c1652393%7c0%7c2%7c3249%7c47%7c0%7c3107%7c79356%7c0%7c&sbo;=1&pcat;=ROOT_CATEGORY&h;=982195&recoff;=4+5+6+23&db;=StructuredCrawledSites-17&indiv;=1&ml;_rpos=68 who named him after the Moroni found in the Book of Mormon. Some sources have claimed that Olsen's birth name was John Willard Clawson, but there appears to be no support for this claim. Olsen studied at Weber State Academy, the predecessor of Weber State University. He then went to study at the University of Utah, where one of his teachers was Maud May Babcock. During World War I, he sold war bonds for the United States Navy. He also studied and performed in the Eastern United States around this time. In 1923, Olsen organized the \\"Moroni Olsen Players\\" out of Ogden. They performed at both Ogden's Orpheum Theatre and at various other locations spread from Salt Lake City to Seattle. After having worked on Broadway, he made his film debut in a 1935 adaptation of The Three Musketeers. He later played a different role in a 1939 comedy version of the story, starring Don Ameche as D'Artagnan and the Ritz Brothers as three dimwitted lackeys who are forced to substitute for the musketeers, who have drunk themselves into a stupor. He appeared in scores of films during his career. His most famous role was the voice of the Slave in The Magic Mirror in Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). Olsen provided the voice of the senior angel in It's a Wonderful Life. He also played a Secret Service officer in Alfred Hitchcock's 1946 film, Notorious. Olsen was an active member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, being a teacher of youth in the Hollywood Ward. He also was director of the Pilgrimage Play of Hollywood for several years. Death Olsen died on November 22, 1954, of a heart attack at the age of 65. He is buried in the Ogden City Cemetery.Moroni Olsen (1889-1954) - Find A Grave Memorial Broadway roles * Mary of Scotland (1933) as John Knox Selected filmography *The Three Musketeers (1935) as Porthos *Annie Oakley (1935) as William 'Buffalo Bill' Cody *Seven Keys to Baldpate (1935) as Mayor Jim Cargan *We're Only Human (1935) as Inspector J.R.

It is the most active volcano in the country, occupying a remote portion of central Bougainville Island. It is one of Melanesia's youngest and most active volcanoes. Bagana is a massive symmetrical, roughly 1750-m-high lava cone largely constructed by an accumulation of viscous andesitic lava flows. The entire lava cone could have been constructed in about 300 years at its present rate of lava production. Eruptive activity at Bagana is frequent and is characterized by non-explosive effusion of viscous lava that maintains a small lava dome in the summit crater, although explosive activity occasionally producing pyroclastic flows also occurs. Lava flows form dramatic, freshly preserved tongue-shaped lobes up to 50-m-thick with prominent levees that descend the volcano's flanks on all sides. Just north-east of Bagana is the volcano crater lake Billy Mitchell. Bagana is one of 17 post-Miocene stratovolcanoes on Bougainville. U.S. General Floyd L.

The local director was a college professor, and courses specific to teaching inner city students and disadvantaged students were developed by the college and used in the master's level education program. Teams of interns under the supervision of master teachers worked in the district's schools to help carry out project goals. The purpose of the Teacher Corps was to train and retain teachers for disadvantaged school districts, who would work with the communities they served. Some of the interns became teachers in the communities they had worked in after the program ended. Others took jobs elsewhere teaching disadvantaged students, usually in their home states. Interns worked on community projects in addition to teaching. One of the Trenton, NJ community programs that continued for years after the program ended, was an annual carnival fundraiser to raise money for the Mott Elementary School library. The director of the Trenton Teacher Corps was Dr. Bernard Schwartz of Trenton State University. The Coordinator, who represented the Trenton Public Schools, was Bernice J. Munce. The interns were trained by the following team leaders: Daisy Morgan, Elise Collins, James Lodge, Anna Eure and Catherine Johnson. This program ended in 1970 with 21 interns completing the program. Some of the participants were volunteers coming from Vista and Peace Corps programs, who had taught people and done community outreach, but who lacked formal training in teaching. When the revolution that brought Gaddafi to power in Libya broke out in September, 1969, he accused the Peace Corps volunteers of being CIA agents, and they had to leave the country. Some of these volunteers entered the Teacher Corps. Originally one of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society programs, Teacher Corps, along with more than 40 other programs related to education, was replaced by block grants under the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981.Stein, Sandra J, The Culture of Education Policy, (Teachers College Press, New York, New York, 2004) p. 71 A 1974 study examining 20 Teacher Corps projects that began in 1971 found that half involved elementary school children, half secondary school children.A Study of Teacher Training at Sixth Cycle Teacher Corps Projects , page 54. While many projects involved inner-city schools, others involved children in rural areas like the Flint Hills of Kansas or Indian reservations.Using an Indian Community in Social Studies Education Before its demise, the Corps enlisted local colleges, public schools and poverty organizations to provide training to future teachers to train them in the cultural and social traits of low income, socially disadvantaged persons to enable them to more effectively teach in the inner city elementary schools. The interns and their team leaders participated in and developed community involvement activities in the various neighborhoods where their schools were located. They taught full-time, worked on a master's degree full-time, and did community service work to provide enrichment for the children they taught and to enhance the communities they lived in. They modified their curriculum to eliminate deficits and adjustment problems to school caused by social and educational deprivation. The interns and their team leaders created community outreach programs to get the community involved and to bring more community resources into the schools. The idea of a teachers corps was reestablished as the non-profit organization Teach for America, which receives federal support as an AmeriCorps program. Reestablishing a National Teachers Corps has been suggested by the Democratic Leadership Council.DLC: Idea of the Week: A National Teachers Corps (July 12, 1999) In his 2006 State of the Union address George W.

He graduated from Valparaiso University in 1894, and opened a law practice in Barbourville, Kentucky. He formed a political alliance with future Representatives Caleb Powers and John Robsion, both prominent Republicans in the eastern part of the state. By 1916, he was serving on the Kentucky Court of Appeals (the state's highest court) and had previously served as a county judge and circuit court judge. In 1923, he was elevated to chief justice of the Court of Appeals. He served until 1927, when he became the Republican gubernatorial nominee. The Democrats nominated former governor and senator J. C. W. Beckham to challenge Sampson. The primary issue in the campaign was whether to outlaw parimutuel betting at the state's racetracks. Beckham favored the ban, and Sampson opposed it. A political machine, known as the Jockey Club, backed Sampson, and several key Democrats bolted the party after Beckham's nomination. Sampson won the governorship by over 32,000 votes, but every other Republican on the ticket lost by small majorities. The results suggested that some careful vote fraud had been co-ordinated to ensure Beckham's defeat, but none was ever proved. Sampson's term in office was a tumultuous one. The 1928 legislature was dominated by Democrats and was not particularly responsive to Sampson's proposals. After the session, Sampson was indicted for accepting gifts from textbook companies, but the charges were later dropped. In 1929, Sampson removed Democratic political boss Ben Johnson from his post as highway commissioner. When legislators reconvened in 1930, they retaliated by stripping Sampson of many of his appointment powers and reinstalling Johnson to his post. Later in the session, Sampson proposed to allow Samuel Insull to dam the Cumberland Falls to generate hydroelectric power. The General Assembly instead voted to accept an offer from T. Coleman du Pont to purchase the falls and turn them into a state park. The Assembly voted to restrict further Sampson's powers in 1930. The end of Sampson's term was complicated by the economic realities of the Great Depression. He called out the Kentucky National Guard to quell a violent mine strike in Harlan County, known as the Battle of Evarts. Following his term, Sampson returned to Barbourville and was re-elected as a circuit court judge. He died May 25, 1967 and was buried in Barbourville Cemetery. Early life Flem Sampson was born in a log cabin near London, Kentucky in Laurel County, the ninth of ten children born to Joseph and Emoline (Kellam) Sampson.Finch, p. 42Sexton, p. 160 He was educated in the county's public schools and John T. Hays School.Powell, p. 90 The family moved to Barbourville, Kentucky when Sampson was 13.Johnson, p. 1619 By 16, Sampson was teaching at Indian Creek School in Laurel County. He attended Union College in Barbourville and then enrolled at Valparaiso University. He was class president for three years and earned an A.B. in 1894. Per university policy, he was also awarded and an LL.B. because prior to graduation, he had studied for at least one year in a law office. He returned to Kentucky and was admitted to the bar in June 1895. Sampson established his legal practice in Barbourville, where he became the city attorney.\\"Kentucky Governor Flem Davis Sampson\\" Caleb Powers, who had been Sampson's college roommate, now joined him as a partner in his law firm.Harrison in A New History of Kentucky, p. 356 Powers would later be accused of complicity to the assassination of Governor William Goebel. Because Powers was convicted by a partisan jury, he became a political martyr to many Republicans, and Sampson's connection to him became a boon in heavily Republican eastern Kentucky. Sampson later served as president of Barbourville's First National Bank and was the youngest person ever to hold that position. He also served as president of the Barbourville Water-works Company.Johnson, p. 1618 On September 20, 1897, he married Susie Steele; the couple had three daughters‚ÄîPauline, Emolyn, and Helen Katherine. Early political career Sampson's political career began in 1906 when he was elected county judge of Knox County, Kentucky, a position that he held for four years.Harrison in The Kentucky Encyclopedia, p. 795 In 1911, he was elected to the circuit court of the 34th Judicial District. He was re-elected to this post in 1916, but later that year, he was elected to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which was then the court of last resort in Kentucky. He represented Kentucky's Seventh Appellate District, and he was elevated to chief justice on January 1, 1923. He was re-elected to the court in 1924. Elected governor of Kentucky Sampson and US Representative John M. Robsion organized a formidable Republican faction in the eastern part of Kentucky.Harrison in The Kentucky Encyclopedia, p. 796 In 1927, Sampson was a candidate for the Republican gubernatorial nomination. His opponent was Robert H. Lucas, a tax collector for the Internal Revenue Service. Lucas secured the support of Kentucky Senators Frederic M. Sackett and Richard P. Ernst, and Sampson was backed by longtime supporter John M. Robsion and the Jockey Club, a coalition of leaders who supported parimutuel betting on horse races.Klotter, p. 285 Sampson won the primary by a margin of 39,375.Finch, p. 43 The Democratic Party was badly divided over the parimutuel betting issue as well as Prohibition, and a severance tax on coal. The prohibitionist and anti- gambling faction of the Democratic Party, with the help of Louisville Courier- Journal editor Robert Worth Bingham, united to make former governor and US Senator J. C. W. Beckham the party's gubernatorial nominee.Sexton, p. 161 After Beckham's nomination, many pro-gambling and anti-prohibition Democrats hurried to the support of Sampson. The sitting Democratic governor William J. Fields, who had been elected with help from the Jockey Club, was very passive in the campaign and refused to support Beckham. The campaign was particularly contentious. Sampson contrasted his humble roots with Beckham's aristocratic ones by declaring, \\"I'm just plain old Flem. When I'm elected governor of Kentucky, come into my office and sit down and say 'Howdy Flem'.\\"Klotter, p. 286 He also trumpeted his own moral purity, claiming he \\"never smoked, chewed, drank, gamblednot even bet on an election.\\" He promised, however, to protect horse-racing in the Commonwealth. In response, Sampson's opponents dubbed him \\"Flem-Flam Flem.\\" Sampson won the election by a majority of over 32,000 votes although every other Republican candidate lost by small margins. In the lieutenant governor's race, Democrat James Breathitt, Jr. defeated Sampson's running mate, E. E. Nelson, by 159 votes out of more than 700,000 cast.Klotter, p. 288 It was estimated that the Jockey Club spent half-a- million dollars to defeat Beckham, and the large majority for Sampson versus the close defeat of all other Republican candidates suggested some type of electoral fraud, but none was ever proved. Governor During the 1928 legislative session, it became clear that the bipartisan support shown for Sampson had been one of political convenience rather than true conviction. Among the minor accomplishments of the session were the creation of the Kentucky Progress Commission, the forerunner of the State Department of Commerce, as well as the adoption of \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\" as the state song.Klotter, p. 289 The Democratic General Assembly sanctioned Sampson's plan for free textbooks but did not fund it. Proposals to ban parimutuel betting and the teaching of evolution in the state's schools were both defeated. Kentucky historian James C. Klotter called the 1928 legislative session \\"almost a 'do-nothing' session.\\" Following the session, a grand jury indicted Sampson for accepting gifts from the textbook companies, but the indictment was eventually dismissed. Ben Johnson was head of the state Highway Department when Sampson took office The first major controversy of Sampson's administration was over the selection of the state's highway commissioner. The Highway Department employed over 10,000 people and spent nearly 45% of the state's budget. Legislators' votes could often be bought with promises of new roads for their districts. Thus, the department became a primary vehicle for dispensing patronage to political supporters.Klotter, p. 290 Sampson's predecessor, Governor Fields, had chosen a retired US representative and Democratic political boss, Ben Johnson, to head the department, and Sampson had agreed to retain him in exchange for his support against Beckham. However, Sampson felt that such a powerful position could not be left in the hands of a Democrat, and he removed Johnson from office in December 1929.Harrison in A New History of Kentucky, p. 357 Democrats in the General Assembly were outraged. When the 1930 legislative session convened, they immediately passed a bill that stripped Sampson of his power to appoint a highway commissioner, giving it to a three-person commission, composed of the governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general. The Republican Sampson would then be outnumbered and outvoted. Confident that the Democrats would not lose another gubernatorial election, Democratic legislators stipulated in the bill that the appointment power would return to the governor in 1931, which was the end of Sampson's term. The law passed the House of Representatives 53‚Äî42 and the Senate 22‚Äî15. Sampson vetoed the bill, but the veto was overridden, and Johnson was returned to his former position.Klotter, pp. 290-291 Sampson also made enemies when he backed Samuel Insull's plan to dam the Cumberland Falls to generate hydroelectric power. An ally of the traditional southern power groups (the utility companies and textbook manufacturers), Sampson cited the jobs to be gained from the plan. The plan was opposed conservationists in the state and by most of the state's newspapers. An alternate plan was proposed by Louisville-born millionaire and Delaware Senator T. Coleman du Pont, who offered to purchase the falls for $230,000 and turn it into a state park.Sexton, p. 162 The General Assembly passed legislation giving the state park commission the right of eminent domain over the falls and then voted to accept the du Pont's offer.Klotter, p. 292 Sampson vetoed the Assembly's action, but his veto was overridden. Sampson's agenda for the 1930 session was lost in the fights over Ben Johnson and Cumberland Falls. His calls for funding the free textbook program, compulsory sterilization of the mentally ill, and restrictions on chain stores were ignored. Instead, the legislature further eroded his gubernatorial powers, including the power to appoint members of the textbook commission. With nearly all of the governor's powers stripped away and given to a three-person commission, Lieutenant Governor James Breathitt, Jr. became the de facto governor for the remainder of Sampson's term. The General Assembly pursued its own agenda, passing a mandatory driver's license law, a revised election law, and a sales tax on retail stores. It also allocated funding for the purchase of what would become Mammoth Cave National Park. Sampson vetoed 12 bills during the 1930 session, but the legislature overrode 11 of them. With the onset of the Great Depression, Sampson worked to control government costs, but he endorsed highway progression. A severe drought in 1930 left 86 of the state's counties applying for federal aid. As unemployment in the eastern coal fields climbed to 40 percent, the United Mine Workers made their first inroads in the region. In 1931, mine owners began firing workers who joined the union.Bush, p. 161 Many of those workers gathered in Evarts, Kentucky. The local sheriff added 26 deputies to his staff, helping to enforce the blacklisting of those miners and to discourage further organization. Union leaders petitioned Sampson to remove the sheriff and the county judge from office.Bush, p. 162 Violent squabbles between striking union miners and local authorities began as early as mid- April 1931.Bush, p. 164 On May 5, 1931, three guards and a miner were killed in a shootout that became known as the Battle of Evarts. Two days later, Sampson called in the Kentucky National Guard to disarm both the mine guards and the union miners.Bush, p. 165 All of the union's leaders were arrested, and the strike ultimately failed. Later life Following his term as governor, Sampson returned to his legal practice in Barbourville and was elected as a circuit court judge.\\"Sampson Fails to Come Back\\" In 1940, he once again sought election to the Kentucky Court of Appeals but was defeated in the Republican primary by Eugene Siler. In 1957, he was appointed to the Citizens' Advisory Highway Committee, and was awarded the Governor's Medallion for distinguished public service in 1959. At the age of 91, Sampson served on the State Constitutional Revision Committee. He died in Pewee Valley, Kentucky on May 25, 1967, and was buried at the Barbourville Cemetery.

Instead of anonymizing the network, the data blocks are anonymized and therefore, only data garbage is ever exchanged and stored and no forwarding via intermediate nodes is required. OFF claims to have been created with the expressed intention \\"to cut off some gangrene- infested bits of the copyright industry.\\"OFF System History OFF development started within the hacktivism group The Big Hack in 2003 by the hackers Cheater512, CaptainMorgan, Aqlo and WhiteRaven. In 2004, a rudimentary version was finished, written in PHP, which was distributed as two demo CDs. Following these, SpectralMorning re-implemented the functionality in 2004 in C++, which led to the current \\"mainline\\" OFF client. On August 14, 2006, CaptainMorgan posted a letter of \\"closing\\" addressed to the \\"Copyright Industry Associations of America\\", such as the RIAA and MPAA, stating that they have created OFF with the purpose of ending \\"all of your problems with consumer copyright infringement.\\" \\"Closing Letter to the Copyright Industry Associations of America\\" - presenting the public release of the OFF System In 2008, the network consisted of around 50 nodes. On April 11, 2008, a beta test was heldhttp://board.planetpeer.de/index.php/topic,4407.0.html Beta test announcement for 2008-04-11 of planetpeer.de and OFF developer Spectral Morning with a network size of over 100 nodes. Since SpectralMorning stopped work on OFF in late 2008, only minor bug fix releases were made to mainline OFF. Starting from 2007, an alternative, but compatible client was developed, called BlocksNet. Written in Ruby and well-maintained, it saw major improvements over recent time. It has been under development until 2011.http://blocksnet.sf.net The client OFFLoad is a fork from mainline OFF, which seemingly adds no features. Reasons for the fork are unclear. Another distantly related program is Monolith, which uses a similar principle to OFF. It was created after OFF and features no multi-use of blocks and no networking. Functional Principle The OFF System is a kind of anonymous, fully decentralized P2P file sharing program and network. In contrast to other anonymous file sharing networks, which derive their anonymity from forwarding their data blocks via intermediate network nodes, OFF derives its anonymity from anonymizing the data files.http://sourceforge.net/projects/offsystem/ OFF System homepage - technical part Thus, the system refers to itself as a brightnet to contrast its method of operation with that of private file sharing systems known as darknets and with traditional, forwarding anonymous P2P programs. Store Procedure In order to store a file into the local OFF storage, resp. block cache, choose the tuple size t (default 3), split the source file s into blocks s_i of size 128 KiB (pad with random data to fit) and for each, do the following: # Select t-1 blocks for use as randomizer blocks, or for short, randomizers, from the existing OFF cache, which have not been used in previous iterations. If not enough randomizers exist in the cache, generate them using a random number generator. # Calculate o_i = s_i \\\\oplus r_1 \\\\oplus r_2 \\\\oplus ... \\\\oplus r_{t-1} and store the resulting block o_i in the cache, \\\\oplus being the XOR operation. # Update the descriptor list, which contains the information on how to restore each source block s_i, with a new entry, which is a set of size t: \\\\\\\\{o_i, r_1, r_2 ... r_{t-1}\\\\\\\\}. Finally, store the descriptor list in its own block (or blocks, if the list is larger than 128 KiB) and insert these blocks d_i into the block cache and generate an OFF URL for referencing the source file and output it to the user or into the local OFF URL database. Retrieve Procedure To retrieve, obtain the descriptor block or blocks and for each contained set of size t, do the following: # Obtain the listed blocks b_1, b_2 ... b_t. Though they have no identity any more at this point, they could be called o_i, r_1, r_2 ... r_{t-1}. # Perform s_i = b_1 \\\\oplus b_2 \\\\oplus ... \\\\oplus b_t and output the resulting source data block s_i to a viewer program or to storage. Anonymity OFF derives its anonymity from the following: # No source file content is stored in the block cache, only blocks that consist of probably random data. # No source file content is searched for on the network. # No source file content is transmitted over the network. # (No block in the cache is copyrightable by itself, because numbers - however large - cannot be subject to copyright (and neither would be small parts of a copyrighted work).) # The original uploader remains unknown, because blocks are dispersed into the network and therefore downloading is done from multiple sources. # During disperse, the usage of the block cannot be stated, because blocks are re-used in other contexts to re-assemble other source file blocks. (TODO that is true also for retrieve) # (No block can be copyrighted without logical contradictions, because blocks used for re-assembling a source file block are re-used for re-assembly of other source file blocks. It is undecidable who would have copyright on a block, which has several meanings. Everyone would have copyright on everything.) # If the OFF-internal search function is used, search terms are untraceable to its originator, because the search request is forwarded to the next node and its results back to that node instead of directly to the originator. It is thus not possible to decide whether a node is the originating node or a node doing a search request on behalf of another node. # TODO add digital copyright note Efficiency Because OFF anonymizes the data blocks being exchanged instead of the network, no forwarding via intermediate nodes is required. Therefore, this method has a higher degree of efficiency than traditional, forwarding-based anonymous P2P systems. The forwarding method requires that a data block is uploaded and downloaded several times before it reaches its destination, which happens between 5 and 15 times.,http://www.i2p2.de/how_tunnelrouting Explanation of tunnel length in I2P and its default settings, see \\"I2CP options\\" which, according to the resulting formula s * (hi + ho + 1) * 2 - s, is equivalent to an overhead of 900 to 2900%, while the overhead of OFF without optimizations is about 200%. (s is the source file size, hi the inbound tunnel length and ho the outbound tunnel length. Plus 1 for the hop between the Outbound Endpoint and the Inbound Gateway.) Efficiency can be further increased: #Re-use some of the result blocks o_i and randomizer blocks, which reduces the overhead to s * (t-1) * \\\\frac {e}{100},http://sourceforge.net/projects/offsystem/ OFF System source code and developer correspondence where s is the source file size, t the tuple size and e the percentage of unrelated blocks used in the randomizing step during the store procedure. By default, e is chosen 75 (and t chosen 3), which leads to an overhead of 150%. #If some of the blocks required to fully retrieve, resp. re-assemble, the source file are already present in the block cache from other transfers or stored files because of the multi-use nature of OFF blocks, the degree of efficiency is increased further. #Use of the targeted store feature leads to the blocks of specific other files to be chosen as randomizers for this file with higher probability and therefore a reduction in overhead. This is especially useful when storing a group of related files.

Pemmasani Kings helped Aravidu dynasty Kings in battles with Muslim kings to protect Hindu religion in South India. They belonged to the Kamma social group. Sources Pemmasani Nayaks are known to be the feudatory rulers of Gandikota in the sixteenth century, serving under Aravidu dynasty (1542‚Äì1652), especially Aliya Rama Raya. The late sixteenth century Telugu text Rayavachakamu mentions Pemmasani Ramalinga Nayudu as a Kamma chief serving Krishnadeva Raya (). It is not known whether he served Krishnadeva Raya or some later ruler.: Pemmasani Ramalingama Nayadu [mentioned in the text] belonged to the influential Pemmasani family that ruled the Gandikota- sima during the second half of the sixteenth century and provided several prominent ministers, including Pemmasani Timma, who served Vijayanagara under the Aravidu dynasty... It is not clear whether he served Krishnadevaraya or a later ruler.  Extent of rule  The Pemmasani Nayaks ruled Yadiki, Gutti and Tadipatri with Gandikota as capital. The maximum extent of Pemmasanis feudatorial influence ranged from Gandikota to Kondapalli during the reign of Pemmasani Ramalinga Nayaka which includes areas like Gutti, Kurnool fort, Kondaveedu, Bellamkonda, Raichur, Kanchi, Tadipatri, Yadaki.\\"Aristocracy of South India\\" by Vadivelu They ruled from Gandikota as their capital. Pemmasanis ruled mostly as autonomous rulers of Gandikota. Pemmasanis helped Araveeti kings to ascend the throne of great Vijayanagar Empire when there was power shift between Tuluva and Araveedu dynasties after the Battle of Tallikota in 1565 A. D. where the Vijayanagar empire under Tuluva dynasty rule faced huge defeat against combined forces of Deccan Sultanates. Pemmasanis played a crucial role in protecting the Vijayanagar empire. This is evident from the prime location of land that Vijayanagar kings have provided to Pemmasanis in Hampi as camp when they visited the city.

Rule The first ruler of Pemmasani clan was Pemmasani Timmanayudu who fought many a battle and won the trust of Bukka Raya. Veera Thimma had a son by name Chennappa who had two sons Ramalinga Naidu and Peda Thimma Naidu. Ramalinga ruled Gandikota (1509-1530 CE) during the time of Krishna Deva Raya. Ramalinga had 80,000 soldiers under him and he played a crucial role in the victory of Krishna Deva Raya over the combined armies of Kalaburagi, Golkonda and Ahmednagar.Krishnadeva Raya, M. Rama Rao, 1971, National Book Trust, New Delhi, p. 17 His exploits in the battle were extolled by many Telugu poets. He was the most feared by the Generals of Bijapur, Ahmednagar and Golconda. Thimma Naidu II participated in the expeditions of Krishna Deva Raya and captured Udayagiri, Addanki, Kondapalli, Rajahmundry and Katakam (Cuttack). He also played a crucial role in the conquest of Ummattur. After the death of Krishna Deva Raya in 1529, his son-in-law Rama Raya took control of the kingdom. The Bahamani sultan colluded with Salakam Timmaraja and raided Vijayanagar. Ramaraya took refuge in Gandikota. Bangaru Thimma Naidu vanquished Bahamanis in a fierce battle at Komali, killed Salakam Timmaraja and restored the throne to Ramaraya.Further Sources of Vijayanagar History by K. A.

The council was thus a reunion of the whole church of Spain (of both Hispania and Gallia). Its primary purpose was to reaffirm the decrees of the Fifth Council of 636 and to restore internal peace. Four of the nineteen canons of the council were specifically political, the rest covered Jews, monks, penitents, freedmen, holy orders, benefices, and ecclesiastical property. The council affirmed the Fifth Council's decrees about the security of the king and his family. It also excommunicated those who fled overseas and there plotted against the king or otherwise endangered him. Anathema was pronounced on all who attacked the king or conspired to overthrow him and usurp his throne. A successor to an assassinated king was dishonoured if he did not punish the regicides. The council confirmed the permanent possession of property given to the church by anyone and laid down punishments for simony.

Garbarnia Krak√≥w is a Polish football and sports club from Ludwin√≥w ‚Äì a historical district of the city of Krak√≥w. The club's name comes from the nearby tannery () of the D≈Çu≈ºy≈Ñski brothers, which was the original club sponsor. Garbarnia currently plays in II liga (3rd tier of Polish football).  History  Founded in 1921, Garbarnia's best years were the late 1920s and early 1930s. In 1928, after winning both regional and national qualifiers, the team was promoted to the Polish Football League. Then, in 1929, after an excellent campaign, they finished second to champions Warta Poznan, thus cementing their position as one of the top teams in Poland. In 1931 Garbarnia went one better, becoming Polish Champions. Containing little home-grown talent, the Krak√≥w starting lineup consisted of players brought in from other clubs. Among the top players were Otto Riesner and Karol Pazurek (both the natives of Katowice), and both of whom played for the Polish national team. In 1937, after 9 years in the top division, Garbarnia were relegated. They returned in 1939, in a season cut short by the outbreak of World War II. After the Second World War Garbarnia never regained its status, playing mainly in the Polish Second Division, occasionally managing to win promotion to the First Division, only to be relegated after a year or two. 1957 was the team's final year in the First Division and since then, Garbarnia have never made it back. Worst was yet to come, as in 1971 the team was relegated to the Third division, the Regional Krak√≥w district league. In 2018, Garbarnia returned to Polish First League (2nd tier) after a 44-year absence. Garbarnia secured promotion after promotion/relegation play-off win over Pogo≈Ñ Siedlce.

He then had an idea for a series, bought a video camera, and went to the jungles of Colombia, where he made a pilot which he sold to the National Geographic Channel, which employed him in 1998 as its 'Adventurer in Residence' and he spent five years as a producer and presenter. For National Geographic International, Backshall presented the expedition series Game For It and the environmental series EarthPulse. On A Walk in The Desert he walked across Israel's Negev Desert For Bootcamp, he completed the Israeli special forces selection course, running 60 miles overnight to gain their red beret.

He competed with fellow naturalist Nick Baker in a series of wildlife challenges, with long-standing host Michaela Strachan. After four years, The Really Wild Show was axed so he joined the BBC Natural History Unit's expedition team. In Expedition Borneo, BBC 2005, the team went in search of new species. With other cavers he made the first exploration of the passages below the mighty 'Solo' sinkhole in the Mulu mountains of Borneo, and also made the first ascent of the north side of Mount Kuli. He co-presented Springwatch Trackers (BBC Two) with Kirsten O'Brien which was broadcast live from the Springwatch farm in Devon between 28 May and 15 June 2007. Teams of boys and girls were set a series of Tracker challenges. In 2008 Backshall's Deadly 60 was commissioned, followed by the Live n Deadly offshoot, the aim of which was to inspire children to get outside and interested in wildlife and adventure; his live wildlife question and answer appearances attracted up to 14,000 people per event. In the \\"Deadly\\" programmes he searched for predators that were \\"Not just deadly to me, but deadly in their own world\\". He dived outside of the cage with great white, bull, great hammerhead, mako and tiger sharks, caught king cobras, black mambas and lanceheads, had a redback spider crawl across his hand and was bitten on the leg by a caiman whilst searching for anaconda in an Argentinian swamp. The programmes were transmitted on Nat Geo Wild, Animal Planet and BBC to 157 countries worldwide. The fourth season of the series, Deadly Pole to Pole was filmed in 2013‚Äì2014 from the Arctic circle to Antarctica, journeying south through the Americas. The scenarios included being hunted by a polar bear whilst kayaking in Svalbard, filming feeding sharks and eagles using timeslice technology, exploring flooded caves and the insides of a glacier, and catching dozens of species of snake and crocodile.

In Episode 1 Backshall and his team tackle Amaurai Tepui in south Venezuela's Canaima National Park. The expedition nearly ended in tragedy, when a storm hit the mountain, and rockfall nearly hit his climbing partner Aldo Kane. In 2017 the BBC premiered another two-part documentary following Backshall's expedition to New Guinea called Down the Mighty River with Steve Backshall. The team of whitewater kayakers attempted to make the first ever descent of the 500mile long Baliem River in West Papua; an expedition Backshall had been planning since 1997. Over the course of six weeks, they battled against some of the hardest whitewater on earth, capsizes, illness and local politics. Eventually they made it from source to sea, although were open that they had not kayaked the entire length of the journey.

This involved ten expeditions to parts of the globe that had never been explored before. The team uncovered many miles of sunken cave passages in the cenotes of the Yucatan. They made the first descents of rivers in Suriname and discovered a waterfall that had no record of ever being seen before. At over 100m high, it was the second highest in the nation. In Bhutan on the first descent of the Chamkhar Chhu river, Backshall was caught in a rapid for five minutes and nearly drowned. His life was saved by rescue kayaker Sal Montgomery.

Eli Sanders, tipple worker, loads coal on car which has fallen off cars en route to tipple. Children walking their way through the town of Evarts The Battle of Evarts (May 5, 1931) occurred in Harlan, Kentucky during the Harlan County Wars. The coal miners desired improved working conditions, higher wages, and more housing options for their families. These reasons, along with other factors, led the miners to go on strike. It ended when the Kentucky National Guard was called in to break it up. This battle lasted approximately 15 minutes.  Opposing Forces  Numerous forces and factors were involved in the so-called battle. Opposing the miners were the heavily armed private \\"police\\" ordered by the company to break up the strike, while other associations chose not to become involved. The United Mine Workers of America, or UMWA, considered helping the miners, but once it realized the amount of resources required decided not to offer its support. The Red Cross also decided not offer any support, saying the strike was an \\"Industrial dispute\\" which did not involve them. The Black Mountain Coal Company's hired gunmen were eager to fight, and they were the ones responsible for the deaths that followed.  Battle  The 'Battle of Evarts' began on the morning of May 5, 1931. The company had ordered a motorcade to drive to Harlan to deliver goods to the 'Scabs\\" there (the non-union miners who had been hired to replace those on strike). The motorcade consisted of just three cars, with a sheriff's deputy in each one. The deputies expected violence, and they got it. The striking miners waited for the motorcade near the Evarts railroad, and as the motorcade approached them, a single shot rang out. No one knows who fired it, but each side blamed the other. The motorcade halted, and deputy Jim Daniels jumped out and hid behind a rock. Daniels was one of the most hated anti-union deputies in the county. Daniels raised his head to fire at the miners, but as soon as he did so, he was fatally shot and killed. The exchange of gunfire lasted for fifteen minutes, with an estimated 1,000 shots being fired. When it ended, the three deputies and one miner lay dead.http://www.kentuckymonthly.com/culture/history/the-price-of-coal/  Causes  Since this happened during the Harlan County Wars, other skirmishes had led up to the several months of turmoil. The factors that led to the Battle of Evarts included mine conditions, pay, and independence from the coal company as well as hunger, desperation, and intrigue. Miners were being laid off for attending United Mine Workers meetings.https://wp.nyu.edu/specialcollections/2013/05/07/hell-in-harlan/ Also, the Black Mountain Coal Company created a grocery store where the miners would be able to spend the money that they earned there. Miners didn't like this because they were not allowed to spend their money elsewhere and If the miners were caught spending their money at somewhere else they would be fired and kicked out of town.https://www.theclio.com/web/entry?id=12137 The final straw was when the Harlan County Coal Operators Association cut miners' wages by 10%. After this, the first strike occurred, in which only about 13% of strikers showed up to work. Out of all these battles, the Battle of Evarts was one of the most violent. It left four dead and had to have the Kentucky National Guard called in for protection. After months of rallies, on June 17, all mine workers reported back to their jobs.  Aftermath  The aftermath of this battle led to wider strikes in the Harlan County area. Coal companies refused to back down while the Red Cross refused to give aid due to a policy of staying neutral during disputes. After about a month and a half of strikes, workers reported back on June 17 because of unresponsive negotiation-partners and starvation due to having no money to spend on food. Eight miners ended up receiving life in jail for conspiracy to murder for the actions that took place on May 5. The Battle of Evarts may have only been 15 minutes long with only four deaths, but it is a huge piece of history when it comes to the Coal Wars.

Their first match as a forward trio resulted in a 6‚Äì1 victory over East Fife. The Terrible Trio continued to score freely in the following 5 seasons, Conn notching 102 goals. Hearts became regular top four finishers yet defensive inconsistency ensured they failed to collect any silverware. Conn eventually won his first medal in the 1954‚Äì55 season, when Hearts defeated Motherwell 4‚Äì2 in the 1954 Scottish League Cup Final. The following season, Conn scored as Hearts defeated Celtic 3‚Äì1 in the 1956 Scottish Cup Final, their first triumph in that competition for 50 years.

Origin Transnational Corporation of Nigeria plc was incorporated on November 16, 2004. The original concept was that Transcorp would be a conglomerate, similar to the South Korean Chaebols. Transcorp's Businesses *Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja ‚Äì a 670-room 4-star hotel. *Transcorp Hotels, Calabar ‚Äì a 146-room destination hotel located in the city of Calabar, Cross River State, Nigeria. *Teragro Commodities Limited ‚Äì the agribusiness subsidiary, operator of the Teragro Benfruit Plant, Benue State, Nigeria.

TUPL has made full payment of $300million for the plant. Acquisitions *The Hilton, Hotel, Abuja: In December, 2005, Transcorp acquired 51% controlling stake in the Hilton Abuja for the sum of $105 million (equivalent at the time to N13.7billion) after a very competitive bid. The remaining 49% is owned by the Bureau of Public Enterprise (BPE). *Rumens Road: Transcorp also acquired Rumens Road Apartments at 1 Rumens Road, Ikoyi, Lagos in 2005 for N377m. *Oil Blocs: Transcorp acquired two oil blocs in the May 2006 bidding round, consolidated in one oil bloc, OPL 281 . Ownership of the OPL 281 oil bloc, which had previously been revoked by the Department of Petroleum Resources, was returned to Transcorp in February 2011 after the payment of the balance of the signature bonus . Transcorp is partnering with Equity Energy Resources (EER), and pan-African energy company SAC-Oil Holdings of South Africa, to take equity and provide resources that will bring the oil bloc into operation. *Metropolitan Hotel, Calabar: Transcorp acquired the 146-room Metropolitan Hotel in Calabar (now re-branded Transcorp Hotels Calabar) in June 2010. *Benfruits Plant: On November 29, 2010, Transcorp signed a lease agreement with the Benue State Government for the Benfruits juice concentrate plant in Markurdi, Benue State.http://lagosbusinessnews.com/node/388 *Ughelli Power Plant: On September 25, 2012, Transcorp Ughelli Power Limited (TUPL) (which comprises Wood Rock Energy Resources Limited, Symbion power LLC, Thomassen Holding Limited, Medea Development S.A., Tenoil Petroleum and Energy Services Limited and PSL Engineering and Control Limited) won the $300m bid for the acquisition of the Ughelli Power Plant, one of the six power generation companies of the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) being privatised by the Federal Government of Nigeria. The Ughelli plant is a thermal power generating plant located in Delta State, Nigeria with installed capacity of 1000MW but currently producing 330MW which accounts for 8% of Nigeria's total power generation. On February 21, 2013, Transcorp representatives attended the official signing ceremony at the Presidential Villa in Abuja, Nigeria for the winning bidders of the privatisation of the PHCN. The ceremony was presided over by the Nigerian Minister of Power, Professor Chinedu Nebo and hosted by the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE). TUPL met the 25 percent deposit deadline by paying the sum of US$75million to the BPE on March 20, 2013 and on August 21, 2013, TUPL made payment to the BPE of $225million, representing 75 percent of the $300million bid price for the 1000 megawatt capacity Ughelli Power Plant. On November 1, 2013, the Federal Government of Nigeria officially handed over the plant to Transcorp Ughelli Power Limited.

Etymology The name \\"Hloubƒõt√≠n\\" derives from the surname Hl√∫pata, and was previously known as Lupatin, Glupetin, Hlupetin and Hloupƒõt√≠n before becoming Hloubƒõt√≠n in 1907. Geography The area lies on the Rokytka river, and its northern reaches back onto the area of Kbely Airport. To the west of Hloubƒõt√≠n lies Ho≈ôej≈°√≠ rybn√≠k, a protected area centered on a lake. Transport Hloubƒõt√≠n is located close to the D11 and R10 roads, and Praha- Kyje railway station on the main corridor linking Prague and Pardubice. It is served by Hloubƒõt√≠n metro station on Line B of the Prague Metro, which opened in 1990. It is also an important hub on the Prague tram system.

Wach was descended on both sides from the famous Mendelssohn family, both the philosopher Moses Mendelssohn and the composer Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy. He shared the latter's love of music and was said to have inherited some important papers and relics of his ancestor. After schooling in Dresden, he enlisted in the German army in 1916, where he served as a cavalry officer. After World War I, he studied at the Universities of Munich, Berlin, Freiburg, and Leipzig, where he received his PhD in 1922. He taught at Leipzig University. His Habilitationsschrift, entitled Religionswissenschaft, is widely considered a landmark document in the field of the history of religions. Though Wach's family had long since converted from Judaism to Christianity, he was nonetheless driven out of his teaching post by the Nazis in the early 1930s. He was able to emigrate to the United States, where he took up a post at Brown University, first as Visiting Professor of Biblical Literature (1935‚Äì1939) and then as associate professor (1939‚Äì1946). Raised as a Lutheran, he became an Episcopalian shortly after coming to the United States. He was granted United States citizenship in 1946. Wach taught at the University of Chicago Divinity School from 1945 to 1955, becoming the chair of the History of Religions area, which had just been moved to the Divinity School from its earlier home in the Division of the Humanities. In his lectures and his writings, he emphasized a comprehensive study of religion, focusing on a) religious experience, b) religious praxis, and c) religious communities. According to the University of Chicago Archives, Wach used the methods of the social sciences to better understand religious thought. Developing the field known as the Sociology of Religion, he maintained that the founder of a new religion experienced a revelation illuminating the way the world worked. He then began to acquire disciples who became a closely knit circle directed towards the founder with whom they each had intimate contact. The solidarity of this relationship bound the disciples together and differentiated them from other forms of social organization. Membership in the group required a break with past life and its everyday pursuits in order to focus on the new knowledge to the extent that ties of family and kinship would be relaxed or severed. Wach died unexpectedly of a heart attack (though he had had a history of heart trouble) on August 27, 1955, in Locarno, Switzerland.

Tanner), Harry Greenbank (lyrics) and Sidney Jones (music). It opened at Prince of Wales Theatre in London, produced by George Edwardes, on 14 October 1893 (later transferring to Daly's Theatre) and ran for 413 performances. The show starred C. Hayden Coffin, Louie Pounds, Decima Moore, Eric Lewis, W. Louis Bradfield, and later Rutland Barrington, Scott Russell, Huntley Wright, Marie Studholme and George Grossmith, Jr. Topsy Sinden and later Letty Lind danced in the piece. Choreography was by Willie Warde. Percy Anderson designed the Japanese costumes for the musical, while the non-Japanese costumes were supplied by leading fashion houses.\\"Gaiety Girls in The Geisha\\". Victoria and Albert Museum, accessed 4 August 2011 Blanche Massey was one of the Gaiety Girls in the piece. It also had a successful three-month Broadway run in 1894, followed by an American tour and a world tour. Importance in the development of the modern musical A Gaiety Girl followed Tanner's and Edwardes's success with In Town (1892), and would lead to a series of musicals produced by Edwardes that would pack the Gaiety Theatre for decades. Although the earliest of these shows have the same sound one expects from Gilbert and Sullivan's operas, Edwardes called them \\"musical comedies\\", leading some writers to incorrectly credit him with inventing a form that Harrigan & Hart had established on Broadway a decade earlier. Although Edwardes was not the true inventor of musical comedy, he was the first to elevate these works to international popularity. According to musical theatre writer Andrew Lamb, \\"The British Empire and America began to fall for the appeal of the British musical comedy from the time when A Gaiety Girl was taken on a world tour in 1894.\\"Lamb, Andrew. \\"From Pinafore to Porter: United States-United Kingdom Interactions in Musical Theater, 1879‚Äì1929\\", American Music, Vol. 4, No. 1, British-American Musical Interactions (Spring, 1986), pp. 34-49, University of Illinois Press, retrieved September 18, 2008 The plot of A Gaiety Girl is a simple intrigue about a stolen comb and includes a few tangled romances. Hall's satirical book includes lines which jab at society conventions in the style of an upmarket gossip columnist. The smart society back-chat irritated several people in high places in London who wrote to Edwardes asking for alterations. The public, on the other hand, loved it, even when the Reverend Brierly, a character depicted as a man of doubtful moral rectitude, was demoted, after pressure from Lambeth Palace, to being just plain Dr. Brierly. Satire is also directed, among other things, at the army, and the story ridicules a judge of the divorce court, which caused some controversy.\\"Prince of Wales's Theatre\\", The Times, 16 October 1893, p. 14 A Gaiety Girl's success confirmed Edwardes on the path he was taking. He immediately set Hall, Jones and Greenbank to work on their next show, An Artist's Model. A Gaiety Girl led to some fourteen copies (including The Shop Girl, The Circus Girl, and A Runaway Girl), which were very successful in England for the next two decades, and were widely imitated by other producers and playwriting teams. The Gaiety Girls Stage Door Johnnies waiting after A Gaiety Girl The show's popularity depended, in part, on the beautiful \\"Gaiety Girls\\" dancing chorus appearing onstage in bathing attire and in the latest fashions. According to The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, \\"The piece is a mixture of pretty girls, English humor, singing, dancing and bathing machines and dresses of the English fashion. The dancing is a special feature of the performance, English burlesques giving much more attention to that feature of their attractiveness than the American entertainments of the same grade do.\\"The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, 23 December 1894, p. 9a The 1890s Gaiety Girls were polite, well-behaved young women, respectable and elegant, unlike the corseted actresses from the earlier burlesques. They became a popular attraction and a symbol of ideal womanhood. Many of the best-known London couturiers designed costumes for stage productions by the 1890s, particularly for the Gaiety Girls. The illustrated periodicals were eager to publish photographs of the actresses in the latest stage hits, and so the theatre became an excellent way for clothiers to publicise their latest fashions. The young ladies appearing in George Edwardes's shows became so popular that wealthy gentlemen, termed \\"Stage Door Johnnies\\", would wait outside the stage door hoping to escort them to dinner. In some cases, a marriage into society and even the nobility resulted. Alan Hyman, an expert on burlesque theatre who penned the 1972 book The Gaiety Years, wrote: :\\"...the chorus was becoming a matrimonial agency for girls with ambitions to marry into the peerage and began in the nineties when Connie Gilchrist, a star of the Old Gaiety, married the 7th Earl of Orkney and then in 1901, the 4th Marquess of Headfort married Rosie Boote, who had charmed London the previous year when she sang Maisie in The Messenger Boy. After Connie Gilchrist and Rosie Boote had started the fashion a score of the Guv'nor's budding stars left him to marry peers or men of title while other Gaiety Girls settled for a banker or a stockbroker....\\"Information about the stagedoor Johnnie marriages Roles and original London cast Theatre programme from 1894 Decima Moore as Rose *Sir Lewis Gray (a judge) - Eric Lewis (later replaced by Rutland Barrington) ;Officers in the Life Guards :Charles Goldfield - C.

She is best known as an author of books and articles about sailboat voyaging, living on a small amount of money, and sailing junk rigs. Biography Annie Hill was born in Liverpool, England, United Kingdom, Europe. Hill has been voyaging and living aboard various sailing yachts since 1975. Her book Voyaging on a Small Income is a study in the economics of continual travel and self-sufficiency. Hill writes using distinct British vernacular and colloquialisms. Hill's first two books concerned voyaging aboard Badger, a double-ended dory with a two-masted junk rig of the schooner style, which was built by Annie and her first husband, Pete Hill. Badger was designed by Jay Benford for plywood construction. Annie's analysis and comparison of the modern junk rig is at least partly responsible for the recent re-popularization of the junk rig. Annie Hill continued her sailing aboard Iron Bark, a steel gaff cutter. She and Pete divorced in 2001. She now travels with her second husband, Trevor Robertson. In 2004 and 2005, they spent the winter on Iron Bark frozen in a remote bay in Greenland. She is now based in New Zealand, where she lives aboard a fibreglass boat, Fantail, which she converted to a junk rig in 2011. Annie has covered more than under sail.

Function Hephaestin is involved in the metabolism and homeostasis of iron and possibly copper. It is a transmembrane copper- dependent ferroxidase responsible for transporting dietary iron from intestinal enterocytes into the circulatory system. The highest expression of hephaestin is found in small intestine. It is limited to enterocytes of the villi (where the iron absorption takes place), being almost absent in crypt cells. Hephaestin converts iron(II) state, Fe2+, to iron(III) state, Fe3+, and mediates iron efflux most likely in cooperation with the basolateral iron transporter, ferroportin 1. To a lesser extent hephaestin has been detected in colon, spleen, kidney, breast, placenta and bone trabecular cells but its role in these tissues remains to be established. Hephaestin presents homology with ceruloplasmin, a serum dehydrogenase protein involved in copper detoxification and storage. Hephaestin is a protein of 1135 aminoacids formed from a precursor of 1158 aminoacids and is 130.4 kDa. It is predicted to bind 6 copper ions per monomer. Discovery Hephaestin was first identified by Dr. Christopher D. Vulpe of the University of California, Berkeley in 1999. They named the newfound protein after Hephaestus, the Greek god of metal working. Much of what is known about hephaestin comes from studying heritable mutants of murine iron metabolism. The protein was discovered and identified through the study of mice with sex-linked anemia, or sla mice, in which there is normal mucosal uptake of dietary iron but impaired transport of iron from the intestinal enterocytes into the circulation. sla mice harbor a partial deletion mutation of the HEPH gene, resulting in the expression of a hephaestin protein that is truncated by 194 amino acids. Studies suggest that this truncated hephaestin protein still retains a minimal, yet detectable and quantifiable level of ferroxidase activity. This raises the possibility that alternative factors may contribute to the decreased efflux of iron seen in the sla phenotype. In addition to the truncation of the original protein, the iron-deficient sla phenotype may also be explained by the intracellular mislocalization of hephaestin. Wild type hephaestin localizes in a supra nuclear compartment as well as the basolateral surface. In contrast, sla hephaestin seems to localize only in the supranucelar compartment but is largely undetectable in the latter. Given hephaestin's established function in facilitating basolateral iron export, this mislocalization may explain the paradoxical intestinal iron accumulation and systemic iron deficiency observed in sla mice. Human hephaestin, lacking the putative transmembrane domain, was first recombinantly expressed in 2005 by Drs. Tanya Griffiths, Grant Mauk, and Ross MacGillivray at the University of British Columbia. They demonstrated that recombinant human hephaestin (rhHp) bound copper (determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) and exhibited an absorption maximum at ~610 nm consistent with other blue multicopper oxidases such as ceruloplasmin. By using ferrous ammonium sulfate as a substrate, rhHp was shown to have ferroxidase activity with a Km of 2.1 ŒºM for Fe(II). Structure Hephaestin is a member of the family of copper oxidases that includes mammalian ceruloplasmin, yeast fet3 and fet5, and bacterial ascorbate oxidase, among others. While hephaestin shares 50% amino acid sequence identity with its serum homologue ceruloplasmin, the hephaestin protein includes an additional 86 amino acids at the C-terminus, which code for a single transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic tail. While the structure and kinetic activity of ceruloplasmin have been studied extensively, hephaestin has yet to be investigated at a similar level. Comparative models of hephaestin's structure have been created using established crystallographic data from ceruloplasmin, and these studies suggest that many of the structural features important in the enzymatic function of the latter are also conserved in the former. In particular, these shared features include cysteine residues involved in disulfide bond formation, histidine residues involved in copper binding, and residues involved in the binding of the iron substrate. Proposed regulation of expression of hephaestin in response to varying iron uptake and stores. Hephaestin is thought to be both structurally modified and mislocalized in sla mice. Regulation The regulation of hephaestin expression and the protein's role in the larger picture of iron metabolism and homeostasis remain an active area of research. Some studies suggest mechanisms for local and systemic control of intestinal iron transport, in which high dietary iron intake and sufficient iron stores lead to down-regulation of DMT1, ferroportin (Ireg1) and hephaestin protein, thus minimizing iron absorption from the enterocytes into the circulation. Conversely, it is suggested that states of low dietary intake and low iron stores induce up- regulation of DMT1 as well as Ireg1 and hephaestin, thus simultaneously increasing the enterocyte's capacity for dietary iron uptake on the basolateral surface and export into the circulation on the apical surface. Relevance in Biology and Disease Hephaestin has not yet been linked to a human disease. However, when the protein was ablated in murine models, both intestine-specific and whole-body hephaestin knockout (KO) strains exhibited similarly severe accumulation of iron in the duodenal enterocytes and suffered from microcytic, hypochromic anemia, indicative of systemic iron deficiency. The shared phenotype between the two strains suggests that intestinal hephaestin plays an important role in maintaining whole-body iron homeostasis. However, since both strains were viable, it is likely that hephaestin is not essential and other compensatory mechanisms exist to keep these mice alive. In addition to the transport of iron from the intestine and into the circulation, ferroxidases also seem to play an important role in facilitating iron export from retinal cells. While deficiency in hephaestin or ceruloplasmin alone do not seem to cause iron buildup in the retina, studies done on murine models suggest that the combined deficiency is sufficient to cause age-dependent retinal pigment epithelium and retinal iron accumulation, with features consistent with macular degeneration. Hephaestin has been detected in mouse and human RPE (retinal pigment epithelial) cells as well as in rMC-1 cells (a rat M√ºller glial cell line), with greatest expression in the M√ºller endnote next to the internal limiting membrane.

It examines a period of perceived moral and cultural reform between the 1960s and New Labour's 1997 general election win. Hitchens asserts that the reforms facilitated vast and radical constitutional change under Tony Blair's new government that amounted to a \\"slow motion coup d'√©tat\\". The book was cited by Gillian Bowditch in The Times as being a major modern work to dissect \\"the decline in British morals and manners over the past 50 years\\",Gillian Bowditch: Why we all miss the kind, strong male and identified by Andrew Marr in The Observer as \\"the most sustained, internally logical and powerful attack on Tony Blair and all his works\\".1999 Andrew Marr review of The Abolition of Britain Hitchens's later book The Broken Compass explored the same themes, applied to socio-political events and culture in the 2000s decade. Synopsis The Abolition of Britain is a conservative polemic against the changes in the United Kingdom since the mid-1960s. It contrasts the funerals of Winston Churchill (1965) and Diana, Princess of Wales (1997), using these two related but dissimilar events, three decades apart, to illustrate the enormous cultural changes that took place in the intervening period. His argument is that Britain underwent a \\"cultural revolution\\", comparable to that of China in the 1960s. He describes and criticises the growing strength of such forces as multiculturalism, which still had a liberal consensus behind it at the time the book was written. He argues that English schools had largely ceased to teach the history of the country or the literature of Britain's past, criticising the preference for methodology in history teaching. Other changes gain Hitchens's attention, from the passivity and conformism resulting from the watching of television to the Church of England's rejection of its traditional liturgy and scripture. Sex education, he argues, is a form of propaganda against Christian sexual morality. Again, the sexual revolution brought about by the first contraceptive pills was the result \\"not of accidental discovery, but of research deliberately pursued by moral revolutionaries\\". He describes the efforts made to provide respectability for unmarried motherhood, not least the campaign to replace the expression \\"unmarried mother\\" with \\"single parent\\", thus lumping together those who had children out of wedlock with widowers, widows or deserted wives and husbands, and so deflecting disapproval. Hitchens sees the British establishment as being morally weak in their failure to resist the emerging drug culture, when they could easily have done so in the mid-1960s. He cites as one example the prosecution of Mick Jagger and the subsequent intervention of The Times in Jagger's defence in 1967 (\\"Who breaks a butterfly on a wheel?\\") after his (temporary) conviction. One chapter analyses the use of TV and radio soap operas to spread liberal cultural and moral propaganda, and refers to several instances where this intention has been openly expressed by the editors and authors of such programmes. In another, he attacks the development of \\"anti-establishment\\" comedy since the staging of Beyond the Fringe at the Edinburgh Festival in 1960. For Hitchens, the development of television, citing with approval a critical letter by T. S. Eliot to The Times in 1950, was something which should have led to a greater public debate than it did. In particular, Hitchens criticises the easy capture of the Conservative Party by lobbyists for commercial TV, which removed the BBC's monopoly power to defend cultural standards. He argues that the introduction of colour television, which made even the bad programmes look good, greatly increased the influence of TV over the public mind. He identifies the then Labour politician Roy Jenkins as a highly-effective campaigner for \\"cultural revolution\\". He describes the Lady Chatterley trial, describing what he calls \\"myths\\" about it, and argues that the defence of literary merit, created by the Jenkins-backed Obscene Publications Act of 1959, eventually came to be used to allow the publication of books and periodicals which had none at all. He examines Jenkins's use of cross-party alliances and, what he sees as supposed Private Members' Bills, to achieve his programme. These legislative changes had not been mentioned in the 1964 or 1966 election Labour Party manifestos, and Hitchens develops his argument by drawing on proposals Jenkins had made in the last chapter of his short book The Labour Case (1959).Roy Jenkins, The Labour Case (Harmonsdworth: Penguin, 1959), pp. 135-140 He cites warnings made by those who opposed the abolition of capital punishment, and claims that those warnings have largely proved to be correct. For Hitchens this is an example of the political elite working against the desires of the public. Hitchens's view is sustained, in the case of capital punishment, by the historian Dominic Sandbrook, in his history of what he calls the White Heat of the 1960s,Dominic Sandbrook, White Heat: A History of Britain in the Swinging Sixties (London: Little, Brown, 2006, ), p. 321 using contemporaneous opinion poll data. Hitchens went on to explore this issue in more detail in his book A Brief History of Crime. A chapter in The Abolition of Britain on the contrast between the public health policies on lung cancer and the public health policies on AIDS was left out of the first edition of the book, after Hitchens was advised that airing thoughts critical of homosexual acts would bring such criticism on it that it would distract attention from the book's main message. It was reinstated in the paperback and American editions, with an explanatory preface. Hitchens elaborated that the morality of homosexuality itself was tangential to his main argument. He wrote that British society's unwillingness to criticize sexual promiscuity among gay, bisexual, and straight men alike despite the ill after-effects stands in direct hypocritical contrast to government action against drug use. Hitchens argues that damaging moral and cultural effects on Britain occurred from the presence of huge numbers of U.S. troops during the Second World War. He also laments the cultural impact of American usage of the English language in Britain itself. For Hitchens, the major failing of the Thatcher governments was the absence of a decidedly conservative stance over cultural and moral matters. Critical reception The book received considerable attention in the British media upon its publication, and was also reviewed in a number of US newspapers. The book's reception in Britain was mixed. In a scathing review in The Guardian, Polly Toynbee mocked the book. She noted that the author \\"evokes the Britain of my own childhood, of the 50s and 60s, with a deadly accurate pen\\", but because of this factor, the book is \\"a joyful read for liberals. Most of it is given over to eulogies about the past that have precisely the opposite effect of the one intended\\".Polly Toynbee, \\"How Hague loses the plot ‚Äì and the battle over Europe\\", The Guardian 25 August 1999 Other British reviewers were more positive in their assessments. Mary Kenny in the Catholic Herald considered it \\"a series of knowledgeable and perceptive linked essays in the tradition of George Orwell\\".Mary Kenny, \\"The anti- conservative culture\\", Catholic Herald, 27 August 1999 John Colvin, writing in the New Statesman thought the \\"barren times\\" in which we live \\"have found their ideal chronicler\\" who \\"in this clear and uninhibited work, reminds us of the tyranny of the new\\" and that \\"it is difficult to contradict his belief that a great nation seems almost to have vanished, its traditions mocked and enfeebled\\".John Colvin, \\"Beast in view\\", New Statesman, 27 September 1999 In The Spectator, John Redwood wrote that he was \\"exhilarated\\" by the book, and that Hitchens had written with \\"passion and flair\\". Redwood added that Hitchens was at his best when \\"exposing the way in which our educational system and cultural standards have been systematically undermined\\".\\"Presenting the past as another place\\" review in The Spectator, 11 September 1999 by John Redwood Also writing in The Spectator, Peregrine Worsthorne was more circumspect: \\"after eloquently telling the tale of how successive British parliamentary governments, Tory as much as Labour, have 'abolished' old Britain, Hitchens reaches the wholly illogical conclusion that that same British democracy alone is quite capable of putting the clock back\\".Peregrine Worsthorne, \\"As I Was Saying: Only a federal Europe can stop the abolition of Britain\\", The Spectator, 3 September 1999 He also stated that Hitchens was wrong to hold Eurosceptic views. Alan Cowell, in a mostly critical review in The New York Times, stated \\"in the 1950s and 60s, Britain was a gentler, more deferential place; the churches were better attended; children did give up their bus seats to adults; and a generation was nurtured on a history of wartime victory and imperial grandeur that had yet to be derided as myth or oppression\\". However, Cowell questioned the \\"Canute-like subtext\\" of the book that \\"the destructive forces of television, McDonald's and American popular culture could have been held back\\".\\"Will There Always Be One?\\" The New York Times review by Alan Cowell In The Weekly Standard, another US publication, Jonathan Foreman wrote that \\"at its best this book combines superb reporting (especially about the hijacking of education by frustrated leftists) with a heartbreaking analysis of one of the strangest revolutions in history. And in many ways it is the most important of the torrent of books that have dealt with the crisis of British identity\\". However, Foreman added that the book suffered from \\"cranky fogeyism\\", and he was particularly critical of both the chapter analysing the Chatterley trial and the premise that satirical television and radio programmes of the late 1950s and early 1960s contributed towards destroying British national unity.\\"The Battle of Britain ‚Äì Is the sun setting on the United Kingdom?\\" review in The Weekly Standard (US) 12 March 2001 by Jonathan Foreman Publishing history The book was first published in Britain by Quartet Books in 1999 (), and then in a revised edition the following year.

Biography  He was the eldest son of the third king, Mahuta, and Te Marae, daughter of the fighting chief Amukete Te Kerei who was killed in battle at Rangiriri in November 1863. Te Rata was born sometime between 1877 and 1880. He had four younger brothers: Taipu (who died in March 1926), Tumate, Tonga and Te Rauangaanga. He married Te Uranga, daughter of Iriwhata Wharemaki and Hira Wati of NgƒÅti Korokƒ´. Te Rata was invested with the kingship on 24 November 1912, about two weeks after his father's death. As was the custom for a new MƒÅori King, he assumed the title name of P≈çtatau Te Wherowhero, beginning a kingship dogged by ill health and controversy. Te Rata Mahuta had at least four children; * Korokƒ´ Te Rata Mahuta TƒÅwhiao Potatau Te Wherowhero (m) (with Te Uranga) and, * Taipu Mahuta (m) (with Te Uranga), and * Hori (George) Te Rata (m) (with Maata Paora) * Keti Maata Paora (f) (with Maata Paora) Korokƒ´ became Te Rata's successor upon his death. Of his other sons, Taipu had died in 1924, and Hori was not recognised at the insistence of Te Puea Herangi, Te Rata's influential cousin. As a child, Te Rata had been a chronic invalid and had suffered several illnesses including rheumatoid arthritis and heart disease. The former greatly affected his ability to carry out his role as King. This was particularly apparent during an expedition to England in 1914. This expedition had been undertaken with the aim of presenting British officials with a petition concerning breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi; namely, that MƒÅori land had been unjustly confiscated following the New Zealand wars. However, during his voyage to England, Te Rata ended up suffering repeated attacks of rheumatics. For example, during a stop-over in Honolulu, he was unable to accept an invitation from the nation's aging Queen Lili ªuokalani, the last ruler of her people prior to annexation. Furthermore, these attacks continued following his arrival in England on 21 May 1914. Indeed, Te Rata was so unwell that he ended up turning down a meeting with important British officials, although he eventually was able to meet with King George and Queen Mary. He died at Waahi on 1 October 1933. The Labour leader Harry Holland died unexpectedly of a heart attack at his funeral.

It is separated into three falls by rocks and trees, and the thundering effect of the water hitting the cliffs can be heard from afar. It is currently the 4th largest waterfall along a national border, after Iguazu Falls, Victoria Falls, and Niagara Falls. Somewhat nearby is the 1000m long by 200m wide Tongling Gorge (t≈çng l√≠ng d√† xi√° g«î ÈÄöÁÅµÂ§ßÂ≥°Ë∞∑ \\"Tongling Grand Canyon\\") in Jingxi County (ÈùñË•øÂéø), Baise City (ÁôæËâ≤Â∏Ç) of Guangxi (Th√¥ng Linh-ƒê·∫°i T√¢n-Tƒ©nh T√¢y-B√°ch S·∫Øc-Qu·∫£ng T√¢y), accessible only through a cavern from an adjoining gorge. Rediscovered only recently, it has many species of endemic plants, found only in the gorge. Geology The waterfalls are located in an area of mature karst formations where the original limestone bedrock layers are being eroded. Numerous streams spring from underground fissures along the lower levels of the area. The waterfalls have multiple drops, from bedrock layer to layer, which shows the multiple depositions of sediments of different hardness which formed the terrain over millions of years. History View from China in dry season View of the falls from Vietnam during the rainy season when the flow is at its maximum A road running along the top of the falls leads to a stone marker that demarcates the border between China and Vietnam in French and Chinese. Modern disputes arose as there are discrepancies as to the correlating legal documents on border demarcation and the placement of markers between the French and Qing administrations in the 19th century.Vietnamese Embassy: On the settlement of Vietnam-China border issue vietnamembassy-usa.org Disputes regarding the border demarcation at this location were settled in 1999 Viet Nam-China Treaty on Land Borderline. Additional talks were held as late as 2009 to clarify the treaty. However, there are controversies regarding the border demarcation around the Falls. One faction holds that the entirety of these falls belongs to Vietnam, and that the stone tablet had been moved there some time during or after the brief Sino-Vietnamese war of 1979.The implementation of Vietnam-China land border treaty: bilateral and regional implications. Do Thi Thuy 5/3/2009 PDF To the southeast, the land dispute also along the Sino-Vietnamese border also includes Nam Quan Gate (·∫¢i Nam Quan) which the Vietnamese claimed as well. Historically,Han Nam Quan 3 (English) \\"In Westminster, an Internet Bid to Restore Viet Land\\" Los Angeles TimesInterview On Territory And Territorial Waters - General Nam Quan Gate served as the border marker and entry point to Vietnam between Vietnam & China (hence there's also a Vietnamese historical saying, that Vietnam stretched from Cape C√† Mau to ·∫¢i Nam Quan). Impact on industry and commerce The waterfalls increase the quality of life for people who live within the sound of the falls. A road running along the top of the falls leads to a stone marker that demarcates the border between China and Vietnam in French and Chinese. 20th century disputes could not be resolved where inaccuracies in documents, maps and descriptions that were made in the 19th century became difficult to universally comprehend. The disappearance or inaccurate replacement of markers and landmarks from time to time, and the varied patterns of transportation, settlement and land use from generation to generation, and the successive administrative differences throughout periods of war and strife led to both Vietnam and China understanding that exactly defining the border would increase prosperity in the long term. The commercial focus of the area directly around the falls will likely remain tourism. =Transport= There are two directional aspects to transport at a waterfall: (1) portage along the river's course; and (2) fording or rafting across the river. Ban Gioc‚ÄìDetian Falls was one of the crossing points for Chinese forces during the Sino-Vietnamese War. Rafts are currently used to boat tourists closer to the falls and return them to their dock of origination. Preservation efforts Preservation of the resource may require future cooperation between the local communities by use of a perpetual joint oversight committee.

Hohentwiel began forming, along with the chain of volcanoes in the Hegau region, about 7‚Äì8 million years ago, when a layer of volcanic ash and stone was laid down. The magma consists of phonolite. In the following millions of years, the core was opened 260 metres beneath the surface by the glaciers from the ice age. This formed the core that is now exposed, after the ensuing millions of years of erosion. , whose ruins are on top of Hohentwiel, was built in 914 using stone taken from the mountain by Burchard II, Duke of Swabia. Originally, the Monastery of St. Georg was within the fortress, but in 1005 it was moved to Stein am Rhein (now in Switzerland), and the Swabian dukes lost control of Hohentwiel. In the later Middle Ages the noble families von Singen-Twiel (12th‚Äì13th centuries), von Klingen (to 1300) and von Klingenberg (to 1521) resided here. In 1521, it was passed on to Duke Ulrich von W√ºrttemberg, who developed Hohentwiel into one of the strongest fortresses of his duchy. During this time, it began to be used as a prison, and in 1526, Hans M√ºller von Bulgenbach, a peasant commander, was imprisoned there before he was executed.Miller, Douglas.

It was released on 9 June 2009, and focuses on Indiana Jones as he searches for his former mentor Charles Kingston, while working to prevent the Nazis from acquiring the \\"Staff of Kings\\", said to be the same staff used by Moses to part the Red Sea. The game is the third in the series of original 3D Indiana Jones games, preceded by Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb, and Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine. The Wii version also includes a copy of a previous LucasArts game, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, as an unlockable. The game was initially developed for the higher-end PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 systems, before switching to the aforementioned lower-end platforms. As a result, neither console saw an original Indiana Jones video game besides the two Lego Indiana Jones games. The game received mixed reviews from critics.  Gameplay  The plot centers around Indy's search for the Staff of Moses, a journey which takes him to several locations including the Sudan, Panama, San Francisco, and Nepal. The game incorporates a linear structure which includes puzzles to solve, obstacles to clear, and enemies that must either be defeated through hand-to- hand combat, shot down with Indy's sidearm, or defeated using the environment around them. Motion controls allow the player to throw punches, use the bullwhip, and perform a wide variety of actions. The Wii version of the game includes an exclusive co-op story mode (with Indy and Henry Jones Sr.) and unlockable version of the classic point and click adventure Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis (also set in 1939). On the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions Big Head mode, Henry Jones Sr., Tuxedo Indy, and Han Solo from Star Wars are unlockable.  Plot  The story begins with Indiana Jones hunting for an ancient ram's head idol in the Sudan in 1939, which a Nazi expedition is also searching for. Indy traverses a canyon and enters the temple of the idol. After a few narrow escapes, including fighting off a swarm of spiders and nearly getting crushed by collapsing statues, Indy finds the idol and is about to escape when the Nazis discover him. Indy is confronted by their leader, Magnus Voller, an archeologist and old rival of Indy's. Indy is forced to give up the idol, but is able to distract Voller and fight his way through the Nazi camp. He gets in a truck and chases after a plane that is taking off down the runway; he manages to jump onto the wing and throw the pilot out. After getting in a dogfight with other Nazi planes, Indy flies off and returns to the United States. Back in America, Indiana receives a letter from an old friend, antiques collector Archie Tan. He explains that he has information about the disappearance of Indy's former college professor, Charles Kingston. Indy heads to San Francisco to talk to Archie, only to find that he and his granddaughter Suzie have been kidnapped by the local triad. Indy rescues Suzie, and she takes him to her grandfather's office. He also learns of an ancient artifact that Archie was guarding, the Jade Sphere. Indy finds a secret passageway, and then rides a rickety chair lift down into a subterranean chamber filled with old ships. The chairlift gets hit by a thug with a pistol, but Indy manages to survive the ride down. He meets more thugs down below, but dispatches them before finding the Jade Sphere hidden in a pile of cannonballs. A day later, Indy finds Archie being held captive by Magnus Voller and a Nazi agent. Voller orders Indy to hand over the Sphere if he wants to save his friend. Indy appears to throw the Sphere to Voller before he and Archie flee, but it turns out to be nothing but a cheap statue. Indy and Archie are chased by gunmen in cars; Indy uses his pistol to shoot out the tires or engines of the cars (in the Nintendo DS version, this is replaced by a brawl on top of a cable car), and Archie helps him escape in a street trolley. After Archie tells Indy about the events that transpired, he decides to head for Panama, where Kingston found the Sphere years ago. Upon reaching his destination, Indy gets into a minor argument with an Irish photographer named Maggie O'Mally, who forces him to let her accompany him. However, their campsite and the surrounding forest are attacked by native mercenaries in Magnus' employment. Indy manages to fend off the attackers (He also saves a village of Indians in the Wii and PS2 version), and obtains the key to an ancient pyramid. Indy travels through the ruined pyramid, which is based on the Mayan underworld, which leads to a hidden diary of Kingston's revealing details of the Staff of Kings, the artifact that Moses used to part the Red Sea. After obtaining further clues on the staff's location in Istanbul, Indy locates the elderly Kingston in a Nepalese village. Unfortunately, the Nazis have followed Indiana to the Staff's resting place and kidnap Kingston and Maggie (who is actually an undercover MI6 agent). Indy then sneaks onto the Nazis' zeppelin, the Odin, and rescues Maggie, but is unable to prevent Magnus from fatally shooting Kingston and using the Staff to clear a path through the Red Sea. In response, Indy and Maggie chase Magnus on a motorcycle with a sidecar and defeat him with a rocket launcher. Magnus then attempts to escape, but Indy sucker-punches him into the wall of water. Upon reaching dry land, the staff unleashes a blast that causes the water to sink the Odin. It then turns into a snake, and Indy throws it away, lamenting \\"Ugh.. It can take care of itself...\\".  Development  The game was announced in 2005. In a July 2008 interview with DailyGame, a LucasArts representative dismissed rumours of the game's cancellation, stating that it was \\"very deep into development\\". The game was initially intended to target the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, leveraging their power to display more advanced graphics while using the same engine as the high-definition versions of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, but was later switched to lower-end consoles and handhelds. The game's story was inspired by Raiders of the Lost Ark and is a collaborative effort of the design and management teams at LucasArts, with one of the writers being Peter Hirschmann. It was created a few years before the release and received some input from George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. Reception Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" according to Metacritic. Several critics reviewed the Wii version. IGN praised its interface, graphic effects, number of extras, interactive levels, and varied gameplay, but criticized its \\"stupidly implemented motion controls\\". The A.V. Club gave it an F. They called the motion controls \\"inexcusable\\" and stated the game's best aspect was the inclusion of the point-and-click adventure Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis. GameSpot criticized its \\"terribly laid-out checkpoints\\", \\"out-of-date\\" visuals, and \\"atrocious, annoying motion controls\\".

She found fame in the 1990s with her massive disco polo hits such as \\"Baiao Bongo\\", \\"Bierz co chcesz\\", \\"Egipskie noce\\" or \\"Noc r√≥≈ºy\\". Having been proclaimed \\"the queen of disco polo\\", Shazza remains one of the best-selling singers of the genre.. Career At the end of the 1980s she joined a disco polo group Toy Boys, with whom she recorded first albums in the early 1990s. Her career as a solo artist began in 1992 with an album Sex Appeal. She enjoyed success with songs like \\"Jeste≈õ moim idea≈Çem\\" and \\"Jambalaya Mix\\". In 1994 Shazza had her first major hit with \\"Baiao Bongo\\", a cover version of an old 50s song originally performed by Natasza Zylska. The album of the same name became a best-seller and the song \\"18 lat\\" also enjoyed popularity. Her videos were heavily aired in Disco Relax, a popular Sunday morning TV show. The breakthrough in Shazza's career came in 1995. The song \\"Bierz co chcesz\\" became a massive hit and its music video is now considered cult. The track was included on her next album, Egipskie noce, which also included \\"Tak bardzo zakochani\\", \\"Mi≈Ço≈õƒá i zdrada\\" and popular title song. The album turned out her highest-selling record to date. It was followed by Noc r√≥≈ºy in 1996, which presented more sophisticated sound. 1997 saw the release of Tak blisko nieba, her first album issued by a new record label. The biggest hit off the album was \\"Ma≈Çe pieski dwa\\", and it also included a cover of ABBA's \\"Hasta Ma√±ana\\". Her next album, Historia pewnej mi≈Ço≈õci, was another change of style and consisted of more dance-oriented songs. However, it didn't meet with such positive reception as her previous efforts had done. In 1999 and 2000 Shazza released collections of her greatest hits. She also took part in a nude photo session for the Polish Playboy magazine. The issue with her on the cover turned out to be a big success. After signing up to EMI record label, Shazza released her next album Jestem sobƒÖ in 2001. It was a clear departure from the disco polo sound with which she'd been associated. Singles \\"Jestem sobƒÖ\\" and \\"Mo≈ºe to samba\\" were minor hits, but the sales of the album proved disappointing and the singer was dropped by the label. After this Shazza decided to take a break from music. She moved to the USA and made a modest comeback in 2007, when she re-recorded some of her most known hits.

Like all forms of synesthesia, grapheme‚Äìcolor synesthesia is involuntary, consistent and memorable. Grapheme‚Äìcolor synesthesia is one of the most common forms of synesthesia and, because of the extensive knowledge of the visual system, one of the most studied. While it is extremely unlikely that any two synesthetes will report the same colors for all letters and numbers, studies of large numbers of synesthetes find that there are some commonalities across letters (e.g., \\"A\\" is likely to be red).Day, S.A. (2005), \\"Some Demographic and Socio- cultural Aspects of Synesthesia\\" in L. Robertson & N. Sagiv, ed., Synesthesia: Perspectives from Cognitive Neuroscience, Oxford: Oxford University Press, , pp. 11‚Äì33 Early studies argued that grapheme‚Äìcolor synesthesia was not due to associative learning, such as from playing with colored refrigerator magnets. However, one recent study has documented a case of synesthesia in which synesthetic associations could be traced back to colored refrigerator magnets. Despite the existence of this individual case, the majority of synesthetic associations do not seem to be driven by learning of this sort. Rather, it seems that more frequent letters are paired with more frequent colors, and some meaning-based rules, such as ‚Äòb‚Äô being blue, drive most synesthetic associations. There has been a lot more research as to why and how synesthesia occurs with more recent technology and as synesthesia has become more well known. It has been found that grapheme‚Äìcolor synesthetes have more grey matter in their brain. There is evidence of an increased grey matter volume in the left caudal intraparietal sulcus (IPS). There was also found to be an increased grey matter volume in the right fusiform gyrus. These results are consistent with another study on the brain functioning of grapheme‚Äìcolor synesthetes. Grapheme‚Äìcolor synesthetes tend to have an increased thickness, volume and surface area of the fusiform gyrus. Furthermore, the area of the brain where word, letter and color processing are located, V4a, is where the most significant difference in make-up was found. Though not certain, these differences are thought to be part of the reasoning for the presence of grapheme‚Äìcolor synesthesia. Experiences and reports Synesthetes often report that they were unaware their experiences were unusual until they realized other people did not have them, while others report feeling as if they had been keeping a secret their entire lives. Many synesthetes can vividly remember when they first noticed their synesthetic experiences, or when they first learned that such experiences were unusual. Writer and synesthete Patricia Lynne Duffy remembers one early experience: As does filmmaker Stephanie Morgenstern: As reported by poet and screenwriter Stephen Bishop 3rd: On the other hand, many synesthetes never realize that their experiences are in any way unusual or exceptional. For example, the Nobel prize winning physicist, Richard Feynman reports: While synesthetes sometimes report seeing colors projected in space, they do not confuse their synesthetic colors with real colors in the external world. Rather, they report that they are simultaneously aware of the external color and also the internal, synesthetic color: Finally, synesthetes are quite precise in the color mappings that they experience, which can lead them to make quite detailed comparisons of their colors: Further research Individuals with grapheme‚Äìcolor synesthesia rarely claim that their sensations are problematic or unwanted. In some cases, individuals report useful effects, such as aid in memory or spelling of difficult words. These experiences have led to the development of technologies intended to improve the retention and memory of graphemes by individuals without synesthesia. Computers, for instance, could use \\"artificial synesthesia\\" to color words and numbers to improve usability. A somewhat related example of \\"computer-aided synesthesia\\" is using letter coloring in a web browser to prevent IDN homograph attacks. (Someone with synesthesia can sometimes distinguish between barely different looking characters in a similar way.) Ideasthesia Evidence indicates that grapheme color synesthesia may be actually a case of ideasthesia. In other words, the vivid concurrent experiences of color may be induced by the concepts of graphemes and not by their sensory representations.

Lang (born November 26, 1949) is an American politician, lobbyist, and former Democratic member of the Illinois House of Representatives, representing the 16th District from 1987 until 2019.  Personal life and education  Lou graduated from the University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign in 1971 with High Honors where he obtained a B.A. in Political Science, before earning a Doctor of Jurisprudence degree with Honors from Depaul University, College of Law in 1974. Born in Chicago in 1949, Lang has been a Skokie resident since the age of five, and is a Niles North High School alumnus. He is a member of the Chicago Bar Association, Illinois State Bar Association, Turning Point's Advisory Council, Asian American Caucus, among many other organizations. Lang is currently Of Counsel to Del Galdo Law Group, LLC. He is the father of five children, and a grandfather to three grandchildren.  Political career  Lang served as attorney for Niles Township for ten years, before being appointed to the Illinois House in 1987 by the Niles Township Democratic Organization to fill the vacancy of Representative Alan J. Greiman. The district at very times included Skokie, Lincolnwood, Morton Grove, and portions of neighboring Chicago. Lang serves as committeeman for Niles Township Democratic Organization, Executive Vice Chairman for the Cook County Democratic Party, and as Secretary of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. In 1993, Lang advanced to House Democratic Floor Leader, a post he held until 1997 when he assumed the position of Assistant Majority Leader, and in 2009 Lang became Deputy Majority Leader. Lang also served in several other leadership roles, including the Legislative Ethics Committee, and the Joint Committee on Administrative Rules (JCAR). Lang resigned from the aforementioned leadership posts on May 31st, 2018 amid harassment allegations from a longtime activist who accused him of repeated harassment and intimidation. On September 5, 2018 after a thorough investigation, Illinois' Inspector General absolved Lang of all allegations. He continued to serve as State Representative, and after receiving a partnership offer from prominent lobbying firm Advantage Government Strategies, Lang submitted his resignation as State Representative effective January 7, 2019. Lang remains Committeeman of the Niles Township Democratic Organization, and Executive Vice Chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party.  Legislation   Gambling  Lang was a strong advocate for legalized gambling. In 2009, he sponsored the Video Gaming Act which legalized the use of video gambling machines in Illinois. A 2019 ProPublica investigation found that Illinois gambling regulators were underfunded and understaffed, and the gambling failed to meet projected revenues for the state's public coffers.  Infrastructure  In 2009, Lang passed HB38 which was a long sought-after, 6 year, $32 billion construction program that focused on fixing schools, roads, and bridges in Illinois. The program was expected to create 439,000 new jobs by 2015, and would be subsidized through newly legalized gaming machines in bars. Although trouble in implementation occurred following the passage of the bill, after various delays, the program was executed.  Social  Lang has supported increases in minimum wage, opposed efforts to weaken worker compensation laws, and won a 7% property tax assessment cap for Cook County homeowners. In 2009 Lang co- sponsored Illinois' marriage equality law, and in 2017 he co-sponsored HB40, legislation protecting women's reproductive rights. On May 30th, 2018, Illinois succeeded in ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment. After twenty-five years of unsuccessful attempts at ratification, Lang, House Chief Sponsor of the ERA, was celebrated as Illinois became the 37th state to ratify.  Healthcare  Lang has championed several major bills dealing with mental health and healthcare reform. Lang was Chief Sponsor of HB1, a bill legalizing Medical Cannabis in Illinois. The bill became law in 2013 after it passed both chambers and was signed by then Governor Pat Quinn. As the national opioid crisis increasingly worsened, in 2015, Lang Chief Sponsored the Heroin Crisis Act, a bill used as a national model for battling the Heroin epidemic. In 2017, Lang was the Chief Sponsor of HR378, a resolution elevating awareness for maternal mental health. Lang has also passed several bills dealing with mental health parity, and during the 100th General Assembly, Lang both authored and Chief Sponsored SB1707, dubbed the strongest mental health parity law in the nation.

Oog in Al is a residential area in the west of the city of Utrecht in the Netherlands. The Amsterdam‚ÄìRhine Canal, the Merwede Canal and the Leidse Rijn canal form the area's limits, rendering it a man-made island in the shape of a triangle. From the 12th century, the area of present-day Oog in Al was part of the 'Trechter Weide', the communal meadow of the city of Utrecht. The meadow was divided in the 'Hoge Weide' and 'Lage Weide' (high meadow and low meadow), divided by a canal, the Vletsloot. Oog in Al was later built in the 'Hoge Weide' part of the communal meadow. The Leidse Rijn was dug in 1663‚Äì1664 as a water transport link between Utrecht and Leiden. The Utrecht nobleman Everard Meyster built a residential estate in a curve of the new canal, where a new city expansion planned by mayor Hendrik Moreelse, could best be viewed. For this reason Meyster called his estate \\"Oog in Al\\" (Eye on All). When the Merwede Canal was dug at the end of the 19th century, the area surrounding the estate underwent a radical change. As the Canal could only be crossed by way of a limited number of bridges, it constituted a barrier to further city expansion in the Oog in Al area. The City of Utrecht nevertheless purchased the ground in 1918 with a view to the development of a new residential area. The architects Berlage and Holsboer designed the layout of Utrecht's western expansion, which included plans for the residential area Oog in Al. Adjacent to the present-day Park Oog in Al, a first batch of 381 spacious middle-class homes was constructed in 1921. Meyster's estate was preserved and currently houses the area's public library. The street pattern of the south eastern part of present-day Oog in Al reflects the original design of Berlage and Holsboer.

The classification of Northeastern Mandarin as a separate dialect group from Beijing Mandarin was first proposed by Li Rong, author of the Language Atlas of China, in 1989. However, many researchers do not accept the distinction.  Geographical distribution  Northeastern Mandarin varieties are spoken in the northeastern part of China, in the provinces of Liaoning (except its southern part from Dalian to Dandong where Jiaoliao Mandarin is spoken), Jilin and Heilongjiang, and in some northern parts of Inner Mongolia. The number of speakers was estimated in 1987 as 82 million. The Language Atlas of China divided Northeastern Mandarin into three subgroups, following a classification be H√® Wƒìi based on the occurrence of nasal initials in words having a zero initial in Beijing: * J√≠‚ÄìShƒõn (ÂêâÊ≤à) in the east, including Jilin dialect and Shenyang dialect, has a zero initial in these words, as in Beijing. * HƒÅ‚ÄìF√π (ÂìàÈòú) in the west, including Harbin dialect and Changchun dialect, have nasal initials in these words. * Hƒìi‚ÄìS≈çng (ÈªëÊùæ) in the north, including Qiqihar dialect, have zero or nasal initials in random variation. More distant varieties tend to be more similar to the Beijing dialect than closer ones, so that the speech of Harbin is closer to that of Beijing than that of Jilin and Changchun, which in turn are closer than that of Shenyang. A form of Northeastern Mandarin (with some words from Udege and Nanai) has been spoken since approximately 1800 by the Taz people nearby in the Russian Far East, primarily in Primorsky Krai. Overseas, Northeastern Mandarin is spoken in increasingly larger communities in New York City Chinatowns/Flushing in the United States. Phonology Northeastern Mandarin shares similarities with the Beijing dialect, such as a similar development of the entering tone and the preservation of initial , where the dialects of Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing, have . However, in northeastern Chinese, final -ian or -√ºan is pronounced with an rather than with or as in the standard. The initial of Beijing (spelled r- in pinyin) is generally omitted in northeastern varieties. Cultural and regional identity Mandarin variants like Northeastern Mandarin often contribute to a strong regional identity. Because of its informal usage of words and tones, comedians often use Northeast dialects when performing. Comedian Zhao Benshan is recognized nationwide for his performances which make humorous use of Northeastern dialect and Northeastern Errenzhuan folk dance and song traditions.

He used following pen-names: Danylo Mlaka, Demko Makoviychuk, Morozenko, Semen Khrin, Isydor Vorobkevych, S.Volokh, and others.  Biography  Sydir Vorobkevych was born 18 May 1836 in Chernivtsi to a family of Orthodox priests and theologians. His brother was Ukrainian poet Hryhoriy Vorobkevych. Vorobkevych's great-grandfather, Skalsky Mlaka de Orobko, ran away from Lithuania, and his grandfather changed his name from Orobko to Vorobkevych. He later used part of the former name as part of his pseudonym Danilo Mlaka. His mother died early in 1840, and his father Ivan worked in the Chernivtsi Lyceum as a professor of religion and philosophy. His father died in 1845 and Sydir along with his brother Hryhoriy were left orphans. They went to live with their grandfather, Mykhailo Vorobkevych, the Protopope of Kitsman. In his family the young Vorobkevyches learned Ukrainian folklore and history. Soon Sydir enrolled in the Chernivtsi Lyceum and later the Theology Seminary in Chernivtsi, graduating in 1861. He began to compose his first verses as a student. After seminary, Vorobkevych began an internship as a priest in the neighboring villages. Later he enrolled in the musical courses of the Vienna Conservatory under professor Franz Krenn. Since 1867, Vorobkevych had been a singing instructor in the Chernivtsi Theology Seminary and Lyceum, and in 1868 he took a test for certified singing instructor and choir regent. In 1875, he became a singing instructor at the Theological Department of the Chernivtsi University. During that time, he already worked as a composer creating his own songs, psalms, choir works, operettas, and others. His first poetic works Vorobkevych published in 1863 in the Halychanyn collection under the title Thoughts from Bukovina. In 1877 he released the first Bukovina almanac Ruthenian hut. Sydir Vorobkevych was one of the creators and chief-editors of the magazine Bokovinian dawn. In Chernivtsi University he headed the \\"Ruthenian Literary Association\\" and, starting in 1876, the students' union - \\"Soyuz\\". In 1887, Vorobkevych was the leader of the association \\"Ruthenian house public\\" in Chernivtsi. Sydir Vorobkevych wrote in Ukrainian, Romanian, and German languages. Among his works are \\"Turkish recruits\\" (1865), poem \\"Nechai\\" (1868), dramas \\"Petro Sahaidachny\\" (1884), \\"Kochubei and Mazepa\\" (1891), \\"Lost son\\". Vorobkevych's talent is depicted most completely in his lyrical poems where the poet \\"spills the great riches of life's observations enlighten by a quiet sparkling of sincere, deep, human, and people-relating feeling\\" (Ivan Franko). The prominent characteristics of Vorobkevych's poetry are folkore and a melodious quality. After a trip to Kiev in 1874, he wrote choir works \\"Tsar-river our Dnieper\\" and \\"I was born upon Dnieper, therefore I am Cossack\\". During his lifetime, a collection of his poems entitled on the Prut (1901) was published, edited by Ivan Franko, who called him the \\"first new spring lark of our national revival.\\" A series of the poet's series of short stories, novels and essays, called Peru, included \\"Nero\\", \\"Sablya Skanderbeg\\", \\"Cleopatra,\\" and \\"Ivan the Terrible\\". He was the author of a series of articles \\"Our composers,\\" which prominently designated composer Mikhail Glinka. Vorobkevych wrote many and diverse the genre of literary, musical compositions - choruses, songs, and operettas. He wrote music to the words of Ukrainian and Romanian poets like Taras Shevchenko,Ivan Franko, Vasile Alecsandri, Mihai Eminescu, Vasile Bumbac. As a music teacher in particular, among his students was a prominent Austrian musicologist Ukrainian origin Eusebius Mandychevskyy. Sydir Vorobkevicha died on 19 September 1903 in Chernivtsi. Works Vorobkevych is author of several didactic works, among which the following: * \\"Manual of musical harmony\\" (Czernowitz, 1869); * \\"Songs of Mass choir of St. John Chrysostom\\" (1869, ed.

He played college football at Dartmouth College in the Ivy League, and was not selected in the 1981 NFL Draft. In 1984, Kemp led the Rams with thirteen touchdown passes and a trip to the playoffs. As a back-up to the injured Joe Montana in 1986, he threw eleven touchdown passes for the 49ers. Kemp is the son of late former AFL quarterback and American politician Jack Kemp (1935‚Äì2009), and brother of former Canadian Football League quarterback Jimmy Kemp (b. 1971). Kemp and his wife, Stacy, have four sons: Kyle, Kory, Kolby, and Keegan. He graduated from Winston Churchill High School in Potomac, Maryland, a northwest suburb of Washington, D.C. in Montgomery County. College career In 1979, Jeff Kemp was named the starting quarterback for the Dartmouth Big Green, winning the job over Joe McLaughlin. That season, Dartmouth, led by head coach Joseph Yukica went 4-3 in Ivy League play (4-4-1 overall). Dartmouth finished fifth in the Ivy League, just behind Cornell and ahead of Harvard. Playing in all nine games that season, Kemp completed 81 passes on 182 attempts for 915 yard. He threw six touchdown passes and five interceptions. His primary target was wide receiver Dave Shula. Whereas Kemp was the son of legendary quarterback Jack Kemp, Shula was the son of then Dolphins head coach Don Shula. The 1980 season started with a 40-7 win over a very weak University of Pennsylvania team.https://www.sports- reference.com/cfb/boxscores/1980-09-20-dartmouth.html Dartmouth would also score a decisive win over Columbia as well, 48-0. While Dartmouth, led by Kemp scored 207 points, they yielded 170 and ended up going 4-3 in league, and 4-6 overall. Kemp's college career ended with a 27-24 loss to Princeton.https://www.sports- reference.com/cfb/boxscores/1980-11-22-princeton.html Pro career In 1981, Kemp signed with the Los Angeles Rams as an undrafted free agent. Kemp was one of four quarterbacks the Rams carried on the roster that season. When former starter Vince Ferragamo bolted the Rams to sign with Montreal of the Canadian Football League, the Rams inserted Pat Haden as the full time starter, with Raiders cast off Dan Pastorini as the second string and former draft pick Jeff Rutledge as the third stringer quarterback. Pastorini drew the start against the Washington Redskins and was ineffective, going 8 for 21 and two interceptions. With the Rams down 30-7, Kemp made his NFL debut late in the game. He went two for six with an interception.https://www.pro-football- reference.com/boxscores/198112200ram.htm Kemp would not see the field at all during the strike shortened 1982 season, and made a handful of appearances during the 1983 season. One of those games was a token appearance to do a kneel down during the Rams 41-17 blow out win against the Buffalo Bills, a team his father starred for and won a championship with back during the days of the American Football League in the 1960s. That season the Rams made the play offs and faced the Redskins in the divisional play off game. Rams starter Vince Ferragamo played one of the worst games of his career, throwing three interceptions. He was benched in favor of Kemp, but by then it was too late. The Redskins routed the Rams 51-7. In 1984, after Ferragamo went 1-3 as a starter to begin the season, Head Coach John Robinson made the switch, benching the one time Rams star in favor of Jeff Kemp. Kemp started the rest of the season, and finished with a 9-4 record as a starter, completing 143 passes out of 284 attempts for 2,021 yards, with thirteen touchdown passes against seven interceptions. The Rams finished 10-6, but lost to the New York Giants in the wild card play off game. The following season, the Rams traded Ferragamo to the Buffalo Bills for tight end Tony Hunter. Despite Ferragamo being gone, Kemp was not assured to be the starter. Despite the poise and ability to start he showed during the 1984 season, the Rams signed Canadian League star Dieter Brock to be the team's starting quarterback. Kemp only made one start that season, a 24-17 loss to the Giants. The Rams cast their luck with Brock, who did manage to lead the team to the play offs, where they were trounced by the Chicago Bears and their vaunted 46 defense. The following season, the Rams revamped their quarterback rotation against. Brock left to go back to Canada, and the Rams signed former falcons star Steve Bartkowski and acquired Jim Everett from the Houston Oilers. Kemp was not re-signed and played the 1986 season with the Rams rival, the San Francisco 49ers, where he backed-up Joe Montana. When Montana was injured, Kemp started six games, going 3-2-1 during that period. One of those games was a 31-16 win over the Miami Dolphins, coached by Don Shula, the father of Dave Shula, one of Kemp's teammates at Dartmouth. The next season, Kemp was with the Seattle Seahawks and was one of the players who crossed the picket lines. He won his only start that year, a 32-17 victory over a Detroit Lions made up of mainly replacement players. Kemp would play with the Seahawks for the bulk of his remaining years in the NFL. He was released during the 1991 season, but quickly found a job with the Philadelphia Eagles. The Eagles struggled at quarterback that season, mainly with injuries. Starter Randall Cunningham went down, followed by back up Jim McMahon. Rookie Brad Goebel was inserted, but quickly too was a victim of the injury bug. The Eagles signed Kemp, and then coaxed former Jets quarterback Pat Ryan out of retirement. Kemp started two games for the Eagles, going one and one. The 1991 season was Kemp's last as an NFL player. He finished with a 16-12-1 record as a starter. He also finished with 39 touchdowns versus 40 interceptions.https://www.pro-football- reference.com/players/K/KempJe00.htm Post NFL career In the years following the conclusion of his playing career, Jeff Kemp became a motivational speaker and wrote a book called \\"Facing the Blitz\\".https://www.jackkempfoundation.org/post/former-nfl-quarterback-jeff- kemp-on-fox-and-friends References External links * 1959 births Living people American football quarterbacks Dartmouth Big Green football players Los Angeles Rams players Philadelphia Eagles players San Francisco 49ers players Seattle Seahawks players People from Potomac, Maryland Sportspeople from Santa Ana, California Players of American football from Maryland ","title":"Jeff Kemp"},{"id":"6481924","text":"Shadow Watch is a 2000 Microsoft Windows video game by Red Storm Entertainment. Gameplay It is a turn-based tactics game in which the player fights a conspiracy to halt construction of an international space station. It is based on the Tom Clancy's Power Plays novel Shadow Watch. The player's team consists of six operatives, each of which has a specialist skill. These abilities can be upgraded and characters learn moves after enough experience points are earned. Missions are somewhat randomised, and often the story mode will branch out into several paths. Most missions involve killing all of the enemies, but other missions include stealing a package, retrieving a hostage, defending a location. Missions typically have a difficulty and alarm rating, some missions will automatically fail if the alarm is sounded. In a mission, characters have a certain number of action points (APs). Most actions (shooting weapons, opening doors) cost 1 AP, whereas some moves can consume more. Characters can get injured, and a severe injury will automatically fail the mission. The music for the game was composed by Bill Brown. Reception The game received mixed reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. Christian A. O'Brien of Next Generation said in an early review, \\"Unless you want to trudge through medieval technology and game play, pass right on by Shadow Watch.

By their life and activities, they assist the Church in her efforts to form Christian communities whose center of life is the Eucharist. They commit themselves to the implementation of this ideal in collaboration with lay men and women engaged in various ministries. History The Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament, was founded in Paris, France, on May 13, 1856, by a French priest, Saint Peter Julian Eymard. As he searched for a response to the needs and challenges of his time, he found the answer in the love of God manifested in a special way in the Eucharist. During Eymard's lifetime, the character of French Catholicism was changing from a religion of guilt and fear to a religion based on God's mercy and love. Eymard was a leading figure in this transition. Founder ‚Äì St. Peter Julian Eymard St. Peter Julian Eymard Eymard was born February 4, 1811, at La Mure, Is√®re, France. He was a contemporary and friend of Peter Chanel, John Vianney, Marcellin Champagnat, and the sculptor, Auguste Rodin. On July 20, 1834, Eymard was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Grenoble, and in 1839 he joined the Marist Fathers. He worked with the Third Order of Mary and other lay organizations promoting devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary and to the Eucharist, particularly the Forty Hours Devotion. Insignia of the Sacramentinos Eymard became familiar with the practice of sustained eucharistic worship during a visit to Paris in 1849, when he met with members of the Association of Nocturnal Adorers who had established exposition and perpetual adoration of the Blessed Sacrament at the Basilica of Our Lady of Victories. Eymard, with permission from the Paris bishops, on May 13, 1856, left the Marist order and founded the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament for men. The first community was established at 114 rue d‚ÄôEnfer, Paris. In 1858 he, along with Marguerite Guillot, founded the Servants of the Blessed Sacrament, a contemplative congregation for women. Eymard died on August 1, 1868. He was declared venerable in 1908, beatified in 1925, and canonized by Pope John XXIII on December 9, 1962. On December 9, 1995, Saint Peter Julian Eymard, priest, was inserted into the General Roman Calendar with the rank of optional memorial. Eymard's mission in the Church consisted in promoting the centrality of the Eucharistic Mystery in the whole life of the Christian community, as the font and fullness of all evangelization and striking expression of the infinite love of the divine Redeemer for humankind. Since the Holy Eucharist clearly marked the life and pastoral activity of Peter Julian Eymard, he is known as an outstanding apostle of the Eucharist. The Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament began working with children in Paris to prepare them to receive their First Communion. It also reached out to non-practicing Catholics, inviting them to repent and begin receiving Communion again. In 1859 he opened a second community at Marseilles and placed in charge of it his first companion, Fr. Raymond De Cuers. A third foundation was established at Antwerp and two others at Brussels, along with a formation house or novitiate at Saint-Maurice in the Diocese of Versailles. Eucharistic charism Members of the Congregation believe that Christ in the Eucharist has the power to effect a radical transformation in the society and in all people, motivating and strengthening everyone to work for the establishment of Christ's Kingdom on earth. Each religious proclaims the reality of God's love in the Eucharist by his \\"gift of self\\" to Him and his brothers and sisters. By prayer in the presence of the Blessed Sacrament and an active apostolic life, he strives to make Christ in the Eucharist better known and loved. Eymard was a tireless proponent of frequent Holy Communion, an idea given more authoritative backing by Pope Pius X in 1905. Mission Logo of the Sacramentinos Following in the footsteps of Eymard, the mission of the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament is \\"to respond to the hungers of the human family with the riches of God's love manifested in the Eucharist.\\" Conscious of a call to bear prophetic witness to the Eucharist, members of the Congregation commit themselves to the renewal of Church and society through this sacrament, especially by gathering communities characterized by hospitality, reconciliation, and service; and celebrating the Eucharist as the source and summit of the life of the Church. By their lives and activities, they share in the mission of the Church, so that the Eucharist may be celebrated in truth, that the faithful may grow in their communion with the Lord through Eucharistic adoration in the setting of solemn exposition, that they may commit themselves to the renewal of their Christian communities, and collaborate in liberating individuals and society from the forces of evil. United in Spirit with those who are poor and weak, they oppose everything which degrades human dignity and they proclaim a more just and brotherly world as they await the coming of the Lord. The Congregation today Since its founding, the members of the congregation have reached all continents of the globe and continue the mission begun by St. Peter Julian Eymard. Currently numbering a little less than a thousand religious, they are present in thirty different countries throughout the world.

Borrowing from the business-world concept of the independent contractor or franchise, WTB trains \\"Associate Instructors\\" who then \\"manage their own local ministry\\" and interface with churches and private schools in their region to present the various WTB multimedia seminars. WTB's original goal was to train and equip one instructor for every 50,000 people, in every country of the world. More recently, this goal has been augmented with an effort to establish instructors connected to local churches in 1,000 high- density cities in various countries. WTB is reported to have trained over 100,000 instructors. After becoming a best-selling author, Wilkinson stepped down from leadership of WTB, and was succeeded as president by Chip Ingram in 2003. Ingram was later succeeded by Phil Tuttle, the current president. Awards At the National Religious Broadcasters' 2007 Annual Media Awards, WTB won an award for \\"Best Ministry Website\\".

They live mostly in a region known as J√°szs√°g, which comprises the north-western part of J√°sz-Nagykun-Szolnok county. They are sometimes known in English by the exonym Jassic and are also known by the endonyms Iasi and Jassy. They originated as an Ossetian people from Sarmatia. Geography The main church in the center of J√°szber√©ny The cultural and political center of J√°szs√°g is the town of J√°szber√©ny. J√°szs√°g is sometimes, erroneously, known as \\"Jazygia\\", after a somewhat related Sarmatian people, the Iazyges, who lived in a similar area in ancient times. However, there is no direct connection between the J√°sz and Iazyges. History The Jasz people were a nomadic Sarmatian (or Scythian) tribe which settled in the medieval Kingdom of Hungary during the 13th centuryFrederik Coene, The Caucasus: an introduction, Taylor & Francis, 2009, p. 219 and are generally thought to be of Ossetian origin originally speaking a dialect of the Ossetic language. The dialect is extinct and members of the J√°sz nowadays usually speak Hungarian. Their name is almost certainly related to that of the Iazyges, one of the Sarmatian tribes which, along with the Roxolani, reached the borders of Dacia during the late 1st century BC (the city of Ia»ôi is named for them). Residual elements of these tribes, ancestors of the Jasz people, remained behind in the central North Caucasus, mingling with Caucasian peoples to form the present-day Ossetes. The Jasz people came to the Kingdom of Hungary, together with the Cumanians ( people) when their lands to the east, in some in the later Moldavia (see Ia»ôi and Jaszvasar) were invaded by the Mongol Empire in the mid-13th century. They were admitted by the Hungarian king, B√©la IV √Årp√°d, who hoped that the Jaszs would assist in resisting the Mongol-Tatar invasion. Shortly after their entry, the relationship worsened dramatically between the Hungarian nobility and the Cumanian-Jasz tribes, which then abandoned the country. After the end of the Mongol-Tatar invasion they returned and settled in the central part of the Pannonian Plain, near the rivers Zagyva and Tarna. Jazygia (in red-violet) in the eighteenth century within the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary Initially, their main occupation was animal husbandry. During the next two centuries, they were fully assimilated into the Hungarian population; their language disappeared, but they preserved their Jasz identity. The Hungarian rulers granted the Jasz people special privileges. Thus, the Jasz were able to be more or less self-governing in an area known as J√°szs√°g in which J√°szber√©ny developed into the regional, cultural and administrative center. In the 16th‚Äì17th centuries, areas populated by the Jasz people were under Ottoman administration, but at the end of the 17th century they were recaptured and returned to the Kingdom of Hungary, which was then part of the Habsburg Monarchy. Habsburg Emperor Leopold I sold the area to the Knights of the Teutonic Order. This saw the end of the privileged position of J√°szber√©ny. However, the Jasz people did not want to accept this situation and started to collect money with which they could buy their freedom. By 1745, they had collected half a million Rhenish gold florins, a considerable sum for those days. However, in this time the famous 'Act of Redemption' took place: the Empress Maria Theresa restored the Jasz land and Jasz hereditary privileges. From this point onwards, Jaszber√©ny flourished. The Jasz regional autonomy was preserved until the year 1876, when area populated by the Jasz was administratively included into the J√°sz-Nagykun-Szolnok County. Map of J√°szs√°g (Jazygia) J√°szs√°g (Jazygia) within modern Hungary After dissolution of Austria-Hungary in 1918, areas populated by the Jasz people were included into an independent Hungary. Over a dozen settlements in the Great Hungarian Plain (e.g. the names J√°szber√©ny, J√°sz√°roksz√°ll√°s, J√°szf√©nyszaru, J√°szals√≥szentgy√∂rgy) still include a link to the Jasz. In 1995, the 250th Anniversary of the Act of Redemption was celebrated in J√°szber√©ny with the President of Hungary as guest of honor as well as with numerous foreign dignitaries. Language Jassic is the common name in English for the original language of the J√°sz. It is dialect of Ossetian and, therefore, the broader Iranian language family. Jassic became extinct and was replaced by Hungarian. The only literary record of the J√°sz language was found in the 1950s in the Hungarian National Sz√©ch√©nyi Library. The language was reconstructed with the help of various Ossetian analogies.

For most of their history the lineup has been Joseph King (guitar, lead vocals), Julian Mandrake (lead guitar), Ben Rada (rhythm guitar), Brad Byram (bass, backing vocals), and Scott Thomas (drums). The band was extremely popular and influential on the Texas music scene, and the members of the band have all gone on to join or form other successful bands. History The roots of Canvas began in San Francisco in 1993 with singer- songwriter Joseph King and drummer Jean-Paul \\"JP\\" Labrosse, who were both members of Stanford Talisman. They decided to form a band, which they called Driftwood, and recruited bassist Bret Mohley, who Joseph knew through the local music scene, and guitarist Ben Rada who Joseph had met by chance at a coffee shop. The band recorded their first demos under the name Labrosse King, but by 1996 they had renamed themselves Canvas. They released a self-titled EP in 1998. Mohley was eventually replaced by Geoff Piper. In 1999, Canvas played the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas and became so enamored with the city that they decided to move there. They added established Austin musicians Julian Mandrake (formerly of Oynxx and Brother Love) on lead guitar and Scott Thomas (formerly of Dexter Freebish) on drums. Brad Byram (formerly of Ugly Tribe and Zen Merchants) soon replaced Geoff Piper on bass, rounding out the band with King on vocals and Rada on rhythm guitar. Immediately after recruiting the new members, the band began work on their first full-length album Invocation, which they recorded and produced in their garage. While in California, the band had a light rock sound which drew comparisons to Matchbox Twenty, Live and Counting Crows. When the band moved to Texas, they quickly made friends with bands such as Johnny Goudie, Spoonfed Tribe and Blue October and found a new harder-edged sound influenced by their musical peers. Invocation's two singles, \\"In These Walls\\" and \\"Sirens,\\" were added into regular rotation at Austin's KLBJ-FM and climbed to No. 1 most requested and top 5 phones within a week, and stayed at the top for two months. The station also included a live version of Canvas's song \\"Lessons From Underneath the Kachina Woman's Skirt\\" as the opening track of their 2002 Local Licks Live compilation. The group built a large cult following due to their raucous concerts, which often included fire dancing, a practice they had to abandon in 2003 after clubs imposed tighter restrictions following The Station nightclub fire. After the recording of their 2004 album Four Days Awake rhythm guitarist Ben Rada left the band, and Joseph King assumed rhythm guitar duties as well as lead vocals on the Four Days Awake tour. During the 2005 tour supporting their third album Painting the Roses drummer Tabber Millard filled in for Scott Thomas, and the album's producer, Johnny Goudie, took over keyboard duties, a role previously filled by Rada. Johnny Goudie also served as opening act on the tour, with Canvas as his backing band. Canvas played an emotional three-hour farewell show at Antone's in Austin on October 1, 2005. During the show former Canvas rhythm guitarist Ben Rada joined the band for the song \\"In these Walls\\" and Johnny Goudie joined the band to sing \\"Intertwined,\\" a song that he co-wrote with the band. Canvas had played well over five hundred concerts all across the United States prior to going on hiatus. When asked if the band were breaking up, Byram said that the band were like an old married couple who have decided to take separate vacations. Hiatus In early 2006 Joseph King and Scott Thomas along with former Billy Idol guitarist Mark Younger-Smith formed the band Murder My Sweet, which was well received at the South by Southwest Festival in Spring 2006. King has since left the project and moved to New York where he is pursuing a solo career and fronting the bands Deadbeat Darling and Mad Crush. After his break from Canvas in the spring of 2004, Ben Rada split time between audio engineering gigs for Austin clubs and traveling the states as a sideman with Austin local legend Bob Schneider. He now resides in the San Francisco Bay Area. Julian Mandrake has a new band, Mother's Anthem, and was also a touring guitarist for Blue October in 2006 and 2007 and took over as lead guitarist from 2010 to 2012. Brad Byram was bassist in Austin's The Wartime Social, Blondes Make Better Victims and Johnny Goudie and the Little Champions. In 2019 he moved to Nashville, Tennessee. Scott Thomas drums for Johnny Goudie and the Little Champions and Murder My Sweet. After Canvas he moved to Dallas and became a lawyer, but still plays drums. Tabber Millard drummed for SouthFM until their 2007 split, and has also been a member of VAST, Blondes Make Better Victims, Bekah Kelso, and Alpha Rev. He was also a member of Anuhea's touring band. Geoff Piper is a member of the band Pinpoint Mercy and also fronts the Geoff Piper Band. Reunions Canvas reunited for one show on January 28, 2006 at Momo's Club in Austin, Texas. A second reunion show for June 2006 was planned, but was cancelled due to Julian Mandrake's obligations to Blue October's Foiled tour. On September 29, 2007 The Wartime Social, Mother's Anthem, Johnny Goudie and the Little Champions and Deadbeat Darling all played a show at Momo's Club. At the conclusion of Deadbeat Darling's set, all the members of Canvas, including Ben Rada and Tabber Millard took the stage and played \\"In these Walls\\", \\"All About You\\" and \\"Four Days Awake.\\" On April 12, 2013 Canvas reunited and played a full concert at the historic Scoot Inn in Austin, Texas. Later in 2013 the band reunited at the new Antone's location in Austin to play a Christmas concert on December 20 with Vallejo and Podunk. The band announced another reunion show to take place August 21, 2014. In August 2018 Canvas announced another reunion concert to take place October 27, 2018 with SouthFM and A+ Machines. In an interview on KLBJ-FM, Brad Bryam insisted the band never said they were breaking up, that they have merely been on hiatus. He joked that their periodic reunion shows have been referred to as their \\"annual last show ever.\\" Members * Joseph King ‚Äì Guitar/vocals * Ben Rada ‚Äì Guitar/Piano * Julian Mandrake ‚Äì Guitar * Brad Byram ‚Äì Bass/vocals * Scott Thomas ‚Äì Drums Touring Members * Tabber Millard ‚Äì Drums, Percussion, Backing Vocals * Johnny Goudie - Keyboard, Percussion, Backing Vocals Discography * Canvas 1998 (EP) * Invocation 2001 * Four Days Awake 2004 * Painting the Roses 2005 Timeline ImageSize = width:1000 height:300 PlotArea = left:100 bottom:60 top:0 right:50 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/01/1993 till:31/12/2018 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Colors = id:vocals value:red legend:Lead_Vocals id:guitar value:brightgreen legend:Guitar id:drums value:orange legend:Drums id:bass value:blue legend:Bass id:lguitar value:green legend:Lead_Guitar id:Lines value:black legend:Albums Legend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom ScaleMajor = increment:2 start:1993 ScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1993 BarData = bar:Joseph text:\\"Joseph King\\" bar:Jean text:\\"Jean-Paul Labrosse\\" bar:Bret text:\\"Bret Mobley\\" bar:Ben text:\\"Ben Rada\\" bar:Geoff text:\\"Geoff Piper\\" bar:Scott text:\\"Scott Thomas\\" bar:Julian text:\\"Julian Mandrake\\" bar:Brad text:\\"Brad Byram\\" bar:Tabber text:\\"Tabber Millard\\" PlotData= width:10 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4) bar:Joseph from:01/01/1993 till:02/10/2005 color:guitar width:3 bar:Joseph from:13/01/2006 till:13/02/2006 color:guitar width:3 bar:Joseph from:01/09/2007 till:01/10/2007 color:guitar width:3 bar:Joseph from:01/04/2013 till:01/05/2013 color:guitar width:3 bar:Joseph from:01/12/2013 till:31/12/2013 color:guitar width:3 bar:Joseph from:01/08/2014 till:01/09/2014 color:guitar width:3 bar:Joseph from:27/10/2018 till:28/11/2018 color:guitar width:3 bar:Joseph from:01/01/1993 till:02/10/2005 color:vocals bar:Joseph from:13/01/2006 till:13/02/2006 color:vocals bar:Joseph from:01/09/2007 till:01/10/2007 color:vocals bar:Joseph from:01/04/2013 till:01/05/2013 color:vocals bar:Joseph from:01/12/2013 till:31/12/2013 color:vocals bar:Joseph from:01/08/2014 till:01/09/2014 color:vocals bar:Joseph from:27/10/2018 till:28/11/2018 color:vocals bar:Jean from:01/01/1993 till:31/12/1998 color:drums bar:Bret from:01/01/1993 till:01/01/1998 color:bass bar:Ben from:01/06/1993 till:31/12/2004 color:guitar bar:Ben from:01/10/2005 till:01/11/2005 color:guitar bar:Ben from:01/09/2007 till:01/10/2007 color:guitar bar:Geoff from:01/01/1998 till:31/12/1999 color:bass bar:Brad from:01/01/2000 till:05/10/2005 color:bass bar:Brad from:13/01/2006 till:13/02/2006 color:bass bar:Brad from:01/09/2007 till:01/10/2007 color:bass bar:Brad from:01/04/2013 till:01/05/2013 color:bass bar:Brad from:01/12/2013 till:31/12/2013 color:bass bar:Brad from:01/08/2014 till:01/09/2014 color:bass bar:Brad from:27/10/2018 till:28/11/2018 color:bass bar:Julian from:01/01/1999 till:05/10/2005 color:lguitar bar:Julian from:13/01/2006 till:13/02/2006 color:lguitar bar:Julian from:01/09/2007 till:01/10/2007 color:lguitar bar:Julian from:01/04/2013 till:01/05/2013 color:lguitar bar:Julian from:01/12/2013 till:31/12/2013 color:lguitar bar:Julian from:01/08/2014 till:01/09/2014 color:lguitar bar:Julian from:27/10/2018 till:28/11/2018 color:lguitar bar:Tabber from:01/05/2005 till:20/09/2005 color:drums bar:Tabber from:01/09/2007 till:01/10/2007 color:drums bar:Tabber from:27/10/2018 till:28/11/2018 color:drums bar:Scott from:01/01/1999 till:02/10/2005 color:drums bar:Scott from:13/01/2006 till:13/02/2006 color:drums bar:Scott from:01/09/2007 till:01/10/2007 color:drums bar:Scott from:01/04/2013 till:01/05/2013 color:drums bar:Scott from:01/12/2013 till:31/12/2013 color:drums bar:Scott from:01/08/2014 till:01/09/2014 color:drums bar:Scott from:27/10/2018 till:28/11/2018 color:drums LineData = at:01/05/2001 color:black layer:back at:09/03/2004 color:black layer:back at:01/05/2005 color:black layer:back at:15/06/1998 color:black layer:back References External links Official sites * https://www.facebook.com/canvasaustin Musical groups from Austin, Texas Alternative rock groups from Texas Musical groups established in 1993 Musical groups disestablished in 2005 1998 establishments in Texas ","title":"Canvas (band)"},{"id":"6482095","text":"Process Media is an independent publishing house, the result of a collaboration between Adam Parfrey of Feral House and Jodi Wille of Dilettante Press, founded in 2005 and headquartered in Port Townsend.

He represents House District 83, which includes Germantown, Bartlett, Cordova and portions of East Memphis. White was formerly second vice-chairman of the Shelby County Republican Party. He was the Republican nominee for U.S. Congress in Tennessee's 9th congressional district in the 2006 election. White's opponents in the general election were Democrat Steve Cohen and independent Jake Ford. It was White's first bid for elected office. Many pundits believed that White faced nearly impossible odds in November. The 9th is a heavily Democratic, majority-African-American district which has been in Democratic hands since 1975; the Republicans have not made a truly serious bid for the seat since 1978. In addition, the 9th's incumbent congressman, Harold Ford, Jr., was running for the Senate, and popular Governor Phil Bredesen was running for a second term. For much of the campaign, it seemed the real race was between Cohen and Ford. However, the 9th is so heavily Democratic that White would have faced very long odds even in a two-man race against Cohen. Despite being the highest-profile Republican to run in the 9th in almost 30 years, White was badly outspent, raising just over $227,000. In November, White placed third with 18 percent of the vote, well behind Cohen (60 percent) and Ford (22 percent). This was by far the worst showing for a Republican in the district since the 1950s. He supported Rick Perry for Republican primary of the 2012 presidential election.J.R.

Brian Kelsey, the then- Representative from Tennessee's 83rd State House District, resigned his post in September 2009 to run for the seat. A special election was triggered, with the primary to occur on December 1, the same day as the election to fill the Senate seat. Mark White won the primary in a three-candidate field, and went on to face Democrat Guthrie Castle and Independent John Andreucetti in the General Election on January 12, 2010. The final results had White leading by a very comfortable margin in the extremely low turnout election. , White was elected to a full term in the seat later in 2010.

Durham) was an English art collector and thoroughbred racehorse owner who founded the Bowes Museum in Barnard Castle, Teesdale. Bowes Museum Family background Born into the wealthy coal mining descendants of George Bowes, he was the child of John Lyon-Bowes, 10th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne (1769‚Äì1820) and his mistress or common-law wife Mary Millner, later wife of Sir William Hutt. His paternal grandmother was Mary Bowes, Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne. Because his parents were unmarried at the time of his birth,According to Augustus Hare, Strathmore went through a secret and false ceremony of marriage with Mary Millner to persuade her to live with him, and only revealed on his deathbed (in 1820) that he had never actually married her. Lord Hardwicke's Marriage Act (1753) made common-law marriages legally invalid for the first time in British history; thus by English law, Strathmore and Millner were never married. If the pair had been domiciled in Scotland, the fact that Strathmore and Millner had lived together as man and wife would have been sufficient to establish a marriage. Hare claims that young John Bowes was enrolled at Eton as Lord Glamis. he did not inherit the Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne title. All sources describe Bowes as the fully and openly acknowledged son of the 10th Earl. 1820 legitimacy case The shell of Gibside Hall His parents married at St George's, Hanover Square on 2 July 1820, with Lord Barnard, heir to the Earl of Darlington, as witness. 16 hours later, his father died. Bowes's legitimacy was questioned by the 10th Earl's next surviving brother Thomas Bowes, who claimed the earldom and estates for himself. The Scottish courts agreed that the 1820 marriage had taken place, and that it had been between two unmarried persons. However, since his parents were not domiciled in Scotland (the crucial point of the uncle's challenge), he was not legitimated in Scotland.Scottish private law on legitimation by subsequent marriage, which was based on Roman law, required that the parties be free to marry at the time of their child's birth (which condition was fulfilled), and that the parties be domiciled in Scotland (which condition was not fulfilled). Since then, Scottish law on legitimation has been changed by the Legitimation (Scotland) Act 1968. This law would now permit even children born to adulterous parents who subsequently marry to be legitimated; see the case of Drumlanrig in 1973. The result was to make John Bowes officially illegitimate under English and Scottish law, which status came to matter more and more in the Victorian mores already coming into effect. A five-year battle ensued over the estates, with the English estates going to John and the Scottish estates going to his uncle, the 11th Earl. Bowes was raised at Gibside by his mother, now Dowager Countess of Strathmore. In 1831, she married his tutor William Hutt (1791‚Äì1882) as his first wife. Subsequent career Educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, John Bowes pursued an interest in theatre, art, and horse racing. A member of the Jockey Club, he owned Streatlam Stud that bred and raised racehorses at Streatlam and Gibside. His stable won the 2,000 Guineas Stakes three times, The Derby four times, and, in capturing the English Triple Crown with West Australian, won the 1853 St. Leger Stakes. Bowes was a reformer in politics, in favour of triennial Parliaments and the removal of Bishops from the House of Lords. He was a Liberal Party Member of Parliament, for the South Durham constituency, between 1832 and 1847. He also served as High Sheriff of Durham in 1852. As one of the largest landowners in England, he developed a number of business interests, initially concerning his extensive coal mine holdings. Charles Mark Palmer managed his collieries at Marley Hill and later opened the Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company at Jarrow, in which Bowes was a partner. The first major vessel built was the pioneer iron steam collier John Bowes. Marriage Bowes left England for France, allegedly because he was not fully welcome in Victorian society as a person of illegitimate birth. While in Paris, France, John Bowes met the actress Jos√©phine Beno√Æte Coffin-Chevallier (1825‚Äì1874), daughter of a clockmaker, a woman passionate about painting and collecting. She apparently became his mistress, and they married in 1852. For a time, the couple made their home at the Ch√¢teau du Barry in Louveciennes near Paris. They shared a passion for art and acquired a large collection that would ultimately be housed in the Bowes Museum. In 1868, she became Countess of Montalbo, San Marino. Unfortunately both died before their museum project was completed, Josephine having died in 1874. She had no issue, and was buried at Gibside. Foundation of the Bowes Museum Jos√©phine had lain the foundation stone of the museum on 27 November 1869, but she was apparently too ill to actually lay the foundation stone and merely touched it with a trowel. The story of John Bowes is told in the book John Bowes and the Bowes Museum by Charles E Hardy. The book itself has an interesting history. It was first published by the renowned Newcastle upon Tyne publisher Frank Graham in 1970. The second printing in 1978 was again published by Frank Graham, but two subsequent editions, 1982 and 1989, were published by The Friends of Bowes Museum. Second marriage and death In 1877 (marriage settlement 24 July 1877), Bowes remarried one Alphonsine Maria St. Amand, divorced wife of the Comte de Courten.Durham Country records: Ref D/HH 5/1/105. The second marriage did not turn out well, and it appears that John Bowes was attempting to obtain a divorce from his wife from March to May 1884. Indeed, it was subsequently reported to have been legally severed in May 1885. Alphonsine may have been mother of the Italian artist Angelo de Courten (1848‚Äì1925).Durham County Records: Strathmore Estate letters from Alphonsine Bowes to the Earl of Strathmore. She was preparing to leave Biarritz for London, presumably to answer charges brought against her. Bowes died childless in October 1885 at Streatlam, and was interred next to his first wife at Gibside. It had been intended that they would be reinterred in a Catholic chapel at the Bowes Museum, but this was never completed. Will, bequests, and legacy Bowes's will left his wife Alphonsine an annuity of ¬£3000 for life, as well as ¬£20,000.Durham County records: Ref D/HH 5/1/96 Substantial sums were left to his curator Amelie Basset,Some websites give her name as Amelie Basset, the daughter of his old dealer friend who had died the same year as Josephine. He had known her since she was twelve years old. The Bowes Museum says that she inherited her father's business and > in 1875 (one year after the death of Jos√©phine) John Bowes asked her to look > after the Collection that was to be housed at the Bowes Museum in England. > Am√©lie was responsible for the cleaning and repair of all the paintings in > store, and supervising everything in the Temporary Gallery in France before > organising the shipment of cases to Barnard Castle. Her important role was > reflected in John's will when he died: he left her ¬£9000 [sic]! Amelie was therefore Bowes's Curator and one of the beneficiaries of his will, but not his second wife (as stated by some online sources). This is confirmed by the Durham County records which summarise the will dated 1878, where Amelie Basset, picture dealer, of 7 Rue Mansart, Paris, is left ¬£5,000 (contradicting the Bowes Museum statement of ¬£9000). and to his three named godchildren. The remainder of his estate, not entailed, was largely devised to the trustees of his first wife's will (registered 1875) for the purposes of setting up the Museum. By the terms of his father's entailment, his English properties reverted to his legitimate cousins upon his death. Streatlam Castle was eventually sold by the family in 1922 on the eve of the wedding of Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon to the Duke of York, allegedly to pay for the costs of the wedding. It passed through many hands, and was demolished by its new owner Philip Ivan Pease in 1959, but the Pease family retains the lands till date. The Gibside estate is now owned by the National Trust. John Bowes is best remembered today as the founder of the Bowes Museum, which has been described as the Wallace Collection of the North. The comparison might be deliberate; both men were the acknowledged sons of their fathers, wealthy peers; both lived in France for a considerable period; both married French wives, who had been previously their mistresses.

It was founded by Friedrich Speidel in 1867 as a manufacturer of gold and silver chains, and the company was formed in its modern state in the United States in 1904 as 'The Speidel Chain Company'. and very soon was known for its \\"Ratchet-buckle\\" watchbands (introduced in 1920), the \\"Scissors Action Expansion Band\\" (introduced in 1936), the ladies' \\"Mignon\\" watchbands (introduced in 1939), plus costume jewelry. In the 1930s, Speidel was the first company in the world to introduce ID bracelets. During World War II, the company briefly produced cathode-ray tubes. Speidel experienced a boom in popularity, notably with their invention of the hugely popular expanding strap in the mid-1930s, and in addition to watchbands Speidel produced wristwatches, lighters, writing instruments, small jewelry, and other accessories, before beginning to decline by the end of the century with the struggle to compete with cheaper overseas production, and the boom in Quartz watches. History  Early history  Friedrich Speidel founded the Speidel Company in 1867. With an initial investment equivalent to $10, Speidel started making gold and silver chains with his wife, in the basement of his home in Pforzheim, Germany. He has been credited with developing the gold-over-metal method of manufacturing called \\"bi-metal\\" (also incorrectly known as gold \\"plating\\") which proved successful. In 1896 he built the company's first factory, installing state-of-the-art machines for the production of gold chain, previously manufactured entirely by hand. Friedrich Speidel sent his three sons, Albert, Edwin and Eugene to America to establish a branch of the family's jewelry chain manufacturing business. The Speidel Chain Company was officially founded in the United States in 1904. By 1912 the Speidel brothers hired the architectural firm Monks and Johnson to design the company's first headquarters. The five-story building, with its European-style front, was originally called the Doran-Speidel Building.  Early-mid 1900s and Growth  At first, only chain was made in the new facilities. During the 1920s, costume jewelry and watchbands were added to the line. Men's watchbands surged in popularity due to their introduction and use in the military during World War I. In the early 1920s Albert Speidel formed Speidel Brothers, producing watch bracelets that were manufactured and sold primarily to wholesalers.http://www.speidel.com/default.cfm?PID=1.3.1 In 1928 the Speidel family in Germany and the brothers who lived in the United States, decided to merge all of the businesses into the Speidel Corporation in order to strengthen their position. The first president of Speidel Corporation was Albert Speidel, one of the Speidel brothers living in Providence, Rhode Island. In 1934 Paul Levinger was hired by Speidel Corporation as a plant foreman.  WWII War effort & electronic components.  Watchband production was cut back during World War II when Speidel converted most of its facilities and started manufacturing cathode ray tubes for radar and other electronic applications. However Speidel returned to watchbands as soon as peace returned. In 1947 Speidel brought out its first modernized version of the scissor-type expansion band called the Golden Knight. It proved to be a tremendous success in the men's watch bracelet field. The company also introduced elaborate packaging for its line of watch bracelets.  Expansion and national prominence  A planned reduction of costume jewelry production was soon instituted, leading to the discontinuation of costume jewelry in the early 1950s. National advertising for watch bracelets under the name Speidel and the building of a brand name began after the end of World War II, first in magazines and then in radio with a program called ‚ÄúStop the Music.‚Äù This proved to be an outstanding success and helped make the name of Speidel nationally known. In 1949 Speidel changed with the times and discontinued radio advertising. Instead it concentrated its advertising budget in television, purchasing a number of fully sponsored programs and making Speidel one of the earliest television advertisers in the United States.  Korean War and military manufacturing.  In 1951 with the advent of the Korean War, Speidel began manufacturing identification bracelets. The first product in this category was the Photo Ident, a combination ident bracelet with photo and an expandable wristband, which was advertised on television. It was an immediate success ‚Äì of major proportions. In 1956 Speidel started manufacturing men's jewelry. This was in an attempt to diversify its inventory and combat the increasingly heavy competition in metal watch bracelets from Japanese imports. Heavy opposition to this move by other manufacturers made it necessary for Speidel to change its method of distribution from general jobbers to sole distributors. Over the next three years a number of such sole distributorships were established in strategic geographic locations. Its sales force was also built up to provide adequate coverage to all areas of the United States.  Introduction & Development of the 'Fixo-Flex' bracelet  Around this time, heavy investments had been made in the development of automatic equipment to produce a bracelet similar to the German Fixo-Flex. A few years earlier a German manufacturer had sent the first version of the Fixo-Flex bracelet to Paul Levinger who had worked out a license contract with the inventor, Karl E. Stiegle. In 1956 the first automatically produced bracelet under this patent was introduced as a test under the name of Kingsway. By 1959 the company officially introduced the new watchband as the ‚ÄúTwist-O-Flex‚Äù. Speidel introduced its newest version of the highly successful Twist-O-Flex watchband in 1988, called the Euro- Flex.http://www.speidel.com/default.cfm?PID=1.10 The new watchband incorporated heavier metals and contemporary European styling. Speidel continued to expand its line of products with the introduction of the ‚ÄúSignet‚Äù watch line in 1994; a patented plastic top shell watchband in 1995; and the first watchband with rubberized coating in 1996.  Change of Ownership & International Expansion  By 1964 the company, now owned by Paul Levinger, had grown significantly both in size and importance to the jewelry industry. Levinger sold the company to Textron, Inc. in May of 1964. By 1966 Speidel had expanded its distribution capacity and entered the men's toiletries market, with the introduction of the men's fragrance British Sterling. The company aggressively marketed the product with such enduring phrases as, ‚ÄúMake him a legend in his own time,‚Äù which helped to create a market success without parallel. Speidel became one of Textron's top local divisions in sales volume and performance. The company began to expand its marketing reach internationally in the 1970s, beginning with Canada in 1971. The company furthered its sales market by branching out to Australia and New Zealand in 1972. Great Britain and Ireland in 1973; and Germany, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland in 1974.  Later period (late 1900s)   Period of decline, bankruptcy and rebirth.  In the midst of their international sales expansion, Speidel started OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturing) Business Supplies in 1972. OEM manufactured outsourced metal watchbands for watch companies such as Seiko, which at the time had just introduced the ‚Äúquartz‚Äù watch, the first totally machine assembled timepiece, which dramatically reduced watch prices. That same year Speidel began its watchband replacement program for mass merchandisers, making it much easier for consumers to find the appropriately sized watchband replacement at their local store. In 1997 Textron sold Speidel to the Austrian-based Hirsch Armb√§nder AG, a leading manufacturer of leather watchbands in Europe. The new company was Hirsch Speidel Inc. Two years later, as part of a global manufacturing consolidation strategy, Hirsh closed Speidel's original Ship Street property and relocated its headquarters to East Providence. In coordination with the move, Speidel closed down its manufacturing operations and outsourced its workload. A portion of the production continued in Rhode Island with local manufacturing companies, and the balance moved overseas. In 2002 the company's ownership had once again returned to the United States, when JRM holdings bought Speidel from Hirsch Armb√§nder. Five years later Fred Levinger (Son of Paul Levinger) acquired Speidel. In 2009 Cerce Capital LLC, purchased Speidel's assets for $US 1.65 million in a bankruptcy proceedings.\\"Speidel Assets Sold for $1.65 Million,\\" Michelle Graf, Idexonline.com, from National Jeweler Network, accessed 2 Feb 2018 Speidel has now been revived as a brand, and sells old and new watch strap lines.  The Speidel Family  In 1937 Albert Speidel died at an early age from pneumonia. His brother Edwin, the founder of the Automatic Chain Company who had not been active in the Speidel Corporation up to this time became president of Speidel Corporation and Paul Levinger was made vice-president. At that time, the majority control of the business was held by the German family. However, in 1939, all of the shares held by the German stockholders were purchased by Edwin Speidel and Paul Levinger.

Fitton was rumoured to have left the music industry in November 2007, but in 2017 he released the album D.E.G. Biography Fitton loaned equipment to Autechre in their early days and his first noteworthy involvement with electronic music was as assistant on their debut album Incunabula. His own first electronic music release came in 1994, on Warp's Artificial Intelligence II compilation. In 1995 he returned with the now more familiar Bola moniker, releasing the 1 12\\" on Skam Records. In 1996, he recorded the album Plink with Dennis Bourne and Wayne Edwards as Brahma. However, Fitton left the band to pursue his career as Bola. He and Dennis would later collaborate again on the tracks \\"Mauver\\" and \\"Pae Paoe\\". The debut album as Bola, Soup, came in 1998 and was described as \\"an impressive synthesis of the machine-beat ambiance (sic) of post-techno with warm, wistful analog soul\\". A rare set of 3 EPs called Shapes was released in 2000, pressed at only 300 copies; in September 2006, it was remastered and reissued in greater numbers by Skam, adding three bonus tracks. On 2 January 2013, Fitton addressed the rumours of his retirement, stating \\"I figure 5 years of relative inactivity is an adequate musical absence. New music will be produced and released this year.\\" The latest Bola album, D.E.G. - short for Darrell Earnest is Gone  was issued in 2017. There have been occasional live performances, the most recent of which was in December 2012 at Adapter's Vertigo IV in Eindhoven.

It traverses the western section of the Cascade Range within Snohomish County. The name suggests it forms a full loop, but it only is a small portion of a loop, which is completed using State Routes 92, 9, and 530. Part of the highway is also a designated and signed Forest Highway, and is known as Forest Route 20. The highway connects the towns of Granite Falls and Darrington. It is paved for from Granite Falls to Barlow Pass (2349') where the highway becomes unpaved for , and then paved again for the remaining to Darrington. The unpaved section is U.S. Forest Service Road #20 and passes several USFS campgrounds. Portions of the unpaved section are often closed for periods of several years due to flood damage. Between Granite Falls and Barlow Pass, the highway passes Big Four Mountain and the trailhead leading to the Big Four Ice Caves at its base. At Barlow Pass, a gravel road maintained by Snohomish County (closed to motor vehicles) branches from the highway and leads to the former silver mining town of Monte Cristo. The portion from Granite Falls to Barlow Pass follows the Stillaguamish River. The portion from Barlow Pass to Darrington follows the Sauk River. The \\"inside\\" of the highway's namesake loop is a large area containing significant Cascade peaks, including Three Fingers (6850 ft, 2088 m), Whitehorse Mountain (6850 ft, 2088 m), Mount Dickerman (5723 ft, 1744 m), and Mount Forgotten (6005 ft, 1830 m). Route description Paved segment 1 Barlow Pass, near the end of the first paved section The Mountain Loop Highway starts at the eastern end of SR 92 in Downtown Granite Falls. Within Downtown Granite Falls, SR 92 is called E Stanley Street and the Mountain Loop Highway is known called N Alder Street. The highway goes north away from Granite Falls and turns east at the point where the road meets the South Fork of the Stillaguamish River. From there, the road roughly follows the river and intersects some Forest Routes such as FR 4201, FR 4018, FR 4020, FR 4037, FR 4052, and FR 4059 while traversing the communities of Robe, Verlot, and Silverton before the river ends. The loop continues and intersects a private road that connects the highway to the Old Monte Cristo Townsite, which is located 4 miles east of Barlow Pass. Unpaved segment At Barlow Pass, the Mountain Loop Highway goes north, and becomes unpaved Forest Route 20 or FR 20. Shortly after becoming unpaved, FR 20 starts to follow the Sauk River towards Darrington. FR 20 goes northward past Bedal, and it becomes paved again at the new Whitechuck bridge (approximately mile marker 44). White Chuck Mountain seen from designated pullout along the highway Paved segment 2 From Whitechuck, the Mountain Loop Highway continues north along the Sauk River. On the opposite side of the river, the N. Sauk River Road (Forest Route 22) parallels the route of the Mountain Loop Highway. The loop enters Darrington, where Railroad Avenue splits from the highway to become a short bypass to the eastern end of the highway. The highway ends at SR 530. History The Mountain Loop Highway was established on March 23, 1936. Before the highway was built, primitive and very rough wagon roads connected the Monte Cristo Townsite with the small towns of Darrington and Granite Falls. A narrow wagon road, known as Wilmans Trail or Pioneer Trail, or simply the Sauk wagon road, was built from Sauk City on the Skagit River to Monte Cristo in 1891. That same year, the surveyor M.Q. Barlow discovered the feasibility of access to Monte Cristo via the South Fork Stillaguamish River. Mining interests funded a wagon road from Silverton to the Sauk wagon road via Barlow Pass. These roads roughly followed the current route of the Mountain Loop Highway along with some railroads. Construction of the road started in 1936 and finished in 1941. The road was closed in 1942 due to the World War II. The highway closes mostly in the winter due to floods and reopens in the spring of the following year, but a windstorm in 2003 closed the highway. With other windstorms following in 2006 and 2007, the highway had to be closed until 2008. The Mountain Loop Highway officially reopened on June 25, 2008, and the cities along the full loop (Arlington, Granite Falls, and Darrington) had a large celebration.

It is the game from which Tien Len and other similar games are derived. Rules Cards The game uses a standard 54-card deck, with thirteen cards in four suits plus two jokers, one red and one black. Diamond is the lowest suit, followed by clubs, then hearts, then spade. Like Big Two, twos rank high, and the rest of the deck ranks as usual: aces above kings, kings above queens, and so on, with threes being the lowest. The Jokers are the highest singles, and the red joker ranks higher than the black joker. Two decks may be used for four or more players. Valid Combinations Cards may be played as singles, pairs, three of a kind, full house, four of a kind, straights (5 or more in a row), straight flushes (5 or more in a row of the same suit), pair straights, and three of a kind straights. The leading card to a trick sets down the type of play. The combinations and their rankings are as follows. * Single cards: Any card from the deck, ordered by rank with suit being the tie-breaker. (For instance, Ace of Spades will beat the Ace of Diamonds, which will beat the King of Spades.) The red Joker is the highest single. * Pairs: Any two cards of matching rank, ordered as with singular cards by the card of the higher suit. (A pair consisting of the King of Spades and the King of Diamonds will beat a pair consisting of the King of Hearts and the King of Clubs.) * Two [or more] pairs: Any number of pairs of cards with consecutive rank, e.g. 5-5-6-6, 5-5-6-6-7-7 * Three of a kind: Any three cards of matching rank. * Full House: A composite of a three-of-a-kind combination and a pair. Ordered by the rank of the triple, regardless of the pair. * Straight: Any five or more cards in a row. Twos are low in a straight (so K-A-2-3-4 is not valid, but 2-3-4-5-6 is), and Aces can be played high or low. A-2-3-4-5 is the lowest straight. If a [x] card straight is the current play type, it is only possible to beat it with another [x] card straight with a higher-number lowest card. * Bomb: Any four cards of matching rank plus one of any card. Can be played on all tricks except higher bombs (i.e. the four same cards having a higher value) or straight flushes. (see Bomb variation) * Straight Flush: Any five or more cards in a row of the same suit. Same rules apply as a straight. A straight flush can be played on any tricks except for a higher straight flush [see straight]. * Jokers: Jokers may only be played as singles, with the red joker ranking higher than the black joker. Dealing and Playing The dealer (who may be chosen by cutting the cards, as usual) shuffles the deck to begin with and begins dealing out the cards singly, starting with himself, in a clockwise manner around the table. The cards are dealt out entirely. At the beginning of the first game, the player with the 3 of diamonds starts. The three of diamonds does not need to be played in the first play. Play proceeds clockwise, with normal climbing-game rules applying: each player must play a higher card or combination than the one before, with the same number of cards. Players may also pass, thus declaring that he does not want to play (or does not hold the necessary cards to make a play possible). A pass does not hinder any further play in the game, each being independent. When all but one of the players have passed in succession the trick is over, and the cards are gathered up and a new trick is started by the last player to play. When a player plays the red joker as a singleton or the 2 of spades as part of a pair of 2s, it is often customary for that player to restart play immediately by leading a new card or combination, since the red joker cannot be beaten as a singleton, nor the pair of 2s, and the passes are mere formalities (except in the rare cases of another player having a bomb). End Game The game continues until the Winner and Loser have been determined, the Winner is the first person to play all their cards, the Loser is the player still holding cards when everyone else is out. After a Winner and Loser are established, the Loser must shuffle and deal out the next game. In one variation, the Loser must then give their highest card to the Winner in exchange for one card out of two cards of the Winner's choosing. The cards exchanged will be shown to the other players. Scoring Scoring varies from place to place, and it is rare to keep score. The most common version is that after a game each player with cards remaining scores -1 point for each, unless they have 10 or more remaining, in which they score -2 for each. If they didn't get to play any cards at all, they score -3 for each. Then the winner of the hand scores +1 for every -1 his opponents got. (So, for example, if North won, and East, West, and South respectively still had 3, 11, and 8 cards left, East would score -3, West would score -22, South would score -8, and North would score +33.) Likewise for a 3-player game, a player with 17 cards remaining is deducted triple points. A player with more than 11 cards and less than 17 cards remaining is deducted double points. Variations * The game can be played with 4 players, after removing the jokers to split a 52-card deck evenly among 4 players. * It can be played that a straight can be higher than another straight by just the suit of the highest card, not requiring a full rank * Bomb: a four of a kind can be played as a bomb. It beats any other play (other than a higher 4 of a kind) * Revolution: a four of a kind makes low cards high and high cards low. (this is not playable with the Bomb variation.)

Apart from chemistry, where one of his most notable publications was on bromination of rubber, he undertook pioneering work in optics and spectroscopy. Biography He was born to John Gladstone, a wholesale draper in Hackney, London and Alison Hall, as the eldest of three sons. The three brothers were educated entirely at home under tutors, and from very early days all showed a strong inclination toward natural science. In 1842 the father retired from business, and the family spent a year in travelling on the continent. Part of this time was passed in Italy with their old friends: Charles Tilt, his wife and their daughter May, who in 1852 became the wife of John Hall Gladstone. From early years Gladstone had shown strong religious tendencies, and when, at the age of seventeen, the question of his future career came to be discussed, he wished to enter the Christian ministry. From this course he was dissuaded both by his father and by Mr. Tilt, and in December 1844 he entered University College, London. Here he attended Graham's lectures on chemistry and worked in his private laboratory, and here he prepared his earliest scientific contribution on \\"Analysis of Sand from St. Michael's Bay, Normandy\\", which was read at a meeting of the Royal Chemical Society on 16 November 1846. Next year, he received a gold medal from the college for his study on \\"Gun Cotton and Xyloidine\\". Later in the same year he went to University of Giessen to work under Justus von Liebig, returning in April 1848 with the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. The subject of his dissertation was possibly \\"Artificial Formation of Urea from Fulminic Acid\\". Although Gladstone had thus formally adopted the pursuit of science as his career, he continued throughout his life to take an active part in religious work. In Clapham his parents were members of the Rev. James Hill's Congregational Church, and here he taught in the Sunday School, beside conducting services in a Mission Room at White Square. Later on he held a Bible Class for young men on Sunday afternoons, and until the end of his life he was intimately connected with the work of the Young Men's Christian Association founded by George Williams. For many years he was the chief organiser of the Sunday afternoon devotional meeting held annually at the meeting of the British Association. In 1850 Gladstone was appointed Lecturer in Chemistry to St. Thomas's Hospital, a post which he held for two years, and in June 1853, at the unusually young age of 26, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1864 he lost his wife, their eldest daughter and only son. This, however, seems to have been followed by only temporary suspense of activity, social and scientific. In 1863‚Äì64 and again in 1866‚Äì68 he served on the Council of the Royal Society, and having been a member of the Royal Commission on Lighthouses, Buoys, and Beacons from 1859 to 1862, he became a member of the Gun Cotton Committee in 1864‚Äì68. In politics Gladstone was a Liberal, and on more than one occasion he was tempted to enter Parliament. In 1868 he unsuccessfully contested the borough of York. In 1869 he married Margaret Thompson King, daughter of the late Rev. Dr. David King, and niece of Lord Kelvin. This lady died in 1870, leaving one daughter. During 1874‚Äì1877, Gladstone held the Fullerian Professorship of Chemistry at the Royal Institution, and was first President of the Physical Society, of which he was one of the founders. He was President of the Chemical Society during 1877‚Äì79, and in 1898 he was one of the six past presidents of that Society who had been Fellows for upwards of fifty years, and in whose honour a banquet was given under the chairmanship of the President, Professor James Dewar. Gladstone was very fond of London and seems never to have wished to live out of the metropolis. He spoke French readily, and frequently attended the summer meetings of the Association Francaise pour l'Avancement des Sciences, and was also at one or two meetings of the Swiss Association. In recognition of his services to education he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the College of Preceptors. He also received the degree Sc.D. at the celebration of the Tercentenary of Trinity College, Dublin, in 1892, and the Davy Medal from the Royal Society in 1897 \\"for his numerous contributions to chemical science, and especially for his important work in the application of optical methods to chemistry\\". In 1880 he became a member of the Company of Wheelwrights, and as a liveryman took part in the last year of his life in the election of the Lord Mayor, at the Guildhall, on Michaelmas Day. On the day of his death, 6 October 1902, he presided in the afternoon at a meeting of the Christian Evidence Society, and, after walking part of the way home, was found lifeless in his study as the result of failure of the heart. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. Research In his early years, Gladstone conducted studies of phosphamide and similar compounds, suggested by Liebig and revised ten years later; an inquiry into the composition of nitrogen iodide (1852). His more important work was published in the Philosophical Transactions in 1855, on \\"Circumstances modifying the Action of chemical Affinity\\". Here, the author examined the question, arising out of the researches of Bunsen and Debus, whether when two substances act on each other an increase in the quantity of one of them leads to a corresponding increase in the amount of chemical change observed, and whether such change occurs continuously or discretely, in atomic proportions. Optical phenomena and the properties of elements and compounds in relation to light have always been a major interest for Gladstone. This comes out quite early in his career, and in a variety of forms. Thus in 1854 he lectured at the Royal Institution on \\"Chromatic Phenomena exhibited by Transmitted Light.\\" In 1855 there were \\"Notes on some substances which exhibit the Phenomena of Fluorescence\\", and in 1856 on \\"Some Dichromatic Phenomena among Solutions\\". In 1858 he drew attention to the use of the prism in qualitative analysis (Quart. Journ. Chem. Soc., 1O, 79), and discovered distinct lines in the absorption spectrum of didymium, a substance long afterwards resolved by Auer von Welsbach into the two elements known as praseodymium and neodymium. A little later he studied the absorption spectrum of the atmosphere, and found that the Fraunhofer lines varied according to the time of day, and that the change must be due to some constituents of the earth's atmosphere. In this research he was joined by Sir David Brewster, and together they produced a paper on the lines of the solar spectrum in 1860. The most important work of Gladstone in this direction was the long series of observations on the refraction and dispersion of liquids, which originated with a study of the \\"Influence of Temperature on the Refraction of Light,\\" (Phil. Trans., 1858) and followed by \\"Researches on the Refraction, Dispersion, and Sensitiveness of Liquids,\\" (Phil. Trans., 1863). Another memorable series of researches commenced about 1872, in conjunction with his assistant Alfred Tribe, resulted in the discovery of the zinc-copper couple, and its application to the production of the organozinc compounds and to other purposes. The couple has long since found its way into every laboratory in the world, and as a reducing agent has met with applications not only in connection with carbon compounds but for many purposes in analysis. Lectures In 1874 and 1876 Gladstone was invited to deliver the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture on The Voltaic Battery and The Chemistry of Fire respectively.

The community is roughly bounded by Lake Ontario to the south, the Rouge River to the east, Port Union Road to the west and Kingston Road to the north. History The area was recorded as being settled as early as 1798, when a crown patent for lots 29, 30, 32 & 33, \\"Con. 1 with the Broken Front, Township of Pickering, County of York and Home District, Province of Upper Canada\\", were granted to William Holmes, Esquire. In 1843 Henry Cowan, an immigrant from Ayr, Scotland, bought lots 32 & 33 from Holmes and settled the land with his family. In 1848 Cowan sold a small portion of his land on the shores of Lake Ontario to the Grand Trunk Railway Company. In 1852 it became part of Ontario County. Rouge Hill GO Station opened in southwestern West Rouge in 1967. In the years following, much of the land was sold. In 1948, the land that is now a housing development between Rouge Hills Dr. and Ridgewood was sold to Rouge Hills Golf and Country Club Limited. The country club and golf course were closed in 1973. In May 1967, Rouge Hill GO Station was opened at the southwestern boundary of West Rouge, providing residents of the neighbourhood access to the GO Transit's commuter rail network. Until 1974 West Rouge was not part of Toronto or Scarborough, but was considered part of the township of Pickering. When Ontario County was reorganized as Durham Region that year, it was transferred to the then-borough of Scarborough under Metropolitan Toronto. Education The neighbourhood is home to several elementary schools operated by two public school boards, the Toronto District School Board (TDSB), and the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB). Prior to the area's annexation by Toronto, the schools in the area were either administered by the Ontario County Board of Education (now Durham District School Board), and the Ontario County Catholic Board (now Durham Catholic District School Board). Following the neighbourhood's annexation in 1976, secular public schools were managed by the Scarborough Board of Education (later merged with TDSB), and the Metro Toronto Separate School Board (later reorganized into TCDSB). The following elementary schools operate in West Rouge (with the managing school board in parenthesis): * Joseph Howe Senior Public School (TDSB)Joseph Howe Sr PS  opened 1977 * St. Brendan Catholic School (TCDSB)St. Brendan Catholic School * West Rouge Junior Public School (TDSB)West Rouge Jr PS  opened 1954 * William G. Davis Junior Public School (TDSB)William G Davis Jr PS  opened 1967 Sir Oliver Mowat Collegiate Institute (TDSB) is a public secondary school located in Port Union, adjacent to West Rouge. The area is also a short distance from two public post- secondary campuses in the nearby Highland Creek. Centennial College's Morningside Campus is located along Highland Creek's western boundary on Morningside Avenue. The University of Toronto also operates a satellite campus in the neighbourhood, the University of Toronto Scarborough. Both institutions are an approximately 8 minute drive, or 15 minute bus ride away from West Rouge. Recreation Rouge Pond at Rouge National Urban Park. A portion of the national urban park is located in West Rouge. The neighbourhood of West Rouge is home to several municipal parks managed by the Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division, such as West Rouge Park. In addition to municipal parks, the neighbourhood is also home to a portion of the Rouge National Urban Park, the only national urban park in Canada. Rouge National Urban Park is situated along the western boundary of the city, with the mouth of the Rouge River located within the neighbourhood.

He identified the titular see with the former residential see of Dodona and gave information on early Bishops of Dodona.Louis Petit, \\"Bodone\\" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1907) Confusing matters further, there were two cities in Greece named \\"Dodona\\", the one in Epirus, noted above, and another one in Thessaly, which Stephanus of Byzantium writes was also called Bodona (ŒíœâŒ¥œéŒΩŒ∑).

A piano-based songwriter with a romantic style and a warm, distinctly accented voice, he has distinctive long dreadlocks, eyeliner and outfits he describes as \\"hobo chic\\". His live performances have a theatrical style inspired by Vaudeville and music hall, and often incorporate 78s played on an old-fashioned gramophone, or sound effects from a transistor radio. He is most often accompanied by percussionist \\"Temperance Society\\" Chip Bailey, who plays cheese graters and egg whisks, a Stumpf fiddle and a Shruti box, as well as the more typical drums and cymbals. Other musicians who perform with Wilson from time to time include Paul Pilot (guitar), R√©a Curran (trumpet, backing vocals, accordion), Ben Castle (clarinet, saxophone), Ben Hales (bass guitar), Gareth Williams, \\"Professor\\" Ger Eaton (keyboards), Dan Donnelly (mandoline, backing vocals) and Serge Archibald III (saxophone, \\"ethereal background sounds\\", vibes). His albums include Adventures in Gramophone (2005), Songs from the Deep Forest (2006), both of which were nominated for the Choice Music Prize, I Never Thought This Day Would Come (2008), Little Revolutions (2009), The Silent World of Hector Mann (2010), Mother Courage and Her Children (2010), Under the Dark Cloth (2011), Oh Pioneer (2012),, Look Out Machines! (2015) and Hallow (2017). Background Wilson was born in Lisburn and grew up in Coleraine, Downpatrick and Holywood with his mother, father and three sisters. Wilson's grandmother, Mary Groves, taught his mother and her brothers and sisters to play the piano. This tradition of playing the piano was passed on to Wilson's three sisters and eventually to him also. He attended Down High School, Downpatrick and later Sullivan Upper School in Holywood. After leaving school and a brief stint with a community arts project in Swindon, England he returned home and played piano for Brian Houston (a Belfast songwriter influenced by Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, Bruce Springsteen, Johnny Cash and Elvis) under whom Wilson apprenticed, picking up a hunger for performing and a knack of winning over an audience in the process. Several band mutations on the musical journey followed and saw Wilson front other acts composed of Belfast musicians but he was yet to hit his stride. He currently resides in Belfast. Peter Wilson has 3 children called Ben Dornan Wilson, Shay David Wilson and Oscar Peter Wilson. Solo work In 2002, he went solo, adopting the name Duke Special, and began building up a following as a live performer. He released three EPs on Medieval Haircut Records, the first two of which, Lucky Me and My Villain Heart, were collected as an album, Adventures in Gramophone, released by Hag Records in 2005. The album was nominated for the 2006 Choice Music Prize. In 2006, he signed to V2 Records and released a second album, Songs from the Deep Forest. He featured on Later... with Jools Holland alongside Amy Winehouse and John Legend the following November and the album was nominated for the 2007 Choice Music Prize. Duke Special was nominated for three 2007 Meteor Music Awards, for best Irish male, best newcomer, and best album for Songs from the Deep Forest. In 2007, he headlined a concert with the Ulster Orchestra at Belfast's Waterfront Hall, \\"Orchestral Manoevres\\". The concert was supported by Julie Feeney and Foy Vance, who sang on \\"This Could Be My Last Day\\". 2007 also saw him perform at Greenbelt festival, Glastonbury, Guilfest, Summer Sundae, Haldern Festival and the Electric Picnic. Additionally in 2007, he performed as part of the BBC Electric Proms, supporting former Kinks lead singer Ray Davies, and he supported Crowded House during ten tour dates, culminating with a concert at Royal Albert Hall in December. Duke Special's third album, I Never Thought This Day Would Come, was released in Ireland in October 2008 on Universal, who had acquired V2 in 2007. In August 2008, he appeared on the BBC Northern Ireland television show Sesame Tree with his band, having also written the theme music for the show. Later in 2008, he won the Meteor Music Award for Best Irish Male. In 2009, he played on the O2 stage at Oxegen and between September and December 2009 appeared on stage at the Royal National Theatre in London as part of a new production of Bertolt Brecht's play Mother Courage and Her Children, for which he wrote music for a number of songs. The production was directed by Deborah Warner and starred Fiona Shaw in the title role. In January 2010, he launched a campaign on Pledge Music (see Fan-funded music) whereby fans pledged for items to help fund the promotion and touring of his triple CD, The Stage, A Book & The Silver Screen (comprising Mother Courage and Her Children, The Silent World of Hector Mann and Huckleberry Finn). On 11 September 2010, Duke Special played at the Last Night of the Proms for the BBC at Hillsborough Castle. In January 2011, he presented a documentary on the life and songs of Belfast's Ruby Murray and released Duke Special Sings the Songs of Ruby Murray. In March 2011, he performed songs based on the photographs of Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen and Paul Strand at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. These songs were subsequently released in November 2011 as the album Under the Dark Cloth performed alongside The RT√â Concert Orchestra, conducted by David Brophy, with leader Joanne Quigley and arranged for orchestra by Michael Keeney.

After high school, Piovani enrolled at the Sapienza University of Rome, receiving his degree in piano from the Verdi Conservatory in Milan in 1967, and later studied orchestration under the Greek composer Manos Hadjidakis. Among his more popular works is the score for the Federico Fellini film Intervista, his second of three collaborations with the famous director, the others being Ginger e Fred (Ginger and Fred in English) and La voce della luna (The Voice of the Moon). Years later, he composed a ballet titled Balletto Fellini. In 2000 his Academy Award-winning score for La Vita √® bella (Life Is Beautiful) was further nominated for a Grammy Award in the \\"Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media\\" category, losing to Randy Newman. In 2005 he was a member of the jury at the 27th Moscow International Film Festival. In light of his recent work with French directors, notably Dani√®le Thompson, Philippe Lioret, and √âric-Emmanuel Schmitt, the French Minister of Culture gave him the title of Chevalier (Knight) of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres on 21 May 2008 at the Cannes Film Festival. To date, Piovani has over 130 film scores to his credit, including films such as Slap the Monster on Page One (1972), The Perfume of the Lady in Black (1974), Flavia the Heretic (1974), Le Orme (1975), A Leap in the Dark (1980) The Night of the Shooting Stars (1982), and Kaos (1984). The music for the latter is considered by many as one of the best film scores ever done. However, he is reported to believe that \\"Too many film scores make a composer a hack, but in the theatre music is above all craftsmanship\\". Accordingly, he continues to work in musical theatre, and also composes concert and chamber music.

She was the leader of the Peasants and New Democratic Party Union and the Lithuanian People's Party. From 1981‚Äì1986, she worked in West Germany. She ran in the 2004 Lithuanian presidential election against Valdas Adamkus, hoping to receive votes from supporters of impeached president Rolandas Paksas. She finished in second place in the first round and was defeated in the runoff. Prunskienƒó is also a member of the Council of Women World Leaders, an International network of current and former women presidents and prime ministers whose mission is to mobilize the highest-level women leaders globally for collective action on issues of critical importance to women and equitable development.  Early life and education  Prunskienƒó was born as Kazimira Danutƒó Stankeviƒçi≈´tƒó in the village of Vasiuli≈°kƒó.

Early life and education Henry Edward Schunck was born in Manchester, the son of Martin Schunck, a German merchant. His grandfather was Major Johann-Carl Schunck (1745‚Äì1800). Edward started studying chemistry in Manchester with William Henry. The young Schunck was sent to further his chemical studies to Berlin where he studied under Heinrich Rose (1795‚Äì1864) who discovered niobium, diligently analysed minerals and other inorganic substances and studied the chemistry of titanium, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, sulphur, selenium and tellurium. Schunck also studied at Berlin under Heinrich Gustav Magnus (1802‚Äì1870) who published over 80 papers on many diverse topics in chemistry and physics. After studying in Berlin he received his PhD under Justus Liebig at the University of Gie√üen. Work It was from Gie√üen that in 1841 he published his first research paper, in Liebig's famous journal Annalen der Chemie. His topic concerned the effect of nitric acid on aloes. Schunck published his results in two papers in 1841 and 1848. The reaction between the aloe and nitric acid gives among other products, aloetic acid which on further reaction is converted into chrysammic acid. Glover (1855) describes the preparation: \\"Chrysammic acid ... is obtained by steeping 1 part of aloes in 8 of nitric acid, sp. gr. 1.37, and heating the mass in a porcelain capsule until the chief part of the action is over, then distilling off in a retort two-thirds of the nitric acid ; three or four parts of nitric acid are afresh introduced into the retort, and the whole kept for two or three days at a temperature near to boiling point. After disengagement of gas has ceased, water is added to the residue, which forms a precipitate ‚Äì the chrysammic acid. The mother liquid contains oxalic and chrysolipic acids, which latter appears to be picric.\\" Schunck analysed samples of chrysammic acid, now known to be 1,8‚Äìdihydroxy‚Äì2,4,5,7‚Äìtetranitroanthraquinone, and several of its metal salts, concluding that the formula of the acid was C15H3N4O12. This is very near to the currently accepted formula of C14H4N4O12 which was obtained by Mulder a few years later. Dye-producing lichen The purple from lichens was an important commercial product and came in a variety of forms, for example, orchil and cudbear. By the 1830s the researches of Pierre Jean Robiquet (1780‚Äì1840), Friedrich Heeren (1803‚Äì1885), Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Robert John Kane (1809‚Äì1890) into the constituents of lichens had revealed three colour precursors: orcinol, erythrin and pseudoerythrin, but their constitution was not precisely known. Liebig encouraged Schunck to reinvestigate the subject using dye-producing lichens that grow on the basalt rocks of the Vogelsberg in Upper Hessia. In 1842, he discovered a new compound which he called lecanorin. His interpretation of the analyses of lecanorin (now called lecanoric acid) went astray because he used an incorrect formula for orcinol and because his lecanoric acid had partially hydrolysed to give orsellinic acid leading to an incorrect result. The true story was unravelled by Stenhouse some years later. Later he discovered, in addition to lecanoric acid, another new compound, parellic acid from Lecanora parella. In Britain; work on madder In 1842, he came back to Britain and started a career in the chemical industry. Madder was an important dye and imports into the UK were valued at ¬£1.25 million per year in the 1860s. Schunck started his extensive investigations into the colouring materials in madder in 1846. The main colorant of madder was discovered by Robiquet and Colin in 1827 and called alizarin. Their analysis gave a formula C37H48O10. When purified by Schunck using sublimation and crystallisation, he obtained a result which suggested C14H8O4, but taking into account the analyses of metal derivatives as well, he chose C14H10O4 as the best result. The modern formula is C14H8O4. He found that oxidation of alizarin with nitric acid gave alizaric acid (phthalic acid) which on heating gave pyroalizaric acid (phthalic anhydride). This led to the suggestion that alizarin was a derivative of naphthalene, a C10 hydrocarbon, although Schunck pointed out that this did not explain the reactions of alizarin. He was vindicated when Graebe and Liebermann (1868) distilled alizarin with zinc dust to give anthracene, a C14 hydrocarbon, and subsequently (1869) synthesised alizarin from anthraquinone. Schunck showed that alizarin was not the major colour precursor component of fresh madder root, but it was a yellow, bitter, water-soluble component, which he called rubian. Rubian was obtained from the water extract of madder root by adding bone‚Äìcharcoal and extracting the bone‚Äìcharcoal with ethanol. Rubian was an uncrystallisable gum, hydrolysable by acids or an enzyme contained in the madder root to give alizarin and a sugar. Rubian was actually a mixture of glycosides of di and trihydroxy anthraquinones of which a major component was ruberythric acid which is an alizarin 2‚Äìb‚Äìprimeveroside. Many other \\"compounds\\" derived from the hydrolysis of rubian were described and enthusiastically named by Schunck: rubiretin, verantin, rubiacin, rubiadin, rubiapin, rubiafin and others, but some of these are most likely to be impure alizarin, and best forgotten. Some of Schunck's original samples were examined in 1975 by Wilfrid Farrar. Rubiadin was shown to be 1,3‚Äìdihydroxy‚Äì2‚Äìmethyl anthraquinone, which Schunck assigned as the 4‚Äìmethyl isomer. Rubiacine was identical to nordamnacanthal (1,3‚Äìdihydroxyanthraquinone‚Äì2‚Äìaldehyde) and rubianine was an unusual C‚Äìglucoside of unknown constitution. Work on indigo In 1855, Schunck turned his attention to the subject of indigo, preferring the name indigo-blue to the alternative name, Indigotine. He grew woad from \\"good French woad seed\\", extracted the dye precursor with cold ethanol and after further processing obtained a brown syrup which he called \\"indican\\". \\"Indican\\" was quite unstable and resisted further purification. Later he also investigated Polygonum tinctorium and believed that it contained the same \\"indican\\". Only in the early years of the 20th century was it shown that Schunck's \\"indican\\" from woad was not the same as the indican from tropical indigo plants and Polygonum tinctorium, and it was renamed isatan, which was even later shown to be a mixture of isatan A, B and C. The presence of indigo in urine has long been the subject of much curiosity and Schunck tried in 1857 to show that \\"indican\\" was the origin. Believing that the occurrence of indigo was more common than generally supposed at the time, he examined the urine of 40 individuals, all apparently healthy, with ages between 7 and 55 years, mostly of the working class. In all but one case the result was positive. The largest amount of indigo was obtained from a man above the age of 50, a publican by trade. In his own case, the amount \\"varied most capriciously from a tolerable quantity to a mere trace\\". He thought this variation might be due to different kinds of diet, but after many experiments, found only one which worked: \\"I took on the next night, before going to bed, a mixture of treacle and arrowroot boiled with water in as large a quantity as the stomach could bear, and the effect was that the urine of the following night gave a large quantity of indigo-blue\\". The indigo precursor in urine turns out not to be indican, although it was called medical indican at the time, but indoxyl sulfate or gluconurate.Schunck, Edward (1857) \\"On the Occurrence of Indigo-blue in Urine\\", Philosophical Magazine, 1857, 14, pp. 288‚Äì296 Personal life His married Judith H.

Obituary Notices of Fellows Deceased Legacy Schunck Building, University of Manchester Schunck built a private laboratory in the grounds of his home, \\"The Oaklands\\", in Kersal, which together with his library and collection of specimens were bequeathed to the Victoria University of Manchester. He also donated ¬£20,333 to the University for chemical research. The laboratory was removed from Kersal in 1904 and re-erected in Burlington Street next to other laboratories of the university. It is no longer used as a laboratory and is Grade II listed; the building is named after him. The room in which Schunck kept his library on the first floor is remarkably ornate. His books are now in the John Rylands University Library and his specimens in the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester. Chaim Weizmann spent a period working in this laboratory during his time at Manchester. References External Links * Edward Schunck The famous Manchester chemist * (reprinted in Farrar.

Work began on Bar 17 shortly after the breakup of Phish, but had to temporarily suspend the project due to the absence of producer Bryce Goggin. During the long hiatus in the middle of the album's production, Anastasio flew to Atlanta to record his 2005 album Shine, which was very pop-oriented and different from Anastasio's normal musical style. Bar 17 contains songs written over roughly three years by Anastasio, from the spring of 2003 to the spring of 2006. The album features contributions by a greatly varied cast of musicians including Phish bandmates Mike Gordon and Jon Fishman as well as the Benevento/Russo Duo and John Medeski. The album credits a total of 42 musicians as performing on various tracks. The first single released from the album is Dragonfly, recorded with Mike Gordon and the Benevento/Russo Duo. Unlike Shine, no video has been recorded. Bar 17 was released on October 3, 2006. Pre-orders made on Anastasio's official webstore came with a bonus disc, 18 Steps.

Densely populated, Hengrabari resembles the character of a small town in the heart of Guwahati. A few decades ago the areas around Hengrabari were covered with dense forest, tall trees and wild bushes. However, with the pressure of increase in population, these forests were burned and cleared, the hillocks were cut down and the plain agricultural land were filled up for building houses and commercial shops. Etymology Hengrabari is Boro origin. Hengra means barrier and Bari means forest or village. Description Hengrabari has now been divided into two parts, lower hengrabari and upper hengrabari. Borbari which borders upper hengrabari are populated by the indigenous tribal people. With the construction of a national highway road passing through upper hengrabari and borbari, the area has been emerging as a commercial hub. Thamakitilla is a small hillock on the southern side of the areas bordering upper hengrabari. This hillock is densely populated and consisted of around seventy residential houses. A vernacular high school and a college is situated to the south of Thamakitilla. To the eastern side of Thamakitilla is a low- lying paddy fields. In the rainy season these low-lying paddy fields remain submerged with rain water, limiting cultivators to grow paddy only on a part of the considerably elevated land. Culture An old mythological story runs that the present elevated land Thamakitilla was the divine place where Gods and goddesses were used to halt during their journey. People believe that there exist a divine boat made of stone on the eastern side of Thamakitilla that touches the low-lying paddy fields. On the north-eastern part of the hillock, there is a temple of Goddess Mata Vaishno Devi. It is believed that this place has been a favourite destination of the supreme divine. A temple also exist on the top of the hillock and people gather there for prayer on various occasions. This temple belongs to the Hindu God, Lord Shiva, the protector of living beings. (inputs from Bharat Prasad, shall provide more..). A very famous Kali temple is also present in the area which also consist of the temple of lord Shiva, the Sani temple and the Ganesh temple. The temple is said to have a great historical significance and was established during the time when the place was ruled by the Rani or the Queen of Beltola. The main structure of the temple was constructed in the late 70's and its development is further going on with the help various donations received from the people. The temple celebrates various festivals like the Shivaratri, Ganesh Puja and the Kali Puja being the most significant. During Kali Puja lots of devotees throng the temple from different parts of the city as well the state to take blessings of Goddess Kali. Apart from these an annual ritual known as \\"Jagya\\" in the local language is also performed for the well being of the people belonging to the locality. There are several Reserved Forests (Indian Forest Act, 1927) in and around Guwahati. The reserved forests within the limits of Guwahati Municipal Corporation, are Hengrabari, Phatasil and Jalukbari. These forests are under the administrative control of the Divisional Forest Officer, Kamrup (East) Forest Division. The other reserved forests around Guwahati are Rani and Garbhanga RFs. Deepar Beel, which is a vast expanse of water body on the western side of the city is not only a Ramsar site, but also is a Wildlife Sanctuary. The forests act as the green lung of Guwahati, but, unfortunately, a large chunk of the area is encroached by unauthorized occupants. The Rani and Garbhanga RFs have a large population of elephants. Sometimes, wild elephants come down and damage the paddy crops around the Deepar Beel area. To control the menace, and streamline wildlife management in and around Guwahati, the Government of Assam constituted Guwahati Wildlife Division in the early parts of 2006.

It was one of the first significant audio applications for personal computers in general. SoundEdit was known for its ease of use. It made audio manipulation accessible to those who were not musicians or audio professionals.  History  SoundEdit was one of three audio applications created during a sabbatical by Steve Capps during 1986. The Macintosh had no built-in sound input, so the MacRecorder audio digitizer was invented for this purpose in 1985 by Michael Lamoureux, a mathematics student at the University of California, Berkeley. The MacRecorder hardware and software was publicly released through the Berkeley Macintosh Users Group as a kit in late 1985. SoundEdit first shipped in January 1988, as part of a hardware product called MacRecorder Sound System, by a company called Farallon Computing (which eventually became Netopia). The default sampling rate in SoundEdit was 22,256 Hz. One of the major drivers for SoundEdit was Apple's HyperCard. With MacRecorder Sound System, stack makers could finally create alternatives to HyperCard's two built-in sounds. The other multimedia programs of the time, (Director and Authorware) also adopted it right away. In 1991, SoundEdit was bought by Macromind-Paracomp, which became Macromedia (now Adobe Systems).  SoundEdit 16  Macromedia rebranded the program as 'SoundEdit 16' and expanded its capabilities to support CD-quality stereo audio (16-bit) and added QuickTime soundtrack editing and an audio plug-in architecture. The new version also supported handling of sound files bigger than available RAM. A free plug-in was included to convert sound files into '.SWA' format, an early form of mp3 file. These SWA files could be streamed to web viewers using by the free web audio player (downloadable from Macromedia) or by creating a custom interactive Shockwave experience embedded into a web page. Shockwave content is created by using the Director multimedia authoring program. The SoundEdit 16 software was discontinued by Macromedia in December 2004. The final version only runs on PowerPC Macs running Classic Mac OS. It does not run under Mac OS X.

William Ingram believes it was probably the first of the three to begin construction, and may have been the first completed. Establishment The Mayor and Corporation of London banned plays in 1572 as a measure against the plague, and in 1575 they formally expelled all players from the city. This prompted the construction of playhouses outside the jurisdiction of London, in the liberties of Halliwell (in Shoreditch) and later the Clink, and at Newington near the established entertainment district of St. George's Fields. The Newington theatre was located not on Newington Butts itself, but nearby on the east side of Walworth Road near the junction with New Kent Road. The playhouse stood less than an acre of land in Lurklane, occupying of frontage on what became Walworth Road and bounded to the south by a drainage ditch (or \\"sewer\\" in the language of the time).Ingram (1992) pp 157‚Äì158 Ingram has a general map on page 151 and a more detailed map on p 161 Ingram uses Commissions of Sewers records of 1576‚Äì1578 to deduce that the actor Jerome Savage lived adjacent to the sewer and thus the playhouse was in the northern part of the plot.Ingram (1992) pp 160‚Äì162 The Reliance Building used to occupy the site; it is now under the southern roundabout of the Elephant and Castle junction. Lurklane was out of leased in 1566 from the Dean and Chapter of Canterbury Cathedral by Richard Hick(e)s. Hicks was a grocer and member of the royal retinue, sometimes described as a \\"yeoman of the guard\\".Ingram (1992) pp 153‚Äì157 discusses Hicks in detail. Hicks sublet Lurklane to Jerome Savage on or about Lady Day (25 March) 1576, some three weeks before the lease was signed for The Theatre in Shoreditch.Ingram (1992) p 164 However, soon after the 1576 lease was signed, Hicks and his son-in-law Peter Hunningborne tried to rescind it. They failed to do so through the courts, but used trickery to make Savage default on his rent on Lady Day 1577.Ingram (1992) p 166 Savage appears to have stayed on the premises, and in turn sought the protection of the law as Hunningborne sought to move into Savage's residence.Ingram (1992) pp 167‚Äì168 Hunningborne described Savage as \\"a verrie lewed fealowe\\" who \\"liveth by noe other trade than playinge of staige plaies and Interlevdes\\".Ingram (1992) p 168 However the sewer assessments indicate that Savage remained on the premises, so the lawsuit may have been withdrawn or settled out of court. Wickham et al interpret these documents to mean that Hicks constructed a 'house or tenement' that someone (presumably the actor Savage) converted into a playhouse. It was clearly established by Lady Day 1577 and like the Theatre may have been in use before the winter of 1576/77,Ingram (1992) p 170 or even in 1575.Wickham et al (2000) p 320 Savage may have built the theatre under the patronage of the Earl of Warwick whose company of actors first performed at court on 14 February 1575. Warwick had been appointed to the Privy Council in the autumn of 1573, and the more powerful privy councillors ‚Äì the earls of Sussex, Lincoln, Arundel and his younger brother Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester ‚Äì were all patrons of playing companies.Ingram (1992) p 172 Success and decline Warwick's company appears to have flourished for around five years, before ill-health forced him to retire to his home in Hertfordshire. On 13 May 1580 the Privy Council wrote to the Surrey justices about an unknown company playing at Newington Butts despite a ban on theatre.Ingram (1992) p 174 It is known that John and Lawrence Dutton led members of Warwick's company to reform as the Earl of Oxford's players by April 1580, and Ingram speculates that it was they who were playing at their old home. Oxford was sent to the Tower of London in 1581, banished from court until 1 June 1583Historical Manuscripts Commission, The Manuscripts of His Grace the Duke of Rutland, i, p. 150 and went off to war in Flanders in 1585. John Dutton left for the newly formed Queen's Men in 1583 but Oxford's Men survived the loss of their leader, being recorded in each year 1584‚Äì1587 and leaving traces of activity thereafter.Ingram (1992) p 175 A sewer record of 26 February 1591 refers to Hunningborne and the playhouse.Ingram (1992) p 176 By that time it seems to have been in decline, as more theatres sprung up closer to London. Some time in the early 1590s (and definitely before September 1593) Lord Strange's Men played three days there, but the undated Privy Council document comments on the inconvenience of its location and \\"of longe tyme plaies haue not there bene vsed on working daies\\". Plague closed down London's theatres for most of the period between 22 June 1592 and 14 May 1594.Wickham et al (2000) p 328 The impresario Philip Henslowe took the opportunity to remodel his Rose Theatre, but for some reason the Privy Council kept it closed from 16 May to 15 June 1594. Accordingly, Henslowe promoted a series of plays at Newington Butts from 3‚Äì13 June 1594 with the Admiral's Men and Lord Chamberlain's Men, the two companies that had emerged from Lord Strange's men during the layoff. The nature of Henslowe's relationship with Newington Butts is uncertain, Vickers among others has suggested Henslowe owned it by this time but Wickham et al speculate that the poor profits he recorded for the season were in part due to the cost of renting the theatre. The ownership theory might be bolstered by Winifred Frazer's suggestion that the enigmatic abbreviation 'ne' used by Henslowe in his records of certain plays, conventionally taken to mean a new play, applies to a performance at Newington. This season of plays in June 1594 is well documented, as Henslowe kept assiduous records in his \\"Diary\\".The June 1594 season was as follows : 3rd Hester and Ahasuerus, 4th The Jew of Malta, 5th Andronicus, 6th Cutlack (since lost), 7th (no show), 8th Bellendon (since lost), 9th Hamlet, 10th Hester, 11th The Taming of a Shrew, 12th Andronicus, 13th The Jew These include some of the earliest known performances of familiar names such as Hamlet, Titus Andronicus and The Taming of a Shrew but in each case the exact relationship between the 1594 plays and those we know as Shakespeare's is uncertain and controversial among scholars. Rutter regards the Titus put on by Henslowe at the Rose in January 1594 as \\"almost certainly Shakespeare's\\", but it is very early for the Hamlet of the Second Quarto and First Folio, which is ascribed to around 1600. This and other evidence has led to the theory that the 1600 text is based on an earlier play, the so-called \\"Ur-Hamlet\\", which was written by either Thomas Kyd, Shakespeare, or someone else. This performance is the first one on record of Ur-Hamlet, although it appears to have existed since at least 1589. On 6 July 1594 the Dean and Chapter let the playhouse site to Paul Buck, on condition that he convert the playhouse to other uses and that no more plays were performed after Michaelmas (29 September). Buck seems to have complied ‚Äì there is no mention of the playhouse in the renewal of his lease on 5 April 1595, and on 5 October 1599 the Sewer Commission refers to \\"the houses where the old playe house did stand att Newington\\". The theatrical links lingered after the theatre was gone; a bad pun is referred to as a \\"Newington conceit\\" in a play of 1612Chambers (1923) vol 2 p 405, referring to Field's A Woman is a Weathercock III. iii. 25 and the playwright Thomas Middleton died there and was buried at Newington Butts church on 4 July 1627.

He is the author of over 500 published articles and 9 books in fields such as personal growth, natural history, deep ecology, spirituality and nature, alternative healing, poetry, wildcrafting, American history and the legends of the Wild West. He lives and teaches at the Anim√° Sanctuary, located in the mountainous wild-lands of Southwest New Mexico.  Writing career  Hardin is the author of 9 books and over 500 published magazine articles. He began his writing career as a young runaway from military school in the 1960s, publishing short pieces and poems in alternative periodicals including Win, The Guardian and Communities. For the first 30 years wrote in wild nature and personal growth, responsibility and activism in self-help, alternative spirituality and ecology oriented publications such as Mother Earth News, The Trumpeter, Green Egg, Sowell Review, Sentient Times, Creations, New Thought Journal, Hight Country News, Magical Blend and Natural Beauty & Health. His coining of the word \\"Rewilding\\" ‚Äì and writings on personal as well as ecological rewilding ‚Äì are considered seminal to the budding Neoprimitivist and Wildcrafting communities. The word ReWilding was first coined by Anim√° teacher and author Jesse Wolf Hardin under the pen name Lone Wolf Circles in 1986, and was meant to refer to personal rewilding (primal awareness, meeting one's needs, acting not out of obedience but personal responsibility) as well as wilderness restoration. It first saw print in his article by that name in July 1988, in the premier issue of a zine published by an insurgent group of disgruntled Earth First! activists, and again in 1996 in the May/June and July/August issues of Oberon Zell- Ravenheart's nationally distributed Green Egg Magazine. Both of Hardin's published references appear to predate use of the word \\"Rewilding\\" by both conservationists (such as Dave Foreman and his Rewilding Institute) and anarchist groups. (See also ReWilding entry in The Encyclopedia of Religion of Nature, published by Thoemmes Continuum in 2005.) As his understandings evolved, he began expanding his efforts to reach a wider audience, from literary works for the more conservative readers of Gray's Sporting Journal, to academic and practitioner entries for the definitive Encyclopedia of Nature & Religion. Hardin's work forms a body of nature-informed insights and lessons that can be utilized by people of any religious or philosophical persuasion to deepen, enliven, enrich and empower their lives. His work has been praised by a number of writers and thinkers from Edward Abbey to Terry Tempest Williams,\\"Jesse inspires our passion to take us further seeing the world whole, even holy.\\" -Terry Tempest Williams, author of Refuge: An Unnatural History of Family and Place Anima Center: Your Guides Roderick Nash, Jerry Mander, Joanna Macy, Oberon Zell-Ravenheart, Gary Snyder\\"A surprising experience-archaic, fresh, futuristic, wild, refined, all at once. Which should be no surprise-that's how the real world is. My respects to Wolf Hardin.\\" -Gary Snyder, Pulitzer Prize winning author (on the back cover of Gaia Eros) and Ralph Metzner.\\"Wolf's word and voice is the ecstatic song of a man intoxicated with the beauty and diversity of life. The high-spirited and soulful voices of the animals, and of the Earth herself, speak and sing through him, reminding us of our ancient heritage of sacred wildness.\\" -Ralph Metzner, author of Green Psychology Edward Abbey, a friend and supporter of Hardin's until his death, mentions him in his novel Hayduke Lives!. Terry Tempest Williams writes that in 2000, Hardin founded the Anim√° teachings (www.animacenter.org), a self-described \\"empowering set of nature based insights and practices\\" detailed in his self-published books The Way of Anima and Home: Reinhabiting Self, Recovering Sense Of Place. Most recently he has authored detailed lesson materials for the Anim√° Shaman Path and Medicine Woman Correspondence Courses, and an illustrated children's book I'm A Medicine Woman, Too!.  Lecturer  Hardin teaches Anim√° Correspondence Courses online, as well as presenting workshops on Earth Path Shamanism. He resides at and co-directs the Anim√° Center, a wildlife sanctuary and wilderness restoration project in New Mexico‚Äôs Gila National Forest, where he and his partners Kiva Rose and Loba host workshops, vision quests, Medicine Woman Tradition student internships and wilderness retreats.

It was owned by investment and advisory catalyst LundXY. History and profile Nyhedsavisen was first published on 6 October 2006. In its first year the paper had a circulation of 160,000 copies. In March 2007 its circulation was 400,000 copies. At its inception, the paper was owned by the Icelandic Baugur Group, with minority stakes held by a number of co-founders, including Morten Lund. However, in January 2008, Baugur decided to sell Lund a 51% majority share of Dagsbrun Media, the holding company for the newspaper. For the acquisition, Lund had teamed up with Morten Wagner of Freeway, an owner of popular social networking sites such as dating.dk and arto.dk. It is believed that they bought the stake for a single Danish crown. At that stage, the newspaper had lost close to $50 million. Rumour has it that Morten Lund assumed this debt. Detractors pointed out that Nyhedsavisen suffered with funding issues from the outset; at launch, analysts were concerned that Baugur's ¬£45m investment was too small to keep it afloat. It was also reported in the Danish press that the newspaper lost 200m Danish crowns over the course of 2007, before Lund's takeover. However, under new ownership it officially claimed the position of most widely read newspaper in Denmark, with a daily circulation of 551,000 copiesFreewat aps and A-Pressen have taken over the news paper's on-line edition. The paper was closed in August 2008 with a reported deficit of approximately $100 million, generated mostly under the previous ownership, making it the latest victim of the so-called \\"newspaper wars\\" in Denmark. Editorial The editorial management presented Nyhedsavisen as a new journalistic concept because of its special mix of news stories. The mix was meant to make the news paper a contrast to the established newspapers. According to the editorial management at Nyhedsavisen the old news papers were too reactionary, because they published too many stories based on the political system. Nyhedsavisen categorized these stories as the World of power. The idea was to downgrade these type of stories. Instead the news paper should contain much more stores from what 'Nyhedsavisen named The unknown World and Our world. These two categories respectively contained stories about for instance new science and family life. The competing newspapers that Nyhedsavisen criticized has denied that Nyhedsavisen contributed with a new type of newspaper.

Biography The son of the radical Protestant theologian Gustav Wislicenus, Johannes was born on 24 June 1835 in Kleineichstedt (now part of Querfurt, Saxony-Anhalt) in Prussian Saxony, and entered Halle University in 1853. In October 1853 he emigrated to the United States with his family. For a brief time he acted as assistant to Harvard chemist Eben Horsford, and in 1855 was appointed lecturer at the Mechanics' Institute in New York. Returning to Europe in 1856, he continued to study chemistry with Wilhelm Heinrich Heintz at the University of Halle. In 1860, he began lecturing at the University of Z√ºrich, and at the Swiss Polytechnical Institute and by 1868 he was Professor of Chemistry at the university. In 1870, he was chosen to succeed Georg Staedeler as Professor of General Chemistry at the Swiss Polytechnical Institute in Z√ºrich, retaining also the position of full professor at the University of Z√ºrich. In 1872, he succeeded Adolph Strecker in the chair of chemistry at University of W√ºrzburg, and in 1885, he succeeded Hermann Kolbe as Professor of Chemistry at the University of Leipzig, where he died on 6 December 1902. Research By the late 1860s, Wislicenus devoted his research to organic chemistry. His work on the isomeric lactic acids from 1868 to 1872 resulted in the discovery of two substances with different physical properties but with an identical chemical structure. He called this difference \\"geometrical isomerism\\". He would later promote J. H. van't Hoff's theory of the tetrahedral carbon atom, believing that it, together with the supposition that there are \\"specially directed forces, the affinity-energies\\", which determine the relative position of atoms in the molecule, afforded a method by which the spatial arrangement of atoms in particular cases may be ascertained by experiment. While at W√ºrzburg, Wislicenus developed the use of ethyl aceto acetate in organic synthesis. However, he was also active in inorganic chemistry, finding a reaction for the production of sodium azide. He was the first to prepare cyclopentane in 1893J. Wislicenus and W. Hentschel (1893) \\"Der Pentamethenylalkohol und seine Derivate\\" (Cyclopentanol and its derivatives), Annalen der Chemie, 275 : 322-330; see especially pages 327-330. Wislicenus prepared cyclopentane from cyclopentanone (\\"Ketopentamethen\\"), which is prepared by heating calcium adipate. Awards In 1898 Wislicenus was awarded the Davy Medal by the Royal Society of London.

The M series was produced only in one cubic capacity ‚Äì 1994 cc (2.0 L), and was a 16 valve development of the older British Leyland O-series unit first seen in 1978. For the Rover 800, there were two different versions, with single point fuel injection (for the Rover 820e) or multi-point injection (for the 820i). The M series uses the same cylinder block as the O-series unit as found in the Maestro and Montego, which mates with the Powertrain Ltd PG-1 manual gearbox. These were also used in the Morgan Plus Four, the only rear wheel drive application this engine was used in, meaning these can be put in rear wheel drive layouts using the Rover LT77 transmission In 1990, the M series was also installed in the Rover 200 series, before being superseded in 1992 by the similar T series which was a development of the same design. Turbocharged version Tickford also tuned the M-series engine which was installed in 536 models of the Rover 820 in 1991. This was nicknamed the Tickford Turbo. It needed to have its power capped: it is believed that marketing had a say in the final power output of the M16 Turbo: The request from marketing was to not hinder V6 sales therefore the performance should be similar to the 2.7-litre Honda V6 (177PS) hence the performance was limited to 180 PS deliberately. In the end, 563 examples were built, of which, many ended up in the hands of BAe executives (BAe/Rover company cars being the biggest source of UK Rover 800 registrations at the time).

Following graduation in 1847, he was commissioned Second Lieutenant in the 4th U.S. Artillery. He would subsequently serve in the United States Army in various capacities over a period of forty years. Willcox served in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, fought against the Indians on the frontier, and again in the Third Seminole War. Following the latter conflict, he resigned from the Army in 1857.

Known as \\"Honest Bill from Olive Hill\\", he represented Kentucky's Ninth District in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1911 to 1923, resigning to become the state's 41st governor. Discouraged by an early defeat for a seat in the state legislature, Fields took a job at a grocery store in Ashland, Kentucky that allowed him to travel the state and meet many people in his congressional district. In 1911, he became the first Democrat elected to Congress from the Ninth District in two decades. Elected to seven consecutive terms, he rose to become the ranking member of the House Committee on Military Affairs during World War I. When Democratic gubernatorial nominee J. Campbell Cantrill died unexpectedly two months before the general election, the Democratic Central Committee chose Fields to replace Cantrill as the nominee. In a campaign that featured more name-calling than substantial debate, Fields secured the backing of the powerful Jockey Club political alliance and won a landslide victory over Republican Attorney General Charles I. Dawson. The first legislative session of Fields' term was marked by infighting within his own party. His agenda was opposed by a Democratic faction led by former governor J. C. W. Beckham, Louisville Courier-Journal publisher Robert Worth Bingham, and political boss Percy Haly. Fields' signature issue, a $75 million bond issue to construct a state highway system, passed the legislature in 1924, but the electorate refused to approve it in November of that year. Among Fields' accomplishments as governor were an increase in the gasoline tax to help fund his highway program, a reorganization of the state's government bureaucracy, and the preservation of Cumberland Falls from industrial development. He never united the factions of his party, however. His political enemies charged him with nepotism and abusing his pardon power, and the Democrats lost the governorship in 1927 to Republican Flem D. Sampson. Following his service as governor, Fields failed in an attempt to return to his former congressional seat. He was appointed to the State Workman's Compensation Board by Governor A. B. \\"Happy\\" Chandler, and after his retirement from public service, he practiced law and worked as a real estate agent until his death on October 21, 1954. Early life William J. Fields was born December 29, 1874 in Willard, Carter County, Kentucky.\\"Fields, William Jason\\". Biographical Directory of the United States Congress He was the fourth of twelve children born to Christopher C. and Alice (Rucker) Fields.Kleber, p. 316Powell, p. 88 He was educated in the local public schools, then matriculated to the University of Kentucky. After graduation, he started a real estate business in Olive Hill, Kentucky and engaged in farming. He also studied law on his own.\\"Kentucky Governor William Jason Fields\\". National Governors Association On October 10, 1893, Fields married Dora McDaniel; the couple had six children. At age 21, he was elected constable of Carter County, but three years later, he fell short in his bid to capture a seat in state legislature. Following the loss, he took a job at a grocery store in Ashland, Kentucky that would allow him to travel the state more freely, make acquaintances, and better position himself for a run for higher office. House of Representatives Campaigning under the moniker \\"Honest Bill from Olive Hill\\", Fields won a narrow victory as a Democrat to represent Kentucky's Ninth District in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1910. The first Democrat to hold the seat in twenty years, he was re-elected for another six consecutive terms.Ellis, p. 156 A member of the Committee on Military Affairs, he eventually became the ranking Democrat on the committee and the ranking member of the subcommittee that controlled appropriations for U.S. operations during World War I. In September 1923, Democratic gubernatorial nominee J. Campbell Cantrill died, leaving the party without a candidate. Alben Barkley, who Cantrill had defeated for the nomination, refused to be the Democratic candidate, perhaps because he had already decided to run for the U.S. Senate in 1926. The Democratic Central Committee chose Fields as a replacement for Cantrill. Governor of Kentucky The general election campaign generated little interest and quickly degenerated into name calling.Klotter, p. 275 Fields' opponent, Republican Attorney General Charles I. Dawson, mocked Fields' traditional election slogan, calling him \\"Dodging Bill from Olive Hill, who answers no questions and never will\\".Harrison, p. 353 Fields countered by referring to Dawson as \\"Changing Charlie\\", a reference to Dawson's one-time affiliation with the Democratic Party prior to becoming a Republican. Fields secured the backing of a group of powerful political bosses, including Louisville banker James B. Brown, U.S. Senator Augustus Owsley Stanley, and Lexington power broker Billy Klair.Ellis, p. 157 These three were the leaders of the Jockey Club, a group dedicated to the preservation of parimutuel betting in the state, especially at racetracks. Discontent with incumbent Republican Governor Edwin P. Morrow further aided Fields' campaign, and he defeated Dawson by a vote of 356,035 to 306,277. It was one of the largest Democratic gubernatorial landslides in state history. He resigned from the House to accept the governorship. Already lightly regarded because he was selected by the Democratic Central Committee instead of a party primary, Fields further weakened his position due to some of his personal preferences. A devout Methodist and prohibitionist, Fields prohibited both dancing and drinking at the Executive Mansion. He moved the inaugural ball from the mansion to the capitol rotunda, where dancing would be allowed, but he and his wife did not attend.Klotter, p. 276 Fields' frugality also led him to keep dairy cows on the mansion's lawn, drawing derision from urban citizens. alt=Black and white image of a clean shaven man with drooping eyelids, aged about forty. He is wearing a black bowler hat, white shirt, tie and dark overcoat. Fields' 1924 address to the General Assembly included several ambitious proposals, including the founding of a trade school for blacks at Paducah, planning and developing normal schools at Murray and Morehead, raising the gasoline tax to three cents per gallon, and the issuance of $75 million in state bonds to finance a state highway system. A dissenting faction of the Democratic party, led by former governor J. C. W. Beckham, political boss Percy Haly, and Louisville Courier-Journal publisher Robert Worth Bingham, voiced strong opposition to Fields' proposals, especially the bond issue. They charged that Fields had the support of a dangerous \\"bipartisan combine\\", with the Republican element of the combine led by Maurice Galvin. Tensions between the factions were inflamed almost as soon as the 1924 legislature convened. A bill to outlaw parimutuel betting in the state passed the House of Representatives, but failed in the Senate. The next legislative battle centered on removing the head of the Board of Charities and Corrections and give the governor greater control over the board's makeup; this attempt also narrowly failed.Harrison, p. 354 When Senator Stanley, an opponent of prohibition, sought re-election to the Senate in 1924, Fields and his allies did not support him, leading to the election of Republican Frederick M. Sackett and giving the Republicans both of the state's senate seats for the first time in history.Klotter, p. 282 The signature issue of the session, however, was Fields' request for the bond issue. He engaged in a debate with opponents of the issue that was published in Bingham's Courier- Journal as well as the Louisville Herald and Louisville Post, two papers owned by James B. Brown. Ultimately, the issue was approved by the General Assembly, which was considered a major victory for Fields. Still, the bond issue had to be approved by the state's electorate.Ellis, p. 158 The Courier-Journal continued the fight against the issue, while Desha Breckinridge's Lexington Herald came out in favor of it. Fields spent ten weeks criss-crossing the state speaking in favor of the bond issue, but on election day, it was rejected by a margin of 90,000 votes. Undaunted by the failure of the bond issue, Fields returned to the 1926 General Assembly with more proposals, including another increase in the gasoline tax to provide the funds needed to construct the state highway system. The 1926 Assembly passed more legislation than any previous legislature, including the increased gas tax and several bills to reorganize state government. The state purchasing commission and the Department of Bus Transportation were among the entities created in the reorganization. Under Fields, the state implemented the first phase of desegregation busing. Fields opposed a plan to develop hydroelectric power generation capabilities on the Cumberland Falls. In order to prevent development, he accepted an offer from T. Coleman du Pont to purchase the property around the falls and donate it to the state. He also suggested the creation of Carter Caves State Resort Park in his home county. Fields' political enemies charged him with corruption and chastised him for issuing too many pardons. He also drew criticism for appointing his eldest son as state examiner, political supporter James Brown as tax commissioner, and other relatives and political supporters to low-ranking positions in the state government. Although the party strongly supported Alben Barkley's senatorial bid in 1926, Fields and his allies refused to support 1927 gubernatorial candidate J. C. W. Beckham, and the governorship went to Republican Flem D. Sampson. Later life and death Following his service as governor, Fields returned to Olive Hill and was admitted to the bar in 1927. Sensing an opportunity for a political comeback in 1930, Fields launched a bid to regain his former seat in the U.S. House, which was now occupied by Republican Elva R. Kendall. Kendall had beaten Fields's successor, Fred M. Vinson in the 1928 Hoover landslide, which saw nine out of eleven (all but the two ancestrally Democratic western Kentucky) U.S. House seats go to the Republicans. Fred Vinson, Fields' one-time ally and successor in Congress and eventual opponent in 1930 and 1934. He would later become U.S. Treasury Secretary and Chief Justice of the United States. Vinson instead chose not to stand aside for his former ally and decisively beat Fields in the August Democratic primary by a margin of 63% to 21% (with a third candidate, W.C. Hamilton taking the remaining 16%).\\"Fields, William J.\\". OurCampaigns Vinson successfully reclaimed his seat in the general election from Kendall. In 1932, Fields was elected Commonwealth's Attorney for Kentucky's thirty-seventh judicial district; he served until 1935. In 1934, Fields again challenged Congressman Vinson in the Democratic primary in the renumbered 8th district, but he lost again by a decisive margin of 68% to 32%. In 1936, Governor A. B. \\"Happy\\" Chandler appointed him to the State Workmen's Compensation Board. He served in this capacity until the election of Republican Simeon S. Willis. Fields retired from public service on August 8, 1944. From 1940 to 1945, he co-owned an insurance agency. He briefly moved to Florida before returning to Olive Hill, where he continued practicing law, and farming. He died in Grayson, Kentucky on October 21, 1954 and was buried in Olive Hill Cemetery in Olive Hill.

As one of the last live-action rail shooters released by the company, which began the series with Mad Dog McCree, it is also arguably the shortest. The game was filmed entirely in at the Old Tucson Studios near Tucson, Arizona, with sets used for several notable films belonging to the Western genre. Global VR re-released the arcade game in 2002. It was also re- released for PC only by Digital Leisure in 2004 (see 2004 in video gaming), with mouse and light gun support. This game was also re-released for WiiWare in North America on January 4, 2010 and in the PAL region on January 22, 2010. A HD port of this game was released for the PlayStation Network on the PlayStation 3 on July 19, 2011 and supported the PlayStation Move controller. A 3DO Interactive Multiplayer version was announced but never released. Plot The player, as is the standard in American Laser Games releases, assumes the role of an anonymous individual who takes part in a series of showdowns with several different gunfighters. It is suggested that the protagonist is a lawman. This is confirmed by the three available difficulty levels: deputy, sheriff and marshal. The Old West setting is the scene of up to five showdowns, during which the player must draw his revolver as quickly as possible and shoot the enemies before they manage to shoot the player. The aim of the game is to defeat all the foes the player is up against; if this is achieved flawlessly, the lawman takes part in a final showdown in which he faces Wes Flowers, \\"one of the world's fastest quick-drawers\\", who is not a fictional character, but a real-life Fast Draw champion. If Flowers is also defeated, the player receives the title of Best Deputy, Super Sheriff or Master Marshal, depending on the difficulty level. Gameplay In each of the gunfights, the player must attempt to out-draw the villains, first by holstering the available light gun and proceeding to wait until a signal is given that lets him know he must draw, aim and fire at the enemy or enemies, as quickly as possible. A foul occurs if one draws the gun too soon, with a maximum of three allowed, and a chance to face Wes Flowers is only given if all four of the previous gunfights are victorious for the player. At times, the player faces two opponents instead of one, but, invariably, only one will draw his or her gun and thus pose a threat. The game ends successfully when the player has defeated all of the villains, including Wes Flowers.

Magnus, first Bishop of Vestervig, was drowned in the Elbe in about 1060, while returning home after his consecration by Adalbert I, Archbishop of Hamburg. Albrik, Dean of Bremen, was the second bishop (1066‚Äì85). It was originally a suffragan of the archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen until 1104, when the Diocese of Lund was elevated to an archdiocese and became B√∏rglum's metropolitan see. Vestervig was the residence of Saint Th√∏ger, a missionary from Thuringia in eastern Germany, and chaplain to the Norwegian king Saint Olaf. After Olaf's death in 1030 Th√∏ger withdrew to Vestervig, where he built a little church of thatch and wattle, and preached Christianity to the local people. He died on 24 June 1067, and was canonised in spite of the opposition of King Svend Estridsen and Bishop Albrik. Eventually Saint Th√∏ger became the patron saint of the diocese. Albrik's successor, Bishop Henry, was chaplain to King Canute IV, later Saint Canute, and accompanied him during his stay in Vendsyssel in June 1086. Bishop Sylvester (1134‚Äì36) transferred the see to the royal estate at B√∏rglum. At about the same time a monastic foundation was settled here, the later B√∏rglum Abbey, although there is little information about its exact nature.It may have been connected with the house of Augustinian Canons at Vestervig In about 1180 the Premonstratensian canons of Steinfeld Abbey in Germany settled here. In about 1220 the Bishop of B√∏rglum made the abbey his seat; the abbey church became the cathedral of the diocese, and its canons formed the diocesan chapter with power to elect the bishop. The last two bishops were Niels Stygge (Rosenkrantz) and his nephew, Stygge Krumpen. Niels Stygge (b. 1455) was Bishop of B√∏rglum from 1486-1533. Stygge Krumpen became coadjutor bishop in 1519, and diocesan bishop in 1533. He made some efforts to stay the progress of Protestantism, but was imprisoned from 1536, when the Reformation was formally introduced into Denmark, to 1542. He was then endowed with the property of the nunnery of Asmild near Viborg, though obliged to maintain the nuns, and died there in 1551. In the territory of the former diocese of B√∏rglum there are notable churches at Vestervig and B√∏rglum, the former dating from the beginning of the twelfth century, and both of them previously cathedrals. Besides B√∏rglum Abbey the diocese contained the following Benedictine nunneries: Frejlev Abbey (1268‚Äì1554), Hundslund Abbey (1268‚Äì1536) and √ò Abbey (1160‚Äì1542). There were also Vestervig Abbey (Augustinian canons), which lasted from 1110 to 1526; the Commandery of the Knights of St. John at Dueholm (1351‚Äì1539); and the Carmelite priory at Saeby (Mariested), which lasted from about 1460 to 1536.

Death of Llywelyn After the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, his brother Dafydd ap Gruffydd carried on resistance for a few months, but was never able to control any large area. He was captured and executed by hanging, drawing and quartering at Shrewsbury in 1283. King Edward I of England now had complete control of Wales. The Statute of Rhuddlan was issued from Rhuddlan Castle in north Wales in 1284. The Statute divided parts of Wales into the counties of Anglesey, Merioneth and Caernarvon, created out of the remnants of Llewelyn's Gwynedd. It introduced the English common law system, and abolished Welsh law for criminal cases, though it remained in use for civil cases. It allowed the King to appoint royal officials such as sheriffs, coroners, and bailiffs to collect taxes and administer justice. In addition, the offices of justice and chamberlain were created to assist the sheriff. The Marcher Lords retained most of their independence, as they had prior to the conquest. Most of the Marcher Lords were by now Cambro Norman i.e. Norman Welsh through intermarriage. King Edward I and rebellions Harlech Castle was one of a series built by Edward I to consolidate his conquest. King Edward I built a ring of impressive stone castles to consolidate his domination of Wales, and crowned his conquest by giving the title Prince of Wales to his son and heir in 1301.Davies, R.R. Conquest, coexistence and change p. 386 Wales became, effectively, part of England, even though its people spoke a different language and had a different culture. English kings paid lip service to their responsibilities by appointing a Council of Wales, sometimes presided over by the heir to the throne. This Council normally sat in Ludlow, now in England but at that time still part of the disputed border area of the Welsh Marches. Welsh literature, particularly poetry, continued to flourish however, with the lesser nobility now taking over from the princes as the patrons of the poets and bards. Dafydd ap Gwilym who flourished in the middle of the fourteenth century is considered by many to be the greatest of the Welsh poets. There were a number of rebellions including ones led by Madog ap Llywelyn in 1294-5 Moore, D. The Welsh wars of independence p.159 and by Llywelyn Bren, Lord of Senghenydd, in 1316-18. In the 1370s the last representative in the male line of the ruling house of Gwynedd, Owain Lawgoch, twice planned an invasion of Wales with French support. The English government responded to the threat by sending an agent to assassinate Owain in Poitou in 1378.Moore, D. The Welsh wars of independence p.164-6 The Black Death The Black Death rapidly spread along the major European sea and land trade routes. The Black Death arrived in Wales in late 1348. What records survive indicate that about 30% of the population died, in line with the average mortality through most of Europe. Glynd≈µr's rebellion In 1400, a Welsh nobleman, Owain Glynd≈µr, revolted against King Henry IV of England. Owain inflicted a number of defeats on the English forces and for a few years controlled most of Wales. Some of his achievements included holding the first Welsh Parliament at Machynlleth and plans for two universities. Eventually the king's forces were able to regain control of Wales and the rebellion died out, but Owain himself was never captured, betrayed nor tempted by Royal pardons. His rebellion caused a great upsurge in Welsh identity and he was widely supported by Welsh people throughout the country.Moore, D. The Welsh wars of independence p.169-85 As a response to Glynd≈µr's rebellion, the English parliament passed the Penal Laws in 1402. These prohibited the Welsh from carrying arms, from holding office and from dwelling in fortified towns. These prohibitions also applied to Englishmen who married Welsh women. These laws remained in force after the rebellion, although in practice they were gradually relaxed.Davies, J. A History of Wales p.199 Wars of the Roses Henry Tudor, later King Henry VII In the Wars of the Roses over the English throne, which began in 1455, both sides made considerable use of Welsh troops. The main figures in Wales were the two Earls of Pembroke, the Yorkist Earl William Herbert and the Lancastrian Jasper Tudor. In 1485 Jasper's nephew, Henry Tudor, landed in Wales with a small force to launch his bid for the throne of England. Henry was of Welsh descent, counting princes such as Rhys ap Gruffydd (The Lord Rhys) among his ancestors, and his cause gained much support in Wales. Henry defeated King Richard III of England at the Battle of Bosworth with an army containing many Welsh soldiers and gained the throne as King Henry VII of England.Williams, G. Recovery, reorientation and reformation pp. 217-26 Annexation to England Under Henry VII's son, Henry VIII of England, the Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542 were passed, annexing Wales to England in legal terms, abolishing the Welsh legal system, and banning the Welsh language from any official role or status, but it did for the first time define the Wales-England border and allowed members representing constituencies in Wales to be elected to the English Parliament.Williams, G. Recovery, reorientation and reformation pp. 268-73 They also abolished any legal distinction between the Welsh and the English, thereby effectively ending the Penal Code although this was not formally repealed.Davies, J.

He plays in the centre-forward position on the Wexford senior hurling team. Early life Michael Jacob was born in Oulart, County Wexford in 1980. He was born into a family that had a strong association with Gaelic games, as his father, Mick Jacob, won both Leinster and All-Ireland medals in hurling with Wexford. Jacob was educated locally and later attended Enniscorthy CBS. It was here that his skill at the game of hurling was developed and he won an All-Ireland \\"B\\" Colleges' medal with the school. Jacob later studied at the Waterford Institute of Technology, where he won two Fitzgibbon Cup medals. Playing career Club Jacob, along with his brother Rory, plays his club hurling with the famous Oulart the Ballagh club in Wexford. He enjoyed some success at underage level before winning back-to-back senior county titles in 2004 and 2005. The club was beaten in their attempt to capture three-in-a-row in 2006. Inter-county Jacob joined the Wexford minor hurling panel in the late 1990s and he quickly moved up the ranks. He subsequently won a Leinster under-21 title in 2001 before making his senior debut that same year. Since then he has enjoyed some success at senior level and is perhaps best known for scoring a famous goal in Croke Park in 2004 as part of the Leinster Senior Hurling Championship. After blocking an attempted clearance from Peter Barry of Kilkenny, Jacob caught the ball and buried it into the net to give Wexford the win in the Leinster hurling semi-final. He subsequently collected his first Leinster medal. Jacob has also represented Leinster in the Interprovincial Championship. In late 2012 he announced his retirement from Inter-county hurling.

The Word list of the Dutch language (, ) is a list of words in the normative spelling of the Dutch language (Dutch orthography). It is officially established by the Dutch Language Union (), and is published in dictionary style. Because of the colour of its published form, it is better known as the Green Booklet (). It differs from a dictionary in that it does not give the meanings of the words, but rather their codified spelling.  Editions  The Green Booklet is published by Sdu in the Netherlands and Lannoo in Flanders. It is available in a paper edition and on CD-ROM at a fee; the Dutch Language Union offers a free official internet version of the list.woordenlijst.org The latest edition was released on 13 October 2015.  History  The first publication was in 1954. A revised word list was not released until 1990. The most recent publication was in 2015. Its content does not differ from the previous version published in 2005. The current spelling has been effective since August 1, 2006. In 1994 the committee of Ministers of the Dutch Language Union decided that the wordlist of the Green Booklet will be updated every ten years. The 2005 edition was the first time that Surinamese Dutch words have been included, about 500 of them were added as was agreed upon when Suriname joined the Language Union in January 2005. The Green Booklet should not be confused with the Green dictionary, which is also a publication of Sdu.  Criticism  The Green Booklet has been criticised in recent years because of its complicated rules such as the rules on how to use an -n between certain compound words. Opponents claim that the rules are too fuzzy and are changing too fast, causing problems in education. Teachers and pupils complain about the lack of simple rules and the many exceptions. In December 2005 a number of major Dutch newspapers, magazines and the broadcaster NOS announced that they will boycott the latest edition of the Green Booklet. It is said to be too confusing, illogical and unworkable to be usable. Instead they will follow the spelling which is laid out in the White Booklet (Witte Boekje). In Flanders, media use the official Green Booklet- spelling.  The Yellow Book  Although the \\"Green Booklet\\" is also the official list of words for Flemish people, they use words which are not in the Green Booklet and not known by people in The Netherlands. However, those words are so commonly used in Flanders, most people are not aware these are not official. Many of those words are even used in newspapers, magazines, and television. On 31 January 2015 De Standaard and some language professionals published the Yellow Book. In this book a word is printed in black or in grey. A black word is a non-official word, but De Standaard will allow it in their newspapers. A grey word is a non-official word which may not be used. It is the intention that other Flemish media will use the Yellow Book.

It is similar in appearance to the Israeli MAPATS (man portable anti-tank system), causing speculation about the link between the two missiles.

In 2005, Norinco revealed in various public events that another version of HJ-9, the HJ-9A was already in service with Chinese armed forces, and this version used semi- active millimetre wave radar guidance. However, only photos of HJ-9A in service with Chinese paratroops were shown to the public. In these photos, the HJ-9A launcher is mounted on a jeep, and Norinco claimed the launcher on vehicles could be rapidly dismounted for foot soldiers.

Moon was a trailblazer and influential figure instrumental in transforming library professionalism, polity, and social responsibility.  Biography  Early life Eric Moon was born on 6 March 1923 in Yeovil, England, and spent most of his youth in Southampton. After receiving his grammar (secondary) school certificate from then Taunton School, Moon was hired as a junior library assistant at the prestigious Southampton Public Library in 1939. The ambitious Moon pursued professional qualification by passing the Library Association's mastery examination. The Library Association is the United Kingdom's foremost library organization, and counterpart to the American Library Association (ALA). Moon soon began his military service in 1941, joining the Royal Air Force. Following his discharge in 1946 he pursued his professional education as a librarian, at the then Loughborough College. While at Loughborough, Moon completed the rigorous requirements of advancement to the highest level of honor, FLA, Fellow of the Library Association. He began his professional career running small libraries in Hertfordshire, at Finchley, at Brentford and Chiswick, and then at Kensington, experimenting with novel ideas in library service through this period. Frustrated with the conservatism of British librarianship, in 1958 he took a job as head of public libraries in Newfoundland, Canada, where he worked for one year. Library Journal In 1959 Moon was hired as editor-in-chief of Library Journal, based in New York City. The leadership of the R.R. Bowker company, Library Journal's publisher, saw in Moon a personality they hoped would revive the struggling magazine and take it in new directions. Library Journal's fame dated back to the late 19th century with Melvil Dewey serving as its founding editor from 1876-1881. In his nine years as editor-in-chief, Moon changed Library Journal substantially, most noticeably by engaging the magazine in controversial issues and taking sides in the heated debates that characterized American librarianship during the period. Under Moon's editorship, Library Journal became known for its liberal, activist perspectives on the professional issues of the day. With Moon at the helm, Library Journal earned consistent profits from advertising revenues and sweeping interest marked by an increase in circulation. This change in direction was first defined by Moon's choice in 1960 to address racial segregation in Southern libraries, where African American librarians were not allowed to work in \\"white\\" libraries or participate in the library associations of Southern states. Until Moon, no mainstream publications so much as acknowledged the discrimination in library access. Moon soon realized that he needed support from black librarians to continue reporting accurately on activities in the South. Moon formed alliances with many, including Elonnie \\"E.J.\\" Josey who was an African American librarian at Savannah State College (Savannah, Georgia). Moon, along with Josey and countless others, advanced the concern of free access and integration of libraries and professional library associations. The debate over racially segregated libraries divided the profession at that time, and Moon's activist position placed his Library Journal in the camp of those in the profession who advocated significant change. Moon also tackled the largely protested Vietnam War. Moon's editorials continued to challenge the profession during the tumultuous 1960s. Likewise, Moon's credit includes Library Journal's treatment of censorship and book selection practices in libraries. This transformation made Library Journal popular reading for American librarians; by the mid-1960s the magazine was financially thriving. In 1965 Eric Moon was appointed to the Bowker Board of Directors. In that year he also became a citizen of the United States. Later life Moon quit his post as editor-in-chief of Library Journal in 1968, shortly after Bowker was acquired by the Xerox Corporation. In 1969 he was hired as the chief editor of Scarecrow Press, a small publisher with ties to the library community that had recently been purchased by the Grolier Educational Corporation (now a subsidiary of Scholastic, Inc.), taking over for founder Ralph Shaw. At Scarecrow, Moon rapidly increased the number of titles published per year, while introducing higher standards for editorial accuracy. (Scarecrow had been notorious for typographical errors in its books.) He also broadened the scope of the press beyond its traditional focus on library science topics to include religion and music, just to name a few. In 1971, Moon became the company's president. Moon retired from Scarecrow Press in 1978. Moon was much involved in the American Library Association (ALA) - its function, rules and policies throughout his American career. He had no qualms about criticizing the ALA, particularly regarding ALA's silence on the issue of racial prejudice and discrimination in libraries and library associations. By 1965, Moon was elected to the ALA Council. Moon ran for the office of Vice-President/President-Elect of the American Library Association as a petition candidate in 1976 and was elected. He was inaugurated in 1977. The major concern of his presidential year was to influence the development of a national information policy. Events in the profession during his term made it difficult to arouse strong interest in this goal within the association, whose leaders mostly lacked prior experience in the policy arena to begin with. Following his presidential year, Moon continued to influence ALA politics as a member of its governing Council and various committees into the mid-1990s. In 1987, Moon received ALA's top award, Honorary Membership. In 2000, Moon was bestowed the highest honor by the British library profession, the coveted Honorary Fellowship, awarded by the Library Association. Eric Moon retired to live in Sarasota, Florida, with his wife Ilse, who is also a retired librarian. He died there on 31 July 2016 at the age of 93.  Further reading  * Kister, Kenneth F.. 2002.

Welch and Seumas McNally. The game, originally based on an earlier series of Amiga games known as MegaBall, is patterned after classic ball-and-paddle arcade games such as Breakout and Arkanoid. A level editor was also made available as well. DX-Ball has been succeeded by three direct follow-ups: DX-Ball 2 (1998), Rival Ball (2001) and Super DX-Ball (2004).  Gameplay  The game is basically a Breakout clone: the player controls a paddle at the bottom and deflects a single ball, hitting different colored blocks on the top of the screen without having the ball fall below the screen. Clearing all the blocks results in completing the level and going to the next. There are 50 levels to complete. Similarly as Arkanoid and MegaBall, there is an inclusion of power- ups other than extra balls. Various power-ups appear when hitting random blocks, floating downwards towards the bottom and can be picked up by touching it with the paddle. If only a single block remains on a level and it continues to be untouched by the bouncing ball for a minute or so, an electricity sound begins to build and eventually the block is blasted away by a lightning. In certain levels, the layout of unbreakable blocks may allow the ball to become stuck in an infinite loop without touching the paddle. If this occurs, all unbreakable blocks will eventually replaced with the breakable ones after a minute or so of the ball being stuck in a bouncing pattern. Power-ups There are three neutral, ten positive and five negative powerups in the game. Neutral powerups can affect the gameplay in both positive and negative ways, depends on the situation, positive ones help in passing the level, while negative ones make the level more difficult. To alert the player, a loud warning sound will be heard if the player picks up a negative power-up. Most of the power-ups are directly taken from MegaBall with different names. New additions include FireBall, Set-Off Exploding, Shrink Ball, Split Ball, Super Shrink, and Fast Ball. In addition, there are also two unused negative power- ups called Gravity Ball and Magnetism, found in the game's internal coding and is a leftover from MegaBall. These two power-ups were dropped on the game's final development as it requires a more advanced game engine to render their effects yet their icons still remain in the coding files. Trivially, the game's function could be temporarily transformed into a shoot 'em up by using a hidden cheat code that enable the Shooting Paddle power-up at the player's control, at the cost of reduced points. History  MegaBall DX-Ball draws its main inspiration from the Amiga game MegaBall, programmed by Mackey Software in 1991‚Äì1993 for the Amiga. This game, originally a vast improvement upon Taito's Arkanoid, has several features that carried on to DX-Ball, such as similar power-ups, a large playfield (compared to other Breakout clone games), and both shares a same level background textures. In addition, both games also include a level editor. The original author released in 2012 the source code of MegaBall under the Apache license.megaball on snappymaria.com (2012)megaball on bitbucket.org DX-Ball development Michael P. Welch designed DX-Ball in 1996 as PC remake of MegaBall which was only available for the Amiga platform. According to a message of the programmer in the game's leaderboard screen, it was originally dedicated for Michael's wife, so that she can play something in the PC that was similar to her favorite Amiga game MegaBall. In the message, Michael himself even states that his wife enjoys MegaBall more than his own game, Scorched Tanks, which was probably his main motivation to design DX-Ball. Seumas McNally (1979‚Äì2000), whose programmed its sequel, has also contributed the game's 3D graphic design. DX-Ball expanded technically on the common Breakout-style game formula with smooth 16-bit graphics, highly stylized level designs, a wide array of power-ups, high quality sound effects and unique gameplay elements never seen before in a Breakout clone of its time. One interesting aspect of the game is that it renders on an exceptional 60 fps gameplay with any video cards, giving a vivid look and sophisticated smoothness. The game runs on either Direct X or Direct X 2 for the optimal quality. This feature was later carried on later games. Mac port In 2002, the game was ported to macOS (formerly known as Mac OS X) by Michael S. Austin, the author of CTSP Games and a friend of Michael Welch. While recycling the original gameplay and graphics, the Mac version introduces several new features, including four new in-game music, 2-player hotseat multiplayer, different title screen display, and an optional board pack expansion (DX-Ball Deluxe) of 150 additional boards (for a total of 200 boards). This version is a shareware, as the board expansion pack is only available in the registered version. The Mac version requires macOS version 6.0 or higher. However, it is not compatible on newer Intel-based Macs such as the MacBook or the iMac. Sequels DX-Ball has been succeeded by two direct follow-ups: DX-Ball 2 (1998) and Rival Ball (2001). While these were developed by Longbow Digital Arts, Michael Welch also released a remake in 2004 under BlitWise Productions, known as Super DX-Ball. In addition, Longbow Digital Arts also released a spin-off in the same year, known as Rival Ball Tournament. Unlike DX-Ball, these games are not freeware.
